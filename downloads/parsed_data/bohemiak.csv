"event","<i>look bitch. just cause youre a lesbian and your roommates arent, doesnt mean you have to go hating on them. im pretty sure they arent thrilled w/you either. you smell like shit and need a shower. if you dont like them...leave! you are allowed to do that you kno.

wow,i find it incredibly funny that you don't appreciate it when your roommates talk trash about you, but yet, you feel it necessary to comment about their lives. hmmm odd???? can we say hypocrit or better yet moron??? YAY!!! i knew you can, that's awesome. all those years of watching sesame street and mr. roger's obviously didn't turn you into a nice person but hey, it's all good right??? i guess the quote is true, it's better to let people think you're a moron rather than opening your mouth and removing all doubt....so YAY the world now know's katie is a moron.....WOOOOO HOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i>

hmm. first and foremost, it's always cool to first read someone's online journal (for whatever reason, i'm not sure) and then leave <i>anonymous</i> comments in which you swear at me, call me names, make ridiculous arguments, and make too many grammatical and spelling errors to count. while calling <i>me</i> stupid. not such effective debators, are we? 

to counter your accusations and verbal lacerations:

-i'm not a lesbian. though i can't imagine why that would matter. i was under the impression that my roommates were open minded--in fact, i believe i even discussed margaret atwood, who is a lesbian and writes about lesbian issues, with erin. i believe she said she loved her. but far be it from me to call anyone a ""hypocrit."" this matter aside, i don't think it necessary for me to defend my straight sexual orientation, so i won't. i don't care whether people think i'm a lesbian, honestly, because every lesbian i know is pretty cool. in fact, i'm in an english class called ""lesbian literature"" that i enjoy very much. so in a way, your calling me a lesbian is really a bit of a compliment. another flaw: you are a perfect example of the common dumbass misconception: ""feminists are lesbians."" please, try to stop being ignorant. i know it will be very hard, but do give it a good try. i'd very much appreciate it, as would the rest of the world. or at least don't pretend to be more intelligent than you are. as for this ""just cause youre a lesbian and your roommates arent, doesnt mean you have to go hating on them,"" i really don't know what to say. if i were a lesbian, how would that prompt me to go ""hating on"" my roommates? your argument is not only homophobic, it's downright illogical.

-i'm pretty sure my roomates aren't thrilled with me as well. i do believe i am correct in assuming that they (well, tara and erin, at least, i'm not sure about tehl) have been gossipping about me just as maliciously as they gossip about tehl. if it's because i ""smell like shit and need a shower,"" then that's just downright childish. though i do shower daily. this aside, i think it's really fucking hilarious that you are calling me ""smelly""--i was under the impression that that particular insult was confined to the third grade and under. but then, not everyone in college can be so mature. i'll forgive you for that insult, my feelings aren't too terribly hurt. :)

-i believe you'll note (by looking at my journal again) that i made some updates upon moving in in which i discussed how much i like my roomates, and how nice they are. i must have missed something along the way, however, because very soon they began treating me like something unpleasant found under a rock, ignoring me when i said hello to them, and no doubt gossipping about me behind my back. i was hoping we could be adults, but it became very apparent to me very quickly that that wasn't going to happen, and that gossipping and other elementary forms of insult would be utilized in my dorm room. i was disappointed, to say the least. 

-on to the next comment. i certainly don't care what my roommates think about me. at the time the post was written, i'd already overheard erin and tara gossipping rather visciously about tehl--calling her a ""slut"" and a ""slob."" i was so appalled and disgusted i felt like vomitting. as erin and tara had both been giving me the cold shoulder (for reasons yet unknown to me), i assumed that they were gossipping about me just as viciously. i was disappointed by this because i hadn't done anything wrong, at least to my knowledge, but as long as they kept their slander behind my back so i wouldn't have to deal with it, i was quite fine. up until that point i'd been a pretty neutral roommate, i think. i wasn't in the room very often, so no one could accuse me of getting in their way or using their stuff or whatever. my space is confined to my bed, my desk, and my clothing area. i kept my areas clean and didn't leave any of my shit laying around. i didn't gossip, and i tried to compromise as much as possible in our living situation. so, it was utterly beyond me why we wouldn't be getting along--and we certainly weren't. but i'll talk about that in a second.

-your accusations of hypocrisy or moronism (because i comment about my roommates in my journal): this is my journal. period. i take full liberties at not censoring what i write. if someone is being a bitch to me, i vent in my journal. my roommates were in fact being bitches to me, so i vented about it in my journal. now, alternatively, what i could have done was confront them and cause an argument. or i could have talked to my RA, who would have set up a meeting with all of us, wasting time and energy. i'd hoped that if i got my frustrations out on my own journal and remained passive and neutral, whatever qualms my roomates had with me would settle themselves. i figured it was just the stress of moving in, whatever. by writing about my roomates in my journal, i was remaining passive and peaceful. the fact that you chose to read my journal--which in and of itself is a bit disturbing, i'll keep my entries protected from now on--is just that. your choice. if you can't take the fact that i vent my frustrations in my journal rather than being bitchy and gossiping maliciously, then that's your problem. personally i'd rather we all vented in our journal than gossip, but that's just me. i can't tell others what to do.

-after this in the comment, my understanding of you become a bit hazy. for instance, i don't understand this sentence, <i>i knew you can, that's awesome.</i> bit random, really. or: <i>all those years of watching sesame street and mr. roger's obviously didn't turn you into a nice person but hey, it's all good right??</i> i'm not sure why sesame street nor mr. rogers were brought up--while i did indee watch mr. rogers, i didn't watch sesame street. just to clear that up. i'm not sure what my roomates watched as children, but i'm assuming they watched something which taught them to gossip, slander, and be bitchy for no good reason. but children tv shows is an entirely different discussion that i won't go into here. feel free to contact me at a later date, bryan, and we can discuss the matter. also, this sentence <i>really</i> mystifies me: <i>i guess the quote is true, it's better to let people think you're a moron rather than opening your mouth and removing all doubt....so YAY the world now know's katie is a moron.....WOOOOO HOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i> i literally have no fucking clue what quote is being discussed here, so i'm just going to leave that one alone. if you're talking about ""it's better to let people think you're a moron rather than opening your mouth and removing all doubt,"" well, dandy! you thought i was a moron before i started speaking, but when i opened my mouth, you were sure of it. absolutely profound proverb. what, are you a buddhist monk or something? such insights! truly amazing. 

-lastly, the title of your comment: ""the stupidity of one infects the lives of many."" thanks a ton for describing yourself. saves me the trouble.

now that that's over, we can all become adults and discuss this matter maturely. 

<b>ERIN</b>: i'm going to assume, correctly, i think, that you were the one to go for a surf on my journal. why you did so, i'm not sure. saturday night entertainment? nothing better to do, so you thought you'd read my journal for entertainment, kind of like the way you break into tehl's myspace and read her shit? i think that's kind of weird, and from now on i'll be keeping my entries protected, but nonetheless. i'm not going to judge your twisted forms of entertainment. your choice. however, with that choice, you've got to be prepared to take what you read. i don't censor my journals. i'm against censorship, and i utilize my rights of free speech wholly, especially in my own personal journal. hell, you do to--without this lovely amendment you'd be arrested for slandering tehl's name as harshly as you do. 

but i'm not going to criticize you. i'm not going to get involved in matters of petty elementary bullshit, like gossipping. it's your choice if you want to be so unabashedly nasty. true, i was appalled when i heard you calling tehl a ""slut,"" ""whore,"" and a ""slob,"" and i immediately realized that you were probably talking about me the same way, and i cringe every time you say ""faggot"" (which is a lot, even though you claim you participated in the day of silence and are pro-gay rights...lately lots of your actions have been blatantly homophobic, which is pathetic), but as long as you didn't pick arguments and get me involved in your immaturity, i was willing to ignore the gossipping and derogitory terminology. when you treated me like shit by giving me the cold shoulder and ignoring me when i talked to you, i did my best to ignore it. i didn't confront you; i didn't think we needed an argument so soon after moving in. maybe i was wrong, maybe i should have confronted you--none of this would have happened. instead, however, i took my frustrations to my journal and vented. i wrote words in anger, words i'd never utter in person. i wrote these words in <i>my journal</i>...they were not meant to be seen by you nor any of my roomates. they were not meant to hurt your feelings or pick a fight. they were words of <i>venting</i>. i was angry and hurt that you were treating me the way you were for no reason i was conscious of--the only thing i could think of was that perhaps you disliked my music, or my paintings (which were hung by my bed, not harming anyone or anything. it's hard to even see them if you're not lying in my bed), or even, as you stated above, something as pathetically immature as the way i supposedly smell.  i was hurt that you'd treat me with such utter unfriendliness when i hardly know you, and when i was personally doing the best i could to be peaceful and get along with everyone. we have to spend an entire year living in eachothers' presence, it seems logical to me that we get along. however, the way you treated me and the way you gossipped about tehl conveyed to me that you obviously thought differently--getting along didn't matter much to you. you'd rather criticize people. gossip about them. slander their fucking names. calling someone a ""slut"" or a ""whore"" is downright malicious, i can't believe you did that. i felt terribly for tehl...yet i let it pass, hoping that you'd stop and tehl wouldn't find out. i was avoiding conflict at all costs. maybe i should have spearheaded the issue right away and confronted you rather than turning a blind eye and venting in my journal. instead, i avoided conflict and vented. one particular day, both you and tara had treated me terribly--neither of you would even look at me, and you ignored me when i spoke to you. even tehl seemed cool that day--i was taken aback because she and i at least had seemed to get along fine. it had been a rough day for me, so i let loose my frustrations in my journal, my only outlet. even if i'd wanted to gossip i couldn't have, because both you and tara seemed to hate me, and tehl is always with faron. i was frustrated and hurt almost to the point of tears. the slough of rants you obviously read in my journal in which i wrote mean things about you and tara (i don't think i wrote anything mean about tehl) were written after i'd been treated like shit by you and tara. i would never have written anything like that without reason or cause. i am truly sorry that you read those things--i wrote them a while ago under the impression that none of you would ever read them, and i believed that lately we've been getting along much better. i haven't wanted to rock the boat, but at least you and tara had started talking to me again. obviously the things written in my journal were harsh--again, i wrote those things in anger and hurt. if you'll look at some other entries i wrote--around the 30th of august or the 1st of september, you'll notice that when i first met you i liked you a lot. i thought all of my roomates were very nice and interesting, and i thought we'd get along well. i didn't begin to write nasty things about you in my journal until you began to be nasty towards me. i'm sorry, maybe you didn't mean it, but when i say hello to you and you give me a dirty look without responding, it's hard to think anything different. i did my best to remain friendly and peaceful to you and tehl and tara, even when you started treating me like shit, but i had to vent in my journal. i'm sorry that you read it, but it's not my fault. maybe you shouldn't snoop in other peoples' private things if you don't want to read things you don't like.

<b>TARA</b>: much of what i said to erin applies to you, as well. while i never heard you personally call tehl a ""slut"" or ""whore"", you were gossipping with erin--it takes two to gossip. again, it wasn't my business and i was staying out of it, but judging by the way you and erin suddenly refused to speak or even look at me, i figured that the two of you were gossipping about me just as much as you were about tehl. again, disappointing, i originally thought you were very nice. i enjoyed getting lunch with you the day i met you--i thought you seemed sweet and quiet and friendly. i thought we'd get along well. when you began ignoring me and acting like i didn't exist, i was hurt. i vented in my journal. i avoided conflict at all costs. i know erin will probably inform you that i wrote mean things about you in my journal...when i wrote anything, i wrote it in anger after you began to treat me like shit. rather than confronting you, i put my feelings into my journal. they were not personal attacks, and they were not meant to hurt your feelings. i was going to all lengths to remain peaceful in our room. even when i was the one being treated shittily. i put my frustrations in MY personal journal. working under the assumption, of course, that you'd never read them. i never meant for you to find out the things i wrote about you--probably the same way you'd never want me to find out what you and erin gossipped about me. there was a lot of unchecked animosity breeding in our room, and i tried to stay away from it by venting my feelings in my journal, as i said. lately it seemed we'd been getting along much better, and i was happy. you and i had exchanged friendly conversations. i stopped venting in my journal. i'd hoped you and erin had stopped gossipping about me. i was willing to forgive and forget. however, erin decided to go journal surfing while i was gone and see what was going on inside my head, and she found the entries from a few weeks back where i vented my frustrations that my roomates and i weren't getting along. and she decided to show them to her friend. i'm sure she'll inform you of their content. you can have a nice long gossip session about me. if you want. or, you could accept my apology right now and we could all grow up and forget the animosity that is between us for whatever reason. i apologize for writing nasty things about you in my own personal journal. i apologize that i didn't protect my journal from prying eyes. i apologize that i didn't confront you about the hurt i felt when you treated me like shit. i am sorry for hurting your feelings, if i did, but with all due respect, you hurt mine. i was willing to forget as long as i had my journal for venting, but as my journal has been made public to my roomates, that fell through. 

<b>TEHL</b>: as far as i know, we've gotten along from the start. i never had any problems with you. i always thought you were friendly. i don't believe i ever wrote anything nasty about you in my journal. i never had reason to. i thought we got along very well. if any nasty references were made to ""my roomates"" in my journal, i'm sory for not specifying--you were not included in those rants. tara and erin had been gossipping about both of us and treating me like shit, and it hurt my feelings, so i vented about them in my journal. i emphasize: MY JOURNAL. i avoided conflict and got out my frustrations in the only way i knew possible. i'm sorry if erin showed you anything and it hurt your feelings...it wasn't directed at you, at all. 

<b>TO ALL OF YOU</b>: i am truly sorry this can of worms was ever opened. i'm sorry my journal was read for entertainment, i'm sorry the things i wrote in anger and didn't mean were read and broadcasted. i am <i>very</i> sorry that we aren't getting along--i still have no idea why. if i've ever done anything to any of you personally that would prompt you to dislike me so passionately, (aside from writing in my journal frustratedly after having been treated like shit) please inform me of the instance. as far as i know, i've done my best to keep the peace and remain diplomatic. 

i would like for you to accept my apologies. i would ideally like to be apologized to for the gossipping that happened behind my back and for being treated like shit on various occasions, but i'm willing to simply forgive and forget without apologies. i would like this year to be peaceful and free of conflict. i would like very much for the four of us to get along peacably. i would like for all four of us to act maturely--to NOT gossip, to say hello when someone greets us, and to most of all compromise a bit for the sake of peace. i would like for communication to be prevalent--when someone has a problem with something, rather than gossipping, i would like to talk about it. maybe i'm simply being idealistic. maybe none of you will forgive me, will hold grudges and prefer this year to be a living hell. which sucks. i will be very disappointed if this is what you choose. however, i am not requesting a room assignment. my life is far too stressful and busy right now to worry about such things. i have to work and go to class so that i can pay my way and keep my scholarship. if i didn't work or go to class fulltime, i would not be going to college. i'm sure none of you know how it feels to be on the very edge of whether you will or will not be able to afford college, but i really don't want to waste time on these stupid, immature, and petty arguments when i need to be doing other things to survive. i will do everything in my power to ensure that this will not happen again, but i am merely 1/4 of the room. i don't have the power to swing your decisions.

i am going to spend at least a few days at my sister's house while this hopefully cools down. please comment on here, i'm asking you, or email me, so we can resolve this issue. i'm not interested in who's right and who's wrong--if you feel the need to condemn me some more or explain why you were bitchy to me, that's fine, but frankly, it doesn't matter. i am choosing to put this ALL behind me and start over fresh, i hope that you will be willing to do the same. so please comment on here or email me and let me know your decision on this matter. if you'd like, we can have an intelligent, mature, slander-free discussion when i come back to the dorms later this week, if not, that's fine as well. i hope we can resolve this amongst ourselves as the adults that we are. you can reach me at bohemiak@hotmail.com if you'd rather email me than comment on this entry."

"event","i'm in an exceedingly weird mood. sort of melancholy, very calm, sort of tired, sort of weary. but it's not a bad mood. just sort of a ""sighing"" mood, per se. if that means anything.

anyways, classes today were good. i was so tired all day, that kind of took away from my learning experiences in celtic film and advertising, but certainly not in lesbian lit. we had one of the best discussions yet...i swear, it was so incredibly open i felt charged with it. i felt so light and free, able to discuss things so openly. it was truly lovely. and we all laughed a lot. which is always good. we were talking about some of the ways lesbians are viewed by different people today. i brought up the fact that lots of guys think lesbianism is hot if it involves pretty girls. kate wrote on the board: ""HOT!"" and asked us where that can be seen--someone brought up porn. so she wrote porn on the board and drew and arrow pointing to the word ""hot"". one of the girls pointed out the way that looked on the chalkboard and what it would look like to the class that came in after us, and we all had a nice big laugh. it looked like ""porn-->HOT!"" lol. good times. but it was a great class, and it put me in a great mood.

i've been frustratingly contemplative lately, and i can't get all these piles of thoughts out of my brain. i have to sort them out, but right now i'm too tired. i think i'll go about the task of responding to emails/comments now, and then sign off and take a nap. perhaps i can make a substantial update later on.

"event","arrgh. there's so much i want to do right now, among them reply to emails/comments i received today (i read them all, just so you know), make an update about the updates in my life and the two very strange dreams i had last night (must not forget, must not forget...i'll leave myself two keywords with which to remember them by: pregnant and dogs--don't ask, i shall elaborate when time permits--ok, i'm sorry, i'm still under the delusion that you care about my ramblings...i apologize *retreats to corner, babbling nonsensically to self*), and do my general daily babble that's so immensely cleansing, but it's already 9:22 and i am in serious need of sleep. this getting up at 6 am thing every day is really not a ton of fun...i ended up taking a shower last night and sleeping in until (*gasp*) 7:00 this morning. it was still painful to get out of my nice comfy bed. and it <i>is</i> comfy, surprisingly. i've been doing my english homework since 3:30 pm--i took <i>7 1/2 pages of notes</i> on one goddamn essay. i don't know what got into me. it was like a compulsion that i couldn't control. i just kept writing and writing in this infuriatingly neat handwriting in an infuriatingly organized and detailed format, and i <i>couldn't stop</i>, no matter how loudly my hand screamed in pain. i just kept writing and writing. very strange indeed. anyways, that took me far too long to get through, and by the time i'd finished reading the other short story for english, i was late in posting my response on D2L (desire to learn...we have discussion forums and certain people are assigned to respond to assignments on certain days...today was my day--we're supposed to post by 8 pm). but that's not entirely my fault...there wasn't even a category to post under yet. i posted it under a different category, then the proper category was established by kate, and i reposted it under that one, but by then it was late. anyways, my response was very long-winded and kind of rambling, but i think i give a good impression of knowing what the hell i'm talking about. hehe. jk. i really did, i just found it hard to condense the 7 1/2 pages of notes into two small paragraphs...my response is way longer than it should be. i find it incredibly hard to write small things. everything i write ends up being much longer than it should be...this journal entry is a perfect example. but anyways. i will write a slightly more competent post tomorrow and respond to all the emails i received and do all the cyber-y things i really want to do right now but won't because sleep is more valuable than my long-winded journal. again, i'm under the impression that you care. but i'm going to shut up and go to bed now. wow.

but before i do so (heh heh, you thought i was finally going to shut up, didn't you?), i'm going to post my response on here under a cut. just because i can. marvel at it's long-windedness. keep in mind here that i'm still under the impression that you listen to me rambling from my little rubber corner of the universe.  but you should really check out ""miss ogilvy finds herself"" by radclyffe hall--it's crazy. i really liked it, but was kind of stumped as to what to write about it...it's touch to analyze. anyways, without further ado. <lj-cut text=""i may very well just be the only one who will ever click on this link and read it's cut contents. and that's just okay."">

In ""Contributions of the Sexologists,"" Lillian Faderman catalogs the sexologists' explanations for the ""phenomena"" of lesbianism and homosexual love in general at the turn of the century. Faderman especially highlights the works of Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis, sexologists of the late 19th century who theorized that lesbianism is a result of ""cerebral anomalies,"" relating it to violence, homicide, and suicide. They labeled lesbianism ""inversion,"" that is, an inversion of emotions and everything a ""normal woman"" should be. At the time Krafft-Ebing and Ellis were studying lesbianism, women were just beginning to enter the workplace and fjord independent lives for themselves, when for so long they'd been nothing but submissive accessories to man's needs. Romantic friendship had not only been tolerated up to that point, but also encouraged. However, now that economic independence was beginning to be possible for women, this feminine solidarity was seen as a threat to patriarchal society--if women could work, and didn't NEED men or marriage--if they eventually became independent, who knew what could happen? The threat was growing, and so sexologists like Ellis cast a morbid light upon romantic friendship and cases of lesbianism which were arising. Calling these women abnormal and even insane, Ellis separated lesbians from society by diagnosing them with neuropathic degeneration, and went so far as to exclude them from the realms of the female sex. He created a third sex to fit the ""inverted"" women. Ironically, women embraced Krafft-Ebing's and Ellis's exclusion, finally having a sufficient excuse to break away from the hearth and marriage--which up until then had been their curse. If they had a disease, a cerebral disorder, they had an excuse to exclude themselves and live apart from ""normal"" life for women of that time. They formed entire communities of ""inverted"" women, celebrating their abnormalities and acquiring life-long partnerships with other like-minded women. They became successful in careers and lived long, happy, unmarried lives. However, the world took little notice and merely marveled at these women as if they were somehow deformed--medical studies ensued and novels dramatized the ""abnormalities"" which were suddenly out in the open.

Radclyffe Hall illustrates the life of one such abnormal woman. Miss Ogilvy has, for as long as she can remember, not fit in with her feminine counterparts. As a child she'd rather have lifted weights and played football with boys than play dolls with her sisters, she longed to join the business world and enjoy the abounding opportunities that were men's, yet she had always been confined to a life of the mundane. When war was declared, Miss Ogilvy felt the primal urge to ship out with the soldiers and fight on the front lines, where it was most dangerous. Yet she was a woman, and her gene configuration prevented her from pursuing this dream. She found a way, however, to be there on the front lines, digging the wounded out of the trenches and risking her life. While in the thick of the war, Miss Ogilvy nearly forgot her sex and the cursed life of submission which she was forced to endure. But it all ended too soon, and Miss Ogilvy was sent back to England to live a quiet, dull life with her loathsome sisters. Time passed and Miss Ogilvy grew older and more irksome, and increasingly worried that she was whiling away the precious last moments of her life so unhappily. So, on a whim, Miss Ogilvy sails out to a tiny, remote island upon which the only civilization is one hotel, owned by the same person who owns the entire island. This woman shows Miss Ogilvy the ancient remains of a warrior killed in battle, and Miss Ogilvy reacts in a most uncharacteristically emotional manner. That night she has a dream in which she is a tribal man, thousands of years prior to the present-day Miss Ogilvy, on the island. She is strong, robust, and uninhibited. Spending an evening with a young tribal woman, Miss Ogilvy is overcome with an immense satisfaction and peace. Miss Ogilvy dies happy, and is found dead sitting at the mouth of the cave in the morning. Her dream was a manifestation of who Miss Ogilvy longs to be, her deepest desires of what she wishes her life could have been. Miss Ogilvy is a representation of the ""inverted"" woman--longing for a life that was not yet socially accepted (and hardly is today) at the time she was alive. Her life was a sad testament to the inequalities these women were forced to endure, and the fact that they were made to feel tainted and unnatural simply because their lifestyle threatened the heirarchy of patriarchal society.

"event","well, i do believe i'll go on this retreat. so i won't be around this weekend.

so there's this huge ass storm moving through milwaukee right now...severe thunderstorm warning, tornado watch, etc. i shouldn't be surprised--it's been hot and really windy all day. but <i>god</i>...from the 23 floor, it's fucking incredible. exhilirating, but fucking scary. we had the windows open, and it felt like there <i>was</i> a tornado...the posters on the walls were rattling so loudly you had to shout to be heard. doors were slamming shut of their own accord from the wind--all our shit was flying off our desks and shelves all around the room. the wind was <i>screaming</i>--literally, screaming--through the windows. just standing there, my hair was flying all around me like medusa, and i had to hold on to something heavy so i wouldn't be blown over. it took two people pulling with all our might to close the window. we could see people below outside on bikes and being blown off course...riding in crooked or zigzagged lines. haha. the sky looked fucking ominous...dark and swirly and angry looking. i actually saw lightning touch down not far from campus. trees were tossing about madly, and erin saw a huge tree branch fly past our window. lol. fucking crazy. before i left to go down to dinner (i figured if there was a tornado, i'd be safer on the 3rd floor rather than the 23rd, hehe) i secured all my shit just to be safe. it was freaky.

"event","well, today has been a genuinely fucking good day! i'm very pleased with how it played out. i think it was my choice to listen to hail to the theif this morning that brought me good luck. thank you radiohead, i'll be listening to you quite often from now on. 

<i>so</i>. i totally owned today's discussion in my english class. agh! i feel so charged. it could just be because our reading was a book of poetry by katherine philips and the book of ruth from the bible, and i can analyze away poetry and draw lots of interpretations much more accurately than i can with essays. essays are more concrete, there's less room for personal interpretation, whereas poems are more lyrical (obviously) and can be dissected, at least to me, more easily. but then i'm certainly a more creative than scientific writer, so it could just be me. anyways, i made lots and lots of contributions today...i was among the five or six who contributed most to the discussion. don't get me wrong--i'm not bragging or anything--i'm just feeling better about my mental capacity now that i know that my intellect doesn't fall short of everyone in that class. there's a hell of a lot of very intelligent women (and 1 man, hehe) in there, definitely some that are much more intelligent than me, but as i've been told and have since gathered, 1) i am relatively young and will gain wisdom with time, 2) i will learn lots and lots from these women and this class, and 3) i'm not a complete dunce. but this class just reinforced those realizations and now i'm feeling much better about myself in general. and damnit, i'm proud that i was able to contribute in an upper-level class, i'm not afraid to admit it. it's pretty intimidating, but i think i deserve to pat myself on the back a bit for getting over it and contributing. sometimes i can be too hard on myself in that context--i'm wowed by someone's intellect and i end up thinking of myself as an ignoramus in comparison. it's not very self-loving, so i'm glad i got past that...at least for now. it means i'm growing up. i can feel myself changing daily, really becoming an adult. it's a bit scary, it's very isolating, and it's even a bit painful, but it's making me stronger. in a way i'm glad i'm going this period without any friends (hehe), because if i had friends or connections, i'd probably be out partying all the time and totally forfeitting the college adjustment period. and i wouldn't be paying attention in class, which is very necessary for my classes (besides, they're <i>damn</i> interesting...i think i've learned more in my classes in the first week of college than i did my entire 4 years of high school). anyways, my point is, i overcame a little obstacle and became an active participant in my english class among the scary and brainy upperclasswomen/man. and i feel good about that.

yesterday i sent out like 7 emails to clubs here at uwm, asking for info on how to join/get involved. i got two emails back, one from alliance for animals, who gave me info on the first meeting and said i'm welcome to come. the second one i just received is from rainbow group (the gay/straight alliance-esque club here). not only did they invite me to join, but they also invited me to attend the student leadership retreat that's happening this weekend! it sounds really cool, and it's free. here's the email they sent back to me:

<i>Katie,

I am the staff advisor for the Rainbow group, but, I saw your email and think
you would really be a great candidate for our student leadership retreat that
is happening this weekend! I know it is short notice, but it will change your
college experience at UWM, I know.

The retreat is for students who want to develop their leadership skills. It is
free, and we leave on Saturday morning at 8:15am (sept 17) and go to camp
minikani (near germantown). We do many leadership development activiites such a
as a low ropes course, teambuilding excercises, a bonfire social and other fun
activities.

This is a great way to get connected to other students who want to make a
difference and be leaders.

To participate just give me the following info:

NAME:
ADDRESS:
EMAIL ADDRESS:
PHONE:
ARE YOU A VEGETARIAN?
DO YOU NEED ANY SPECIAL ACCOMODATIONS?

Okay, Katie, welcome to UWM, I hope you can come to the retreat!

peace,

Laurie Marks</i>

i think they invited me because i mentioned the stuff i did with day of silence at whs. which is really cool. so do you folks think i should attend? i don't have any plans for the weekend, and seeing as how i have no friends, it kind of seems like a win-win situation. at least i'd most likely be meeting cool people. so i dunno, i was really excited about this. it seems very cool. i think i may just accept. 

so that's been my good day. both my celtic studies and advertising classes were enlightening as usual. i'm learning sooooo much here, i can't even articulate how good it feels to be gaining useful and interesting knowledge for once, instead of processed shit that i don't need to know. college = very good things. :):):)"

<i>Friends,

There is much to be said and done about the manmade annihilation of New Orleans, caused NOT by a hurricane but by the very specific decisions made by the Bush administration in the past four and a half years. Do not listen to anyone who says we can discuss all this later. No, we can't. Our country is in an immediate state of vulnerability. More hurricanes, wars, and other disasters are on the way, and a lazy bunch of self-satisfied lunatics are still running the show.

So, in the next few days, I will write to you about what must be done about Bush and Co.

But today I want you to join with me in bypassing the colossally inept and incompetent Bush administration and get help DIRECTLY to the people of the New Orleans area -- right now.

A lot of you have written me to ask what you can do. Many don't know who to trust. Many want to do more than write a check. You are right to think that writing checks to relief agencies will not get water and aid to people in the next 48 hours. Checks will be needed later and can be written later.

I have a way, though, for each and every one of us to do something today that can affect people's lives TODAY.

For the past few days I've been working with a group that, I guarantee you, will get direct aid to the people who need it most.

Cindy Sheehan, the brave woman who dared to challenge Mr. Bush at his summer home, has now sent her Camp Casey from in front of Bush's ranch to the outskirts of New Orleans. The Veterans for Peace have taken all the equipment and staff of volunteers and set up camp in Covington, Louisiana, on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. They are accepting materials and personally distributing them to those in need.

This is where we come in. We need to ship supplies to them immediately. Today they need the following:

<b>Paper plates, paper towels, toilet paper, baby diapers, baby wipes, baby formula, Pedialyte, baby items in general, powder, lotion, handy wipes, sterile gloves, electrolytes, LARGE cans of veggies, school supplies, and anything else to lift people's spirits.</b>

You can ship these items by following the instructions on VFPRoadTrips.org. Or you can deliver them there in person. The roads to Covington are open. You can drop them off or you can stay and participate (if you stay, you'll be camping so bring your own tent and gear and mosquito spray).

If you can't ship these items or go there in person, then go to VFPRoadTrips.org and make an immediate donation through PayPal. Camp Casey-Covington will have immediate access to this cash and can buy the items themselves from stores that are open in Louisiana (all donations to Veterans for Peace, are tax deductible).

Each day I will post up-to-the minute information as to what is needed and the progress Camp Casey is making. Please visit MichaelMoore.com often and do what you can to help.

Many other groups are also doing good work. MoveOn.org has set up a system for people to offer rooms in their homes to the survivors.

There is no time to waste. People are suffering and dying. Each of us can do something. There is no other alternative.

Thank you in advance for your help. Tomorrow, we will take care of the other work we need to do about the ideologically hamstrung incompetents in charge.

Yours,
Michael Moore

"event","i am officially in love with ann sexton.

heidi turned me on to her two nights ago. i took BOSS to her apartment. she greeted me with a tap dancing instructional tape and declared that tonight we would learn how to tap dance. haha. we planned the evening: first we would share some wine (chardonnay this time) and when we were good and buzzing, we'd learn to tap dance. then we'd light a candle and read female-centric poetry aloud to eachother before watching <i>the vagina monologues</i>. so...heidi was moving the tv into the living room from her bedroom and dropped it and broke the vcr. lol. we tried in vain for a long time to extract the jammed tape (anne of green gables) from the vcr), then gave up and decided to read the poetry. i read ann sexton while she read a pablo neruda, then a female author--i forgot the name. we enjoyed it immensely, and when we were finished spent a while discussing why poetry should almost always be read aloud. we also had a lovely cuntlovin discussion, a result of the happy women poetry. for some reason afterward we went into heidi's room and began recording ourselves singing various songs and laughing hysterically as we played back the result. it was really fun, and we lost track of time and ended up not watching <i>vagina monologues</i>. went back to the living room. started watching <i>the wall</i> but heidi was too tired and i had to be up at 6 the next morning for orientation, so i shut it off and we went to sleep.

i woke early the next morning and bussed back to campus, and walked back to my dorm. it was very nice walking in the still morning air. not many people around, and just the calmness of the beginning of a beautiful day. very enjoyable. when i got back to my dorm, tehl and erin were up and groggy, because our fourth roomie, tara, would be moving in at 8 and they wanted to tidy the place up a bit. since my crap was clean and organized, i didn't have to do anything. i took a shower and got dressed and ready, then rushed down to the cafeteria and grabbed some packaged food for breakfast to take along to orientation, then hurried down to the EMS, where i was supposed to meet. met lisa muche on the way for the third time and walked down with her, since she didn't know where to go. got to my orientation room, which was pretty packed, and sat down next to some random chick. everyone was sleepy and staring blank-faced around. our group leader was nervous, and i'm sorry to say, a dismal public speaker. i felt really bad for her, but it was almost painful to watch. we spent most of the morning watching her trying to figure out something to say to us. it sucked and was dreadfully boring. at 10:30 we went to the union ballroom or somewhere so the dean and student advisors could talk to us and stuff. it was boring, but i sort of befriended the chick i was sitting next to. she's a commuter student, and our one single common interest is that we both love to read, and are both obsessed with harry potter. haha. she doesn't party and we're very different, so i can't see much friendship sprouting out of that, but nevertheless, she was nice, and i was glad to have someone to talk to finally. there were one or two cute boys in my group, but they were kind of typical dumb freshman boys, for lack of a better description, and i could only look at them in a sort of exasperated attraction. hehe. no worries, i much prefer singlehood to anything at this point. good boys are rare, and i don't feel like sacrificing myself for someone lame, aside from meaningless flings.

anyways, the dean & co. spoke for a long time, during which i created a symbol, as heidi had requested i do. haha. not really sure why, but she showed me a symbol she created and told me i should do the same. so i did. well, i have two different designs, i'm not sure which one i'll use. but whatever. after the dean spoke, we all went to lunch and i had a nice excited conversation with my friend jenny about harry potter. hehe. the sun was hot and direct and i got sunburned again, but not terribly. the chancellor spoke during lunch and it was impossible to hear him...not that i wished to. after lunch we went back to the classroom, then went outside to do a ""crossing the line"" activity for diversity purposes...we all had to stand on a line and step forward as the leader made statments that applied to us--for exampled, if she read ""i regularly practice a religion"" and you do, you were supposed to step across the line, pause, then step back. hehe. it was kind of funny. there were only like four other people who stepped forward when she said, ""i have red hair"" and even fewer when she said ""i have lost a parent."" kind of dumb. after doing a few more stupid activities like this, we toured campus for a long time. i realized with dismay that it was a terrible idea to wear my long skirt...by the end of they day i had the worst heat rash imaginable. i didn't think we'd walk around so much, but i probably should have known. it totally sucked. i had a raging headache by the end of the day because of the sun. orientation was supposed to end at 4:30, but when we went back to our room at 3:15 and there was really nothing left to do--we were all too hot and tired for anything--she let us go early, at 4. it was a pointless, boring day, but i made a sort-of friend and exchanged contact info. also got a compliment on my purse and necklace (the wooly purse from summerfest and a wooden beady necklace) by a chick in my group who'd declared her love for bob marley in the ""get to know you"" activities. so that was cool. i probably should have asked her about partying, but she had on headphones most of the time and didn't seem to want to interact much. and that might have been an awkward question, just out of the blue like that. anyways, during our tour, our guide allowed those of us who hadn't yet to pick up our upass, so i got that taken care of.

as soon as orientation was dismissed, i made my way to the third floor of the union and asked to speak to lucie, the girl who called me from employment. they led me to her office and said she'd be back in a minute. finally she appeared, and we talked, and she explained that another lady was taking care of my application, but she wasn't there. she apologized, but said that whenever the lady was back--probably tomorrow--she'd call me or email me. but lucie seemed pretty positive--was asking when i could work and said they really needed employment. the thing that sort of sucks is that i'll probably get stuck in the taco bell in the union. ew, ew, ew. but whatever, it's a job and lord knows i need one, and besides, if i'm gonna work in a union eatery i'd prefer to work at taco bell because they pay $6, whereas everywhere else only pays $5.15. really, i don't care, i just want a job. 

anyways, when i got back to my dorm, beat and hot and heat-rashy, my new roomie tara was in the room. i introduced myself and struck up a mild conversation, feeling more social than usual because of all the human interaction during the day. she seemed sort of shy but friendly, so when i'd changed out of my skirt and put my hair up, i asked if she'd like to go to dinner with me. she said she'd had a late lunch and wasn't hungry but would be happy to accompany me, so i went upstairs to see if my friend heidi would like to come with us, and she said sure and brought her roommate dion and a chick named megan and her friend, whose name i forgot. they were all easy to talk to and i was glad to have companions. we went to the cafeteria and saw that they'd closed early, at 2, for whatever fucking reason. i'm so tired of that place--it's never open when you need it, and they're constantly changing the hours. we all made our way over to the union and decided to eat there. i got a sub. we ate and had easy conversation and it was very enjoyable. when we were leaving to go back to the dorms, somehow the topic of ""partying"" was brought up. i asked tara if she partied or drank at all, and she said no. didn't say she wanted to, so i won't corrupt her. unfortunately. haha. we met one of heidi's sister's friends (her sister is a sophomore at uwm) and she informed us that there was a party tonight at one of their friend's places and we were welcome to come. yay! finally, a party. i agreed, and went back to the dorm to relax for a while before heidi told me we had to leave. after a while i got ready for the party, and we went to the front of sandburg to wait for BOSS (the party was on bartlett). it took almost an hour for BOSS to finally come, but it did, and we were off. arrived at the party, which wasn't really a party yet. a sophomore girl had just moved into the house with two other girls and was throwing a small get together for her close friends. the house was really nice, and the girl was really nice, but fuck, i had no idea who anyone was. but whatever, free booze is free booze. i had a large cup of hypnotiq. it was ok--not a huge fan of mixed fruit drinks like that (it was vodka, cognac, and fruit juice), but it did the trick, at any rate. i wasn't drunk, but by the end of the leinies i had afterward, i had a nice buzz. by then like 6 more people had come, and everyone knew everyone except me. haha. i was obviously out of place and it was very awkward, so i said i'd call BOSS (they only run until 11 since school's not started) while i could and go back, saying that i had a headache and needed sleep. they were nice, but obviously didn't care, so i sat on the porch and talked to heidi until BOSS arrived. i got in the car and noticed that the driver was really hot. haha. sorry, no other way to put it. he was really really hot. totally had the whole starving poet thing going on, and he spoke in a voice barely above a whisper so that i was never really sure if he was talking or if it was just  background noise from the radio. he was listening to npr jazz hour, one of my favorites, and drove hunched over the steering wheel in a really weird position. haha. we picked up another chick before he dropped us off. i was sorry to see him go, he was fascinating to watch. but i was slightly drunk and tired, and went up to my room. erin was in the tv room with a guy friend from the 3rd floor watching a movie. i said hi, changed into my pj's, and proceeded to try to arrange my clothes in a better way. popped some popcorn, turned on some ladytron, and relaxed. it was nice. when erin's friend left, we talked for a while, and then washed up and went to bed at the same time. she's really cool, i like her a lot. tehl was out partying, and tara was out too. tehl got home before tara--i don't think tara came home last night. anyways, they've all got orientation today, lucky them, so i've had the dorm to myself and have been blasting ladytron and bad religion and NIN and truly savoring the empty dorm room. it's SO nice.

i went to a mandatory dorm meeting last night. i was sitting on the floor, and in front of me a girl with dredlocks and the wooden earings i used to have sat. she looked cool, so when we were on the elevator after the meeting was over, i complimented her on her earrings, told her i used to have the same ones, and asked where she got them. we had a short conversation--she was really friendly and judging by the fact that she was alone was just as friendless as i. i wanted to get to know her, but my floor came up and i got off the elevator. i was sorry to go. i think she lives on the 25th floor--i hope we meet up again. maybe she can be my essential companion. hehe. seriously, cool people are hard to come by.

anyways, this morning i decided that i don't much like bras. so i decided not to wear one. they cut in and put excess pressure on my shoulders. so, bras will be worn only when i'm feeling like it. 

when i went down to breakfast with my book, i saw rhiannon from watertown. she was with the more obnoxious boy who was flirting with me dismally from orientation. while she gave no recognition to my presence--i'm not sure she actually saw me--he seemed flustered. weirdo. i ignored him and got my breakfast and found a place in the sun to read. i didn't mind eating alone.

i feel better about the whole friendless situation. i realized that lots of people are in the same position as i right now, and talking about it with them is a damn good icebreaker--""hey, i'm a friendless loser--how about you?"" it's worked for me already. aside from that, i realized that things will happen whether i go out of my way to make friends or not. i'm getting a job, i'm starting classes--people will be surrounding me, and i'm bound to connect with at least one of them. i don't have to like put up want ads for friends...they will happen. even if i don't party this first week. i'm ok with spending this week to get adjusted and saving the partying for later on. i mean, it's not like i've never partied and am itching to puke my brains out as soon as possible. i've partied quite a bit, and it can wait. i'm just really not a proactive person when it comes to making friends. now, in this case i am going to make a bit more of an effort to make friends--like complimenting that chick on her earrings, for example. if i see her again i'll ask if she wants to hang out. from what i've gathered from observing her she's relatively friendless and probably feels out of place...she came to the meeting with a bunch of glitterfied over-made-up bleached out tanned party girls who are obviously her suite-mates, an uncomfortable look on her face. haha. i know that look all too well. but that kind of thing makes me feel better, and more comfortable. i'm not the only friendless person and people aren't going to kill me if i strike up a convo with them, because they're just as uncomfortable as i. i'm still going to join the clubs, though...speeding up the process of making friends is a good idea. also, a girl with similar interests i met on facebook messaged me and asked if i wanted to hang out, and i messaged her back and said i was a friendless loser and i'd love to, and she messaged me back and said she was a friendless loser too and was glad to know there were others out there. haha. so we should be hanging out soon, probably tomorrow.

i'm really looking forward to classes. mine seem so interesting, i can't wait. i got an email from my lesbian lit prof asking whether i wanted her to order my first book from broad vocabulary, the feminist bookstore in bayview...she said she wants to support their business and made a deal with them for our particular class. so that's pretty cool--i dunno if i should accept or decline this one. i'm still broke, but i'd like to support broad vocabulary. i suppose we'll have to see.

i've been feeling slightly unfulfilled lately. like, i feel like i need to meditate or something. at least take some time to ponder worthwile things...actually <i>think</i>. maybe it's just all the transition crap and people overwhelming me, but i could use some time just for my mind to wander. i'm having trouble keeping my train of thought. so i think after i walk around campus a bit i might go down to the lakefront. i kinda want some good reading time--i'm still reading <i>portrait of the artist</i>, but it's such a hard book to follow, it really requires utmost concentration. something i've been lacking. and it's starting to get good, so i want to devote some time to that. but i guess we'll just see.

heidi and i are hanging out again. i don't want to hold my breath, but <i>harold and maude</i> MIGHT be watched finally tonight. it would be incredible if we got through that movie without interruption.

i've been feeling especially cuntlovin lately, i'm guessing because of virgo. i'm feeling that solidarity toward women that inga muscio called for in one of the chapters of cunt, surprisingly. i just find it surprising because it's so easy for me to be annoyed with girls--the dumb hairspray kind. but towards even them i'm feeling a solidarity. i'm glad. women are way cool. pat yourself on the back if you're a chick. and if you're a guy who respects chicks, go ahead and pat yourself on the back, too. 

living in milwaukee is such a peculiar experience. i already feel myself changing, though i can't put a finger on where. it's this huge transition, it's discombobulated me. but i love milwaukee more than ever, and i especially love the breathtaking view of the lake from my window on the 23rd floor. it's wonderful.

hipsters are annoying.

being in milwaukee makes me miss ann and justin. :( wish they were here."

"event","well, this song is like, my new favorite. i've been craving bjork lately...so perfectly lovely and wonderful. 

so, i promised myself that my journal would get happier. i looked back at my latest 20 entries and almost all of them have at least some negative element about them. of course, it <i>is</i> my journal, and i take full liberty to write whatever i damn well please whenever i damn well please, and it's not up to me whether you read it or not. however, i like being happy, i usually <i>am</i> happy, and i like writing about happy things. i feel bad, i don't want to be a negative person. i'm somewhat of a cynic, but i am a generally happy person. i like life. so i will reflect that in my journal from now on, i promise. and bjork will help. she makes me happy.

last night was really fun. after i got kicked out of the computer lab i went up to my room and found that i was alone. <i>alone</i>. alone time is not something to be squandered in my sort of environment...when tara moves in i can wager that i'll have virtually no alone time in that room. so i decided to cherish it a bit. i put on some death in june, turned off the light, and used only my salt rock lamp for light, which emits a beautiful golden glow, not really a light. i organized my excess stuff on my desk and in my backpack. i didn't have much along time, because erin came in soon after, but it was enough, and it was theraputic. luckily, heidi called soon after and said she was on her way over with jasmine and kristen, and asked if i wanted to go to pizza shuttle. i said, yes, of course, and told her i'd be down in a minute. so i washed my face, threw some things into my bag, and went downstairs. i could see heidi standing in the middle of a mass of freshman milling around in the entrance hall in a green collared shirt and her new perfectly heidi glasses, and smiled. she was staring around, somewhere vaguely above everyone else's head, her hands in her pockets,  shifting back and forth between either foot, an mildly pained expression on her face. haha. but then she saw me and smiled, and we hugged, and she looked at my franken-neck, and it was good. it's so <i>good</i> to live in the same city as her. anyways, we went to pizza shuttle, had ice cream, and had some good laughs. i was absolutely fascinated by how well heidi's glasses represent her. they've become her. it's like they're this external body part that she's been missing all her life and finally found. i mean, every idiosyncracy, behavior, everything she says or does is magnified and enhanced and her heidi-ness is magnified x 10,000 when she's wearing those glasses. lol. they're so absolutely perfect it's almost scary. i enjoyed observing that very much indeed. 

so anyways, after pizza shuttled, jazmine and kristen dropped heidi and i off at heidi's. i had to first call mom because she'd asked me to, so i did that and she of course talked my ear off. but i felt bad, because she said that the moment she drove away, she started bawling, and when she got home, she turned on every light in the house and blasted the TV just so she wouldn't feel so alone. *sigh* it really sucks for her, i know, but i really think she'll grow and change for the better. maybe she'll even begin to like it. but i still feel bad. luckily she's back to work today, and she's coming for the weekend since it's labor day, so that will ease the loneliness, i hope. but after i got off the phone with mom, heidi and i popped some wine (with much difficulty) and together drank the entire bottle. haha. by the time i went to sleep i was admittedly pretty drunk...i drank my half and most of heidi's as well, in my defense. but it was fun. we watched an episode or two of ""twin peaks"" (really funny/weird sitcom thing by david lynch from the early 90s), and then she of course fell asleep while i put on ""kirikou and the sorceress"" this really realy sweet animated african film...it's one of those films that are technically for children, but teach really good lessons and are good for adults to watch as well. so i enjoyed that very much. and then i fell asleep.

this morning heidi and i woke up around 9, i think, and watched another episode of twin peaks, then she had to leave for work. when she left i watched a few more episodes while tidying up her apartment. now, my organizational habits have been almost debilitatingly obsessive lately. i've been super organized and feel like i can't stop myself from organizing stupid things like safety pins all the time. i think it's virgo's influence on me...but it's a good thing that virgo is now, at the beginning of the school year, because at least i can use my crazy organizational habits to help with school. hehe. but i digress. after i finished cleaning up her house (resisted with some difficulty cleaning her room), i went outside on her balcony to finger paint. <i>ahhhh.</i> what a refreshing activity. i felt so happy afterward. i had in mind painting the way sunlight comes through trees, and it ended up looking like that very abstractly, but very childlike on the whole. i absolutely LOVED finger painting. it was just so fun, and so relaxing. sitting outside in the sun and the breeze with trees dancing above me, my fingers covered in a tangible rainbow, smearing it around the paper and seeing what comes out. absolutely lovely. i highly recommend this activity. i think heidi and i should do it tonight again...i want to just paint, now, and not paint anything. i mean, my painting doesn't really look like what i intended it to look like, but still. now i want to paint without intending it to look like anything. and i want to do it with someone. i still can't get over the fact that i can just come over to heidi's any given day and hang out and do this. so great. 

but anyways. bertrand came home amidst my painting and i about jumped out of my skin when he said ""hello there"" or something. haha. but i finished my painting and washed my hands as best i could, then came in here to utilize the joys of a personal computer. so that's been my day.

and now i will finish talking about my room. basically, i love my space. i compacted my clothes as much as possible, putting as many as 6 or 7 shirts on a hanger so i don't hog the closet space, and using only 2 1/2 dressers. mom got me a rice paper chinese wall hanging with a pretty picture and the symbol for ""happiness"", and it's beautiful. i hung it in the space between my bed and desk, near my salt lamp. very calming. i feel organized but comfortable. it already feels like home. it's going to get insane, but i seriously doubt i'll be in my room constantly. which is good. things will work out. 

anyways, i am slightly concerned about making friends at this point. my roommates are cool, but it's highly unlikely we'd ever be <i>friends</i>, you know? i think they'd probably just end up being afriad of me. which is cool, i just want to make sure i make <i>some</i> friends. i don't mind being a hermit 99% of the time, but that 1% is there, too, and because of that i need friends. as perfectly as i get along with heidi, i refuse to be that loser who goes to college and doesn't meet anyone but hangs out with her sister all the time. haha. i will force myself to make friends if it's the last thing i do. but it's really, really hard. i'm so exasperated with the whole going door-to-door and introducing yourself kind of thing. and i can't latch on to one of my roommates and befriend their friends and go from there, because they're just not like that. tehl is nice, but we're different, and she's already got a bunch of friends . and erin is really cool and i know we'll get along well, but she already has a bunch of friends, so she's not into making more, i guess. whatever, it would suck to be best friends with your roommates, as heidi said. but that still leaves me with a problem. i'm okay with eating alone--i've got books--but i do want to go out at night. i mean, this is the historical first week of college for me--it should be filled with parties. i'd really like to find some, and some cool people. i've decided to join some clubs in the hopes that i'll find people there of common interest. so...SSDP, veggie club...? suggestions from those who've been there *cough*ann*cough*? i need wisdom. and any other suggestions as to how to meet people? aside from getting off my lazy ass and performing the dreaded getting to know you rituals? will orientation help me? *sigh* i wish i didn't want friends, it'd be so much easier. but the prospect of going through my first year and not partying or going out at all or meeting people who aren't wastes of flesh is far too depressing to even think about. it's painful, but i'll do my best. PLEASE give me some advice on this matter. i'm fully pathetic, i know that, it's totally ok. haha. 

alright, well, i really need to do something with myself. i'm going to walk back to my dorm, shower and change, possibly, then walk to the union to see about that job and get my bus pass, and then eat. and damn, i have to call my mom. 

orientation is tomorrow, oh joy. woops. staying positive!"

"event","well, folks, this is my very first post as a resident to this fine city of milwaukee. how does it feel, you ask? well, pretty damn good, i'd say. 

today was absolute insanity. mom and i had packed up the car last night so we could save time in the morning and not have to wake up early (my move in time was set for 12:30, which meant we'd have to leave by about 11:30). the packing passed with little incident, except when mom broked down and started crying. but i hugged her and she calmed down and it was fine. we fit everything in nicely and were very organized, and in the end we were pretty pleased with ourselves, i must say. hehe. 

well, we'd packed the car the night before so we wouldn't have to wake up early and do it, but that didn't stop my brain from waking me up at 8 am and telling me to take my levothyroxin (i have to take it at the same time each day on an empty stomach, and mornings an hour before breakfast is the easiest time). i got up, freezing and groggy, took my meds, and went back to bed. and lay there. for 2 hours. at 10 i finally gave up and got up, ate breakfast, took the rest of my meds, and showered. my bedroom is completely empty, it's really crazy. i took one last venture around the house after i'd finished getting ready, said goodbye to it, and then mom and i set off for the road. she had to stop at the bank, and then refused to go above 60 on the interstate (if you've got a big carload you're supposed to stay under 60 to save on gas), so we ended up arriving a bit late--we got here around 11:45. i hopped out immediately and ran into the dorms to check in...got my room key and a bunch of info while mom parked. when i went into the parking garage, thankfully i saw that mom had parked right in front of where i was, so i didn't have to search for her or anything. i went and got two luggage carts, and we piled them high and fit everything on them, including my purse and backpack. there were staff walking around helping people out, and when we'd loaded our carts someone came with this ginormous industrial sized roll of really sticky plastic wrap--it was seriously three feet wide. she just wrapped our cart up with plastic wrap so nothing would fall (it was crazy strong), and we got in the line for the elevators. it was <i>huge</i>. luckily, after we'd waited for a few minutes, someone came and asked if there were any people on the odd-numbered floors. there weren't many, but my floor is 23, so i followed them and got to go up to my floor right away. which was very cool. once up there, i met my roommate tehl. she's really nice, i definitely like her. while she's not someone i could ever become real friends with, she's at least easy to talk to and not annoying. she likes partying, so we have at least one thing in common. lol. so anyways, mom and i unloaded the carts at record speed and began the long and arduous process of organizing. tehl had the rooms set up really well, so we're keeping them how they are. it'd be too hard to try to rearrange everything. in one of our rooms, all four of us girls are sleeping--one is a bunk bed and the other a loft with a bed underneath it. they're on either side of the room. there are two desks with shelves in the middle of the room facing eachother (but divided by the shelves). on the opposite wall is the clothing area thing (it's weird) with some dresser thingies (i have no idea how to describe them, so i wont try) and some metal wracks to hang hangers and store clothes on the wracks. like closets with compartments. in the other room, tehl has a futon set up facing the TV (with dvd), a mini-fridge, and there's another dresser-storage thingy, and the third desk. now, they accomodated the bed part of our rooms for four people, but nothing else. we only have three desks and three dresser-storage thingies. erin moved in about an hour after i did, but the new tara (pronounced TAHra, apparently) won't be in for a few days. so this is going to be very interesting. at the moment, tehl is taking the lofted bed and the dresser/storage thingy across from it in the sleeping room (that's what we'll call the room with the beds, though that's where i'll probably be spending all my time). she took up most of the dresser-storage space, but said that we can shove her stuff aside if we need it and said that if things don't work she can condense her things a bit more. i took the bottom bunk and half the opposite dresser-storage thing. 

damn, apparently they're closing this up at 8...in 4 minutes. i thought it was open till 12 am (that's what the door says). oh well, i suppose i'll have to finish this tomorrow. heidi should be here in an hour! sayonara from my first night in mke! :)"

"event","well, folks...<i>this is it</i>. the moment i've been waiting for for...i'd say about eight years. not my whole life, but almost half of it. haha. ok, nevermind.

the point i'm trying to make is, at this time tomorrow i will be officially moved-out and ""on my own."" first things first. 

i'll be leaving tomorrow by around 11 am. my address and phone number are:

<b>3400 North Maryland Ave. box 2007
Milwaukee, WI 53211</b>

and 

<b>414-229-7957</b>

my emails will be remaining the same, plus my uwm one:

<b>bohemiak@hotmail.com</b>

and 

<b>kpennell@uwm.edu</b>

you'll reach me by either one, but probably by my hotmail account faster. 

my room number is:

<b>Sandburg Hall room N2340A</b>.

if i haven't had a chance to see you before tomorrow, i'm very sorry, but i'll still be on eljay, so cyber-communication will remain between us, most definitely. i hope your first semester (wherever you are) or fall months go well. please, if you've borrowed something from me (i have siddhartha in mind but i can't recall who has it), <i>return it to my mother</i>. she'll still be at the high school, and i'd really appreciate this. books are quite precious to me.

classes start september 6. oh, i can't believe i forgot to post this!! the other day, when i was in surgery, someone called from employment at uwm. i called them back, and i have to stop in tomorrow to talk with them--it's from food service. she said they're still looking for a lot of people to hire. so it's very likely that i'll have a job! i was so excited. 

as for my health, i'm feeling so much better it's incredible. higher energy, less tingling, and my incision continues to heal very speedily. it's itching like crazy, which is a good sign. 

as for my pre-adjusting worries, i'm also doing well. i feel a little more prepared now that i'm feeling better. i <i>am</i> admittedly apprehensive, but who wouldn't be? i'm mostly worried for mom...i know she's going to have a really hard time. it's a bummer that she has to work on tuesday, we could've hung out more or something. ease the separation anxiety. but we've spent lots of time together this summer, and lord knows she'll be in milwaukee a lot for my health issues. it's good that she's starting back to work right away, as well. would've been bad if she'd had too much time alone in this house. but above all, i'm excited. and prepared as i'll ever be. i'm glad i'll have a while before classes start to get adjusted. and i can't wait to see heidi, of course. it's definitely time to take this plunge.

well, i've got to finish last-minute organizing. my next update will be from uwm, at the beginning of a new chapter of my life. *sigh* i like how that sounds. :)"

"event","well, we called the on-staff doc at uwh just to see what their opinion on my matter would be. he said that if i was worried, i could go up to the ER and make sure everything was okay, but he said that it was really my call...if i was feeling very uncomfortable definitely go up, but if i was doing okay, i could relax. he said that all of this is probably just recovery...as we all know i'm majorly slow in recovering from anything. he said in his opinion i would be just fine to move in on monday, so tentatively (depending on dr. mack's opinion when he calls on monday) things are good to go for that.

tomorrow i'm going to spend the day buying the last minute details (shampoo, detergent, etc) and loading up the car and just getting everything situated. maybe doing something hands on--some busy work--will help me feel a little more prepared for the transition. but i am feeling better, thankfully. 

i can't believe i'm moving out in <i>one day</i>.

"event","my incision is healing nicely. it's itchy as hell, but it looks much better, and the range of motion in my neck is increasing daily. i'm feeling more and more like a normal person each day. 

however, i'm still incredibly tired, i'm still tingling quite a lot, my neck is still very sore, and i still have occasional bouts of nausea. my appetite's not quite back, but it's coming. yesterday i had bloodwork done, and today dr. marden called with the results. whaddya know? my calcium level's back down to 7.6. fucking sweet. 

so things are complicated. mom is talked about me moving in to my dorm on monday, but then coming home and not staying overnight, because i may need to go back to uw-hospital. this really is not good, i have to say. it's really bad that we had to cut surgery so close to moving in. i can't even believe it--i'm moving in in a day and a half. i'm nowhere near being mentally prepared. i can't even grasp the concept. i'm not enjoying being in this position, and i've been in relatively low spirits. i don't really know what it is...last night i was overcome with a very depressive sort of emotion that i can't pinpoint. i was lonely and exhausted and depressed. my thoughts are racing. i suppose this is the aftermath of surgery and the beginning of a huge transition, but i'm just so tired. it's hard to deal with everything right now when all i want to do is give my body adequate time to heal and recover. this is really no fun at all.

i really have no idea what's going to happen. since it's a weekend, i won't know till monday morning, which is cutting it as close as you possibly can, since i'm moving <i>out</i> at 11 am. fucking ridiculous. i suppose worst-case scenario would be hypo-calcium and hypo-thyroid for the rest of my life and would need to be on calcium and thyroid supplements for the rest of my life. sounds like a grand old time. *sigh* 

i suppose i'll go lay down. again."

"event","so, where i left off, i'd just been wheeled into my personal hospital room. throughout the rest of the night my memories are still splotchy...mom said i wasn't quite pulled out of the anesthetics yet so i slept a lot on and off. when i really woke up for the first time, i asked mom how the surgery had gone. she said that when doctor mack talked to her, he told her the surgery went well, that it took a little longer than expected (about 3 hours), and that it was a very bloody surgery because of all the blood vessels connected with the thyroid. hehe. he said that the thyroid weight about 110 grams--about equivalent to a stick of butter. haha. unfortunately, i believe dr. mack & co. kept the thyroid for study purposes, so i don't think i'll be pickling it and feeding it to anyone. sorry. could've made a nice stew.

anyways, i was on darvoset, which i've been told is the strongest narcotic available. narcotics, as i've said, do not do good things to katie. i was unbelievable nauseated. they asked me to try to eat some jello, said maybe i just needed something in my stomach. i tried, got about a teaspoon in and wanted to vomit more than ever. i was terrified of throwing up, though (i couldn't even move my neck--i had a mental image of my incision ripping open with the force of vomitting), and concentrated every fiber of my being into keeping my stomach in control. the nurses gave me some anti-nausea medicine through my IV, and soon i felt slightly better. they then gave me some vicodin, among other various drugs--i really have no idea at that point of what exactly was polluting my veins. soon again i was beyond nauseated. my neck felt as if it was in a vice grip, my throat was on fire, my stomach was raging in nausea, and every square inch of my body felt like it was being stabbed repeatedly by nails--of course, when speaking of my left inner elbow, this was true. nurses were coming every hour to draw more blood, and always in the same place. over my entire hospital visit, i'd estimate that they took my blood at least 19 times--at two vials per lab, that's 38 vials of blood. i'm not exaggerating. my arm is black and blue and yellow and is still killing me, probably more than my incision. toward the end of my stay i almost cried whenever another lab specialist knocked on my door and said, ""just gotta take some more blood"". it was horrible. now, i'm no stranger to having blood taken--i had it taken about twice a month during the entire grave's experience. it doesn't hurt me, and it doesn't gross me out. but by the time i left the hospital, i could feel that godforsaken needle sliding in and out of my skin, could feel the blood being squeezed from my arm (thanks to my clenched fist--in the end i actually had to pump the blood out), and it hurt more than anything i can describe. the hole they were drawing blood from didn't heal for a long time--i'd have to put pressure on it continually for 5 minutes or the blood would soak through the gauze. when the lab specialists came in at night, they'd stop in, say, ""just gotta take some blood,"" and i'd mumble, ""ok,"" hold out my arm, and fall back asleep. ridiculous. 

but back to that first night. yeah. so, pretty much i was in more pain than i've ever experienced and wanted to die. i couldn't talk--my voice was nothing more than a hoarse whisper, so it was nearly impossible to tell the nurses of my problems. by around 2 am, my hands were crippled in a praying-mantis position, my lips and face muscles were paralyzed in tension, my leg muscles were cramped and paralyzed (charlie horse style), and my entire body was wracked with pins and needles so intense i felt as if i were on fire. not to mention the nausea and pain. eventually the nurses had the resident doctor come in (dr. mack was still in surgery), and he recognized a severe defficiency of calcium. checked my labs and said, yes, my calcium was at about a 7.0, when it should have been at an 8.7-10.0, or something. mom asked him what that meant, he explained that my parathyroid glands had been disturbed during surgery, and because of their hyper-sensitivity, they were screwing with my calcium levels majorly. turns out that the parathyroids were under the impression that i was severely osteoporosised and they were draining every ounce of calcium from my blood and into my bones. he flicked lightly at the facial nerve in my face, and apparently my lips and eyes twitched. it's a test they do when this happens to people, i guess, but it's extremely rare for the test to work--i guess it's just kind of obscure for a doctor to see. so the doctor was all excited, and had his training-doctor team (who'd observed my surgery) come and look. i guess he'd never seen it before. haha. so that was all fine and good, but i was still pretty crippled, pretty naucious, and pretty in pain. mom asked him what potentially could happen if this calcium got any more out of control...i was out of it, like i said, and i heard him say a lot of things, but among them i heard the word ""seizure."" at that point i freaked out a bit. i'd just come out of major surgery, my insides were on fire, everything was dark and flashing at me, i had needles in my arms, my neck felt like it'd been partially severed, i could't move, my entire body was on fire with tingling, i was practically paralyzed, and i was locked in a little sterile cell in some unknown building surrounded by people i'd never seen before in my life who were giving me god-knows-what in god-knows-what quantity through a tube in my hand. things were terrifying, and i had a flash-back to my dystonic reaction to compazine. it was horrible. i think i was moaning, ""owie, owie, owie, owie..."" and sobbing. the nurses did the best they could, hooked me up to an ECG which i had to sleep with (yeah...they basically just took my top off and started sticking these pads all over my chest...so i was naked to the waist for all the world to see...i swear, every ounce of privacy deserts you in a hospital). eventually the narcotics did one thing right and i was asleep. it was very, very bad.

i was awoken a little while later, considerably more calm, by dr. mack popping his smiling face into the room. if i haven't mentioned it before, dr. mack is a very dumbledore-esque personality. which immediately put me at ease. he told me that during surgery one of the four parathyroids was embedded in my thyroid, so dr. mack had to remove it and put it in some muscle. that's why i was experiencing such extreme hypo-calium reactions. he said that it was the most common reaction to thyroid surgery, and that i shouldn't worry, that i was being cared for and they wouldn't let me go until they were sure i was fine. considerably less troubled, i fell asleep when he left.

i woke up the next day pretty early--around 5 am to be exact--and couldn't think what to do with myself. i was feeling better--still in pain, but my neck muscles felt worst because of the awkward position in which i had to hold my head and sleep. i stood up and went to the bathroom by myself. it was only a few steps to the bathroom, but still, this was a big accomplishment, because it was the first time i'd even stood up since surgery. i then washed my face as best i could (which wasn't very good), and laid back down. i couldn't fall asleep, and it was boring as hell. nurses popped in very often to take blood or give me tums (calcium supplements--three of them every 2 hours) or some other medication (i was only on motrin by then--the narcotics were doing bad things), and a young female doctor-in-training (who was apparently assigned to me) stopped in every so often to ask questions. also the resident doc and his team of training doctors stopped in often. not great fun. mom woke up with a migraine a few hours later and puked her brains out. i felt helpless and worn out and tired of the hospital. after mom puked she felt better, so when the nurses suggested we go on a walk, we accepted and went down to the surgical waiting area to get on the internet for a while. that was an odd experience...i put on another hospital gown so my butt wouldn't show, and i put on underwear and footies, but i was still hooked to this IV tree, hadn't showered, had dried blood in my hair, and had to walk in a stooped over position and take 3-inch long steps. i felt about 85 years old amongst a sea of normal, healthy people. haha. we then walked back upstairs to my room, and i dozed for a while more. the same things happened all day--nurses upon nurses doing different things to me, doctors coming in to tell me my calcium wasn't changing and that i'd need to stay another night at least, and blood being continuously drawn. i whiled away the hours watching the abhorred television and eating my first meal--ice cream, cranberry juice, and mashed potatos. hehe. i couldn't finish it all, but i didn't feel nauseated, so that was good. later on in the day, dr. mack came in, told me what everyone else had told me, made sure i was comfortable (he resituated my pillows, hehe), and got me more ice cream to push the calcium. aww. he was doing a nurse's job. it was really sweet--i definitely felt well cared for, at least. he told me i would in fact be staying another day. he told the nurse to hippo my IV, or something like that, and one of the nurses came in and started fiddling with it. before i knew what was happening, she'd disconnected the tube and blood was spurting from my hand like a river, covering my hand in blood and soaking my bedsheets. i stared horrified at my hand while she cheerily closed the IV back up, leaving the needle in my arm with the blue clip on the end and a short tube, but she taped down the tubing and didn't attach it to the IV bags. it was the most disgusting thing ever. mom and i decided to go for another walk, and went back to the computers for a while, then out onto the courtyard. it was much warmer than i'd expected it to be, but windy. we strolled around for a while more, then went back to my room and ordered food and watched more TV. heidi and justin & ann called later on, and that brightened my spirits. after a long, tiring while, later that night, mom and i fell asleep.

my sleep was punctured by visits from lab people, my arm growing increasingly more sore, but i slept in disjointed fragments until about 8 am, when i awoke with a start to see dr. mack smiling serenely at me from the foot of my bed, his hands behind his back. haha. it was funny. i said, ""oh, hi!"" but he put his finger to his lips and said, ""shh!"" and pointed to mom, who was still asleep. teehee. he told me that my calcium levels were upand we'd continue pumping the calcium and taking blood, and see how things went that day. i said ok, and he left the room. lol. i fell back asleep and woke up at around 11 again. mom woke up, and we ordered some breakfast and watched tv. the nurse came in and asked me if i wanted to shower. i quickly agreed--i hadn't showered since sunday night and felt really gross. the nurse supplied me with a number of towels and some shampoo, conditioner, and soap. she instructed me to keep the water from running directly on the incision (though it was ok to get it wet, just no soaking), and to pat dry when i was done. 

i took a long shower, washing myself very gingerly, and keeping my back to the shower head. i was dizzy and had to sit down (luckily there was a little seat in the shower), but all in all it was a success and i felt much cleaner afterward. i put on regular clothes, thankfully, had mom french braid my hair, and lay back down on the bed, quite exhausted and a bit nauseated. around 2 pm the nurse came in and they said my calcium levels were up to about 8.4 and i'd be able to leave. dr. mack came a little later and confirmed this, shook my hand and said goodbye, and set up an appointment to see me again september 8. a guy from pharmaceuticals came in and gave me the rundown on the meds i'd be on: levothyroxin, the thyroid supplement, tums, for calcium, motrin, for pain, propranalol, because i'd been on it for a long time and needed to be weaned off of it, and calcitrol, for vitamin D and calcium. eventually i'd only be on levothyroxin, but the rest i needed for various reasons for a while. 

so, around 3 pm or so, i was discharged. mom gathered our belongings and headed down to get the car and bring it around while a nurse situated me in a wheel chair and zoomed me out of the hospital and down to the entrance. she helped me sit on a bench to let me wait for mom and said goodbye. after waiting a while, i saw mom walking towards me. she said, ""guess what? we have a flat tire."" incredulous, i followed her back into the hospital and waited while she talked to security and called gmac. i got a wheelchair and she pushed me along with her to a patient services office, where they let her make long distance calls without charging. she made so many phone calls it was ridiculous. eventually, after about an hour, she'd made arrangements for her friend mrs. backhaus to deposit enough money into her account to pay for a new tire, for a tow truck to come to the hospital and tow it to a farm and fleet in madison, and for my friend ben to come pick us up. everything in place, mom and i went outside to wait. we waited for over an hour, and finally the tow truck showed up. mom drove the car reluctantly out of the garage and over to the truck (she had to drive on the rim because the clearance for the parking garage was too high for the truck), where the guy put the car on the ramp. soon after, ben showed up. we drove to farm & fleet and waited while the tire was changed--apparently a tiny nail was the cause of the flat. it's incredible, because mom hadn't moved the car since parking it in that very spot monday morning. so ridiculous. we repaired the tired and finally drove home. i was so exhausted. when i got home zillions of people called, and i talked for a short while, ate a little bit, and crashed. i was so incredibly tired, but it felt good to sleep on a normal bed. 

so concluded my long, arduous, hospital stay. some of the details may be jumbled--i'm still not clear on everything--but that's the jist of it. it was tough, but it's over. i think."

i'm leaving for bloodwork (yes, <i>again</i>) in 5 minutes, then mom and i are utilizing a movie pass we found and heading to towne cinema to see <i>the brothers grimm</i>. as we can't make the drive-in, this shall be our last hurrah.

after this, i plan on coming home and calling a-lo and beth. a-lo left a message on our answering machine while i was in madison inviting me to hit up his going-away party that's happening tonight. apparently he didn't know i was in surgery. i'm going to <i>try</i> to stop in for 30 minutes if someone can drive me there (hence the call i will make to beth).  but i can't stay any longer, and i'm not allowed to drive for another week and a half. so we'll have to see how that goes.

in other news, i was pleasantly surprised by a lovely card from ann and justin that arrived this morning. awwwww. it was really cute. thanks so much, guys :). and then some young chick arrived at the door with a coffee cup full of flowers and a balloon from mom. hehe. that was really cute, too. she really shouldn't have, but i really should've known she would. so i appreciated the outpouring of loveliness i again received this morning. thanks, everyone :)."

"event","<i>okay</i>. i read through my missed friends pages finally, so whether i commented or not, i definitely read your journals. so, feel loved. hehe. again, thanks so much, everyone, for all the support and good wishes i've received since monday. 

so, this is probably going to be a ridiculously idealistic attempt of mine, but i am henceforth going to try to post in chronological order the mixed memories and scattered mental notes i jotted down in my brain over the course of this surgical experience of mine. i'll probably end up doing this in installments depending what my health allows, because i want to be as detailed as possible and record everything i remember. but i'll just get down to it. please excuse the less than par rhetoric, typos, and scattered trains of thought...i'm kinda dizzy. 

my official preparation for surgery began a week before surgery. it wasn't really ""preparation""--all i had to do was abstain from alcohol, ibuprofen, aspirin, and blood-thinning drugs. tylenol was ok. so, that part wasn't tough. 

the friday before surgery (remember, it was scheduled for a monday), the RN who would be assissting my operation, called mom in the morning while i was still asleep. she went over the dos and don'ts, among which were--1)no eating after 12 am sunday night/monday morning, 2)eat a peanut butter & jelly sandwhich before midnight sunday night as the last thing in my stomach for protein, 3)shower the night before with a special surgical soap called hibiclens that they'd given me at my pre-op visit, scrubbing the incision site for two minutes, then repeating the process, and 4)surgery was scheduled for 7:30 am, but i'd have to be at the hospital at 5:30 am. eek! the last bit of news came as somewhat of a shock, since surgery had originally been scheduled for 11 am, but mom and i decided to deal with it, and leave the house at 4:30 am. 

the weekend flew by, and before i knew it it was sunday. mom and i woke up early and spent the day cleaning--a <i>lot</i>--so we could wear ourselves out and fall asleep early enough to get a full night's rest before waking up before dawn. kaitlyn stopped by to wish me luck before surgery. it was really sweet. i was very glad to see her. mom and i ate dinner, then began to pack our stuff up (preparing, mind you, for one overnight stay in the hospital). mom packed some food in an insulated tote for overnight because we couldn't afford to buy any. beth arrived later that evening to drop off a coffee for me from berres brothers and a few vintage national geographics she'd found at a rummage sale that she thought i'd enjoy (totally sweet--they're from the '60s!) and wish me luck for surgery. again, very sweet of her. after a brief bout of panic in which neither mom nor i could locate her wallet and mom began to freak out (i finally found it under a seat in the car), i ate my pb&j and showered. the soap was liquid and red. hehe. foreshadowing? i like to think so. after getting out of the shower, i double-checked that everything was in place, french-braided my hair, and hit the hay. it took forever for me to fall asleep, and when i finally did, i think i only dozed lightly. i felt like i'd just gotten into bed when the alarm went off at 4 am and i sat bolt upright, awake despite my lack of sleep. mom said she hadn't slept at all. we got dressed. i lovingly stroked my incision free (though bulging) neck which for the last time in my life would contain a thyroid (though, admittedly, diseased). i wish now that i'd enjoyed the freedom of a full range of motion in my neck a little bit more, but i digress. at 4:30 mom and i stepped into night (i felt like a bandit) and drove off toward madison, stopping first for gas. i was completely relaxed, exited, and aware of my surroundings. i was making furious mental notes already, wanting to remember the experience when all was said and done. i remember gazing up into the pre-dawn sky and seeing only one little star (or planet) flickering feebly in the west, but accompanying us faithfully all the way to madison. we made our destination before the sun had risen above the horizon. drove into the parking garage and found that the <i>third space</i> was unoccupied--one upside of having monday morning surgery scheduled. entered the hospital entrance of uw-hospital and made our way to the ""D"" section and up to floor 6, then checked in. before i could fully prepare myself, mom was guided to a waiting area and i was whisked away to a room where i was provided with a hospital gown (how i grew to hate that thing), a robe, footies, and a hat, and was told to take off every ounce of clothing/jewelry/shoes and store them in some plastic bags which were provided. i was then told to wait in the room until people came in. after staring at the blank wall for a half an hour, listening to the sounds of my neighboring victims before the slaughter, i shuffled feebly out to the nurse's desk and asked if i could give my glasses to my mom (she had my glasses case). the nurse gave me the okay, and i went into the surgical waiting area, feeling beyond moronic in my surgical garb among normal looking people. hehe. i gave mom my glasses and retrieved my book so i could do something while waiting for something to happen. i went back to my room and reclined uncomfortably on the bed i would also grow to hate within the next few days. i read until one of the nurses came in to ask me questions, make me sign forms, fill out a survey, talk to me about the surgery and sign some more forms. then she allowed mom to come in. soon i was visited by anesthesia--a nice woman who complimented me on my hair and shoved a needle into the top of my right hand without wincing. she didn't hook me up to an IV tree yet, though. following her visit, a male nurse (a relatively good looking one, at that--sort of reminded me in an abstract way of heidi's friend curt) came in and introduced himself, told me he'd be assissting in the surgery, and asked if dr. mack had stopped by. i told him he hadn't, and he said that after dr. mack came in they'd wheel me out. after the nurse came the female anesthesiologist again and her assisstant, who (as she put it) would be the one i could thank since he'd be giving me the drugs. hehe. he was very funny and i felt quite relaxed. finally dr. mack came in, bright and cheery and looking very endearing in his scrubs, hat, and mask, and began quipping in his german accent, smiling, and laughing. he remarked on my calm appearance and assured mom that i would be perfectly fine. at 7 am the male nurse came back, along with the two anesthesiologists, and told me it was time. my palms sweating slightly, i hugged mom (she was more nervous than i, i could tell), laid back on the bed and attempted to relax as the team wheeled me out into the brightness and publicity of the hall outside. i was wheeled into a veritable sea of people, all in either white smocks or scrubs, all looking at me calculatingly. it didn't occur to me until after the surgery that they'd all be either assissting in or observing my surgery. in fact, i realized later, that my surgery had been video taped and would be used as a case study (i'd signed papers to give my consent to this). i felt like a bug under a microscope, but still wasn't wholly nervous. i was wheeled into a room, followed by my medical posse, where i was finally hooked up to the IV. i think they must have started me off on something milder, probably vallium, because i can remember only dimly the next few minutes. i remember them hooking up my IV, taking my vitals, transferring me to the operating table, and being asked to breathe into a plastic mask that was placed on my face. but the very last thing i remember was the feeling of that mask on my face, because i was unconscious within seconds. 

now, when i had oral surgery, i <i>was</i> completely unconscious, but i still have one very vague memory from the midst of the surgery. i remembering hearing a faint voice floating across my unconscious, a voice which said gently, ""okay, now just open your mouth a little bit wider."" a vision of white scrubs, a bright light, and surgeons hovering overhead flickered into view as i effortlessly opened my mouth wider, and as the same voice said soothingly, ""<i>gooooood</i>."" haha. very ""lucy in the sky with diamonds"". but that's all i remember. 

with <i>this</i> surgery, i remember nothing. over the span of the 3 1/2 hours it took in surgery, i have nothing but a blank space in my memory. the next very very dim and vague memory i have is of lying in my hospital bed, unable to move, oxygen tubes in my nose, a large quantity of gauze and bandages on my neck, a blood pressure cuff on my arm which inflated and deflated regularly at 10-minute intervals, an ECG monitor strapped heavily onto my chest, a pulse clip on my finger, an IV hooked up to my arm, elastic stockings encasing my legs, and huge calf-length blood pressure cuffs encasing my legs, deflating and inflating continuously in patterns to keep the blood flowing in my legs. i felt as if i were in a full-body cast--and i may well have been, for i had no desire to move and probably couldn't have if i'd wanted to. i faded in and out of consciousness, catching vague glimpses of my surroundings before falling out of consciousness again. a faceless motherly nurse hovered gently over me, feeding me ice chips in my dehydration and attending to my various other needs. she seemed to me an angel...she kept me comfortable and soothed me in my vague confusion, always hovering overhead, watching me, and treating my beaten body with incredible gentleness and care. i wanted to thank her, but my throat was completely enclosed and when i tried to make a sound, nothing escaped my mouth but air. she seemed to understand, however, and continued in her care. as i began to gain more consciousness, i became aware of my surroundings faintly. i was in a huge, white room which was lined with beds and recovering patients like myself, all of which were being hovered over and attended to by hordes of nurses like mine. i think my head was in some sort of encasement, because i could barely move it a centimeter, but my peripheral vision saw a man lying next to me, conscious, his leg in a large cast, being fed ice chips by a nurse. the room was about half the size of a gym, and lined with patients like me. must have been at least 15 of us. i got the vague impression that i and my recovering neighbors were fetal infants, completely helpless in the hands of our angelic nurses. i kind of felt the way l'engle describes meg's experiences at the hands of aunt beast in the end of ""a wrinkle in time"". haha. it was probably the most peculiar sensation i've ever experienced. i was trying to describe it to justin later on the phone, and the analogy he equated it to was that i and the other recovering patients were victims of war in a war hospital. haha. that's also another good analogy--perfectly representative. again, very very very weird experience. obviously, if you haven't gathered, i was in the recovery room--where patients go when they're recovering from surgery. it turns out that i was in there for another 3 1/2 hours--most of which i was unconscious. the reason for the length of my time in there was apparently because the hospital was overloaded and they needed to wait for patients to leave before i could get into my room. i didn't mind, obviously...all my needs were being attended to. i think there must have been a cathetor in me, as well, because i never needed to go to the bathroom. it was like a worry-free dream. i had absolutely nothing to worry about. definitely love it. 

finally, after 7 hours, a room was freed up and i was wheeled up to my room and <i>finally</i> saw mom. i went into my room, and i think i must have slept some more, because i don't remember much until it was later and darker.

ok, well, i'm beginning to get really woozy, so i'm going to get off. i'll continue my account tomorrow. :)"

"event","aww. you guys are all totally sweet. i'm not going to comment back to your comments or comment on your journal entries yet since i've only got a half-hour on here, but seriously, it's all really sweet of you. thanks to everyone who sent me well-wishes or whatever. hehe. you've been making me laugh (even though it hurts), so thank you :D. 

i finally ate for the first time since sunday when i got off the internet before. i couldn't eat much, but it was satisfying. i ordered a huge meal and shared it with mom since her food supply was only to last her 1 1/2 days...it's been working well. then i slept for 3 more hours, had 3 more vials of blood taken, took some more tums, motrin, and these huge potassium pills that i choked on. then dr. mack came in and was sweet as usual. i'm seriously in love with that man...he's fricking awesome. yay for kickass old men surgeons.

anyways, dr. mack took off the wrappings from my incision. it looks really good--it's healing fast, and i'm happy. i do look rather strikingly like frankenstein, but i kinda like that. too bad they didn't put steel bolts on the sides of my neck. anyways, i'm really enjoying the prospect of what a conversation starter this scar will be in college. i can say, ""so, guess what. last week some dude slit my throat and i survived."" hehe. it's about a finger up from my collar bone, 2 1/2 to 3 inches (incredibly small, considering the hugeness of the thyroid...dr. mack has been calling it a baby that he delivered--hehe). i'm really sorry i wasn't able to save and pickle my thyroid...i'm sure we all would have had a nice feast off of it. perhaps i can save a few gallons of the blood that came out of my body these past few days and we can at least toast those and drink them. :D i've got dried blood in my hair. it's pretty gross, i can't wait till they allow me to shower (maybe tomorrow). also, since they've taken my blood about 9 times now, my left arm rivals that of a herion addict. oh yeah. today they changed my IV and it was pretty much the most digusting thing i've ever experienced. well, they didn't take the needle out of my hand, but the took the tubing off and i swear to god a liter of blood came spilling out, all over my hand and my blanket. now, i've been exposed to blood a hell of a lot of times (god only knows how many times i've had needles stuck in my veins--millions) and i'm well beyond the point of feeling queasy at the sight of it, but when they changed my IV i just wanted to vomit all over. yuck, yuck, yuck. the sensation of warm blood spilling right from you veins all over your hand is really not pleasant at all. i was so grossed out.

generally i'm feeling ok--i've developed a bit of a cough (dr. mack said just because of the irritation from the incision) and it really really hurts when i cough because of the pressure, but aside from that, things are ok. i haven't been on narcotics since last night--they really make me sick. hehe, dr. mack calls them narcotic poison. lol. but i don't think i mix well with them at all, for whatever reason. so i've been on IV calcium, tums, potassium, and motrin, and i'm really doing fine. i'm glad i don't have to be too over-drugged. it's surprising to me that i'm doing fine pain-wise with only tylenol in my system--when i had oral surgery i was on vicodin and ibuprofen and i could barely stand the pain. so i'm glad.

anyways, mom and i are on our evening stroll right now, checking our email and the such. i think from here we'll go out to the courtyard for a bit and then get some dinner...my appetite is steadily coming back and i'm starting to get hungry. i'm really bored, i'll be glad to get a phone call or two tonight :). i may or may not be on again tonight, i suppose we'll see. my schedule's pretty full, what with all the blood leaving my veins every hour or so. haha. oh--<b>if you're going to call, mom wanted me to ask you to do it after 9 pm, because she wants to watch gilmore girls tonight.</b> hehe. she barfed quite a bit this morning (had a migraine) but she's feeling better. 

anyways, i'm tentatively leaving for home sometime tomorrow (probably late afternoon) if my calcium levels continue to go up. things are looking bright, so hopefully you'll here from me tomorrow at home! again, thanks so much for the well-wishes, it really means a lot. i'm bored as hell, it's nice to have a good laugh. aright well, talk to you all soon again! <3"

"event","well, guess what folks. i'm currently sitting in the uw-hospital surgical area on this computer, adorned in a hospital gown, attached to a huge IV tree through my hand, with a great bloody gash in my neck and multiple stitches. i'm not going to go into details now, but i just wanted to let you all know that i'll be here for at least one more night because of complications due to my parathyroid glands (they regulate calcium). heidi called this morning and i told her a bit more, so if you really want to know, talk to her. otherwise i <i>should</i> be home on wednesday sometime, but i can't make any promises. 

but i'm ok, no worries. i went into surgery around 8 am. it took about 4 hours i believe. dr. mack said it was very bloody. hehe. he also said that my thyroid weight 110 grams (normal is about 30 grams). haha. the reason i'm having complications is because there are four tiny parathyroid glands that surround the thyroid, and if they're even bumped they can go out of whack--they're hugely sensitive. one of my parathyroid glands was embedded in my thyroid, so dr. mack had to remove it and embed it in my neck muscle. the other three are fine, but it'll take a while to get this fourth one regulated. until then i'm hypo-calcium, so they're feeding calcium to me through an IV and tums. i'm getting blood drawn every two hours. last night, as a result of this low-calcium stuff, i was hugely naucious, and my hands, legs, arms, chin, neck cheeks, and lips were numb and tingly. also, when some resident doctors came in late that night, they did this test by tapping on my facial nerve. apparently sometimes when a patient is hypo-calcium their eyes and mouth twitch when the nerve is tapped, and mine did. the doctor was really surprised and excited at seeing this, apparently because it's really rare and he nor anyone else he knew had ever seen it. hehe. so i was their learning experience last night. also, a bunch of training doctors have been popping in every so often. it's kind of intimidating...this huge horde of grad students popping out of nowhere to talk to me when i can barely talk and am wearing nothing more than a hospital gown that opens at the back. haha. i'm not enjoying the sensation of being almost naked in a public place, that's for sure.

anyways, i've been popping tums regularly, getting calcium dripped into my IV, blood taken every two hours (i think my arm is more bruised than my neck, honestly), and when necessary, anti-nausea meds in my IV. also i had to sleep with an ECG, very unpleasant. i've been on vicodin and some other narcotic (i forgot the name, starts with a ""d""), but they've made me really naucious and i don't like it much, so i've pretty much been sticking with immotrin and dealing with the uncomfort. i've been in bed since yesterday 6 am and i'm pretty tired of it, so i'm on a walk right now with mom. she's got a headache, i feel bad. 

anyways, i'm hanging in here. i'm in much better spirits than yesterday--i started freaking out last night because of the whole hospital atmosphere and so many drugs, i think, but i'm feeling better now. hopefully i'll be home by wednesday, and you can talk to me then. you can call my hospital room, but i forgot the number, so if you want to, comment on estergrenwod's journal for the number. can't guarantee that i'll be around or awake, so you may just be better off waiting till i get home. but that's up to you.

well, my half hour is almost up on here and i think i'll try to eat something for the first time (i tried jello but couldn't hold it down). anyways, hope everything's ok with everyone else. hopefully i'll talk to you all soon. :)"

"event","well, i can't talk much now, because mom is going absolutely postal with stress and in a minute i have to shower, eat a pb&j sandwich, chug as much water as is humanly possible (i'm going for 2 liters...that's what i drank the other day) until fasting time sets in, and go to bed. to reiterate one last time...

<b>i will be leaving the house at 4:30 am to arrive at uw-hospital at 5:30. from there i will register in the first day surgery ward, and meet with an anesthesiologist. surgery is scheduled for 7:30 am and will take 2-3 hours. from there i will go to the recovery room and stay there till i wake up and am stabilized, then i will move to my own hospital room. i will stay overnight there with mom. sometime tuesday afternoon, most likely, i will be discharged. i'll be home late tuesday, but mom (in her postal state-of-mind) has stated that she will discourage visitors on tuesday. on wednesday and after you should be fine--but again, this is my mother we're talking about. use your discretion. we've been lucky with electricity so far, but it could very well be shut off next week, so be forewarned. you can try to call but i can't guarantee that our phones will be working.</b>

aright, well, i think that covers it all. i'm going to get off. wish me luck!"

"event","well, i went to holly's mom's funeral today. ugh. i really hate funerals. as i'd predicted, it brought whooshing back a bunch of really icky memories that i'd've prefered to keep buried in my mind. in fact, one of the hymns at mrs. schult's funeral was ""abide with me"", which was sung at my dad's funeral. i got a really weird feeling when that song was sung. i think music holds a completely unique dimension of memories. feelings and thoughts that can't be put into memories are preserved in music, and when old music is heard it can sometimes bring back really poignant memories. weird. but i felt really bad for holly. i hope she's okay. i burned her some decemberists albums, hopefully they'll comfort her. they're damn good.

mom and i are getting up relatively early tomorrow and working all day so we can tire ourselves out and fall asleep early. oh, i don't think i've mentioned yet...

my surgery is scheduled for <b><i>7:30 am</i></b>. seven-fucking-thirty. but that's not the worst of it. i have to <i>be there</i> at <i>5:30</i>. five-thirty-a-m!! that's when i fucking fall asleep! so this means that we have to leave at 4:30 am and wake up around 4 am. christ. katie + mornings = asdfjdv.,cxvjoiewaljsa'wjoejqp. not pretty. at least i'll be put under soon enough and will sleep probably the rest of the day. but that seriously sucks. and the nurse that called to inform me of this told me to eat a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich at midnight (i have to fast after that). very random. i guess because it's protein and will keep me full until i can break my fast. but i still thought that was weird. 

i cleaned out our pantry. FUCK, there was a lot of shit. but on the upside i found a lot of jello, so that'll come in handy after surgery.

well, i've got a headache, so i'm gonna sign off. i'll update tomorrow.

thank you, electricity, for staying on."

anyways, god, i really love the decemberists. i feel the need to declare my love for them. they're absolutely amazing. i think i'll cry when i see them in concert. *sigh*"

to repeat:

"event","i'm on here at this particular moment because mom has been watching my time online like a hawk and barely even allowing me to check my email. and she's been insuffrable. what else is new. 

so, we've been cleaning this fucking shithole like madwomen the entire summer, right? fuck, i rang in the goddamn summer my first free week (alone in the house without her, miraculously) cleaning every square inch of this house from dawn till dusk, literally, on my hands and knees. one night my hands were blistered and bleeding because i'd scrubbed the bathtub so hard for so long. well, not much has changed since that first week...we're still cleaning from morning to night (yeah, i cleaned until 3 am today), and i think my chest is so clogged with dust from this house that i'm developing emphyzema. i'm bored to tears and weary as hell from all this shit (swear to god, this house will <i>never</i> be clean), but i've been working tirelessly nonetheless and trying to ignore mom's complaints about how when i'm going to have surgery she'll be left alone to do everything. she's laying a fucking guilt trip on me for the fact that i have to  have surgery. she's already informed me that she's not going to wait on me when i'm recovering, and that i'm going to have to deal with it myself and get over it. she's downplayed this surgery to the dust and claims that it's really not a big deal and i'll be back to normal after a day or two. even though the fucking surgeon himself said i shouldn't even return to normal life until a week has passed, and even then take it easy. she's determined to make everything seem as minor as possible. she wants me to be helping her clean again by thursday or so. i'm so tired of all of this.

even so, i've been gritting my teeth and taking her underhanded insults and cutdowns with a grain of salt, remembering that i've got a week and three days until i'm out forever, but today was just the last straw. she's been complaining about having to clean out heidi and justin's stuff, bitching about why they didn't clean out their own stuff when they left. we cleaned out heidi's room, and today cleaned out my closet where i had shoved all of the stuff of justin's that looked worthwile when he moved out and i took his room. all the time she bitched about how he didn't clean out his stuff. i didn't mind cleaning up after them much...it wasn't very hard and i enjoyed looking through all the old things that brought back memories. but she bitched and bitched and bitched. in fact, she quit early and left me to finish cleaning out the closet and tidying my room back up, i didn't mind, and finished a while later. when i came down, she was fine for a while but quickly began bitching about how ""us kids"" haven't cleaned out our things and how we've all left our shit for her to clean up after us. she said this a few times, emphasizing ""you kids"", but it seemed to me she was suddenly directing everything at me. i reproachfully asked why she was saying ""us kids"" when i'd cleaned out my room already, organized everything, and packed, and furthermore done most of the cleaning up after heidi and justin's stuff. she claimed that i'd left shit for her in the downstairs bedroom and in justin's old room for her to clean up, and what i expected her to do about it. i told her that all i'd left in both rooms were winter clothes that i wasn't taking to college yet, collection dolls that i don't want but that she insists i keep, and things i'm keeping for my apartment but can't take to my dorm. she told me i have to pack up all of this stuff before i leave for college because she's under the impression that she'll be moving this year (HA). i said ok, i will, but she continued to bitch, directing her hostility at me. she says i don't lift a finger to help her and that i leave everything out for her to clean. my rooms are <i>empty</i> she used the fact that there are a few books left on my bookshelf as proof that i'm leaving things behind for her to clean up when i'm gone. it was as if she were blaming me for the fact that heidi and justin left things in their rooms when they moved out. it was as if it were me that left them there, not them. she never once mentioned the fact that it was their stuff we spent two days cleaning, and chose instead to blame me for the collection dolls, winter clothes, and furniture i've left in my room after scouring it and throwing almost all of my things away. i pointed this out, and she said that heidi and justin had helped more than i ever have. at this point i was seriously offended. heidi has been out of this house for three years, and since then i've been the one that's done all the cleaning. mom hardly does a thing. while my friends go out at night, i stay home and clean until 3 am because i'm afraid i'll get screamed at if i ask to go out to see people i probably won't ever see again. i feel like fucking cinderella, minus the ball. i couldn't believe she was saying this to me. she basically told me that i was a lazy piece of shit that does nothing to help around the house while heidi and justin both were diligently clean and helped her immensely in cleaning out the house. when i asked her for an example, all she could account for was when heidi cleaned out the back bedroom. i pointed out then that i also cleaned out the back bedroom and emptied it, cleaned justin's old bedroom and emptied it, and cleaned heidi's room and emptied it, among other things. she didn't seem to think much of this. she blames me for the fact that i'm leaving and that she'll be left to deal with the house alone, and she tells me that i'm nothing but a spoiled little bitch who can't wait to get out and couldn't care less what happens to her or this house. she says this to the person who has given up all her paychecks and graduation money to see that the bills are met, the person who spent her entire summer locked in the house and slaving away and barely keeping in contact to the outside world except for trips to the dollar store to buy more garbage bags out of pennies i scraped up. i can't deny that i'm deeply hurt by the way she perceives me--an ungrateful, lazy, spoiled brat. it may be childish, but it really hurts my feelings.

i've been trying as hard as i can to let her caustic words roll off my back, but as always, they're sinking in and hurting my feelings. i can't help it. old, familiar feelings of over-emotionalism and insecurity are surfacing again. like people hate me no matter how i try and that i'll never be good enough. like i'm worthless. i don't know why i feel like this. i feel like shit. i hate it. i never wanted to feel this way again. why am i? i don't want to fall into depression again. i don't want to be vulnerable and emotional again. i'm tired of feeling inferior, and feeling stupid for feeling inferior. i hate this. i don't want to care, i want to go away and never see anyone again. i just want to be ok, alone and away from everyone. i can't be any better than i am. i hate this."

in other news, i don't feel great. it's from all the lack of fresh food, i think, and the excess of over processed food, mainly carbs. >headache< plus, and maybe also as a result of this, i've been sleeping <i>terribly</i>. i didn't fall asleep last night until 4, for no apparent reason. i even took robitussin and drank milk (contains tryptophan (sp?), the sleepy drug) before bedtime and nothing helped. it's not good. my throat has been sore and i've been coughing, i think because since mom and i have been cleaning we've been sending all this dust in the air and breathing it in. it's terrible. we tackled the basement earlier, but then as mom was taking some cardboard out to the tree lawn she witnessed a car accident right in front of our house, called 911, and had to hang around until they let her go. nobody was badly hurt, luckily. she's taking a nap now (we've both been sleeping terribly) and when she wakes up we're going to hit the attic in my bedroom, i suppose. i can't wait to see how many rodents have made it their home. *sigh*

i still feel really mentally unprepared for college. i want to dedicate some hardcore time into organizing and making sure i've covered everything, but with this rummage sale we're planning for saturday, my time has been eaten up. it's exasperating. tonight i'm going to take an hour before i go to bed and meditate. maybe that will help. 

oh, yeah. my new roommate's name is tara tatge. i'll have to call her tomorrow."

"event","i finished <i>the stranger</i>. good book. albert camus is the biggest cynical realist i've ever encountered--but way cool. he was a wonderful author...very influential. the only other one of his works i read was a short story, the title of which i've forgotten. anyways, it was a rather long short story that spanned the events of one night. it highlighted a man (and a few others) sentenced to be killed by a firing squad at dawn. man, it fucking blew me away. just his <i>realism</i> in itself is incredible. i mean, he doesn't mince words. he doesn't make things pretty or tasteful, he doesn't censor a thing. it's truly raw. <i>the stranger</i> was awesome as well. so honest in the beginning it was almost mundane, and so ridiculous and cynical at the end. it's a humbling sort of book. fuck, man, none of it matters. it really doesn't. do what you want, if it feels good. whatever. it's not bad. just kind of apathetic. neutral. 

so i have to ponder for a while more what i derived from this book. each book i read leaves me feeling a certain way, leaves me with some realizations and new ideas. they inspire me and empassionate me or depress me or anger me. it's all wonderful, no matter how it makes me feel. the fact that something holds that power is incredible, and should be appreciated. seriously, i think it's so important. reading literally broadens horizons, opens the mind, and plants new ideas. and as long as new ideas are continuously growing and evolving, people will progress. and progression fights hatred. even just reading things like harry potter is wonderful. i mean, look at it. harry potter has reached how many billions of people in how many countries? kids are turning off the tv and opening a book. <i>that</i> is incredible. i truly believe that reading is the best way to help people grow and learn. keep on reading, folks. 

anyhow, sorry, i didn't mean to turn this into a public service announcment. whenever i finish a book i'm struck by how powerful reading really is, and how it helps me and teaches me so much and makes me grow, and how i wish so many more people read regularly (not just the comic page or magazines). and how much better of a world this would be. seriously. ah, anyways. i'd really like to read a bit of an upper, now. something of inspiration, maybe. i want to read <i>the 12th planet</i>, but i don't think i'm in the right mindset yet. i was thinking about <i>candide</i>. i suppose we'll see. 

mom and i are on a mad last ditch effort to clean out the house and prepare for a rummage sale. today we cleaned out heidi's room (found nothing incriminating except a condom wrapper, hehe ;D), and tomorrow we plan on tackling either the basement or the attics. joy, i can't wait. both are equally gross. ah, well, such is life."

i just talked to my room mate tehl. she seems cool and nice. she told me that she got some uwm mail the other day and it informed her that we are getting--listen to this--a <i>fourth</i> room mate. FOUR room mates. in a triple room. fuck. 

the good side of this (yes, there is a good side) is that we're each getting reimbursed $360 or something. which definitely <i>definitely</i> rocks. will help very much. 

anyways, i've got two weeks until i move in. <i>two weeks</i>. one week until surgery. this is insane...summer is already almost over. the thing that sucks is that i've only got this one last week to hang out with my watertown friends, but i won't be able to drink or get high after today. gotta have a week free of substance to cleanse my blood. tonight i can, but sunday night isn't usually the prime for partying. whatever...i want to hang out with holly, beth, rachel, a-lo, kaitlyn, and call noah before i leave. he's being shipped out soon, i just want to say hi before he leaves. but damn...one week to finish everything up. and mom and i are having a rummage sale on saturday, so i'll be busy preparing for that. *sigh*"

"event","ugh. i just went to heidi's friend kim's wedding. at st. john's. ew, ew, ew. 

it was torturous. i really hate weddings...all that goddamn small talk. i hate it so much. and the fact that it was in st. john's...*shudder*. i felt contaminated walking into a place with so many pious people. pastor boehringer wouldn't even look at me. haha. ouch. all those damn people in dresses and heals and suits and ties and plastered hair and painted faces and tanned skin and painted fake nails...<i>damn</i>. i felt like i was at a circus. everyone was wearing fake smiles and telling horrible jokes and tittering. euch. terrible. thankfully it was a relatively simple wedding (as simple as those damn things get, i suppose) and kim was pretty. of all the scores of christian people, i think the roevers are the...well, best, i suppose. they're very simple and honest and good, without frill or pomp. i mean, their sheer <i>goodness</i> is incredible...i don't think they're capable of housing ill will toward anyone. that in itself is pretty freaky, and god knows i couldn't stand being around them for a very long time, but only because i'm so impure compared to them. i mean, i'm far to sinful to associate with them, but at least they're more real than the stupid gossipy christians that go to church because it's what you <i>should</i> do. they go because they really believe in christianity with conviction. as much as i loathe christianity, i find their honesty and wholesomeness admirable. it's nice to know that at least a few people who call themselves christian really mean it. 

anyways, i listened to pastor boehringer's sermon this time (it's way too easy to tune him out). i'd never realized what an abyssmal speechwriter he is. man, it totally sucked...i was almost embarrassed for him. his love for george w. bush must be so strong that he even tries to emulate his speeches. sad, very sad. i'm not really sure what the main point of the sermon was...i think it was something about king david praying for a marriage or something, but it contained everything from the pastor stating that the bride and groom purchased a cake and decorated it, to him lecturing the couple about how marriage really isn't as great as it seems, to him talking about how jesus a big sacrifice. haha. it really had no flow to it whatsoever...i had no idea what he was talking about 99% of the time. 

but, whatever. i've still got to go to the dinner and reception, and i'm very disgruntled at the thought of it. god, i hate fake smiles. it's actually painful to put up with.

anyways, i've started ""the stranger"" by albert camus. i think it'll be a nice follow up to ""on the road""...i really love camus' style. he's a wonderful writer. it shouldn't take too long; it's a short novel. 

well, i'm off to enjoy a few hours' peace before being tortured again."

"event","oh <i>god</i>.

i just fnished <i>on the road</i>. i don't even know what to do with myself. christ. i can't even articulate what i derived from the book. i suppose that's understandable...it's such an incredibly ambiguous book i can't imagine what critics had to say about it. 

but i thought it was amazing. my god. i've never encountered a book that so perfectly harnessed life at its most raw. soooo incredible. so <i>prolific</i>, profound, and honest. it's probably the most honest thing i've ever read. so <i>sad</i>. so very very gravely sad. not a depressive sad, not a whiney sad, just a perfect, beautiful, incredibly truthful sadness. it eminates from the core of the book. from the core of dean. everything about the book was sad...the road,  dean, every single character, sal himself, every city, the wilderness, the lifestyle, the music. whether it was a beautiful, pure sadness or a mournful, pitiful sadness, it was all there. life is sad, at its core. life is so many things, but at its purest, it's sad. don't get me wrong...i'm not saying that everything sucks and people should just sit around and cry all day. that's the opposite of what i mean. i just mean that life is so many things, life can be so many things, but the one thing that encompasses and exemplifies is all is the real, pure, raw sadness of it. it's beautiful. no wonder kerouac used the word ""sad"" to describe everything. it's the perfect word. 

the only true, honest thing i know for sure from this book is that it made me incredibly, deeply sad. dean. dean was the book, he was at the heart of everything. he was the god of the beat generation, and <i>on the road</i> was the bible. dean, the homeless kid who was born on the road, the hustler and con man, the nymphomaniac, the drug addict, the drunk, the man who was three times married and twice divorced, the maniac, the idiot, the young, crazy-eyed fiend of the night and the music and the road and women and kicks and <i>life</i>. he was so addicted to life, so completely delirious from the sheer essence of life that grows among the people and the wilderness and the road that can go anywhere, that he left humanity in the dust to pursue his own crazy kicks that fueled his life. he swallowed the earth and it radiated from him in waves like the waves of heat that radiate from the sun. people marveled at him, laughed at him, humored him, condescended him, pitied him, were delighted by him, and loved him...but they didn't--and they couldn't--understand him. no one ever could. he was like a child, amazed by everything, delighted by everyone, and could do nothing but rush around and gaze at everything incredulously, repeating, ""yes! yes!"" as if people were doing something incredible and profound and wonderful just by existing. and the people, in turn found him first endearing, odd, even wonderful, but they all grew annoyed at his constant incredulity and rushing and high-strung lifestyle and turned their backs on him, the angel. what they failed to understand, what they failed to <i>try</i> to understand that dean had a perfectly sane and ingenious grip on life and what life should be. he was delighted by people and things who were doing nothing but living, existing the best way they knew how. dean saw it, and that it was beautiful and miraculous and incredible and something that should be praised every day, every moment, and he <i>did</i>. he didn't stop for creature comforts, he couldn't stay locked in a house or in a steady paying job. he couldn't live such a common life and know that life was slipping him by. he wanted to cherish every breath he took and make every moment of his time wonderful and exciting, the way it should be. schedules don't matter, houses don't matter, all these trinkets and comforts and material things simply don't matter, whatsoever. life is to be attained in the raw, when material life is absent. enlightenment can only be gained when life is pure. dean pursued life with such a lustful, thirsty passion, he took no care for himself or his personal well-being. all that mattered was the pursuit of life, what others called his kicks. people who wanted nothing more than blind existence with false comforts saw dean's actions as ""throwing his life away"" (what they really meant was throwing his material, false life away) and caring only for himself and his kicks. they were incredibly wrong on that accusation. dean cared nothing for himself...he forgot <i>everything</i>, even himself, in his crazy pursuit for life. he saw everything and did his best to drink everything in, to <i>dig</i> life at its purest. i'm thinking especially of his trip to mexico and his kicks in san francisco and denver with the poor black jazz community. music, the purest form of expression when played by the soul, spoke to him and understood him and drove him. he idolized those who could make the music scream the blues and the craziness of life. he'd devoted his life to living, something that few know how to do. and at the end of the book, the final image of dean is prophetic. the image of him ""ragged in a motheaten overcoat he brought especially for the freezing temperatures of the East, walked off alone...rounding the corner of Seventh Avenue, eyes on the street ahead, and bent to it again."" shunted, however inadvertently, by his friends, penniless and friendless, unable to speak, a dejected angel of humanity mingling in the sleet and the trash and the cold, the one person to have harnessed life's essence and passion. what an incredibly representative image of where peoples' priorities lie. money over life, always. so incredibly sad.

but this book was amazing. astounding. it blew me away, totally. i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone and everyone. i want to harness the passion of life. i want to dig the road, drink in life at its purest, and lose myself in the craziness of the world. i don't want to waste away doing what should be done and following the proper procedure. god, i never want to waste away in contentedness. i never want to be comfortably numb. if i'm riddled with pain and sadness my whole life, i'd rather have that then the blind stupor of a structured life. to put it in a cliche, give me liberty or give me death."

"event","so...this is an entry that i've been working on at intervals since yesterday afternoon.

first and foremost: all of you guys should send my friend holly good, healing vibes. i'm not going to go into why, that's her personal business, but just send positive vibes the way of holly, katie's friend. seriously. hang in there, holly love. you know where to find me if you need anything. 

secondly...what a <i>day</i>. it was horrible. i feel ready to drop dead any second from sheer exhaustion. why is it that whenever any single good thing happens i'm immediately kicked while i'm up and forced to forget about the good things that happened? *sigh* well, the good thing is, everything's ok and worked out, but the circumstances to which i had to go just to make things okay are ridiculous. argh.

ok, so i woke up with a start when mom yelled, ""katie, get up, there's a good chance you're not going to college now!"" thinking, 'fuck, what <i>now</i>', i hurled myself out of bed and went into the dining room where mom was. she was on the phone with uwm, apparently. they'd called to say that if they didn't receive a payment of $2,760-something dollars by friday, they'd be cancelling my contract for school. let me just take this moment to explain mom and my current financial situation.

i have less than $20 to my name in my checking account at school, and $5 in savings. the money that used to reside in those accounts, along with my entire supply of graduation money, has gone to mom. mom has needed this money for bills which she cannot meet and a mortgage which she cannot pay. our money has gone to ensuring that our gas and electricity would remain fully functioning, preventing our house from foreclosing, keeping our car within our possession, and keeping our water flowing from our faucets to hydrate ourselves. the odds and ends of money left over has supplied our shelves with a loaf of bread, four cans of vegetables, lettuce, potatos, and peanut butter. this is our entire food supply at the moment. as there are only 4 slices of bread left, tomorrow we'll be taking advantage of st. vincent depaul's free bread supply for those who need it, and in a few days we'll be hitting up the food pantry of watertown. virtually nothing has been purchased the entire summer for our own comforts except the food which currently resides in our pantry. we've become very well acquainted with the value of potatos. living minimally is a household term here and a rather overstated understatement. mom's only account, her checking account, contains exactly $14. our combined wealth totals to <i>almost</i> $39. this summer, school supplies will not be bought, peanut butter will be eaten out of the can, lettuce will go bad but will still be eaten, moldy bread will be scraped of as much mold as possible and eaten, and things like flour and baking soda will become side dishes at meal time. i'm not exaggerating. ironically, a $9,000 surgery will be performed upon me on august 22. i think i may just change my name and identity and move to canada. yes, times are very very very hard, but when my financial aid statement arrived in the mail yesterday, i quickly forgot all of this and smiled at the generosity that's still abundant in this world. things <i>would</i> be okay.

back to the problem at hand. where did i leave off...ah, yes, i'd just been informed that i'd have to conjure up almost $3,000 in 3 days. i could charge $1,000 to mow peoples' lawns, but for some reason it didn't seem likely that anyone would be willing to fork over a grand to have their grass clipped. no matter how good at mowing i am. so. 

when mom got off the phone, she immediately started yelling at me for this. apparently the lady she talked to claimed that i'd been informed in may that this payment would need to be made and that if i had financial aid coming through it could be paid with that money if i filled out and sent some enclosed forms. apparently they'd also emailed me. now, i check my email religiously. as in, 2 or 3 times a day. i even check my junk mail. i <i>never</i> ever ever ever ever EVER received an email with this information...i would swear on my life. the likelihood of me having somehow missed this email is about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to 1. basically, it'd be more probable for the moon to suddenly drop out of the sky and land on earth. as to the supposed forms that they emailed me, i have saved every singled tiny bit of mail i've EVER EVER EVER EVER received from uwm in a uwm folder. mom and i each went through said folder 3 times, and neither of us found a thing. she reads almost all of my uwm mail and can't remember ever seeing any such form either. what's more, every time i've had to fill out some form and send it back to them, i've done it the day i got it or the day after because i know milwaukee is horrible with losing things and the availability for everything is so limited. i filled out my housing application and sent it back the same day i got it, and i still got a triple room. so i called uwm back and told them this and they said, whatever, it doesn't matter now because even if i had the proper forms and sent them back it wouldn't matter, it's too late. so i asked them what they expect me to do, and they said i need to pay this $2,760-something by friday. i said there is no way on this goddamn earth that i'd ever be able to come up with this money, that i'm totally broke. they said, well, can't you pay 1/3 of it? almost in tears by then, i choked out a ""ok, i'll call back"" and turned off the phone. mom proceeded to yell at me some more, and i lost it and started bawling. how fucking typical for me to receive almost $9,000 one day to help me go to school and then be called the next day to be informed that i'm going to be kicked out before i was even let in because $2,760 of that $9,000 can't be accepted because i didn't fill out forms that i didn't receive. fucking <i>typical</i>. i retired to my bedroom planning to make voodoo dolls of the uwm fucks who didn't send me the infamous forms and stab them repeatedly, but mom called me back to the living room and told me to call my grandfather (her dad) and ask for money--he's loaded. the idea horrified me. i could imagine the scenario--i meekly call up and ask for a little loan--$800 worth--while he sits in his overdecorated house with his high maintenance wife (step-gram laverne) and tries to remember who i am and whether i'm crazy for asking such a thing. 1) my grandfather and his wife are a bit--er--possessive with their money. to put it nicely. the idea that he'd loan me $800 is laughable, at best. 2) i met him once, when i was eight. i don't remember much. i highly doubt he remembers me much, either. i told mom i couldn't call up a man i didn't even know and ask him for almost a grand. she suggested i call gwen. the idea was more tolerable than with my grandpa, because gwen is my sister and i know her better. however, i still felt like vommitting at the prospect of calling her up and asking her to fork over $800 to me. she <i>is</i> my sister, and i love her, but still, she's the eldest of the six pennell kids, and i'm the youngest. there's quite an age gap. gwen moved out of the house when i was a newborn. a great rift exists in our family which has very little to do with any of us kids but has nevertheless forced each sibling to spread out across the country and rarely see/communicate with one another. only now is this rift beginning to be bridged. still i grew up barely acquainted with my older 3 siblings, gwen, leann, and brian. i didn't see gwen again until i was 7 or so, and when i saw her, i didn't know who she was. still i only see her once every 3 years or so...but now that she's living in chicago again hopefully that will be quite a bit more often. anyways, i wish i were closer to them. i hope now that i'm leaving home and making it on my own i'll be able to spend more time with them and get to know them as people, not just those siblings of mine. they're all so awesome. 

i got way off track. the point i was trying to make was that even though gwen is my sister, i see her very rarely and the prospect of calling her up out of the blue to ask for $800 was not only humiliating, but also <i>rude</i>. i felt horrible...not because i thought gwen would be angry at me for suggesting such a thing (she's far too gracious), but because i simply hate the idea of asking for help. i know it's silly, but god. i felt more humiliated than i've probably ever felt. anyways, i finally harnessed my nausea and pulled myself together to call gwen. i dialed, it rang a number of times, then the answering machine picked up. i left a message, trying with all my might to control the wobble in my voice, and said i just needed gwen to call me back as soon as possible, that it was relatively urgent. i hung up the phone and tried to make it back to my bedroom before all the frustration and humiliation came spilling forth, but failed. mom finally came and gave me a hug, using the opportunity to preach at me about turning back to god and praying about this. i bit back all the corrosive retorts i was willing to spew at her, thinking ""how <i>dare</i> she use my moments of weakness as opportunities to preach at me,"" but luckily the phone rang. i was falling apart at the seams and couldn't answer it, so mom did. turns out it was gwen, she couldn't get to the phone in time when she heard my message. mom explained the situation, told gwen i was too upset to speak, and asked gwen if she'd be able to help us. gwen was incredibly calm and explained that she's loaned money to many people many times but has rarely been reimbursed, and if i would promise to pay her back and be honest about the loan she'd give me the money. mom told her that we wouldn't dream of skiving off on this, and that we could write a contract and sign it if she'd like. she explained that my financial aid will come through to the college and first pay off my tuition for the semester, and then the remaining amount would be issued to me in a check. this would probably happen in mid-september, but knowing milwaukee could take far longer, but as soon as i received the money i'd send gwen her reimbursement. i'd finally calmed down by then and mom gave me the phone to talk to gwen. i thanked her a number of times, but she (as always incredibly calm and serene) simply said, ""oh, don't worry about it, kate. i don't want you to feel embarrassed about this or whatever...it's important that you go to college."" she said she was glad to help. christ. i don't think i've ever encountered a more gracious person...she just has this air of serenity about her and isn't ruffled by a thing. it's a very calming effect. i felt better after talking to her. she and mom talked for quite a while longer, while i gathered up my uwm papers (mom and i had been rifling through them in search of the phantom forms) and organized them and returned them to their folder, and then went through my surgery information and took notes on the things i have to remember and the things i have to do prior to and after surgery...three pages worth. i just wanted to condense the info into a go-to guide. when mom finally got off the phone we discussed how awesome gwen is for a while (she would send the money straight to uwm), and then went about our tasks. i was beat...crying is such a draining activity. and i had that gross ashamed feeling that you get after you've done something bad...the thing is, i hadn't done anything bad. i suppose i just felt weak and vulnerable for having to ask for moneyto simply survive--reason #3923045835093482023474983182739 i loathe money. at least i hate the magnitude of importance it holds in today's society. but i've already ranted about that. god help me, i will be independent some day and never ever ever worry about money again. 

so...that was a pretty shitty day. it would've been worse had gwen not come to the rescue. when i get off here i'm planning on cleaning up the living room, writing gwen's thank you letter, and then finishing cleaning my bedroom. i'm on a roll, it's starting to look pretty damn good. 

i suppose i don't have anything more to say on this matter."

speaking of which, i've been longing for some sort of drug-induced haze. not just marijuana; something i've not done before. an upper. i'm tired of just being high or drunk. however, prospects for this are impossible until i move into college, most certainly, because i don't want to pollute my veins before surgery. that wouldn't be a good thing. i guess i'll just have to look forward to vallium and vicodin until my opportunities broaden. but even in college...i mean, i'm not going to have much money. i suppose mostly drunkenness will do for a while....

today is a good day. i should be leaving for my pre-op appointment--oh...about now. however, since mom is still getting ready (very harassed-looking indeed, getting ready always seems such a hassle for her), i very highly doubt we'll be leaving until it's much later than we'd planned. this is mostly due to her lack of an accurate clock...she sets her bedside clock an hour and a half fast. no lie.

"event","*sigh* it was a weary sort of day today. mom and i were planning on hitting up the swing band that was playing at riverfest from 11:30-1, but she complained of a headache and not having enough money when we woke up, and said numerous times that she didn't want to go. naturally, i took that to mean she didn't want to go (it's hard to argue that my assumptions weren't logical), and was disappointed, but i've long since given up arguing with my mother. it's probably the most fruitless thing in the world to do; i just don't bother anymore. anyways, later in the day she complained that we didn't go to see the band because i wasn't ready in time. considering the fact that all i needed to do to get ready was throw on some jeans and a t-shirt, which would have taken 2 minutes at most, i found this accusation ridiculous. we argued and she became suddenly deaf whenever i spoke, so i gave up and went outside and took my aggressions out by mowing the backyard lawn, seething and trying to list all of the things that are infuriating about my mother. naturally, i failed, the list is far too ambiguous and complicated. anyways, turns out a good 2 hours of physical labor in the heat and the sun and the earth is good for the system--i came inside feeling beat but virile. but that was the high point of the day. mom was insuffrable as always, whether nagging me about some pointless misdemeanor i committed ten years ago or antagonizing me incessantly by pinching me and grabbing me and bellowing incomprehensible pet names into my ear; she grew more and more aggressive as i grew more and more aggrivated. she feeds off my annoyance, i swear to god. anyways, i knew she secretly wanted to go to riverfest later that night because as much as she denounced it, i knew she enjoys the crowds and the socializing. so i encouraged her to go, told her she constantly complains about having no life, and now that an opportunity had come along to go out, she should take advantage of it. she hemmed and hawed but when her friends called i knew she'd go. she hemmed and hawed to them but told them to call her at 7 and let her know where they were so she could meet them--<i>if</i> she felt like it. nonetheless, she got dressed and dolled up, agonized over what to wear and complained that she hated going out. 7:00 rolled along and she waited impatiently for them to call. by 7:10 she was screaming about how she has no friends and they don't care about her and she was tired of them treating her badly. i suggested she call her friend's cell, but she refused. 7:30, 8:00, 8:30 came along. by then she was sobbing and screaming about her lack of friends and how she hated people and how no one cares about her. still refusing to call them. it's 11:14 and riverfest is over for the year. mom is in bed probably brooding over the fact that she has no friends. around 10:30 she decided to blame me for the fact that she got stood up, and i told her point blank that it wasn't my fault and that i've gotten stood up plenty of times but life goes on. she'd just prefer to pout and keep her pride wrapped around her like a wilted movie star clinging to her last sad mink. i feel bad, i know the feeling of being left in the dust sucks, but she really should've just swallowed her pride and called her goddamn friends. now she's renounced them and is planning on bitching them out the next time she talks to them. god, sometimes all i can do is shudder at the way she handles things. so imperiously, so tyrannically. it's her way or no way, no bending things. no forgiveness. you screw up once and you're written off. i think that's just bullshit. i hope to god i never inherit these characteristics when i'm old and disillusioned. 

anyways, my brief moment of ecstasy at the prospect of having an entire night alone, just to myself, was quickly snuffed. i hate disappointment. i ended up halfheartedly whiling away the hours watching a cheeseball mptv special called ""celtic woman"". i was vaguely interested by the title, given my interest in celticism, but the actual special turned out to be a badly done concert put on in green bay featuring a number of vaguely red-headed female singers and a fiddle player singing celtic-related songs. i could only laugh at the deplorable set up and lack of talent (except in the case of the fiddle player...she was actually pretty good but the way she leaped around stage and made cheerleader faces and whipped around her bleached out hair killed the effect for me), but the sheer pathetic quality of the show kind of summed up my feelings and released the sad energy into my body. the girls were decorated in an assortment of almost glamorous dresses, a large quantity of metallic white eye-shadow and black eyeliner, and bleached out plastered up hair that only vaguely reminisced what it naturally was at one point in time. when they took a break and the sad wasted saleswomen from pbs came on and tried to sell the concert on dvd or vhs, i couldn't take the desolation the show represented and turned it off. i reverted back to the computer, but quickly lost faith. mom suggested i go to culvers and buy an assortment of heart-attacks-on-a-plate so that she could drown her sorrows in calories, and i quickly consented, glad for the chance to get out and at least breathe in some cool night air and enjoy good music to comfort me. the drive and the music were the perfect shade of melancholy and just what i needed. when i got home i ate a bit and reverted back to the book i'm rereading, <i>on the road</i> by jack kerouac. 

i read this book early in the summer, just after school got out, but it wasn't the appropriate time for such a novel and i couldn't appraise it accurately. so i'm rereading it now; it's the absolute perfect time. i'm already to page 177, part three, about 2/3 of the way through. it's like an addiction, like a great unsatisfying thirst that confuses me and mystifies me but makes so much sense, perfect sense, and compells me through the book tirelessly. it's like by reading the book i'm taking on a fraction of dean's neurosis, becoming affected by his constant ""yes! yes! yes!"" and rabid lust for life. it's like being awake for 32 hours, wired and stimulated by lack of sleep and caffeine and sugar and anything else to aid in the unending rush, rush, rush. i absolutely love kerouac's writing style. it takes a while to become accustomed to it, but once immersed it's impossible to break away. it's like a constant flow...none of it is written formally. he could very well be telling the story to a friend, simply speaking what he writes. he's the king of run-on sentences and wordiness and casual vocabulary...he's probably ms. cnare's arch-nemesis. which of course makes me like him even more. but this great crazy combobulation of mismatched words and runon sentences as beatnik slang evens out to the perfect equation, the perfect style for such a story. the style <i>is</i> the story; the tale is reflected so vividly in the way kerouac writes, i can taste, smell, and see the things he writes of. and i <i>feel</i> what he felt, most importantly. that crazy rush and manic thirst for life and passion and <i>soul</i>. i don't think any other author has been able to communicate this lust nearly as effectively as kerouac does. it's not written as the AUTHOR observing and writing with wisdom of the fellow man, it's the author living with and as the fellow man, and telling the things he knows. so very very honest it almost hurts. so far my favorite character is old bull lee, the crazy heroin addict living in new orleans in a shack with his wife and kids, a guy who's traveled the world, who knows so much, who holds with wisdom of centuries, and yet lives on the so-called ""bottom rung of society"" by absolute choice. he seems to embody everything i admire. and of course i love dean, and kerouac himself as sal paradise. ""nobody gives a damn,"" but it's wonderful. just life, pure, raw life. goddamn. 

anyways, i've been thinking about writing and literature for a few days now. thinking about my relationship with the written word and where i'm going with it, what i'm going to do. me being a self-proclaimed writer. what's my style. what's my talent...do i have talent or do i merely spend the hours with words and thoughts flowing forth from my fingers because i've got nothing else to do? i don't know, i really don't. i'm not good at anything else. not good enough. i could spend my life in a publishing house correcting other peoples' grammar usage and aiding in the graduation of other peoples' aspirations to realizations, helping them write books, some crappy, some profound. but i wouldn't be happy. there <i>is</i> nothing else for me. if i didn't have the written word, the ability to translate my thoughts to words, i would explode. sometimes i feel like i'll expload if i can't come on here the instant i feel emotion pulsating through me and unload the weight of life onto something a bit more tangible. i feel like i'll die if i can't write, if i can't create. but i need more, i can't waste my life an amateur aspiring author pouring her words onto an online journal for others to read and judge. i simply can't do it. i would derive no fulfillment in doing so. it's like <i>on the road</i>--my need to write is an unquenchable thirst, a mad compelling drive and lust that pushes me forward with the might of a thousand horses, forcing me to send my fingers racing into oblivion in the hopes that my thoughts and feelings will be translated into something truthful and pure and explosive and powerful. but i don't know if i've got what it takes. i don't know...self-doubt always seems to shroud my aspirations and sends me second guessing and revising until i've got nothing left but a poor wasted attempt at literature. i could <i>never</i> ever ever ever dream up something like the world of harry potter and send my visions streaming onto paper as gracefully as jk rowling so eloquently did. NEVER could i create something so incredible. that's not even taking into account others, genius minds like orwell and hesse and tolkein and weissel and atwood and all the other greats out there, many of which i've yet to even discover. how could i ever creat something to the caliber of their genius? how could i create something even worth reading, something other people might find even only <i>good</i>, when most people don't even listen to my thoughts, writing everything i have to say off as just the idealistic passions of a kid? how can i make people listen to me when they're so hell bent upon condescension? but <i>do</i> i have things to say? nothing more than i already know...i know lots of things, i've got the wisdom of youth and experiences lots my age have yet to discover, i know only what i've consumed these 18 years, but compared to the greats of the world of word, i'm a miniscule speck. why would anyone want to read what i have to say? i'm only just acquainting myself with life, unclouding my vision from the mundane, a newborn baby opening her eyes to a new world. and yet i feel that if i can't create something beautiful, if i can't project something honest and true into a web of words, if i can't mold the essence of life as i know it into a sculpture of words, i will die and life will be pointless. if i can't channel this passion and create something that others can benefit from in some way, i will have failed in my life attempts. there's so much i want to do, so much i want to communicate, so much i want to write. but if there's no one there to tell me at least i'm doing what i should be doing, no one there to pat me on the back and tell me i'm following my calling, i don't know if my convictions can withstand. i'll feel like an ass writing superfluous fluff, nothing anyone's not already seen. i'm not emily dickenson, i could never be as strong as her and keep my writings secret. i want to be heard, i couldn't stand remaining silent. i know i spend lots of time on adjectives, writing starry-eyed imagery and probably failing to appear competent, but i really can't help it. it truly is my passion...i just wish i could prove it. if i can't create something worthwile with words, the air might as well just cease in its mad circulation through my lungs, my heart should rest and give up its faithful pulse of life to such a mundane being."

"event","totally perfect explanation to the problems i was having with the DD/snape theory <lj-cut text=""here."">Snape took the Unbreakable Vow, because to do otherwise would have broken his cover. Dumbledore knew Malfoy was trying to kill him, because Snape told him. Dumbledore and Snape had been arguing about something throughout most of the book. The general consensus is that Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, if it came down to it. Why would Dumbledore do this? Well, he knew that if Malfoy failed, he and his family would be killed. Dumbledore also knew that Malfoy was doing what he was doing not because he was evil, but because he had to. Malfoy, despite being a prat, loves his mother and father, and does not want to see harm come to them. In Dumbledore's eyes, Malfoy is an innocent, and he does not want their lives at risk, even if it means forfeiting his own. Of course, he offered Malfoy a way out at first, because he does not want to throw his life away, but he was willing to give it up if need be. When he began pleading with Snape, he wasn't scared of dying. I think we'd both agree that's out of character for him. He was afraid Snape wouldn't do what he had to, both to protect Malfoy, and to save his own life should he not fulfill his vow. Snape killed Dumbledore because Dumbledore not only wanted him to, but ordered him to, if it was necessary...and it was.

Also, remember Harry's fight with Snape after? Snape was giving him pointers the whole fight. ""Learn to fight with your mind closed and your mouth shut,"" or something to that effect. Snape is now going deep undercover. So deep, that the only person that knows is now dead.</lj-cut> thanks to whiterussian9 for clearing that up. also, ann made a great point about <lj-cut text=""RAB."">also, go back over RAB...there's a mention of an unopenable locket at 12 grimmauld place when they're cleaning. there's your horcrux. perfect jo style too, mention the guy in passing, vaguely alude to something super super important to a later book in a previous book...it just works.</lj-cut> so regulus would've left the locket at 12 grimmauld place, not having been able to destroy it for some reason or something. it makes perfect sense. so those are two convictions i've made that i'm sticking to, now. thanks for reinforcing my doubts, folks.

mom started crying today about me leaving. *sigh* i feel bad, but i'm not sad at all. anyways, i'd rather have her feeling sad about me leaving than screaming at me and telling me she can't wait till i'm gone. this way's better. 

last night she was commenting on the fact that i haven't shaved my legs all summer, and how it's gross. i told her i just plain don't shave anymore. my reasons for doing so are a) it's a social norm for girls to shave their arm pits and legs but not guys, and i just think that's lame and sexist, b) shaving irritates my sensitive skin and i really don't mind having hair grow where it natuarally does, c) why would i bother shaving my underarms and legs and not my head? i mean, hair grows on my head, and i don't want to shave that, so why should i bother my legs and underarms? they're perfectly fine the way they are.  mom told me it was gross and unhygienic not to shave my armpits, and as long as i'm in her house i'll shave them, because she wants her kids to be clean. i asked her why she didn't make justin shave his armpits when he lived here if it was so unhygienic, and why something that is completely natural and normal is unclean. that'd be like saying that fingernails are unhygienic and we need to rip them off of our fingers because it's gross for them to grow where they naturally do. or that eyebrows are disgusting and need to be shaved of because having eyebrows is unclean. i shower daily, brush my teeth and wash my face twice a day, wear clean clothes, and feel comfortable and clean. i don't understand how hair makes me unhygienic, and why it only makes women unhygienic and not men, even though men have more of the hair. personally i think shaving is far more unhygienic, dangerous, and unnatural. i mean, weilding a bacteria-ridden blade over my poor unsuspecting skin, occasionally slicing open my leg and contracting tetanus from the gross razorblade i was using? no thanks. she got all pissed and said she'd ground me if i didn't shave my underarms, so i decided to bite the bullet and avoid conflict as much as possible for her jaded generation-X sake for these last 23 days simply because it's easier that way. and since armpit hair is obviously much more important to her than it is to me, i shaved. haha. i really didn't know something so petty and silly and natural was so controversial to a self-proclaimed feminist and liberal. eek. silly little hypocrite. 

i wouldn't have pushed this argument had i not been in a bad mood and thinking about my body in a rather protective manner last night. i have so many body issues, i'm so self-critical and hard on myself about the way i look. obviously i'm a product of my environment, but since i'll be leaving this environment and taking control of my own environment in 23 days, those archaic gen-X thoughts are beginning to shed. for one thing, i've cared far too much how other people perceive the way i look, whether they'll like it or not, whether i look good enough for them. but christ, isn't that silly? i'm the only person who should care what i look like and meet the standards of. i mean, i've got to live in this body for who knows how long. what gives other people the right to dictate how i look? i mean, i'm not speaking in literal terms here...obviously when i walk out the door the people passing by on the street don't tell me i look like shit and to go back inside and ""fix"" myself. i just mean that for so long i've worried about what other people will think of the way i look. entire days at school were ruined by the fact that (despite how comfortable i felt) i looked ugly or too natural or <i>not</i> like i'd spent hours in front of the mirror before coming to school (god forbid), and i actually slept in a few minutes. but that's so ridiculous. i'm the one that sees me looking back at myself from every reflective surface, i'm the one that spends 24/7 inside this body, i'm the one that's lived 18 years as katherine lynn pennell and will live a few more as her before i die. in short, i am who i am, and i've already wasted time trying to look like someone that isn't me, some elusive image that the rest of the world really likes but that just isn't me. and, well, that's just stupid. i've had it drilled into my head, living here, that what i look like naturally isn't good enough and whenever i step foot outside the door i'd better look like someone i'm not, spend endless amounts of money on ""improving"" my look, when i could be spending it on something much more healthy, much more useful, much more productive, and much more pleasant and pleasurable. i've never enjoyed that concept, i've never felt good about myself trying to be something else (because of course i will never be something else). far too much negative energy. i'm tired of the excuse, ""no, i'm just <i>enhancing</i> my look!"" 1) no, i'm not, i'm masking my natural features and pretending i've got other ones, 2) my godamn look doesn't need enhancing, nature molded the body that grew to be me, and natures a hell of a lot smarter than i or anyone else could hope to be, so i'm going to leave it up to her to decide what features i need. FAR too much stock is put into looks. i'm quite guilty of it; it's inherent aquarian nature to be attracted to aestheticism and beautiful things. but beautiful things aren't anything. beautiful people can be horrid inside, and horrid looking people can be incredibly beautiful on the inside. i know it's cliche, but the point i'm trying to make is that beauty is completely relative and, i'm sorry to say, absolutely pointless. i have a fully functioning body (well, for the most part...after august 22 my body will be fully functioning). it has the ability to think happy, enlightening thoughts and create euphoria and make beautiful music and take me anywhere i'd like to go and create new <i>life</i> and simply survive on this planet in perfect harmony without any additions, subtractions, or ""enhancements"". my skin is soft and protective, my organs productive and helpful, my nerves and brain pleasurable and progressive, my hair is shiny and red and warms me in the winter and whips my face when it dances with the wind, my eyes are green and in good condition and allow me to see how incredible this planet and its creatures are, my nose smells good things and does its job without complaint, my mouth is red and creates song and communicates joy and love and truth and peace with others just like me, my limbs and my fingers and toes propel me through life without complaint, my muscles are strong and supple and support me every day, and my heart faithfully pumps blood to every part of me to nourish my body every day, all day until the day i die and it gets a well deserved rest. i'd say i'm absurdly lucky and priviledged to be who i am and have what i have. my body is a good body and does everything it's asked with passion and fervence. i think that's pretty awesome. i want to treat it how it deserves to be treated. it deserves to be treated nicely and rewarded with rest after a good, hard day of living, and nourished with healthy, good quality fuel, and kept clean and in good working order. if some fellow human decides they like who i am eventually and would interact well with them, then that's quite nice and generous of them. however, i am who i am, and my body is a massive part of who that is, and as i'm the one that lives inside this body, i'll decide what i like it to look like. and i like how i look. i like my blond eyelashes...they're long and protect my eyes well. i like my ruddy skin...it shows lots of color and translates the feelings inside me to the outside rather productively. i like the fact that i have an inherently scottish or welsh look about me. i like how my body behaves. i am perfectly fine <i>just how i am</i>. no subtractions, additions, or ""enhancements""."

ugh, disgusting. i found my long lost flip flop upstairs (my favorite pair, they're black and soft and really really comfy...i wear them as slippers), came down to take out the trash, and was promptly peed on by spinach juice when the bag leaked. *shudder*

my room is coming along nicely. apart from the dust, i enjoy purging it of its filth. it's theraputic.

yeah, so i'm just gonna go amuse myself until it's time to sleep. god, i <i>really</i> have no life. *sigh*

i finished HBP again. god. it was just as horrifyingly painful to read as it was the first time...but i got more out of it this time, rather than simply being blinded by shock. i won't say anything about it just now. i need to steep in the post-book feelings for a while before i can gather my thoughts. i did want to ask one thing though. <lj-cut text=""i'm cutting this out of sheer grace, but you people who've not yet read HBP should just get off your asses and do it already!"">so, i think we've all heard the theory that the reason snape killed dumbledore is because dumbledore was dying slowly and painfully, and that's what DD was pleading for, and the look of disgust on snape's face was either snape feeling disgusted that such a great wizard was in such a state, or simply a ruse. playing at being on voldemort's side. whatever. i'd like to hear more about this theory, because it doesn't explain how snape could've known that dumbledore would need snape to kill him months before this episode. it doesn't explain the unbreakable vow. it doesn't explain much of anything...it's kind of a stab in the dark, blind hope that snape isn't <i>that</i> bad. and what the hell is snape going to do now? i mean, if he was doing dumbledore a favor in killing him, how the hell does he expect anyone to believe that? how could he think he'd still be accepted by the order of the phoenix without them killing him the moment they see him? this whole theory is faulty, i just don't see how it could possibly work. and didn't jkr state in the interview with the leaky cauldron and mugglenet that it was hard to make snape do what he did, but that he's indeed a bad guy? i dunno, i'll have to look that part over again, but i seem to remember, when emerson asked her about snape, her shaking her head and confirming that dumbledore was wrong about him.   but yeah. that's all i wanted to know. oh yeah--does anyone have theories about RAB? aside from regulus black? i'm kind of leaning toward a character not yet introduced. i'd like people who've read HBP to comment on this entry and give specific reasonings for likes/dislikes, also. and general comments. i haven't discussed the book with anyone, i think we've all been way shocked.</lj-cut>

anyways, yeah. got stuff from the financial aid office about applying for a stafford loan. so i spent all afternoon online taking this goddamn <i>test</i> that they make you take for some lame reason, and i'm not even finished. i finished the test, but now i've got to do another load of shit before i can even apply for the loan. this is ridiculous. mom's getting a run around about the stock she's trying to close out as well. turns out she has to do about three million things just to prove that she owns the stock, then open an account at some business, then transfer everything there, and <i>then</i> she can finally touch the fucking loan and go about closing it out, which will probably take a month in itself. this is ridiculous. there's no more money to last us througout the summer. all of my graduation money is gone--to bills or buying a loaf of bread and some canned food to last us through the rest of the summer. there's seriously NO money. i guess i won't be getting anything more for going to college...good thing we've already gotten most of my stuff. i don't know how i'll get books for my classes. i'm certain by now that there won't be money until halfway through september. there's not even enough money for gas. how we're going to have enough to get to and from madison on monday for my pre-op, to and from madison the 22 for my surgery, and to and from milwaukee the 29 so i can move in is absolutely beyond me. i did find a check from st. john's for $10 from when i won the art gallery competition in 8th grade though, so they renewed that for me. i guess that will cover one trip to madison. as for the others, everyone's guess is as good as mine. i'm really goddamn sick of being poor. and i'm angry that this has stressed me out. i'm usually very good about never worrying and never stressing myself out (i've dealt with so much stress in my life that i've sworn it and anyone who stresses me out off), but somehow the task of procuring $7,000 out of thin air in 24 days has stressed me out. i'm tired of all of this; i'm tired of banking on miracles to help me survive. it's impossible. it sickens me that i've been tempted to choose a major that will provide me with no passion and no thirst for life, but will rake in a large ammount of money with which to live. i won't do it, i don't think i could ever do that, but i hate the fact that i have to worry about money so much that i'd even <i>think</i> of such a thing. i hate the fact that life as we know it revolves around money--that fully functioning, average human being can't <i>survive</i> without <i>money</i>. seriously. what is money? it is nothing but a symbol of human greed. it serves no purpose in helping a human live, and yet s/he cannot survive without it. the great sickening paradox on which the world turns. i feel like vomitting. i hate all of this. 

all these bad feelings rose in me today, and what was a beautiful day was ruined by all these negative thoughts dumping from my subconscious into my conscious mind. for the first time in a long time i was consumed in worrying, and i saw again why i hate worrying so much. it's pointless, it results in nothing but bad energy and wasted hours. when people worry, they end up doing things like overeating, oversleeping, and neglecting themselves and everything they care about. and worrying results in nothing. it's a complete waste. far too much of my life has been wasted on worrying. i just want to be carefree and enjoy life and pursue my dreams...alas, this is idealistic wishful thinking, immature and starry-eyed. but i don't want to become old and jaded. i want to enjoy life. i want to do all this without worrying about stupid things like money. this is all stupid and stressful and annoying. there are far more important things in life on which to concentrate my energy and focus. i hate all this. 

anyways, these bad feelings in me made me think about my summer. i had such plans for it, such hopes. i wanted to shed the gross wasted skin of high school and the former chapter of my life and cleanse who i am. i wanted to figure some things out, spend time out in nature and come into myself a bit more. get a grip on my life. i haven't done a thing. i know college will do this, but i wanted to take advantage of this last summer of freedom and indulge in peace. i forgot that there IS no peace to be had in this house, and it's rarer for me to <i>escape</i> this house than to fricking find a dinosaur fossil in my back yard. i don't know. i just wanted to figure out...<i>something</i>. and i didn't. i knew this summer was going to suck, but not this much."

anyways, yep. things are pretty much the same, except that i feel better and my throat is considerably less sore. i'll probably be recovered by monday, which will suck because i really could've had surgery. meh. i'll deal with it. things will be fine.

i stepped out of doors for the first time in a week today. amazing.

mom told me that she called the FAFSA office this morning and i'm definitely getting a reward in addition to the $2,600 they've already given me. i'm not sure how big, but this is AWESOME. every little bit counts. currently mom and i are living off of the $20 left from my $500 of graduation money. the rest of it was given over to various bills. but we'll be fine. i'm sooooo happy i'm getting a little bit more. 

p.s. heidi...do you still need $10? i'm sorry, i totally forgot. i can mail it to you right away if you need it, it won't be a problem. just leave me a comment and let me know."

"event","well, this weekend sure as hell sucked. like, you have no idea the ammount of suckage it produced. pretty much one of the suckiest weekends of my life. i'm still not sure why it all happened. the bad energy was almost palpable, and it stuck with me. i felt like i needed niacin and water just to flush all the bad energy out of my system. as i was driving home (at 11:30 pm) on the interstate, the scenery was directly projected from my mood. there was nothing but black, starless night, and the endless procession of cars streaming forth, each one searching for his/her pointless, wasted life. very very bad energy. i arrived home to my powerless house (a fuse had blown and we hadn't the time to replace it), ate some food in the dark, and fell into restless, nightmare peppered sleep. not a good night. 

anyways, i pretty much just want to forget it happened. what happened would resurface all that bad energy again, and i'm sick enough. i really don't want to deal with that. things are relatively fine (or as fine as they'll ever be), and i'll be out of here in <i>28 fucking days</i>. 

so, yep. i'm as sick as ever, except now on top of a swollen throat and glands the size of my thyroid, i've got a congested chest that coughs eight times a minute (i counted) and prevents me from breathing normally in sleep. i went to urgent care today, the doc diagnosed me with bronchitis and a sinus infection, and i'm on zithromax. woop-de-doo.

well, how did my pre-op appointment, which was scheduled for today, go, you ask? ha. good question. it didn't. we cancelled, since i'm so goddamn sick. AND--to put the icing on the cake--we had to push back my surgery. so today was pretty much my worst nightmare realized. oh, we couldn't push the surgery back a week. noooooo. we pushed it all the way back to AUGUST 22. yep. that's correct--exactly one week before i move into college! well, this is just peachy. i'll have exactly one week to lay on the couch under haze of narcotics to mentally prepare myself for the biggest transition of my life. one week for this giant surgery and physically traumatic event to recover. and then i'll be moving into college, very possibly still under haze of narcotics, with a great bloody 3-inch incision poking out of my fucking neck. i really <i>really</i> can't wait.

just when i think the ammount of suckage in my life can't increase one more inch, a ten ton load of suck drops on my head from great god above. thanks for this awesome hand you've dealt me. or not. 

i think i'll go attempt the first ever in-home self-induced thyroidectomy. should be fun. can't wait to see the blood. i'll pickled the damn thing and bring it with me to college. you know. nice conversation starter. good pick-up line. ""hey, want to come back to my room and see my goiter? yeah, thought so."""

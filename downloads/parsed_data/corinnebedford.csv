But in spirit of getting ready for a new game and new ideas, I'm compiling Cori's journal entries and notes to myself about the wonderful game experience I had.  If there are stories, or memories or secrets you would like to share about your character and cori, please do so, it'll make a great addition for me to read and remember and smile.  Post them here, or email them, either way, I'd appreciate it.

See you at the new beginning!

"event","<bold>She folded her clothes, hands slowing as thoughts rambled through her mind.  She placed another sweater in the suitcase and stopped to look around the room.</bold>  His room.  He had tried hard to make her comfortable here, but it was failing miserably.  Particularly when Cara was there to go out of her way to make Cori feel unwelcome.  Why Cara felt so insecure and jealous around Cori still baffled her. Cori had given her no reason to feel eiter way.  On the contrary, Cori had gone out of her way to make things smooth, if only for Jake's sanity.  

She had hoped to get away for her meeting without Jake's notice.  Goodness knows that Cara wouldn't notice, or if she did, she would notice just to tattle that ""Cori was sneaking"" or some such childish thing that Cara seemed prone too. Another mystery of Cara O'Conner, and it irritated her.  Her efforts to hide it were growing thin.  Miss O'Conner, who was surely older than Cori herself in not only kindred, but mortal years, couldnt manage to find it in herself to behave as such.  It drove Cori mad, and many times Cori chose to leave the room rather than confront her and cause Jake to glare with anger.

She had planned her meeting at the same time Jake was supposed to be going to Alexandra's again.  <bold>Her eyes narrowed slightly at the thought of the woman's name and her fingers clenched on the dress she was packing.</bold>  When Jake had discovered she was leaving, he was suspicious and wary.  He always questioned her as if she was doing something wrong, but never hesitated to flit off here and there when he was needed without telling her.  He had responsibilites, who didn't?   She also understood he had not had good experiences before, but he always seemed to forget that neither had she.  And once more, he was going to meet with a woman that had caused part of her heartache.  She had not questioned it, she trusted that it was as innocent as it was presented, even though once in a while something itched at the back of her brain.  

<bold>Shaking her head, she closed the suitcase and locked it.</bold>  He would never understand where she stood in all of this, never see things from her view and know why she was quiet and soft spoken about so many things.  Not that she expected him too, likely no one would be able to understand unless they actually opened her mind and looked.  She looked around one more time for things she may have forgotten and was surprised by the thought that presented itself <i>Will you be returning?</i>

<bold>She stopped, arms dropping to her sides as she gave a moment to the thought.  A rush of emotions ran through her, enough to stun anyone who had been reading her aura at that moment.  The storm subsided and she refused to give answer to her own unspoken question as she left for the airport.</bold>"

"event","She leaned back and watched out the window as the cab traveled toward her hotel.  The man's presence mingled with everything else in her mind.  <i>He was kindred, and of Boston. He'd proved that with the ease of which he gave directions to her hotel, but he had not troubled her in the least.</i>  Her door opening brought her out of her reverie and she paid the driver before going inside.  She smiled at the doorman and the appreciative glances she got as she approached the registry desk. Much to her surprise the girl spoke Japanese,  ""Sora Fajita.  My associate should already be checked in.""  The girl behind the desk checked for the reservation and nodded, giving her a key and directions and ended by telling Sora her things were already in the room.

Upstairs, thoughts of the stranger flowed out of her mind as she looked around.  The room was as she expected when she travelled:  A suite with seperate bedroom, fresh flowers adorning it, hot food and drink waiting, heavy velvet curtains hung over the windows and, silk on the bed.  She picked up the phone and dialed her associate.  ""Hello Taro, I have arrived.  Has there been any word on the meetings?  Understand I am very anxious to speak with the head of Franklin Park Zoo, so please be sure to do everything necessary to keep it from falling through.  Wake me at sunset and have everything I require ready.  Thank you and goodnight, Taro.""  She hung up the phone and changed into a silky nightgown and robe. 

Curling up on the sofa in the living quarters,  she started going through the presentation she had put together for tomorrow's meetings.  She was reading over the last paragraph, checking for mistakes in her English when there was a knock on her door.  Frowning, she put the papers aside and looked through the peep hole to see who it was.  The man in the duster stood on the other side.

She rubbed her temples <i>""I do not have time for this.""</i>  and there was another knock at the door.  She opened the door partially, staying partly hidden from his sight.  She collected her English for a moment and he watched her, not saying a word.  She bowed slightly from her place behind the door, ""I thank you for your assistance tonight.  It is greatly appreciated. Is there something I can do for you?"""

"event","Cori sat down at the piano in her living room and plucked out a few notes to give her a starting pitch.  She ran though a few vocal exercises Alejandro had taught her and moved on to one of the pieces she was working on, a little more difficult than ""Twinkle Little Star.""   She had canceled their lesson the past week.  She was still shaken up by events in Mt. Pleasant and didn't want him to see her like that.  She wanted to be strong for the Rose, with everything he was going through, he didn't need to even consider worrying about her on top of it.  She played as she sang, stopping and beginning again every time she came off pitch or didn't hold the note long enough.  She would make her teacher proud, she was determined.  

Her cell phone rang and she ignored it, concentrating on her breathing and the richness of the notes that came from her mouth.  When the song was finished, she checked her voice mail and found that Alejandro had been the one to cancel this time.  He sounded a little tired, a touch aggravated and like her the week before, needed to cancel without explanation.  She dialed his number, and when greeted by his voice mail, left him a return message that she'd see him the following week and to take care.

Sitting at the piano again, she began once more, this time recording the song onto a audio cassette.  When she had completed the three songs she had been working on, she tucked the cassette into an envelope and mailed it off to him so he'd see she hadn't been slacking."

"event","Her night hadn't started out so terribly, she had decided to send her traveling companion ahead to the hotel and stop at a eatery she had spotted during the taxi ride from the Logan airport.  The meal was pleasant, the noise of the restaurant much different than what she was accustomed to in Japan, the clinking of silverware on plates grated on her nerves so much that she found herself closing her eyes and focusing deep inside to push the irritation away...eyes met hers the last time she opened them.  A young man in a long duster peered at her through the window, his gaze curious and non threatening, but it made Sora uncomfortable anyway.  She quickly gathered her briefcase and papers that she had been trying to look over and paid her bill.  She took one step out the door and glanced around for the man..he was nowhere to be seen.  Relieved, she started walking down the sidewalk, eyes open for a taxi.  

A peel of thunder echoed on the buildings and the night skies opened.  In the blink of an eye, Sora was soaked through, her sheath dress and jacket clinging to her skin.  She raked her short hair from her eyes, shaking her head at it all.  A taxi took pity on her and pulled over at her hail.  She opened the door and started to explain in her broken English where she wanted to go, but the man behind the wheel was not adept at English either and wasn't understanding her.  At that moment the latch of her briefcase chose to spring open and have it's contents spilled to the ground, just missing the little river of water at the curb.  Swearing under her breath at her luck for her first night in the United States, she crouched in her heels to gather her papers and was startled to see another's hands helping her.  She glanced up to meet the gaze of the young man who had watched her through the window.  Recognition flickered in her almond eyes, and it was reflected in his pale blue ones.  Sora knew him for a predator, and he knew her for the same.  He collected the rest of her things, handing them to her and she stuffed them haphazardly into her briefcase, making sure to lock the latch this time.  When she straightened, the man was speaking to the driver, giving him the directions to the hotel she had been trying to request.  He stepped aside, holding the door for her, closing it gently as the taxi started to pull away.  She turned to glance out the window at the man, a nod of thanks all there was time for."

Her knees buckled and she grasped the arms that appeared to support her.  His eyes met hers, pity pouring out of them.  She immediately tore her eyes from his gaze and pushed him away, to stand on her own, the pity burning her.  It was not pity she needed, it was understanding.  Understanding of the gaping hole left in her soul that appeared with the news.  The words rang in her ears as she turned and stood up straight, making her way steadily from the room <i>""...attacked...fell to his beast...gone...sorry...""</i>  As she crossed the threshold she pulled every bit of horror and grief she felt and pushed it as far from her mind and heart as she could. It was grief as she had never felt, grief that would over take her if she gave it even a thought."

"event","She closed the car door behind her, looking at the house that she had once called home.  It was as she remembered it, down to the Beast being parked in the garage.   She walked around to the back of the house, smiling as she saw traces of the plants they had landscaped with; apparently Jose was still tending the grounds.

The moon reflected off the still surface of the pool, the only source of light in their dark backyard.  It was still, even the crickets seemed to notice the ominous feeling pressing out from the vacant house.  She paused at the back door, amused with herself that it was still habit to not use the front door.  Placing her hand on the knob that would lead into the kitchen, she hesitated, bracing herself for what she would find inside.  

She stepped into the darkness and debris from the now-broken-glass fronted cabinets crunched under her feet.  She flipped the switch on the wall to reveal the destroyed room...glass and kitchen utensils thrown about, every cupboard and the refrigerator opened and turned out onto the floor.  She picked her way across the mess, wincing as she felt a vase go skidding from her path and careen against a wall.  It shattered, joining its sisters in the mess.

She walked through the downstairs of the house..everything was similar: broken glass, broken furniture, books and video tapes strewn about, ripped to shreds.  It had been as Frank had described to her, Chris had torn everything apart.  She had tried to ignore Frank's requests for her to return to Las Vegas, tried to tune them out, believe that his stories weren't true...  

She had known, deep down, but she had stood firm and stayed in Ireland.  She had told herself she would not be treated that way anymore,that it was too much to take any longer.  Countless conversations had and promises made.  All of them broken sooner or later.  She could feel the burn of his words in her head, the promises, the pleading, the oaths of love for her.  She had given him many chances before, but finally it was too much.  She had left, knowing that in the depths of his soul he did in fact love her the way he claimed, but that any promise he made to her would be broken.  It always had been...always would be.  

Righting the few pieces of furniture that were still intact, she made her way to the library he had built for her their first Christmas in the house.  It was in a little better shape that the rest of the rooms...cluttered, but not as touched by the rage he felt at one moment or another.  Judging by the paths in the dust, he had been in here several times after destroying it.  

She placed a few books on the shelves, smiling at the flitting memories some of the books still held.  She busied herself as long as she could, putting books on shelves, straightening the furniture, fixing the desk and putting papers back where they went.  She retrieved a broom and dust pan from a hall closet and worked on cleaning up the rest of the library.  She vacuumed and placed the last rug, looking at her achievement.  Only a couple of hours.  She laughed at herself, at this rate, she'd have the house ready in a week instead of the three days she'd given herself.  Taking the overflowing trash can out of the room, she considered just overturning it onto the floor in the kitchen and how satisfying that would be, but then thinking better of it: it would mean more mess later, she took it out to the larger receptacle outside.  

Putting the trash can down, she looked up at the sky and sighed.  How did it ever get to this point?  Why on earth hadn't she listened to William in the first place?  And for the life of her, she still couldn't figure out why Chris had the affect her the way he did.  She picked up the trash can and headed back inside.  May as well keep working...she wanted to do as much on her own as she could without Jeff there.  He was the last thing she needed right now.

Once inside she made her way upstairs, glancing into the rooms and avoiding the one that used to be theirs.  Nothing was any more amiss up here than it had been down there.  She stopped in the hallway, only a few feet away from the door, but unable to see in.  She didn't want to go in there.  Goosebumps sprung out on her neck and arms, a coldness started creeping from her stomach.  The rest of the house may have been ok, but she wasn't ready for this.  She took a step backward, away from the door.  At the same time the kitchen door slammed shut and a voice came booming through the house ""Let's go, Tits. He's waiting for you at the Venetian.""  Forgiving him for the horrid nickname he insisted on for her, she hurried down the stairs, ready to be out of there."

Depression had been an odd thing for her, even before her embrace.  But this time, it had settled in deep, down into her core.  Rolling over, she ignored her hunger and let the emotion driven sleepiness wash over her."

""It's on the kitchen table, like always, Tits,"" Came his smart ass reply from the living room, even though he knew she'd been waiting for, hoping for, a letter, a postcard, a rock.  Something.  She sighed with frustration and went to the kitchen.

Grabbing up the pile of mail, she sorted quickly, eyes scanning the handwriting on each letter.  Fighting the tears of anger and worry, she went through each envelope again, hoping she had just missed it in her rush.  Nothing.

Her shoulders slumped and a sigh escaped her lips as the mail was very carefully placed back on the table instead of thrown.  Nothing.  No letter, no phone call.  Either he was in terrible trouble or he'd forgotten her....the thought brought a little smile, but it faded quickly as she let herself remember it had been over two weeks since thier last contact.   Not like him to not even leave a rock on her doorstep to let her know he was ok.

What if they had found him?

Running her hand through her hair, she started toward the library, her jaw set with determination.  It was time to plan.  The hard work started now."

"event","The journey here from Michigan was uneventful, luckily enough.  The car trip was a little long, but with all of the electrical problems on the east coast, it was worth the hassle.  I'd rather travel for 11 hours than wonder if my plane will be allowed to land and what will happen if I did.

Jake met up with me at the hotel (I must say, Jeff did a splendid job of selecting one this time and even remembered to put Jake's name on the room...maybe he's getting over his jealousy?) and we left for the gathering in Mystic shortly after he arrived.  It was nice to see Jake relaxed and not on ""a mission"".   I wish I could see that side of him more often.  We greeted many familiar faces as we entered and shortly after, as usual, each of us was called off to various private conversations.

Angelo immediately sought me out and escorted me to the far end of the ballroom, all the while talking in my ear about various gossip and would I please help Lord Patronious the following night by presenting Prince Edge at the Cotillion? When asked why I was needed he was quick to respond ""You are a well known and respected member of the Brujah clan....""  I think he really meant that I was the only female brujah present and that it was tradition to be paired up male/female.  Lord Patronious was very kind and gracious as he explained and made his request of me, which of course I didn't turn down.  Leaving him to converse with the others, I ran smack dab into the chest of a rather large man in a blue cloak, I excused myself and slipped past, not quite making mental note of the smile and the ""Of course, Ms. Bedford.""

From across the room, Devin grinned at me and who can resist such an invitation to harass him?  I walked over and after the usual commentary, was introduced to Edge, a member of our clan.  I almost laughed.  This boy was the prince that I was going to present?  What a pair we would make standing in front of all the older, wiser, and important members of our society.  I spoke with the two of them at length before seeing Jake at a rare moment of solitude, which I took advantage of, for it is not often we get to spend time together at a social function.  It lasted an entire 5 minutes before Richard Crane and Devin found us.  It is always delightful to see Richard, I adore him, and I never know what to expect to come out of his mouth!  This time, it was when Tess Parker came up and there was banter about tango lessons and Seneca that he declared Tess should be called ""Prince Luuuv.""

Saisha invited me to howl at the moon with him, I accepted, and was amused at the crest fallen face as I returned to the party instead of staying with him.  I came across Lexi McKeane, who has been into things I hope to never set foot in.  Something has happened to her...she looks different from when I saw her last at the Fireside.  Being near her gave me the creeps.

The last surprise of the evening was the man in the blue cape.  Oded, face to face.  I was quite surprised to see him there, let alone to have the chance to speak with him at length.  He is not very different from speaking with him online, though a little intimidating.  Topics ranged from enjoying the party to the important people present to what happened in Buffalo.  He didn't seem pleased to learn that Seneca may be attending the Cotillion.  I will have to make a point to ask him about his sire tomorrow.

As Jake and I were leaving, Devin introduced me to Anwar.  A beautiful creature, even if she is a bit shy. From the way that Devin gazes upon her, I'd say he's been twitter-pated. More observations on that subject tomorrow.  For now, time to finally be alone with Jake."

It has come to my attention that stories written here (which are oc info and for entertainment purposes only) are being used in game.  I'm not accusing anyone, for i don't know exactly how it's being done...but it's got to stop.  Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed the posts I did.

"event","Ordinary Day
by Vanessa Carlton


Just a day,
Just an ordinary day.
Just tryin to get by.
Just a boy,
Just an ordinary boy.
But he was looking towards the sky.
And as he asked if I would come along
I started to realize-
That everyday you find 
Just what he's looking for,
Like a shooting star he shines.

He said take my hand,
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams are right in the palm of your hand

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel
For I felt what I had not felt before
You'd swear those words could heal.
And I as looked up into those eyes
His vision borrows mine.
And to know he's no stranger,
For I feel I've held him for all of time.

And he said take my hand,
Live while you can
And if we walk now we will divide and conquer this land.
Don't you see your dreams are right in the palm of your hand
Right in the palm of your hand

Please come with me,
See what I see.
Touch the stars for time will not flee.
Time will not flee.
Can you be

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream.
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that boy, that ordinary boy.
Or was it all in my head?
Did he asked if I would come along
It all seemed so real.
But as I looked to the door,
I saw that boy standing there with a deal.
And he said he my take my hand,
Live while you can,
Don't you see your dreams are right in the palm of your hand
Right in the palm of your hand
Right in the palm of your hand

Just a day, just an ordinary day
Jus tryin to get by.

Just a boy, 
Just an ordinary boy.
But he was looking to the sky.





a perfect song for him"

also..the whole song thing..it's true.  Matter of fact, I've been struggling to find a new line up of Cori music for her intro..this past wednesday I heard three of ""her"" songs in a row on the radio, all by themselves between commercial blocks. Needless to say, they became the openers :)  RL is so weird sometimes..."

"event","Tonight I was greeted at the fireside with a sudden silence...the kind where you know you've walked into a conversation that was about you, or at least not for your ears.  I looked around and gave Alexia a questioning look, she came over to hug me and told me I should speak with Grim.  I reluctantly did so.  He told me he had news, news that he had requested he give to me and would be hard to hear.  

Seth was killed the night before, fighting someone for his family.

Instant numbess spread over me. I didn't know whether to scream or cry or laugh. I still don't. 

Now as I sit and write this, there is a calm washing over me, sorrow is still deep and will be for a long time, but an odd sense of calmness is on the surface. Perhaps just the thoughts of him affect me as his presence did.

Annelle's card reading echos in my head:  ""There will be a dark haired school boy...not in age...but in his actions...there will be a great sadness and you will discover he isn't the one that is fated for you.""  

As I look over my other entries that Seth managed to sneak into, it is more and more apparent that perhaps Annelle's reading rings true, or perhaps it is just my fancy, much like the song that played when Grim's words sunk in tonight. 

Maybe it is my imagination..maybe not. I dont know.  I do know that I miss him..and I'm going to go seek the solace of a dead tree."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
Chasing after you


I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hangin by a moment here with you


Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me now


I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving in to
I'm hanging by a moment here with you


There's nothing else to lose
There's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world
That could change my mind
There is nothing else..."

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces passed
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making my way
Through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder....

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever 
Think of me

'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in your
Precious memories

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder....

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
Tonight

And I, I
Don't want to let you know
I, I
Drown in your memory
I, I
Don't want to let this go
I, I
Don't....

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces passed
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making my way
Through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder....

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you...

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
If I could 
Just hold you
Tonight"

If you could only see the way she loves me

If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Well you got your reasons
And you got your lies
And you got your manipulations
They cut me down to size

You give your love but you won't

Show's happiness unraveled
And you got to take a little dirt
To keep what you love
That's what you gotta do

Sayin' you love but you don't
You give your love but you won't
You're stretching out your arms to something that's just not there
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

Even if it's a lie 
Say it will be alright 
And I will believe 

Broken in two 
I know you're on to me 
That I only come home 
When I'm so all alone 
But I do believe. 

That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right 
It all comes down on me 
Please say honestly you won't give up on me 
And I shall believe I shall believe. 

Open the door 
And show me your face tonight 
I know it's true 
No one heals me like you 
And you hold the key. 

Never again Would I turn away from you 
I'm so heavy tonight 
But your love is alright 
And I do believe. 

Please say honestly 
You won't give up on me 
And I shall believe 
I shall believe

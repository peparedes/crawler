"event","I realised today that, as I was alone all day at work, and then when I got home I went to bed before Gavin got home, and didn't call anyone apart from Gav, I went a whole day with only talking to a handful of people at work about work or the banal pleasantries that pass for the phone conversations I have with Gav when we're tired and cranky. ""Buy bread"" and the like.

This is the future, people.

This is what my life has become.

Yey. 

<lj-cut text=""Song!!"">

(Hyperballad by Bjork)

We live on a mountain
Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain
Every morning I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around

It's become a habit
A way
To start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks

When it lands
Will my eyes
Be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

ETA I just realised how self-contradictory I am. I complained last week of being surrounded by too many people, this week I'm complaining about having no people. I'm so impossible to be!"

"event","I met up with my mate Dan (from IntMed) the other night so he could introduce me to the people I'll be working with at my new job. They seemed OK. The one woman seemed really arsey though. And the one girl was the spitting image of Winona Ryder, which was pretty cool. I left kinda early though cus I was really bored / tired. I am really nervous about my new job, but that's natural. 

I feel like I haven't stopped for weeks, been going home every weekend off for whatever reason so haven't had any time alone. It's making me a bit frazzled and fried.

I am looking forward to my 3 day weekend next week, going to go to the UK web and mini comics thing with Mike on the Saturday, then I plan to see Ana's play on the Sunday. I'm hoping to have my leaving thing for work on the Friday but I've not made any special arrangements for that. 

As for this weekend, tomorrow I actually have off and as long as Gav doesn't call in sick I'll be able to be by myself to decompress. Being surrounded by people constantly gives my such a high level of anxiety, I need to just be alone and ignore everyone for a while. I'm working Saturday morning so I can go to his sister's birthday thing on the night, then I'm working Sunday night.

I'm a bit addicted to Katy Perry at the moment. I'm not going to be ashamed."

"event","What a weekend. I got in from work around midnight the friday and was out again 8am the next day, got to my moms and went out for my haircut, then met with Aaron and walked to Asda to meet Ems, went to hers and got PISHED. Like, sooo drunk there are times of the night that are a complete and horribly empty blur... so, I don't think I will be doing that again soon. I'm still feeling kinda rough now so it's obvious that my body cannot handle nights like that anymore - i'm too old. BUT there were times that I had a really good time, and I felt really pretty. I also remember nearly losing a shoe cus the dance floor was just THAT sticky. Ew. 

But it has been agreed that the next time I see emms we are going to do something civilised. And when we do go clubbing together (because, at the end of the day, we both like to dance and that's why we go) we are NOT going to drink beforehand.

But I've handed my notice in now.

I tell her she could try switching to ITV, our subtitles were much better than the BBC. She said no, she didn't like ITV. So I googled RedBee and gave her their switchboard number. Shouldn't really do that, but meh.

I went in for a check up and my wisdom teeth are all kinda messed up. When I went in 6 months ago she drilled some of my wisdom teeth off cus they were sharp and digging into my cheeks, then when I went in today she drilled them some more (the one on the right was basically crumbling, ew) and filled them in again. But she doesn't hold much hope for the one on the right, if it gives me hassle I'm to call and have it yanked out :(

"event","So I got in from Watchmen last night (full frontal in IMAX = awesome, also am crushing on the Comedian a bit but I'm not going to look too much into that... ), pretty late it was, so I didn't stay up much later and fell asleep. I hadn't switched off my alarm that had been set for 4am, so I was rudely awakened a few hours after I went to bed. And, as I am the smart, I heard my alarm and thought that opening my hot water bottle, letting some air into it, and then fastening it again, was the way to switch my alarm off. Yeah... 

So, watchmen. I enjoyed, I will definitely want to see it again, but.... <lj-cut text""spoiler"">no squid?</lj-cut>

Hrumph. 

I'm working til 11:30pm now and back in tomorrow for 7am. I am so tired.

Just finished a very good book, called ""What a carve up!"". It's been out a while but I was just given it as my sis thought i'd like it and I did. So yey. I loved how... I don't know how else to described it, it was coiled in on itself. Also I really want to go to <a href=""http://www.rhythmriot.com/"">this</a> but I don't think anyone would go with me. :( 

The googlemap pop up that I get from typing in my location is always wrong! I am going to have to be less specific..."

My recruitment agent lady gave my positive feedback from the company (Viasat if you're interested) within an hour of the interview. She called the next day to tell me they're putting through request paperwork to Sweden for me, and they're not interviewing anyone else. She said that they have always got the job request come back positively, but there's always a chance that they won't, so I'm not counting my chickens or anything, but yes! New job probably!

<lj-cut text=""I go ahead and count my chickens anyway"">
I will probably be a TV Scheduler. That means I would be creating daily schedules for a channel in Denmark, deciding which promos go with which shows (like, deciding if an advert for Hockey would go better with a live football event or top gear.. it's a channel aimed at men you see) and I'd have access to the ratings to see if my decisions were effective. How fun! Unfortunately it would just be the promos I get to decide, the adverts and the timing of the shows are done by other higher up people, but it's a start! How cool would it be to one day decide if it'd be better to put sex and the city on before or after scrubs?

I am off home tomorrow morning, yey! Can't wait to sleep in the bed at my mom's, it's so comfortable I never wanna get up. 

Finish work at 2 and then I'm gonna to go to Hammersmith on the way home and try to buy some tights. Thrilling? Well, it's the little things and shopping on my way home makes me happy. It's not like I'm buying a car or something. 

It was funny yesterday morning, I was CONVINCED it was my friend Hannah's birthday today, and facebook was down for site maintenance (this was, like, 6am) so I couldn't check! I panic-bought a book on amazon with next-day delivery for her. When facebook came up, I saw that her birthday was the 26th.. of may. SHAME!"

I'm so nervous and tired! I got back from work last night at 12 and was up again at 7 to get into town. And then came straight to work from town. Too much! 

I hate interviews. But I think it's a job I could do quite well? It's scheduling, so a lot more admin then I do here, which I am comfortable doing. And there's a set ladder you can work up.

It would give me my evenings free, which would be lovely.

I actually only read this today, even though he posted the day after my birthday (thanks for the present trent, yah)... because I am teh slow.

Am I upset? A little. You can't listen to a band for over a decade and not feel cheated if they leave. But I can understand, everything's changed so much, I still haven't got Ghosts or The Slip... 

I guess I don't have anything worldly or wise to say about this, I just wanted to put up my own little gravestone.

In other news, I have a cold. Yey.

And I have an appointment tomorrow morning with a Media Recruitment Agency about a job as a scheduler, which funnily enough I know is a job that an old colleague is giving up to go work for the beeb... small world. 

Going home next weekend, gonna see Hannah and Ems on the Friday and Jo on the Saturday, going to meet her tattooist and talk about a cover-up. It would be so awesome to have my arm sorted out :) 

I am currently obsessed with Ace of Cakes and want to re-train as a cake decorator... I am trying to find a sugarcraft course or cake decorating course in the evenings to do but not having any luck finding any nearby. If not a wise career move, at least it would be a fun (and tasty) hobby!"

Well, you know, it was OK. But I got use to birthdays being AWESOME and then anything less than that = suck. I postponed my party, so that Jo could come, and also because I'd had such a shit week that I was in no mood for a party.

My mom and dad came down yesterday and took me to lunch in Richmond, which was nice of them to visit, but it makes me sad when they go again. 

I was watching ace of cakes last night and kinda fell in love with the idea of being a cake decorator. But I'm easily suggestible so I might not like the idea tomorrow. I am still gonna google what you have to do to be a cake decorator to see if it's something I could do."

I've been a busy wedding bee during my time off from work. I've confirmed with the caterer that we'll be going with them, I've arranged for us to meet a photographer, I've finalised the revised booking times at the venue (needed changing because of caterers), I've got the wedding insurance, I've ordered the first drink wine (3 crates for 85 quid, an expensive round I think you'll agree .. maybe not that much for London though!!) and we've ordered our rings which should get here next week! Eeeee!

Alas! I am conflicted about transport. (only a bride can say that with as much enthusiasm as I have). It's like, because our ceremony and reception are in the same place, and because I'll be coming from close by, I just don't see the point of getting a posh car. But at the same time, wouldn't it be awesome to drive up in a big ass Cadillac? But you can't get something like that for one 2 1/2 mile journey. I think I'll be happy in just a black cab. I think. And the flowers! I love my paper flowers that I've made so far, but they are really tricky to make, and I don't know if I can be arsed with making any more, and I'm not sure how to arrange them if I do make more. SIGH!

I think, wedding wise, I am totally up to speed. I was having internal dramas with my dress, as in me maybe changing my mind by being tempted with more traditional wedding dresses, but that's more about me not wanting people to look at me and think 'that's not a wedding dress! why isn't she wearing a wedding dress?? doesn't she know it's her wedding??!!' ... but screw them. I really think my dress is pretty. Being tempted by new shoes though, although that would mean I'd need another something borrowed. And I still need to sort out a hat!! 

Oh yeah, Gav's OK with wedding stuff too. We picked a suit and he looked very dashing. He's gonna keep his long hair but tie it back (yum) and he's gonna wear converse with the suit after the ceremony, which will look totally cute.

I got gall stones, and I am gonna get my gall bladder removed. Luckily most cases they do it key-hole style. I have to wait to see a(nother) doc in June, and then we'll see when I can get it out. Until then, I am on a strict low-no fat diet, figuring out what causes me pain to eat and what doesn't. Turns out, most meals cause me pain. Yey! I've found out that if I eat more than 7g fat per meal then it hurts me. (Keep in mind, a healthy diet is 70g fat per day). If I bend down too much it hurts me too.

So I was at work and it was my wedding that afternoon. I was wearing blue baggy-ish jeans and a black t-shirt, and I was going to the wedding. Gavin had picked my dress and the venue like in the show... except he didn't have a dress! And the venue, at that same time there was a wedding of a girl at school (not specified which one) and all these people from my school were her guests so no one came to mine! So I was freaking out about getting married in jeans so Jeremy Clarkson (sigh) came and drove me into town to buy one (Town being Bloxwich?). When I got back the food had arrived (deep-friend cheese sandwiches??) but Gavin had gone! I remember saying to someone 'I don't care about the food! I just care about Gavin!' and then I woke up.

... Nice to see the school theme remains in my anxiety dreams."

Well, nothing much has been going on. I got my hours here, which means I am not going home for christmas day yet again, but I can make it up on the 27th so it'll be a late christmas for me. Which means I will be home to see the tree up and all that, yey! And also to do a bit of the january sales. :)

The other day I was in my kitchen and I was making a snack, and i noticed some crumbs in the bread bin that looked kinda.. dodgy. I went in for a closer look, and they looked alright, but i decided to wipe around all the edges just to be clean. SO i'm cleaning up and .... I found a small white grubby maggotty bug thing. IN MY BREAD BIN WHERE I GET MY BREAD FROM THAT I EAT. And anyone that knows me, knows how clean I like to keep things, so i was absolutely horrified. Suffice to say, that bread bin got thrown straight out. I'm I'm still kinda horrified about it all. I am buying a new breadbin today. A metal one! 

Also I've tried making my first flower that'll be used as buttonholes and for the bouquets. I think I can do it but I'm not happy about the middle, the guide online said to have some feathered paper but I think that looks kinda rubbish when I do it, so I'm going to make another one tonight using a big button as the centre. Kinda cool huh? I'll post pictures once they're made. Oh! I need to buy some florist tape from somewhere. Or get some from my mom if there's any left over from the shop.

That's about it :)"

"event","Well, I booked the registrar for the wedding - that's going to cost 275 quid there - which is annoying 'cus I thought that was included in the price of the room. SO basically we've got this beautiful room, which is costing us 550 quid for the 1 hour - plus nearly 300 on top of that! Ouch! We've got to go give our notice to marry next week, I thought it was a bit early to be doing that but apparently we have to do it within the next 3 weeks or we loose our registrar slot. And that costs 30 quid each too.

I've been really bad with the whole not smoking thing, in that I've been smoking again. whoops. I blame Conor. All his fault! And my own addiction-thing too, of course. I'll be better though.

Jo and Spig and Timo were visiting the weekend just gone, they had a shitty transport situation either way for jo and spig, which i feel completely responsible for as I was the one that suggested going through southall. :( but apart from that it was great having them both visiting. And it was great seeing timo again too - even though it felt really brief. We went to Old Orleans for food on the Saturday night, I had ribs and chicken and my chicken was basically a chicken nugget.. but the ribs were really nice. Spig ordered something with an egg on it - and they had no eggs or something so his food was late, but we all got a free drink to say sorry, so it all worked out! 

As it's friday, it's a pub day at work, so I'll be going to the pub soon. I've only got 3 full days left, and 2 evening shifts. then I'm off! it's so scary, starting at a new place. I hope I like it.

HELEN'S TOP INAPPROPRIATE 1ST DANCE SONGS! SO FAR!

(this list is not exhaustive!!)

Inbetweener - Sleeper (""He's not too special, She's not too smart..."")
Stupid Kid - Alkaline Trio (""Remember when I said I love you, Well forget it I take it back!"")
I Write Sins Not Tragedies - PANIC! At The Disco (""what a shame, the poor groom's bride is a whore"")
Stolen Sidewalk - Bif Naked (""I'm a junkie, I'm a whore, That's what you always called me..."")
She's Got Issues - Offspring (""I'm seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind..."")

And that's what I do with my time at work. :p

Martha Stewart is sick. (My Martha, that is.) She's got fin rot. I've given her medicine and put in extra stuff and everything so we just have to wait and see. She was more energetic than she has been after giving her medicine, so fingers crossed. 

In other news, I had another dream about going out with Jeremy Clarkson. Damn you Dave, damn you and your top-gear repeats. I think this is surely developing into a ""thing"". This time I was working on top gear, and some other girl got to go on the show, and I was all to Jeremy (in bed, mind) ""But I work so hard Jeremy, why can't I be on the show?"" and ... well I won't go into details but, yeah. :)"

"event","I had a fantabulous weekend. The national wedding show was so overwhelming awesome. I tried on this one dress that stood up by itself it was that huge, and I got ideas for favours and stuffs.

<lj-cut text=""gavin is not to click! this it's about the dress!"">
So yeahsum, we also found the dress!! It's being actually made for me, a one off! The lady was so nice, I never thought I'd get a dress made for me, but it's true what they say, when you know it's the dress, you just know. I tried on the one that was similar and was so happy with the colour, and she altered it with pins to get the right length (tea-length I think) and that was just that. It's a deep blue-green (my favourite colour) and it's gonna have a black ribbon under the bust and a bit of black tulle underneath so it poofs out. My mom's also paying for it which is amazing of her. JOY!! I don't think it's important that it's not white, I really didn't want a white or off-white dress, that's so dull. 
</lj-cut>

I hung out with jo at spigs on the night which was great to catch up, and I stayed with my mom on the Sunday before getting the coach back (I got my favourite seat and I didn't sit next to anyone and was early so that was a pretty good journey all in all). 

I got my <a href=""http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/0,39030106,49291975,00.htm"">new phone</a> too this weekend, and I'm pretty happy with it. 5 mega pixels! I have a better camera then that obv, but it's still so small. It plays music too but I've not bothered with that cus I've got an mp3 player. 

There's an alarm going off somewhere and I don't know where but it's soooooo annoying. And my boss came in to talk about something and turned my radio off!! I am so turning it back on now. 

That's about all the news I can think of..."

"event","Called my mom last night, she might be able to make my dress for me, how awesome is that? That would be such a load of my mind! Also my dad said he was sorry, talking to my mom after that she said he's been stressed because my sister is back with Phil (ass) and all that stuff. So maybe he will come to the Wedding after all? Don't really want him walking me down the aisle though. As it's a civic ceremony we might get away with that not happening at all anyway. 

Looking forward to my trip up home this weekend, I hope the weather cheers up because I want to go to the car-boot... there are always card-craft stalls and I want to see if I can get cheap envelopes etc. 

All the work is done at work and i am soooo seriously bored!! I'm gonna kill time by looking at dresses. :)"

OK I'm stopping going on about it now.

It was my interview today... I think it went OK- I'd be happy if I got it but wouldn't be surprised if I don't. Plus it's not in the best area ever, an industrial estate, yuk. So I'll wait and see. A couple of weeks max. 

Gav went over to his mom's last night and they talked guest list etc. Nothing much was resolved, she seems pretty upset that we're not getting married in a church, it seems. I don't know. 

It is, however, mince pie season again. :)"

"event","York house was in the original Alfie, it's the sanatorium where Alfie recuperated. Isn't that fascinating?"

"event","Gav and I had a brilliant time this weekend looking at venues. It was very successful in that we NOW HAVE A VENUE BOOKED AND THEREFORE A DATE!!

:) Our first place was York house as I said, which was perfect. The guy showing us around was so friendly and helpful, went through everything we should know, gave us tips for getting it cheaper and really went all out for us. We really were impressed by the size of the hall, and how elegant the reception room was... even if it is the same place my cousin got married in, but I'm sure that won't matter. 

On Saturday we went to the places in Ealing but I really wasn't too fussed.. the Princes Hall was horribly laid out, and the other rooms we saw were either too big/school-hall like or too small. The Pitzhanger Manor House was really elegant and pretty but we could not see how 72 people were supposed to fit in it, it seemed really too small for the cost. So, we've decided to go with York House. (yey!) 

We were talking about dates and prices and it'd cost us over a grand more to have the wedding on a Saturday instead of in the week, so we thought autumn half term holiday would be the best bet as it's still the season I want and the kids wouldn't need any time off school.. They only do Friday weekdays soo the Friday of Autumn half term holiday it is. ... That's the 31st October. I'M GETTING MARRIED ON HALLOWEEN!!! I phoned up myself and made a provisional booking all by myself (which is a big deal for me, I hate phoning places) so I am quite pleased. 

I'm not a goth, though. 

I am so very very happy. :)

Now I can start really planning, I think. Just under a year t"

"event","Schedule of events!

Tonight at 8.30 we're going to look at <a href=""http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/community_and_living/birth_marriage_and_death/marriage/marriage_venues/york_house_weddings.htm"">York House</a> in Twickenham. Tomorrow at 11 we're going to look at <a href=""http://www.ealing.gov.uk/services/community/community_venues/hall_hire/large_halls/princes_hall/"">Princes Hall</a> in Ealing, and then after at 1 we're going to look at <a href=""http://www.ealing.gov.uk/services/leisure/museums_and_galleries/pm_gallery_and_house/rooms_for_hire/"">Pitzhanger Manor-House</a>. 

I am soooo excited about those places! Aren't they pretty? If the York House one does turn out to be the same place as Connel's then my hopes are for the Pitzhanger for ceremony and Princes Hall for reception. 

We also might be going to look at <a href=""http://www.oldactonians.co.uk/oa/clubs/social/hire.xml"">the old actonians</a> and <a href=""http://www.westmiddxgolfclub.co.uk/sitechapter.cfm?chapter=4"">west middlesex golf club</a>, which is the last last last over-my-dead-body options but kinda being guilted into it (guess who by?). I don't like the look of either of those places but they are cheap, I guess. Still don't want to have the reception in either of those places so if I can work it, I'm not going to either. Yuk.

I spoke to my mom and she said my dad was being like that because of stress. Screw him. Jo (my best friend and maid of honour)'s dad said he'd give me away if needs be. :)

It's pretty quiet at work surprisingly enough... My interview at the new place is in a few days and I think I have my outfit sorted and then it's just a case of wowing them with my mad skillz."

"event","I phoned up a venue! All by myself! I was so proud of myself. We're going to go see the <a href=""http://www.ealing.gov.uk/services/community/community_venues/hall_hire/large_halls/princes_hall/"">Princes Hall in Ealing</a> on saturday, which is our cheapest-but-more-people-can-come venue. And i think it has potential. It does mean more hassle booking the caterers and the entertainment ourselves (magicians anyone?) but worth it as 200 people could come, which would sort out guest list hassle.  

I'm feeling better now - I don't need to care about negative people. 

My newest load of paper samples has been dispatched. When I am happy about a design I'll post it online.. exciting!!"

"event","My dad's not coming to my wedding. I had a horrible (albeit short) conversation on the phone with him last night when I was trying to get to my mom (who was out). I started by saying I thought we'd found a venue, and my dad was all 'oh, i hate all this wedding rubbish, why don't you just go to the registry office in isleworth and get it over with' me: 'but i don't live in isleworth anymore' 'oh, wherever it is you live then' ... and then he started telling me how it should just be me and Gavin and some strangers on the street ""just to get it over with"" which i was genuinely hurt by. my sister texted me a bit later and said 'did dad tell you he's not coming to your wedding??' as they'd talked about it.. i just replied with 'at least now i don't have to tell him i don't want him walking me down the aisle' (I'm not a commodity!) ... so that's that then. Also Gav's granddad won't come if it's not in a church, but that's hopefully not going to be the case if Gav's aunt/uncles have anything to do with it.

Add that to the venue in Twickenham that I liked possibly being the same place my cousin Connel got married (How awful is it that I can't remember? I remember the hotel we stayed at but not where the wedding itself was.. bad me), and I don't know if that's just rubbish if we have it in the same place. I might be able to get away with it.. we're going to look at it on Saturday. 

It's like, when we first got engaged everyone was happy, but now everyone is just being so uncooperative."

"event","Well, last night was fun :s Gav was on the phone for what seemed like hours arguing with him mom over our wedding plans. My first choice for a wedding was eloping to Vegas for years, but kinda knew that wasn't gonna happen, so I'd have been happy with a small, intimate, but still none the less pretty wedding but I don't think that's gonna happen any time soon. 

Back to the drawing board I suppose. 

Last night I dreamt I was having a lesbian wedding with one of my bridesmaids. That was interesting."

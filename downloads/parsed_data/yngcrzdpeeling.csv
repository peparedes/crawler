"event","first off, dramatha, gurl fran, i need to find you on facebook. i miss talking to you on here, but i don't get on here as often and i'd like to keep in touch.

I moved from Dallas to Wichita Falls. I'm living here with my gf.
not at all what i thought it would be, but life never really is.
waiting sooooo long for my dental assisting certificate to come in has me real down. Not working just really depresses me.

there's alot going on that i don't even know how to write about. i hardly ever write anymore, maybe that's what's going on with me lol.

my life isn't horrible, or bad, or anything of the sort. But i don't know how to handle this reality. this life. i've never felt some vulnerable. so on the edge. i've never been so dependent, and i hate it. 

my father is about to go to prison, and my gf wants to fuck other people...monogamy is such a funny thing i suppose. i wish i could find it.

i'm having a hard time establishing guide lines, rules, etc of what is and what is not acceptable within a relationship.  for some reason we just can't seem to get on the same page. i don't really know what's happening. i'm writing it off as an adjustment period, and my gf being young and out of control. i really do love her. if i didn't, god knows i'd be gone."

"event","life is going.
responsibility is not something i love, but who does?

i miss the old me some times, but i feel a lot better now.

i do still want to get off of my meds some times and just write.  so much has happened, so much has changed. but it isn't bad at all. that's not what i'm saying.

this isn't as popular as it once was, but to the few that do still read, i actually want to get married. it's a mind blowing thing for me some times still.

i hate how medication does kind of kill my soul. but this world kills me without it, so not writing is the lesser of the two evils. 


I'm a certified dental assistant now, i'm trying to try. i haven't made it by my own standards yet, but i'll settle for the low bar society throws up there until i can climb a little higher.

i'm going to have time to be more creative from time to time now. i'm out of school for a while. but this holiday season is busy. i despise the bussle of the holidays. i'd be so much easier if we weren't such a transient society at times. but i love to travel.

i haven't typed on a actual key board in a while, just my blackberry. so i have been typing a ""z"" along with every "".""   haha, it's fucking me up.

the world is a good place today."

You took my hand so easily
Did you not feel the Devil behind me?
I wrapped my arms around your neck and held you tight
It was easier to slip on your noose
The love you thought was illuminating your soul
Was my mouth setting you on fire
The embers of words burn you beautifully
when i kiss my lips to yours i can smell smoke
how i can go for hours is no mistake
your numbness is no coincidental
i'm slowly taking you apart
it's much easier to sell the pieces back to you
you are such a beautiful mess
my mouth waters with the anticipation of dragging you down
my foot will break your fall
along with the pieces of your self respect
broken dreams shine so bright on your scars of self loathing
looks like you've been busy
don't worry my angel
i'll bare the burden of that load for you
you can scream his name all you want
no one can hear you
just you, and me
when your veins run dry
is when you will be free
the ground is the only destination for those running from themselves
i'm glad you signed up
my smile sealed the deal
now, put your seat in the upright position
lock your tray table
i have no intentions of you returning
i've already sold tickets for the show
it's easier to watch someone else be torn to pieces
than to look in a mirror.


i wrote that a few days ago, and changed it alot from the page to here, they never feel finished...


in other news, i just want to be kissed. oh my god, i miss the taste of your mouth...i wonder if i'll get to be there again? who knows what this life holds. i just miss having you (by ""have"" i meant having sex)"

i had a thought bubble, but it floated off. 
i'm not the same person i once was.

i was searching for the names of all 40 of the african countries. coincidently enough i came upon a website statistics. numbers of HIV/AIDS, oil consumption, natural gas consumption, etc.  and at the bottom of the community it had a forum with the above question as the subject.    needless to say it kind of got to me on a personal level. i can not speak for the military, nor on behalf of it.  but i have friends that get deployed everyday. almost everyone that gets deployed on this base goes through our office. we have to do their dental clearances. the point being ( i got off topic) people, young, very young people are over ther fight, and dieing with inadequate armor and weaponry as is. my friend jason had to take kevlar off of his dead fellow coreman and put it on himself to stay protected under enemy fire. the military in general is going through a process that has left us crucial in #'s. we can't afford to lose anymore. i'm not saying i agree with the course of action that has been taken. but i will support my fellow armed forces members where ever that may be.

the wind, and rain were horrible. wind was 112+mph
pretty fucking bad in that aspect.  but besides trees falling down nothing really happened.

typhoon parties own.
so do hooka parties.

thank you for the concern, i really do appreciate it much. *hugs*"

sometimes i believe you when you say such sweet things.
then i remember who you are
and the things you did to those that cared
in after thought i'm kind of glad the methelated kid stalks you sometimes.
maybe that's karmas flu for you to be sick with.

work is awesomely draining and beautifully busy. i love it.
life...i'll get back to you later on that one, but nothing bad.
p.s. i miss cuddling


p.p.s. SAM, be careful i had a dream that you were pregnant and your face was painted like the cheshire cat and you were going to keep the kid and not get married. you wer telling me about it in some sort of trailer somewhere.  it was odd."

"event","last night i dreamed sad dreams.
but this one was highly symbolic.
it was a medley of emotionally pulling instances.
it started out being back home.
we were walking down the main holler (my family and i) and we were logging out the road by the creek side.
i fell in the creek and there was a large deer there. my dad picked me up though.  we continued on about our job. then we walked home.
the next scene was me and sam partying at rachels house. which of course doesn't fly anymore (rachel said she couldn't hang with me b/c i'm too  ""wild"")
we were having me a going away trip b/c i was leaving to go to europe. but we were flying out of louisania b/c i was leaving my car with my mother in louisania.
there's this cruise i was going to go on before i went to europe. boarding occured in this mall in louisania. so i dropped my mom off, and began my vacation. i had this very long escalator ride in order to board. i was holding onto the handle and my feet wouldn't touch. but it was imparitive to hold on b/c this escelator went sideways and almost upside down. just as i thought i was going to fall the escelator stairs turned into a chute, and i was able to slide down into the ship. as soon as my stomach sets foward on the ship a man greets me and tells me my room is 419 (that's my room here) so that was funny to me.  i get to my room and it has two queen beds. one of which is already occupied. not a big deal, but it was taken by jade.  wow...apparently i made god mad at me for something...that's what i was thinking in my head. what kind of fucked up joke. was i there to just lay i nmy bed while her and her bf are there fucking?  it was weird.  made me think alot. i hate that."

it amazes me how one can warp such an instance.
and carry on about it in such a cold manner.
a week and a half ago i was i na very minor wreck with a woman.
since i don't drive and it wasn't my car i have no insurance.
i agreed to pay the damages on the ladys car.
we agreed on small payments at a certain garage.
behind my back she e-mails my commanders saying that i have made no contact and such and how she wants all of my wages to be garnished in order ot pay for her car to be fixed.
this is ridicelous.
i'm hating life at the moment."

"event","hello all, long time no talk
i live in japan now.
it's crazy awesome.
i'll be here for two years, then it's back state side
or i might try to push for somewhere in europe.



just dreaming of you

had some thought
my head is clear
it's time to retreat a bit within myself
it's time to not speak
time for me to grow up
and realize all i need is me
so now i prepare the dreadful goodbye to you
b/c i know that i'll always want to be there
i'm a million miles away
but my heart, eyes, arms, and ears are right there
i know what happens in my absence
i know what's going on
as meaningless as it may seem
i know better
i've never been dumb
i just always chose the paths of self destruction.
i can't help it
i love what isn't the best thing for me
some how or another i suppose i'm subconsciously self destructive
you clean yourself up and make yourself presentable
but it just fucks you over
maybe it's the fact that i can feel it though
maybe it's the revival of the spirit that attracts me to such set sirens.
who knows.
either way i am slowly realizing that you are nothing more than a figment of the inner depths of my heart.
and it's time for me to wake up."

wow.  school isn't exactly a fucking piece of cake, but i manage.
the dorms are bad ass.

this place has an over whelming sense of isolation.
i miss someone sooo fucking much.
it sucks
being here
with no one that you know
in esence we are all seperated from everyone here.
it's nto bad, dont' get me wrong, just the feeling sucks, not the place.

i go to japan. i'm excited as hell but at the sametime i want it ot be over with so i can pursue something else. i'm kind of jumbled, but then again i'm not. my thoughts are jumbled, not me. i miss just doing nothing sometimes. i miss talking until all hours of the night.

"event","*pukes* love and relationships make me get a little sick, sorry about that dear reader.

i now have a car. and i drove the hell out of it yesterday.

first trip: Tomball to sheri's to visit O. well that's a few miles needless to say.

2nd trip: danielle, kiara, alee, & i going from the apartments to southside, which is the hood close to pearland, and back.

3rd trip: danielle, kiara, and i going back to southside to pick up leah.

4th trip: taking leah back to southside this morning. 

all in all roughly 300 miles. and i LOVE it. last night was fucking kick ass. some guys got the crap beat out of them buy the cops in front of us. it was a bit funny, b/c they were some dumb motherfuckers. trying to evaid(sp?) arrest. dumb asses. 

going out for a job on monday with kiara after we drop danielle off. i miss those girls. 

lots of orange juice was drank last night. orange juice so owns.

teens are going to be kids, can't expect them to be serious.

life is deep, but good. i fucking love it. it's kicking my ass and i love it.

i'm not quite ready for august 8th. but i'm getting there."

R-

Reality- a nice idea. but that varies from person to person as to how much we   keep ""in touch"" with.

Red- i liked my red mohawk. i miss my hair.

Ring- something i don't want no my finger for a while.

ready- i AM ready for tomorrow. i'm ready to go.

refreshed- the way i feel when i share a kiss with someone that deserves attention.

retired- a state i want to enjoy with my future wife and our children in italy.

Right wing- a poltical statre of being that despises me.

retarded- to me is the way i behave mahority of the time. 

reply- something we all like to get

rear- i have a big one."

"event","it's a little after 3 am, and i just got home.
i'm eating some leftover pork&beans, and drinking some sugarfree juice, still on a  gross ass diet, haha but i break it every now and then, okay...allof the time, lol.

i got off of work at 10, hung out with don for a while, then helped ron move sheree and destinee in a temp. set up off of highway 6 somewhere, not too bad, it's fairly close to my work. which means...i will be doing some drinking. i almost wish that sheree wasn't pregnant so i could show her around out here. but, this baby will be an awesome thing for her, i dont' know how des will like it though.

i went to the dentist today before work and finished the rest of my root canal. it wasn't bad, now i have my permanent fixture in.

last saturday night i happened to see quite possibly the girl of my desire. OMG...it was such an ocular pleasure tha ti couldn't even speak...ME...speechless, and not b/c of someone akwardly mentioning thing, jsut at her sheer beauty. and it's nto even a "" i have to hit it"" thing. hell i juat want to take her out. and if i'm lucky be able to speaka sentence and get a kiss. that's all, i have simple dreams. hahaha.

you know...things may be fucked up, but hey...i wouldnt' have it anyother way, b/c i love being me. i love the shti hand we get dealt, i may have just a 9 & 3 off suit, but motherfucker i'll play it like i've got pocket aces.

i was going to tell someone i know happy birthday, her birthday was techinally yesterday...but...calling her isn't okay, and i can't send her shit on myspace b/c her gf...so. i'll have to catch her on here another day.   sticky situations. yeah...they happen.

i have a  cellphone once again. so you all can call if you want, and if you lost the number or whatever, just let me know and i'll send it to you.

i was asked this familiar question once ""if you wer stuck ona desert island, and you could only have one person in the world there, who would it be""  and after much deliberation i chose McGyver. if he were to be given a leathermans tool, he could make a speedboat that looks like it came off of the showroom and we could go to fiji. i want to go to fiji one day...anybody want to join me?"

"event","A FEW OF CHUCK'S FAVORITES 
From a list of Chuck Norris' favorite Chuck Norris jokes:

When the boogeyman goes to sleep every night, he checks his closet for Chuck Norris.

Chuck Norris can lead a horse to water and make it drink.

Chuck Norris doesn't read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.

When Chuck Norris does a pushup, he isn't lifting himself up - he's pushing the Earth down.

Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.

There is no theory of evolution. Just a list of creatures Chuck Norris has allowed to live.

Outer space exists because it's afraid to be on the same planet with Chuck Norris.

Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for his left and right legs.

Chuck Norris does not get frostbite. Chuck Norris bites frost.

There is no chin behind Chuck Norris' beard. There is only another fist.

Chuck Norris is so fast, he can run around the world and punch himself in the back of the head.

There is no such thing as global warming. Chuck Norris was cold, so he turned the sun up.

Chuck Norris doesn't wear a watch. He decides what time it is.

Chuck Norris gave Mona Lisa that smile.

Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door.

Chuck Norris is the reason why Waldo is hiding.

Remember the Soviet Union? They decided to quit after watching a Delta Force marathon on Satellite TV.


tonight was going to be okay, then got stressed, the rest of it was down hill. BUT i left when i should have. all comfilict of selfdestructiveness was pretty much avoided."

-i joined another gym, so i can workout at night as well.
-sheree and my sister are moving out here this week. sheree is keeping the baby i  believe
-i found out someone i used to hang out with has tested posetive for 3 STD's, or STI's.  i never wished that upon her, but she's a big ho bag, so it is to be expected, i don't like her anyways. and i sure as hell am glad that i didn't hit it after everybody else did. clean kid right here *points to self*
-i'm glad nobody on ourside was arrested last night. it was all in all a good night.

"event","wow heres a re-cap of my weekend/week so far...

Friday- cell phone got stolen had to go to deputy, a lot of drama, and we didnt go to the game, but had pizza!!! yummy! danielle spent the night 
Saturday- went to mall with danielle and bought some stuff for homecoming, jared's party, cousin had an asthma attack (hes ok now)
Sunday- slept, bored, HW, blah blah blah boring day
Monday- played hooky, slept till 12:30, watched some tv, took a nap, and layed around being lazy (kinda like sunday), basically caught up on sleep
Tuesday- Color Guard practice (uck), got my cell phone back, it ended up to be in Anna-Kay's backpack, which doesnt make ANY sense cuz wouldnt she have seen it sat, sun, or mon? especially mon? but oh well i got my phone back!
Wednesday- HW, wrote amanda a note, and yet another boring afternoon

OMFG! AIM has not been working on my computer for like ever! i need AIM....*cries* anywho...Pre-Festival is this saturday and we dont even have all of the movements on it...and of course mre rossi is being a beotch about it. of course...and we cant miss no practices for family things, but yet not even 2 seconds later she announces that she will be missing saturday's festival due to some old lady turning 80!!! this lady has had enough b-days to last a lifetime! (haha i tried to make a funny...didnt work. bummer.) ugh! *pets puppy* sadie (my puppy for those who dont know her name) has gotten so big! she is like up to my knee now. but she is a brat because she bit my nose earlier...i was being nice and petting her, and there she goes and jumps up and BAM! bites my nose...i was bleeding...dumb dog....yeah so im am boring myself typing this so im gonna go and chat on MySpace...

You're there by my side 
In every way 
I know that you would not forsake me 
I give you my life 
Would not think twice 
Your love is all I need believe me 

I may not say it quite as much as I should 
When I say I love you darling that means for good 
So open up your heart and let me in 

And I will love you 'til forever 
Until death do us part we'll be together 
So take my hand and hold on tight 
And we'll get there 
This I swear

I'm wondering how I ever got by 
Without you in my life to guide me 
Where ever I go the one thing that's true 
Is everything I do I do for you 

I may not say it half as much as I should 
When I say I love you darling that means for good 
So open up your heart and let me in 
And I will love you 'til forever 
Until death do us part we'll be together 
So take my hand and hold on tight 
And we'll get there 
This I swear

So whenever you get weary
Just reach out for me 
I'll never let you down my love 

And I will love you 'til forever 
Until death do us part we'll be together 
So take my hand and hold on tight 
And we'll get there 

And I will love you 'til forever 
Until death do us part we'll be together 
So take my hand and hold on tight 
And we'll get there 
Ohh we'll get there
This I swear

I couldn't tell you why she felt that way, 
She felt it everyday.
And I couldn't help her, 
I just watched her make the same mistakes again.

What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why.
You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind.
Be strong, be strong now.
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

Her feelings she hides.
Her dreams she can't find.
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.
She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.
Yeah,oh

She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
Broken inside.

She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh
She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah


***Sometimes i wonder.. if ne one would miss me if i died***

"event","My fairy-dog-mother is looking out for me today. I had a tummyache and stuff came out both ends all over the house while momma was gone for a year at work. Then miss judy came over and liberated us from the house and I forgot all about it. Then momma finally came back after three years of being gone and let us back in the house, but I was worried about having accidents cause I think that might be grounds for getting sent back to doggie-prison. I worry about that you know. I don't want to do whatever I did many years ago when first-family sent me to doggie-prison. But I got in the house and it smelled all rosy the way momma likes it. Phwew! I have been reprieved! I must go sit by the door and do my job and bark at any other guys who dare to walk by my castle. Aaaarrrooooow! Little dog dug up a rawhide that the buried ten years ago and he says now it's lutefisk but I don't know what that is. It just looks like dirty rawhide to me. Little dog is weird."

"event","Miss Judy has been giving us bones when mamma is at work. Sometimes mamma goes to work for two years and we are starving, so Miss Judy comes and lets us out and gives us bones. Then mamma comes home and acts like she was only gone for part of the day or something.

Little dog keeps taking his bone and burying it and then trying to take mine. What the hell is that about? I think the squirrels might be controlling his mind.

Mamma ate a whole dead cow last night and didn't give me any. I wonder if she's mad at me? I better go kill my Quigley toy and show her that I am a good boy so she'll never do that again! I shall not be deprived! Oh yeah ... that's my butt ... pat my butt ..."

I'm pretty sure those are the words at least ...

Momma took me and little-dog to the big lake again today and we got to see lots of other guys.
She wouldn't let us off the leash though and I don't know why.  I thought that was dumb.  Does she
think she'll get lost if she doesn't have the leash?

Little dog got so excited he started shaking all over and sometimes would bark at other guys.
It was so embarrassing! Why can't he look cool like me?
A couple times just to redeem us I had to try and attack bigger dogs than me.  Momma pulled
me back cause I was still on the leash but I coulda taken 'em! I coulda!"

Little dog has finally stopped humping me so fanatically. Ever since I told him that if he didn't stop I could magically make the cat never poo again.  He didn't like that idea! 

I rock! I am the most feral! I think I hear my pack howling in the distance by the fire station and I must go answer them!"

"event","Momma gave us some big pieces of dead cow while she was home from work for two years for a ""holly-day"".
But then they went away for one year and left us with 2nd mom. I like 2nd mom cause she lets us
do whatever we want and eat lots of cookies. But she is not momma and that makes me sad cause I don't
want momma to leave me and I worry about that a lot.

I ate my dead cow leg all in one bite! I am the king! Aaaaarrrooooooooo!"

"event","Momma is doing that weird thing again that she does every year.  She brings a tree into the house and then gets mad when me and little dog pee on it.  I've been telling little dog over and over again that you pee on those things by lifting your leg (instead of this woosy little squatting girl thing he's been doing), but now Momma gets really mad when he does it on her inside tree.  Momma has a lot of weird ideas.

Then I want to eat.  Plus, when momma comes home from work I want to play.  I wonder how long I have to sleep each day to qualify as hybonation?

"event","This morning I caught one of those little gray bandits that skulk around the perifory of my kingdom. Well, I had him, but then he shed part of his big, fluffy tail and ran away.  I gave the tail to little dog to play with and ran over and watched him try and hid on the other side of the fence.  I was just about to dig under the fence and get to him when Momma came out and was very disturbed about something and told me I had to go inside.  I think she was mad at me cause the gray bandit got away. Dadda took the prize tail away from little dog and threw it away so they must have been very disappointed in me that I was not able to catch him.

Then I had a boring day inside with nothing to do except sleep and tell little dog to leave my paws alone!"

I was wagging my tail as hard as I could in that pattern that says that I must play now because I have not met my play quota yet today but I don't know if she's going to heed my request.

Momma seems to be the only one who understands what I'm trying to say. She even sings with me when we're really happy!

"event","Momma's friend Miss Lisa came over with Mr. Cody tonight. At first I had to stay inside while Mr. Cody met little dog. I think they did that cause they were worried that people would break in the front of the house while they were in the back yard so they needed to me to stand guard. I really wanted to play though! I hope they didn't hear me crying cause that would blow my cover.

Mr. Cody used to be crazy but now he's way more fun! He barks a lot now and doesn't try to attack me like he used to. I was always backed off though cause you know I could kick his butt! Miss Lisa has really good treats! I love Miss Lisa!

Little dog tried to kill my hedgehog today but he doesn't know how to do it right so I had to pounce on him and take the hedgehog away and show him how to give it what for! I will free this house from the wrath of the hedgehog!"

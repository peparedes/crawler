"event","ok so my whole life has pretty much been runined in like a blink of an eye...i never thought that someone could hurt me as much as i have been hurt by her...she just throws my feelings around like they are nothing...she says she is sorry....she says she has relized just how much she loves me ...she says she will never hurt me again but i dont know how to forgive her...i  want to but i cant. my heart is broken and it cant be fixed...how do you know when to say enough is enough and let go...i love her with all of my heart and i want this to work but i fear that it cant, she was my life, my whole world, she had no idea what she had...whitney had no idea what i was giving her...but i think its too late she threw it all away..."

Overly enthused, easily confused. Do you really even have to ask, why you feel so, why you feel so used? Common obligations, common complications. She said to me in the dark, that it was just like suicide and that you really don't want to die but you've said it so many times. Like a musical trend you see it as a phase. Predictable film with a forgettable end. Why does boy meet girl leave me feeling ripped off? The police have been tipped off. Following a trail of denial they've all got my file, saying [something] You say keep your chin up. Here we are in the open air. The glow of our godless season, we're fighting for no reason we both want the same things. And its just like suicide, I really don't want to die, but we've been through this so many times. Its just like suicide, I really don't want to die, but the choice ain't mine.

KIND OF LIKE SPITTING rulues my life!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","The Way His Collar Falls

Leif and I are on the train to New York in car 1399. There's a guy with a quarter in his ear and I've seen Leif only once in the past two months. His hair is sticking up a little in the front. He's losing it just a bit. When I get home tonight I'll miss him in Hampshire. I'll miss his glasses and the way he writes in purple pen, the way his collar falls to the left. Have you seen his ankles lately? I know he's next to me. I feel his sweater here, but when I'm sleeping it's only green sheets and the hair down my legs. I think I'll write you, Leif, when I'm near Tuesday, sometime before you go and I'm back on the train.

"event","So the other night i went to the catalyst to see steve-o and the expendables. but sadly i had to be home by 12 and Steve-o was a half an hour late on stage so i didnt get to see him at all. it sucked ass! and because i left santa cruz late i got home late and i got in trouble. not cool. but thats ok. But it was nice to hang out with my older friends again. me and kristy kinda stoped talking for a little bit and that was sad but im glad i got to hang out with scotty!the other day i got a letter in the mail from zoe. shes gave me two CDs and they are pretty cool. i really like Time Spent Driving. i like the way his voice sounds and to be completely honest i love winey music like dashboard and the spill canvas.

Tomorrow i have to go to my grandpa's funeral. im not quite sure how i am going to handle that. im not quite sure if it hurts more that he actually died(dont get me wrong i loved my grandpa but now i know hes not in any more pain.) or that i have to see the rest of my family in all that pain."

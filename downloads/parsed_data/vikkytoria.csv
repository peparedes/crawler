     today was an ok day. the talent show rehersal was today, and i dont think i did so good!! owell. its tomorrow... i invited devon to go and hes going to go.. and now i dont want him to! but owell... i can live! but anywayz, nina was gonna watch the OC friday night with josh.. but uncle fred came a little earlier than expected. she was so upset.. i felt so bad! i had to give her a hug!! Tyler was asking me if i wanted to bang him.. he claims to have not been horny but uhh... he was! haha... im in despret need to kiss some one... just waiting for the next time me and devon go to the movies! last time me and devon went i kinda made a mistake... cuz the dude put his hand on top of my head (who does that??) and i moved his hand and said (in a joking way) dont touch me... he took me seriously and didnt talk to me the rest of the night!! surprisely i think we are still as before... friends but wishing we were more than friend. maybe in high skool or summer we can get together finally! THe other day he was telling me to go out with another guy and said he wouldnt talk to me until i went out with the other dude.. i was so depressed that day becuz of that!! But that i called him, and we talked forever... then it was all good again!! but umm yea... hope things go good tomorrow @ the talent show. ""do u get it yet do u get it yet??"" woot woot!

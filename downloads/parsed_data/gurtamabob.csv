"event","so whats up my one loyal reader lol. sry for not being on for a while i've been chating it up on myspace for a while. as for how i've been i went to band camp had a girlfriend that really liked me but i got stupid and broke up with her to go out with someone else and screwed me over lol. oh well learn from ur mistakes right. ne ways i'm always on the phone talkin to this gurl. and i have no clue y me and this gurl aren't going out yet but i dunno. girls r confusing. and don't u dare say guys r confusing were not lol were just misunderstood hahahahaha *random laughter being heard in the background* as for life i pretty much have nothing going for me. besides that i'm a senior and thats no fun lol all this work and stuff and i'm a lazy bastard. i've picked reading up for a hobby i guess, mainly cuz i'm bored and don't feel like playing games cuz i've beat all mine. and i'm too poor to buy ne new ones. oh yeah i got a new mp3 player cuz someone stole my old one. i like this one better even though it doesn't hold as many songs but just as many that i need. i'm lookin for a gf even though i have a gurl i like and i think the gurl likes me but i think were to shy to go out. and for all of u who keep track on my sexual life yes i'm still a virgin *sigh* its not a bad thing but its also not a good thing, but i've come to terms that i don't want to ""do it"" unless i'm with someone i really care about. but thats my philosophy now. oh and i've changed alot u may not notice it but i have. i think i've gotten more mature over the summer. plus alot of freshman tend to be in love with me *sigh* i hate the popularity and attention... well except one *blushes and gets shy* she is awesome. everything about her is awesome i really like this chick but then again it could be another haphazard attemp like chelsey and heather and brooke and all the other gurls i have had huge crushes on. but this gurl is different she is more of a me person just somethin bout her clicks like no one else has ever done before. me and the gurl went out before but it was an accident that we went out and i wanna make things right this time. theres not a thing i'd do for this gurl. and before u ask yes she does have a name her name is janie vergason weird last name huh lol. but i call her janie baby lol even though she don't like that or i call her hottie which i think she kinda likes... sometimes but oh well i've typed too much tonight my fingers r starting to cramp so cy ya later

"event","Today, I've gone to a science fair at MRSM in Kulim (of course) with the dearest classmates. It was a really good experience&nbsp; wo---oops...<br /><br />So yeah, everyone was trying to <strike>molest</strike> <i>try out</i> my phone, they were very amazed of how advanced that new phone is. *evil laugh* I didn't allow that evil indian boy to even touch my phone (I'm just like... a <strike>prince</strike> cool boy on that scene) Lawl, so let's get on to the Science fair. Before getting on the bus, Wafa and Afiqah tried out the phone and they even played TheSims 2 game I installed. It was very fun but Afiqah looks like she's not very OK. <br /><br />Finally we got into the bus... and to the fair! There were many students from other schools. Once we got there, they greeted us kindly like we're some kind of VIPs. Off we went to the experiments place. These are some photos that were taken with my new phone with their captions.

"event","<div align=""center"">Hello guys!<br />Yesterday was so fun. Me, mum, makcaq, kak elis, aneeq and haris went to The Carnivall water theme park in SP near to Cinta Sayang resort-lah.<br /><br />When I arrived there, I was really amazed by the slides and my andrenaline was rushing through my body already. I know I'm kinda exaggerating a little bit but that was what I felt : Excited. After we checked in, we met Kak Elis and her children there, having fun in the oasis. I was like, ""What the $#@$! You guys didn't wait for me?!"". But then, when I came in, the water stopped. The guys said that they need to repair something there. It was like 1 hour of waiting for the water to come. <br /><br />I was going through the slides with mama already. We travelled around the Adventure River, I mean the one with the (so-called) wild waves (river?). It was fun just to relax and let the wave just push you on your tube. I was having real fun. At the bar located at the center of the Adventure River, they were having the Quiz competition. Who wins will get a straw. First, I thought the straws can let you have free drinks there, but once the quiz competition was over, they took back their straws. They're damn crazy. T_T<br /><br />OK. So, I had it with the competitions. Let's go to the tube rides. LOL!<br />There were 2 tube rides there, green and blue. The green is fast and real thrilling but the blue is... Damn fast and @#$%ing thrilling (it's like the Boomerang in Bukit Merah). First tube ride was the green one (since mama was there to ride with me) because it's suitable for mama. It was fun! I fell off the tube when we reached at the pool below because it was damn fast.<br /><br />How about the blue tube ride, you asking? <br />To tell you the truth, no one's gonna ride with me.<br />Mama = No<br />Makcaq = No<br />Kak Elis = No<br />and of course lah<br />Aneeq and Haris = No!<br /><br />So who am I gonna ride this... I've been asking mama a lot of time to ride with me.. Since only two person can ride it... It's like the boomerang in Bukit Merah... After a long wait, mama said OK. Mama was real brave though. We climbed to the top, I was like... ""Am I doing the right thing?"" ""What about Mama? Will she be alright?"" ""Am I brave enough?!??!"" ""Why does Mama look so damn brave?! o.O""<br />Ya, mama was brave. When we're on the slide, before the guy pushed us down, I was really scared and nervous. Mama wasn't maybe because I'm the one that was sitting in front of her. So, I was waiting to be pushed down.. I just can't stop staring at the down part.. because it was so scary.. Without me being ready, he pushed the tube. OMFG. I felt like my guts were falling off, I don't know about Mama, she was actually enjoying the ride. Thankfully, the scary part was just for awhile. After that, I've gone bungee jumping there. Worst, Mama was watching me. It was shameful and I don't wanna think about it. T_T<br />That guy made me jump so high. I was like.. OMG.. I can now reach for the clouds. ^^<br />Unexpectedly, a guy took a picture of me while I was in the air. Darn, it was taken candidly.<br /><br />At the photo printing booth, we all printed the pics for today. I'm real upset because there was no picture of me UNTIL mama asked that guy to check the Bungee folder. I'M ####ING SURPRISED THERE WAS MY PICTURE INSIDE IT. DAMN, I just can't look at that picture. It was shameful, the guy kinda laughed looking at me. I'm really shocked that the bungee ride exposed my big tummy and <i>duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</i> But I decided to print it since she's still running the picture, letting everyone see it.<br />I really feel ashamed at the end of the day. The printed picture, I'll keep it secretly. Won't show u guys!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This was the ride :<br /><img src=""http://www.realmarketing.de/cms_demo/redakt/medien/picroot/104/4in1%20013.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Ok.. Bye T_T<br /></div>"

"event","Hi guys, first of all CONGRATULATIONS to Kak Mira for getting her baby boy!! Soo cute..
This is a very sad story about my Motorola E398.. That day, I was at school, brought my motorola handphone with me (to let mama know when to come and fetch me).. As planned, after school everyone was called to the field to train before the Sports Day arrive, so I placed my cellphone in my bag's secret area but I didnt notice that someone's watching. So, I placed it and went to the field. After about 2 hours, I came back and was shocked that my E398 wasnt in the secret area, but my SIM card was. I was really shocked and stumped, what I couldn't forget was the brand new 512 mb memory card I bought and unfortunately the card was in my handphone. What a damn loss. I started telling my friends and they said they wanna help me (but they didn't).. but something's letting me go of it, something that tells me that the motorola phone ain't the best phone I had. The best phone I had was the Sony Ericsson's phone.

So, last night mama bought me a new phone (thanks mama). A 2nd hand phone called Nokia 6100, and it's really cool. I think Imma enjoy using this phone more than I enjoyed using the last stolen motorola phone. 

One more thing, got all the nice ringtones that I love (especially in Fara's old handphone) like Fantasie, Celestine, Tap Dance and Songette. (all those useless Nokia songs lol) Miss you Faraaaaahhh

That's all for now, I don't really feel sad about losing the E398. Maybe because the slow UI graphic or whatever, just turned me off.
Goodbye my friend Motorola. I'm never gonna buy Motorola brand ever again."

I don't understand what's up with her either. She's acting weird and ignoring me without any reason. I'm kinda sad because we were best friends in Sec 1 and 2. Maybe it's because we sit far away from each other? I don't know, but I'm sad. <br /><br />Maybe you'll think that this is just a simple thing <b>wait till you know what she did.</b><br /><br />She treats other people well, but she ignores me most of the time. I've tried my best to get closer but each and everytime I try, she'll run away. By her actions, I know that she's ignoring me to the fullest. I feel kinda left out. Maybe it's because those damn idiot boys that usually tease '<b>us</b>' and called us something like lovers. I feel bad, was it because of the idiots? The truth is, I DON'T LOVE HER. She's my best friend, we used to share eachother's secrets and talk when teachers aren't at class. I miss those moments you know, I wish I can turn back time. I feel really empty right now...<br /><br /><br /><b>wafa is something afterall..</b> something that I don't know by now.</font></div>"

Ntahla apa dia buat.. Pastu tengok ghost hunters kejap then dia masuk bilik suruh try computer.. So aku pun try ah komputer.. alangkah tak <b>sangkanya</b> dia telah melimitkan account aku.. Account aku limited dan tak boleh install anything.. tak logik laaaaaa .. pastu aku pun apa lagi, try nak masuk account dia <b>adoi</b> password protected pulak dah.. hampeh tul.. aku pun terus activate my computer skill dan make me <font size=""5"">powerful</font> again!! muawahahah.. aku buat account baru melalui <i>(<b>erm xleh gitau ah</b>) </i>dan set account tu sebagai computer administrator account.. Aku delete account limited tu and put the same name and the same pic as the old account just to trick him.. Tau da dia tu mesti susah to be cheated but if you don't try <b>u'll never know</b>! Mama kata kita kena mengalah dengan dia dan mengaku saja kita yang bersalah (walaupun kita xbersalah) pasal <i>we'll lose to him</i> no <b>matter what</b>.. mesti dia cakap berbelit2 and salahkan kita gak...</div>"

I went to HappyVille to decorate my own Christmas Tree *weehee* it was really fun <i>(until Phil entered the frame)..  </i>Well, fara has been bragging about my koman posts without images, but this time bebeh, <b>worry no more</b> because I'm showing you the best of HappyVille!<i><br /><br /><br /></i>HappyVille was pretty wonderful and really peaceful.. You can also get to decorate your own Christmas tree with your own equipments (without getting <b><i>owned</i></b>). The items are protected so people can't take any of your items.. Isn't that wonderful? Hahahahah.. Oh, for your information, I bought a moustache because most of the people in Bootes think I'm a girl. <b>Screw u all!</b><br /><br />Let's look at the <b>wonderful </b>screenshots!<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img371.imageshack.us/img371/537/bc1eq9.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img367.imageshack.us/img367/7627/bc2nm1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><font size=""5""><b><font size=""3"">Phil was just trying to joke around with the letters of HappyVille..

"event","<div align=""center""><font size=""3"">I'll make this post as gay-ish as i can (jgn la pikiaq bukan2, gay-ish maksudnya tak control laa), So please read teh post and please make a sandwich dulu and kencing dulu like fara said..<br /><b>off-post</b> : fufu, post u beri beri cute and sedap.. lapar ahhh..<br /><b>So, lets start..</b><br /><br />I'm just back from KL tapi xla penat sangat cam ok je... so ni nak crita journey to KL~ tahap besa ja kalu boring pls tekan ALT+F4 kalau tak, tune in lahs....<br /><br />For your information : <b>Misha</b> adalah budak kecik yang berumur 7 darjah 1..<br /><br />So I decided to folo mama to KL.. Makcharr bawak keta.. mula2 memang tamau pasai tak larat (haa jgn salahkan computer aaa).. so, xpala no big deal la ikut pasal kak elis pun nak jumpa gak kat sana so takla boring sangat kan?<br />Pada hari 1st tu sampai.. memang boring gilo tak tau apa nak buat.. tengok movie anaconda kat hotel pastu tidoq zzz<br />2nd day pulak.. mama call tengah2 pagi suruh pi 'bermesra' ngan anak kawan dia.. hampeh la tak kenai lagi pun nak bermesra.. mama paksa paksa haiyaa... So, xpala.. esoknya makcharr ajak keluaq makan pastu I pun ajak la anak kawan mama tu.. (actually he's not so bad as a new friend) Die pendiam sesangat la sampai dekat chicken rice shop macam senyap ja.. Suasana sgtla awkward.. 20 more mins, Maktam, Paktam, Kak yanti and Misha arrived at the awkward location.. Haaa what a life saver!! Lepas habis makan, aku ngan Lukman (anak kawan mama) pigi la tempat main game [arcade].. Mula2 main racing ja pasal boring.. pastu beli lagi token main lagi racing.. Budak tu senyap betoi sakit hati aku dibuatnya.. T_T!!! Pastu kitorang pun pegi la jalan2 kat shopping complex yang sangatlah boring.. Pastu decided to go back to the arcade but this time.. memang best.. Main air hockey (yang atas table tu) lawak giloooo.. Die gelak sampai batuk2 aku pun gelak sampai batuk2.. hadui main 6 kali plak tu. enjoy betul.. pastu, dia balik hotel.. Lepas tu.. erm.. I decided to go to rumah Mak tam to jumpa Asyran and go shopping there pasal kat sana banyak sikit tempat shopping best best.. So sampai rumah maktam terus *boom* ngantuk sangat.. <br /><br />Esoknya.. Maktam and Paktam brought me and Misha to Planetarium.. Tak penah pi lagi haha.. Planetarium tu memang best and full of info pasal astronauts and etc.. So, I pun pigi la masuk graviti room tu.. gilakopo.. graviti tu tarik sampai naik sakit seluruh badan.. dah la pening.. kesian kat orang putih yang nak masuk graviti room tu pasal banyak orang kampung yang masuk and bising2.. so orang putih tu pun keluaq gravity room tu.. harap2 phil tak macam tu.. So, lepas tu rasa penat sgt pasal naik tangga tinggi.. hmm takpa la pastu kami pigi Times Square pasal Misha pun dok gaduh2 nak naik rollercoaster (tak waras ni..).. So, xpala mula2 macam tamau masuk theme park tu tapi dah maktam nak masuk sekali so masuk pila.. Mula2 takut jugak Misha tu buat2 berani.. Mula2 naik la Oort's Express tu.. Sakit betui aku dihimpit Misha.. dia himpit I cam nak pecah tulang.. dah la besaq.. So, lepas tu lenguh2 la badan kena himpit.. Lepas tu naik la Dizzy Izzy, Misha takut gilo pasal rasa geli perut. No hope for Rollercoaster lah, sikit2 pun dah takut.. Actually, memang terkezut jugak Misha ni berani sangat nak naik Dizzy Izzy tu.. Pastu lepas habis tu naik la dekat tempat budak2.. Aku pun nak pegi naik Rollercoaster dulu.. Tak payah Queue pun dah boleh naik.. Haiih.. perasaan takut tu mmg la ada tp biasa je.. WOOOT rollercoaster dah start ah.. memang best gilo sampai lepas tu pun aku naik skali lagi ngan seorang stranger dari singapore yang bermain Maple.. (lost contact) So, lepas naik tu, tak pun rasa pening rasa cam nak naik lagi... Penat la.. So, pendekkan cerita, lepas tu kami pun balik la kerumah.. Dapat jugak jumpa si Asyran yang gila tu. Banyak gile kawan dia kat situ sampai kat mana2 pun kawan2 dia teguq sini sana..<br />lepas tu die pun hanta aku balik rumah dan tidoq.. <br /><br />Hari ni pun tiba.. aku nak balik daa.. Maktam masak Tom Yam yg sangatla sedap and Nachos with melting cheese.. Sedap gila. Pastu check out hotel and say bubbye and thanks to Maktam and Paktam..<br /><br />Dalam perjalanan balik Haris main ngan aku sampai dia cium and hug me &gt;.&lt;"" cute giloo rasa cam nak cubit ja tangan dia.. Pastu singgah bilik Kak Ein yang sangatla best and sejuk.. Makan KFC (<i>sedih pasal kena duduk bawah meja masa makan</i>).. So, lepas tu pegi round2 ngan keta Kak Ein <b>Savvy</b> merah tu.. Best la jugak. So, pastu kami pun balik terus and mama terus tidoq.. <br /><br />Hurm.. *yawn*<br /></font></div>"

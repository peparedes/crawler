he always plays basketball during lunch so after i eat me & my friend marina go to the gym, well i dunno why but we had to be in the up-stairs gym cause the main gym was closed, so after lunch was over he grabbed his binder and went down stairs so we were going out the door too when i saw his sweater on the floor i grabed it and marina was all ""ewww but it down"" i'm all ""noway! this is patrick's and i'm gonna give it to him"" and so i was gonna give it to him when it feel from my hands and landed on the stair case, well there was like 100 people behind us so i couldn't go back i felt bad during 4th, 5th, and 6th period till finally it was 3:15 and skol was o-u-t so i was at my friends locker (which his locker s rite next 2 hers; i wonder y i was there *thinx* anyclays,) my friend is all ""when did u get ur sweater back?"" (i told her about wat happened) he said, ""i got it before i went to 4th period, but people were stepping on it, 'cause someone threw it on the starie case"" i started laughing he thought my friend did it he pointed at her and said ""YOU!"" and i was still laughing and then he said ""YOU IT WAS YOU IMAN!!!!"" (iman is my real name pro-nounced E-man) and he pushed my backpack, then left, i felt real bad but it was so funny! and so i walk home and my friend rides the bus, so i was walking out w/ her 2 her bus and i saw patrick walking out with his bike, i yelled ""sorri patrick!"" he said something but i couldn't hear wat it wuz, so yeah that was long a detailed! i'm gonna go now! later!

"event","Since Patrick knows i like him, he's been avoiding me a little to much. Its very annoying to me, honestly. I looked 4 him at lunch but he wasn't anywhere 2 b found, not even the gym. *crys* Finally i saw him in the health office, he was hurt, i used one of my ELA bathroom passes and kept walking back & forth trying to see his beautiful eyes. I did. After school the Yearbook teacher asked me to stay after to talk 2 her about the yearbook and he was behind me. OMC! i was freaken out after i saw him. I smiled and he ignored. I asked Michelle to tell Patrick that i didn't like him, i dunno if she told him or not though. 

Anyclays, i just got done watching TRL that my mom taped for me. Clay is soooooooooooooo funny. Lucky Kelly. The Way video clip is cute. while i was watching it i saw me and patrick... i dunno y, but he's always on my mind, hey! thats a grate song eh?"

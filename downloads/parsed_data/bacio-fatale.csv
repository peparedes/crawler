"event","<div style=""text-align: center;"">Your ruling planet is Venus, the mythic goddess of love and beauty. Because of this, lots of people think Libra should be the easiest sign to understand. All you need is love, right? Wrong. Libra is an air sign. And air is concerned 
with ideals and principles above all else. Ah, love. Of course you think a lot about love. But the operative word here is think. 

Your idea of love isn't really an intimate, steamy or a chaotic explosion of uncontrolled passions. More likely it will involve a quiet meeting in a pleasant environment, where you can expound on one of your many theories on the perfect relationship, your concepts about how people ought to behave toward each other, and your clear, faultless vision of a world where everything is balanced, ordered, symmetrical and harmonious. 

All that discussion about love can drive more emotive types mad. Although you can be as sexually inspired as any other sign, in the end the sharing of ideas is as important to you as the sharing of bodies. If there's no communication, you can get bored pretty quickly. Your sign has less to do with ordinary sweaty human coupling than any other, and for you love must always be stylish, never coarse. 

Libra is the great perfectionist of the zodiac. You use the words ""fair"" and ""equal"" a lot. You believe passionately in fairness, which can cause you unhappiness, because life and people aren't always fair. You also believe passionately in equality, and here, too, you may encounter unhappiness, because finding a relationship where each partner gives and takes exactly the same amount and loves the other equally is like finding a unicorn. 

No doubt you believe in unicorns too, and you're prepared to go on searching for that perfect companion, that perfect career, that perfect environment where no human mess intrudes. You're forever seeking the Good, the True and the Beautiful. And in your eternal efforts to change the world and make it a place where the Good, the True and the Beautiful can make their abode, you're likely to genuinely succeed in making life just that bit better and more beautiful. 

Librans have the gift of creating style, grace and harmony wherever they go. You pursue your goals with diplomacy, tact and statesmanship, since you know much more gets accomplished when you've managed to convince people that your idea is their idea by a liberal use of the royal Libran ""We"". Of course, you usually do exactly what you want. But you have the knack of getting everyone around you to co-operate. 

You have a positive hatred of emotional storms, so you probably have trouble expressing your own emotions honestly. Anger, hatred, jealousy, neediness, intense desire - frightening stuff, all of it, and expressing it can get you into trouble (meaning that other people might get hurt or angry with you). 

Librans, those great lovers of Truth, are often emotionally dishonest with themselves and with others, although it's never intentional and never out of a desire to deceive. But when your anger blows (and it always does, when you've saved it up for too long), it can really blow. You can be the original ""meek as a lamb or mad as a hornet"" personality. Yet neither of these is really a true reflection of your essentially harmonious nature. 

No matter how many times you get out of balance, the path between the extremes will always beckon with its gentle light, and the search for perfect equilibrium will always ensure that your life never stagnates. And maybe you recognise a secret that lots of other people don't see: that it's genuinely possible for human beings to be more than they are: more Good, more True and more Beautiful.

"event","<div style=""text-align: center;"">So I've been on the search for apartments in Vegas. Just need moms accounting help to help me figure out everything.
I wish I had atleast one dependable person that would want to move with me, cause it would be easier on both of us if two of us went into it together because rent would be cheaper.

<ul>
<li>  So if anyone knows of anyone who is trying to move out of their house and doesnt care where they go, or someone who wants to move to Vegas and is DEPENDABLE AND HAS MONEY AND WILL GET A JOB to keep paying rent. Please let me know because that would make things a little bit easier.</li>
<li>It would be sometime before late August/ early September because thats when the next semester starts, and I obviously need to be there for that</li></ul>

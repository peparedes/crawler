A lipid lid black at the hairline, drowsy as a sullen set of poppy leaves, trickling, lets a fluttering, extra fleeting thought run (You'd better go catch it!).  The coarseness of his hair is telling, it sands down the rough air around him with every disjointed thrashing, every false set of harsh words dribbled out his lips (He often unconsciously outbursts into fire).  He takes me against his legs, he wants me on my back.  All the way through the gritty gray light I watch his skin pour over the muscles built by terrific work, for which I touch, for which my fingers work.  He sang out in his sleep one of those nights, maniacally pounding clenched fists, fighting the springs in my mattress.  I clawed at his bare chest, though tenderly spoke to his furrowed brow, his down turned lips.  A drawing memory slithered twice around my ear, ""I love your nails,"" in a smoke burned throat up came these words as hushed as they were written.  So my heart reluctantly swelled. I turned from him and lovingly nursed the wound he had burned into the back of my neck, soft, as to apply anti-aging though time never did stop.  Sleepless, heavy lidded moments drudged on.  Eyes rolling, most especially in a furious way, I think of my next step."

"event","<p>Hands 10 O'clock, 2 O'clock (9 to 5)<br />but actually 3pm to 8pm.<br />I get lazy and use a finger to steer.&nbsp; The rig coasts because it's heavy and cigarette cravings nibble tenderly at my voice box, projecting a subtle moan.&nbsp; My head starts to reel, back and forth my eyes bob like dead fish in a wave pool.&nbsp; The pavement is vast, black as a volcanic beach; dashed with life-like turtles it sprawls as a dropped piece of fabric.&nbsp; Fences of trees frame the billowing landscape and I&nbsp;am lonely.&nbsp; Yearning wraps itself against the walls of my throat and I&nbsp;am choking.&nbsp; Breathless, a poorly circulated mind flashes faces before my eyes.&nbsp; There I&nbsp;cringe, begin to moan, fighting the strength of memory--squinting--boiling up from my soul, a howl breaks: a wailing, rocking, succubus singing cry.&nbsp; A lonely cat that moans on the fences overlooking empty backyards of suburbia, I am she.&nbsp; Veiled in black, in the cab of my car, I&nbsp;allow the welling of my emotions with an aching grip to hold my heart out for the moon to judge--the soul of the lonesome, the eye who treats the troubled.&nbsp; I cannot stand the glare (too bright, too shining); I'm not hungry enough for its fullness.&nbsp; I&nbsp;ashamedly retract, become compact to keep out of sight, to where I&nbsp;send a distant and abstract message to a sleeping lover.&nbsp; He never gets it.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I'm so fucking afraid, petrified, scared stiff of you, me, everything.
I'm afraid of being with you for forever,
I'm afraid of losing you,
I'm afraid you'll find someone else, 
that I'm holding you back because I still love you.
I'm afraid of moving away,
of being forced to do new things.
I'm afraid of being lonely, no matter who I'm with.
I'm afraid of everyone and anyone, I don't want to be with them.  I just want you.
I'm afraid I'll stay with you, 
and you aren't my soulmate, my heart.
I'm afraid I'll never find my soulmate, my heart.
I'm afraid of not moving away,
of not becoming anything.
I'm afraid of falling in love with someone else.
I'm afraid of crying all my tears.
I'm so fucking afraid that my responsibilities will catch up to me,
that my money will run out.
I'm afraid of burning out,
going insane,
not being pretty enough,
not being feminine enough.
I'm afraid of being someone I'm not, I do it every day.
I'm afraid I'm not strong enough to stop myself, just stop myself from myself.
I'm afraid someone will judge me, and be right.
I'm afraid I hate my dad too much.
I'm afraid people might find out who I really am.
I'm afraid I've made too many mistakes, that I can never fix.
I cower in fear before life, past, present, future.
I'm so scared."

the distance between us seems to grow
But you're holding on strong

So i predicted Carmen would win, and she whooped that ugly chics ass.  Now Carmen Electra is my girlfriend <3

After that I hit the gym and practiced with Henry Rollins and he taught me a new fighting style: Karate.

I used it to take out some chinks at the Triads club

Look at your group of friends and think about how you've felt about each individual in the group.  I doubt it has been the same for more than a year.

Why do we single out a member of a group of friends?  Is it to keep things interesting? Even if you doubt that, and you believe that your friend is being an asshole or doing something stupid, is it possible that maybe you are being the asshole and the one is doing stupid things.  Maybe your friend's not changing into someone worse, maybe you are.

"event","Lately I've been discovering a lot about women.  Over the past week or two, I've realized quite a number of things.

1.  Females will take the ""load"" off other girls shoulders (when dealing with drama) by over              exagerating the things going on in their life.  They will also say or do anything to make their girlfriends feel better.  This could include hating people, telling lies, or ignoring some people.  This makes the girl having trouble feel like she is justified in her decision to be mad at a certain person.  Whats funny is it all goes away after a week or so.

2. Girls can like any guy and tell all their friends, and the moment one thing goes wrong for her chances, the like for the person is completely erased.

3. Girls have absolutely no sense of humor when it comes to their bodies.  Ask for a picture from a guy when he was his ugliest, and he'll probably give it to you.  Ask the same to a girl, you won't get a thing.  The picture has probably already been burned and buried.

Of course when you all read this (women especially) you're going to say that I'm full of shit and I have absolutely no understanding of women what-so-ever.  Regardless, this text will stay in this journal, even if it makes me look like a total jackass.

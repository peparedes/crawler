"event","so i've had all this time to think (being grounded and all)
and yea..so all this random stuff about me i keep thinking about.

- livejournal isnt great(at all-so why do i continue it?).
- I <b>hate</b> liars.(so much)
- I <i>REALLY</i> like hugs.
- and I <b>REALLY</b> like kisses on the cheek.
- Trust is a big deal to me.
- I don't like being alone.
- Meaning when I move out I Will have a room-mate.
- Sometimes I fall a lil harder than I should.
- When it seems I'm ok, I'm usually not-just don't want you to see me hurt.
- If I don't have anything to take a picture of, I tend to point it towards me.
- I am extremely self-concious about myself(and my body).
- I am TOO skinny(its gross).
- My self-esteem isn't always too high.
- I repeat myself.
- Fish is gross to me.
- Love is over-rated(or maybe I am just jealous of those who have it).
- Its ridiculous how shy I am in front of some people and not others.
- I have regrets.
- I need more friends.
- Certain things hurt me, and I deny it when you ask me.
- I feel completely blank right now.
- I hate knowing I can't do anything about something so small.
- The habit of biting my nails, bothers me.
- I don't wear skirts because I look at my legs and say, ""ew"".(even if the skirt is to my knees)
- I get jealous, sometimes I just can't help it.
- I would rather you be up front with me than hide something cause you think it will hurt me.
- I don't make my bed, ever.
- Watching a romantic comedy is needed sometimes.
- Talking on the phone to certain people just put me in better moods, even if my mood sucks.
- Certain people just make me smile.
- I might be addicted to caffeine.
- I do random dance movements with my mom(occasionaly).
- I don't think I've ever been in love, but i was close(i think). 
 
it keeps going but i won't bore you considering most of you are skipping through this anyway.

and because you had to endure this bull shizz of mine i end it with pictures.
Today was one of those roll out of bed and be lazy days(mainly bc i couldnt do anyting)
so i was dirty boy today.hahah.
Lame Boredom Dumb <lj-cut text=""pictures"">
I was glued to the computer today since there wasnt anything else to do.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v185/nolovefound/DSCN0608.jpg"">
On a day of being grounded and the Limons and munchos are out..all i need is this..
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v185/nolovefound/DSCN0612.jpg"">
I'm such a loser when im bored, well even when im not bored.

i thought this face would get me ungrounded, nope.

SO i made dinner. YUM YUM NOODLES. spaghetti is soooo good.GEEZE
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v185/nolovefound/DSCN0622.jpg"">
then just stared at my mom like this for awhile hoping she would get annoyed and tell me to leave.

i have thought about this. looooong and hard. REALLY
i told you i wouldnt make a bunch of dumb posts and what not.(so i wont)
but this might be an exception.
and considering its my lj and barely anyone reads it anyway. o well.

i wont say i hate you. cause i dont.
i will say it hurt. but i wont say im not going to be ok. (cause i will..eventually)
i've learned alot from this.so i will thank you for that.
for instance..
-i trust people TOO easily.
-if i put 2 and 2 together i should talk to you about 4 (no one will probly get this,but thats ok. I do and thats what matters)
-if something happens once dont be to sure it wont happen again.
-shitty situations..well damnit, they will most likely end up shitty.
-i guess what happened(you know) i wouldnt consider a mistake or regret and im not going to apologize for it happening, just something i got over with. and can now go for ROUND 2! whether or not its you!..haha..just kidding..
______

deep down i think you are a great person. I'm sure you didnt mean for it to end up like this. Just happened, what can you do about it, right? If its what is going to make you happy, do it, make yourself happy before trying to make others happy. I still want to hang out, because we are still friends(meaning we can still be cool and just have fun) and we being as awesome as we are, we should do that sometime. I just hope the decision you made, was the right one, one that came from the heart and is how you feel. If so, I'm fine.
Thats all.

______

p.s.- Jessica Rogers, I really love you girl. I'm glad your always there for me (esp. when people who are suppose to be there for me are too busy with boys). We need to hang out morrrrrrre because I miss you and im SICK of it! hah..much <3 to you jessica your so awesome and great. I really mean it.
______

P.S.S.-thanks to you for talking to me when I couldn't talk to her because of her PHONE. Made me feel a lil better.

Don't worry i won't dwell on it, i'm sure you dont want me to, and i'm sure your not either."

"event","<b>this song is crazy and it makes me laugh.</b>

It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

Oh, oooh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me
Ohh, oh, oh was the one little thing that you can
<b>dude this song makes me laugh.its crazy.</b>

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Say you will baby, you want me too

All night long ...

All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew."

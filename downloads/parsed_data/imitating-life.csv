Check this out:

Person A has a problem with Person B. So what should Person A do?

A) Complain about stupid Person B to Person C. Person C will back them up. Person B is <u>always</u> in the wrong!
B) Who's driving the bus?
C) Tell Person B about the problem, and together they sort the problem out. Like in Peer Mediation, which everyone makes fun of in high school. Who needs it in high school? In high school, we know how to communicate.
D) Light Person B's pants on fire.
E) *whisper whisper whisper*

i'm going to northville this weekend. for skruff. i'll see scott. and mellowship, they're fun. i don't think dylan is around for some reason, but i'll check.

the weekend after is homecoming. i don't think i'll go. perhaps i will. who knows? tori is going with kyle. kyle's boyfriend doesn't go to dances. kyle is a boy's name.

i start giving anna drum lessons this week. her name is really amanda, but alex and i are certain that she introduced herself as anna, so we're going with that.

i'm going to make a cutter shirt. something like ""cutting is <u>so</u> cool"" or ""look at me! i'm a cutter!"". i need to converse with alex on it, though. i feel nostalgic for the old days of making fun of people. i better curb that soon.

i'm going to make a bright eyes shirt now.

i keep getting shivery right before lunch, even when i'm warm. i just shake for no good reason. except the cold today.

i don't understand people at all. and they say you have the most control when you realize what little control you have. you can only control yourself.

"event","On Sunday, Shane, my brother and I all went to the Phantom Planet show. The first band was Steriogram, from New Zealand. They were the most humorous band I've ever seen (in a bad way.) They were like Sum 41's music, with Good Charlotte's appearance, and a monkey rapping. The lead singer was a scarecrow, 6'3"", and thinner than Noah. He moved like a monkey and sang the worst lyrics. And then every chorus would be all four of the other band members singing a melody (not harmony) while the rap guy rapped over it. They were the essence of Hot Topic, in a band. They had a song about how the lead singer's mother was fat. And their first single in the U. S. is called ""Walkie Talkie Man"". A couple frat boys were really rocking out to it and when I saw I laughed and one of them flipped me off. People are funny.

The second band was The Thrills, from Dublin, Ireland. They were superb. They played a kind of classy garage 70's rock with country influence (in a good way.) When they did one of their songs, ""Not for All the Love in the World"", they dimmed the stage lights and put on this yellow glowing disco type ball over the crowd. And towards the end they turned the stage lights completely off for ten seconds or so and left the disco ball on. It was very cool. Oh, also the guitarist and bassist switched instruments for the second half of the set. That was groovy.

And Phantom Planet was awesome too. There was a very inebriated woman in her late twenties who was dancing like those type do, in a very unfitting style for the setting, moving her pelvis a significant amount more than necessary and grabbing the security guy (who was standing on a chair to watch the crowd)'s hand and dancing with him. It was a very Mtv friendly setting, which kinda weakened it, but Phantom Planet did an awesome job. During the encore, the lead singer climbed from the second level (which was closed) onto people's hands and proceeded to walk to the bar. A very cool show.

And also, I was rejected from camp and will therefore have to get a real job. Ouch."

They were really good, then not so good, then good again. And Death Cab ruled as always. During Ben Kweller's set, Violet and I went and got to talk to Death Cab's guitarist, which was pretty cool, he signed my cd booklet. Nice guy. Emo kids are nice folks.

I'm stuck at my dad's until six, when I have a drum lesson. Then I get to go home.

"event","so everyone may know the events of last night:

At 6:30ish, Violet, Noah, Shane and I arrive at Oxford High School for the Talent Show which begins at 7. Noah has his guitar, and I have drumsticks. We are not one of the acts listed on the program.

The program begins. A stupid video made by Oxford's video media class is aired. A few people laugh. (okay, maybe more than a few). It's a mediocre attempt, at best. After the video ends, the acts begin. We have Boone doing a guitar solo and running around being metal, some ridiculously strippers, er, i mean dancers and something else.

I notice the evil ogre woman (ms. Otte) walk by. Yes, not only is she angry and gave me evil looks when I actually tried out for the talent show (with cry mutiny, not me and noah), but she stares at me in the halls, as if I'm a troublemaker. Well, maybe I am. She is temporarily not in front of the hall leading to the stage's back door. We make a run for it.

We slip in the door. No one is around, although we passed a few people in the hall. No on thought anything of us, nor cared.

The drama club is currently working on ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"" and their set includes a giant Snoopy doghouse. Noah and I slip inside, where he placed his guitar earlier.

The act right now is two drummers who are doing a fine job of drumming, for much too long a period of time. Silly drummers.

Noah and I are crouched in the dark, watching people walk by, set things down, pick things up, but continue unseen.

The drummers finish and No Object begins to play. The area surrounding the doghouse appears to be clear. We step out nonchalantly and stand off to the side, in view of a few people on the other side of the stage, but no one thinks anything of us.

Just then, the ogre walks in the door. Takes a glance at us, mumbles an excuse me, and walks by. We breathe again. A few minutes later, she walks back, and stands inches away talking to some kid. Then exits.

The song reaches it's end, only the singer/rhythm guitarist and bassist are playing now. We storm the stage

Noah runs out and rips the cable from the lead guitarist's input jack (that sounds hot, doesn't it?) I run over to the drummer and give him a push. He gets up and walks away, looking at me with disgust. I start to play ""Wait."" Noah comes in. We play through the chorus and two lines of verse. The ogre looks at us. Looks at the program. Looks at us again. Looks at the program...

Then Mr. Wilson, the old and still unhip (though he may not believe so) walks out (doesn't shut the curtain) and turns Noah's amp off. Noah and I flee the scene via jumping off the stage. We run out the door to the sounds of laughter and applause. We hop into Shane's car and pull away. A video media kid makes a half-hearted attempt to stop us, but he's smiling and is glad to see us escape. We win.

Well kids, that's today's lesson in anarchy 101. Hope you enjoyed it. Next weeks lesson: How disguises can offset chances of getting suspended next time..."

And then Jadon and I are going to install it. Jadon. Who keeps forcing us to cancel practice. And then goes to auto shows when we are supposed to pick up couches. Falvey should be our bassist. Last night, he came over and we talked communism with my father for a while, then we watched fight club and fell asleep.

I also obtained more cd's.
The Flaming Lips, ""Egg""
The Walkmen, ""Everyone who pretended to like me is gone"" ""bows and arrows""

Steve Burns (the guy from blue's clues)""Songs for Dust Mites"" (surprisingly good)

east alley records in rochester is closing, so noah, shane, violet and i drove over there the other night and i bought smashing pumpkins ""still becoming"", oasis ""what's the story (morning glory)?"", alien ant farm ""truant"", lost prophets ""the fake sound of progress"", and tabula rasa's self-titled ep. i also obtained two giant mars volta posters, a rufus wainright poster and a modest mouse 45/33 (it's 45 rpm on one side and 33 on the other.) pretty nifty.

3 copies of J. D. Salinger's <u>Nine Stories</u>
Radiohead, ""Amnesiac""
John Coltrane, ""My Favorite Things""
Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane, ""Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane""
The Jimi Hendrix Experience, ""Are You Experienced""
Death Cab for Cutie, ""You Can Play These Songs With Chords""
Death Cab for Cutie, ""Something About Airplanes""
A plethora of vinyl records including The Police, Simon & Garfunkel and Billy Idol
Numerous pairs of socks
A beautiful mixed tape
A shirt that says ""SNARLED""
A disco light
A hoodie
A lamp
A cool shirt
The movie, Suburbia, directed by Richard Linklater of Waking Life and Dazed and Confused
Many good books by such greats as Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Ayn Rand and more

and the most important of all, the most brilliant record of our time, or any time...

The Smashing Pumpkins, ""Adore""

Which I already had, but it was a burned copy and I wanted the real thing. And now I have it. 

Thank you very much to the usual suspects (my parents, sister, brother, senile grandmother, etc.) and also to my very dear significant other, Violet, and to my extremely most swellest friend in the entire universe who buys me way to much stuff, all of which I enjoy way too much, Lisa Anna.

I was fortunate enough to view the movie Pi last night. A phenomenal film, I highly recommend it.

I still have a few more presents to dispense, to the likes of Mike Stephens and others I do not recall at the moment.

I wish Abby a happy post birthday and hope she enjoyed my gift.

I very well may be going to camp on the 28th, and will see Anne and Abby, a joyous occasion indeed, but it is not certain.

I send my love to all who already know I do. It is now your task to receive it.

On a quick side note: The other night I had a dream. I was talking to my younger sister and then she casually mentioned she got laid the other night, and I flipped out. So I am officially in freaked out older brother mode, and have been yelling at her for her shorts being too short and for giving looks to the postman for a day or two now. All testosterone injected males, stay back. I have a tazer."

cherished memories seen on negative film
with inverted colors in 1 1/2 by 1 squares

all the times i had with you could simply be reduced
to a four photo line for $2.50 in a photobooth
from when we went to the skating to no alternative's show
perfect for the song i wrote, now just circumstantial proof

all the times spent kissing, i wish that we had talked
fewer movies in your darkened room, more brisk autumn walks
nothing can compare to the blue-light christmas eve
you game me your heart in a wound line of magnetic tape

oh so lovingly, i wound the tape around your throat
over carefully covered bruises, i set you up to choke
and bloody tears from my eyes flowed freely down my face
and i tighted the ribbon you gave to me; it stretched until it broke

nothing good can come of me, i murder those i love
i stab, strangle, i cut them down, using fingerprint masking gloves
so flee while you can, prey, you're much to lovely to survive

"event","lisa and i talked, and we're going to take our relationship a little less seriously so i can decide if i wish to pursue it romantically or not. kinda rough stuff. i feel rather badly, but it seemed like something that should be done. i'm so emotionally screwed up. i had a dream last night, and my mother and little brother (alex) were ragging on me about something after i got off this long hike with someone, i don't remember who. but then i climbed this big tower, and was planning on jumping off and killing myself. then i realized i wouldn't die if i did it. so i did it. and broke something in myself.

i just finished my recording of 'with apologies'. it's pretty messed up and technorific. it starts with a distorted drum machine, then i have two guitars playing harmonics, and there's vocal harmonies and distorted vocals. i'm uploading it to mp3.com in a minute.

last night, i did a new recording of maybe. i added organ and bongos. it's kinda cool. i'm going to upload that too.

i bought a lot of cool stuff for everyone for christmas. including you, sis. so be happy. i spent $110 at salvation army. and only had $70. so i borrowed some from mrs. wietor, and my mother paid her back. and i'm paying my mother back. i hope everyone enjoys their presents.

with apologies
by willy skillets

but i confess
i wore you like a blood-stained dress
and hanged you on a wire frame
which doubtless couldn't take the strain
stretching down, bent out of shape
a silk sleeve ripped in rape

but i detest
my grievous indifference
i dropped you like my cigarettes
as a sin, a vice, a coming death
a bitter silence as farewell
i toasted to your hell"

"event","lisa anna is more than skinny enough. and does not need to lose weight. and if she gained weight, would still be beautiful, unless perhaps she got so huge she pulled earth off it's rotation and we were all destroyed. until then, she's beautiful. and if she's smiling, then everything is okay. and she is talented beyond belief, and can do everything ever. and she is graceful. and she never falls, because she is a dancer. and a ballerina. and she saves me. and everyone can know it."

"event","So lisa anna thinks i should update my journal. So i am. And I'm having a good time doing it. And she's putting a  thing on my neck. (not a hickey) (a necklace of some sort). And we're having spaghetti tonight. Abby, don't worry, the curse will not take effect. I need to find my train of thought. And to go to more shows, because i do not go to enough.

ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

awaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

i like lisa anna.
she gets to stay.
lisa anna, party of one. your table is ready.

oh, last night at the musical, i added my fun bonus line even though i was told i was not allowed to beforehand. At some point, amy verbeke asks the gamblers if any will give testimony as to why they are bad people and such, and i yell ""no one's touching my testimonies!"" and it's awesome and people laugh and are joyous and smiles.

and lisa anna and my sister bought my cool balloons even though lisa anna gave me a flower the night before and i was very excited. and she is my girlfriend type figure and goes to all my plays almost and it is nice. and i smile for no good reason. except that she's sitting next to me.

that's all."

"event","I'm in northville for the evening, to have dinner with my aunt betsy. Scott wasn't home, so I went to the library to play on the internet. Voila, a journal entry.
	Tomorrow, I have early morning (9ish) breakfast with Jadon, Justin, PJ, Lisa and hopefully Tony, if I talk to him. And then Teggerdine plays for a while, and is consistently awesome. And then Jadon, Justin, Lisa and I go to see Mock Orange and Switchblade Romance at Idle Kids, which I am thoroughly stoked for, as Mock Orange has not been out here in I dunno how long, but definitely not since I've been into them. So that will be an awesome show. Sunday, I go to church, chill with Violet until my dress rehearsal at one, and then home again. Then the week starts over again, only more hectic this time, because the play occurs on wed, thurs, fri and sat. And we are not ready. Oh well, doesn't bother me, as I am merely Rusty Charlie. Rock on. Have a good one, all.

yes indeed
alone again
and here comes emptiness
crashing in
it's either love or hate
i can't find in-between
'cause i have been with witches and i have
been with the queen

it wouldn't have worked out
anyway
so for now it's just another lonely day
further alone, we just may
but for now its just another lonely day"

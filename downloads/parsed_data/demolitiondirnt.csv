"event","Ok so the title makes NO SENSE WHAT SO EVER. But oh well. Anyway, I'm bored, you're hot let's get it on. No just kidding. I'm seriously DEAD BORED. SO SHOOT ME, BABEH. She walks on red carpet all the time in my eyes. Other will scoff at her clothes coming off they will talk let them talk cause you've given them just what they want. Sing it to me, sweets.

You know what? I'm totally overly desperate. But seriously, whenever I like a guy, it's like I'm just pathetic. Because, look at me. I'm a fucking train wreck. I have UGLY brassy brown hair with black roots, my eyes are flourescent green, and my skin is pale as Xerox paper. Nobody normal would like that. And, to make it worse, I fall for a type. The dark haired, blue/green/grey eyed, tall and deep with feelings type. It's so stupid. And now I have tears in my eyes... because this song reminds me of... him. Photography by the Starting Line. OH FUCK HERE COME THE TEARS. *lip trembles*

I'll swing from a streetlight... as I... will sing oh oh oh. I'm stuck in the meantime, but we're so oh so oh close. The sunlight's overwhelming the scene that's composed of you and me. And our finest moments. An amazing illusion was made with trick photography. It seems like you're really, you're really it seems like you're really here. I'll swing from a streetlight... as I... will sing oh oh oh. I'm stuck in the meantime, but we're so oh so oh close. </3

SIIIIIGH. Such a good song. And now I bid you, my loves, goodnight. *sigh* Make it a good one. Don't drink and drive... drink and get high =] I'll swing from a streetlight... as I... will sing oh oh oh. I'm stuck in the meantime, but we're so oh so oh close. KEN FROM THE STARTING LINE... yeah. Sexy. I sing oh oh oh. I sing oh oh oh. I sing oh oh oh.

Love,
Karissa<3"

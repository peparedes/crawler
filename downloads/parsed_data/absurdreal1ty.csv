"event","""After the nationwide vote, Carly... You are leaving us.""

Carly`s out? No wait, I think the real question is... WHY AM I STILL WATCHING THIS SHOW?!

...Because of David Archuleta. =))=)) Not kidding. Oh, and last night was Andrew Lloyd Webber night... And I can't miss THAT. That`s like awesome. Okay, let me be a critic and review each contestant's performance last night.

<strong>Syesha</strong>. Oh, she was really good. She sang my favorite song from Starlight Express, ""One rock and roll too many."" Yesyes. She started on the wrong beat, but she sang it incredibly. An excellent choice of song. Sir Andrew was impressed with her, I could tell.

<strong>Jason</strong>. The man with the dreads. MEMORY?! You sang MEMORY?!?!?! I think that song was way off his range. Okay, he Jasonified it and whatever, but dude, so not the song for you. I don't think he thought well about what song to sing. In my opinion, he could`ve sung one of those Che Guevara songs [as in Antonio Banderas in Evita] like ""Oh What A Circus"" and he could`ve even played the guitar. Ay Caliente. :"">

<strong>David A</strong>. My boyfriend's perfect, the end. HAHA. In contrast to what Simon said, I thought it was a really memorable performance. He made Think Of Me sound like a pop song. And I have utmost respect for anybody who can do that. Also, he sang it really well, pitch-perfect, as always.

<strong>Brooke</strong>. She sang You Must Love Me from Evita. My God, I LOVE that song. I think vocally, the performance was so-so... But she was spot-on with the emotional factor. Good job, Brooke. I feel `ya.

<strong>Carly</strong>. Awesome song choice. Only criticism: You should`ve sung the song in a few keys lower. When you hit the high notes, you were straining. Other than that, I loved it to bits ! :)

<strong>David C</strong>. The reason why I can never judge is because I`m usually biased from the start. And David Cook is one of those people that really can`t please me. Like Carrie Underwood [although I do admit she`s much better now.]. I mean, when he sings, his eyes are so empty... Emotionless. It bothers me. But vocally, he really is awesome. But Chris Daughtry already conquered the role of American Idol resident rocker, honey. I refuse to let you take it.

OKAY MOVING ON...
Yesterday and today... We had HATE SESSIONS. One by one we say what we hate. FUN FUN FUN. I volunteered to go first. =)) And Marie... took two hours. @-) Kidding. =)) Haha, love you Marie. :D =))

Hate sessions are alattafan. :)"

"event","So I haven't posted an actual blog entry in the longest time... And here I go.

I'm using Xjournal, it's like an application where you can create your blog even if you're offline and it automatically posts later on when you connect to the internet and whatever so yeah. :))

Keeping a blog takes discipline. @-) Which I don't have, apparently.

Right now, I'm watching Idol Gives Back, it's ending na, but whatever. MICHAEL JOHNS YOU SO HOT HOT HOT HOT. =)) And Brad Pitt, too. :D:D:D David Archuleta's a given.

Okay, so I joined Rep again this year. THANK YOU, CHRISSIE. :|:|:| =))=)) But, no, really, I'm enjoying it so far. :)

<strong><em>day.one.INTRODUCTIONS.</em></strong>
So Dani, Chrissie, and I [Dasma carpool buds] went to Rep at one but since Dani had to enroll and everything, we got to class a bit late. When we got there, I saw a few familiar faces already. They were playing a game where you had to give yourself an adjective that starts with the same letter of your name. Then memorize everyone else's. :)) It wasn't that hard. Craaaazy Chrissie! :))

Then we did log rolls. :| Yes you heard right. It's the most dreadful thing in the world!!!! :| But hella funny. Especially Sam, who was beside me. She was like screaming the whole time. =)) ""OUCH! OOOHHH MYYY GOOOD! HER STILETTOS!!!"" ""Don't worry! We trust you!"" Amp! =))

Lalalalaaaa.

<strong><em>day.two.TRUST.</em></strong>
Day two consisted mostly of... People being thrown around... Literally. And more introductions. :)) Highlights?
""I'm Chrissie. I like Barney.""
""I'm Kyle. My parents forced me to join Rep.""
HAHAHA. =))=))

<strong><em>day.three.FOCUS.</em></strong>
Okay, so the usual mirror exercises and tongue twisters. Pheasant plucker! Whatever the weather. And I don't remember the others.

Now that I think about it, it's amazing how it seems that we do so little each meeting, but we seriously have SO MUCH FUN! =))

And now my parents are at the Duran Duran concert. :| Not kidding. =)) I wanna go. :( I wanted to watch Swing Out Sister. :( =))

Yes, I watched Across the Universe. FINALLY. I can't believe that movie didn't win that Oscar. It was nominated though, for a Grammy and a Golden Globe.

Every single performance in Across the Universe is better than a really really really good American Idol performance during the Lennon/McCartney night. Really.

And speaking of American Idol, David Archuleta is my not-so-new love. While everybody was obsessing over Josiah Leming and how the whole living-in-the-car thing was so hot, I had a thing for David Archuleta and his John Mayer audition. Or maybe I just have a thing for John Mayer. Haha.

Brooke is my favorite female contestant this season. I swear, she is too awesome. And of course I love David A., then Michael, `cause they're just both too hot. :""> But Jason-man-with-the-dreads is cool.

Okay, here's the thing. Chikeze and Kristy-or-Kirsty should just go and die. Seriously.

Well, summer so far's been... Uneventful. I caught my mom's cough, which turned into ""Respiratory Tract Infection"" on Monday and I just recovered from it yesterday. Been staying in Bel-Air, watching DVDs on the new 42"" LCD HD TV, and watching Ugly Betty. [Stupid writers' strike.]

And, yeah, watching Across the Universe. That, too.

But don't think of me as the contact-hungry blogger. I've seen most of my contacts at school, and the other people are just friends of lots of my close friends. Hm.

The last post I posted was fifteen weeks ago. FIFTEEN! I can't believe I've ignored LJ for so long. Blogging is soooo... Unburdensome. For lack of a better word.

Anyways, today was like the last official day of class of my freshman year. I mean, that's not like a major milestone or anything, but it's still tragic. We ate cake and lemon squares courtesy of Pia and Lara during Math Enrichment. And we ranted about EVERYTHING.

And then it hit me. Seniors. We're never gonna see them again. I mean, of course we'll see a few of them again at some point in our lives, but we won't encounter them on a daily basis anymore. No more having Ate's in Kapatiran, no one to defend the freshmen. Yes, they've left us out in open water. Vulnerable to every predator. Whether it be Sophomores, Juniors, or a teacher abundantly supplied with stress, Seniors are always supposed to be there.

But they're gone now.

I LOVE our Seniors. I really do. I can't imagine High School without them being there.

<b>I want Freshman year to last forever.</b>
I don't care if we have to RE-LEARN Ibong Adarna or if we've got to undergo the whole Merchant of Venice Shylock soliloquy process all over again. I just don't want it to end. Not now, it's too soon.

"event","Retreat was probably one of the most enlightening experiences of my life. I came back from Assumption Antipolo Tuesday afternoon feeling very light and unburdened.

I woke up early out of excitement. Since I packed the night before, all I had to do was stuff my toothbrush in and I was ready to leave. When I got to school I was all, OMG. I forgot to make palancas. How could I forget??? So once I got to one of the tables at the Assumpta Court, I put down my Nike duffel (sp?) bag and started writing palancas. Of course, being really distracted, I only accomplished making three that day. So yeah, I'm sorry to everyone I didn't make palancas for. :)

Then after everybody arrived, we went on the bus to go to Antipolo. On our way there, we stopped at a gasoline station and bought ice cream, chips, cookies, chocolate, gatorade, water, and anything else we could afford. Then we got back to the bus and drove off again. Until we saw floods up ahead. Knee high. Brown water. Kids swimming. Gross.

Then we arrived and had morning snacks or recess or whatever you wanna call it. :)) Our speaker would arrive later on that day <i>pa</i> so we had free time. And this is where the boredom begins.

Bella: What should I name my party?
Us: Sotanghon. Bella's thing. Crisis. Candid Camera Cotton Candy Corner. Smack That. Soulja girl. Grounded.

And ten million other retarded names. <i>Are you going to Sotanghon?</i>





On Wednesday, we had the Booth Auction. Our section got the lowest amount of points. Five hundred something. IV-2 got 71,000+. Our class' booths are Taters and Karaoke. It's KKK all over again, I'm telling you. But only this time, it's twice (or maybe even thrice) the work, stress, and trouble. I mean, convincing people to be a speaker for two, four, or six hours is hard enough... But to make them supply an entire booth for some two-day school fair is a totally different story.

Varsity night was loads of fun, but before I dwell on that, let me tell you about my ""fun"" filled day.

It was drizzling. Again. So yeah, like yesterday, it was really cold. The special periods on Fridays are THE and Clubs so THE was such a drag. I mean, me make a skirt for a little public school student? The skirt ended up fitting ME. So yeah, I hope our teacher doesn't notice, `cause she's known to be a very precise person. Please, oh please let the little public school student gain weight so she'll fit into it.

My seatmate was absent today (well, she arrived during clubs), and I was kind of sad `cause I wanted to go on Varsity-night's-later-omgomgomg mode with her. At least my other seatmate made up for it by being super high, too. And so was the rest of the class. So why am I complaining?

Well, nothing eventful during class today. Just a certain student and her ""knuckle-action"" during Filipino. Ah God.

So during Lunch, we had KKK late registration. But before that, all Facilitators had to meet at the AV1. Unfortunately, a few courses got dissolved. Like Barista for a day... Apparently it's like CHILD LABOR to work in Starbucks if you're underaged. And EK for a day. The 20th is maintenance day. Just our luck.

Well, I still don't know with my speaker if Flag Football's gonna be in Ateneo... `Cause if it's not, it's in the Friendship Garden. Yes, that patch of grass near the construction. That's not gonna be fun. :( Ah, oh well. At least I already have transpo.

Anyways, the student council assembly was really HILARIOUS. Like in the middle of the president's announcements, some guys in the High School Ateneo uniform passed behind the podium, so OF COURSE everyone looked. And our president couldn't stop laughing...

Varsity night was A W E S O M E of course. My old classmate who moved to another school actually CAME. Yes, you know who you are. >:D< Thanks so much for coming.

Then alot of my guy friends. I won't name names but I was kind of pissed with a few of them. Some of you know who I mean. ;)

Dance Troupe, Pep, Hardcourt, Hyped you guys were AWESOME. >:D< And of course, Volleyball, Badminton, Tennis, and Soccer. ;) I loved (almost) all the presentations. :D The bands were kind of droll though. Ah well.

More tomorrow.

I made a new LJ, obviously. Nobody even logs in to Xanga anymore... And I like my new layout. So there. Oh, and just to let you know, I won't be naming names here. For... personal reasons.

Today was... COLD. I mean, God, it's a tropical country. The only reason people move here is so that they don't have to freeze to death in Canada or whatever.

The ironic thing is, people still migrate to Canada.

My clock says it's 32 celsius... Wait, that can't be right... And apparently it's also still September 27. Gotta get this clock repaired.

Okay, just checked my Dashboard (don't you just love Macs?) and it's 23 degrees celsius. It feels like 15. Wind was blowing, rain was pouring... And heads were hurting.

Don't know. It must be the weather? But during math today, I swear, my head started hurting. Maybe it was the fact that someone started a game called ""Kill seven brain cells by hitting people on the head!"" I swear, that was NOT a good idea. (7, 14, 21, 35...)

Or maybe it was because we had Filipino and Don Juan became a player. Donya Juana. Seriously. Who falls in love with someone whose name is exactly the opposite sex version of yours? I mean, okay, my great grandparents are Antonio and Antonia. But nobody exactly wants to name their baby girl Donya Juana.

Or maybe it was that Unit Tests are coming up. Or KKK.

KKK. The excuse to rip people's blouses off. Seriously. One girl's shirt got stabbed with a pen so it tore. Okay, so you didn't get the course you wanted, but you don't have to stab some random innocent bystander with a WRITING INSTRUMENT. I mean, how low can you go? Oh, and don't rip people's sleeves off, either. Apparently, sleeves didn't do anything to hurt you (unless you've got some traumatic experience involving fabric on people's shoulders, but whatever).

I got some of my friends in Flag Football, but courses were limited so they're still gonna sign up for late registration tomorrow. Please Lord, let them get slots! It's not that I'm not happy with who signed up already (I am, I really am), it's just that I don't want my friends to go to pottery or something.

Oh, and the most unlikely person is an orphanage worker for a day. Of course she's going to be absent. I mean, it's too good to be true.

I am, of course, the facilitator for Flag Football and Jazz. Flag's really cool. And Jazz is okay, I guess. I'm just happy that a few of my friends also signed up for that! Yes, so some people are taking both courses with me for the entire day! I am not alone.

I haven't written a blog entry in forever, so I'm typing like MAD now. I didn't realize it was so much fun to rant out! :D

Oh no, I just got a text saying Facis meeting 12:15 av. Four words. But everyone knows what that means. ATTEND OR DIE. My life's in the hands of the AV room. Sigh.

Fair's in approximately 66 days. I am not as excited as last year. Of course, being VP of the class doesn't solve anything. I am going to be so stressed when fair comes up. I mean, for KKK, I was already up until here with schoolwork, plus Chorale, plus KKK, plus the death of my paternal grandfather! I mean, GIVE THE FRESHMAN A BREAK!

Well, it's getting pretty cold, and I still need to make Palancas and finish my stupid Algebra homework. Not to mention, try planning a soiree with Southridge and winning a million dollars. Okay, maybe I don't need to do the last one right now, but it would be extremely helpful. Then I could move to Canada and buy all the blankets in the world, in case I get cold.

Toodles."

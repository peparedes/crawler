I only cheated to make it a more entertaining post.

abe- Because he's a really great penis...er, president.

classic rock- I grew up on this stuff.  How could I not like it?  Even if I didn't grow up on it, how could I not?  And what's wrong with my ""R"" key?

first kisses- Duh.  The first kiss with someone new is always a rush.  And they often make good stories later.  So, how could I not love them?

intelligence-Stupid people bug the crap out of me.  Get some freakin brains!

kissing left/right- This is one of my unique livejournal intrests.  Meaning, nobody else has it listed.  And it's really an interesting conversation starter: When initiating a kiss, do you tilt your head to the left or the right?

musicals- Only the greatest things ever!  They combine the greatness of instrumental music, vocal music, and drama all into one great fantastic product.  They require a great quantity of people with great quantites of skill to pull off so when they come out good, you know that the program must really rock.  Plus, most of my greatest memories while playing trumpet are in the musical pits.  Frktn!  Now, if I could only figure out what ""tacet"" means...

percy- Just for the record, I'm really upset that I passed 'orgasms'  Percy is the lawn flamingo that me and Emma liberated the summer before our junior year.  He's named after Sir Percy in The Scarlet Pimpernel.  He has a crack in his neck, but wears a Harry Potter bandaid.

rocko's modern life- Seriously, this show was the shiznit.  I wish I had it on DVD.  Or, for that matter, that they made it on DVD.

sexuality theories- Nature vs. Nurture?  Again, just something fun to discuss and study.  Why do some people like boys while others like girls?  Why does it matter at all?  I mean, barely anybody finds people sexually attractive only if they have red hair, so why should they only find them attractive if they have a penis?  How much of it is simply society's implications playing out?  I find it all incredably intriging.

stick pens- The pens that I bought for college were labeled as ""stick pens"" and I just thought it was really funny.  I mean, almost all pens are shaped like sticks, so why do they feel the need to label them as stick pens?  I don't really understand, but it's hilarious.

thunder storms-  They're amazing.

wrestling in public- It's fun and people look at you funny.  And, the best part of all, you get to touch people.  I'm a touch whore.  I really am."

And I thought, hey, I never did that.  That sounds like fun!  But, alas, I was not that type of middle schooler.  I liked two people when I was at Pacific.  And I still like them both today.  Despite the fact that I've barely talked to one of them since.  And that the other is completely unreasonable.  Whatever.  They both come way closer to perfect than anyone who's actually been around.  Well...yeah.  Okay.  Yes.  Than anyone.  Which is stupid because I was 13.  What the hell?

Went outside to bring the garbage can in.  It hit me halfway down my driveway.  I stopped to consider for a moment and pulled my hoodie off.  It's the kind of day that's so perfectly end-of-August it's hard to believe it's real.  It's warm, but not too warm.  You can wear shorts if you want to, but you don't have to.  Blue skies with accompaning clouds.  Everything seems fresh from the rain yesterday and there's a scent and electricity in the air of new beginnings.  Impending newness on the horizon.

Mr. Nowacki told 6th period the results from his previous 3 periods and although the issues were overwhelmingly democraticly voted upon, the front side had a 58% Bush lead.  Incredably upsetting, and I'm not saying this because I want Kerry to win (although I do).  This means that a large number of people don't know where the candidates stand on the issues.  And at this age many people are still in tune with their parents on political views.  Notice the many, not all or even most.  So, this now means that many people's parents in the area are going to go out and vote uninformed.  I'm a strong believer of voting on the issues, not the party, and, from the looks of at least the psychology faction of egreen, people around here don't.

anyway.  so here's the lowdown- me and jason want to go to the kiggins double feature (harry potter 3 and shrek 2), but i dont drive and he doesnt drive legally so someone should volunteer to go with us who drives because we dont like walking that far and we're cool people who like to hang out with other cool people and how am i doing on making a coherent sentence?  so volunteer, itll be great fun and you can even feel free to bring your boy/girlfriend to come along, even if its of the same sex because we oppose measure 36.

"event","I was going to censor this so certain people couldn't read it, but i decided not to because it's my fucking journal and i'm protected by the first amendment.

I strongly feel that what the section leaders did tonight- the before practice stuff, the sectional lectures, and the ""sl's in the middle"", the whole nine yards- was extraordinarily uncalled for and inappropriate.  and remember, i've been a section leader, i understand how difficult it is to encourage people while keeping their respect, but this was way out of line.  the entire thing was designed to seperate the sl's from the rest of the band as if they're goD's gift to the EMB while the rest of us are the scum of the earth and worth no more than the crud they scrap off the bottom of their shoes.  Bad move guys, this is not the way effective leaders work.  Effective leaders are well liked.

There are two ways that we, as a band, can have fun during a marching season.  The first is by making the decision of going for that sweepstakes trophy everytime and everybody works hard and it's a blast being hardcore.  The fun comes from what you get back and the feeling when you hit the last big halt at the championship performance.  The other way to have fun is to accept a slightly lower slot on the rankings and just have a blast learning and performing the show.  We enjoy rehersals because we get to laugh and enjoy the company of those around us and we can still enjoy competing because we would still have the potetial to be top 5 and that's plenty of excitment.  The main fun here comes from remembering all the great times you had with all the new friends you;ve made during rehersal.  Both ways are awesomely fun.  Both ways are acceptable to me.  The fact is, I thought we had already choosen the second one to let the band as a program take a breather for a few years after hardcoreness.  I guess we're not allowed to.

And this one has been bugging me all seasion but, yes, even more so now that we cant see yardlines all the time.  When you're marching, you dress the form.  when you're at dress set, you dress the form.  and when he says to find your dot, you find you're fucking dot!  if you look far down the yardlines you can see them and people saying, ""we can't dress behind us"" is just bullshit because we're not talking about dressing, we're talking about when we have time to stop and set the form correctly.  STOP BEING A DUMBASS!
and the person that last one was emphasized on will know if they read it.

I go out on the field and i march well and i play well.  that's my job.  and i'm getting sick of people giving me crap.  and i'm sick of people giving the band crap.  this is neither of the ways to have fun.  this is the way to get a 40% return rate for next year's marching program."

Somebody with a blue truck...i couldn't see the driver.  Anyway, this was at like 7:48 this morning and when i looked at my digital clock part of the 7 was cut off from my view and i read it as a 1.  then i'm like holy cow, how did i sleep in til nearly 2?!?!  so i bolted up and went to go get on the internet to see who was trying to play with me and had come over in a blue truck when i see another clock.  oh fuck, it sucked.  i hate eye trickery and people who ring doorbells early.  anyway, i did get back to sleep and just woke back up now...a very reasonable hour.

I very destinctly remember him saying freshmen year that the reason we didn't stand with our toes apart was because some stood at a perfect 45 degrees while some end up too big or too small and it looks just plain messy.  Now what does he want us to do?  Stand with our toes apart.

Last year, direct quote here: ""A jazz show is the downfall of a good marching program.""  What does he want to do next year?  A jazz show.  Thank goD I'm graduating.

"event","on your current playlist, hit shuffle and pick the first 20 songs on the list ( no matter how cheesy or embarassing) and write down your favorite line of the song. try and avoid putting the song title in the lyrics. then have your friends comment and see if they know the songs.

Well, my computer is bad with this whole shuffling thing and I kept getting midis of marching songs or classical music or musical overtures in my first 20...all of which have no lyrics.  So I'm just going to go off of some of my mix playlists, nobody will ever know.   Except everyone who reads this because I just told you.

1. You see right through me and I can't hide.
2. Life is not what I thought it was...I am not who I thought I was...
3. I played the part and took the blame while you pretend nothing is real
4. But whatever road you choose I'm right behind you, win or lose
5. We'll be falling in love To the rhythm of a steel drum band
6. Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.  Now I need a place to hide away.
7. I wanted more than life could ever grant me
8. I can spell confusion with a 'K' and I can like it
9. But you're searching just like everyone, could be anyone.
10. How the devil can I ever prevail when I'm only a man
11. Spread your tiny wings and fly away
12. Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even St. Elmo's Fire
13. Cause even when I dream of you, the sweatest dream'll never do, i'd still miss you, babe
14. I drive off in my car but whichever way I go I come back to the place you are
15. With all their hockey hubbabaloo  And that bitch Anne Murray too
16. A great big truck ran her over and chopped off her head
17. I'm So Confused, Will You Show To Me, You'll Be There For Me
18. I am one of those melodramtic fools
19. (Don't be sad that i have to feel this way got nothing  just keep making the same fuckin mistakes over and over and over again can't the fucking mistake be over)
20. I'm not a robot without emotions-I'm not what you see

"event","I think the whole concept of being ""homesick"" when you go other places for extended periods of time (i.e. camp, college) is all backwards.  I find myself being campsick when I get home.  With few exceptions, you arrive at camp knowing no one.  Human nature is to want to be close to people and have people to care about.  So when you arrive at camp the people you sit next to, room with, and other various nice people end up becoming quick and very important friends.  And sharing something so passionate as music with them makes it all the deeper.  And so by the end of the week you're in love with around 15 or so people.  Then on the last day, the parents show up and everyone splits of to them with no regards to the people they've been living on top of for the past week.  The final concert is performed and you put your instrument away and just leave.  Just walk away.  Zero closure.

Coming soon: music camp quotes!!  Good, sometimes clean fun for the musical and nonmusical alike!

p.s.- I have a new journal, ironmysandwich, and as of now it has nothing that any of you would be interested in, but it may in the future.  I havent completely switched over yet and i may never, but since i'm playing horn next year, this lj is kindda defunct."

i answered honestly and i didn't click a single republican one.  i hesitated a bit on the abortion one because i don't believe in it, but the democratic choice supported that, too, while the republican choice sounded like whoever was saying it was high.  meh, go librals.  and U.U.s."

"event","its way late and i can't sleep...this sucks.

i thought i was having a good day for a while, then i think i got over it.

it seems like whenever i really like someone they always want to spend all of they're time hanging out with people i don't really like.  or people that i like enough not to hate, no matter how much it sometimes seems i should.  i guess im just way too much of the jealous type or i fall for the wrong people.  probably both.

on another note, do you ever wonder why people seem to think it's okay to have multiple boyfriends?  i mean, usually only one has the actual title, but if you see them just hanging out, you can't tell the difference.  choose one, ladies, i realize it may be hard, but it'll hurt less in the long run."

ok, so i don't mean to be unflexable here, but if plans are made and it turns out they have to be changed, shouldnt they be changed to include the same people so it doesnt qualify as ditching?"

"event","damn hazel dell old winery, it's of the devil. i swear.  they wouldnt let me flag where i wanted to, they said i was ""too close to the street""  when emma was across the street the same distance away.  they made me wear a sign around my neck.  we had to ask for dinner break, as if it wasnt made our right as part of the contract.  every since shift change came late, except when i had a good job.  no matter where i put my chair while working the exit, somebody had a problem with it.  brian didn't have an assigned job the entire time i was there, he just went around playing his snare and randomly cutting open boxes.  how come he doesnt have to do the f*cking exit?  I was stuck doing the singles bins until 15 minutes after i was off and then i wasn't even switched by our shift manager, but one of the nice ladies that actually works for the owners took over.  and then, worst of all, THEY WOULDN'T LET US WEAR APRONS OUTSIDE!

"event","if the actual school part of school has taught me one big life lesson so far, it's that that everything always falls into place.  i don't think this is a very fair lesson for them to teach me as when i start applying to colleges and then in college working on things there, getting a job, a house, whatever, its not always going to be like that.  but at least as far as ive gotten in school so far, i've been able to completely procrasitinate and not pay attention and go home and take a nap rather than doing homework and what has it gotten me?  a 4.0 .   thanks for teaching me responsibility evergreen.

not that it's entirely their fault, they havent completely raised me.  but i'll always remember the time when i hadnt even started my biology (6th per.) project upon arriveing to school the day it was due and not only got an A on it, but extra credit, as well.  see kids, procrastination is good for you!

i better just stop this rant now because all im going to get back are a bunch of comments telling me to learn responsibility myself and that i should know better anyway, but the point is that you learn things like these from experience (unless you're some kind of natural prude who does their hw before even going to the bathroom), and they're experiences that i havent have.  meh, its summer, screw responsibility."

"event","mr. ormson said something really inspirational this morning when they were talking to me about why they didnt pick me as drum major.  he said that you have to learn to be more aware of the way other people are interpretting things because the way they percieve reality is the only reality they have.  i understand what they mean in terms of me being hard-nosed and not really caring how other people think of me, but the way i percieve reality is

damn, i don;t even know where im going with this.  the fact of the matter is that today sucked and a lot due to the fact that nobody seems to perceive reality the way i do.  and theres this stupid fly that wont leave me alone flying around the screen.  but what im guess i meant to mean is that im sick of people who call my views ignorant because they have ignorant views that they can't see around.  and maybe i should try to realize that their ignorance is reality to them, but how can someone blantently ignore modern science and other changes in soceity when veiwing their so-called ""reality?""  it just doesnt make any sense to me.  their thought process is none existant in my reality."

"event","i feel like such an idiot.  everybody wrote in their posts about how much they cried over the seniors last night at awards night.  i'm here thinking, damn, i cried hard last night, but not because of the seniors.  that's really all i have to say.  i left the minute the slideshow was over, didnt even say goodbye to anyone or pass around my yearbook.  just wanted to leave before i lost it in front of everyone.  i really felt bad afterwards because i shouldn't have left before cleanup was all taken care of.  damn me and feeling responsible for things getting done in this program.

i don't know how i could feel so selfish and so overly commited to the good of the group at the same time.  and feel like a loser for both.  it's times like this when i just want somebody to hold me and assure me that everything will work out.

i now i feel like a loser for sounding melodramatic.  but i really dont think i am being melodramatic because a huge dream of mine just got crushed."

Sidebar...Mo..i read your response to my last entry.&nbsp; I guess you are right..i was just going through a rough time with some stuff and was a little..i don't know what to say..down..depressed..upset..cheated...long story..but i hope its resolved now..and trying to work on getting things back to normal.


so an update..&nbsp;i still hate driving..and still hate driivng to and from mississauga..can't wait to get out of here and back to the east end!!&nbsp;&nbsp;and i still think that i should be employed at making those signs above the 401 ..i could come up with things so much better than ""express moving slowly"" or ""collector moving very slowly"".&nbsp; They need something more exciting to read..or some jokes to make you chuckle as you are driving in.. and no i am not a distracted driver!! I have seen some crazy stuff...you know i saw a guy marking papers on the 401 (sure traffic was slow...but marking papers?!) 

work is insane and i gotta find a new job before i go completely and utterly insane.&nbsp; Work is going to suck now that the majority of my line are ..i can't even think of a word for them right now..but anyways i gotta get outta there and find something else..someone mention pharmaceutical sales LOL..

anyways..just can't sleep and i can't find much else to write right now ..other than i am really sleeping..and why did lakisha kiss simon on american idol? that kinda baffled me and i think she was forced!

and i can't wait for COTTAGE!!!! are we booked yet??

ok enough rambling..i will write something more substantial next time."

"event","<p>I watch Grey's Anatomy every thursday..and every thursday I get annoyed that they portray that doctors doing everything..when really was the last time you saw a doctor hang and IV med..i mean come on!!&nbsp; BUT todays was the best...the residents had to change the bed sore dressings and come to reposition the patient every 2 hours!!!! THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN!! I would like for one day for the doctors to fill a spot in a nurses shoes to see what the hell we actually deal with.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong..I am positive there are many things about their job that I would not like to go through...but I think part of their training would be to see what we actually do...especially when we can't run off the unit like they do.&nbsp; I just think its amusing how they portray those doctors doing a lot of the nurses role.&nbsp; I also think their should be a TV show that shows what nurses do and what we have to put up with (although I don't think it would do very well for recruiting new grads!!)<br /><br /></p>"

"event","We went house hunting on the weekend...Found a couple very nice ones that we are interested in (all not built).&nbsp; One in particular that i really like...funny enough if we actually took it we would be neighbours to James and Renee!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Not just neighbours but we can spy on them from across the street!!!&nbsp; We are going to look one more weekend and then we may figure out which one we want.&nbsp; We have narrowed the area down to ajax so we have done most of our looking there.&nbsp; Its exciting..but then to know just how long it will take to build plus delays..is a little frustrating!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Also i think i am getting better at reading floor plans although seeing a model is just so much better!

However i gotta stay positive that i will make it outta mississauga one day soon..and be back to living on my own...i really miss it!!...Not to say that living here is bad..its actually very nice..its just the drive kills me and i miss just having my own space.&nbsp; I miss my apartments...yes i actually miss the MILLIES!!! actually speaking of which..i saw a millie here in the basement..freaked me out and reminded me of my first apartment..the millie infestation that kept me sleepless for so many nights!&nbsp; On second thought..i don't miss the millies..just the apartment..the feeling of it being my first place that kinda thing (i just got goosebumps with all the millie talk).

On another note...EVRON..i finished season one of 24 and was extremely upset that they killed terry.&nbsp; I did not expect that and i was very upset..i did send you a text expressing my extreme upsetment.&nbsp; It is a good show tho..you did get my hooked..i am going to start season 2 tonight..."

"event","So new years was a lot of fun.&nbsp; We had a good many people here at the&nbsp; house (in sauga).&nbsp; Everyone complied with the Jammies only rule and it was a fun night of games, drinking, eating and drinking :)&nbsp; it was a nice way to ring in the new year...

Work had been insane crazy...i actually (for the first time in my seven years of nursing) ended up with shit and blood on my uniform..it was so bad i had to change into a pair of nasty hosp scrubs!!&nbsp; Not a fun day at all!!&nbsp; I also find myself in charge all the time..its hard to do with a full patient assignment and we all know when I am in charge there is for sure some huge issue that needs to be solved.

Also i found out some very sad news today..It almost hurts me to type it out.&nbsp; After four years, the OC is being cancelled after this season.&nbsp; The last epi airs feb 22.&nbsp; I am deeply hurt that they would do this.&nbsp; I love that show and it has changed my thursdays completely.&nbsp; Now i am going to have to resort to watching all the old seasons on dvd.&nbsp; Very very depressing.

Ok now i am too saddened to type any more of this blog.&nbsp; However I will mention that i have four well deserved days off now!!"

I also would like to say that i actually despise the stores around xmas and boxing day...its insane..people cannot drive, people use their childrens strollers as weapons, people get greedy and pushy, there are insane lineups, there is crappy merchandise, there is no merchandise, and there is no parking.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a pact with myself this year to finish my shopping way before xmas...which almost happened..just a few gifts to get right before xmas..so i did have to go into that mosh pit somewhat.&nbsp; I didn't go shopping on boxing day (due to having to work) but i did venture out to best buy on the 27th.&nbsp; It was madness in there..lucky for me i found a parking spot right away but in the store was nuts and the line up was insane..i still bought a lot of stuff tho (i got a really cool bluetooth headset guys!!)&nbsp; I may tempt the stores tomorrow...we'll see...

"event","ok..so working day shift turns out to be way better than working night shift...In the morning i leave at six..but get to work for about 645am or so..i would rather be there earlier rather than later..and i was told if i leave any later than six i am screwed traffic wise... 

Coming home there is barely any traffic so i leave roughly at 745pm and get home at 815-820pm.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Only bad thing is i am been working like crazy.&nbsp; I try to do at least one OT shift a pay and i take it payed out.&nbsp; Now i have been trying to do two (take one payed and bank one).&nbsp; Looking at my vacation hours..they are next to nothing SO if we want to go on a honeymoon in a couple of months i have to build up my bank or else I can't take time off.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only bad thing about this (besides being run down) is that its hard to see Shane...especially since by the time i get home..take a shower..its time for bed. I think that i am going to have to scatter the OT ...for example one pay take one OT..the next pay take two OT..etc.. (yeah there is mad crazy overtime available on my unit!!). 

Another thing i hate doing is waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sitting here..at 838am on my day off..waiting for the bell guy to come and install another line from the satellite to our room so we can get tv.&nbsp; They say they will come between 8-12 but i want him to hurry and get here so i can go to sleep.&nbsp; Its my day off!!&nbsp; Always my luck that they end up coming at 1155am,

"event","<p>Since i have a long drive to and from work every day that gives me time to ponder things..specially do to traffic.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Why are there so many cars on the road?</p>
<p>Why do people drive like retards in rush hour?</p>
<p>Can someone invent a car like in that commercial where we can just levitate over the other cars to get places faster?</p>
<p>Why doesn't someone invent a mezzanine system for the 401 where you can choose to take the upper level or the underground one?</p>
<p>Why do people pick their noses while driving?</p>
<p>How do i get a job changing those overhead bulletins on the 401 (i wouldn't put express moving slowly..i would put express moving as fast as a turtle, collectors skipping along...make it a little more interesting..or maybe just fuck people up and put funny jokes..or the 407 would have been your better choice sucker!!)<br /><br />What would happen if i just drove along the shoulder to get to work?</p>

"event","After three and a half years of absolute freedom of living on my own, I am back living in a parents house.&nbsp; Although&nbsp;I never said it would happen it did.&nbsp; I was so against the idea in the beginning but i guess after many long talks with my husband we realized that it may be our smartest decision to save money and to buy the house we have always wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The move went very well yesterday.&nbsp; Special thanks to Mike, Neil, Ryan, Janoa and Brett for making the move go so well.&nbsp; Now I am stuck with trying to find space for an apartments worth of stuff and then some that i have accumulated.&nbsp; I think we just need to get another set of dresser drawers and we will be good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Shane's mom is nice so i don 't think it will be so hard living here but its just the loss of control and freedom that come withs living on your own.&nbsp; Those who have been there know what i mean.&nbsp; It kinda feels like you are back to square one and the proud that you felt on providing for yourself is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also its the thought that this is someone elses house and you have to act a certain way...and the hope that you aren't inconvinencing anyone too much because they were kind enough to offer their house to you and try to make you as comfortable as possible (which both Shane's mom and Shannon have done)I guess i will get used to these things over time and i will do absolutely anything to be where my husband is so i guess&nbsp; i will have to make the sacrifice.&nbsp; Hopefully we will be house hunting soon and that will give me something to look forward too!

One thing i don't think I will get used to is the drive.&nbsp; Every since highschool (where i had to take that 45min sometimes one hour bus ride) and ryerson (two hour bus ride) i vowed just to move close to wherever i am going to need to be.&nbsp; Hence the move to kennedy and lawrence when i work mostly at scarborough gen, and the move to eglinton and vic park when i worked mostly at sunnyb.&nbsp; I love my sleep..any added sleep and less transportation is great for me!!&nbsp; Tonight is my first night shift drive in..we'll see how that goes!

Now onto money saving time!!!!"

"event","Well its been a nice two weeks off work...I have done absolutely nothing..or yeah i have ...just not to the degree of craziness that i am used to.&nbsp; I slept in almost every day...packed a little...went back to the gym....went shopping with my husband (that sounds so weird) then had a&nbsp;BIG MARRIED DINNER&nbsp;with james and renee..SOME DELICIOUS FOOD!! I DREAMT OF IT!! &nbsp;and also tried to change my name on some of my ID (which was quite an experience).

First off i must say that Scotia and rogers changed my last name to Alvares no problem..however my conversation with the service ontario government agent went like this...

Govy: Good afternoon service ontario so and so speaking...
Me: Hi, i just got married and was wondering how i go about changing my last name to my husbands (seems like a normal question)
Govy:why do you want to change it?
me: i just got married..i am taking my husbands name
govy:why do you want to change it so quickly? is there a reason?
me: no i am just excited! and want to change all my ID
govy: you cannot change your name
me:what? why not?
govy: there is not such thing
me: yes there is
govy: no...you can assume his name...to do this you need to apply for a legal copy of your marriage certificate..and you have to make sure the church has sent all the documents so that when we receive your application we can process it with no delays.&nbsp; Once you have done that (thru vitals statistics) and have&nbsp;a copy of your&nbsp;marriage certificate,&nbsp;then you call us back and department by department we will modify all your cards..
me: ok ...(thinking i must be psychic to know if the govy has received the church stuff) ok..i will do that..i just want to get all this name change stuff out of the way..
govy: &lt;signs&gt; &lt;gets angry&gt; BACK TO SQUARE ONE, YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR NAME...(and then starts repeating what i have to do again)
me: i understand what you are telling me..i will do that ok...(geez...)
govy:ok..how did you hear about us
me:from a friend
govy: why did she use our services
me:she just got married
govy:um ok, anything else
me: no
govy: ok have a nice day..thank you for choosing service ontario

PARANOID MUCH!!! geez..i am not a terrorist..i just want to change my last name..OR sorry assume Shane's last name..geez well i will apply next week and hopefully they will have got the church documents and can process my application..in the mean time i might try and use that solomization thingy they give you when you get married..see if that works.."

What it came down to was the three days before the wedding... <br /><br />Thursday..Rehearsal day.. <br />We met at the church. The lady conducting the rehearsal screwed everyone up and really we ended up leaving there like we didn't know any differently. We went to my moms house for the dinner and it was a lot of fun.

i was quickly told to shut up..&nbsp; I think about one i decided i should try and sleep so i journeyed off to the basement.&nbsp; I had trouble sleeping and then the rest of the girls came down and ren and shan decided to talk to the fish that were in the basement.&nbsp; I then made the mistake of telling them that just around the corner we had a turtle.&nbsp; They went in to look at DUFFY and found different names to call him and had some great fun with him..i think we finally passed out around 230.<br /><br />Saturday..the day of!<br />I woke up dead tired..took a quick shower and met char and stacey to get my hair and make up done.&nbsp; I also woke everyone else up too..we had our hair and make up done (my hair stayed perfectly the whole night i might add)..the other girls started to show and we were getting ready while eating breakfast.&nbsp; I was surprised at how i wasn't nervous yet.&nbsp; Then we all got ready..still wondering why the photo guy (who was supposed to show at 10) was not here.&nbsp; Then the call comes from Shane that the David (photo guy) went to my apartment and not my moms house so he would be late.&nbsp; I was a bit panicked but really how much time does he need with me.&nbsp; The rain was still a concern to me cause it was pouring out.&nbsp; However in my family its considered good luck to rain on the wedding day.&nbsp; Anyways the photographer came at around 1045 and started his pics..the rain stopped and the bus came.&nbsp; We got into the bus then i realized i had to pee..that was an experience.&nbsp; then back on the bus...I started getting nervous then...<br />We pulled up out front and ventured into the church.&nbsp; Everything pretty much fell into place and next thing i knew i was up front with my fiance.&nbsp; It was a little confusing because what the priest was doing was different from the rehersal but we adapted.&nbsp; The service was nice..and pretty much before you knew it we were saying our vows and putting our rings on each other..i confused shane a little because the priest said hold your right hand and my engagement ring was on that hand so shane thought that was my left...we signed and kissed and became husband and wife!! such an amazing feeling!!&nbsp; I also had my first communion that day..which for anyone who doesn't know i had been doing classes like crazy every weekend to convert to catholic before the wedding (august 24-06 was my confirmation).<br /><br />After that we got on the bus and gave the wedding party the gifts.&nbsp; We gave them jerseys and running shoes and engraved shot glasses...the party loved them!! we then went to have the pictures done at RIchmond green.&nbsp; It was VERY COLD LIKE WINTER there..people were saying they were cold and they had damn jackets on..i had nothing!!&nbsp; I think we got some good shots!&nbsp; We had some team pics taken with the wedding party wearing t heir jerseys..it was fun!&nbsp; After that we visited the cemetary to visit Jon and pay our respects..take a little shot of JD for him..then had some mickey d's..it hit the spot!&nbsp; I also went pee in that mcdonalds bathroom ..wheel chair washroom of course..and with Kim and Cailyns help (and picture taking...hey why does everyone take pics of me peeing!!) i managed to pee!<br /><br />We ended up at the hall...everyone went to do their duties..Shane and I greeted people..and then we had our personalized intros..which was fun and we came in with jerseys and shoes on!! parents weren't too impressed but the guests loved it!!&nbsp; Everything about the night was perfect..we had a lot of fun..the speeches were great..the slideshow that our parents did was nice..the slideshow that the no frills crew did was funny...and yes very tasteful good job james!!&nbsp; James aka <span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />slugger</span> did a wonderful job mcing.&nbsp; The food was great..although i couldnt' eat a lot of it cause i was worried about talking in front of people..i think i did manage to go up..didn't say much..actually don't remember what i said..but i said something ( and then something only select people know about..i went to the bridal suite and vomited after it..felt way better after that!!) I have to say i really appreciated my husbands attempts at trying to make me less nervous (he had everyone stand up..then told me that we could make them do whatever we wanted so i shouldn't be nervous) it was really cute and sweet.&nbsp; Only thing throughout the night that did go wrong was my dress kept undoing and needed to be pinned..i have to say a special thanks to ren for keeping my bum hidden..even while dancing to kayne lol i was pissed then about the dress&nbsp;but that didn't last too long.....and then we partied!! and partied!! and partied!!&nbsp; We all also went back to the hotel room and had some more mickey d's and drinks (baby duck!!)..then slowly one by one people passed out...<br /><br />It was nice to have all our friends and family there having a good time with us..&nbsp; I had a great time!&nbsp; I am so happy to be Mrs. Alvares now..i can't wait to my life ahead with my new husband!!&nbsp; And also happy to join the married crew!!&nbsp;<br /><br />also i will post pics when i get some<br /><br />oh and i LOVE My ipod that my husband bought me as a wedding gift (i got him his xbox 360)"

I hate when patients are babies...i had one lady (broken leg) pick up a cup last night and look in the mirror and put it down and say...""too tired""..DRINK THE DAMN WATER!!

I need to write a letter to American Idol....Chris should have never gone...what are people thinking?????????

Who decided that Red should always mean stop and green should always mean go..what if we changed it around and made pink as go and blue as stop?? 

I love the commercial where all four cars are stopped at the intersection...and they all start approaching..they all hit each other and the pedestrian keeps running..all cause there was a blackout??!! people really are that stupid!

Friday night went out for J's stagette in toronto with the all the girls..there was 13 of us i think..we went to THE SHWA!! LOL oshawa!! to the big sexy!! to watch the chipendales..IT was fun..we had a good time..J had a really good time!! we got to her house at the end of the night and she had her keys in the house..we ended up chilling at Dors' house until Curtis came to get us...after that i was throwing up..i didn't have much to drink cause i had to drive home so i wasn't sure what it was...WELLL>......turns out i had one nasty flu...the worst flu i have had in years cause i get the flu shot..guess it didn't work to well this time.  All weekend i was in bed..feverish...shivering..aching..sore throat..vomiting..dying....  I must say Shane took very good care of me..he tended to my every need and looked after me..

Monday i went to take my mom to the doctor...i hate her doctor which is why i originally transferred my file out (even though he delivered me and was my doctor for like 20 something years)...but he had told my mom (when she paid the annual fee he charges..that i am included if i wanted to come back) so i figured..i still have a fever..i can't swallow even fluids..let me get it checked out.  HE REFUSED TO SEE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can you believe that?! he said its not fair to my other doctor..geez..so while my mom was getting tests in the lab i went to the receptionist to ask if any dr can see me (it is a walk-in clinic) she said the only one doing the walk-ins today was that same dr..my moms dr that refused me..so i said yeah i will see him (i am desperate).  While i was in the room he did a double take as he walked by the door...but he had to see me he could not refuse care to a patient!!! LOL it was funny...now on antibiotics (for tonsilitis)..geez...but i must say..i feel much much better!!!

Now on to more wedding stuff!! I have to cut down on the OT..i think i overdid myself! lol

I must say however that i am afraid they are trying to end the OC!  I really hope there is a season four!  I must say that i look forward to my thursdays!  I will be truly hurt if they don't continue another season..i can't wait to see how they do that with them at different colleges..

I can't wait to buy season three!!  as soon as this season is over i am going to start watching from season one to prepare for when season three is on dvd!

"event","This past couple of weeks have been mad crazy busy which is why i haven't updated my journal at all. First of all we went to Cancun, Mexico for my friend Janoa's stagette. To sum things up we had a great time!! There wasn't any arguments or fights (that tend to happen when you put seven girls together), we were able to relax and have a good time. The weather was absolutely beautiful, the hotel was gorgeous and the staff there were super nice. I would highly recommend anyone stay at the Grand Caribe Real. One of two bad things was the allergic reaction that i had where my face swelled, i started panicking and then thought my throat was swelling..thank god for benedryl..took a lot of that down there...it was very nice of Janoa, Christine and Dor to stay with me that night and look after me...i really appreciated that..felt bad that they didn't go out but they insisted they wanted to stay..i really appreciated it. Other bad thing was all the fighting i did with Shane over this trip. To make a long story short..i don't really like the way he acted about me going..i don't think he handled it well at all...and i hope he doesn't act like that again..but we resolved things and all is good again. Now on to finish planning Janoa's wedding and on to more planning of mine as well...&nbsp;<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://us.f13.yahoofs.com/bc/43f3d749mc834907b/bc/My+Documents/can2.jpg?BC5vpQEBF4dvKe7d"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://us.f13.yahoofs.com/bc/43f3d749mc834907b/bc/My+Documents/can1.jpg?BC5vpQEBpL2p.0eN"" /><br /><br /><br />This past weekend was a very nice one...i went to Shanes for good friday (after church of course) and we had a nice pizza dinner and watched The history of violence.&nbsp; It was a pretty good movie..we both liked it.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday we saw Ryan off before his trip..visited with Josh and Sharon and then we went downtown shopping.&nbsp; It happened to be a beautiful day and it was nice just walking through the streets of downtown..it was nice to see all the people out and about doing their thing..Toronto looked so beautiful.&nbsp; We had a nice lunch/dinner and then headed back to sauga.&nbsp; We had some ice cream treats (anyone that knows me knows that i only eat mint choc chip...so yummy!!) and then we rented some movies...We saw just friends..very cute little movie..my kind of movie..Ryan Reynolds is hot!! oh my! lol We attempted to watch another movie but fell asleep...It was a&nbsp; nice weekend..just what we needed!&nbsp; Now i am back to work...working tonight but regretting i took the shift...the time and a half better be worth it!!<br /><br />ok that is all!!"

So friday night we went to register at the bay for shower gifts..it was fun but damn expensive...so we still have to finish..but we got a start. 

Saturday i did some errands and then we went for dinner where we were served by a crackhead.....literally...At first i thought the guy was either drunk or ""special""...we debated over it until he screwed up our order..he forgot our order..etc..finally another waitress came to tell us that our waiter was sick and got sent home.  That peaked our curiosity where shane decided to ask the waitress if the waiter was on drugs...long story short she confided in us that he has a past drug problem and that they thought he was using again..we ended up getting half off our bill!!!  After that we went to dave and busters where we played some games and had some drinks..watched a chick vomit all over in dave and busters (who does that?!)....

Sunday went shopping with the girls and then went back to Janoa's where we had food..drinks and watched d.housewives and greys..

went back to the grind for monday...finally back on night shifts..month of days is done!"

-patient went nuts and threw a oxygen saturation machine (if you don't know what that is its pretty big)through his room window and it ended up falling down a couple floors and landing outside the hospital..then the police handcuffed him.  Later on he pulled the fire alarm...

-Had a flood in the hospital that ruined a bunch of floors and the elevators..apparently water was ankle deep and was flowing everywhere..they had to relocate the units...

-Had two code blues...

-i got trained for charge nurse and got hit with a bunch of admits and room changes

-i worked three shifts in one week at scar gen...

i think there were more dramas then that but my memory is vague right now...
that is all.."

"event","so just to catch up on things....

I have had my week off...normally i pick up shifts on it..cause face it..we don't get paid for our week off.  However, I haven't been able to pick up a lot of shifts.  

The weekend past I went to Touch Nightclub.  Had fun there as usual..saw some people i hadn't seen in a while.  I worked out both days on the weekend so i was quite proud of myself.

Tuesday i had my appt with the ortho dr.  So it comes down to this, i can have surgery (at Mt Sinai) or (after they compare the xray with the MRI and see everything is ok) i can live with the pain and we continue to monitor the lesion in my knee every year.  I think i will go with the latter.  I do not really want surgery.  If i can avoid it i will.  Just have to get that comparisons of films done and then if its safe i will just keep an eye on things.  

Worked last night...for some reason i was very tired..the floor was very busy...lots of admissions and i almost got vomited on while inserting and N/G tube on someone.  I passed out completely when i got home and forced myself to get up early at one.  I went for Janoa's dress fitting.  I must say she looks absolutely beautiful in her dress!!  AFter that we went looking around for bridesmaids dresses but i still can't find one i like. Actually we found a really nice one but it is made in every colour but blue.  Who does that??  Blue is a wicked colour!  Anyways, gotta keep looking.

Now i am just relaxing..caught up with american idol from last night and i am ready for tonights show with the guys!! Just taking it easy cause i am exhausted from lack of sleep....Tomorrow i gotta hit the dentist and then the gym!  That is all for now!

Ciao"

"event","Yesterday I had a make up trial with MAC.  I liked the way they did my make up..may go with them..but i am going to get one more trial with one of my friends first.  After that, Shane and I ordered some yummy thai food and watched a movie.  It was a very nice night...we haven't had time to chill like that in a while with working lots and wedding planning...

Today I went to the Trauma Nursing conference at the delta hotel.  I must say that i really enjoyed it.  I learned a lot and the speakers were pretty good with the exception of one or two that were a tad boring.  Two things particular hit me...one was the commercials that were shown.  They are apparently commercials that are run in the UK but cannot run here because they are too graffic.  The first commercial has a young highschool couple that are at their school kissing and hanging out.  Their two friends in a car call them over and they get into the car.  They are talking and laughing in the car and the driver kinda serves into oncoming traffic and hits another car head on.  Everyone in the car except the one boy (from the couple)had belts on.  They show him in slow motion fly forward and hit the two girls..and then fly back and hit his girlfriend in the head with his head.  They then show the carnage of bodies and a paramedic comes on and says ""i heard that the guy not wearing a seat belt caused all of this"".  I swear...that sent chills down my spine.  You had to see the commercial.  Another one was a guy driving along..going maybe five or ten over the speed limit and hits a girl on a bike..they show her flying thru the air and then her contorted body on the ground.  The guy is in shock.  Doesn't know what happened but the girl is dead.  Those were just insane.  They really need to play those here so that people can see the impact that accidents really have.  I would really like some of my friends to see it so they take it seriously when i put on a belt in the back seat.  It doesn't matter where you are in the car...if you get in an accident you are at risk....

The other thing i liked was that Terry Evanshen came to speak to us.  I watched his movie a couple months ago.  He was basically in a bad car reck near Oshawa when a van ran a red and t-boned him.  In the movie they show his struggle with amnesia (not remembering his life before the accident..including his wife and kids).  It was a very riviting movie. Anyways he came to speak to us.  It was very moving to hear him speak.  Afterwards he was selling his book about his experience and signing copies.  I got a copy..so if anyone is interested in reading it (i highly recommend it) let me know..."

We still managed to have fun tho cause all the admissions came saturday around two..so before that we had fun playing countless rounds of asshole and watching 40 yr old virgin in the nursing station lol

I would like to acknowledge how mad i was at Ryan for giving me and empty cd case of Electric Youth v2.  The only thing that stopped me from being fuming mad was that he kindly left me some bloody caeser wings (giving them to shane to bring tme to work) and writing happy valentines day on it... i still want my damn cd tho..i really wanted to be at vintage but go screwed with that..having to work...

Today has been a long day..Shane has my car cause his is broken..and i wanted to do some errands and stuff but couldn't..have to catch up on everything tomorrow.  I actually was going to walk up the street to go to golden mile..but when i stepped outside it was REALLY cold like winter..i had to step back in.

Again my complaining about living in an apartment..ANOTHER notice that on thursday they are going to be having fire drills..AGAIN..why do they do this stuff when i work nights...geez...

"event","The grammies were good this year.  I liked the fact that they did a lot of performances.  I loved Kayne's performance..as usual he was great!! He is very creative!! I also liked the combo performances like linkin/jay-z/paul, ciara/maroon5 etc.  I know i am probably going to get a lot of people against this comment but i wasn't too impressed by the Mary J-U2 performance.  I love that song but i think mary outsang it a little bit.  Don't get me wrong i love her and she is a great singer/performer but i think she oversang that (geez i think i watch too much american idol..i sound like Simon!!).

Last night the OC episode was great!  I am a little sad that Johnny died..but..i like the new little spark i see with ryan and johnnys cousin..also i think it would be interesting if marissa hooked up with sandy's employee (i forget his name).  There are a lot of potential story lines there...I am sad to see Kaitlin go..i liked her..and where the hell did Taylor disappear to? I like her..i want her back..(well i know Shane really wants her back too..but for other reasons lol).  CSI was pretty good too...and ER was wicked..i like the fact that Clamente and Jody got shot (although i knew it was coming) and i like the twist that they think it was Vic (Clamente) that did it.  He is going to get screwed cause bobby works for the po po so he will get out of everything..I feel really bad for Sam when Luca told her that him and Abby were expecting a baby..i liked them together..geez..so sad...

Last night we went to Dream for Heather's bday.  It was a fun night..nice bit of old school that Scratch played..and the crowd was good cause it was older and mixed...Suffered today tho..didn't think i drank much last night but i was quite sick this morning...STILL i managed to fight with the damn drs office and go to the gym..now i gotta go relax cause i am on a weekend of night shifts..wish me luck...

But i did see the craziest thing last night. You know the job has gotten to you when you offer to put and NG tube in yourself to show a patient what it looks like.. YES ...a doctor voluntarily did this!! He was gagging the whole time and ended up spilling water on himself but he did try and put and NG tube down himself. Very nice doctor (this is very rare) and he was so good with the patient. He was so exhausted...from working their 36 hour shifts...that is the only reason we can figure he would do this lol..that was the talk of the night shift last night...</P>
<P>&nbsp;My good friend Chris tied the knot to Robyn on saturday, feb 4..just want to say congrats to them again!! (don't really have a good pic of the two of them..will post when i get it...The wedding was a beautiful and fun wedding..and it was almost like a highschool reunion...our old group of highschool friends reunited!! </P>

And..today we ordered our Bombenieres and our centerpieces!! I will keep a secret what they are!! But they are good! Next onto booking the park for photos and ordering a cake...</P>

I forgot to mention one other thing (besides the carting of grocery bags up the stairs/elevator) that i hate about apartments...the constant having to upgrade stuff..which always happens when i am on nights and have to sleep in the day..so they decided they are going to upgrade the washrooms..so i had to go sleep at my moms..which was kinda weird (like being at home all over again but not..cause my room is gone)..but thats another story..anyways..we got a brand new toilet and shower head out of it but it always sucks that they do it when i am home..why can't they for once do it when i am not here!!! ok that is all..but the toilet is nice..you don't have to do the ""ten second hold down anymore!!!""-for anyone that has been to my house!"

They are just assholes..well ortho and gen surg mainly...the neurosurgeons are nice tho...but the rest..geez..don't know what is up their asses..they are rude and they think they are gods gift-that they know everything.  They don't return your pages or do what you ask them to do.  Its damn frustrating when you have to tell the patient and family..sorry but the doctor hasn't returned my 6000 pages in 12 hours so i can't give you this medication/treatment.  I even told one of the drs that i think they need to follow a nurse around for one 12 hour shift just to see how hard our job really is and exactly what we do.  I really hope it gets better cause it makes our job so much harder. Ok enough of that.

Its my weekend to work..so gotta get that outta the way.  That is all for now..i am really in need of a vacation..this weather sucks..and i want some sun and beach..

I laid there for a few minutes looking at the sheets of ice that covered the stairs.  I was thinking that maybe i broke something cause i had such intense pain in my hip and back.  I finally got up and started walking.  I made it into work with such pain.  I did end up staying at work for the twelve hour shift..but the massive bruise on my hip was disgusting!  I cannot even begin to tell you how gross this bruise was...and very painful.  Damn landlords don't even care...

Bought it on friday..i was getting frustrating because Shane and I must have hit every future shop and best buy in toronto/vaughn/sauga and the camera i wanted was sold out.  Only do we find at out at the best buy in markham that the camera is sold out in canada..do you think anyone could have told us that before????  Well i ended up getting the upgraded model to it (Canon SD 400)...i am very happy with it..its beautiful and tiny! i love it!! anyways..gotta start taking some pics!

Ok so after shopping friday..i got sick in the night..ended up being up all night and had to call in sick at 0300am.  Can you imagine the jokes..of course it was young people on shift and they all know that i like to go out..so of course the rumours were that i was out partying..got drunk and was too sick to come to work.  Of course that was not true..i ended up with the flu...my thoughts while feeling so ill was that i must have go a placebo instead of the flu shot.  I ended up being sick for new years..still went to Ryan and Sharons house but didn't drink and was miserable cause i ached.  The next day i came home and watch bend it like beckham...great movie..i liked it!  and then i went to sleep at 830pm.  I felt better today so i went into work...i guess that flu shot does help because normally people are out for a lot longer than two days!  Oh well...guess that is what i get for getting both Christmas and New Years off..i am destined to work one of them!

Ok..so the highlight of my week before xmas was that Shane showed up to my work (yes ..i didn't know he knew where i worked either!!!) and brought me my favorite wings from all stars...it was very nice..i was so happy.

Ok..now we skip to Christmas...Xmas eve we went to church..very nice service at barnabas..i am used to Thomas moore...but it was nice nonetheless...then we went to my parents house where we looked at photos from their trip to Columbia and then openned gifts!  After that we went to Shane's house in boonie ville and openned gifts there...then i think i finally crashed...itching with hives..i ate something at work and broke out in them during the week..i was battling them all week. 

Woke up xmas morning and had a yummy breakfast..my parents came to Shanes to get me and we went to my Uncle bills house..we chilled there..nice to see everyone..my cousin was there from B.C/Hawaii and my other cousins were there so it was fun..would have been nice to stay longer but we had to jet and go to Scarlem to pick up some stuff..then we headed back to Shanes for dinner...we had a lovely spread of food and then just chilled...

Boxing day we went to Ryan and Sharons house and played games, played with the kids etc.  I got to meet Wayne and Amelias little girl...she is adorable...

The following day we went shopping at Vaughn mills..got some good deals..it was mad crazy busy...then we went seaching for a digicam for me...but to my disappointment they were sold out everywhere of the one i wanted..i am still looking for it and hopefully i will get it soon..i really want it...i have wanted one for a long time..and now that i have gotten xmas money to get one..they are all sold out of the one i want..that really sucks..i hope i can get it soon

The next day i went back to work...lots of shootings and stabbings over xmas..i just don't get people these days...and don't even get me started on the shooting at the eaton centre..that is just purely ridiculous...i can't even fathom what people are thinking...

Yesterday i saw Alycia..she came back to visit from Cali..it was really good to see her..i miss the old days when the three of us (mich, lysh and me) used to frequent croc rock!! ahhh the good ole days....

Today i took a me day...went to the gym..chilled and now i am off to a movie..that is all for now..."

"event","Yesterday at work was mad crazy busy.  For some reason our manager said it was cool for us to work short.  I guess this comes from not knowing that the unit is really busy and heavy.  The day started off shitty because it was so busy.  I guess it keeps the day going by quickly when its like that.  I like the hospital at Christmas time because it is so festive.  I think i may almost miss working Christmas!!! (believe it or not).  I know i will miss the free Swiss Chalet Christmas dinner that we get!!  Anyways, yesterday was a particulary rewarding day.  I was on my way to go to the washroom when i see this man walking down the hallway.  Low and behold is was a patient that we had a while ago.  The man looked amazing!!! When he first came in he couldn't talk..couldn't walk..was so aggressive by hitting nurses that we had to have him in four-point restraints.  For some reason he took to me and when he started walking he used to follow me around and blow kisses and give me a thumbs up.  Most of the time i could get him to do what i wanted.  So anyways, yeah he came back for a follow up appointment and besides the little squint in one of his eyes you would never have known that he had the bone flap removed from his brain and that he was so seriously ill.  That was very nice to see..we chatted for a bit and he came to say hi to everyone at the nursing station.  

Then i went on my lunch and i see this lady walking down the hallway.  She looks vaguely familiar.  She calls out to me and i walk over and she goes, ""you dont' remember me do you..i was one of your patients..."" then it all comes back to me.  She was a nurse that fell asleep driving after night shift...she was injured quite bad...she looked truly amazing...she was walking (which she wasn't doing when she left to go to rehab) and she just looked amazing!! We chatted for a bit and then she went to her appointment.  

It was so nice to see that all the hard work and putting up with patients pays off in the end.  Both of those patients were really hard to deal with and they both are back to their regular lives with little reminants of their accidents.  That really made my day to see that.  

Ok well tomorrow is the Christmukkah Barmitsvahkah!!! Can't wait for that episode..i will have my hot chocolate and popcorn ready!!

I still have a lot of Chirstmas Shopping to do..i was planning on doing it this week but if we get that horrible snowstorm that we are supposed to..it might get put off...we'll see...

That is all for now!"

"event","i went looking for apartments yesterday. The girl living in it already was just..alright. The apartment was nice..really close to Sunset Blvd in Hollywood. 20 min from everything..the only problem is that I think she smells bad. I don't want her to stink up all my things..is this a reasonable arguement? Well..regardless I'd only be paying like $450 including utitlities. That's a pretty sweet deal for a temporary arrangement."

"event","<p>i think today was a really good day. smoking with laine was really chill. i think he's an awesome guy. i think he brings alot of positive energy. we were just sitting in my car, no one around..right on campus--windows down..breeze..and sigurros. almost like the perfect moment. we smoked like 2 bowls..the bud was blueberry, i got it from my friend whose part of the cannibus club. she's awesome, but that's another story. the sun was kind of getting ready to set so..it was really chill. the parking lot i was parked in faces a typical california suburan neighborhood, being trashed from behind. the house was this really loud yellow..the grass almost looked like the turf from the brady bunch backyard. there was vertical american flag hanging from the roof..it flapped in the wind liked..it wanted &nbsp;to just..fly away. laine and i both noticed it was like the ""american dream"". but literally even because right next door there was some shitty rundown apartment complex. the 80's style motel ones with the dated chipping paint. and some old guy is always snooping in their lawn..i've seen him sometimes when i'm in my car..lol. oh well. welcome to WHITTIER. anyways..smoking with laine made my day. i think after he was going for a run. i told him running while high is awesome..</p>"

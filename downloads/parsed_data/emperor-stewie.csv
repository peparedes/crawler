It happens too much in my life, but I never feel afraid of the future, I just can't worry about it. I have no clue where my life is leading, for all I know I could be broken tomorrow, and yet that doesn't worry me.

LJ: It just happened a long time ago

Xanga: School friends

Myspace: To make fun of Hilary Duff to Jared.

I'm pretty sure no one really reads this or cares that I'm even here, but I've been venturing back every once and a while and I finally found time to do this. Anyway, I guess a recap for my life is in order... but where to begin. I have been single for a year offically this month, despite several small possibilities that were better vanquished, and it actually has kind of done me some good. I think I thought I knew more than I did and I've had a lot of time to live and learn. Not saying I would welcome a relationship, I'm just not pushing for one. I am almost done with my Sophmore year and I'm applying for a job at cost plus, all I'm doing is waiting for my last refrence to e-mail me back, or else I got to find someone else.

I haven't gotten enough sleep in the past year... I have to blame that on the fact that I have started acting. It's been fun, but tiring and once a job starts I know it will be worse, but I do plan to go on vacation a couple of times. The job may be a bust, but it would be worth it to Road Trip to L.A. in order to see Ben Folds. That's kind of everything in a nutsehll, nothing really new... anyone want to hang out this summer?"

"event","Okay, so two down and two to go, but you get the picture. We had our opening night on Friday and it was amazing, everything went really well, the crowd loved it, and we all had the amazing energy it required. Some people probably got too cocky though, as a turn for the worse soon came.

Second night started fine, everyone was there early, everyone was ready, we did the hokey pokey and did what we could to prepare. Only problem is that some people thought that they were going to do it perfectly, and so our energy level was way down and there was like no motivation. And then came scene three! Sean's mic wasn't on when he came out, one of the girls knocked over a plant on her way running by, and a couple of props were just off stage out of reach. Despite it all we got through fine enough, people still gave us a lot of compliments and seemed to like it at the end. Back stage was horrible though, people were being unruly, people were going in and out of the back door when they shouldn't have, and people were being loud... so much trouble... but I still made it out alive. Monday is going to hurt though.

I'm in charge of props and because of that, despite the fact that there aren't a lot of props in this play, I am always the last one to leave. While everyone else runs out: on dates, to make out in the parking lot, or to go sleep, I am stuck at school putting everything away. I will be able to update this more, slowly, but I can make time. Also, I may make a friends only journal, but that won't be till the play is over, and I hopefully get a job.

I really do not like people who have to be funny in order to be accepted, in order to be loved. They search for the cheap, easy jokes in situations for people to laugh and hang around them a bit longer. I would prefer if these guys took a hint, that every moment we do not need a remark from you, that sometimes it's okay to be silent. This isn't about anyone here and it's not coming out right. I will rant on this later, but for now I will take a lighter note.

I think I have the ultimate tool, a weapon we can use to right the wrongs on not only our own planet, but our galaxy. Evil will tremble, heros will rise, and sandwichs will taste their ultimate best because... just cause. But it's not something all can carry, only the select few can hold it with pride and use it for it's destined use. Are you one of them? Can the lightsaber be held in your hand? 

Yes, I bought a really cheap plastic lightsaber at toys 'r' us, but it's awesome because we just beat the crap out of each other with them."

""The high school section of Hanging Loose began in 1968. It is intended to present the very best work being produced by the country's most accomplished teenage writers. It's not the right place to send poems and stories if you've just begun writing or if you've only submitted work because a teacher said you had to. HL does not print poems which read like greeting card rhymes or pop lyrics. Other common troubles include hastily written work with glaring errors; obvious imitations of well-known poems; vague generalizations about Love and Life; poems stuffed with cliches and tired language; and poems that are so private the reader cannot decipher them.""

A cop followed me home last night, and I know he followed me because I wasn't just driving down a straight road, stopped somewhere and he passed me, but here's how it went. I took a left into my neighberhood and so did this guy behind me who had just turned into my lane, the thing is that no one ever turns into my street. I go down my road cause I need to turn around, he's still behind me so I figure ""I'll just go a bit more before I do a u-turn."" I take a left. So does he. I go down to a koldisac(or however you spell it), turn onto it, and find my night friend is still behind me. I go all the way down, turn around... and so do they. I stop my friend Zach's car to tell him where my house is and the (what we are convinced is a)cop whistles this weird ""get moving signal"" so I go forward, and begin heading back to the street of my house... and they do the same thing. I park my car and they drive by, from what I caught of the license plate I knew it was probably undercover cop. But we checked our cars from time to time to make sure our stereos were still there.

I am not a person of stage fright, in fact I never have been, but I've never had to sing in front of an entire audience before. I don't know what it is really, I mean I know I'm not the greatest singer but that doesn't stop me from randomly singing when I'm in crowds or whenever I really feel like it. I really shouldn't think, I should just do... in my own way. Well, if things were my way then this whole musical would be quite different, and at least involve a 20 minute battle scene that would not fit in anywhere. Why you ask?

<P>Bijan Amini was nearly fired near the beginning of production, being caught on camera assaulting William Bishop. Asked later, Bijan blamed the outburst on the overdose of skittles.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>""Hey, Bill here.&nbsp; Once again, HUGE thanks to Dom for all the writing and work on the final edit, and 100% of the photography for this episode. He never ceases to amaze me. The 'Overdose of skittles' thing was partially true, and can be explained basically as: Dom had this skittles jar that had 'Never been emptied' and so, we vowed to, that night, completely rid that jar of it's candy-coated....candies. We did it, but Bijan got sick from all the skittles we forced him and everyone else at the party to eat. This is definately the best writing in any of the three Hamper Man episodes thus far, and all of you should give Dom a big round of applause. Then go tell all your friends of Hamper Man. Miles is our new director, and will be introduced in a later episode. Oh, and for all you fanatics, Hamper Man will soon have a domain name. Don't listen to Dom, and his, 'Bill, you've been saying that for months!' Well, that about wraps it up for me, so tune in next time for: 'Hamper Man: Origins'."" ---Bill</P>
<P>""Woo-boy has this been a crazy adventure, and the stories! SO many to tell... but my lawyers just informed me that's in the best interest of everyone if I don't. I would like to introduce everyone to Bijan, a good friend of mine and the newest addition to our quickly growing team. As for this skittle jar, so soon as it was emptied&nbsp;I called upon the mighty powers of the skittles genie and a the jar was full again, true we had to sacrifice one member of the party to get the new skittles, but try and tell me it wasn't worth it. I don't really have much to say... except yeah Bill, you have been saying it for months, where is it already?!""&nbsp; ---Dom</P>

I guess I have my reasons for not updating, and they mostly revolve around play practice. I get home so late that I just don't find the time to do jack before I fall into a deep sleep. Not deep enough though, as I've missed running many many times for the past like two weeks and it's not good, I'm starting to see a bit more of poundage on me and it's not good. I guess I just gatta deal with it and get off my ass... Ironic as i wear a fat suit in the play. I really should be thankful though, I've been given a lot of time to think and I've cleared a lot of things up, except almost killing Sean, sorry bud, it wasn't me or anything personally. So I will not dance away, until I got some good stories to tell, and trust me, they're coming.

Oh yes, and Hilary Dyff does not diserve a movie about MUSIC.


Random play part we made fun of:

Teddy: I beg your pardon! Who are you?
Johnathen(who looks like Borris Karloff): I'm Woodrow Wilson, now go to bed!
Teddy (real line): No, you're not Wilson, but your face IS familiar.
Teddy (line I did): My god Wilson what happened to you?!"

Empty Hopes Too Late:

Darkened skies of lonely hearts,
burn brightly to a dulled light.
Put out like a cigarette,
withered away to a garden's past,
forgiveness never given to its worth.
Tick away till the power dies,
sleep to insomnia's bitter end.
Drink from an empty glass,
fill it all to nothingness.
Save me from the water's edge,
but you let me slip away.
Sliding through hoplessness,
choking on the words I try to say.
One last look is all I ask,
one last look is all it takes..."

I read for the part of Teddy, a crazy guy who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt, and people told me I had done really well. Today I went back for the second audition, for every part with Teddy I was called up to read so I had an idea that it was mine. After my first little read through today, the director handed me a packet on Roosevelt's life and told me to read through it. She didn't quite tell me I had the part, but it was obvious. Then she announced the parts, I got Teddy and everyone else was cast perfectly. I have refearsel every day of every week until the play from 3-5:15. But I gatta be best I can, right?"

After reading the long works of himself he put them in a sling shot and shot them to Earth. Sadly, he did not know much about gravity, space, or physics so he pretty much wiped out all of the life in one firey piece of literature. He then returned back home to find something else... NEW LIFE CAME FORTH! And he suffered two heart attacks, fell down, and hit his head on some passing by rock that is forever caught in the Earth's orbit. When he came to he found a complete civilization with giant metal towers and something he curiously dubbed as ""Loud-mouthed New Yorker""s.

Oh, and I hate my country report, and the fact that I procrastinate. If anyone has a very detailed report on China I can take, crop out some stuff, mess around with and put my name on please drop me a line."

"event","I really missed Sara today. She told me not to call her from Samurai and I was really sad so I was missing her all day. I wanted to call her, but she told me not to and I respect her to the highest degree. She didn't want me to call so I didn't, but I felt really sad.

Otherwise today was good, I got to help judge the tournament which started late, but it was ok. I picked up Brandon's book, Paper Sailboat, picked up some comics, and other things I can't post because of a certain someone who reads this. When I checked the preview box for next week I saw NYX, was told to look just at the last page and I was like ""Holy Shit! This is awesome!"" Hear that Matt, when NYX 3 comes out next week just look at the last page and tell me if iy doesn't look cool. Out of hunger we went to Taco Bell to get munchables in a Taco Bell full of christians. It turns out it was Aquire the Fire weekend, and I know my youth group was there. After picking up Challupas we sat in traffic for 30 minutes on one street... inching towards Seventh while talking about old Power Rangers, VR Troopers, Digimon, and Beetle Borgs. Shane had to go to the bathroom pretty bad and seemed ready to kill the next person in his way. I was in the seat right next to him. I was spared and we finally got to Samurai where Shane got to the bathroom and we started club. Then we did club, got that out of the way, and put in some Family Guy. We watch the ""banned"" episode to see what it was all about. Let's just say you know you're in a group of nerds when everyone laughs really hard at an Optomis Prime is Jewish joke. I came, I saw, I conquered. Then we played besm where Bijan finally got a good ship as compared to the one that feel apart in the middle of space. The quest wasn't much, but it was fun to hear Bijan complain about not being able to move and being completly paralyzed from his own ship. We finally got things through, but had to end at a sort of half way point in the game where we were apparantly attacked by aliens. Then there was the racist jokes. How hard we laughed, and there is nothing better than a car full of people telling racist jokes, not meaning to be racist, but just to be funny. Here's my favorite, if you are offended than don't read:






This guy is driving down the road talking on his cellphone, not really paying attention, and all of a sudden he looks up to see two black guys walking across the road. It's too late, he hits his breaks, buts hits them both and sends one of them through the windsheild and into the back seat and the other flies over a fence. Both are dead and the guy is panicing so he calls the cops. ""I don't know what happened,"" he said, ""I was driving and these two were just in front of me, I couldn't stop in time."" The cop said, ""it's ok. I'll just get that guy for breaking and entering and the other fucker for running from an accident."""

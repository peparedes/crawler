got this from julia.  very fun...i have very weird taste, so odds are no one will know any.

1. You're the only one who holds my hair back when I'm drunk and gets sick. You're the only one who knows exactly what I need.
2. I'm a bad girl.  I'm a dirty girl.  I pray my soul to keep...my spirit as well, and I cannot sleep.
3. I've been lying to keep you from this pain.  Now you're crying, and I'm the one to blame.
4. Chill out, watcha yelling for?  Lay back, it's all been done before.
5. Red, the blood of angry men.  Black, the dark of ages past.
6. We've all got troubles, we all make mistakes.  But let's not take a little river and turn it into a lake.
7. Every street light seems to beat a fatalistic warning. Someone mutters and the streetlamp gutters, and soon it will be morning.
8. What took you so long?  I'll suck you all night.
9. The wolf and the lion have asked me to play. Though she told me not to, I went anyway.
10. I'm tired of rumors starting.  I'm sick of being followed.  I'm tired of people lying, saying what they want about me.
11. Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?  I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on.
12. Seven days and seven nights of thunder.  The water's rising, and I'm slipping under.
13. Dolefully desired, destiny of a lie.  Set me free, your heaven's a lie.
14. Can you look me in the eye, and tell me that your happy now?
15. Fuck all those nights I moaned real loud.  Fuck it, I faked it, aren't you proud?  Fuck all those nights you thought you broke my back. Well guess what, yo, your sex was whack.  (the best and most beautiful lyrics ever!)
16. What's up? Tell me what to do and how to be.  Teach me all your words from A to Z, but I don't want your other girl to see that you're messing 'round with me.
17. Boy, you swallow truth like honey.
18. All the things she said, all the things she said, running through my head, running through my head, running through my head.
19. Tonight her friends are coming 'round.  She says they're coming to hide me.  Tell me what they think I need.  Oh, you'll know where to find me.
20. Sailor Moon, Rainbow Brite, Anime, Avril Lite, Pro tour all the way, hey, hey, hey, hey!
21. Hearts are worn in these dark ages. You're not alone in this story's pages. The light has fallen amongst the living and the dying.
22. Wanna feel peace like Mahatma Ghandi.  Wanna drink champagne and be cool like Blondie.
23. Well, she walks real steady in her high heel steppers.  She got lots of style, she gots lots of class.
24. The moral of the story is I got no choice.  I must not chase the boys.
25. I said I tried to call the nurse again, but she's being a little bitch."

"event","yesterday was kind of crappy, but no point in complaining about it.  im sure anyone reading this is tired of me complaining anyway.  :)  one very fun part of yesterday:
""i think mrs cebula knows me a little better than you, julia""

lol, i was funny?  doesnt happen often, i know.  :)  tehe, physics is the most kick-ass class eva, yo!  our triangle (or a square if we include eric), and michelle and sarah behind me - always fun.

as for today:
sat IIs.  i was one of about 4 caucasians in my testing room.  lots of asians, many middle eastern peoples, some hispanics...kinda cool.  im a minority!  give me rights!  anyway, writing - my essay was crap, but i think i did well on it.  bio - wtf?!  we have learned nothing at spx.  i looked thru my old bio notes.  this shit was not ever mentioned.  i knew some stuff...lets hope im a good guesser.  math - i think i did well, but im pissed off b/c i finally figured out the answer to a hard question (one of three left for me) when the moderator called time up, so i scribbled down the answer quickly...in the wrong bubble!!!!  blast!  hopefully, ill still get an 800...its possible if i getted everything else right.  if you get 5 wrong, or omit 7, and still get an 800...itd be nice, but not gonna happen.

ever notice that when youre taking standardized tests, your head is like a dj...with really bad taste.  like, all of a sudden, ""heart of glass"" pops into my brain.  then, its replaced by avril lavigne, followed by keane, and lindsay lohan.  a few good ones there, but still...going from keane to lindsay lohan is not pleasant.  lol, im psychotic.  well thats it for today.  lata, dawgs!"

"event","OMFG, the strangest thing just happened to me, and it's really got me upset.  i went upstairs and into my room, when i noticed the phone was ringing.  i went into my moms room (where my mom and dad are, since my brother and his friends are here) and asked who it was, since the caller id said blocked call, and she said it was for me.  ill try and say every detail of everything that happened next, since i cant quite remember what exactly happened.

i took the phone and said, ""hello?""  no response, so i began to say it again when someone else said, ""hello?""  didnt recognize the voice, but thought it was a girl.  she said, ""alex?"" and i said, ""yeah.""  then she started talking really fast and i didnt quite understand her.  what i think i caught was ""youre a fucking asshole"" and ""you wont amount to anything""...i think that was said.  then, she said something - which i cannot completely remember - ...maybe like, just wanted to let you know, or something like that.  and then ""goodbye"" and hung up.

i was just in shock and it wasnt really long, so i didnt get to say anything to her (i do think its her).  i remember when i hung up, my first thought was that it was allison smith, but i honestly dont know.  i just think it might be her, since she seems the type to do that, and we had some small argument last week after school.  i have no idea...but, this has really got me upset.  i know it doesnt really mean anything (or at least i hope it doesnt), but still...who would hate me so much?  my mom though the voice sounded disguised, but it sounded like a girl.  the voice sounded kind of high and whiny, maybe?  my memory during things like this is pretty bad, so i dont know.  im trying to think of people who dont like me...allison (as mentioned), steph (i cant imagine her doing this), that mean freshmen on stage crew (i doubt she knows my name)...please, say something to me, since im...*sigh* this is really upsetting me."

Tehe.  This also rocks.  How come I always get all the sexual stuff? ...Oh right.  Yeah, so, I'm back to not unhappy (I know, that was fast), but comforting would still be nice."

"event","Yay, so I'm starting my own LiveJournal, due to the influence that Julia has over me.  :) Haha, yay.  So, school starts tomorrow...that sucks.  It also sucks that I can't really look forward to next summer, because high school will be over, and I won't see my friends everyday anymore.  And, I'm also sad because I know I probably won't see alot of people from Pius ever again, even though I enjoy spending time with them.  I need to make sure to get everyone's email and AIM/AOL sn before the end of this year.

...Yeah, so Drama starts up soon.  *unenthustiastically* Yay...The worst thing is the little meeting before auditions, and the auditions themselves.  It's just so unfun, being in the music room/hall outside of music room with all those people, practicing lines, for no real reason.  I certainly hope I get a role in this fall play, though.  I have done every fall play, though I've never had a good role.  ...Y'know, even though I do get parts in most plays, if you think about it, it's kinda by default...and they suck.  There have only ever been two roles I was happy to get (well, three, but I wasn't originally cast in the third).  I loved the murder mysteries, and everything about them.  My roles were really fun!  I also liked being Jacob in Joseph, but that's only because it was a role, which I did get by default, by the way.

Hey, look at me rant!  I'm good at this.  But, no, I mean, I was kind of happy with Captain Bones in Treasure Island, but I died really early.  And that fall hurt like hell!  But, Tubal in Merchant...OMG, that sucked.  C'mon, it seriously did.  Little Bryan had a far larger role than me!  Matt Rowe had a larger role than me! And I was a junior.  And now that there are more males in Drama in our class, I'm no longer guaranteed a role.  Damn you, Erik Breidenbach and Nick Birtch!  Neither of you better do this show!  Before you, it was just me and Andrew.  Well, in Fools, it was just me! :)

And, yes, I'm still sour about not being an officer in Drama.  Damn Drama people, I don't really like most of them.  They blindly follow the people they think are cool, and they don't even have minds of their own.  Not my friends, of course, but you know how Drama is.  There's all these little mini-cliques, and I'm not in the cool mini-clique.  How freakin' sad is it that there's a cool mini-clique in Drama?  Extremely!  Well, they're not cool, but they do seem to run things among the kids.  And they think they're better than other people.  I won't mention names, but everyone should know who I'm referring to.  And, I'd love to present flowers to someone at some point!  Anyone!  I've been a prominent member of Drama since freshmen year.  I'm a fun, nice person who's had a hell of alot of (crappy) roles.  I think I deserve to do it at least once.  If Andrew is assistant director for this year's Murder Mystery, I don't care what the hell anyone says, I'm giving him the goddamn flowers!

Yeah, so, I'm done ranting.  Let me summarize in case you didn't read all that.  School sucks.  Drama sucks.  Yay, so...yay!"

Alright so I created this live journal account so I could post projects from my experience here at brooks institute. I may post daily events , but generally this will be a forum for assignment products. Our first assignment is&nbsp; ""A day in the life of Santa Barbara"" When I am done deciding which pictures I will turn in, I will post them here. Our next assignment is ""Line, Shape, Texture."" Honestly this sounds like it will be fun. SO... If you wanna know more personal details about my time here in Santa Barbara... contact me via my-space or face-book.


Peace Out

WTF Doc, why did you wait until the last week of practice to start teaching us 2 songs? Incredibly awesome.

My dad is taking me to dinner tomorrow. I hope I don't cry or something because I'm PMSy and going home and sleeping for a while sounds awesome.

I feel like a bitch. Katie, I'm sorry love, you always get the brunt.

Oh and Shane isn't coming this weekend. Perfect.

I really love my intelligence in taking on the courseload I did for this semester.

I just have really salty language swimming in my brain right now...that's my destresser.

Why do I have to take Psychology? Just another thing to add to my plate.

I like Switchfoot, but I'm starting to get bored with the new cd since that's what we're listening to most of the time.

Not even Alpha Gam is cheering me up right now, because I have such deep capacity to be a bitch.

I don't like myself right now. I need to do more work.

I'm still angry with that certain person who was even more of a bitch than I feel right now. It was not her right to shoot her mouth off about something like that. 

How high school can you get?"

Erhem. Excuse me. Anyway, Cori is on her way to have an Econ study session.


On more important news, I just heard that they are making a new Pride and Prejudice movie and they are allowing Kiera Knightley to play ELIZABETH BENNETT. UGH, PUKE, GAG, BARF. no. This is sacriledge and I am protesting. She is NOT WORTHY.

Besides, how could they possibly improve on the A&E miniseries with the delicious Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy? It's like right out of the book.

I've already decided. They are going to butcher it and Kiera Knightley should be stricken down with a divine bolt from God as a sign that the Anti Christ is on his way.

"event","So this weekend was great and productive. Carmina Burana was INSANE. It sounded so delectable, and Doc and Vicki and the swan guy rocked the solos. I am not sorry not to sit onstage for the duration of the piece though...long-ass piece of music. And it was hot with 150 people and the orchestra onstage under the lights. After the concert on Saturday night, Cori and I had some roomie bonding time. We came back to my room, hung out in our sweats and watched First Wive's Club...talked til about 1 in the morning. Next year is going to be just swell. 

After the concert on Sunday, Shane surprised me (he came!!!) and so he got to meet a bunch of my friends...I met Ryan and Cori's mom and brother, and they met him. It was great. Only a bit over a week and then I won't have to say goodbye to him except for periods of less than 24 hours. I am super stoked. 

I got all the classes I wanted for next semester...now if I can manage to live through finals. Gala is coming up so quickly, I can't wait!

SaySay's 16th b-day is this Thursday...I can't believe I turned 16 when I was in New Zealand. It seems like a lifetime ago.

Mom and Ken are coming this weekend to move me out for the most part. Woot. I might miss this old room...but maybe not :)

This is a beautiful poem that I have been thinking about all weekend...

Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No.
It is immortal as immaculate Truth,
'Tis not a blossom shed as soon as youth,
Drops from the stem of life--for it will grow,
In barren regions, where no waters flow,
Nor rays of promise cheats the pensive gloom.
A darkling fire, faint hovering o'er a tomb,
That but itself and darkness nought doth show,
It is my love's being yet it cannot die,
Nor will it change, though all be changed beside;
Though fairest beauty be no longer fair,
Though vows be false, and faith itself deny,
Though sharp enjoyment be a suicide,
And hope a spectre in a ruin bare.                          --Hartley Coleridge, Sonnet VII

I saw Closer, and didn't really enjoy it. There are other movies in the sea I suppose...I need sleep!"

"event","Ok, so I admit that I managed to live through this week...but there are still 2 more to survive after this. However, I feel I am not remiss in indulging in the rest of the day to kick back and relax. 

I have a heck of a lot to do and get under control this weekend, and I have to do it all juggled around Carmina Burana performances. Oh well, it'll get done, all of it. At least my coughing is much relieved and improved...seeing as how I have to sing tomorrow.

Shane is seriously talking about transfering to Central next year. I don't know how I feel about it. It feels selfish to let him give up going to such a respected school just so we can see each other more often. He said his mom told him that she told his dad she'd be surprised if he didn't transfer next year. Hmmm.

My family and friends are at ATF this weekend...and I'm here. Poop.

I do have some excellent movie choices though, and I think tonight I'll just chill by myself and mellow out. Yesterday was too hectic to carry over into today. I'll start on everything tomorrow. 

Amazing thing: I heard for the first time someone playing a Zeppelin OTHER than Stairway to Heaven in my hallway today. I was shocked, quite pleasantly, because I had begun to be convinced that no one knew they wrote other songs. And the song of choice...Since I Been Lovin You. I about collapsed in the middle of the hallway in euphoria. We're taking baby steps here in Alma. 

Must start thinking about packing to get most of my stuff out of here the weekend before exams. But not right now. I want to just lie in the receding sunspot of my bed and drift off...I'd really like to be kissing a certain someone right now though. Sigh. My sunspot will have to do."

"event","I contracted (randomly)bronchitis over the weekend, which is BAD since I'm an asthmatic. Poor Shane came up to take care of me and he did a really good job. But by Sunday morning, I had a fever of 102.2 and I was not feeling so hot. Let's not go through the painful details of the stunning doctor visit and trying to get hold of my insurance info while my parents are at church. Let's suffice it to say that I was miserable and that I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in going on 2 weeks. 

So Shane, bless his heart, takes me home because my mom is really scared because she knows how bad I get when I have bronchitis and also because I'm just plain miserable and almost unable to take care of myself. We went on Sunday, and both Sarah and Liz are ill with different things. My mother pampered me and it felt so good to be taken care of and loved. We got to talk a long time and it just made me feel lighter of spirit. Anyway, my mom kicks ass because Sarah ended up throwing up 3 times Sunday night and my mom ends up sleeping on Sarah's floor to take of her when she is vomiting, and then also getting up to take care of me when I woke up every hour having coughing attacks and unable to breathe. I guess Liz threw up 6 times on Wednesday night, too...so my mom is just amazing and so loving. I miss her again, she is my best friend.

But I just got back...Tuesday night and I still feel sucky though I think the fever reduced completely yesterday. Sarah stayed home from school both days with me, so we hung out on opposite sides of the room so we wouldn't contract the other's illness. I am coughing up all sorts of yucky things, but the doc gave me a cough depressant (dangerous with an asthmatic) so I could actually get some sleep. I am really stoked though because I got the job at Pitter Patter! I start as soon as I come home and I get to work in the BABY ROOM. I am so excited. I need another part-time for the mornings, but at least this part is fixed! And I know I will like one of my jobs!!! I love kids.

One slight problem...all this coughing has wrecked my throat and I sound like a pubescent frog. Carmina is this weekend and we have tons of rehearsals. I can't sing, I have no voice!

Anyway, that's my sucky story for now. I miss my boyfriend and my sisters and my mom. Blech."

"event","I had to miss Bible Study again last night because Shane and I were in the middle of a huge blow-up. Of course we are fine, but I just have to laugh.

Poor Cori, she seemed so concerned when I told her that we had a fight. I guess she and Ryan don't fight ever. Whereas I get worried if Shane and I don't have a decent scrap biweekly. Ok, when we actually see each other everyday (or close to it) its more like bimonthly. I love that boy. 

There is nothing so satisfying as a good fight, let me tell you all. But people get so concerned. Shane and I fight over stupid things constantly, but its just how we operate. We laughed through 'The Notebook' because there were so many similarities between our relationship and their's (other than a lot of it, haha). Until we cried at the end that is.

Oh, I just thought of another couple...the parents on 'The Parent Trap.' That's a good one. This is to serve no purpose other than a sort of tribute to my wonderful boyfriend. He tries to keep his temper. But I am pretty damn good at riling him up when I'm spoiling for a fight. What can I say? It's a talent.

I want to see 'Closer'. It looks weird and good. I also want to be skinny and cut my hair. We'll see which wish is fulfilled first."

I know he's the head of the English department and all, and I'm an English major, but he treats me like his protegee in every sense of the word. The only way I am going to London with him for Spring Term next year is if Katie goes with me so I don't get assaulted, lol. But I'm only half kidding...

So Cori and I got a corner room, 2nd floor the Newb! Just what we wanted! Oh joy, oh rapture! We are so stoked, 215 Newberry, YOU ARE MINE!

I'm still excited for Carmina. I just want to sing it all the time, but with altos and ESP men voices. It sounds so hot.

I hope Shane comes up this weekend. I miss him. Cori's boyfriend Ryan is apparently a super nice guy with a bunch in common with Juanito. We were talking about how we hope they get along so we can all hang out and be nauseatingly cute together. I would just adore that.

That's pretty much all for right now...only one more French class to teach and I AM FINISHED! Being a T.A. is awesome and all, but it is a heck of a lot of work. But I'm almost finished. Je serai fini!!! Woot!

Do yourselves a favor and listen to Zeppelin, 'The Lemon Song'. It has my alltime favorite bass line, although the words are EXTREMELY DIRTY. No, he isn't asking her to make lemonade, ok? That's all I will say. But the bass line makes me feel so sassy when I listen to it...I feel everyone should experience the beauty of cette chanson."

I just watched 'Stage Beauty' which I have wanted to see for such a long time. It was really good, though slightly artsy...but that's my style. Um, Rupert Everett played an AMAZING Charles II. I love him.

"event","Yeah, ok, so it was REALLY nice to be home...so much so that I would rather forego the last 3 weeks and final exams and just have stayed. Of course there exist the obvious cons, and its not that Alma isn't just stupendous...it's just I'm ready to go home. I know I'm silly and clingy and that I overreact to inconsequential things, but I can't help it most of the time and I have the capacity to pretty much drive myself insane within the bounds of my stupidity. 

I miss how things used to be...Easter was always my favorite day of the year, and I cherish the memories of how it was. It can't be like that for me anymore. Don't you ever miss just being a kid, with nothing weighing on your mind? I do sometimes. Ignorance is bliss and all of that. It was a nice weekend and this is clearly the homestretch, but I cannot quelch my disappointment. I am back here again. It is comfortable, yet mildly dissatisfying.

I did my attempt at a selfless deed for the day. It wasn't on scale with Jesus's, but I don't think He holds that against me. I am just sad that I didn't get to stay home longer for the day. But poor Shane has to haul me all over, and I didn't want to make him lose his chance to see his family. Anyway, what was done is done, and now I move forward to past finals...ever closer to the temporary end. 

There is something relaxing and rather irritating about the cycles of life. You know most of what is coming but you are surprised anyway. And when you long for one to end and the other to begin, it only takes a bit of time before you wish for the other's swift return. C'est la vie.

Shane and I met my mom and Ken at Panera Bread on the way home on Friday. Weird, but nice. Nothing compares to a mother's hugs. The Kneisels came for dinner and my mom made Oyster Pie...delicious. We went to the community Good Friday service...highlights were the 30 minute long Catholic liturgy, my church's old organist (prior to the incredible Dah-veede) conducting the choir HORRIBLY, church ladies in full ceremonial regalia, and a preacher who bore a frightening resemblence to Uncle Rico. I kid you not.

Saturday, we got up early and went shopping. It was fun, Sarah drove to Howell. Shane and I went out to lunch since everyone else scattered at that point and went shopping (he brought normal brown shoes, no more tennis shoes!), and we all hung out and watched a bunch of Newlyweds episodes during which my mother laughed hysterically. We had an excellent dinner (artichokes, yum!) and went to Mickey's afterwards. Sarah thought she hit a raccoon and was traumatized, but she didn't actually. We had a party dying eggs and then Sarah and I painted our toes. It was fun.

This morning, got up at 5 to go to the Sonrise service and had the breakfast and stayed for the 8:15. Saw Kenzie and her boyfriend, but Ken Fader put together this INCREDIBLE video of the old Sonrise skits...hilarious! Those were good times. Went home and changed and attacked our Easter baskets AND searched for eggs Mom and Ken hid! It was awesome! Then they went to the 11:00 service cuz Mom had to sing again and Shane picked me up and off we went. And here I am again. I did see my Dad at one of the services, but he has been violently ill over the weekend...poor man...so it was brief indeed. 

I'll see everyone again in 2 weeks when they come up for Carmina Burana. But the fact that I won't set eyes on him for 2 weeks practically tears my heart out of my chest. I know its cheesy, and I'll definately survive. I know I will, but it hurts like a mother and depresses me a bit. What can I do? I chose this route myself. Can't complain now. The summer is so close and then we'll see each other everyday like we used to. I can't wait. Anyway, the important thing is that Jesus is just the best, most constant thing in my life right now. I love Him. Sorry it was long and rambling. Peace out."

Well, soon enough, I suppose."

I would just like to point out that while this is a damn good battle cry, it reminds me of MB, 10th grade or so, ""Beware, the wrath of Kathryn swings low upon your head!""

Or perhaps even 9th grade with the illustious Mr. Grieves suggesting that we yell ""Your bombastic verbosity chagrins us, cretan Seniors!"" at the pep assemblies where they yelled ""Go home Freshman!"" This was of course  in between his mad bagpipe playing, consummate lying and serenading of those unfortunate couples who decided to make out in front of his classroom in the hallway. He was quite a busy man, as I recall.

Because I started on this path, I would just like to remember In Requiem the wonders of Dos-Mauve (ah! my gorge!) and also to remind you MB  of the time Ryan whats-his-name wrote ""Je veux ___________le chat."" I will put an end to this nonsense. Hopefully life becomes more interesting shortly."

"event","I have to laugh at myself sometimes: harshly and with self-deprecation, but its laughter none the less.

I am so damn tired of doing things subconsciously because of how it appears to other people. To Hell with common expectations. What kind of way is that to live your life? I want to do something so selfish that I KNOW deep down that I am doing it purely for myself. Not because I think someone will be impressed by it. 

I am exhausted of living life through the eyes of others. I want to taste, to experience, to feel for one resplendent moment that my body is alive rather than just knowing it. I am desperate to stop understanding the world and life from observance and what I've read. 

I want fiercely to grab life up, to gulp it down, dance with it until I'm dizzy and intoxicated. I'm tired of being scared and tied down; I want to fling off my skin, my inhibitions and fly. That sort of flight would be so incredibly fulfilling I would scream with the pleasure of it.

The self-imposed limitations, the calculation: Stupid, Living for a now that is ever-changing...the tempo of my heartbeat. I want to have a hell of a ride before I settle my life. Vibrance and complete satisfaction, that I would settle for.

I need to stretch myself beyond this cookie cutter form of what I am. And the knowledge that these aching desires that cascade from my very fingertips are brought on by jealousy and fear makes me want to vomit. I am DONE with those emotions because for one, what have they ever done for me, and by God I want out!

Funny, That sweet aftertaste gets replaced with my own salty, bitter tears."

"event","Yup, being home absolutely ROCKED my world, despite the obvious setbacks of having clipped wings. Ah well, it was more than worth it to be around people who love me and hug me alot. My walls were such a friendly yellow color, and my sleep is greatly improved at home (no Tylenol PM there, let me tell you). Lets see...I played mother to my sisters on the two days they had off, one a snow day and the other curriculum day. Running people around and cooking and stuff was pretty enjoyable while I had a fabulous array of Led Zeppelin and the Who in my truck. Shane's dad also may have given me a lead to a great new band...which is technically old; moot point, anyway, the Grand Funk Railroad...um, AWESOME. So I got to see the ball and chain a decent amount, even though our colleges conspired to make sure we wouldn't have the same break. Ah well. I shoveled us out and possibly janked up my back, though if thats what did it, it didnt react until 4 days later. Then Ken got back safely from Taiwan, bringing us all fun presents. He was back for like 2 days and then he left to work the boy's Chrysalis flight...Chris Fader was on that flight, I heard the candlelight rocked too. Fun things all. Now it is Monday and I'm already swamped again. ARG.

Shane's family has been wooing me, I think. I'm not always at my ease around them; they are always laughing and joking and quite truthfully its rather exhausting. Not that I don't love them, because quite honestly how could I not? But when your family is beautiful and talented and funny without trying, and your sister is gorgeous and skinny, and her boyfriend reminds me of Freshman year when my friend had a HORRIBLE crush on him, its pretty impossible to imagine how I feel. Its not them, its how they make me feel about myself. Anyway, they want me to spend time with them, so they're luring me out. Its quite endearing. His parents come to this hokey spaghetti dinner my former youth group put on to raise money for ASP. Then they invite us out to Sangrio, some Spanish restaurant with live Flamenco dancing and Spanish guitairists, then to a Salsa club upstairs. Right up my alley. And when they find out my passion for Artichoke hearts...you can all guess what happens. They seem so eager to connect with me on a meaningful level. I get in my own way sometimes too. It'll all work out I know, but sometimes it seems too much. Like I said, exhausting. At least they like me.

Shane and I took Liz to see 'Hitch' on Saturday. What a cute movie, I highly recommend it. My dad took me out to lunch at a Japanese restaurant one day too, which was pretty frigging sweet. I love my family, even if Sarah is developing a bit of an ego. Who can blame her, right? She's really talented. Liz is starting to shine in her own respect too, with her voice and everything. Life is just good. And now my roommate questions for next year seem to be answered by God. Things are just coming together. I still can't wait for summer though. God is just amazing right now. The praise band did Trading My Sorrows in church Sunday and even threw in the LaiLais for all us former senior high kids in the front row. Found my sisters old dress that is gonna be gorgeous for Gala. Amanda is letting me burn the other John Mayer CD since I'm so stingy. Easter's coming up which means an excuse to shop. Only not so awesome thing right now is the fact that I left my pillow at home. So I'm cuddling up with Bob the Tomato at night (shout out to Stina Mae!!!). Anyway, the fact remains that I'm swamped. So I'm gonna go do some stuff so I can get to sleep early...I'm already pretty sleepy, which is an ill wind that blows no good. I'm not ashamed to admit that plucking my eyebrows is on the list. In the immortal words of Kip Dynamite...""Peace Out."""

"event","I hate my period...hate my uterus...HATE THEM. Now that thats on the record, let me move on my saying that there is NO ONE more ready for break than I am. Screw exotic locations, how about time to sit and not feel guilty for wasting valuable time? 

The most taboo thing I can think of is to admit that I miss high school...I mean obviously not all of it, but I've found that there were many benefits there that I feel the lack of these days. I thought college would get me away from the friggin idiots of high school. No. They still exist. You just live next door to them now. And they leave trails of vomit outside of your door as presents. In all truthfullness, I don't really miss high school, I'm just crabby today because Alma sucks for me right now. Everything is tinted beneath the insistent haze of pain in my ""uteral area."" Pretzels are helping. So is the thought of sleep. This heating pad is making me very sleepy... I'm thinking a nap is going to be necessary.

You know whats great though? My bed is in a little sunspot right now and its not too cold outside, so I can smell fresh air and curl up and drift off...I miss my old true friends, like the tested and true hicks from South Lyon that I just adore. I remembered when I passed out in the hallway when we were going to see Cyrano (remember MB?), and that damned 3 hour AP english test, yeah but that class rocked! Fun times all...maybe if I sleep now I'll dream that its the summertime and I'm through with classes and NOT stuck in the middle of a cow pie field. Tristopher's Candlelight on Saturday, and Amanda, we'll do the Panera thing next Friday. 

I wish I could think of something witty to say right now, but I really can't...just go to this link for a good time (for lack of something that requires brain power), I am going to nap. Make a concerted effort not to pee your pants. Peace.

"event","Holy long time since Live Journal update, Batman! I've decided it would be therapeutic to continue my efforts on this front. Merely because of how stressed school has made me lately and how I think I contracted some weird form of flu that makes me sleep for 14 hours at a time if possible. Ah well, its almost the middle of term.

So my sister finally went on Chrysalis, but guess who hasn't gotten to talk to her since she got back? ME. Friggin snow storm ruined all my high hopes, but I really can't complain since I will be home for a week starting on Friday. Anyway...so my stepdad is randomly in Taiwan and my mini Daschund had surgery because she had like 6 kidney stones...also, Shane's dog Katie who always sniffed my crotch when I came over has cancer and it makes me really sad. She's ok right now, but at some point she'll get noticably worse and be in a lot of pain...I have been so emotional for no reason lately and the thought of that makes me want to cry.

Back to the Chrysalis deal, my dad and mom and Liz and Shane came up to a choir concert on Friday night and um, yeah, we all had dinner TOGETHER. Talk about weird and tense. Like, oh, ok these are my divorced parents acting like they never split up for the benefit of everyone there. I was happy though in a really selfish way. That's how weddings and graduations, ect will be though, so I should be glad they are so cool around each other. I really do love my dad despite how badly he screwed up in the past. We all get multiple 2nd chances, don't we? 

On the way to Candlelight, I got to be with Shane and Amanda simultaneously which was also rather awkward, but I loved it. She was one of my close friends and I love her dearly, but me and Shane have gotten so much shit from people for being together, not always to our faces either, that it makes me cautious. I don't care what people say though, because for a long time before we even dated he was the one I could talk to about anything. When people get together, we tend to get petty...anyway, Amanda was never like that. She might have found a guy at GVS too which I am SUPER STOKED about, after years of Kenzie (and I don't mean that bitterly at ALL) she deserves someone to make her feel as special and beautiful as she is.

While Alma has started to feel more like home, it seems you have to be a partier to fit in with the majority of the people. I have my quiet niche just like back at home, but I think next year I might be forced to join a sororeity to make life liveable. I can't believe the first year is almost over! Its so great and thats just closer to first, study abroad and next graduation and FREEDOM. But I'm enjoying time here despite horrible Economic testing tactics and some religious cliqueiness that is really unappealing. 

One thing that is irritating is that apparently people take advantage of me. Like they can unload on me and I'm happy to let them do that but then that seems to be the extent of the relationship. It kind of pisses me off and hurts because who really likes being blown off, you know? Oh well, I'm sure God has His reasons...meanwhile, I really think I'm getting fat and I need to do something about it. Swimsuit season approaches (hopefully...somewhere beneath the snow). Anyway, thats all I have in me tonight. Peace out."

Here's something, it snowed so much that I couldn't make it all the way to my dad's last night after me and my friends went to see Phantom of the Opera. I just stayed at my mom's for the night because the truck sucks butt in the winter. On that note, I have always hated f-ing Christine. She is such a bia, she leads on poor Eric and Raoul is pansy! I cried so hard at the end, I always do. It was very well done though. Worth the blizzard, I'd say. Next on the list is for sure Meet the Fokkers. Even though my dad warned me to bring something to chuck at Barbara Streisand (shout out to my Repub friends!!!)

Well, other than the usual holiday bustle of being a ping-pong kid with a boyfriend...did that sound bitter? Anyway, besides that I am stoked to give my presents out!!!

I'm going to dry my hair and then work on that cursed portfolio for HOURS. At least I get the room to myself tonight, Lauren has a band concert. Also, she actually cleaned up her mess! A miracle, or sign from God? No, her parents are just coming up. They can take her NOW.

Quite interesting...look out Shane. I wonder if there are French emo boys? MB and I used to wonder if there were Frenchies with lisps. I kind of want to go to Paris and pretend like I have a lisp. Just to mess with people's heads. 

So I'm being forced to kind of sort of kick Lauren out of the room even though she wants to leave. How does that work? Well, I'd totally dig the privacy that's for sure. Then me and Pierre could get it on whenever we wanted...just kidding.

You know what Shane told me the other day? He said he thought I was going to end up losing my virginity to a college professor. Isn't that random? It sounds like some scenario out of a teen soap opera. Even better, a Lifetime movie! Props to those hearty souls who craft the scripts of such illustious films as 'I Know My First Name is Stephen'.

Noel's funeral is today. And I'm not there. My mom called last night and I haven't been able to cry at all here. Just have to suck it up until I'm back amongst the living who give a damn.

Is it bad to miss the physical aspects of a relationship? Because I definately do. I suppose I'm more ""lusty"" than I would like to imagine myself. I guess 'Pierre' brings that out in me.

Some days I just feel like a pile of crap. I've been exercising and everything and I'm just stuck with my ugly pear shapedness. Is that even a word? I just hate going back to hang out with his perfect family, ESP Carmen. Its just torture to sit there and know I don't even come close to comparing with her. I can't even not like her, because she's too nice! She's one of those rare gorgeous and genuinly nice people. I know that sounds self-pitying, I just wonder when he's going to realize thaat he's attatching himself to a shrew, and not even an attrative one at that. 

Am I crazy to think we are actually going to work out like a fairy tale high school sweetheart couple? He's the first boy that was ever even interested in me. I don't know, I guess I'll find out somewhere along the line. I was about to compare it to what my dad did to my mom, but I respect Shane too much to do that.

His dad sent me an email with a link to an animated menorah. Weird, but characteristic. How can I marry into that family! I'm so under-qualified.

Oh well, I still have a buttload to do with exams looming. I wonder how many essays I can possibly have assigned to me at one time. Christmas break is much needed."

"event","So, Lauren wants to move out and the idiot savant HD won't let her. Apparently they don't let Freshmen live alone, even though I know about 5 who had no problem with the process and are happily enjoying their single doubles...Oh wait, those are the ones with problems concerning their roommates. Am I not capable of living alone! I think I most certainly am. This HD is just the remnant of a breed of Neo-Fascists who enjoy inflicting pain. Oh, the torment! Tonight we have scheduled a meidated discussion where Lauren will confront me with her issues. We have spent the better part of the afternoon concocting plans as to what these issues will be. To quote a wise man, ""I'm surrounded by friggin idiots."" *Agonized cry that resembles animal dying in the wild* More later from the front lines."

"event","Why is it that I only excel at procrastination? 

Its already 2 in the afternoon and I've done, um, SQUAT of what I have to do. When will the supply of essay questions ever run out? 

I am really sick of being here...long distance relationships suck, its like tearing out my soul whenever he walks away. I never thought I'd get to feel this way about anyone.

Well, any MAN that is. I actually am trying to trust him. I love him and I hate him because he makes me so vulnerable to hurt. The passions are too intwined for my own good.

I need to dry my hair."

High standards are important to you, and you do everything to meet them.

"event","So after hearing my friends talk about Live Journal for like, an eternity, I finally took the opportunity to make one of my own. Call it procrastination if you like...yeah, you'd be right. College is kicking my ass right now. Noel Gelfund was killed in a car crash and I feel numb from the neck down. The only thing that won't shut down is my infernal brain. What does a person do when they realize that for all their Christian beliefs, they look death in the face and fear it? Can't really talk to anyone here, because its so damned cliquey. And I sincerely doubt that anyone at my church -- oh wait -- my PARENTS'S church -- could help me that way either. I am reduced to some childish grief that irritates my roommate and steals my sleep. It makes all the crap going on with school seems so irrelevant. We are just fragile beings and sometimes its hard for me to believe that God really cares about every detail. If that sounds horrible, I know it does, but its what I'm thinking in any case. So many friggin' papers! They force me out of my reveries to actual reality...but such a tentative reality, I don't even know what its worth. What did I ever accomplish in high school? Like I was ever something; the English department award, the lead in two musicals, summa cum laude, Carnegie Hall...what does that even say about anything? Its difficult not to feel worthless sometimes. One brief happiness is that I have a Christmas card from my idol - Laura Bush - on my desk RIGHT NOW. So awesome. Also, my two-timing roomie is OUT, I seem fond of the caps today. Oh well. Let's see. Can't wait until Christmas, can't wait to go home and see the Phantom which they made into a movie. Can't wait to kiss my boyfriend again. Can't wait until menopause when this crap is over with. CAN DEFINATELY wait to see Shane's perfect, beautiful family. I always feel like crap around them, and its inescapable around the holiday season. Oh well. I have some scheduling issues to work out which might turn out alright, we shall see. Off to do more pointless homework."

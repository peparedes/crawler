<h2>You are a BDSM Slave!</h2>
It's strictly ""Yes please, Master"" for you.  You enjoy being dominated 
so much you're willing to be totally submissive for it.  You do 
whatever your master tells you to and you take whatever they give you, be it 
love, punishment, or a big spanking session. Hopefully you've learned 
the art of orgasming on command, or you'll soon be sorry.

"event","You have come to a place mute of all light, where the wind bellows as the sea does in a tempest. This is the realm where the lustful spend eternity. Here, sinners are blown around endlessly by the unforgiving winds of unquenchable desire as punishment for their transgressions. The infernal hurricane that never rests hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine, whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them. You have betrayed reason at the behest of your appetite for pleasure, and so here you are doomed to remain. Cleopatra and Helen of Troy are two that share in your fate.

last night this one woke at like 3 a.m for no reason what so ever.. this one  was sweating like crazy in the middle of winter go figure, but this one hates when she wakes up like that then for whatever reason when this one returns to go back to bed, then get up when shes supposed to she feels overly exhausted... which comes to a weird dream this one had.... dont remember the exact dream, but towards the end... this one started having an asthma attack (in the dream) and there was nothing left in the inhaler... this one awoke to having what felt like a real asthma attack even though  she dont have asthma.... weird huh? so browsed the web. found this about the dream....

Asthma

To dream that you have asthma, refers to insecurity and emotional instability. There is a lot of stress and tension around you. 

To dream that you are breathing rapidly, indicates that you are experiencing some anxiety, tension, or fear concerning a new situation in your waking life.

To dream that you cannot breathe, indicates that you are feeling exhausted.  so for the most part that was true about feeling exhausted... strange huh?

well this one has a few things to do, and clean up supper dishes. .. toodles journal world :)"

"event","A true slave is indeed a special creature. She embodies extremes. She is strong in her commitment, and yet she easily bends to do her Master's bidding. She is passionate in her heart, yet she is obedient and docile at His slightest word. She serves her Master with all her heart, and in this she finds contentment. She is not of this earth, and yet she is so earthy that she revels in being trod on like the earth beneath her Master's feet. 

As a woman she craves to be a slave. As a slave she craves to be bound to her Master by both His desire for her and His power over her. She knows how much she needs him: she requires a Master in order to be a slave. She respects her Master above other men because He has subdued her and keeps her in submission. Ropes, chains, rules, punishments ... they are all symbols of His Mastery. Even more, she respects that He does not allow her the freedom to rebel or escape. His Mastery is complete, because it is both internal within her, and external, surrounding her. She wears the symbols of her status of slave proudly and defiantly. They are symbols of His victory over her; they are symbols of her love and of her life. 

A true slave looks into her Master's eyes for approval. She has turned her back on the world around her. Indeed, the world outside is an arena in which she can prove her slavery. After each test, each foray, she looks to Him, proud of her defiance of social convention, proud of her proof of His ownership, proud of belonging even more to Him. A true slave finds happiness in proving that she truly does belong to Him -- and she never stops trying."

"event","i am tired of these dreams... this time it was about my 
father, whom in my dream had died... i remember being a bit 
cold and bitter then breaking down and crying to where i 
had awoke in tears....

so i looked upon the net to find the answer of this 
particular dream

Meaning of dreams and dreaming about death 
When we dream of death, our emotions run high. Feelings of 
terror, anxiety or even liberation can dominate our mood 
upon waking. As with any other type of dream, there is no 
one answer for what the dream means. Generally speaking, 
however, dreams about death signify much needed change in 
our lives. Such dreams typically herald symbolic rather 
than literal death. In this way, death dreams let us know 
that some part of the self needs to be radically reworked, 
whether it be one's attitudes, emotions, or relationships."

"event","so yeah today was another day of just breaking down... like 
that is anything unusual....

i dont know how to get past it.. past any of the tears i 
cry everyday... i dont even know why i do sometimes.. maybe 
im just fooling myself as a person,

maybe i dont really belong on earth, i was to be put in 
hell but got trapped here, is it the devil over taking my 
body and i cant get free from him? or is it god giving me 
lifes challanges to see how strong of a person i can be.?

im not a strong person, i sometimes i think i am, but im 
not.. im a wimpy person, full of fears and sorrows and 
depressions... 

i know we all go through lifes problems and we can all deal 
with them one way or the other, but why cant mine just 
end... im almost 30 and ive been going through them since i 
was a young child...from being molested as a child, being 
beaten by ex's paralized from accidents, inpregnated and 
left, then here we are to the current date.

i have a child that is learning disabled is that because of 
me not being book smart? Is it because i cant teach her how 
things need to be tought? is she going to grow up being  as 
smart as a cookie? how can she when i cant teach her.

im tired of being in debt... i am not even comfortable 
anymore, have to deal with shut off notices, and just pay 
the few bucks i can untill i get some more support in, how 
can i feel like a good mom when im struggling just to keep 
a roof over her head....

i cant keep a car to save my life, always a junker or a 
clunker, now im carless again... how can i get groceries, 
wash clothes, even cash my check thats still sitting here?
i dont have much of a family to help me out, or even give a 
lending ear....

i am a depressed person... i cant get through it my car 
accident is what made me afraid of everything from a stupid 
spider to driving in snow... i mean for goodness sakes i 
cry if a spider is by me... 

my friends r few, busy with their own lives cant even come 
out to say hello no matter how many times ive been there, 
im not far from them, *sighs*

there is just so much in my mind, i cant release... writing 
helps, crying helps, but its just a mere temporary fix for 
these problems.... oh well....

ill write again later again if i need to let out some 
stresses"

it was a great time, and best experiance of my life.. for 
my Master has made His slave the happies little slave in 
the world...

W/we made love... the first time i was nervous, but it was 
oh so right... He was made for me, and i for Him.
almost like 2 molds that fit well together as O/one!

His train got in late, and of course now His train was 
late again, i hope that stupid amtrak works out its quirks 
in due time.... what a painin the ass...

speaking of ass, He had made love to my ass, it was so 
painful at first, but the 2nd time was really nice, still 
some pain but not as much...in due time, it will be a 
breeze.  

His hands wrapped so nicely around my neck i just couldnt 
get enough of it...i cant even explain the feelings i got 
when He had a hold on my by my throat, the harder the 
better, if i couldhave pressed His hands deep withen my 
body i would be dead, i know my limits, but makes me so 
wet just thinking about it......

i love Master so much, i am truley in love with Him, 
wouldn't have it any other way...

He had left some of His cologne here, mmmmm it reminds me 
of Him, i had put some on tonight just to sit here and 
complete my tasks like a good little cum loveing slave...

"event","i sit here and anxiously await for thursday to come... 
Master is coming in for a visit, i couldn't be happier :) 
This Man has shown me there is more to life then abuse, 
humiliation, disrespect, and most of all hated love..

He is so full of life everytime i speak to Him, He makes 
me smile even when im down, sad, crying, or not feeling 
well.  

He has made my life so complete... 

younger i have always had these feelings deep inside, i 
was unaware to what they were... a feeling  of lostness, 
scared, needing to be had...

as i grew i always just put these feelings aside, for when 
i tried to explain these feelings to others they just said 
your fucked up girl... noone could ever understand them.

an old friend of mine for many many years had talked to me 
about being a slave... i just looked in amazement like 
what??????  he assured me it is something i would be 
interested in and nothing  harmful... so i accepted the 
role, and found years later i was not happy to what has 
been going on....he had differant men ""rapeing"" me, using 
torture devices that he made out of bizarre items.. would 
try to scar me up and humiliate me in public... i tried to 
disapear from the Man i once knew as a life long family 
friend.

years later as i dabbled on the internet i had bumped into 
differant types of chat rooms, one being owned by Kenny 
also known as X.  He had explained the room to me, and i 
kind of just opened my eyes in interest.. thinking ""hmm 
this sounds so familiar""

i had played with a few men (dateing wise) in the 
past..and found some of my sexual interests had scared 
them... i had always placed Their hands on my neck, or 
always kept their hands on my face close to me.. knowing 
its a strong hand to protect me....i wasnt aware still 
even having a master why this  was something i craved, 
even though the things he did, just made me more scared. i 
cried many helpless nights thinking that ill always be an 
abused victim.. even not into the life i had past bf's 
beat me, break my bones, one even crashed me in a car 
wreck leaving me paralized for 2 years from neck down...
i cant count the endless facial scars and body scars i had 
recieved from such trgedys...

this chat room which was called ""As-You-Wish"" was pretty 
interesting, but i always kept it on the down low, of my 
perverse thoughts.. actions and things that were happening 
to me. One day a Lady came in (LadyBlueRose)that knew 
Kenny, and they were always so loveing sounding, close 
like a sister and a brother, from keeping watch i 
frequented a few websites They would post. which started 
my little smiles and grins. I had asked many questions 
here and there, and that opened me up some, to Kenny more 
then anyone.

Months and even a year later, i had grown in to the 
society of the lifestyle of D/s.  i had a better 
understanding what was happening to me, my feelings and 
thoughts and to find out they indeed where not perverse, 
but only natural from one said slave.  i also had learned 
that my current Master was not being a true Dom, but a 
abusive Dom, True Doms do not act the way He was... i had 
asked to be released, He wouldnt let me, then finally 
couple months later, he finally did... He had moved to 
florida and gotten married...

Kenny and i withen that past year had gotten really close, 
talked all the time, shared secrets, tears, heartaches...
even in the bad times He and i have had, i always will 
commend Him on how He had saved me from feeling so down 
about the lifestyle. He is and was my mentor.  

times have gone on, few chats here, a few dates there...
i had started hanging out in another BDSM server, where 
Kenny had reopend AYW... where i bumped into LBR once 
again... i was more open with Her this time, i was not so 
scared of the Dom/mes of the world like i was in the past. 
in talking She had  as well turned into my current Mentor.
She introduced me into a BBW BHM group She was a part of, 
long story short, Sha had opened Her own, and that's where 
the current day comes to play...

days went on.. i met a complete assfuck who claimed to be 
Dom, in reality wasnt Dom at all... just looking for a 
play toy for Him and His wife. One day, a Gentleman 
stumbled to the room on evening, i notced the name.. 
The_12THKnight... the name always made me feel fuzzy 
inside, for its a powerful name, and power always peaks my 
interest... so in talking here and there, i came to 
realize ""DUH"" this is LBR's husband and yes i have spoken 
to Him many times... We became to be little chatter bugs 
in PM... started to talk about the past and catching up on 
things W/we never really knew about the O/other. In days, 
i was under consideration by Him, then shortly after i was 
blessed to become His slave.  

2 months have gone by, i couldnt be happier then to be His 
slave, he makes me feel beautiful, even when i dont see 
it, to me, i am a hidious creature put on the earth for 
nothing more then tears and torment of lifes givings. 
He has made me see, that i am human, i am loved, i am 
beautiful.. and nobody and nothing should make me feel the 
way i do with the negativity ... 

to today this current date, i have this to say to the Ones 
in my life.... i am forever grateful for Kenny to break me 
free, i am Grateful for LBR to show me kindness , 
friendship and Love and to my Master, the one i adore and 
love with my most inner soul, i thank You for being the 
best Man in the universe, who has tought me to not be 
scared, to not hate myself, and to  keep my head held 
high, there is nothing more powerful then to be curagous, 
and strong! and to know i'm not alone and always loved.

To the cloth that blinds
Sensation induced shudder
Firm caress from a strict lover
Pleasure becomes pain
Then sweetness again
Sharp retorts fill the space
Bound limbs move with grace
Reddened buttocks warm and glow
Thrust in the air, proudly on show
Nipples are clamped stinging and hot
Moisture betrays the eager, wet spot
Orgasm beckons but must be controlled
Power over that my Master He does hold
""Cum slave!"" releases the tension so sweet
Climax engulfs the body complete
With bondage undone Master holds tight
""Oh what a good slave you were tonight."""

"event","Above all else he cherishes his slave, in the knowledge 
that the gift she gives him is the greatest gift of all. 
He is demanding and takes full advantage of the power 
given to him, but knows howto share the pleasure that 
comes from that precious gift.

He is in control of himself first and foremost, so that he 
may control others. As a stern and demanding Master, he 
can cause his slave to cry real tears. As the consummate 
lover, he will then kiss the tears away, without stepping 
out of character.

In times of trouble, a Master will leave the roles behind, 
to be a supportive friend and partner, never forgetting 
that this is still a loving relationship between two 
caring individuals. He is quick to understand the 
differences between fantasy and reality. He would never 
ask a slave to put him before her career, or family, just 
to satisfy his own pleasure.

To win his slave's mind, body, spirit, soul, and love, he 
knows he must first win her trust. He will show his slave 
humor, kindness, and warmth. He must always show her that 
his guidance and tutoring is knowledgeable and deserving 
of her attention, that this is a man she can learn from, 
and trust his direction.

He is romantic enough to be protective and chivalrous. 
When called upon, he will fight for his lady's honor. He 
proves to her that he is someone she can lean on, and 
depend on.

When it comes time to teach his slave her lessons of 
obedience, he is a strong and unyielding professor. He 
will accept no flaw, nothing less than perfection from his 
student. Never does he use discipline without a good 
reason. When he does it is always with a knowledgeable and 
careful hand.

He is always open to communication and discussion, always 
ready to hear her wants and needs. He is patient, taking 
time to learn her limits, and knowing that as her trust of 
him , grows so will they. He never has to demand ritual 
behavior by her. She responds to him out of the want of 
pleasing him. Compliance comes from the wanting to please, 
not the fear of punishment. He understands the fragile 
nature of mind and body and never violates the trust given 
to him.

He is secure enough to laugh at himself and the 
absurdities of life. Open minded enough to learn new 
things. Strong enough to grow. His tools are mind, body, 
spirit, soul, and love. He understands that each partner 
gains most from pleasuring the other. And both of them 
knows that love and trust are the only bindings that truly 
hold."

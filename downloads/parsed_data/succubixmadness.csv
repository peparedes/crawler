"event","so i have decided that imnot going to go into the service. well maybe but later on down the road. id really rather get a job and go to college, i want to earn my education im sick of having shit handed to me. so im going to go apply to cleaning authority tomarrow and see if that takes if not then ill look elsewhere. but i want to make a life for myself not just stock up on whats given to me and do with it as i see fit. i want to earn my place. i want to prove to myself that im not a complete fuck up and a failure at my own life. and i really have shannon to thank for my change of heart she doesnt know it but she helped me put a lot in perspective and for that i thank her. and i realize it mioght sound like im doing it for her but im not its all for me. i think shannon and i need a for real break from seeing eachother just to see if we ""restart"" if not then well maybe we were meant to be lovers. then itll just be a questions of us wanting eachother. but i hate the thought of doing because i feel like id just be stepping aside to let kyle step right in. i know its not how it really is but its how it feels. but yeah just figured id let you all know."

"event","so i havent heard from my navy recruiter in like over a month and ive been toying with the idea of going back for the army because they are more prompt about getting you out. so i went trick or treating with jennifer last night, it was pretty fun we got a good amount of booty. lol. shes so easy to scare its funny. so the day that ends it all with shannon is drawing nearer. i saw her on monday, she got her senior pics that night, im not gunna lie it made me feel good to know i saw them before kyle and that she really missed me and wanted me to stay the night. and my phone the other night fell under my bed, how i dont know but i found two of my tarot cards which was pretty sweet. so i stopped by the school yesterday to pick jennifer up and i saw ashley and gave her a kiss and a big hug. and then i kinda lunge-kicked at shannon after doing a cartwheel. she asked me if i was ok i said i was fine and gave her a big hug. i went as a vampire, jennifer and i got my hair to stand up all over. it was amazing.but yeah i ended up talking to jessica spect yesterday and who decided to call jessica just to chit chat? the corprol. so this morning i let the dogs out and i found the corprol's card sitting on my front stoop, just chillin. and so i called him and we talked a bit it was pretty sweet. whats even better is that their moving out of the dort mall and moving near sam's club, which is quite a bit closer. but eah i just decided that fate is finally on my side i think. but now i gotta call shannon and be sure she got my message and then we have to discuss if shes going to come over tomarrow to watch beauty and the beast or not. ok, well thats all for now. buh-bye."

"event","thats the song that i thought about while talking to shannon in the car tonite. she called after her concert and she needed a ride home so i figured, why the hell not? and so i went and picked her up and well, once again we knew exactly what was on eachother's minds. so yeah after i take her out for her birthday next saturday we're not going to see eachother anymore. there was a lot said and right now its all just a big jumble...im a little in shock. even though ive been thinking about it for sometime now, it really happened. and i was the one who did it, not her. thats what i cant belive. and she thought it was just going to be a temporary kinda thing, and when she mentioned that i about died. i then told her that i meant that other than maybe randomly seeing eachother in public i didnt want to see her again. pretty much while im in the service i mean 4 years should be enough time to find out if i actually got over her or if im just pretending right? she got mad at me when i told her i hadnt really decided yet if i was going to tell her when i was leaving in person or over the phone or at all. she wanted to know why i still wanted to go through with her b-day, i told her because i wanted to.oh well...i guess i'll know more later. i kinda feel like dorothy right now, shannon is the twister that put my house in oz, and the yellow brick road is my way of getting through this all. ""even if i cut the pie in 16 pieces instead of 8 im still going to have a pie"" sorry a quote from tonite that i think is going to stick with me for awhile. its what i said to shannon about loving her."

"event","i took this from a bullitein that shannon had posted on myspace. i figured id be safer to post it here rather than someplace someone else might see it.

So tell me alittle about you[and me]. 
 
So, to start off..who are you? annette

Do I call you anything spacific? [and what might it be] nettie

When did we meet? [and how] we met when i was in 8th grade at bre's b-day party.

What is something that you remember specifically about us from around that time? that i really realised that what i felt for you wasnt for normal people. you really made me realise that i was different from everyone else.

What is the last thing you saw that reminded you of me? [and why] my eyes. you always tell me how pretty they are or when they change color.

How often do you see me? [and what are we doing] none at all anymore. but it used to be often. and anything from cuddling to coloring to some things in between.
Do you hear any specific songs that remind you of me? [or just make you think of me] ....yes

What do you like about me the most ?[physically and personally] phys? ummm...your overall body shape, and your butt. pers? you usually say whats on your mind and you dont like to take shit from other people.

What do I like about you the most? [or just a little. im not that picky really] *shrugs* i really dont know

What would you do with me if you had me for a whole day?[honestly] given ideal conditions you know what id do. now? prolly just sit and talk to you and watch a movie or two.

Am I somewhat of a good person? [according to your standards] sometimes

What do we do together that is amazing? [really. besides just standing next to eachother:) ] well were not usually just standing we sit alot around eachother. be together

What is your favorite passtime? [would you let me indulge in it with you] cloud/ star gazing. i wanted to yes, but i never really had the chance.

How do you feel when you are around me? [humor me] i used to feel like i was the most important person in the world. now...i feel like you dont want me to matter anymore.

Tell me something that you just want to [no spacific. just suprise me.] im always going to love you. whether you want me too or not. whether i want to or not. i am. and sometimes i hate myself..just a littel bit for it."

"event","so today was alright. i could have gone smoother. first i go tme and my recruiter lost on the way to take me home from the gym.i didnt get my laundry done so i had no really clean clothes for when i went and picked up shannon. so things had been kinda rocky/strained between me and shannon as of lately. but thats all ove4r now as we are doing the whole gt the fuck out of my life thing. well at least thats my veiw point. she just hopes that ater 2 years im just a passing fancy and the time we spend apart she'll use to find that out. wtf ever. two years of my life as just a passing fancy. dont think so, but maybe im just reaching. but then again i gotta keep in mind it was my fault for falling in love with a 16 yr old girl who can barely decide what shoes to wear. but just...i dont know anymore. shes going to call me tomarrow, for why i can only imagine. but i guess ill find out. all i know is i kinda resent her a little bit now. but i still love her. when she said she wanted to stay away from eachother until she got over it, meaning me, i told her i wished i could say the same but i didnt exactly have an eternity to waste. she didnt really say much after that. but then again i pretty much voiced everything we were both thinking, because im really good at knowing what shes going to say or what shes thinking. but just....*sigh* its not even really worth ranting about. i just hope that if and when we do cross eachothers paths again we'll be ready for each other."

"event","i havent updated in a very long time. but the most recent thing that has happened is that shannon and i went out on a date. it was fun we went to see the lakehouse. awsome movie. i tried to get shannon to dance with me afterwards but she wouldnt do it. then after that i took her to rich's to hang out for a bit then i took her home and she sat with mikie till he left then i fed her lasanga. then shannon my dad and i all sat and watched ultra violet. i satin the chair with shannon and we held hands and stuff when we could without my dad seeing. when the movie ended shannon had to be taken home so we went in my room so i could make a phone call and so she could get her purse. i ended up needing to call tiff back because shannon decided that going an hour and a half without kissing me was long enough for the day. so i called tiff back like 20 mins later. then me and shannon just kinda laid in my bed and kissed some more and then i decided that if we didnt leave soon then we werent gunna be leaving at all. so i took her home and gave her a goodnight kiss and thanked her for a wonderful time. i went back to my house and i walked in the door and my moms like ""you need to sit down"" i just went oh shit. then my dads like ""when theres something you need to tell me annette you should tell me you shouldnt be afraid to tell me things."" HA!!! easier said then done ya know? so then we had a discussion about me liking girls. hes now accusing my mom of keeping pretty much a shitload of secrets from him just because she respected my wishes and didnt tell him. i dont think ill tell him that a lot of other family members know about it. he doesnt understand why i wanted to keep it secret, so i asked him how i was supposed to expect that he'd just try when whenever he sees something remotely homosexual on t.v or something he makes sure everyone around him knows exactly how he feels about it. i also told him that shanon and i werent dating as of right now but it would be nice if we did start dating. even though i dont know how that would work with me going into the service. speaking of service im on this new diet, i only eat everyother day. my no eating days i have a vitamin tablet that i take, it has all my daily vitamins and such. so at least i dont go unnourished. i cant have juices but a lot of water and some powerade or gatorade or if i start to feel sick then i can have some friuts and veggies and im supposed to walk for at least 30 mins. and be working on my sit-ups and push-ups. so yeah thats about it for whats been going on lately. interesting isnt it?"

Once upon, and once up high
A dandy dream, what means to die?
Things to come, as life goes by
The core of human equation
Pentagram present the sign
A sign to save your eyes
Turn around, I'd like to know you
Everywhere and every why
The answer lay beyond the sky
Pass through the seven satellites pass on to the place we go to
(Learn to read!)
To rhyme, to count your primes
An earthly education
(Climb A Tree!)
In life in hopes to find
(The mid-space time - dilation)
On a Mansion World, the role's reversed
A slave becomes a master
On a Mansion World, the soul's converse
And life moves a little faster
We unify the universe
And arrive in the ever after
In the Mansion World, I might like to know you
Now and then it comes to mind
I draw upon a long lost time
So don't ask me why the angels won't cry 'cause you know what I've already told you
Memories of Urantia girls they race around my brain in swirls
You never ask me why the change is in the sky bring you up which to the hole
that you go through
And now you're off you've done the time
Prepare for divine invasion
As the spirit climbs Morontia minds
Ascend to the cosmic nation
On a Mansion World, the role's reversed
A slave becomes a master
On a Mansion World, the soul's converse
And life moves a little faster
We unify the universe
And arrive in the ever after
In the Mansion World, I might like to know you
New Urantia girl, everything's below you
On a Mansion World, the role's reversed
A slave becomes a master
On a Mansion World, the soul's converse
And life moves a little faster
We unify the universe
And arrive in the ever after
In the Mansion World, I might like to know you
Once upon, and once up high
A dandy dream, what means to die?


Come by you have come far
All I had I lost in the flood
Come sit with me at the bar
Tell me of progress strengthen my blood
No one here knows my name
I have traded my memories for things
But I remember you clearly
Do you remember that I used to sing

Why have you waited so long

Come by you have come far
Long since I saw you so how have you been
Come sit with me at the bar
How long since they told you that they had found him
No one here knows my name
I gave up my worries for one good thing
But I remember you clearly
Do you remember that I used to sing

Was it because I never told you
I was going away
That you waited so long
Was it because your fucking dreams
Meant nothing to me
That you waited so long

It runs from the top of my fingers
Into my hands
What is it I have been drinking
I do not understand
I thought I'd lost you my brother
I'm so glad you came
My regards to the ones that I love I miss them
Tell them I love them I miss them"

- List ten things you want to say to people but know you never will.
- Don't say who they are.
- Disable comments.
- Never discuss it again.

001. I'll never tell you how i really feel about you,how i feel like i could spend the rest of my life with you. how i would give almost anything just to hold you in my arms and feel the warm press of your lips on mine just once aain.

002. I think its stupid how youll let me make adult desiscions and choices but you wont let me be a kid. 

003. your an asshole,everyone else thinks your a great person and you can be. but your a womanizing asshole. 

004. I cant stand the way you treat me. you bring me close only to push me back out again. make up your mind so i can make mine up. i still think i have a chance with you, not gunna lie. but you have no right to treat me like you do, i mean yeah life can be pretty hardcore and shit but what you did to me was wrong and it pissed me off beyond all fucking belief. you say that you love me, and i see truth in your eyes, so why not treat me better? what i wouldnt give to just be able to tell you the things that i need to. 

005. I cant help but wonder, if I would have treated you different in the beginning if things would be different today? 

006. shut the fuck up!!! you think you know so much more than everyone but really you dont fucking know shit. you claim your getting treated like shit,well guess what? you treat people the same fucking way. do you even see us as humans? 

007. I cant stand you.the way you talk to other people, trying to scare them. constantly talking about killing yorself, know what? go right fucking ahead youll never have the balls to do it. i wouldnt miss you,not really.

008. Cant you just be happy for me? yeah its not what i originally planned but its my life dream.cant you just gowith it and be fucking happy for me? just a little bit? 

009. how can you say that? that you dont care how we treat them just because they did it to us ""first""? you know that they get raped andkilled and starved everyday that their in there? yeah they did it but weve been terrorizing them for so much longer. their still human beings and dont deserve to be treated like they are. fuck you. 

010. I hate you and your close-mindedness. you make us belive that HE hates everything that you think is wrong. I shouldnt have to change my ways to make your savoir love me. if he doesnt already then well fuck him, this is all hes getting. there are other religions in this world growup and look around you. there really isnt a cookie cutter machine. aquaint yourself with the outside world and the other side before you make up your mind."

""Etched in stone, my immortal shame
'Twas scrawled by unworthiest of hands.""
Cried noble, pointing fingers for his blame
For nigh he sinned; guilty he stands.

Trial held by ignorance for a jury,
Judged by ""God's"" hand, the tainted church,
And execution by hastened hurry,
From mortal idiocy's high perch.

Scorched alive to black ashes dead,
Entombed in a seal of mirror.
All done as the holy book said,
Invoking away their mortal fear.

From local lore, reflection's box hailed,
But legends lied and methods failed.


On nights, which Luna could shine not,
Came forth an undispelled phantom
Who's hellfire heart housed vengeance's plot,
His presence signaled by wolf's moonless anthem.

Hanged herself did many a virgin lass,
Possessed by noble's lost vengeful soul.
From fear and death, they dwindled fast,
Leaving barren, a town once full.

Irony sounds from their intent
As they burned for soul's salvation,
Yet sent it vengeful and Hell-bent
While his actions rang a loud declaration.

Wreaking unearthly havoc, ne'er could cease,
Haunting forever more, ne'er to find peace"

"event","its been awhile since ive fucked up like i always do....its been awhile but it all seems to disapear when im with you. but now i fear i no longer have that for we have fallen, and not into one another but away. its been awhile, but i can still remember just the way you taste. all i have to say is this....i love you, more than i could ever be able to put into words though i have tried, many times. you helped me write beautiful things, sometimes i felt as if i was flying. all i needed was to be in your arms. i never wanted things to go the way they have, but i now see it was naivity at its utmost. my hopes with you were nothing but a lost dream, a childs wish. but something else i needto say is that, you have hurt me, so much so that now i will always be looking over my shoulder with someone else. never really trusting myself let alone my partner. i feel as if i dont ever want to love again because of how far you made me fall. and nothing hurts worse then when you dont say you love me though i know you do, its there in your eyes when you think im not looking, its in the way you try oh so hard not to. i just need to know one thing....why? fuck man why did i have to meet someone like you, why did you have to hurt someone like me, why did i have to fall in love you, why did you make me love you, why did you make me hurt so fucking much why did you have to love me back?. i guss i finally realized i went from heaven to limbo when i noticed that the tears out numbered the smiles, hugs, kisses, cuddles, and i love yous. i just hope that some day i will get to taste those sweet lips one last time as i lay in your loving arms."

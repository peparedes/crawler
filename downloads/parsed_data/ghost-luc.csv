"event","<font size=2>I am 'eading back to Paris. I seem to 'ave outstayed my welcome at 'Ogwarts. I 'ave not said goodbye to Marly. She was just a little somezing on ze side, after all.

I zink I may 'ave broken Myrtle's 'eart. I find zis very <s>funny</s> interesting. Apparently she zought I was a nice ghost who loved 'er right up until today. All of my previous girlfriends have either seen through me or been at least suspicious. Myrtle was too trusting for 'er own good.

I 'ad fun at 'Ogwarts zough. Zank you everyone who made it enjoyable.

((OOC: Luc won't be very active from now on, but he may return in the future and turn Myrtle's life upside down! *dramatic music* This is just like a soap. ;D))</font>"

"event","<font size=2>Last week I sneaked down to ze crypts under ze greenhouses. Marlene is so pretty, so charming. We talked for a while, about death, Paris, and life at 'Ogwarts. She was pleased to see I am settling in 'ere. I don't think I will be going back to France for a while. Dare I say it... 'Ogwarts is my 'ome now?

<lj-cut text=""Private"">
Well, we got up to a bit more zan zat... hehe. I don't know why, but Myrtle never wants to do more zan just kiss, or 'old 'ands. And understandably, I get bored.

I 'ave been thinking about Marly a lot recently. Something tells me she 'ad an exciting life, but she never 'ad much time for romance. Well, I intend to change zat!

"event","<font size=2>It seems a lot of people and a squid misunderstood my last post.

When I said zat Marlene and I would make a great couple, I didn't actually mean I wanted to go out with 'er. 'Ow could you think zat? I love Myrtle; of course I do. I am <i>pleased</i> she is so 'appy. Maybe it is because I am French; zat is why you misunderstand me.

"event","<font size=2>If you've seen my profile, you will know my name is Luc. I am a ghost. I was born in 1962, and I died in 1979. For those of you who are mathematically incompetent, that made me 17 years old when I died.

How did I die? I jumped off the Eiffel Tower. Why? I don't consider that to be any of your business. I have not even told Myrtle, my girlfriend.

When I was alive I went to Beauxbatons. I assume most of you are from Hogwarts? Then I will not speak any more of my old school. I still have vague, patriotic feelings toward the place.</font>"

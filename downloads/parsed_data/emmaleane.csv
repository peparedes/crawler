If you didnt know im Emma Nelson and I am in grade 11 and I am 16! I go to degrassi cs and my father or should I say STEP FATHER MR.Simpson is a teacher there its kinda hard for me but im getting through it after all alot has happened this yeah good and bad. We had a campagin against this kid named Rick, cause he put a girl[Terri] in a coma last year. That didn't work out me being little miss save the world i stopped Alex from punching him. Then pitied him. Wrong i know so many kids picked on him, it drove him to bring a gun to school. Point a gun at me,and shoot jimmy.Which completely sucked! It was my fault, i started it...So then Sean,Ellie,Myself & Jay went with Sean to wasaga beachit was sad, yet i was happy<s>Sean apologized for everything.So Lately i've been going crazy!!! with the whole me having gonherra..eck! Thats a horriable word!</s>For those of you who haven't seen the play, it went REALLY good:)<s>Minus the whole Nate changing the kissing scene.I don't blame him though!</s> Anyways, right now i'm sitting at home, on my computer thinking about everything thats happened.Now summers over,and schools in session.Sigh..what fun?Another year at Degrassi High.

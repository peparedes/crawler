So, here's how it all began.&nbsp; An outline in the yard.

<A href=""http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/?action=view&current=birthdaygarden009.jpg"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Photobucket src=""http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/birthdaygarden009.jpg"" border=0></A>

<lj user=""joecub""> lent a hand digging some dirt.

And here's Davey, digging in the dirt.&nbsp; He thought it made him butch.

<A href=""http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/?action=view&current=birthdaygarden020.jpg"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Photobucket src=""http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/birthdaygarden020.jpg"" border=0></A>

And here's how it looked, with the liner in, and the arber in.&nbsp; It took awhile to figure out how to get the damn waterfall built.

<IMG alt=Photobucket src=""http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/birthdaygarden072.jpg"" border=0>

I finally decided to build it up with cement blocks.&nbsp; That worked well.

<A href=""http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/?action=view&current=birthdaygarden073.jpg"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Photobucket src=""http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/birthdaygarden073.jpg"" border=0></A>

Here's what happens when you ask <lj user=""shavedheadpenn""> to fill the pond.

<A href=""http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/?action=view&current=birthdaygarden136.jpg"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Photobucket src=""http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/birthdaygarden136.jpg"" border=0></A>

And here's the final product.&nbsp; I need to get the water cleared up, and put some plants and fish in, and it's ready to roll.

<A href=""http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/?action=view&current=birthdaygarden117.jpg"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Photobucket src=""http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/birthdaygarden117.jpg"" border=0></A>

And here's the back, and what you see from the alley.

<A href=""http://s74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/?action=view&current=birthdaygarden121.jpg"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Photobucket src=""http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i244/jstraw1/birthdaygarden121.jpg"" border=0>
</A>

And finally a side shot.&nbsp; I love the way it turned out!"

<FONT size=4>So, I traded in the Bonneville for a 2006 Dodge Stratus SXT.&nbsp; It's a nice dark blue metallic, with black interior.&nbsp; It's definitly not the Bonneville, but is a great car.&nbsp; I lowered my payment significantly, and dropped the interest rate significatanly.&nbsp; So it's a much better situation than the Bonneville, and I dropped more than 45k off the mileage.&nbsp; So, yay for new wheels :)</FONT>"

"event","This weekend there's a group of us headed up, to cheer Don Hauser up.  He's struggling with the insurance company after a fire at his house, so we decided he needed some cheering up, bear style.  Anyone wanna go for the ""I'm burned out party!""    You can check out <a href=""http://www.bearidise.com"">Bearidise</a> by clicking the link.

**UPDATE***

Here's the email I just got for the weekend, that explains the party in more detail.

OK Bears!  It's time to shine our love upon one of the great <br> Bears ... great because Don Hauser is the epitome of what Bears are <br> about ... loving, non-judgemental, unpresumptuous, and joyous in <br> life.<br> <br> &lt;&lt;&lt; The Story &gt;&gt;&gt;<br> <br> Don's house burned on October 21st and he has been staying here with <br> his cat ""Bear"" at the mansion ever since.  He was a bit blue after <br> the fire of course, so I tried to drum up a party for him, and while <br> the 3 of us did have a good time, it was a bit low-key.  It turned <br> out that I had chosen a particularly busy weekend for everyone, and <br> John Straw got in touch in December and wanted to do up the party <br> right for Don ... but the date he chose Don was going to be in <br> England ... but now, it is ALL SET UP!  This weekend we get the <br> privilege of honoring Don Hauser with what looks like a huge event, <br> and I really can't think of a more deserving recipient!<br> <br> John Straw &amp; Brad have been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes <br> marketing and food planning, and on this end I'm extending the Mardi <br> Gras decorations into this event!  We'll have pirogies in quantity <br> Saturday Night with the famous spinach salad.  John is planning on <br> having his exotic spinach dip, a cheesecake or two, and other <br> Bearish treats!<br> <br> Don knows we're having a pretty large event, but he doesn't know it <br> is for him ... the cover story is that John had a previous <br> engagement Mardi Gras weekend and wanted to do a Bearidise run!  We <br> have a lot of overnight people here, at least 7 so far, and I <br> understand that quite a few people are considering coming up Friday <br> Night, which would be grand.  I'm not sure we can manage to keep it <br> all a secret until Saturday, but hey, we'll try!<br> <br> I do appreciate your generous donations to Bearidise to help keep <br> this important place going, but please come and say hi to Don under <br> any circumstances!  He will shine back to you the love you give him, <br> and it will be a truly wonderful experience for us all.<br> <br> On Saturday Night, I will have a computerized slide show in the <br> media room showing a bit of the history of Don and his relationship <br> to the club over the years, and I'll be presenting him with a <br> special gift after a video clip of s similar situation years ago!<br> <br> So do, please, come out this weekend, the 8th-10th, and share with <br> the Bear who has shared so much with us all, these many years ... <br> Don Hauser."

"event","So, can anyone guess what I do before a party?&nbsp; It doesn't involve getting ready for the party, and actually takes a lot of time away from getting ready for it.&nbsp; 

Last night, we did our 2nd annual open house for our coworkers.&nbsp; Thank heavens I got some last minute help, since I didn't start getting ready for the party till noon.&nbsp; Turned out fantastic and everyone had a good time.&nbsp; Made some awesome food, and had a good time visiting with coworkers outside of work.&nbsp; 

Today's been a lazy day.&nbsp; Going to Coffee with the Bears at 4.&nbsp; Figuring out what to whip up for dinner tonight.&nbsp; That's about it.

How was your weekend?"

Yay!&nbsp; That's cut an hour off the trip from what it used to be.&nbsp; I think once I-99 is done, that's easily going to take a good 45 mins off the trip. 

Not a lot going on, other than that.&nbsp; Tomorrow's work, Weight Watchers (if I've only gained 2lbs or less, I'm happy), Thursday will be wings, and then the weekend will be prep for the New Year's Eve party.&nbsp; Found our first ornament casualty when we got home.&nbsp; Apparently Lucy and Rowan knocked one off the tree in the den.&nbsp; At least it wasn't one of the expensive ones.&nbsp; 

Ok, time for bed!</EM></FONT></P>"

"event","He was thinking the same thing I was last night!

""Relationships suck. Period. There is no perfect relationship. If someone says they have one, they're lying. Every relationship has ups and downs. Most have more downs than ups, but it's the height of the ups that counters the downs. This is why when people first start dating, they don't notice those little things that drive them nuts. Because they just don't compare overall. Yet ask anyone who has a 10+ year relationship about what annoys each other and they'll start a list a mile long.

And when I say relationships i am covering ALL relationships, not just the sex ones. Friendships are a relationship after all. And no, the world is not out to get you. People may avoid you though if you continue to tell everyone that so and so just hates you. Or that those ""A-listers"" dislike you. There's no A-list. It's YOUR inadequacies projected onto other people. If you are shy about approaching someone, be honest with yourself, but don't blame them because THEY are being mean and don't like you. If you sit alone in a dark bar and don't talk to anyone, why do you wonder why people think you are that creepy guy in the corner. At the same time, if you are constantly getting wasted and groping every guy in sight... you're the creepy gropey guy. Find a GOOD middle-ground.""

Saturday we're doing some more work on the backyard and patio (shhhhh, <lj user=""scottcub""> doesn't know yet) and no plans Saturday evening.

Sunday,  <lj user=""pennbear""> and Paul are hosting what is probably going to be the last pool party/potluck of the year.  If you've got nothing to do, swing by! Let me know if you need more info.

Monday, that's still up in the air as well. Any suggestions?

Today is sucking, more changes to what we do.  And they aren't good changes. 

Happy Thursday!"

That'll help make up for the time I missed this week.   <lj user=""scottcub"">, <lj user=""shavedheadpenn"">, and <lj user=""joecub""> are going to finish up the sidewalk tomorrow. It looks like I'll be making an unexpected trip to  Punkin Ridge.  My grandmother called me awhile ago, and informed me that my grandfather is in the hospital. So I'm going up there at some point tomorrow.  For now he seems to be fine, but I'm not entirely sure what's going on. 

I'm off to bed for now.  I'm beat!"

"event","<P><FONT size=4>The past couple weeks have been pretty hectic.&nbsp; Last week I finally figured out I had an infection in my eyelid, which is why my eye has been bothering me for weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a visit to my dr, and then to an opthamologist, I was given an anitbiotic that cleared it up in a couple days.&nbsp; 

Friday, I ripped down the wood covering over the patio, and the old insulation. I found 2 HUGE dormant wasp nests.&nbsp; Nasty!&nbsp; By Saturday, I was feeling really worn out, and run down.&nbsp; Sunday I was even weaker.&nbsp; By Monday, I barely could get out of bed.&nbsp; I called my Dr, and did as she told me to do.&nbsp; I wasn't much better today, so I went into the office. I apparently have some sort of viral infection as a result of the dust and dirt I inhaled from the insulation.&nbsp; It also could be from the large wasp nests. 

So that's what's been going on.&nbsp; I was able to celebrate, at least a little bit with the old men <lj user=""cubbybear48"">&nbsp;and <lj user=""bigdaddy5"">.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great parties for both of them.&nbsp;

A ~ I was chasing the Shar pei from a couple sites down through the woods, and I tripped on a root and fell down.

Q&nbsp;~&nbsp; <lj user=""collegebearny"">, why are your knees muddy?&nbsp; 

A ~ Is&nbsp;your name Mike?&nbsp; You look like a long lost friend of mine from high school, he was such a nice guy. 

Q ~ What did a drunk Stan say to some random&nbsp;boy at the bonfire?

A ~&nbsp; You've ruined paradise for me! I'm going home today.

Q ~ Do you know what you've done to me this weekend?

A ~ Oh, that's just <lj user=""joecub"">&nbsp;sleeping in a chair.

Q ~ What's the big pink blob?&nbsp; 

So, I know, I'm late. I've been very busy.&nbsp; We had a great time overall. I'm happy to report that <lj user=""artbearny"">&nbsp;didn't have bladder control issues, and didn't pee his pants.&nbsp; I did find out I'm far too fat and out of shape to climb up and down hills.&nbsp; The weather was perfect, warm during the day, and cold at night.&nbsp; We met some great new folks, and got to see the beloved Connecticut bitches.&nbsp; We also figured out just how much shit can be packed into the Sonata, and still have backseat passengers. <lj user=""joecub"">&nbsp;ended up spending the night, and riding home with us Sunday.

I'll do another update shortly.

I've been slack at updating lately.&nbsp; I'm going to look back in a few years, and think I was actually busy doing something useful!&nbsp; The reality is that I'm not. haha. Work sucks, and I hate what I do more and more every day. I've applied for a couple other positions, but haven't gotten any where with them.&nbsp; They have just hired like 12 new people, I'm waiting to see if that helps the situation or not.&nbsp; I hate the thought of interviewing for a new job, and starting all over again. 

We've been layin pretty low lately, and not running as much.&nbsp; We took <lj user=""scottcub"">'s new car on it's first big trip this past Sunday.&nbsp; We went up to Punkin Ridge for the day.&nbsp; It was a nice trip out, but rained the entire way back.&nbsp; Gram and Pap's house looks odd now.&nbsp; They had to thave the dormer on the front of the house removed, since it kept leaking.&nbsp; I also checked out the new addition Joe put on his garage. How's that for excitement!

I've also been doing fairly well on my Ebay sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do still have a lot of junk that hasn't sold, but it's slowly selling on my store.&nbsp; I enjoy hitting the flea markets, thrift stores etc lookin for new merchandise to sell.&nbsp; I've found some great stuff, that's sold quickly.&nbsp; 

I dropped off the Bonneville last night at Faulkner's.&nbsp; They hadn't fixed the seat after my accident back in April.&nbsp; So they gave me a free loaner car, and are supposed to fix it today.&nbsp; I haven't heard from them yet.&nbsp; It best be fixed, otherwise it'll get ugly. ha!

We've not done much to the house lately either.&nbsp; We need to get the patio torn out and the new one installed. That's the big project for the year.&nbsp; Perhaps we can get that started tonight.

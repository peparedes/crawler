"event","I got a puppy! Not like I really needed one or anything, but it's mainly for Todd. He's been wanting a lab puppy for next year at their house in Lexington. So, I went to Utica yesterday and got this 7 week old lab puppy for free. It's supposed to be a black lab, but it looks more chocolate. She's got a fun personality and I took her to the Pet Food Center yesterday to get her a leash and some puppy food. After I got home, I gave her a bath and played with her a little. I hated leaving her at home all day in her cage because she wasn't happy at all about being locked up. Last night, I had to have Peanuts sleep with her because she was afraid of being in there alone. But, I'll have her all summer long, so I'm not complaining. I LOVE puppies! Sadie is uber-excited and can't leave her alone. Todd and his roommates named her Sheba Lynn. Sheba because it was the name of his lab that he used to have when he lived with his Mom and Dad and Lynn because it was his Mom's middle name. I thought it was a sweet name for the dog. Tomorrow, I think I'm going to take her to the park and walk her around. Kaytee's wanting to go see In The Land of Women, which is totally fine with me because Adam Brody is hottttt. Grrr.

:)))

I have to work tonight, which sucks, but I'm complaining because I'm getting more hours. I just have a bunch of homework to do tonight and I don't want to be staying up really late at night. Oh well. I'll be playing with the puppy again tonight. But I'm gonna jam. Peace, dawgssss."

"event","Now that school is getting closer to its end, I'm noticing that people are really annoying me. There are a specific few that aren't, but the ones that are - I'm wanting to kick in the throat. CATS testing starts next Monday and our IB Art class just found out that we're being critiqued on Monday instead of Friday. I pretty much have everything done, but it's still really stressful. My wisdom teeth are KIllING me lately, and I'm supposed to get them taken out in June, but it most definitley can't wait until then. I think I might've already said that though. Anyways. Sheena's homecoming is on the 21st, but I'm working, which sucks real bad. I'd like to hang out with her but that's completely impossible. I have to go to work today, tomorrow, and Saturday. I'm not complaining because that's money, but I just don't enjoy my job anymore. I got a raise, but it pisses me off that I've been working there for over 2 years, and a girl that has been working there for almost ONE year is getting paid more than me. I'm thinking it's because she's older, but it's completely unfair and I hate it. I had an interview at Family Christian Bookstore, but I never called the woman back and I don't want to take a chance anymore at getting another job. I pretty much have it made at my current job because she always lets me off when I need to, no matter how short the time notice. I'm probably going to apply at some other places and just keep my other job. I'm needing some money really bad anyways. Gas, $900 insurance payments and whatnot is getting hard. And that insurance is just for MY car, not Mom's van. It hardcore sucks.

Dad's called a bazillion times, but I refuse to answer the phone. I don't want to talk to him! BLECK. Hancock County HS had their prom last Saturday, which I think is incredibly early, but he was working it. I'm uber excited about prom this year, but I don't even know why. None of my friends are going, minus Lauren and Savannah. And it'll be fun with them, but other than that, there really isn't nothing exciting. I just want to get dressed up and look pretty. I'm that big of a nerd.

I'm making really good grades as of now! I'm pretty proud of myself. I actually have an A in French, which hasn't happened since Freshman year. And I'm hoping that I aced (or atleast got a B) on the US History test today. I feel like I did really well. But anyways, gonna jam. Gotta make some stuff for graphic arts.

Peace, dawggggg."

"event","I'm soooooo excited for prom. Seriously.

Uhm. It's probably not even gonna be that big of a deal, but I'm uber excited. Mom and I are going to pick up Todd on the Friday before to get all his stuff since this is his last week before his classes are over. Uhmmmm. I'm in pain. Real bad. Blegfhhh.

I'm getting my wisdom teeth taken out next month. I'm supposed to get them taken out in June, but one of them is killing me, so I can't wait. I don't want to get them taken out because I like food. I'll like eating milkshakes constantly and whatnot. 

I've made a compromise with myself to stop drinking cokes, and start drinking more water. Mom found out about my smoking habits and obviously is wanting me to quit, but I told her that I'll quit on my own time. But I am trying to. It's getting bad to where it's getting difficult to breathe. That's probably not good. Anywyas, I'm trying to quit by the time school is out. But I don't know if that'll happen or not. Oh welllll. Hear about the Virgina Tech thing? Tragic. Mom told me about a thing that her professor did while she was in college in her psychology class. They were sitting in class one day, and all of a sudden, some kid busted into the classroom and yelled at the teacher, ""I HATE YOU! You never give me any good grades!"" And he shot the teacher a couple of times then ran out of the room. All the students, including Mom, just sat there and looked at their teacher who was laying on the desk. Finally, a couple of guys in the class ran up to the teacher and checked on him, and the teacher popped up and said, ""You just experienced what real shock felt like. Write down everything you can remember about the shooter."" And my Mom said that she couldn't remember anything. The guy had loaded the gun with blanks and I guess they had warned the president of the college about it and they didn't mind. I can only imagine what the students at Virgina Tech experienced. ARRGGHHHH. Did I mention that the guy who shot all the students was Asian? Psh.

"event","I just read through my sister's old livejournal that she used to have whenever we lived at the old house. It makes me wonder how she was really feeling all the time when we hung out and talked. I really, honestly miss talking to her, but she has her 33-year-old boyfriend who has a 13-year-old child and hasn't called Mom in about a week. It kinda hurts to hear Mom talk about how she hasn't heard from Sheena or how we haven't seen her in a few weeks. I guess things turned out well. But I wish she hadn't moved out when we were at the old house. But I guess things would've been different and I might not be going out with Todd or anything. I guess it still makes me mad that she just left. No warning or anything. I remember it very clearly.

It was a Saturday morning and me and Mom had just gotten home from my piano lessons. Her car was still there so we didn't figure that anything had happened. But when I looked into her room, everything was in it's place and nothing was messed up. Mom continued to go back into her bedroom to go to the bathroom but I was the only one that noticed that there was a small note and a car on the kitchen island. Being 13 years old or so, I was curious to read it and when I did, I immediatley wished I hadn't. She had left a note that said to keep the car, and that she was gone. Dad was ""working out"". God knows what he was really doing at the time, because we all know that whatever he says can or can't be true. I don't really think he cared that she was gone because of all the fights they had had. It sucked. Really. I actually felt extremely relieved when she left because I wouldn't have had to be a victim of hearing all that crap at night. The yelling and whatnot. I don't think that they knew I could hear them, but Mom was always trying to get them to be quiet or go outside or something. BLEGH. I hate families. I hate relationships. I hate Dad. All he does is put people down or criticize everything I do or compare me to my sister. I refuse to answer his phone calls anymore, and I haven't talked to him since Christmas. Mimi (His Mom) called me the other day, but I was working and didn't answer but she left some stupid voicemail saying the ringback tone I had was ""bad music"". I thought it was hilarious.

Anyways. As of now, I'm extremely unhappy. Behind on school, relationships with people are complete CRAP with the exception of some. I miss my friendships with others and I wish that I hadn't become involved with others. I wish I had a Dad that CARED and wasn't such a jerk. It sucks real bad.

BLEGH. Oh well. It happens."

"event","Uhmmm. So. Spring is hereeee! I'm uber-excited and it feels so great outside. I didn't have to work yesterday, which was great. Buttt, I ended up going to Kroger's to get some stuff and then came home and baked a cake for Jill and Alan on their new baby situation. I started at 1:00 and didn't have it finished until around 5:00 because stuff kept messing up plus cooking time and cooling time. BLEGH. Buttt, I took it down there around 5:00 and stayed until 6:00 because they were hella-busy and I helped out. Other than that, went home and did some homework and got some pizza from Hayden's for supper. Moma (My Bosssss) told me when I came back down to get the pizza that she's going to give me $15 on my next paycheck to pay for Hadley's practice trial cake. And I guess for helping out too for that hour.

I'm so incredibly ready for Spring Break to get here. I'm so tired of school and having to wake up at 6:30 in the morning and keeping up with homework. I already know that I'm working that Tuesday morning and me, Mom, Hubby, and Grandma are going to Bowling Green on Monday to see my relatives for Grandma's birthday, which is next Wednesday. Then, that Wednesday, I'm going up to Lexington to get Todd and staying until Friday to go to Keeneland (A horse-race track that is uber-uber-uber-fun.) and then coming home. Moma is totally taking advantage of me being able to work during the week again. Here lately, I had only been getting 10 hours or so, probably less. And this week, now that I can work again, I'm getting 28 hours this week. But I'm not complaining because I love working during the summer, being so busy and all. Plus, good money. But I'd like to have some kind of raise soon, but I doubt I'll be getting it. I wish that they would go on ahead and raise minimum wage or something to help me out. I owe so much money to Mom STILL and our insurance is going to be due soon and I only have like $80 saved up. My part should be around $300 or so. So, I suck real bad. Kathy paid me $75 the other day for Hadley's wedding cake. And I'm making Wes' grooms cake as well as Hadley's bridal cake too. So, I think I'm getting my plate too full, but I really enjoy baking and decorating the cakes. I think during the summer, I'm going to actually start my little cake business or something. But yeah. I'm gonna make some signs.

Peace, homie! :)))"

"event","I'm extremely tired. I didn't even go to sleep that late but I had the worst time waking up this morning. Have you ever seen the Gridiron Gang? Yeah, well. Imagine whenever that one boy is getting the crap beaten out of him by the Rock. That's what it was like this morning with my Mom and a rolled up magazine. She lost her voice because she's sick, and I guess she came in at 7:20, but I didn't hear her because she was whispering. By 7:30, she had stormed in, thrown the covers off of me, and was whacking me from head to toe with a magazine. I was sleeping in a hoodie, and so I didn't have anything covering my legs and the cold magazine plus the bad feeling of it smacking my legs wasn't exactly what I wanted to wake up to this morning. Uhmm. So yeah. I woke up at 7:30, which is usually the time I leave, so I was hustling to get ready but go to school by 8:00 because I'm awesome.

There's so much incredible drama between friends right now. Well, not really, but it just seems like people are at each other's throats. I think I'm just really irritable as of now and it's like everybody and everything is getting on my nerves. School isn't really an issue as of now, but I'm pretty lazy. I'm doing my homework and everything, but it gets me down and I get really depressed or something. It's weird. I'm just anticipating Spring Break and Summer. Pretty much the time when there is NO school. Kaytee is really wanting to go camping, but I'm not allowed to go unless Todd goes and Todd can't go unless it's the weekend, but Christy can't go on the weekend because that's when she works. Jeff already asked off work, and Kaytee took her week's pay. So, pretty much everything isn't going to work out. Atleast, not for me. So, I'm probably just gonna go up to Lexington for Spring Break and stay up there the entire week because I won't be working until the weekend and even then, Todd'll be coming back in with me on Thursday night. But I'm excited regardless.

:)))

I'm getting a Zune once I get my taxes back. I was gonna get an iPod, but iTunes would eat the space up on my computer. I guess I'd rather have a Zune, but I'm not quite for sure. I just know that once I get it, Todd's getting my iRiver because he's DYING to have an MP3 player for some reason. It's not like he doesn't have a PSP that I got him for Christmas. Pshawwww. Anyways, yeah.

It sucks. But I'm gonna research these MP3 players, yo."

I can't stand school. Initially, I was so excited about this year. Now I can't wait for it to be over. Senior year is calling my nameeeee. Our little group of friends are slowly falling apart. I've said it before and it didn't fully happen, but now, it's just. Blegh. I think it would be fun living together in college and everything, but honestly. I don't think I could do it. As of now, only 2 of my ""friends"" are annoying me and the rest, I love to death. A few arguments, but mainly just laughs. Living together however, would be a different story. That would be us hanging out 24/7, sleeping only a room away, waking up to see each other. Homework would not get done. And no matter how much I would try to keep up with my school work, it would be extremely difficult.

Here lately, I've been attempting to get all my homework done and still have some kind of a life. So far, it's working. I've been doing all my homework while waiting for Todd to get done playing basketball at Lewis Lane and/or Legion Park. It works pretty well because I don't want to watch nasty, sweaty guys play ball for 3 hours. Not a good sight. Anyways, I'm gonna jam, yo. Gonna do my Graphic Arts assignments."

So, main big news is that me and Todd are back together. Many already know, some don't. So, to clear things up. We are. Soooo. Yesterday was extremely eventful. I woke up at 1:00 PM, and that's only because Todd didn't want me sleeping all day. So, once I woke up, we went to McDonalds with Jimmie T. and then went bowling with him and Tyler R. After that, we went to the mall and saw Nick and picked me up some applications. I'm applying at Shoe Carnival, and I applied to Family Christian awhile ago, but I have to go talk to them about it soon.

Uhmmm. So. Yeah. After that, we came back home and I did some homework. Then me, Mom, and Todd went to eat Chinese and then we went to Legion Park until 10:00 because he wanted to play ball. Soooo. We decide to go driving on some country roads back near Panther Creek (Keep in mind that it's around 10:30) and the speed limits are 30-45 and there are hella curvy roads. Like, curves where when you go around them, you can't see anything else that's coming the other way. It freaked me out. I mainly just smoked and closed my eyes the entire time because I kept seeing weird things, like dogs running out in the middle of the road, but there really weren't dogs there. Creepy. Yeah.

Anyways. Todd missed the road that we were supposed to take and could've gotten home at around 10:45. No. We drove and finally got home at 11:30. We didn't necessarily get lost, just a little confused. Or atleast took the long way home. Driving was fun though, and Mom gave me money to get a full tank of gas. Free gas. Driving. Basketball. Bowling. McDonalds. New China. It was a full day of F-U-N. So, now, I have to stay after school today and take a dumb Pre-Cal test which I KNOW I'm going to fail. It sucks really bad because I have a 68 in that class. Mrs. Mann TOTALLY hates me because I've slacked off so much. I don't even know why I have. But it's been bad. So yeah. I think after I get all that done, me and Todd might be going to the Y to work out. And I need to go to the tanning bed really bad. I haven't been in awhile. I'm really wanting a McDonalds McChicken too for some reason. Yummmm."

I've got most of my homework done for tomorrow, except for reading and I'm staying home tonight, so I'll probably be doing that. I'm catching up on all my work currently because I hate falling behind, and that's what I've been doing lately. Especially in Pre-Calc. I got a DM in there yesterday for not having a homework assignment that I didn't know that wasn't turned in. Blah.

I always have to call her when I'm out, which doesn't bother me too much, but it gets to be a hassle.

I really don't enjoy going, but as long as Mom will be a little easier on me, I don't mind. Dad called me last night. Didn't answer, as usual. I'm not in the mood ever to talk to him. Also, Todd called me last night, which was weird. He apologized for being a jerk to me the last few weeks and that he was going to pay me and Mom back for our Christmas presents. He wasn't a jerk, but I feel better that he called me. He asked about school and things, nothing was mentioned about Nathan, but I figured he knows because Nick probably told him. Ah well.

Boys upset me."

"event","I had my Guitar Hero party Saturday night. It was soooo much fun. Everybody that I invited ended up showing up, except for Nick, Jennifer, and Ben. But regardless, it was really fun. We only had one PS2 hooked up, but everybody got to play. Everybody left at 1:00, but Blake stayed until 2:00 and talked to me, Mom, and Kaytee.

So. Anyways, Christy had to leave later on that night and I guess she pulled around in the yard and drove around Savannah's car. Only minutes later, she came back in to tell my Mom that she was stuck in our ditch. I'm not even kidding. This wasn't the kind of stuck where you could just push the car out of. Her front left tire was full-on in the ditch and the back right tire was off the ground. We eventually tried to push down on the back end to lift the car up, but it was still too heavy. Because we also have the greatest luck ever, or more-so Christy, a car drove by as we were pushing on the car and stopped right in the middle of the road. It was sort of creepy, until the flashing blue lights came on and a State Trooper stepped out of the car. He mainly just stood around and watched us struggle and shined his flashlight in our faces, so he basically wasn't any help. We attempted to put a board underneath the tire in the ditch, but it just ended up flinging water everywhere and making a worse mess. Finally, Samantha called her dad and had him drive out to my house with the truck to pull Christy out of the ditch. That worked, thank God. And our yard really didn't even get torn up. I'll just say that Christy had a bad night. She busted a wrong party, stubbed her toe THREE times, ran her car into our ditch, and then left her phone at my house. But I'm glad she came.

RAWR. I don't work today, so I have to go to Wal-Mart and pick up some stuff for school. I'm out of high-lighters and whatnot, and I have an appointment to get my haircut at 4:30. I totally went and hung out with Nathan last night. I'm super surprised that Mom let me, because she's not sure if she likes him or not. I think she's realized that I'll find out for myself if he's the right guy or whatever. It was cool though, we just went and hung out at his new apartment. It's uber-nice, although they haven't really moved in yet, it was still nice. Comfy couches. Pretty table, that was totally for outside use, but they won't even use it because it's for looks. Weird, right? Yeah. Anyways, I ended up being 45 minutes late for curfew, but Mom wasn't really mad. Surprised, again. I just talked to her about me and Nathan, and the party. But things went well, overall.

Ah. Life. But I'm gonna jam, yo. Time to make some badges! Yeah, I'm at schoollll...

"event","I can't ever figure out what my password is on LiveJournal. I always end up forgetting. I suck at life.

Soooo much drama is going on right now. It's crazy. It's sorta like our little group of friends is falling apart, which totally sucks, because we've all been friends since middle school, some since elementary school.

I still haven't talked to Todd since we broke up, but it doesn't really bother me. He's attempting to get with one of Brandi's friends, Heather. But, I don't really care. I know it's like a really harsh thing to say, but I don't really. I talked to Kaytee about it earlier this week, and it was totally not fair that he told me that I couldn't talk to guys for 6 months, then goes to date some girl. I'm talking with a guy, whom I've liked for quite awhile but never really got to talk to him. Hanging out is cool and everything, and he's alot of fun.

I'm having a Guitar Hero party on Saturday that I'm super-psyched about. I've invited almost 20 people now, and I'm still trying to get ahold of some. I'm really excited and everything. I'm really happy as of now, because I'm just now becoming close with all my friends. I think having a boyfriend kept me from hanging out with them like I usually did. I love muh friends, sooooo much. I went to the mall with Sheena yesterday and we bought some CDs. I bought the OK GO cd and the Hellogoodbye CD. Both of them are soooo good. I'm glad I bought them. Today, Kaytee burned me Wolfmother and Regina Spektor, I really like the Regina Spektor CD. It's really different, but I love it. But anyways, gotta jam, yo. Going to work at 4:00."

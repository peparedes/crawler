"event","I had to stop by the grocery store to pick up some steaks. I've done so well since getting off of work today. I had a salad. I had chocolate covered almonds, but I didn't go overboard. I didn't touch the popcorn in the kitchen cabinet. When I saw it, I kept looking back to it. The cabinet door was left open. I kept looking at it from the living room. I can taste it even now. But I closed the cabinet.

When I stopped by the grocery store, I bought pads. But I walked through a few aisles. I saw the lunchables. I saw cookies and crackers and chips and donuts. I saw the frozen food aisle-- the one with pizza. I stopped myself from walking further. I just turned down the closest aisle, the cookie aisle, and walked to the register.

Old habits die fucking hard.

But today, I am the winner."

"event","Today would be day one, but I guess I'm going to have to resist my current craving and start over right now. I had some chocolate covered almonds and the taste of chocolate melted on my molars. It was delicious. Then I took two huge, hurried handfuls of white cheddar popcorn. The popcorn gave me a rush. I immediately wanted to eat the whole bag. I put it up. Ugh.

Then I made two eggs with no cheese. I'm still hungry. I have a cup of coffee to drink. This is my life now."

<lj-cut text=""I have to think about this for a while."">

My problem in a nutshell-- the addicts dilemma: <i>I can't stop once I've started. And I can't stop from starting again</i>


PART ONE- foods
Any food that I can't stop eating once I start is a food that causes cravings. Those are the foods I need to eliminate. Plain chocolate, candy bars, cheese, french fries, bread, bagels, rice, gummy bears, mike & ikes, ice cream, donuts, fruit snacks, frozen meals, pizza, pizza rolls, ranch dressing, 

What is in common between these foods?
Sugar, the carb foods (bread, bagels, rice) are types of sugars. but the other ones are candies. Sugar. and Cheese. I know cheese is a problem because I eat it straight out of the bag, in hurried handfuls with my face in the fridge. 

<b>Sugar, cheese.</b> <s>chocolate</s>

PART TWO- behaviors
secret eating (secret snacks)
eating in my car
going out to pick up something then destroying the evidence
fast food
vending machines
eating to feel FULL. to feel stuffed. eating to the point of discomfort, every single time.

don't eat between meals
don't eat pre-prepared meals. don't eat fast foods, vending machine plastic wrapped foods. 
eat the meals that are planned and that take time to prepare.

I miss it, sort of, but I think I have reached the point in my life where I no longer believe in it all anymore. I guess my worldview is tainted by age. Was this supposed to happen so early? I figured it would take til my 30s at least."

"event","You have GOT to be fucking kidding me!

I had a friend repair some stuff on my car for me
he charged me 500 bucks
which is fair b/c at a real shop it would have been 800, or probably more than a 1000 bucks.

I also bought two new tires, for a total of 140 bucks. 

That's a total of 640 bucks I have spent on my car this week.

Then today, I went to the shop b/c I need an alignment (did you know a simple fucking alignment costs 70 fucking bucks! I couldn't believe it!).

But on top of that, they can't do an alignment until I get my rear shocks replaced... And when I get the shocks I also gotta get the springs. Those two things would be about 300 bucks, but then the shop wants to add a labor fee of TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS. 

So, on top of the 640 bucks I just put into this car, they wanna charge me an additional 630 dollars to do the rest. 


That puts me nearly 1300 dollars in the hole here. 





And the kicker?
I only paid 800 bucks for my car to begin with!



:( I am feeling money sad right now. I can't handle it."

"event","The song and the lyrics. I went through and changed the lyrics I found on the website, cos I think they had some parts wrong. Listen/read and let me know if you enjoy. Let me know if anyone looks at lj anymore...

I couldn't find a satisfactory video, or any recording of this song that isn't on ilike or rhapsody, so here is the rhapsody link.... enjoy! And go ahead and listen to the whole thing cos it's great :)

http://www.rhapsody.com/cee-lo/cee-lo-green-is-the-soul--explicit 


Cee-Lo Green, ""Die Trying""


See there's no way and there's no how
I could stop now, Imma die trying, Imma die trying
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep goin. Imma die tryin, Imma die tryin

Before we came being southern wasn't something to claim
That flag wasn't something to fly; it was something to blame
Smilin and chucklin and jivin I was so ashamed
They did this dirty, apparently an appropriate name
I wrote about a revolution and sung from the soul
Spoke with my spirit and mind my ambition was blind
Answering the call of god like a child obeying
Preaching the very same power they killed Martin for saying
But you can't break the mold in by holding your breath
Thought if I died for ya, that would be an honorable death
So sincere my eyes begin to swell up in tear
And it's clear my music may not do well up in here
Oh my god being a nigger must be a good payin job
With all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss
There is a time and a place for everybody's taste
But I know too much and I owe too much

See there's no way and there's no how
I could stop now, Imma die trying, Imma die trying
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep goin. Imma die tryin, Imma die tryin

So here it is, an invitation to an open book
A painful past-- my heart is still broken-- look!
I know you don't hate me; it's not assured that anyone appreciate me
See I've been having a hard time selling my albums lately
In recent news the source couldn't find any microphones to rate me
Using words like extreme and alternative to equate me
Which is true, I'm in a box with a view, but you still wanna gate me?
I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to a great me
The final cross to bear is mine it's not a cross to share
But isn't it ironic I still wanna borrow the cross to wear?
That obviously cost to wear but considerably less than the price that it costs to care
Now I have another loss to spare I doubt em sayin that I can't win
Even though I know talking intelligent just ain't in
You most likely to go broke when you 
just can't bend
So me and JJ both gon' have to pay again

See there's no way and there's no how
I could stop now, Imma die trying, Imma die trying
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep goin. Imma die tryin, Imma die tryin

Listen
People still standin in line at the World Party for some Soul Food
To get put back in that old mood
They say we like the new 'Lo
and we respect everything that you trying to do 'Lo
Do what you do but just do more that you know
It's a catch 22 and I couldn't cry
Now I'm under oath with them both and I couldn't lie
Custom says that I'm too dope and I coudln't fly
and you getting rich talkin shit so why shouldn't I?
I'm just playing but I guess that couldn't go without saying
I'm just gonan ride this evolution until they stop me where I'm stayin
But I ain't gotta lie to ya to make it sound fly to ya
I keep my feet on the ground and bring the sky to ya

See there's no way and there's no how
I could stop now, Imma die trying, Imma die trying
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep goin. Imma die tryin, Imma die tryin"

build your own television receiver
staying home can't be that bad for me
cause i'm not scared
but i'd like some extra spare time
easily earn me big money

i'm a modern girl but i fold in half so easily
when i put myself in the picture of success
i could learn world trade
or try to map the ocean

when you're dead
in hospitals and freeways
when you're dead
in resting homes and clinics
when you're dead
it must be nice to finish

and mexico can fucking wait
and all of those french films about trains
cause i'm not scared
but i'd like some extra spare time
i'm not scared
but the bills keep changing colors

when you're dead
in hospitals and freeways
when you're dead
in dress shirts and neckties
when you're dead
in apartments and on beaches
when you're dead

they say california is a recipe for a black hole
and i say i've got my best shoes on
i'm ready to go (ready to go)
ready to go
ready to go
i'm ready to go

Why do I read articles on Obama's tax returns and scroll through my itunes instead? I means, it's not like the pressure isn't on... I must be off. Just, just, just. A minimizer.

My friend Vince Binder (pronounced: bin-der, kinda like been-der but definitely not bind-er) has been missing since April 2nd. 3 fugitives that escaped from a LA jail have been linked via some sort of unmentionable physical evidence as well as a offhand comment under interrogation. I keep looking at the websites and articles to find out more. I read and re-read articles trying to understand a different word. I have not cried and for that I actually feel guilty.

I broke down in my professors office and she offered me extra time on the paper, but I still haven't got it done. Dinner in 2 hours. Alcohol after that. I have all my quotes typed up and now organized into concepts. I have made sketchy outlines. Speaking with her limited my topic, so I feel OK. I don't know why I can't start, won't start it. Everyone else already has this god forsaken paper off their plates. Why is my still sitting here, molding and polluting my air-brain waves?"

I just don't hit people over the head with it. Humans hurt humans too, not just non-human animals. And I wouldn't generalize broad scale cruelty toward animals and nature to every specific organization. Perhaps some under cover exploratory work is called for. 
I don't know why I feel like I'm being yelled at, as if I was the one torturing animals"

"event","""What I fear most, I think, is the death of the imagination. When the sky outside is merely pink, and the rooftops merely black: that photographic mind which paradoxically tells the truth, but the worthless truth, about the world. it is that synthesizing spirit, that shaping force, which prolifically sprouts and makes up its own worlds with more inventiveness than God which I desire. If I sit still and don't do anything, the world goes on beating like a slack drum, without meaning. We must be moving, working, making dreams to run toward; the poeverty of life without dreams is too horrible to imagine: it is that kind of madness which is worst: the kind with fancies and hallucinations would be a bosch-ish relief. I listen always for footsteps coming up the stairs and hate them if they are not for me. Why, why, can I not be an ascetic for a while, instead of always teetering on the edge of wanting complete solitude for work and reading, and, so much, so much, the gestures of hands and words of other human beings. Well, after this Racine paper, this Ronsard-purgatory, this Sophocles, I shall write: letters and prose and poetry, toward the end of the week; I must be stoic till then.""

These are the immediate symptoms of crack or cocaine.
These are also symptoms of a policy debater.
Euphoric- we learn a lot and get cocky and think we are going to do great.
Energetic- 5 fucking scenarios of extinction baby.
Talkative- how many words/coherent arguments can you say in 5 minutes?
Mentally allert- When you do the intellectual activity that we do at the level at which we do it, it gets you mentally allert.

The duration of cocaine's immediate euphoric effects depends upon the route of administration. The faster the absorption, the more intense the high. Also, the faster the absorption, the shorter the duration of action. The high from snorting is relatively slow in onset, and may last 15 to 30 minutes, while that from smoking may last 5 to 10 minutes

Cocaine is a powerfully addictive drug. Once having tried cocaine, an individual may have difficulty predicting or controlling the extent to which he or she will continue to use the drug. Cocaine's stimulant and addictive effects are thought to be primarily a result of its ability to inhibit the reabsorption of dopamine by nerve cells. Dopamine is released as part of the brain's reward system, and is either directly or indirectly involved in the addictive properties of every major drug of abuse.

Debate is a powerfully addictive game. Once having tried debate, an individual may have difficulty predicting or controlling the extent to which he or she will continue to debate. Debate's stimulant and addictive effects are thought to be primarily a result of its ability to inhibit the reabsorption of intellectual masterbation by nerve cells. Intellectual masterbation is released as part of the brain's reward system, and is either directly or indirectly involved in the addictive properties of policy debate.

I want to apologize, because I know you hate me and I was mean and hurt you and I'm sorry.
I wish you would say some words to me, because right now I don't even know how to apologize to you.

I admit I'm stupid. I make terrible choices. I'm manipulative, I don't care about other peoples feelings enough, and I'm dumb.
I'm sorry.
why do you wish so badly to make amends?
Because I'm still not happy.
and because I'm sorry.
you dont become happy by making others ok with your mistakes. frankly i stopped caring a long time ago

I change with the wind. I defy gravity. I am a world renowned tightrope walker, a poet laureate, ballroom dancer, deepsea fisher, scubadiver, and quite possibly the least observant person you will ever know. I have been to the moon, climbed mount everest, won a gold medal in the olympics. I can bend steel with my mind, smell colors, learn by diffusion, leap over tall buildings in a single bound, run at the speed of sound, beat god in an armwrestling contest, befriend those who dislike me. I like turtleneck shirts, caurderoy pants, toothpicks, chewing on ice, climbing trees. I am afraid of nothing...except for quicksand."

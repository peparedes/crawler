I have considered and thought about my pension/retirement plan.  I now give a shit about my stock options.  I have debated my future and it now includes more than Taco Bell and not getting hot sauce on my shorts.

"event","Hello all.  Yes, all of you who read my livejournal.  Well it has been a bit since we last talked so lets do an obligatory recap.  Life has been ok at home......its still a sentence to be in my parents house but I have been having Taco Bell often :)  For me, who is not a big writer it is hard for me to keep this thing updated.  Last night was New Year's (Happy New Year to all -- hope it was safe) and I went out with Chandra and her gang of miscreants.  We started off at an Indian restaurant (joy :( ), then to the Tunnel Bar.  While they had an amazing selection of rare alcohols (Remy Martin anyone?), the place was smoke filled.  Seriously, I think I inhaled 30 packs of cigarettes just by being there.  The other three in our group got cigars (gross) but yours truely got some Couvosier (sp?).  If you watch insane amounts of SNL, you will remember my man The Ladies Man and his obsession with this liquor, so I decided to give it a go.  10 bucks later (expensive place) I see why he enjoys it.  We then went to Brian's favorite place on earth (:-p) Pal Joey's, so Chandra could get drunk.  We then carted her ass back to her house to watch the ball drop.  A pretty normal night.  Ahh...cant finish this now.  Maybe in the morning.....too many people on IM :-p  ta!"

"event","Its not work time so I guess I will update this thing since I haven't in months.  I wont even bother trying to recap the last 6 or so months, so lets start with today.  Its two days before X-Mas (Christ pulled sponsorship of this capitalistic fiasco 3 years ago) and I am both bored and tired at the same time.  How you might ask?  I am home yet again and without anything to do till at least the new year, I am forced to either watch daytime TV or go to the mall.  Scratch that.  I am almost forced to go to a mall every day to let my  bargain hunting mother scrounge around for crap that will most likely end up in a box in the attic taking up space.  A typical find she says, ""I saw this mug (fluorescent pink with stripes of blue mind you) on sale for 25 cents...it was marked down from 4 dollars so its a bargain"".  YOU WONDER WHY IT'S ON SALE!  I wouldn't let my dog drink out of it and I have LOW standards.  She also has this fun habit of buying gifts for people years in advance.  My aunt Helen?  Her birthday through Christmas presents for NEXT year are already bought.  Its honestly criminal how much this woman spends on bargain basement fecal material, as she will spend 3 dollars on things that no one in their right mind would pay 10 cents on.  Back to the original topic at hand (made you look up to remember).  I am bored as crap and I have nothing to do.  Luckily I have my weeknight planned out until next Monday (sweet) and Dad will be hone to do the caregiver duties, so it wont be a terrible week.  Has anyone ever noticed how may fat women there are on daytime TV?   Most of these women are either pounding down the Nestles Crunch bars or the hamburgers, and then are seen begging the host to help them lose weight.  Here's an idea!  PUT THE TWINKIE DOWN!  It will do us all a favor (you will be able walk again and I wont have to vomit every time I see you).  Before you all get our your torches and run to my house to burn me, I am not talking about 5 pounds here and there.  These people are houses!  The absolute worst of these juggernauts of fat are the ones who think they look good and strip on Jerry Springer.  No matter what your views are on capital punishment and animal cruelty, these people should be put to death promptly and summarily.  Even Willy (RIP) calls these people whales.  All right, rant over for now. I swear it will be soon I write again.  Promise."

"event","What's going on my non-interested public?  I am sorry for the lack of a real update but I have been busy actually enjoying Boston.  I'll probably update more when I head home to Holyoke.  Just to catch you up to speed if you have actually gotten to speak with me lately, Chandra just came up to visit for the weekend.  We had a great time even though it poured all over Chandra, myself and Colleen.  We headed to the North End, i.e. Little Italy of Boston, for some chow.  As many of you know I love Italian so it was a bit of heaven.  The prices were ludicrous, or normal if you aren't a college student.   We ate at Cibo, which was a place that didn't sound too expensive.  I had the Chicken Gimmela (sp?) which was some sort of licorice shaped pasta with chicken and some sort of salted meat (insert meat joke here).  It was really good except it was way salty so  you could only get so much down without needing something to desalinate.  Wine was too expensive so I ate what I could.  Then our party moved to Boston Common which sadly was the first time I had seen it since I got here.  Is it not sad that I have been here for a month and not gone there???  You can only blame it on the weather for so long...  Colleen and I shared a really nice moment when sitting near the duck pond.  The ducks came walking almost out of nowhere in a line as if plucked from Make Way for Ducklings.  It was amazing...if you are in Boston and have someone special, get your ass there.  Its free too, as if you didn't know that.  Then it started to rain a lot so we only got to look at the Charles river and headed back to fall asleep watching Family Guy.  BTW if you are one of those asshole bike riders who actually thinks there are lanes on bike trails at 10 at night, come here so I can beat you with a tire iron. Seriously, we got bitched out by an asshole (way to overuse asshole) who seemed to think we were punk kids because we didn't know the rules of the late night bike path.  He made Colleen cry too and that my friends is not cool. 

So that leads us to today (collect your winnings if you stated that I wasn't going to start the lab till day of...) Rain killed today.  Chandra and I slept till noon where we groggily got taco bell and watched Family Guy some more.  At like 5 we dropped her off and then Colleen and I played Life (yeah remember that game???) until we got food from the Wrap at like 9. Getting delivery from them is expensive but well worth it.  And yes I had cheap Mexican twice in one day.  Sue me.  I got home like an hour ago, but am still wicked tired.  I think I will hit you all in the morning.  I will start my lab.  I swear!!!!!!"

Don't get me wrong, I'd much rather watch tv in my boxers laughing at how retarded game show people look, but these are the same people who whine every day about how hard the labs are.  Thanks for giving me the night off but seriously suck it up.

On other news, I finally get to go to the supermarket today to actually get some food.  It wil be good to have something edible that is non Code Red.  I am more excited to try out that new fangled thing for my armpits they call deoderant or something of the sort.  :D

Since this is a short post, ill end with some minor shit.  I love summer.  Nothing is better than showing off your sexy legs and not freezing your ass off.  Now if there was only something for the fat people who insist on wearing tube tops.  I like my rolls in a basket, thanks.

Stepping aside from the first paragraph or what I call the Laugh Zone, I am currently procrastinating my stupid Biochem shit.  I want to go outside.  It's 80 degrees out and it's a wonderful day but instead I have to make table of data just to show that shit interferes with other shit.  Priceless huh?  Moving to other stuff, today is the first day in about two weeks I haven't felt horribly sick.  I still feel horribly tired and apathetic but what else is new?  My pit here is disgusting as there are empty soda cans all around with half eaten pretzel bags flung around like a twister went through the place.  At least it doesn't smell (badly and as of right now).  I need a shower and I don't feel like getting off my ass to take one.  The bathroom here is 7 feet from here with all of my crap in the actual bathroom but ehh.  Can't be bothered.  My bed looks so warm. Slllllleeeeeeppppp."

Why the hell did I take that lab portion?  It is such a waste of time.  The lab writeups are more of a bitch than the actual lab (I need to write 10 pages to say, ""he he the shit interfered he he"" and its a fucking summer class!!!  Got a few new albums (Mp3 and not) so its good to listen to a few new tunes.  Who knew naughty by nature put out a greatest hits album?  HEY! HO! HEY! HO!

It's no Holy Cross and it's sad to see people bitch about how they are failing when the tests are so fucking easy.  It's really sad.  One of the girls said when I told her we don't do some type of experiment, ""I would hate to have someone who goes to Holy Cross next to me in industry"".  Not only is this bi-atch the most annoying person I have worked with minus that kid in Physics but if she finds this class hard (she has to repeat this class a bunch of times) I wouldnt want anyone from BU.  I want out of this place.  If it wasnt for my non-BU activities, I'd go crazy.

Bleh.  I've got nothing to do.  It feels like i have absolutely to do and there is nothing cool to do around here.  All the cool stuff there is to do here has been done and done until it become boring.  Either that or its expensive and Im broke.  Maybe I should just sleep all day everyday until i go back or someone wants to do something.   In a way I want to go back to college just to have something to do.  Sure Id like to have a few extra hours once and a while but this is extreme.  I enjoy the nights usually but sitting home with my mom all day and looking after her is mind numbing.  

On a good note my GPA is probably going up!  Yeah for me :)  I pulled a B- in physics and a C in Pchem.  Nice grades for someone who thought they were going to fail these classes huh??  Whooo!

Ive been home 4 days (one of which being Christmas) and am already bored of a majority of the things here.  Sure there are a few people here who make it fun to be here but if i could shove them in the car with me id be sooo gone.  

Today I needed to do some shopping at our wonderful mall.  Full of lines, pumped in muzak, and teenage girls whose I.Q. matches my shoe size.  Yah huh.  It did allow me to finally pick up my roommates awesome swag and look at some new DVDs out so it wasnt a total waste.  I do have to say that it should be law that U2 should be piped though all stores and just played all the time.  I'd never leave the store.  Sure I love other bands but there is just something about looking at new South Park releases and listening to ""Whose going to ride your Wild Horses"" that soothes the soul.  I got out of the mall as quick as I could (ie they started to play Eminem....ill go lose myself somewhere else thanks).

Tonight was really really boring.  I called a bunch of people and they were all busy and crap.  Damn.  I was forced out of sheer boredom to watch must see tv.  I have no cable and ABC has the dinosaur show on.  Gimme a break, was i going play Monopoly again (see yesterday)?  Anyway I now know that the sitcom is a dead art and the idea that 7 talentless actors can get paid more per episode than I will make in all my life is staggering.  God doesnt anyone say hey this sucks lets bring back Alf?  They cancelled TV funhouse and they keep this shit?  Wow.  And they won an emmy for this.  I feel like videotaping my crap and sending it to NBC.   Trust me it will get more laughs then the 7 White people.  If you are looking for a fun game to play and you are forced to watch this show count the amount of minorities that show up during the show.  It should equal the amount of laughs.  BTW where do they get audiences for this crap?  Do they breed these laughbots for sitcoms or something???

Yeah getting my butt up at 7 AM to get ready for a 10:30 mass (god i love living at home during break....) really sucked but it had its good moments.  One of the better things that happened was MTV (no seriously MTV...go figure huh) telling me that Phish is releasing live shows over the internet.  Not only is this such a cool idea, they are letting you download a whole concert (their last one before going on hiatus nonetheless) FREE.

"event","Merry Christmas all.

Odds are the first thing nowadays anyone thinks about on Christmas is the stupid gift giving.  Lemme just describe how horrible this holiday has become.

    A week ago I had to go shopping for gifts for the family.  Not only did I have to actually pay ten bucks out of my own squelched funds to actually go to a mall, but I had to spend hours on end trying to find the ""perfect"" gift.  Doesnt this strike you as pointless?  I spend hours looking for some crappy overcommercialized ""buy me"" gift instead of something they would like or need just to satisfy some tradition rooted in capitalism.  Buy this and they will love you.  Screw that!  Buying a sweedish foot massage will not bring you closer to your family or make your life infinitely better.  Its a stupid piece of plastic that is being shoved down your thoat for nine ninety five!   Why dont we all say, ""hey lets go out and buy you something you want and spend a day"".  No more of this ""guess what you want"" shit that drives people to buy a Ron Popiel Whirladoodle at closing time on X-mas eve.  We should actually take time to BE with these people instead of thinking that a yearly visit with a expensive doodad will make up for the lost time.  Hell you could find out what these people like instead of assuming that he enjoys Pat Benetar records.

Another annoying aspect of this ""jolly"" holiday is the fact that these kids have become the most whiny ass punks since Good Charlotte.  All they do is moan and piss if for once second you believe you can not buy them some 50 dollar super game that will end up unplayed a week from now.  For example I attended a party at my girlfriends house filled with little kids.  Not only did every little kid walk out with more merchandise then the entire contents of my dorm room, they whined and complained about it!  Shit I was happy if my parent got me 1 game or 1 CD and I to this day feel spoiled getting that.  

So to sum it all up and not to sound religious (one of my next topics I assure you), where the fuck is Jesus in this whole holiday? Isnt this CHRIST-mas not MALL-iday?  No one cares that the guy strived to help the poor and give people hope and freedom, just the lame gift giving which has become forefront to the original intent of the occasion.  Speaking of the party, people left immediately following the gift openings.  No mingling.  No seeing how family is.  Just give me the goddamn gift and Ill be off.  I dont give a fuck how you are doing or what is happening, just hand over the goods and noone gets hurt.  Whatever happened to the real Christmas where it wasn't about the gifts or the Santa Claus statue (which evidently is just a marketing tool of Coca-Cola), but being with family and celebrating just life in general.  No more Playstation 2 games but actual stories of how people are and where they are doing.  

Eh maybe Im too old and jaded for this holiday anymore.  Its late.  Have to get up in the morning.  Talk to you soon.

I totally ripped this idea off a way more interesting person than me (Louie Falcetti) and I highly doubt mine will have any of the sort of actual good content that he has.  Fuck, Ill be surprised if anyone actually reads this crap.  I have no idea what to put here.  As you can see by my pointless moniker, I am a chem major therefore the odds of seeing some actual good poetry will be about as low as Michael Jackson's latest CD sales. I have really no intersting new ideas to show the world; nothing exciting or groundbreaking.  If you are looking for something coherant either, you'd better go read some Shakespear or Stephen King.  This shit wont even be spell checked.  Its basically a place where im going to let out some shit thats been bothering me, or somthing I have to just put onto some sort of medium before I go comatose.

Alright now to what actaully might be here.  Basically it will be the log of what the hell I am doing, who im hanging out with and things of that nature.  A friendly, funny IM might pop up here or something amusing to make you laugh.  Maybe I have some new pictures or shit about my life I want to put somewhere to look at instead of just letting it go to waste.  Hell maybe Ill put some poetic stuff so you can encourage me to go back to chemistry.  Even a usual rant about the world will be there (probably my first entry after this).  

Thats it for what you can expect (or not) and welcome to the show.

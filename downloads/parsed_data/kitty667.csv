then courtney woke me up asking if i wanted to go home and i told i was fine any way after that. they droped me off and me my dad and my sis went to breakfast and then we went to go see the baby. then after that we went to the movie store rented grind and then we went to target. we watched grind and went to go return it to rented jaws!
then we started to watch it but the power went out bc of my grandma's tree so they cam e to fix it and now i'm goin to bed

"event","<br />Just caught up with the manga endings of xxxholic, Kobato, and nabari no ou.<br /><br />All tragic endings, except Kobato ofcourse!<br />The ending for nabari no ou was a lot better though, sad as it is,&nbsp;I didn't expect Kamatani-sensei to bring Yoite back from the dead&nbsp;at all cos that would defeat the whole purpose of the theme in the manga, but I thought to give a glimpse of Yoite and him entering his own personal heaven was a nice touch, and&nbsp;was definitely&nbsp;closure for me. Thats exactly the ending I was hoping for, for Miharu to regain his&nbsp;erased&nbsp;memories of Yoite. The colour illustrations were beautiful (see below for the scans, sorry i could only find them in Spanish):<br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 502px; height: 921px;"" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/25.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 566px; height: 1038px;"" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/27.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img width=""665"" height=""985"" alt="""" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/28.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/29.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 869px; height: 728px;"" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/30.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/31.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/32.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/33.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/34.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 676px; height: 752px;"" src=""http://img3.submanga.com/pages/111/111460f39/37.jpg"" /><br /><br />(All Scans thanks to submanga.com)<br /><br />BUT...BUT!!! i can't say the same for xxxholic's ending...... that was just....too cruel, CLAMP, too cruel!!! Such an abrupt ending, kinda like a cliffhanger, cos we still don't know anything about the mysterious&nbsp;'egg'. I know a lot of DouWata fans (including me) will be disappointed, but&nbsp;if you watch the end of xxxholic rou adayume OVA, the song at the end, called 'Gomen&nbsp;ne' (which translates to : 'I'm sorry') &nbsp;made me forgive Clamp. <br />And I thought the ending song summed up exactly what Watanuki failed to express to Doumeki (in my opinion).<br /><br />Ah, all good series must come to an end, but I still feel so sad...-__-<br /><br />The only news that perked me up was the announcement by CLAMP that they were going to&nbsp;re-start their Gohou Drug (aka Legal Drug) manga&nbsp;which was on&nbsp;a really long hiatus (not as long as X/1999 though).<br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","Uni is finally over! the holidays are among us! so glad! those busy&nbsp;8 weeks of clinicals were extremely educational but also pretty&nbsp;tough, so im glad this rotation is over. My next rotation will be 'Surgery' which should hopefully be a lot&nbsp;more fun&nbsp;and less intense than ' general medicine'. <br /><br />ahh, whats wrong with me??? I should be delighted and over-the-moon about the 'snow' but I'm not. Its the exact opposite actually, I find snow soo disruptive to my travel plans and it just makes you wanna be a couch-potato and sit at home next to the radiator the whole time, trying not&nbsp;to freeze to death,&nbsp;and makes you&nbsp;not do any work, which is&nbsp;sooo&nbsp;NOT me. Tis' a sign of me getting old... <br /><br />Just watched the movie, 'Tron' on IMAX 3D. The 1st half of the movie was brilliant and really captivating, with all the nice graphics and brief yet cool action scenes.&nbsp;But then, as soon as they open their mouths and start talking about what Earth's like, the story behind Clue,&nbsp;and all those boring mundane stuff blah blah blah......, my mind had&nbsp;completely switched&nbsp;off, and it just went completely downhill from there. I was actually dying for the movie to end at that point&nbsp;cos it got so boring.&nbsp;So all style but no substance. Don't get me wrong though, it was totally worth watching it in IMAX and the 3D actually worked in this film to enhance the visuals, and gave you a good&nbsp;sci-fi experience, but it lacked an element of uniqueness and I felt that they could have been more ambitious with the story. Not to mention the fact that the ending was soo unsatisfactory and uber cheesy.&nbsp;If I were to rate it, it&nbsp;would be a&nbsp;7/10, saved by the amazing visuals and because I absolutely loved whoever played 'Tron'. <br /><br />Really like this trailer for the anime movie, 'Buddha': And because they used a song by 'X Japan' :D<br /><a href=""http://wwws.warnerbros.co.jp/buddha/"">http://wwws.warnerbros.co.jp/buddha/</a><br />"

"event","Ah, this lovely holy month of Ramadan is slowly coming to an end. Wish&nbsp;it could have lasted longer, but&nbsp;it was fun while it lasted.&nbsp;;) 
Yesterday,&nbsp;before sehri, my&nbsp;brother was constantly&nbsp;on his laptop, watching his shows, listening to music, reading reviews. I got annoyed.&nbsp;So when I finally asked his permission to borrow the laptop to watch one of my dramas (as I haven't watched anything since coming to Karachi), he naturally declined and taunted me. But then I thought to myself, why waste my energy harbouring&nbsp;anger and&nbsp;useless animosities. So I decided to read the Q'uran&nbsp;with english translation until Sehri. Ahh, it was so refreshing and peaceful, much better than devouring on materialistic stuff and being oblivious to the suffering thats going on here (im referring to my brother).&nbsp; 

Then today, I went to&nbsp;the local Masjid near my&nbsp;Dadi's house and prayed the whole Tarawi. It&nbsp;felt good.&nbsp; 
Eid is gonna be&nbsp;awesome, and then&nbsp;all&nbsp;my relatives will go for a picnic at the beach!!! Im totally pumped! Can't wait! :D :D :D&nbsp;"

Even though it&rsquo;s a thought-provoking film, his movies always seem to drop a few secret clues to solve the mystery, so I feel he incorporated the same concept and ideology here as well.<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small""><u><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000"">***SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Don't read any further&nbsp;if you don't want to be spoiled! You have been warned! ***</span></strong></u></span><span style=""font-size: larger""><u><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000""><br /></span></strong></u></span><br />Although the notion of waking up from dreams, and distinguishing reality from dreams is not a unique one, and has been attempted in several movies, animes, mangas, etc., this was nevertheless an interesting take on an old concept. Furthermore, what makes this different is that he planted a novel little twist here, the fact that if you &lsquo;kill&rsquo; yourself in the dream, you &lsquo;wake up&rsquo;. This is in contrast to previous media that has played with dreams, whereby if you &lsquo;die&rsquo; in the dream sequence, you die in reality as well. I thought the way how he showed the subconscious&nbsp;creating mental defences against dream intruders was a fresh thought, but I realised that this was already &nbsp;in &lsquo;Yugioh&rsquo;, my favourite manga/anime, in which Yami Bakura and Shadi uses the Millenium key to invade people&rsquo;s minds. And Yami Yugi&rsquo;s mind projects as a maze with trap doors designed to keep intruders out from accessing valuable information, which Is a similar concept established in this movie. &nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">The music definitely kept you awake, and maintained that adrenaline rush and excitement to keep the suspense going. But there was something amiss. Why were the dreamscapes so clean, perfect, devoid of wacky things expected in dreams, and so &lsquo;identical&rsquo; to &lsquo;reality&rsquo;? That, I found hard to believe! Surely, dreams should be more messed up, or mixed with unusual, bizarre ideas, or desires, and none of that was conveyed here. This was either ignored or not tapped into, and this was probably&nbsp;my main&nbsp;criticism of the film.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">Nolan definitely played his cards right. The complexity of the film&rsquo;s plot and the fast pace of the film, left many (myself included) in a perplexed state. Its definitely&nbsp;one that may require 2 or multiple viewings in order to unveil the deeper meaning behind the ending. It certainly is ambitious to show 3 dream sequences happening at one time simultaneously, the no. of layers in a dream (i.e. how many dreams within one big dream), and the different time-frames within each dream layer is what makes it fascinating but confusing at the same time. The slightly ambiguous ending again may invite people to fabricate their own interpretations, but I feel that since this is Nolan we&rsquo;re talking about, who did &lsquo;Memento&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pristige&rsquo;, im sure there&rsquo;s a more definite, solid and calculated answer. I, for one think that he was stuck in a &lsquo;limbo&rsquo; the whole time, never actually got out of his dream and is living his dream as reality,and that his wife, Mal, was right all along. Heck, I thought he was in a dream from the get-go, but I would need to re-watch it to confirm.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">But overall, it&rsquo;s a definite must-see film, and highly recommended! :DDDD<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

Oh and last weekend, we booked tickets to watch the 'Inception'&nbsp;movie&nbsp;on IMAX. One word: mindblowing! may post a mini review on it soon. ;D 
And then, mamoo had free tickets to a rock/pop concert which featured 2 bands and an interview with the famous and witty 'Stephen Fry'. Man, he has an opinion on everything!

I can take a breather now.....gosh this was the most tormenting term ever. too many deadlines, our poster group&nbsp;presentation, critical commentary, my own presentation, the OSCEs, portfolio write-up....it drained the life out of me, and then..the final exam...ughh, only given a week to revise, it was dreadful, the exam was SOO difficult, too many clinical questions and things we didn't cover, i think they deliberately designed it to be this difficult because it was the end of our 2nd year, to prepare us for the tough&nbsp;clincal years ahead starting in year 3. AND, not to mention, they lowered the pass rate from 50% to 49% for this exam, sounds fishy,&nbsp;probably because it was&nbsp;soo difficult, they were afraid less people would pass the required standard. (ughh, like me!!! i def. think i failed...) 

Oh well its over now, 2nd year of medicine DONE!!! yayyy!!! (unless...i have to re-sit any of them...&gt;__&lt; that would be a pain, and would put a thorn in plans to go to pakistan this August) 

I can't believe im going to go into 3rd year in october, time flies by so quickly, just 3 more years of medicine. i have a feeling it will all go by in a flash, and i before i know it, ill be graduating as a doctor! (scaryy!!!) 

current plans for summer holiday: to watch 'Inception',&nbsp;part-time&nbsp;job&nbsp;for the whole month of July in the hospital, and go to pakistan for the remainder of Ramadhan, yay! 

Hope everyone's okay!!! and Maru and Maria, congratulatons on all your achievements, im very proud of both of you!!! :DDDDD keep it up! ^__^ 

Take care minna!

P.S. something funny happened during one of my stations in the OSCEs exam: while i was doing the GALS screen examination on this patient, you're meant to report your findings to the examiner while you;re examining the patient, and i was looking at the soles of this patient's feet for any abnormal signs of weight-bearing and callosities, and i was about to say that there were NO abnormal signs (because normally, we're given normal patients, you see...), but then i saw that his feet had OBVIOUS callosities and cracks, and they were completely&nbsp;WHITEE!!! and i was hesistant to report this, cos&nbsp;i was afraid the patient might get offended,&nbsp;but then i decided to be brave and very frank about it, and said it anyway,&nbsp;LOL!!! hope i dont get marked down! &gt;__&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

<img src=""http://static.newmoonmovie.org/nmm/images/200909291853.jpg"" />

Gotta say the action sequences were pretty cool,despite the rather dull story. Better than the 1st movie, which was so terribly boring that i almost fell asleep half-way through the movie. And the books, oh god, tried really realllyyyy hard to finish the 1st chapter of the first book, but i found the writing just so unbearably flat and uninteresting, that i couldn't even get past 2 pages...-__- Still don't like Stephanie Meyer's version of pimped out vampires, with totally new additional superpowers.  A total betrayal of the average vampire-fiction, i mean i've watched Buffy, i know what vampires can normally do, and mind-reading or pre-cognitive abilities are not one of them! But overall i'd say this sequel was rather satisfying, i liked the chemistry between Jacob and Bella, and when the wolf pack transform into these humungous wolves the size of a grizzly bear. The movie was a good way to distract myself from studying, haha. 

And last week i watched 'Avatar' in 3D with my brother. 
<img src=""http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/files/2009/12/avatar11.jpg"" />

Was quite disappointing, with a generic plot, extremely predictable, typical protagonist who gets accepted into this alien race and their society and then switches sides to fight against his own race. Hmm, now what does that remind you of? How about District 9, and The Last Samurai. And the movie just felt like watching a really long CGI cutscene from a game, the world itself, 'Pandora', was like any other sci-fi game, and showed a lack of creativity, with pre-historic animals, floating mountains, and the Navi race themselves were no different than East Africans with their dreadlocks, clothes, tribal face-paint and ornaments. It didn't add anything new. Although watching it in 3D was definitely a plus point and added more depth and dimension, the glasses were such a pain to wear! cos i had to wear them over my normal glasses which was so annoying cos it kept falling and slipping off my nose...>__< Anyway, the movie was not worth the money, apart from the gorgeous visuals and CG, and the heroin's amazing voice-acting, there was really nothing that grabbed my interest. All in all, a rather forgettable movie, what a pity!:(

2 days ago, i downloaded 'Blood: The Last Vampire', cos i felt a duty, as a fan of the anime movie and the series, to see how well the adaptation was. 
<img src=""http://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/blood-the-last-vampire.jpg"" />

Apart from the horribly cheesy dialogue, and the fake looking blood, I found the action sequences really impressive. Even more impressive was how the Korean actress/model who played Saya(the main character), was able to speak in Japanese rather fluently. 

Now im thinking of downloading 'Ninja Assassin' which stars the famous Korean singer/dancer, 'Rain'! Oh yeah! its gonna be an action-filled week, hehehe *chuckles*

Hope everyone had a good Christmas, me and my mom shopped like crazy yesterday, i think the phrase 'Shop till you drop' fits the description quite well,lol. ^___^"

XDDD the only part i could do was the 'sorry, sorry' part of the song...heh ;^__^; <br /><br />And though i hate to mention it, probably the most popular of them all is <a href=""http://www.veoh.com/search/videos/q/mirotic#watch%3Dv16086502f9cpxn7Y "">'DBSK'</a>: <a href=""http://www.veoh.com/search/videos/q/mirotic#watch%3Dv16086502f9cpxn7Y "">http://www.veoh.com/search/videos/q/mirotic#watch%3Dv16086502f9cpxn7Y </a><br /><br />I just don't understand the need for them to show off their bulging muscles, uggh it makes me sick...&gt;__&lt; <br /><br />but i definitely prefer japanese songs over korean anyday! :) plus most of the korean boy bands, they&nbsp;all sound&nbsp;alike, and aren't very&nbsp;distinguishable from each&nbsp;other.&nbsp;<br /><br />gahh, still recovering from the shock of chapter 195 of xxxholic!!! my reaction was literally: WTF?! *brain bursts* I..dont...understand...WHAT...WHY??? -__-"

"event","<br />Firstly, apologies for the extremely long hiatus!!! Been very busy studying for various tests, etc. For those of you who aren't clued in, yes, i&nbsp;managed&nbsp;to find a house to live&nbsp;in. I'm currently sharing&nbsp;the&nbsp;house with 3 other female students, 2 of which do pharmacy, and one does photography.&nbsp;They're all extremely nice and friendly, and both the pharmacy girls are Iraqi&nbsp;muslims (although one of them doesn't practice Islam, is 18 years old and has a 33 year old boyfriend!!!! *shock, horror* Okay...moving swiflty along....my room is pretty good, decent-sized, more than what i was expecting (may post some pics of&nbsp;it later ;)). Each bedroom comes with&nbsp;its own little sink (which comes in handy particularly when doing 'wudhu', lol) and it was fully furnished, so i already had a wardrobe, bed, and computer table in place&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;moving in. Convenient, huh? :D We're currently sharing our neighbour's wireless internet connection (he kindly offered it to us) but we are in the process of&nbsp;acquiring our 'own'&nbsp;internet connection&nbsp;after we purchase a phone handset (and split the cost amongst the 4&nbsp;of us) The rent we have to&nbsp;pay&nbsp;is 350 pounds per month (excluding bills). <br /><br />I walk&nbsp;16 minutes everyday to get to the train station to get to uni,&nbsp;although i have recently started taking the bus as&nbsp;well. The way back home, however was, at first, a complete nightmare!!!&nbsp;&gt;____&lt;&nbsp; Have to walk up a 'treacherous' hill to get to my house (there's no way of avoiding it), cos&nbsp;my house is&nbsp;situated on a hilly area. That was SOO hard&nbsp;to get used to, but now i have totally gotten accustomed to it. (no need to do 30 min exercise everyday&nbsp;to keep yourself&nbsp;fit, i&nbsp;fulfil that requirement anyway just by walking up and down the hill, haha! XDDD)&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, enough about my house...i hope everyone is doing fine alhamdolilah and that everyone's in good health :D<br /><br />Oh yeah, my module for this term is on &quot;Neuroscience&quot;!!!!!!!! Its SOOO&nbsp;amazing!!! Ahhhh... the most interesting modules i have come across so far, very heavy and complicated but oh so interesting!!! I'm totally loving it!!! ^O^&nbsp; So today in my SSC (student selected component) session, we were&nbsp;debating quite deeply&nbsp;on whether&nbsp;there is a 'God' spot/lobe, or a neuroanatomical&nbsp;variability&nbsp;in&nbsp;the brain thats responsible for 'religion', cos the SSC i chose&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was 'fMRI brain imaging of religious experience'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we were talking about how many scientists are still troubled by the 'persistence' of religion for decades, even suggesting that religion may have some kind of 'survival advantage', as people with religion tend to be less prone to mental illnesses...? hmm.....what a strange thought....&nbsp;Our teacher then&nbsp;deviated&nbsp;completely and started asking us about how we&nbsp;percieve&nbsp;mental illness with 'possession' and the whole 'glossolalia' concept ('speaking in&nbsp;tongues')&nbsp;which is the idea that some people can speak God's words/messages from a divine above, said to be elicited when&nbsp;under an intense prayer or intimate connection to God, almost as if&nbsp;they are being possessed&nbsp;at that moment (not in control of themselves) to say&nbsp;this nonsensical, unknown&nbsp;language.&nbsp;But to us normal people, it would sound as something completely gibberish and incomprehensible. Some say it can be translated, others say it's a language out of this world. But no one really knows what brings about this bizarre phenomenon...there has been research showing certain areas of the brain becoming active during glossolalia, like increased&nbsp;'temporal lobe activity'. But yeah,&nbsp;our teacher has a&nbsp;habit&nbsp;of deviating and going off-topic a bit, but its hard not to go on a 'philosophical' tangent&nbsp;during these discussions (which is what we normally end&nbsp;up doing..hahha, lol!)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's a youtube video, if you're interested in knowing more about 'glossolalia': <a href=""http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?hl=en&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=glossolalia&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wv"">http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?hl=en&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=glossolalia&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wv</a>#<br /><br />There are 8 of us,&nbsp;with 4 of us declaring ourselves as 'religious' and&nbsp;the other 4 being 'non-religious' (I obviously was in the religious group) and basically we&nbsp;discuss loads of articles and critically evaluate these research papers (all of which involve some form of brain imaging&nbsp;perfomed&nbsp;a group of&nbsp;participants while they are having a 'religious experience' to see which areas of the brain light up and whether these&nbsp;loci of activation were different&nbsp;from non-religious people.&nbsp;('religious experience'&nbsp;ofcourse, being a very non-specific and broad term involving any&nbsp;sort of 'union' , meditation, prayer or&nbsp;spirituality with&nbsp;'God', its hard to define, really.)&nbsp;SO anyway,&nbsp;I'm gonna have&nbsp;my 'fMRI brain scan'&nbsp;done next week, for the purposes of our teacher's research!!!! SOOO&nbsp;looking&nbsp;forward to it!!! ^_______^ <br />Apparently, all we've&nbsp;been told so far, is that during the fMRI, we're going to perform a task which involves looking at a pair of words being&nbsp;displayed on a&nbsp;screen, and pressing&nbsp;a button when you see the pair of words&nbsp;'rhyme'....yeah...pretty vague description, right? O__O The&nbsp;teacher doesn't want to disclose anything more for fear of it&nbsp;influencing our thinking/actions during the brain&nbsp;scan. And how that relates&nbsp;to having a religious experience beats me!!! but it'll be fun! :DDD&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp;i hope everyone's fine and doing well.&nbsp;<br />Inshallah, i will upload&nbsp;my new bedroom pics sometime&nbsp;this week, so look foward to that!&nbsp;hehehe :)<br />Until then, take&nbsp;care everyone!!!<br /><br />Ciao!!! ^___^<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;"

The concert was totally MINDBLOWING!!!!!! O______O Gosh!!! I can't even speak.....after the concert i came out completely DEAF and my voice nearly ran out from all the screaming and squealing I did at the concert! hehehhe LOL! ( I was seriously screaming at the top of my lungs, but thankfully my&nbsp;high pitched screams would die down amongst the crowd, hehe ^___^;<br /><br />&nbsp;I cant believe I was totally 'rocking' with the music and 'headbanging'! *GASPPP* O___O * SEE! HYDE JUST BRNGS THATS OUT IN YOU! HE HAS SOME MYSTERIOUS POWERS! HE'S EVIL!*&nbsp; XDDDD&nbsp;LOL!&nbsp;<br />But its weird,&nbsp;I&nbsp;NEVER usually scream in public or go crazy but this time I SO did! I think sometimes you just get sucked up in the crowd and the songs that you lose some of those inhibitions, you forget about petty things and just get immersed in the music and....in HYDE! OH man, HYDE was just.....just....soooo unbelievably 10 TIMES MORE HANDSOME AND PRETTY IN REAL LIFE, FLESH AND BLOOD than in the pictures or videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! XDDD GAHHH!!!! HE LOOKED AT ME WITH HIS&nbsp;DARK,INTENSE STARE&nbsp;5 TIMES!!!!!! 5 TIMES!!!! *squeals and then faints* He just totally MELTS YOUR&nbsp;HEART! The songs were ALL&nbsp;AWESOME, and the DRUMS and BASS were especially LOUD, so loud that the ground was shaking! *__* <br /><br />HAHA, oh man, the bassist, Ju-ken...he was SOOOO energetic!!!! well, they were ALL energetic, but he was especially HYPER and kept the crowd's spirits high the whole time, and motivating the crowd to cheer harder and headbang and all that, he was SOO PUNK and pimping and all, hehehehehe! XDDD He dyed his hair with red highlights which looked pretty cool too and had makeup on, with blue lipstick! He was also wearing one of those&nbsp;'goaties'&nbsp;thingie like the&nbsp;bassist in the 'system of a down' wears! HAHA! &nbsp;and KAZ was awesome as well!!!! His guitar riffs were simply brilliant, and there was just SOOO much ENERGY in the whole band, you couldn't help but feed off the energy too! </span>(<span style=""font-family: Arial"">^o^)<br /><br />Oh yeah! AND i was thrown water at too by the by Hyde!!!!!! *heart melts* (you know, cos it was all hot and sweaty inside) Man! Hyde's English has improved SOOO much!!! I could understand every singly word he said! and when he said &quot;<span>don&rsquo;t worry, don&rsquo;t&rsquo; worry, I will take 'goooood' care of you&quot; in his seductive and husky voice, with an emphasis on 'good', &nbsp;I just totally squealed then, LOL!!!! XDDD well, not JUST me, everyone else did too! *justifies her actions &gt;__&lt;* <br /><br /><span>And you know how many fans say that &lsquo;Hyde makes love with the mic&rsquo;, I totally SAW that in this concert! Its like he&rsquo;s about to eat and gobble the mic when singing, ROFL! <br /></span><span>And then, after the intermission.....the UNSPEAKABLE happens! <br /><br />HYDE comes back.....SHIRTLESS!!!!! *head explodes into a million pieces* XDDD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still remember how HARD everyone screamed then, obviously all the girls and me included! (Aren't I such a fangirl at heart? XD) And he said, &quot;Its so HOT!&nbsp; It's so f***ing hot!&quot; &quot;You guys are&nbsp;feeling hot too, right? (or something&nbsp;along those&nbsp;lines, i couldn't hear properly over the fangirls' deafening screams) And then everyone screamed, &quot;YEAH!!&quot; &nbsp;and then he said&nbsp; &quot;Let's get cracking!!!&quot; And I jumped and screamed &quot;WOHOOO!&quot; LOLZ, i must be on crack or something, right? XDDD&nbsp;LOLZ! <br /><br /><br /></span></span></span><br />Surpising additions to the song list apart from their VAMPs album were the songs, 'Season's call', 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds', 'Hello', 'Jesus christ', 'Dolly', 'Countdown' and 'Midnight garden' from Hyde's solo albums. And they also did a snippet&nbsp; cover of the popular song, 'trouble' by Shampoo.<br />&nbsp;<br />The intro of 'Season's call 'was soo beautiful, but I was amazed at the chorus of 'Secret in my heart' which totally took my breath away!!!!!!!! The music was soooo... i dont know how to explain it, but coupled with his awesome godly voice totally made me go into a 'trance' cos it brought such a dark, mystical atmosphere. And at the end of the song where he screams, 'oh-oohh', that was SUCH a 'SOULFUL' experience! Man, this guy sounds good LIVE!!! I didn't think 'secret in my heart' was a particularly good song, but he totally made me change my mind! XDD<br /><br />So yeah basically I jumped SOO much with the music that I got a severely bad 'leg cramp' in the end, LOL!&nbsp; yeah, go overexcited me! &gt;__&lt;&nbsp;<br />It was SOOO WORTH it though!!! To be able to see Hyde was one of my biggest and&nbsp;wildest dreams imaginable!!! So im just over the moon and thrilled to be able to see him perform so theatrically!<br /><br />I LOVE&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;HYDEE!!!!! &hearts; <span>FOREVER AND ALWAYS!!! &lt;333333 AND&nbsp;I CAN'T&nbsp;WAIT&nbsp;FOR&nbsp; A 'L'ARC EN CIEL' CONCERT, WHICH WOULD BE&nbsp; SOOO MUCH BETTER!&nbsp; I WANT TO SEE TETSU, KEN, AND YUKI WITH YOU NEXT TIME!!!!!! heheheeheeeee! XDDDD&nbsp;</span>please make a small trip to&nbsp;London sometime, ok?!! <br /><br />Now I regret not buying their CD when I was there, cos it was $20, but i only had $20 with me. I was thinking of purchasing the VAMPS t-shirt in black first, but then there were only LARGE sized t-shirts available so i dropped that idea, and decided to buy 2 VAMPS fans, and one VAMPS bag, which is quite big and was only for $5! hehehe! so i got some nice little goodies. i also thought of buying the $3 wristbands but then my brother kicked me out, saying 'thats enough, and its closing down now, we have to go' so i couldn't. wahh! oh well, at least i brought back a few souvenirs! ^O^ <br />&nbsp;And its not fair that VAMPS&nbsp;are going to be making an appearance today at Otakon for a Q&amp;A, but the tickets are super expensive,&nbsp;$65, and i can't afford that :(<br /><br />But I will never forget this day! Even though there were no cameras allowed and we couldnt take any pictures,&nbsp;its a&nbsp;very precious memory that will stay with me my whole life :)<br /></span><br />&nbsp;</p>"

Realised I needed to catch up on the 'Naruto' manga, but oh...god....first, the SHOCKING&nbsp;revelation of Itachi (sasuke's brother) and how he in fact was *gasp*&nbsp;NOT a bad guy!!!! omg, its sooo darn tragic!!!! i don't think ive ever cried so much for&nbsp;someone who I really hated&nbsp;and&nbsp;was decieved to think he was the bad guy the WHOLE time until his death, but then later on knowing that he WASN'T!!!! &gt;__&lt; oh gosh, cannot decribe, you would&nbsp;just need to read it...&nbsp;SASUKE..you're such an IDIOT!!!! &gt;__&lt; 

BUT!! thats not even&nbsp;HALF of it!&nbsp;Then Jiraiya-sama!!!!! oh gosh another victim! and THEN.....T-T-THENN....K-K-Kakashi-senseiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OH&nbsp;MY&nbsp;GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHYYY&nbsp;OH&nbsp;WHYYYY DID&nbsp;HE&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;DIE!!!!!! NOOOOO!!!! ANYONE BUT HIM!!!! I WANT HIM BACK, YOU HEAR ME???!!!! TT_________TT (BOTH OF THEM WERE KILLED BY PAIN!!!! i mean the villain's name is 'PAIN' not the&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;'pain'...) 
&nbsp; 
i refuse to believe it, cos it was such an anticlimatic and unconventional way to&nbsp;kill off such an IMPORTANT character!!! 
&nbsp;I was shocked to the CORE and my lacrimal glands just WON'T STOP secreting tears!!! i've been&nbsp;CRYING 'non-stop' after that chapter, thinking that it can't be possible!!!! but with each chapter, its just slowly becoming clearer and it sorta starting to sink in... but luckily right now im trying to avoid thinking about it by focusing and admiring Naruto's new 'SAGE MODE' and all his fancy NEW ninja techniques!!! it's JUST AMAZING to see how much he's matured!!!!! how brilliantly tactful he's become now. 

aughh, it really seems that an 'apocalypse' has erupted now, and that the manga is nearing it's end soon.&nbsp; 
damn, this manga is&nbsp;NOT for the faint-hearted!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; 
I&nbsp;have&nbsp;an extremely 'fragile' heart,&nbsp;so I don't think I can endure any more deaths, you hear me, Kishimoto-san???!!!! 

naruto...please kill 'pain' for me (lol, how ironic) and avenge&nbsp;Kakashi-sensei's death!&nbsp;im counting on you to save me from my grief and sorrow!

Aren't they fueling&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sasuke&nbsp;fans more with such fanservice, despite the fact that he rarely&nbsp;EVER shows up in the whole season? &nbsp;<br />Especially in the opening where he steps into the lake naked.&nbsp;hmm, reminds me slightly of kikyou when she does that in the first inuyasha ending, except&nbsp;she's fully clothed, lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />Opening video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC8pk-QJuPs"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC8pk-QJuPs</a><br /><br />Ending video:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cQGHd-bzs"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_cQGHd-bzs</a><br /><br />&nbsp;They're decent songs, i guess though I prefer the ending song over the opening. <br />And just when are they going to finish all these fillers, they haven't even reached the 'madara arc' in the manga yet which they should have done 2 months ago. <br /><br />Watched the first 2 episodes of the 'remake' of 'Full Metal alchemist' anime.&nbsp;I don't quite understand&nbsp;why they had to re-do it&nbsp;from the&nbsp;very beginning&nbsp;, since the first anime&nbsp;adaptation was pretty darn good, but&nbsp;as this&nbsp;version will animate all the&nbsp;manga chapters up to the recently released&nbsp;ones,&nbsp;thats reason enough for me to&nbsp;watch it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ah, only one week left until my 3rd term of uni starts,&nbsp;and my holidays end.<br />oh well, had fun while it lasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just wish I didn't have to finish this annoying essay during my holidays.

"event","<br />I watched the movie, CHE, yesterday with my brother. We had to go all the way to London, specifically to Covent Garden to watch it as it was the only cinema showing the <strong>whole</strong> movie (as 4 hours) rather than the other&nbsp;cinemas spliiting the movie into 2 parts (which would have to be watched and paid seperately). oh wow, what a movie! not a single moment did I feel bored throughout the entire movie, its soooo engrossing and immersive, and interesting... I felt like I was watching the whole history unfolding right in front of my eyes....ah i just can't express enough my love for this movie, <em>and </em>my weird attraction and love for 'Che's' character... he is just... unbelievable...like&nbsp;a messiah or&nbsp; a saviour (or at least thats how he was portrayed in the movie). Im just so overwhelmed by&nbsp;his charm in the movie, his honesty and morality..*___* such an inspiring figure!!!&nbsp; <em>* entering dream land* </em>&nbsp;The direction and the way it was run...so perfect.. honestly its the first movie i've ever seen that I haven't been able to criticise or reveal a flaw in &gt;__&lt; (except for the fact that they possibly could have shown how the current conditions are like in Cuba in the end, but then that would be prolonging it and would take more than 4 hours, and noone wants that! ) We did have a 15 minute intermission between the 1st and 2nd part of the movie, so that made it quite tolerable, but my interest while watching the movie never died out or diffused....I&nbsp;JUST&nbsp;LOVED&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;MOVIE!!!! i think it will top my list as the best movie of 2008-2009 for now, but i will have to wait for 'Watchmen' and 'Harry Potter and the half blood prince' to verify this for sure&nbsp;(hehhe! XDDDD) <br />I can't disclose any further about the movie without giving out spoilers, so im just gonna say that I most <strong>definitely </strong>recommend this movie,&nbsp;especially if you have an interest to know&nbsp;more about Cuban history&nbsp; and how the revolution came about,&nbsp;or even if you're simply curious about how 'Che's' image has&nbsp;become so popular now as a symbolic figure, then do watch cos its reallly educational and has an element of just about everything (with a mix of comedy, comradery/friendship and morality). Ahh...his acting just won me over... its like whenever he was there on the screen, he made a stong presence, a.k.a &nbsp;'screen presence', my eyes were just fixated on him about 90% of the film...lol.<br /><br />oh gosh, i better get back to finishing my presentation on 'ascites', im slacking off here &gt;__&lt;<br />C ya guys!"

In the tradition of such films as NEW YORK STORIES, NIGHT ON EARTH, PARIS JE T&rsquo;AIME and its forthcoming sequel NEW YORK I LOVE YOU, TOKYO! addresses the timeless question of whether we shape cities, or if cities shape us &mdash; in the process revealing the rich humanity at the heart of modern urban life. <br /><br />2) <u><strong>Tokyo Sonata </strong></u>(what's with the name 'Tokyo' being commonly used in a&nbsp;movie title these days? jeez....)&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<img class=""left"" height=""193"" alt=""Tokyo Sonata Poster"" width=""134"" src=""http://images.apple.com/trailers/independent/images/tokyosonata_200901131726.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><u>Description: </u>Set in contemporary Tokyo, TOKYO SONATA is a story of an ordinary Japanese family of four..........In the hands of director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, renowned for his suspenseful films, this story probes the dark side of human nature and the social problems that confront contemporary Japan. Kurosawa&rsquo;s portrayal of the breakdown and redemption of Japan&rsquo;s &ldquo;ordinary family&rdquo; is every bit as gripping as his previous works.<br /><br /><br /><br />3) <u><strong>Che </strong></u><strong>(this looks awesome! me and my bro are thinking of watching it this sunday, but its a lengthy 4 hours long! O__O)<br /><br /><img class=""left"" height=""193"" alt=""Che Poster"" width=""134"" src=""http://images.apple.com/trailers/independent/images/che_200812121710.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong><p class=""expanded""><u>Description: </u>November 26, 1956; led by Fidel Castro (Demian Bichir), a band of 80 rebels sails to Cuba. Among these young rebels is Argentine physician, Marxist, soldier, Ernesto &ldquo;Che&rdquo; Guevara (Benicio Del Toro). Nation-less, strapped for resources and fueled only by determination, the group engages in swift, bloody battle to free the Cuban people from the corrupt dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Che and his soldiers wrestle the nation?s resources and affection from Batista?s grasp. Though considered a hero by some, Che becomes a hugely controversial figure. At the height of his fame and power, he disappears. Entering South America incognito, Che recruits another band of guerilla fighters in the harsh Bolivian jungles. They embark upon a mission to spark revolution throughout Latin America.</p><br /><br />4) <u><strong>GOOD</strong></u><br /><p class=""expanded""><img class=""left"" height=""193"" alt=""Good Poster"" width=""134"" src=""http://images.apple.com/trailers/independent/images/good_200812231520.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><u>Description: </u>GOOD, which is based on the acclaimed play by CP Taylor, stars Viggo Mortensen in an extraordinary change-of-pace role as he plays John Halder, a good, decent individual with family problems. A German literature professor in the 1930s, Halder explores his personal circumstances in a novel advocating compassionate euthanasia. When the book is unexpectedly enlisted by powerful political figures in support of government propaganda, Halder finds his career rising in an optimistic current of nationalism and prosperity. Yet with Halder&rsquo;s change in fortune, his seemingly inconsequential decisions potentially jeopardize the people in his life with devastating effects. GOOD is directed by Vicente Amorim, and also stars Jason Isaacs, Jodie Whittaker, Mark Strong and Gemma Jones.</p>So far, thats it.<br />I watched the 'Waltz with Bashir' movie today, it was being screened for FREE here in our university campus (the islamic society organised it) ----&gt; IT&nbsp;WAS&nbsp;AMAZING, TRAGIC, HEARTBREAKING&nbsp;BUT&nbsp;SOOO&nbsp;UNFORGETTABLE!!!! I really need its SOUNDTRACK!! the music was perfect, soooo worth buying. :)<br /><br />"

"event","<br />man, i had SOOO much fun dissecting the heart today from our cadaver!!! (who btw, is an old petite lady , we <em>named</em> her 'Maggie' which is short for Margaret, who died of small bowel infarct and atrial fibrillation..yumm)&nbsp;Her heart was MASSIVE! seriously, we had the biggest heart from out of all the other groups, most likely due to <em>hypertrophy</em> , and <em>atrial dilation </em>of the heart, resulting in atrial fibrillation.&nbsp;Thats the reason why&nbsp;her&nbsp;right atrium was HUGEEE!!!!!! *___* &nbsp;it was even <em>bigger</em> than the ventricles, and while I was trying to clean the right atrium, this huge blood CLOT came out!!!! O__O like the size of a fist!!! &gt;__&lt; and was rock solid, almost <em>black</em> in colour....its insane, i tell you. So i think it was because the clot/thrombus in the small bowel must have migrated and travelled up to the heart and occluded the right atrium, resulting in her death. Ahh scalpels and forceps are soo much funsies! i love playing with them around (although i heard&nbsp;that&nbsp;yesterday,&nbsp;one medical student had&nbsp;dissected her thumb because she didn't know how&nbsp;to unload the scalpel blade out, and it sliced through her thumb!!! oucchhh!!! &gt;__________&lt; cos&nbsp;these scalpels are&nbsp;dangerously SHARPPP!!!!!) &nbsp;i seriously think i might want to pursue some form of 'surgery' in the future tho, its just SOO exciting and such a rich experience! :DDDD not that ill <em>ever</em> be as good a surgeon as my dad, but hey...im <em>considering</em> it XDDD. you never know, right? ;) i dunno, i sorta feel this 'buzz' and thrill inside me in dissection sessions, and get really keen&nbsp;on&nbsp;cutting&nbsp;dead bodies up, <em>ok</em>..thats not quite the right way to phrase it, heh ;^^; d..d..don't misunderstand!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;anyway, it took us a total of 3 HOURS to finish dissecting it,as well as looking at all the coronary vessels, fine structures, and the interior part of the four chambers, but it was SOO worth it! Oh yeah, her <em>fossa ovalis </em>(foramen ovale) wasn't very visible because of all the blood clots obscuring our view, but the concept of it being there is very interesting. I was wishing our cadaver might have a 'patent' fossa ovalis, because its quite rare, but i guess it wasn't meant to be *sighhh* <br /><br />Ahhh its great when after my dissection lessons, I always somehow feel really <em>hungry</em>, whereas i thought the sight of all the muscular <em>meaty</em> bits in the cadaver would put you off meat, and decrease your apetite, but actually its quite the contary, it makes chicken even more <em>appetising</em> and <em>tasty-looking</em>. hehehee XD or maybe thats just my demented, morbid perspective? yeah, i must be weird in the head XD. <br /><br />And to end it off, how about a nice <em>juicy</em> looking picture of a random heart?<br />*WARNING,DON'T LOOK IF YOU'RE SQUEAMISH*<br /><br /><img style=""width: 214px; height: 286px"" alt="""" src=""http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h235/eternal191/heart.jpg?t=1234020513"" /><br /><br />Looks delicious, no?

"event","Yay, omg i can't believe it! our univserity is closed today due to the snow!!!! everything is CLOSED, trains and buses aren't even working! its insane, my mom won't even go to her hospital in london, seriously this is unbelievable! and the best thing is: ITS&nbsp;STILL&nbsp;SNOWING!! woohooo! but...we were meant to have 5 lectures and a test today, so i wonder when they're going to fit and reschedule all that in??!! &gt;__&lt; 
im gonna upload some pics of our snow here hopefully if i can find the USB cord to connect&nbsp;my laptop&nbsp;to my mobile :D. 
but this is amazing, cos i only ever expect snow days in america, cos it snows soooo darn heavily there, but who would expect something like that here?!! and you know, the funny thing is, its only 8 inches of snow, whereas in america, it'd be 5 times as worse, but everything would still be in functioning order, but because we're not used to this and are soo unprepared (we dont even have trucks here in Brighton to throw salt on the snow to dissolve it! ) that they had to close and shut down all services.&nbsp; even the motorways were blocked yesterday, and it took my parents 5 hours to reach home, they arrived at 2 am in the night! crazy, i tell you! 

hmm, who else has a snow day off?!!! :DDDDDD share your experience here!"

Im so happy! :DDDDDD<br /><br />I PASSED THE FIRST TERM OF MEDICINE!!! OF MEDICINE!!!!!!!!! MEDICINE, I TELL YOU!!! *___*<br /><br />ah, we've already started our 2nd term, today is my 3rd day back from Christmas holidays (which lasted a month, and Rashid mamo and Amir mamo's whole family came over to our house and stayed over for 10 days, it was a BLAST!! XD) Now my grandmother (from my dad's side) is over at our house and she's staying with us until her heart surgery/angioplasty is done, inshallah. She did have an angina attack and was taken via ambulance to the hospital on the 3rd day of her stay at our house, and was hospitalised for 2 nights but she is back now , well and stable, maashallah (thanks to my constant praying). Actually, praying realllly helps, because I prayed right before my results (that inshaallah i&nbsp;would get an A)&nbsp;were about to be released today, and then read bits of the Qur'an, so pehraps Allah lent me a helping hand and gave me the push I&nbsp;needed. In fact, Im almost certain that it was because of my praying (my faith is that strong! :D) because my friend, who is extreeemellly smart (bless her) got a B which is fantastic cos we both passed! hurrah!! BUT maybe i could <em>convince&nbsp;</em><strike>threaten</strike> her to convert to Islam if she&nbsp;desires good grades, hmm?? nah, just kiddin' LOLZ XDDDD!!!!!<br /><br />Its only going to get tougher (as if it hasn't <em>already)</em>. In fact our lecturer intimidated us yesterday by commenting &quot;if you thought the 1st term was harder, well the 2nd Term is not <em>twice</em> as harder but in fact&nbsp; <strong>5-6 times&nbsp;HARDER&quot;</strong>, and that <strong>1 in 5 people fail in this term!!!!!</strong> eeepppp!!! that sure as hell scared the bajeesus out of me! &gt;__&lt;<br /><br />Anyway, I will continue to work harder and maintain my efforts, inshallah. I wish everyone good luck and best wishes in whatever their endeavours or goals&nbsp;may be, ameen. :D<br /><br />Sorry, don't have much time, gotta do more work!<br />Bye guys! Love ya!"

"event","<p><br />Following on from my recently <em>new</em> <em>inspiration</em> for cooking, I made spaghetti today with meatballs, and threw in some other vegetables and sauce&nbsp;just to add more flavour :) Although the first ever proper meal I cooked was on my 2nd week here in uni, and that was ( drumroll.....) &quot;minted lamb koftas with sliced potatoes, green peppers, and onions on the side&quot;, ( my own unique, <em>slightly</em> modified dish) and it turned out better than I expected, considering im a total newbie! XD lol. Then the second proper dish I cooked here was one of my favourite chinese dishes, the &quot;sweet and sour chicken&quot;. yummmmm, that was sooooo good, almost similar to the restuarant style. I was quite proud of myself. I guess my flatmates sort of encourgaed me to cook, cos i couldn't simply rely on my mom's home-cooked meals, I had to be independent, and start learning it myself. It has to be said though, that I only 'cook' when im absolutely desperate and have no other food&nbsp;remaining OR when I get terribly bored of my mom' s food, hehhe :D <br />I will put up the pics of the 3 dishes, perhaps tom, at night time after I have taken the trains and arrived home (yes, im going home tom, i always tend to go home in the weekends, just sorta routine now, although its usually my dad who picks me up). so yeah, i will try! im just soooo unbelievably busy! &gt;__&lt; BUSY&nbsp;BUSY&nbsp;BUSY!!!!! roaaaarrr!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

No time to relax, Obama.&nbsp;You must work even harder now to reform the government. But seriously, this is EPIC! really revolutionary stuff! the first American BLACK&nbsp;president. ^______^&nbsp; ughh, but man, i am sooooo terribly busy, its only like our 5th week here in uni, and already we have a presentation, a second essay, reports to write up for our GP, hospital&nbsp;and family visits, &nbsp;and other assessments, due. Its insane beyond words can describe. I am struggling like crazy to juggle all the workload that's been bombarded at us. ughhhh..... &gt;___&lt; At least im having lots of fun at the same time, man, uni life is the best!!!! all the student discounts you get when you go shop for stuff or take the trains, its fantastic. But im nearly in debt now, you won't believe, I spent 92 pounds on just clothes 2 weeks ago. I&nbsp;KNOW!!! I&nbsp;MUST&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;BEEN&nbsp;MENTAL to spend that much on JUST clothes! oh well, this just means that I have to work like crazy during christmas holidays, so that I can earn the money&nbsp;I lost. Man, my accomodation and tuition fees are like really astronomical, they're mounting&nbsp;up so quickly.&nbsp;-______________-&nbsp;&nbsp;DEBT&nbsp;DEBT&nbsp;DEBT!!!!!

Oh did I mention, that this is the perfect day for celebration, cos its bonfire night today!!! soooo many ppl are gonna go the most popular and biggest event in UK, the Lewes fireworks and bonfire night! They have some neat parades and stuff as well.&nbsp;im hoping to go, but only if my flatmates are willing to come as well, hehe. :D"

I expected it to take a maximum of 2 days, unfortunately, I underestimated.....it's taking about 5 days to pack all my belongings, including all the bedding, cutlery, plates, etc. etc. Another major issue is the huge amount of handbags/trollies I have to take with me to fit all this stuff in.

Although its a verryyy short demo, if you ask me.&nbsp; You play a new character called Nero:<br /><br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 538px; height: 334px"" src=""http://www.videogamechat.net/pics/262-obslrbiafc.jpg"" /><br /><br />the game is quite captivating, the graphics are astounding, &nbsp;esp. the backgrounds, really lovely lighting effects. but its a <strong>veryyyy easyy </strong>game (but i only played the demo, so maybe they'll surprise me in the full game?). the moves are simple enough to execute, and the enemies are easy to exterminate, except perhaps for the bosses. the demo basically ends when you kill off the Berial (demon god) boss. seems like a pretty straight-forward game. and the only weapons i got during the demo was a gun, the <em>devil bringer&nbsp;</em>move<em>&nbsp;</em><em>(when Nero's infected/demonish hand gets bigger and elongates and can grab and slam enemies onto the ground)</em>&nbsp;and a sword.&nbsp;Cos once you've played ninja giaden, heh, you'd find any other hack and slash game dead easy lol :P there's just no comparison. But GOSH, the camera!!! its such a bitch, really frustrating! the camera is so slow and it can't pick up with the speed of your running, its so hard to control &gt;___&lt; Also, why do they need to have a cutscene of&nbsp;EVERY new enemy that we have to fight??!!! wastes my time. would't it be better if they surprised us instead? <br />BUT LOLLLL, i just love the <u>'taunt' </u>button( is there even a purpose for it?): &nbsp;when you press it,&nbsp;Nero basically bows down and says ' May I have this dance?' all gentleman-like, lol&nbsp;XDDDD I'm really curious as to when that taunt button might become useful, maybe later in the game, when you wanna pick up some girls? XDDD oi oi, i didn't know Nero was the flirty-type? hehehe anyway, i thought I'd hate Nero cos he just looks like a duplicate clone substitute for Dante (or should I say...a <em>kiddy</em> version of Dante?xD), but his personality ain't so bad as i expected. nothing special though and i can't wait to play Dante when i buy the full version game!!!! &gt;A&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>LOVE this screenshot they show when you finish the demo: Dante vs. Nero :<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/794/794146/devil-may-cry-4-20070604115522564.jpg"" /><br /><br />Hey, i wonder if they're related somehow? XD<br />anyway, gives me something to look forward to, yeah,&nbsp;their fight would be awesome! *_________*<br /><br />P.S. Did i forget to mention that you can RUN ON&nbsp;WATER now (yes, you heard me!), all ninja-like&nbsp;(like in Naruto)&nbsp;in Ninja Gaiden 2??? its soooo cool!!!!! :D"

"event","Yayy! <span style=""font-size: small""><strong><span style=""color: #339966"">HAPPY RAMADAN MUBARAK EVERYONE!!!!!!! </span></strong></span>:DDDDD<br />So today was the first day of roza (and the longest, if i may add, about 15 hours! D: gahh i nearly passed out)&nbsp;and ofcourse everyone fasted but omg&nbsp;i nearly missed the sehri cos we had to wake up at 3:30 am in the morning &gt;__&lt; and the aftari was at <strike>7:15&nbsp;</strike> 7:50 pm. but we all managed to survive *phew* i must endure! &gt;A&lt;<br />oh yeah, on saturday we had a party to attend at our friend's house, to celebrate the daughter's admission into 'Imperial University'! many congratulations to her! As some of you may know, Imperial is the 3rd best University in the entire UK, so its quite impressive that she managed to get in. She will be studying Medicine as well, although she has already done 3 years of Biomedical Sciences (she's 21&nbsp;yrs old right now), so she's a postgraduate. And therefore, the number of years for her to study medicine will be reduced to 4 years instead of the standard 5. Im really happy for her, but also a lil teensy bit jealous, lol XD. can't help that, since I had a tour in Imperial, and its sooo GOOD. *envies* anyway, then on sunday, me and my bro went to London, and i was finally able to grab me a few mangas, mostly xxxholic. <br />And wow, i heard that you and your family, Asmara, went to visit the Baltimore Zoo!!!!! omg, thats great! you guys must have seen sooo many awesome animals. hahha, saw all the pics too and the one with the sea otter chasing Maarij's cap, LMAO! hehe, loved the last pic, I call it: 'The three lil' penguins', lol XDDD you guys looked really cute!&nbsp;<br />ok, talk to you&nbsp;guys laterz!<br />byeeee&nbsp;:3&nbsp;&nbsp;"

It saves me having to upload them all on LJ or photobucket, hehehhe :D Please inform me if you haven't recieved them, and i'll resend it.

"event","Umm...just wanted to let everyone know that im going to Manchester tomorrow to visit rashid mamoo!!!! :DDDD (well, only me, saad, and mummy are going, our dad&nbsp;will be&nbsp;occupied with his&nbsp;job during&nbsp;this weekend, so he can't come, sadly D:). so we'll leave at&nbsp;6:00 pm in the afternoon, take the train to London Victoria,&nbsp;and since we've already booked our tickets for the coach&nbsp;to take us directly to Manchester, we'll just hop on the 8:00 pm one. (btw, the tickets were 12 pounds per adult, so the total amount we had to pay was 72 pounds which includes the return tickets, so not bad) We'll arrive at Manchester at 1:00 am (in the night).Then rashid mamoo will hopefully come pick us up from the coach station (if he's not too lazy, that is ~__~)&nbsp;and we're gonna stay over at mamoo's until Monday, yaayyyyy! can't wait!!!! *___* this will be my first time visiting Manchester and seeing rashid mamoo's house(cos im curoius how he maintains his house)! ^___^ i bet it'll be loads of fun! and abeera mami can cook us some yummy-licious dishes for us to indulge in *drools* hmm..also i just recently borrowed the 'catcher in the rye' book from the library, i haven't started reading it yet, but this would be a good opportunity for me to read the book on the coach, as its a 4 hour journey to Manchester! yup!&nbsp;XD oh and i haven't forgotten to upload those pics and videos of the IMAX visit, its just....that i haven't had any time, like at all, and they're a pain to upload from the mobile...sowiieeee!!! &gt;__&lt;&nbsp;but..but...how about i offer a drawing as a treat, eh? XDDD well, its not good but i have nothing else to share at the moment, so i guess this will have to do?

(srzly, whats with me and my sudden urge to draw fanart? &gt;.&lt;) anyway, he is the main character, and he plays as&nbsp;a pitcher and is also the 'Ace' of the team. however, he is really shy, timid, and has zero confidence in himself, which&nbsp;you find annoying at first cos of his constant crying, stuttering, and whimpering, but then as you progress through the manga, that attitude of his suddenly appears more adorable and cute&nbsp; &gt;w&lt; you just sort of find those qualities of his more appealing.&nbsp;but,&nbsp;i decided not to draw him how he usually is (which is usually like a scared lil' puppy dog XD) cos..i just can't draw cute people!!!!*gets shot* &gt;__&lt; haha, i drew him&nbsp;more emoooooo, or contemplative, for a lack of a better word... XDDDD&nbsp;gah, my drawing skills are seriously degrading.....there is no proportion or anything.....TT__TT!!!!!!!!!! (i don't even use any references!!! its all from the head, and using my imagination! DX i fail!) i envy&nbsp;those&nbsp;who can draw full-body figures and come up with crazily inventive backgrounds...cos im absolutely pathetic in those categories, lolz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

B booster'</em> and&nbsp;they also needed to do another additional test...........an HIV test!!!! O__O which is <em>now</em> a necessary test to do to all new medical students, because obviously we'll be in direct contact with all sorts of&nbsp;patients&nbsp;during our training so its essential that&nbsp;patients also need to be protected against doctors/staff who&nbsp;are HIV positive. so she did my blood test and also gave me the Hep. B injection. but.....im scared. im really.... reallyyyyyyy..... scared......!!!! T__T&nbsp;&nbsp;what if i come out <em>positive</em> for HIV?!! my whole life will be ruined! people need to be mentally prepared for this sort of stuff,&nbsp;but this is&nbsp;way too sudden for me! im way too young to know whether i have HIV! gahhhhhh.!!! I DONT APPROVE OF THIS!!! noeesss! &gt;__&lt; im scared&nbsp;because i know i have been in contact with a few HIV patients in the hospital, and ofcourse&nbsp;you deal with their bloods cos thats my line of work, and i honestly dont recall ever having a needle-stick injury so the chances of me contracting this is very low....but what if I.....by some accidental chance...DO?&nbsp;;___; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said they would&nbsp;post the results to me at home, and that if i do&nbsp;come out positive,&nbsp;they might not send the result, but then i would know&nbsp;that im positive cos i didn't recieve them, right? D: gahh i dunno, im just distressed. but, um...they said that even if a student 'has'&nbsp;HIV, that doesn't prevent them from becoming a doctor or practising medicine, its just that they would place certain restrictions on what&nbsp;they can do, like what sort of&nbsp;procedures they're allowed to&nbsp;or not allowed to do to, to protect the patients' as well as their colleagues'&nbsp;safety. i will just have to pray that i&nbsp;come out negative....inshallah! ameen. God please HELP ME!!!!! TT__TT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","arghh, working yesterday was absolutely terrible! we were sooo short staffed in the hospital (cos so many ppl were off sick or were on a leave) that i had to do the entire A-block alone (all by my self! *le gasp*). and that inculdes the A6, A5 and A3 wards which are considered one of the toughest wards in the hopsital, because you're stuck with all the elderly patients who are in sick, unhealthy and in poor conditions,which makes it all the harder to&nbsp;bleed them &gt;__&lt;&nbsp;I had a total of 22 patients, which ain't a lot, but its not the numbers here that was the problem: it was the fact that they were all so awkward and difficult to bleed!!! (TT__TT) to top that off, one of the patients nearly fainted after i took&nbsp;her bloods,&nbsp;and she went all bradycardia while talking with the doctors, so they called an emergency team, but the doctors reassured me that it had nothing to do with me taking her bloods, and that it was just her condition. she soon recovered in 15 minutes after they gave&nbsp;her oxygen. &nbsp;Anyway, i asked one of the lady doctors whether I should pod the blood test results 'urgently'&nbsp;to the lab for them, and she thanked me for giving her this good idea and for being so kind, hehehehe XD (sorry, i just like being praised for once *__*)&nbsp;well...nevermind. i struggled, but the important thing is that i&nbsp;finished the entire wards all by myself! (i should feel proud, right?&nbsp;:D)&nbsp;<br /><br />*phew* now that thats out of my system, i can talk&nbsp;about tennis, which is fast becoming a popular topic here, i never&nbsp;knew so many ppl would be interested in tennis.&nbsp;which brings me to the bad news: andy murray lost against the spanish, Nadal, but then again, who didn't see that coming? it wasn't a surpirise, but i guess, deep within me, i secretly hoped&nbsp;Murray would win, probably by some sort of miracle, lolz. *sigh* wasn't meant to happen. i guess he's&nbsp;just not ready yet, still too young&nbsp;and slightly inexperienced, he wouldn't even come close to Federer so i guess the right man won in the end, haha XD. Good news is: Federer won against Mario,&nbsp;so im expecting another Federer vs. Nadal final! hehe ;D ive got some huge expectations for him! ^__^&nbsp;<br /><br />aaaaaaand...... my bathroom is being built, which has consequently made my room a bit smaller cos it has consumed quite a bit of space, but im not fretting, ive learned to&nbsp;accept the fact that you can't&nbsp;have everything your way -___- but that just means that my bathrrom will be even bigger than originally designed/planned so thats certainly something good to look forward to, isn't it? :P<br /><br />i got a post today from my doctor, and apparently he booked an appointment for me with the Haemotology clinic on the 29th of July. I'll have a blood test done again and I have to bring a urine sample with me&nbsp;as well (which i have never done before, lolz&nbsp; XD) i believe this appointment is just to&nbsp;do a special test to confirm whether i actually do have the 'alpha thalassaemia trait' or not &gt;__&gt;&nbsp;either way, it doesn''t bother me too much cos its not&nbsp;something that will affect me a whole lot.&nbsp;at least i hope it doesnt D:&nbsp;<br /><br />currently, totally obsessed over this song/video:<br /><br />&nbsp;<a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=o43XFohNVyA"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=o43XFohNVyA</a>&nbsp;The song is called : 'new paradise' by w-inds. i just looove the dances and the choreography is really good. plus, the main lead singer, Keita, is just so cute!&nbsp;3&gt; and this video was when they were 17 or 18 years old? his voice has&nbsp;COMPLETELY changed now from when he was young, so mature but still beautiful nonethless (he's what. 22 yrs old now?)&nbsp;i guess&nbsp;hitting puberty changed everything, he's even grown muscles&nbsp;lol XD.&nbsp;<br />another awesome dancing video i like of theirs is&nbsp; this:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=nlEQQW3imxs"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=nlEQQW3imxs</a>&nbsp;even better than 'new paradise'. i only heard about 'w-inds' recently because 'reborn's' new ending theme song was by them, and i was attracted to the singer's voice so i had to check them out. when i heard their songs, i instantly thought: cool, they're&nbsp;'re&nbsp;perfect for dancing! (with all the nice beats in the music) and whaddya know, they&nbsp;DO dance! didn't expect that at all hehhehee XD. *adds them to my list of best ''singer + dancers'' *&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","<p>oh god! Nadal is like on a winning streak here! my hatred for him just keeps growing. <em>First</em>, he secures the French Open championship by beating No.1 Roger Federrer, <em>then</em> he beats one of my fav. tennis players, Novak Djokovic ( even though they were both neck to neck and it was an extremely intense game right till the end) , and <em>NOW</em> he wants to win the the Wimbledon! (as if&nbsp;winning two championships consecutively&nbsp;isnt enough)&nbsp;&gt;__&lt; He already clinched the match&nbsp;against the german qualifier, Andreas&nbsp;Beck, today which means he can advance to the 2nd round. Although, to be perfectly honest, &nbsp;Beck really didn't put as much effort into the third set and just nearly gave up towards the end. And i was deeply&nbsp;frustrated&nbsp;by his poorly executed&nbsp;lobs, backhands, and volleys, definitely proving the fact that he was an amateur. But..hehehe *snickers* the fact that Nadal struggled with a <em>newbie</em> is like the ultimate humiliation for the No.2 ranked tennis player in the world HEHEHHEHHE!!!!! Its all thanks to Beck's weirdly unorthodox serving style, and the fact that he hits close to nadal's body making it hard to retaliate and&nbsp;hit the ball in the right direction with a good angle, putting&nbsp;Nadal in a predicament. But&nbsp;ofcourse,&nbsp; the Spaniard prevails&nbsp;once again...&gt;__&lt; &nbsp;he's like an annoying lil' pest TT^TT I would give anything to have him beaten at the Wimbledon, anything! -__- Oh but there's good news as well: Andy Murray, the only <em>'British'&nbsp;</em> qualifier( and the&nbsp;youngest)&nbsp;at the moment, has emerged victorious over Fabrice Santoro! He won!!!! Yipeeeee~~~~~ *feels so proud of him as he had the whole weight of Britain on his shoulders XD* I admit, i felt really worried at first, because Santoro's aces were really spot-on and accurate, and&nbsp;Murray, the young lad, is known to make the odd silly mistakes, but im glad he managed to pull it off in the end *relief*&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height=""300"" alt=""/sport/2008/06/24/murray.jpg"" width=""199"" border=""0"" src=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/06/24/murray.jpg"" /><br /><br />GO Murray GO!!!!! keep the British spirit alive! Fight-on! You're our last hope!&nbsp;YOSHI!!!!!!!!! ^O^<br /><br />Ciao guys~&nbsp;<br /><br />P.S: Me and my brother are thinking of going to&nbsp;Wimbledon with some of his friends sometime this week, if possible, &nbsp;i would like to catch&nbsp;a match with Roger federer or Djokovic or even Sebastian Grosjean XD. &nbsp;But we still haven't finalised the plan or anything. we'll see how it goes....</p>"

"event","Hey has anyone checked out the Waterstone's website: <a href=""http://www.waterstoneswys.com/"">http://www.waterstoneswys.com/</a>&nbsp;They're offering these small cute story cards written by famous authors,&nbsp; and a compettiion to write and contribute your own story. They're only short stories, and you can read all of them by clicking the 'Read our authors' stories' button and then picking one of 13 authors to read their little ficlet. I only read J.K.Rowling's and Neil Gaiman's, which were amusing and cute (although not very unique, to be honest. I think they only wanted to give a little taste to their fans to motivate them to write better stuff, hehe ;D) . Ah, how I love Rowling's handwriting, so beautiful! *envies* But this&nbsp;gave me an idea,&nbsp;how about posting your own little short story on this site when you're done with&nbsp;it, Maru? that would be&nbsp;so awesome! im sure you'll rock everyone's socks off with&nbsp;your brilliant&nbsp;writing! *big grin* ^___^ hehe, only a suggestion&nbsp;tho~&nbsp;&nbsp;XD oh and I did another super rough drawing, on MS Paint (not fanart this time, just original) XD&nbsp;(i dont know why, but im&nbsp;really itching to draw a lot these days on the comp instead of my usual hand-drawn stuff. and where, you may ask, is this sudden urge coming from? watching and reading REBORN, thats where! XDDD cos the manga artist really inspires me, she does lovely action scenes too, which i have a real penchant for~ :D) &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><u>The dark prince:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h235/eternal191/thedarkprince-final3.jpg?t=1213747861"" /><br /></u></strong><br />so much red!!!!

"event","Two children got killed by stabbing yesterday. My dad, who works in the Accident and Emergency department, had night duty last night so he was there to operate on&nbsp;two of the&nbsp;children, they had&nbsp;stab wounds on their necks from a knife attack. Three siblings were attacked, but unfortunately the eldest, who was a 5 year old boy, died before reaching the hospital.&nbsp;The&nbsp;other two were a&nbsp;4 year old girl and a 6 month old baby girl who&nbsp;were admitted to ST. Helier Hospital, where my dad (including me) works. my&nbsp;dad was able to save the 6 month old baby&nbsp;( she was later transferred to the London's Children Hospital, and her current state has improved)&nbsp;who was also stabbed but the cut was not as deep as the older girl's, who had&nbsp;been stabbed through the neck which also pierced into one of the lungs. Although my dad opened her chest to stop&nbsp;the lung from bleeding and sutured it up,&nbsp;she had already lost too much blood from her neck wound, and despite the medical team's best efforts to&nbsp;resuscitate her for an hour, she didn't survive. My dad was about to suture the chest and close it back, but then the police came and announced that this was a crime scene, and that they were not allowed to remove anything or touch the body as post-mortems&nbsp;were going to be carried out, so he had to leave it open. You can read more about the incident here, on the BBC website:&nbsp;<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7428946.stm"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7428946.stm</a> (there's also a video on the bottom of the website which shows my dad's hospital) This bit of news even&nbsp;appeared on the T.V. as one of the main Headlines on BBC.&nbsp;My&nbsp;dad was really upset last night and he even cried mostly because the kids were so young, and didn't deserve having their innocent lives cut short. Its such a shock, really, to think that&nbsp;there are parents who would do such a cruel and terrifying act to their kids, and try to murder them. Its unthinkable. I mean if they don't like kids, then why give birth to them in the first place? And im curious, who actually did call the police? Was it the mother, cos she had some minor injuries as well, so perhaps it was the father&nbsp;who tried to kill them, and the mother tried protecting her kids? Let us hope that whoever&nbsp;murdered the two kids&nbsp;is punished and that the young baby girl&nbsp;recovers soon. Its just really sad :(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

I guess its no surprise, since he's such an interesting and mysterious character, not to mention,&nbsp;he's easy to draw ;) But i also wanted to test my tablet skills since its been about 7 months&nbsp;since i last even touched my tablet! (i know, im terrible! *smacks head*&nbsp;~__~) so yeah, this was&nbsp;drawn using my tablet on photoshop,&nbsp;nothing special.&nbsp; Just wanted to share as its been a such a long while since i posted&nbsp;one :D But really, its so hard to get any inspiration these days to draw something productive, i'm soo losing my touch &gt;__&lt;<br />&nbsp;<u>Edit:</u> Uploaded a larger version of pic :)<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h235/eternal191/Yoite-oekakifinal4croppedcopy.jpg?t=1210443983"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

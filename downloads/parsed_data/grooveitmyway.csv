WOW.... amazingly Cherie manage to graduate from RP!!! Wanna thank all the gods who have been watchin over n blessing me throughout the journey of studies and happenings in life!!! Currently workin at a golf company teachin the atas kids golf. At first very excited bt now NOOO! Waitin for phone calls frm all over the places n pls grant me a place for the all the choices that i want! agreeable, waitin totally SUX!!! Y am i always sooo lazy since primary sch? Lazy bugs pls go awayyyyy....... Gettin worse as i grow older...Nonono all this must stop!!! Wanna kill all the lazy bugs in me!! Arghhh..... 

Most of the things that i seemed confident in always turn out nt so gd... yy?? Tried hard bt in the end does not pay off as well. All this shits have decrease all my confidence. Hmmm... y oh y...? Whats wrong wit me??? Some things seemed aight to me bt to others nt... How come??? Agreeable wit Human motor and control module, in a study, it is concluded that children who are early maturer who tend to have confidence, achievement and happnenings in life frm age 13 to 16 years old will turn out to have low confidence n self-esteem as they grow older and reaching adult as compared to late maturer. This is due to the late maturer are catching up in life with the early maturer. The early maturer will find it challenging havin to compete with more people (late maturer) as a result of lower confidence and self esteem for the early maturer. True True quite true though.   

Facing quite a tough time at work recently. Maybe I am not focus enough or the boss really sucks! I don c any problems if its at any other centers. It is said that shits that make you grow.... How long more will the shits last?? Puttin behind these shitty shits, I hope that i can start joggin and dancin really soon like now.... 2 wks later gotta go for my physio session and hopefully there will be good news!! and then please pass my medical report!! Prayin to all the gods.... Please bless me! Cherie, HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE!!!!    

Well, pretty happy that jetstar allow us to change destination. So we've all decided to go Macau on end June!! Hopefully we'll be allocated seats soon means that its confirm! Finally, theres news regardin Australia study trip, its on startin June. However, most of my galfrenz are not gg anymore, therefore, stil in doubt whether to go or nt as ill hav to slp wit ppl i donno! most prob ill giv it a go cos ive nv been to Melbourne b4 n also an opportunity to visit their unis and sports industry there, moreover, its free! If i'll b away for both trips in june, there wil b problem wit my job side. Think I'm really gonna get fired this time. Therefore, Ill hav to be faster than them and say bye bye first if things does not work out. Cherie, ""Its also time to step out from your comfort zone""

3 more weeks before school ends... Have alot of thoughts what to do next for the next phrase of life. This time, I seriously don wanna regret with my decision and hopefully things would be great, smooth and successful. Times really fast without you realizing. Almost quited RP 2 years ago.. Well, I'm wondering if i really quited, what will life be like now? better or worse? Although, i regretted choosing and studying at RP, I am still thankful of what I have been through throughout RP years that make me who i am now. I have taken my friends for granted yes i agree with that. I wanna thanks those true and wonderful friends out there whom have always been honest and truthful towards me.. You guys have made me become more appreciative in life, thanks to my injuries too. If i could turn back time, i could have treated my friends better and well and done more good deeds. Well, (shits that make you grow, 2009). Sometimes, I always wonder, are things really what it is or am i just thinking too much?

"event","Hellooo.. 
Decided not to go to school again cos the pain on my knee is back might due to no sufficient  rest during the weekends.. 
Made the right choice as after lunch, had stomach cramp. Well, i wanna use this time to study real hard for coaching final UT on wed, however, when posed with qns regarding the topic, Im still little confused. Hope Ill be able get some help soon. SOS pls someone help me!!! Browsed through a bit of outdoor leadership what would be tested on sent by my kind fren, I started to sweat and lost hope, alot of qns mark appear on my head, god bless me... n yeh finally after 2 wks of flu and cough, it has gooo awayyy! =)

Alright, during the weekends, as i have stayed at home for around 3 days b4 the wkends, i had feel better. Either watchin TV or playing comp. Im kinda bored and cant sit still and be kept at home anymore. Wanted to go out of house and catch some fresh breather. I tagged along my mom and eldest sis and little Jayden and very very slowly walked to the coffee shop opposite SOKA association. I was cravin for the korean chicken bbq and kimchi soup. So cravin was satisfied and cured there. Afterthat, went back home after buyin a bubble tea at Ocha... Whoaa... By the time halfway through the journey back hm, my strength on my right leg and left hand were almost used up. I was sweatin like hell on a cold day and my sis said Im sick... =X I managed to endured through and made it hm. When i reached home, i knew my left knee's gonna giv way again and its not right like b4. So i quickly sat down on the chair and ice it.. it got a bit btr.

On sunday, went to support the gals at kallang netball centre for the inter-cc game. What a close match for the first and last match. Its ok, training had only started months and few wks before... Lets work harder and trash them to the drain! =) call it an unlucky day cos shers gt  2 sumons in a day and lost the game when everythin was soooo close, juz a goal! A lucky day cos had good and delicious food at shers' dad shop... VERY THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH Shers and family for the good food, we were all blessed! =) When i reached home, i felt lil and lil pain on my knee and i hav a feelin its not tt right anymore so I tried to ice it hoping it wil get btr n the pain might go away, however, it did not. Now, i hav to bring forward my appt date to wed instead of fri. 
Being a supporter at the match had free sun tannin session. My face, arms and legs were burnt until When jayden saw me ytd, he asked me "" A-yi, y are you sooo red?"" n keep laughing n pinched my cheek and yeh its reali painful when he did that.

Alamak! my stomach is crampin non-stop and is waiting for tt lil boy to come back n disturb him.... signnin off as i cant concentrate anymore. wil be back for more, wil try to add pics so its not tt borin n wont fall aslp readin halfway..
Take care everyone!!!

"event","Hey hey...
Im currently at home as i did not go for last lesson of ""outdoor leadership"" module due to my knee injury and after a week of walkin with clutch and support from lovely people, my calf and some leg muscles cant make it anymore, it started to cramp and all. So i decided to stay at home to also save cab fare.  

Just realised that it has been 25 weeks since I updated this blog!!! Wow... Alot alot n alot of things has happened within this 25 weeks..... This is the last week of year 3 sem 1 alr.. so slow yet so fast! and ytd was FYP presentation.. yeahh... FYP 1 completed!!! =)) more to come FYP 2 and also UT3... FIGHTIN!!!  
I am very glad that the netball team has started training together and preparing for competitions. Yeh i do enjoy every training and dinner after training with the girls. =)

Ever since Swine Peak period when the TRCC close down until reopens, have not been dancing alot from then.. Cos immune system was down, fall sick and wanted to take the swine peak to take a break. Wanted to start afresh in dancing after the break. Yeh I managed to start practicin again for a few weeks. After the few weeks, flu bug attacked me again, at first i thought it wouldn't be that serious and decided to be my doctor, however, it started to get worse. My nose was blocked until i have to breathe through my mouth and my voice became more manly as each day passed. It has been 2 weeks until nw and has not fully recover yet. Unfortunately, this break have to continue on...

So i thought i will start practicing hard after i have fully recovered, unfortunately, last thursday (6th august 2009) while playing full netball game with some league players and our girls, as believed landing posture was awkward, my leg suddenly ""Nua"" as if somebody hitted hard behind my knee and fell down staright. That moment was super painful due to the shock but i know its gonna be ok n not very serious. I was able to walk back n rest on my own after a while. So i rested for a while and i was ok alr, i went back court n played GS position again. while waiting for the game to start, i tried to move a lil ard the court to make sure that i am ok n actually i am not too sure whehter i am ok. The ball just came towards me before i cld decide, the moment when i tried to run and catch the ball, the second moment was i felt a shift on my knee n fell on the floor with a sharp pain. It was freakin painful, at that moment alot of thoughts came on my mind, ""Do i have to give up sports? dance? and i cant jog anymore? when wil i recover?....."" This time, I was not able to walk properly without any help.. Ah long brought me to polyclinic on 2nd day of injury main objective is to see my leg and get referal letter to CGH, and can also ""sun bian"" get medication for flu n cough.. 
Well after a week from the mishap, i don feel anymore pain on my knee, however, not able to fully straighten although it did have improvement from previous time. Still not able to bend yet.. Well i hope its just a sprain and not hav any tear... =)
Thanks to those people who have been helping me around throughout be it in school, home or anywhr.. If not i wldnt have been what i am now.. KAM-SA HUM-NIDA!!! BIG BIG THANKSSS!!!! Appreciate it from the bottom of my heart! 

Well, many shitty things hav happened....... N yeh i believe that ""shits that make you grow (cherie, 2009)"" =)
Hope things will get better as time goes on....

Love,
Cherie"

Anyway, Greetings to all of u!! HAPPY NIU YEAR PULL YOUR EAR!!! =)) 

Time past very very freakin fast!! Have been dancin n dancin without keepin track of time. Lots of shity n nice stuff happened in 2008 that made me who i am now.. Wanted to list down all the happening events but I am havin mind block now. Wil try to do it some other time... Haha... 

Currently, CNY this year is kinda not very happening. Ang bao $$$$$ has decline alot. However, this year, I went to my brother-in-law mom's hse and bai nian. She cooked ""xing hua mian xian"" n its super nice!! I like it alot!! Afterthat went to my ah mah's place n eat again.. Gonna grow fat again like a balloon!!!!!! I cut down alot on new year cookies but juz cant stop eating ""BAGUA"" wherever i can see it. 
On 2nd day of CNY, when i opened my eye, i found out tt i was alone at hm... everybody abandoned me =( my parents left KFC breakfast on the table for me. For the very first time i was abandoned on 2nd day of CNY. After the lonely breakfast, I went to watch TV, ""air crash invetigation"" aftertt some MTV show. After a while, i heard noises comin frm my ah gong's hse. Juz nice, my mom called me n asked to go over n bai nian. The hse was super packed until there were so little space for me to work. I managed to earn some ang bao. At night, went to cousin's place n play mahjong in the end i have to pay them $$$$ not they pay me $$$$$!!!!!
Happy n rest day has soon gone... Have to start funka dance prac on 3rd day of cny alr.

Last nite theme was retro.. All the grps dressed accordin to the theme.. I like senlintia pink outfit the most! Dream factory performance wasnt their best ytd, there were some fault on the lead guitar. The cable came off frm the amplifier, d sound assistance quickly pluck in back to the amplifier, however, DF was nt on their luck ytd, the amplifier was nt workin properly bt it did manage to gt the sound back after a while."

Hey! 
A busy week has ended... The tough preparatory for Code Edge Showcase was really a great experience! I have learnt alot of things and grown to become a better dancer.. The Code Edge competition was held 2 days ago, 15 dec at Zouk. I really enjoyed myself alot and had a wonderful night performing for the opening and watching the competition. The item by the guest judges is super Dope!!!! I love all the parts of their item especially when Patrick and Gigi was dancing to Thats The Way Love Goes by janet Jackson. Patrick chen, Gigi Torres and daniel Lee, they are from Dance2xs. They came to Singapore to conduct master classes and this competition. They are top dancers from the US and choreographer for all the famous celebrities in US and Taiwan. I did not attend their 3 days workshop the other time. However, I saw the 3 US instructors practicing their item last Thusday at Studio Wu after my practice for the showcase. I was can't take my eyes off them!!!! They are really super duper good!!! Its then, I was sooo in love with Patrick Chen! Gigi is cool!!!! Daniel style is like JP.  

8/1/2008:
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONEE!!!! =)
Dance2xs is coming back to Singapore early this year ard mar or apr...
Trying to save $$$$ for the master classes. Will be coming back for more of my life soon. I am too tired to write now... Actually wanted to pose some pics but the connection is super damn slow now.. Well will do it soon! 
GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY!!!

I like Japanese culture and lifestyle not talkin bout after gettin married to a Japanese guy although i'm dreamin of~~~~~~ That's a different thing. Unless my hubby is nt a Japanese but the we live there.. Hahaha... 

There are difference in the lifestyle between people in Tokyo and Osaka. Tokyo is more of a city area. Most people you can see on the streets will dress in smart casual style. People there are more of working adult and they tend to be fast and tense up, less relax, more stressful. But when they are not in their workin or schoolin attire, everyone would dress in a very unique and stylish way that if you dress like them in Spore people will stare at you thinkin that you are crazy!  

Whereas in Osaka and other parts of Japan like Kyoto, people there are more relax and dress more casually. Their dressin style are a little different from people in Tokyo. They are more simple and nice as compared to Tokyo. Example, people in Osaka would dress in jeans and tee and acessorise themselves and of course make up! They look very beautiful and stylish! However in Tokyo, I saw many girls dress and make themselves look excatly like a Disney charaters in Disney Land!! Their ways of dressin are in a more daring way. 

Life in Japan can be stressful and relax... It depend on your purpose and what you are doing there....

I love Japan!!!! =)"

Had rehearsal yesterday at the actual day venue which is at TRCC 400 seaters studio. Although everyone was super tired and hungry, they tried their best to give all out as if it was the real performance. We had 2 run. First one was not very good. After comments from Tricia, mikal and fel, we had a 2nd run, it was much more better than the first one. All the groups improved alot!!

"event","I am done with my training for the post office for now, I know how to drive on the right side of the car. I have CDL training next week.

As for the canadian squatters. Here's the story

Some friends of my aunt and Rachelle, were bringing a racehorse down to portland from canada, and got stopped at the border because the vet had marked the horse down as a gelding instead of a filly on the coggins and health check, the trailer driver subsequently abandoned the filly at a warmblood stable near the border and Julie and Will (the friends) didn't find out that the horse was still in canada until they'd already reached the Tri-Cities, Needing a place to stay they spent that first night with Rachelle and Sam, but their house is tiny, and Rachelle was sick so we brought them over here while they tried to sort out the horse situation. Track people tend to be somewhat less than wealthy and these two are no exception, as a result they have been mooching off us for almost two weeks. They were supposed to be gone last tuesday. Still Here. They finally managed to get their horse over the border last night, but now they need to get her from selah, to the track in portland. They are currently squabbling in the living room. I'm starting to worry that we'll never see the back of them, their two dogs, and their scrawny obnoxious cat. They have a predeliction for smoking weed in my garage, and the smell that subsequently follows them around is atrocious.

I'm basically just keeping myself locked in my bedroom for the duration.

"event","So I went a little crazy with the blog things. I haven't been able to use tolerable internet for a while so I needed to catch up. We finally have clearwire out here in the boondocks though so I can screw around to my hearts content now. Anyways, 

I essentially have no life right now. My friends are all elsewhere, I haven't done anything productive since August, with the exception of an endless supply of yardwork and housework. How three people create so much work is a mystery to me. 

I should be back at the post office by next month, I applied for a job as a TE Carrier and I'm just waiting for my driving test results before I can start training, sadly I have to do the training all over again and I probably wont be able to start for another three weeks because of the training schedule. but it's an infinitely better job than the one I was working at the PO before because I get annual leave, 60% more pay and best of all I get to work days. I have come to the conclusion that the only way I'm going to ever get to use my degree is if I go back to school, which I'm not ready to do. As much as I miss having no real responsibilities. 

Anyways, that's life as I know it.

"event","I'm giving you the short version in a numbered format, you can pick and choose your details on your own.
Here's the rundown.
1.) Graduated in December of last year, am still looking for a job in my field.
2.) Bought a Saint Bernard puppy in June, he is now Huge.
3.) Met Dave at Boat Races this July, have been dating him ever since.
4.) Am currently working at the post office, my sleep schedule is resultingly abnormal.
5.) I quit smoking.

Here's the elaborate version.

1.) I had a nightmare graduation. My grandfather drove down from Colorado, and then dissapeared in a snit the evening before my graduation. I haven't heard from him since. outside of that, WSU took their sweet time sending me my diploma, but it really doesn't matter because I haven't had cause to use it since then. I've applied at half the Zoos and aquariums in the country and have interviewed at five or six but I haven't heard from them since, which is probably for the best since I can't afford to move anyways. It would be easier if I didn't have the horses and the dog, but they go where I go. not to mention the three cats and my snake.

2.) Doc is the most ridiculously adorable thing I've ever seen. He's five months old and already weighs 75lbs. I know that buying a giant dog like a St. Bernard seems ridiculous, but his dad is my best friends dog, and he's the sweetest, most well behaved dog in the world, and this was going to be his last litter as he was fixed immediately after breeding. I paid the stud fee in exchange for pick of the litter and so far Doc has been a miniture version of his father, though judging by his current size he will eventually be bigger than Vince. If anyone wants pictures give me a call and I'll send some to you. 

3.) Dave is 13 years older than me. I met him at boatraces. His friend Mark was hitting on me in the beer garden but he failed to keep my interest and I ended up going home with Dave. I had no idea that he was more than 27 years old tops. I also assumed I'd never see him again after that night but he asked for my phone number, and then actually used it! I wasn't quite sure how to react, but true to form I somehow have ended up in a relationship completely by accident. Despite some baggage (ex-WIFE anyone?) he seems to be pretty well adjusted. He's responsible without being too obnoxiously adult, he's capable of simultaneously keeping a plant and a dog alive, he makes me laugh, and he appears to be completely unflappable in the face of strange female behavior. I've thus far had one full fledged female freakout over literally nothing (as per strange female behavior code 16.22.86) and he literally didn't bat an eye. He calmly ignored the nervous breakdown, and then went on living life as though it never happened, literally, he hasn't mentioned it, he hasn't run away, if anything he's being more commitment-y. In the past my freak-outs have caused men to dissapear faster than you can say commitment phobe. I'm not sure how I feel about this level of commitment, but since I don't have time to date anyone else anyways, Ive decided to go with it, besides, I really like the guy. 

4.) I am working more than full time at the post office as a casual clerk. I already had 32 hours as of Monday. I had last night (tuesday by postal reconing (that's right we have our own calendar and our own time)) off and fully expect to get at least another 24 hours for the week. I certainly am welcoming the overtime but since Dave works the craziest schedule in history (Umatilla Chemical depot) we didn't see each other from October 19th until November 13th, which sucked. 

5.) I finally quit attempting to give myself cancer. After a couple months of weaning myself off of cigarettes I've finally gotten down to 0 cigarettes a day. I believe that this was the underlying cause for the aforementioned freak out (see section 3).

Gotta go to bed now.

Anyways, I don't have anything to study for, except for a quiz this friday, I actually got enough sleep last night, I have nothing due at the paper, and only one thing due at the chinook. I don't have to work in the morning, my mom's not coming to pullman for moms weekend so I don't have to attack my house with cleanliness. Today is a good day.

Anyways, I went to the While the Lights Were Out Rehearsal yesterday to write a story, and then I went to the Sweet Charity rehearsal tonight to write that story, and I have no life anymore that doesn't involve some kind of work or school or internship.

I'm starting to forget what Evan looks like, I saw him for a whopping half an hour this weekend, on sunday until Kyra called me to remind me that I had to go to staff meeting. I'm tired.

I can't seem to get up the energy to be anything else.

Speaking of Bayley Research, I'm discovering that horses don't like treadmills any better than people. It appears that a dislike for running and not going anywhere crosses the species boundary. On the other hand, our new horse Reo, hates everything about the project except for the treadmill, so I guess there are exceptions to every rule. and on that note, I think I'm going to go home and use this short lull in work to catch up on my sleeping.

He's been sick, so he's all grumpy, and now that he's better he's decided that we spent too much time together, which is weird because while he was sick he was constantly calling me wanting attention cause he was bored, and now he's decided that seeing me every day for a week is too much. not that we actually spent any real quality time together, it was just him whining about being sick and me playing mommy. and SO I AM NOT MAKING THE EFFORT. no more shall I even attempt to go over there, or call him. last time it took two days till he got worried and came to find out where I'd been.

I studied all day today, and most of yesterday, and for at least an hour for the past 6 days.

"event","I lost my phone, got a new one, found the old one, lost the new one, found the new one, all in about the course of a week. I have a gift.

In other news, Evan and I had another heart to heart as a result of him having far too much to drink (in a movie theater no less (the drinking not the talking)) and pretty much came to the same stupid conclusion as before, resulting in a serious waste of time that I could have used in sleeping. though I had a minor breakthrough in that by saying ""I'd rather live my life fully and painfully, then half-ass and safe"" I got hime to shut up long enough to fall asleep. He's been acting kind of weird since then, a little too nice, I think he's up to something.

Anyways, I'm going home this weekend. I'm so excited to see the ponies. I can't wait.

other than that, no news.

"event","So Saturday night Evan and I went over to the Bruce's to party. When we arrived, one ex boyfriend was already there, within five minutes my high school sweetheart showed up, and about 20 minutes after that Justin (you remember Justin from a few months back) showed up. 2 ex-boyfriends, a fuck buddy, and a current boyfriend, who by the way doesn't like to be referred to in that manner. In fact that was the basis of our fight cum heart to heart which eventually resulted in us leaving the party at 2:30 am. sometime during that period I tried to convince Bruce that Evan was perfectly capable of driving, aparently at the top of my lungs while gesticulating wildly with my cell phone. That, coincidentally, was the last time my cell phone was seen. at some point I lost it, and I am now unreachable via cell phone until Friday. Go me. 6 AM found me, not at work where I should have been, but rather sitting on my bathroom floor engaging in some rather stunning digestive pyrotechnics. 

I then spent the rest of the day, attempting to recover from my hangover, searching for my phone, and spending some of my europe money on a new phone. God'dammer'bob.

Amusing quote of the night from Eric :""If you do what I did I'll kill you. break her heart I'll break your legs"" *snort* protective ex-boyfriends are cute. jealous current boyfriends (don't tell him I called him that) are also cute, though in a slightly more distressing way."

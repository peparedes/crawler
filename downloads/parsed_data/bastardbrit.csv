"event","I've got a new job! That is, additional job. I now work as a PA to Professor Yancy of Psychology at Camebridge University, three days a week! It's probably my dream job right now, and he's has been very kind so far.

Also I've ordered tickets home for a weekend in about a months time. I have mixed feelings about this, but it'll be all good in the end, I suppose.

That's it for now journal-land."

"event","I haven't been online for so long now! Christmas was nice, even if it was only me and my Dad. I've gotten some presents, mainly from my father and I get to open the rest on Sunday. I can't wait to open the presents from Russia! I hope there'll be some good ol' Russian goodies in some of them, because I truly miss that.

But I recieved some not-so-nice news as well. My employers have decided to re-locate to Germany after all, to be closer to the brewery and what not. They offered me a position there, but I said I'd rather stay in London since I just got here and all. So today a delievery man came on the door with a brand new lap top and fax machine! I set the fax machine up in my room and mailed the number to Pilot. And this is me testing out the new lap top! I've got internet up and running, so now I need to install the book keeping programs, and transfer the files I'm currently working on and then I should be able to go back to work tomorrow.

I'll miss having an office though."

"event","This has been a long week! I think I got everything ordered, so now I need to work it through and then start planning ahead for the coming time. Work is fun! (I hope my radio didn't disturb anyone?)

This weekend I also got my presents sent back home. Babooshka wanted me to come visit, but I told her that it was too soon, which she accepted. It was nice talking to her though.

I went out Saturday night, but I didn't really talk to anyone. I never knew I could be this shy, but I suppose it's because everything is so new ans far from...safe.

Oh! Bedtime. I'm off. ;)"

"event","I had my first day at work today, and it was fun! I spent most of the day trying to sort through the various files and folders, putting them in the right order so that I can get started on them properly tomorrow. My bosses both seem really nice, so that was cool too. 

<lj-cut text=""And then I bought new shoes!"">

This is what my old shoes looked like right before I moved here:

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/bastardbrit/pic/000018tt"">

Yes, walking around London for a couple of weeks have not exactly healed them, so I got new ones (I don't have a camera, but I found this image through Google Images):

</lj-cut>

Then I was run over on the street! Not by a car, but by a bouncing man! He was pretty amazing like that, as far as I know he might have been a super hero with all that energy and all!

(I am sort of hoping we'll meet up again. A friend in London would be nice.)"

I also found some of the hidden gardens today. Like the ones you can see in ""Nothing Hill"". I didn't even quite believe it was like that, here in London. But I found them."

"event","I guess I should introduce myself. I'm Michael Blake, new to London. Hi, nice to meet you.

At least that is what I try to tell people I meet in RL, so it should probably be what I tell people online as well, no?

I got another job rejection e-mail yesterday. I wish I would get a job, I need something to do after I finish sight-seeing in London. I've been to Madam Tussuad and all the other big museums. Seen some parks, parliaments and castles. What've I missed?

Need to find me some pictures for this thing as well, one of the following days."

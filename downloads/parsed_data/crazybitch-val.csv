"event","What is wrong with everyone?? myself included, we are all just whiny and sniffly and bitchy for no reason. doesn't anything good ever happen to anyone anymore?? We all have pretty decent lives, kids, husbands (some of us), jobs (ok, no one i know has a job), nice homes to live in. we all have the basic necessities of life, are we just pissed because we aren't spoiled little brats that have every single thing our poor little hearts desire?? 

sorry for that, i would just like for once to click on LJ and see something happy again. when we all lived in texas, we always had something happy to say at least 2 or 3 times a week. and we were not the most friendliest with each other. 

i am not bashing on anyone for posting what they feel or how their days are going, but bad moods are contagious. figure out a way to say something nice. find something good that you are thankful for or happy about.

can't we all just have a GOOD day??

peace"

"event","lost in a world of choices between LJ and myspace, tonight i chose myspace. you wanna know why, because i try to save the happy stuff for here for the whole world to read (yes i am vain enough to think the whole world reads this jk). anyway, basically, i think i am homesick or something, just feeling a little down. maybe its because i am sick,who knows. wanna know details? read myspace, not my friend, don't read it, i don't care. whatever.

"event","ok, my turn, i have been replying and comment on so much stuff, that i feel like my head is going explode!! some people are worthless, and i am just gonna leave it at that!!

i have something to say to everyone:

i talked to my neice last night (the daughter of the sis i hate) and she was telling me that my sister still hasn't took any legal action on having Kaleb. which means that she never filed for permanant custody or anything!! she also said that he is spoiled rotten and that all he does anymore is sit around the house playing video games and getting chubbier and chubbier. so, i asked her what she thought i should do and she said to try and talk to my sister and if she didn't want to be cival then take her sorry ass to court. which is what i had already been planning on doing. anyway the good news is that, when we get to OK, we are only going to be 7 hours from where they live (thats nothing for a drive), and she said that she would bring him down to see me!!! I get to see my baby!! i am so excited i could pee my pants!! so, now we need to look for a 4 bedroom house instead of 3!! because you can bet your ass that i am going to get him back at least on a visitation basis. i miss him so much and my heart aches for him everyday. now i have one more thing to add to all the things to look forward to in the next 6 months. I get my friends closer, and my baby closer.

WOOOOHOOOOO!!!

"event","I finally remember the dream i had last night...

i was in this big house, mine i assume, and i was asleep in bed and i woke up and there was a dog next to the bed and then a cat jumped up on me, and i was like i don't have any pets, so i got up to see if maybe i left a door or window open. (i know weird) when i got up, there was nothing in my house. like NOTHING. no furnture, no clothes, no windows, no doors, nothing. Like someone had stolen it all. so, i was looking around my house and i see this girl from high school elizabeth and she is setting my house on fire, like she was trying to kill me or something. so i run out of the house and scream for someone to call the fire department. and i just stand there and watch the house go up in flames. then i teleport (cuz i can do that in dreams) and i am at a track meet or something with all my high school friends, and i am like, dude, my house burnt down last night, and of course no one cares or believes me. and then i am in a car with elizabeth and i am like why did you burn my house down? and then all i can remember is her saying something about a baby and i took it?? 

what the hell does that mean?? somebody tell me that please. it was so wierd because i woke up all sweaty and shaking. it seriously scared the shit out of me. and the odd thing is, me and elizabeth were pretty good friends. i dunno. i hope it isn't a reaccuring dream. that is the first dream i have had in a really long time that i actually remember, and i only remember it because i watched the movie Elizabethtown tonight. whats weirder, the dream or the fact that i picked that movie to watch?? (oh yah, the movie sucked too)

anyway, scott is coming home early from the feild. he'll be here at midnight tonight. but he still has to work tomorrow. he wasn't feeling well. i hope they can figure what is wrong with him. i hope its nothing serious. 

well, i need to go to sleep people.

"event","i am sooooo bored. there really is nothing to do around here. i have became a mindless internet dork! i have been sitting here for like 2 hours just goofing off on the computer. i am kinda glad i don't have sims because i would probably be playing it all the time! i think that maybe i could read a book or a magazine, but this medicine has me all zoned out, i can't concentrate on anything. maybe i will just go to bed early, the time difference is so weird, it seems like when i am awake everyone i know is asleep, when i am asleep, they are all awake! there are like 5 hours a day when it is even possible for me to talk to people. i wanna call chas and have her 3 way tegan, but it is only noon there. ryans in bed, and madison is getting ready for bed. i only have 2 cigerettes left. i can't even buy more because scott took the ration card (yes, they ration cigerettes). i quit for 4 days, and then i went out and going out always makes me wanna smoke. so that is just another reason to add to the hundreds, for why i may never go to another bar again!!

i ordered a digital camera, it should be here in a couple weeks, so i will finally be able to change my user pic and post some pics of the brats! everyone keeps asking me why i still have the same pic up there, well, because i am computer illiterate and i can't figure out how to put one of my myspace pics up there. 

today, i went back on LJ and i looked at all the posts from a year ago...

my first post as a LJ user:

Current mood:  on life, duh 
Current music: janice's music flippin' (i kissed a girl...) 

Here it is, my first day as a livejournal user. I am way to excited. I hope that people will actually read what i have to say. there are some times when i am sure that i will get on here and ramble endlessly about mindless events in my life that only a few select people will truely understand and appreciate.

so, in less than 2 months, i will be moving out of this ""country"" to explore the realms of another world!! At least that is the way that it feels to me. Never having been out of the USA, it is a little intimidating to me, but i know that i will adjust and overcome any fears that i have. and this is just one more adventure that i get to add to my list of things that i have done. i swore to myself, a long time ago, that i would never wait around for things to happen to me, i will go out and find them. I figure life is just one more adventure that some people take and some people pass up on. I am not gonna be a bench warmer in life!

that was about 2 months before me and janice took our infamous trip to NYC! that trip changed so much in my life, never thought that one decision could alter the way things turned out. Just reading that makes me laugh and think, ""wow, things were crazy back then."" Things sure have changed since then. Its amazing how things seemed so much easier then, maybe. No, not really. :)

well, i am on the phone with tegan and chas...ahhh things always seem so much better after i talk to them. everyone seems to be having a bad day. we just need to be back together. :)
well i should go for now, i am feeling kind of light headed and woozy from laying on the floor. my ears filled up, ouch, they hurt.

miss you guys.

"event","well, we are back from our weekend adventure. adventure? i don't know if that is the word i would use to describe this weekend. 

friday night, me and bree went to a german pub with her cousin carissa. we did a meter board, which is 10 shots and 10 beers. since i had a cold (still do) i couldn't taste the alcohol, i don't know if that was good or bad. we hung out at that pub for a couple of hours and then carissa took us to a club down the street. keep in mind that carissa is only 19, so staying up until the wee hours of the morning don't really affect her. we had a couple more drinks at that club, but by about 1 am, me and bree were ready to go home. i don't remember the clubs being so hot and crowded and noisy!! i know i am getting old. we went and got a doner (yummy german sandwich) and then we went back to the club to get carissas friends. we got back to the hotel at about 3 am.it was a fun night, but not something i will be repeatinganytime in the near future.

saturday afternoon i got this horrible twingy feeling in my right ear, we tried everything from ear candles to tylonol 3 to get rid of it. then at about 2 in the morning when the guys got back from their night out, my left ear started in. i woke up sunday morning in so much pain. on the drive home it got progressivly worse and worse and WORSE! to the extent that by the time we got home i was begging scott to take me to the ER. now, in germany, you can't just drive 10 minutes and be at the ER. we had to drive almost an hour to Wurzberg to go to the military hospital. so this is what i found out. On top of the wonderful sinus infection that i have, i now have a middle ear infection in my right ear...not too painful. in my left ear, i have a middle ear infection, and external ear infection AND inflamation of the tissue around my ear drum. oh, and my ear has been oozing this nasty stuff since yesterday afternoon. I can't hear and i feel like i am talking through  darth vaders mask. so, today scott is going to see if he can get someone to drain my ear at the clinic, but who knows how that will turn out. you think the military doctors suck in the states, they are 10 times worse in a foriegn country.

so today, i am doped up on tylonol 3, motrin, amoxycillin, ear drops (that numb), and sudafed. ahhhhh, that floaty feeling is nice compared to the pain i felt yesterday. like no pain i have ever felt.

i haven't talked to chas or tegan all weekend, i know they have their own lives that keep them busy (so if they aren't talking to you, its because they have their own lives to worry about too), but sometimes i just miss talking to them. :(

well, i gotta go drug up, so i can get some things done.

peace."

"event","today i went to illeshime (sp) with Bree. we took ryan and bryan (yes, that gets confusing) and we went to the thrift store and to the PX there. i was looking for curtains for maddies room. we found an entire set of blues clues bed stuff at the katterbach thrift store so i was hoping to get lucky today as well...no such luck. but i did find a kids desk and some makeshift curtains. i also got a toddler learning kit from the px for $2. that will come in handy when i start my daycare!!! i also got some wime glasses for $1.25 at the PX. all in all a good day spent shopping. 

i had a kind of revelation last night. i have decided to turn my life around and actually do some good for once. since so many people view me as such a bad person, i figure there are some things that i could change. for starters, i am always talking about starting a daycare, so i got the paperwork to take the classes, and then i can start it in the states! it is something i have always wanted to do, so now i am going to. so, obviously means there are a few other things that i have already quit, but just now i won't be able to do them at all anymore. and that is actually ok with me. also, i have decided to gid rid of my grudges and fix my past. people say you can't change the past, but you can go and apologize for the mistakes that you have made. so, if i have wronged you (and chances are i have) then be expecting me to talk to you. i need this for my own personal growth, please listen if i come to you. you don't have to forgive me, just listen to what i have to say, and i will except criticism and comments if need be. 

well, i am exhausted, and i need to pee, so i will be back in a bit.

peace."

"event","i think some peoples definition of friendship are a bit misconstrued. you want good friends then you need to be a good friend. why don't you let everyone know how you have treated me over the past couple of weeks? you haven't been the prime example for a friend either. all the talk about who owes who what and how we are using you. how does it feel?? you tell me that i am using you, and i don't do anything for you. did you tell anyone that i practically took care of your kids for 4 months? who got them ready for school everyday, made sure that were at school everyday? who made sure alex didn't go down the street at 7 am? who fed him breakfast and kept him entertained until you got out of bed?  who pushed you everyday to get out of bed? who stayed your friend through thick and thin no matter what anyone was saying about you. who stuck up for you when you were sleeping with your best friends husband? who helped you to get out of an emotionally abusive relationship? who gave up everything in her life to travel 2500 miles across the country, going on some half assed ideas, because you needed support from a friend? 

whether you think it or not, the initial reason i came here was for you, but when we got here, you didn't want anything to do with me unless you were  reminding me of how much i owed you. which, by the way, if you would have mentioned that i was going to owe you half of a loan that you took out in your husbands name, i would have been a little more apprehensive. 

you're mad? i am not mad at all, if you think that accusing me of things that i know are not true, then be that way, i don't care. i thought we were better friends then that, but maybe it is just like EVERYONE here told me... this is the real janice, she isn't the one i saw in TX. this one is just like scott, selfish and spoiled and jealous about stupid shit. 

Friends talk things out, and come to a rational  decision about things. they don't call each other names and make each other feel like the past year has been a lie a totally different person than they thought they knew."

I LOVE IT!! it has a garage, and a fenced in backyard with 2 rock BBQ's built into the wall. the kitchen has a RED tile floor...RED!!! then it has a double oven stove built into the wall with stones all around it. the living room had a huge window seat and a fireplace. it has 3 little bedrooms, but they are really cute. then we have a cute little entrance way and a breakfast nook backporch. it is everything that i have ever wanted in an apartment. 

today i took maddie to church. not something that i would normally do, but i thought i would be openminded and give it a chance...boy was i wrong. the whole time i felt like i was being brainwashed. not pressured so much as just bothered by some of their beliefs. i just can't believe in something like that. i never have been able to, i don't think i can start now.

"event","well, yesterday was Maddies first day of first grade. she loves her teacher, and loves the fact that she made ""a hundred friends"" yesterday. this morning she was up at 630 getting ready for school. *sniff*, my little girl is getting so big.

also yesterday, i went to the ACS and got a food loan because i am broke beyond belief. then we went to WIC where they said that i had to have my old wic card and i had forgotton it, so they couldn't do anything. I miss the vouchers. then i came home and called my dad, and he said my mom is doing much better, they put her on more meds. (no surprise).

well i guess it is time to talk about the inevitable...me and scott have decided to call it quits. we both know that we are great parents and good friends, we just don't work as a married couple. we share different views on a lot of things, and we figure that it will be better this way. we are going to have joint custody of the kids, and hopefully we can pull this off without killing each other!

now for me, i am hoping that the brief peek into depression was just a peek. i feel better today, despite a slight ""girl problem""! also, i just realized that it can't get any worse so it has to get better. i am a little bugged that my (ex) husband already has a girlfriend, but what can i say?

last night at about 1030 janice knocked on my window and said ""your car has been moved"". now for those of you that pay attention to my LJ, i lost my keys about a month ago, and i never got new ones made. my car was moved about 10 feet to the right and the inside light was left on. so, i know that someone has my keys, someone in this neighborhood. i am only slightly freaked out...okay, a lot. the MP's said that they really couldn't do too much, because it wasn't stolen. SOMEONE MOVED IT! they just said to watch it and see if i could catch them...oh wait till i catch them!

well, that is all for now, i have ALLOT ( :) ) of stuff i have to get done today.

"event","BITCHOLOGY 
When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch.

When I stand up for those I love, they call me a bitch.

When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do things my own way, they call me a bitch.

Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.

When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I am defined as a bitch.

The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish. 


It means I have the courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone else's idea of what they think I ""should"" be. 


I am outspoken, opinionated and determined. I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!


So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold within me. You won't succeed.


And if that makes me a bitch, so be it. I embrace the title and am proud to bear it."

"event","i am learning that everyday things change, whether for the good or the bad. you never know whats going to happen when you wake up in the morning. right now i am at a place that i don't even want to get up in the morning. i lay in bed as long as possible, and just think about the shit that is my life. if it wasn't for ryan and maddie, i don't know what i would do. i would probably still be in bed. 

things are weird around here. maybe i am just overly stressed about stupid shit that really has no significance. its not that i don't want to listen to anyone elses problems, its just that i have so much of my own stress, its hard to stop and put someone elses in there too. i know that i am being selfish and stubborn, and i apologize to everyone for that. i know this must sound like one of those ""pity post"", sorry again.

so, someone is talking to my husband about me. saying things that are not entirely true. i am a little curious as to who it is. i wish that person would just tell me. ya know, be truthful. it doesn't really matter to me, its not you are telling him anything that i wasn't already going to tell him. just make sure when you tell him things, that you have your facts straight, because you are causing a lot of unnecassary drama. he gets mad about things he hears and then yells at me for something that was just misunderstood...for example...i never said that i was going to NY with janice, i said that it had been talked about and that i didn't know yet what i was going to do. and whoever tolded him said that I WAS going for sure. i don't care, really. just get your facts straight.

well, i hope everyone else is having a good day. got lots of stuff to do, so i guess i write more later.

It's easy to find fault, but not so easy to admit it. Or is it? If you've got someone that you need to say you're sorry to, do it now before the situation progresses any further. It's surprisingly easy to kiss and make up."

"event","i have decided to quit smoking, or at least cut back a little. My motivation is on a downward spiral and i hate it. I know that i have felt like shit lately because all i wanna do is sleep and smoke. or vice versa. they say that it isn't addictive, but i think that at least it is mentally addictive. i feel like i need it to wind down, or just deal with the everyday bullshit, but i know that i don't need it and possibly would do much better everyday without the ""horse"". everyone who does it knows what i am talking about. I don't mind it at night because all i do is hang out and then go to bed, can't mess that up now can I??

everyone in the neighborhood is doing so good. we are all getting along so well. I love it. the kids are even happy! 

janice is passed out on my loveseat, she is going through what i have been going through. she just doesn't feel good, and really doesn't know why. I told her that it is probably just anxiety and being overwhelmed with all that is going on. i know how it feels to not even wanna talk or be awake, almost like i was feeling depressed, but not too sure as to why i was feeling depressed. it sucks, and it comes and goes.

well, i need to go and clean my house, because i am the only one that HAS to. i love it when other people help me, but i always feel weird when someone else is doing it. Then i feel obligated to return the favor in some way. maybe i will just throw away all of the crap that i don't need, get rid of all the extra clothes and baby junk, and just start over. sounds good to me.

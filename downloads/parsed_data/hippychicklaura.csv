"event","HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!I have had an entire 2 and a half hours sleep but im surprisingly awake!!! "" I remember feeling low, I remember losing hope and I remember all the feelings and the day they stopped...we are all innocent"" - Innocent by Our Lady Peace...sums up my day...Sam is ignoring me...the giving up men thing is really working!!!shame i'm not sticking to the be happy and bouncey thing...it's surprisingly difficult to remain coherant when your brain isnt working. I forgot how hard it was to adapt to change...especially when the change is in one of your best friends...madness! I should have been reincarnated as a raspberry..my life would have been so much simpler! oh well! 3 days and back to school!hitting the grindstone again!"

"event","Well what fun! new year, new life!In true Bridget Jones style i'm going to see how a diary will help!I will give up alcohol (for a while)(maybe)(hmm)...don't need to give up cigarettes because they're are wrong!and well, men...what can i say...I think I've been burnt enough this last month to put me off men forever (or untill some nice lad makes me feel better)(unlikely)(oh well). This year i predict more mini skirts will be worn, more fun will be had and more hearts will be broken!(hopefully not mine)...more chocolate will be consumed...more weight will be put on then lost...umm less money will be spent...will finally get that job i promised i'd get months ago and will stop frittering away my time when i really should be revising! and on that note i will vanish...never to be seen, heard or...um...smelt (i smell nice..honest) again...well ok untill 2morrow!"

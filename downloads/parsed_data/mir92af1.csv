Just wrote a summary for my book...4 pages. It was going to be a lot longer but I was like, I don't feel like typing all this so I cut to the end and in smaller font wrote out the murder mystery and who killed who. I still have to add a list of forensic evidence and something else, so it should be somewhere around 10 pages...yay!

This morning me and Mirza were supposed to be at school at 11:00. Neither of us went, and Kim called a little past 1:00 and was really pissed we didn't come because no one knows how to do the transmissions or the drive systems, or the chassis or anything that needs to be screwed together, hammered, oiled, or anything else that needs a tool. So we went at like 2 something...too bad for them. We did everything slowly and were done by 4:00, Mirza did his homework and we watched the game while we were there. Fun!

Me and Shellie were supposed to go to a show tonight, but my parents decided to make new plans 10 minutes in advance and there was a family party at my house, so I couldn't get out of the driveway and I couldn't go...she was not very happy, but she got a ride from someone else anyways :/  Sucks I couldn't go, I wanted to. 

Tomorrow is a day to say ""adios"" to my brother...he's going back :( So soon. Then type up the rest of that report, and that's it, I don't want to do any other homework or study for midterms...becasue I never do. :) 

Thanks for reading buster! :)"

"event","Late to school, which started my day off really good. Odd how that worked but it did. Got some of my grades back, not surprised, doing good A's B's and a C+ in AP Physics, but that will go up by the end of this week because I'll do some of the homework. 

Making the transmission for the robot tonight. Then as soon as I finish I'm going to the volleyball game. HA! Tomorrow should go by fast and be kind of easy, I'm thinking, yeah.

I'm stuffed."

"event","*sigh* Where to start?

Basically this week was without much time to do anything else, so sorry to everyone that called and wanted to hang out and I couldn't. Maybe this week guys. :) 

So, wednesday went pretty good, i got to the presentation and the adult leader of our team was just like, ""Mir, here are some more things for you to talk about"". Great, so I did pretty good except I looked at one of the slides that was new and couldn't think of what to say, so I made something up after 5 seconds of dead silence. After the President of the company complimented me on my good job and everyone else too. Yeah, so we got our first corporate sponsor. Yay! 

Thursday was really funny. Justin came and picked me up and we drove into Fairport for a volleyball game. We got there and there was this stupid girl who couldn't parallel park and after she tried for a few minutes she quit and her car was sticking out into traffic, she just got out and walked inside and we started laughing so hard, it was quite possibly the dumbest thing we have ever seen. The game was pretty good, Penfield kicked ass. Like always, 10-0 after that one. :)

Friday turned out kind of weird. School was terrible and the whole day I was getting text messages and voice mails and my phone makes sounds even if the ringer is off...so everyone was looking at me and I was just like, it's not me, IT'S THE PHONE!!! School got out and I took off to Marketplace, went shopping. I walked into Abercrombie and I saw this shirt, really liked it and i decided to buy it. Right then Rosie calls me and I can't hear her because of the loud music so I walk out without paying and the alram went off! I hung up on her and walked back in like nothing happened and these two girls are standing there looking at me like ""what the hell?"" Yeah, so I paid and got out really fast. Anyways, around 7 I went and picked Shellie up, talked with her dad while she was finishing getting ready and her dad is a really nice guy, to me at least. Right after we drove down the to the next neighborhood and picked up Mirza and Carl. Then off to the show. We got to the show, couldn't find a parking spot so we paid and then walked over the bridge to where all the action was. Shellie said some things I wish she hadn't but I forgive her. Everyone from Penfield was there, so I talked to them and Tori asked me to go to the game I just got back from! Penfield girls varsity volleyball stands at 11-0. Awesome game. Back to Friday, after all that we dropped Mirza off and Carl, then me and Shellie drove to Justin's house and she made me play poker...I don't like to play anymore, it's not fun for me, I win every game that I play. Well I knocked out two guys on the first hand. Then Mike got out so he gave me a dollar and I gave him 10 chips so he could stay in. It was getting late, and at 12 I sold my chips to some other kid and walked out winning money even though I didn't finish the game. Drove Shellie home and then stayed up late talking with her online, she's one of the best people to talk to. She really understands what I'm saying, not everyone does and that's cool. 

Today. Woke up a few times to turn the alarm off and then woke up late. I got ready really fast and Eugene brought Mirza over. We drove to the high school on the bad roads, then drove to RMSC. That was all good, the kickoff and all. We got back to PHS around 1:30ish after 4 1/2 hours. Then we did massive brain storming for the competitions. We also got a 100 page book on the rules of the game! I hate that. Anyways that was the end of this week. Tomorrow is just a day to hang out with my brother before he goes back because I have hardly seen him. 

It's so hard to tell some people some things."

"event","I'm going to be really busy this week...kind of sucks...but it's far better then being bored. Got back into the swing of school today. But what the hell? I got homework in gym class! Unbelievable.

Anyways, this is what's going down this week

-Today- Shopping...then a meeting tonight.
-Tuesday- Fundraisers and a meeting.
-Wednesday- Dressing up really fancy in suit and tie and running off to VIDEK, for a panel interview type of thing. Not nervous yet :)
-Thursday- Some girl asked Justin to a volleyball game at Fairport, So i'm going with him. Want to join us?
-Friday- Battle of the Bands at Waterstreet Music Hall, I have tickets if you want to go...FREE. 
-Saturday- 9AM at PHS, then off to the RMSC(Rochester Museum and Science Center) for the FIRST kickoff...then back to school until 5PM. I'm not really looking forward to a whole day of that, but it might be fun.

I still have a few hours between all that stuff, because i'll skip all the homework this week. So if you want to do something let me know. I'll see if I can make time. 

P.S. The new speech teacher is weird. Alot of kids in our class think he's gay. I don't really, but we'll see...we should set him up with Mr.Krueger, haha what a blast that would be!"

~Anyways...when I got home my pupils were the size of small watermelons and I couldn't see anything, but shellie called me and we were supposed to hang out at 4:30. She wasn't ready and so it got pushed back to 6:00. I was running late, anyways...we went shopping at marketplace for like two and a half hours and she got lots of nice things. Lucky girl. Next we headed over to the movies and saw ""meet the fockers"". Good movie. Fun laughs. Awesome time. So...that was all yesterday and now I'm off to bed. Later beloved readers.~ 

Oh...right when we got to the movies an old friend calls. Anyone know what's up?"

"event","Well because you see a post here, means the Dolphins won...indeed they did, 10-7 over the Browns. Good game, with lots of terrible plays that neither side utilized. So my team stands at 4-11, and I stand next to them. 

I stayed up until two in the morning watching the election kick off...and then woke up really early to go shopping. When I got home I cleaned my room(yes, voluntarily), and watched more of the election...and this totally rules that my candidate won! Makes me feel so good...even though I had nothing to do with it, I can't even vote in this country, nonetheless in a cool European one. Anyways...were orange tomorrow! 

Okay, I have to go to the doc's tomorrow...like always this is fun. Blah. 

After, :)  Well...Hanging out with someone special. Oh yeah!"

"event","Got op for school this morning, and dressed up really fancy. Got to school and everyone was commenting on how I looked so damn good, that was fun, and then speech class we just talked the whole class because no one cares what the teacher has to say. After my first class I got picked up and along with my mom, dad, grandparents and my brother. The funeral was really different this time. I tried to hold all my feelings in but when my dad got emotional I did too, just because I know how much this hurts him, and my mom too. After standing out in the rain and when the casket was lowered we were invited to a banquet, because she loved to host anyone for any reason, and that's what she asked for before she died. We couldn't go. I was kind of upset but I guess we all had good reasons for not going. 

When I got home...a package lay upon my bed, so I read the outside and immediately I knew I got into RIT! Indeed it was, and it's made me really happy! 

Atop all that, I have lots of homework and I missed the notes that are going to help me do them...oh well, common sense can solve any problem."

"event","School was really slow today and I accomplished absolutely nothing. Basically it was a waste of time. Anyways, on another note, sitting here looking at the list of places I still have to call, It's amazing how much I have to do in one night, but it can be done. 

Miami Dolphins raped the Patriots...hell yeah!

Funeral tomorrow :(                        
       So please give me some room."

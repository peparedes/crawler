"event","I'm giving serious thought to transferring after this semester. The only things I would feel bad about is leaving my staff one person short, and leaving Daniel behind.

I figured out why I sleep all the time. When I sleep, I don't have to deal with things. I don't have to deal with myself, and I don't have to deal with other people. I can just lay there with my eyes closed, and as long as they are closed, nothing else exists.

I need new friends. I'm sick of always being number 3. I'm sick of being the odd man out on everything, and having that be a reason for them to gang up on me. I hate thinking one thing about someone, then having them tell me that its wrong, its always been wrong, and they never said it wasn't, just because they changed their mind. I'm sick of being around people who can't hold an opinion. 

I'm sick of hating myself. I don't hate myself because of who I am, I hate myself because of who they make me be. I feel forced into a role around them. I was going through some things when I met them, so I was acting a certain way, and they assume thats who I always am. I'm not.

Things I am not:

Tough
Sure of myself
Funny
Smart
Adaptable
Liberal
Original
Alive
Happy

I am a copy of a copy of a copy, and the original was lost a long time ago. I've only met a handful of genuine people in my life, and only 2 of them still speak to me. I refuse to surround myself with poisonous people. I need out."

"event","So here I am, sitting in the staff office on duty, and I was just reading through people's Xangas, and I realized I haven't posted anything real on LJ in like forever. I know that most of you only know one of me, you either know the school me, or the home me. So, I am going to indulge a little about myself in both situations.

The home me:

Wow, this is a tough one, because I've changed so much since high school. Through most of high school, I hung out with a very small, very close group of friends, and didn't have much to do with anyone else. I spent a lot of time driving around with them, going to school, and being bored. I was extremely unambitious, and didn't like being around a lot of people. Then, my senior year, something happened and my world was ripped apart. I started broadening my group of friends, hanging out with Jillian, Ariel, Fobert, and other such people. I made it through my senior year surrounding myself with people that I could keep my distance from, and without too many tears. 

I spent most of my summer after high school being bored, and trying to learn to be normal. Obviously, that endeavor failed. This past summer, I worked my butt off, and clung to Jillian like there was no tomorrow. That's a big difference between me there and me here: there I have someone that I am comfortable with, and here, I really don't. 

Hobbies at home:

Being a good little student
Working my ass off
Trying to blend in
Being calm
Being bored
Seeing random movies with Paul
Buying way too many hair magazines
Shopping
Getting lost with Jillian
Avoiding my dad
Spending too much time at Target
Needing someone

I miss a lot of things about the person I am at home. When I am home, I am much calmer, much more reflective and tranquil. I think things through a lot better, and my temper doesn't flair out as much. At home, I am sad. 

Things I miss from home:

My cats
Mommy
Rico Suave
Meditating
Driving... just driving
Being lost
Sleeping on the kitchen floor
Feeling like someone would care about me if I wanted them to
Jillian
Outdoor School
My bath tub
Being a leader of something
Being happy
Being sad
Being anything
Paul
Not depending on my cell phone
Feeling comfortable in my own skin
Being cold
My sexy russian
Walking in the rain
Ariel, Fobert, Shaun, Amber, Swany, and all the pubs people
Being involved
Extra curriculars
Carola
Wearing pjs 24/7


I'll post some pictures from home a little later, and I'll post a bit about the me here. I think that if anyone came to visit me here, you would be very surprised at how I act. More later."

"event","1. What does your LJ nickname mean? No idea, but like 3 years after I made it, the phrase appeared on Donnie Darko.
2. Elaborate on your icon photo? I like it.
3. Did you lie about your age anywhere on the net? Probably, I don't know.
4. How many LJ friends do you have? 42
5. What is your current status? Taken
6. Do you think pregnant women are beautiful? Yeah, especially short ones
7. What is life to you? I'm in classes to figure that out
8. What is love to you? If I knew that, I wouldn't be questioning
9. What kind of people do you hate most? People who judge before they know the situation.
10. What type of people do you like most? Friendly, funny, and accepting people.
11. What makes you happy? Amy, Shannon, Daniel, Stef, Katie, my other friends here, my friends at home, my kitties, Daniel's kitties, gay marriage, Rico Suave, my soon to be pet lizard Elvis, my bath tub, thunder storms, walking around trying to find Brownies, foam parties, Rainbow Alliance, sleeping, new piercings, hot piercers, boys, girls, Guinness (Timmy G.'s adorable dog), email from Huff, Carola cheering me up, Paul, geek glasses, monkey pens, orange juice, letters, ODS, little kids, autistic people... the list goes on and on

"event","This has been posted by several people, and I just want to respond to it, because I believe most of it is absolutely crap. Comments after each one. This was posted on MySpace first.



1 . Tell her she is beautiful, not hot - (Girls shouldn't need to be told they are beautiful, they should just know it, because all girls are. Even so, guys need to be told they are cute too. This isn't one sided, and I hate that most girls think it is.)

2 . Hold her hand at any moment even if it just for a second. - (This doesn't work for everyone. Some people don't like closeness, having their bubble invaded, or doing anything in public. Just know who you're with and know what they like.)

3 . Kiss her on the forehead. - (Guys like it too, just don't make it feel like a parent.)

4 . Leave her voice messages to wake up to. - (A voicemail is good, but notes on the mirror are better, and this goes both ways.)

5 . Always tell her how beautiful she is, no matter what she's wearing. - (If you say it too much, we know you're lying. Sometimes we look like shit, and we know it, so don't try to play it off like we're gorgeous, just don't comment unless she asks.)

6 . When she is upset hold her tight and tell her how much
she means to you. - (Holding doesn't always work. Listening is number one, and guys need this too. If you just hold and tell how much they mean to you, they know you aren't listening to a damn thing they say.)

7 . Recognize the small things . . . THEY USUALLY MEAN THE MOST! - (This one is true. But don't think that it doesn't go for guys as well.)

8 . Call her baby. - (Not always. Pet names tend to piss some people off, and the name ""baby"" can be demeaning.)

9 . Sing to her no matter how horrible your voice is. - (I agree to this one personally, but I'm sure there's some girls out there that don't want to hear someone screech and crack.)

10 . Pick her over all the other girls you hang out with. - (Sometimes you need to hang with other females, and we get that, just don't do it all the time. Girls, this goes for guys too.(

11 . Write her notes. - (Goes for guys too.)

12 . Introduce her to family and friends as your girlfriend. - (This is fine, as long as its agreed upon, and its not every five seconds. It gets old after a while, so switch up the language.)

13 . Play with her hair. - (This one I hate. I love having my hair played with, but not as much as I like playing with guys'. And if the hair is done up for a special occassion, you touch it and you'll get your hand bitton off.)

14 . Pick her up, tickle her and play-wrestle with her. (I HATE BEING PICKED UP! Some girls have bubbles and don't want to be messed with. I personally don't mind the other two, just know the girl.)

15 . Sit in the park and just talk to her. - (Why the park? Why not the bedroom, the car, anywhere? Communication is crucial, no matter where it is.)

16 . Tell her funny jokes, tell her stupid jokes, just tell her jokes. - (I personally don't like jokes. Stories are better.)

17 . Throw pebbles at her window in the middle of the night just because you missed her. - (You break my window, and I'll be pissed. Calling, coming over, anything is fine, but it does go both ways, just be reasonable about it. I would hate a guy to do that if I had a major test or something the next day. Be considerate, and girls can do it for guys too.)

18 . Let her fall asleep in your arms. - (Goes both ways, both genders tend to like being held.)

19 . Carve your names into a Tree. - (This one is the worst to me. First of all, why are you hurting a tree? By carving into its bark, you are not only injuring the tree and giving it a scar that it didn't ask for, but you are assuming that the relationship is as permanent as the tree. I like to talk about the future, but nothing is set in stone, so why do something that makes it seem like it is, and being an environmentalist, why hurt a tree?)

20 . If she's mad at you, apologize because SHE is always right. - (So not true. Girls aren't always right. Take it on a situational basis. I don't respect a guy who will apologize after a fight just to end it. If I'm wrong, I'll apologize, don't do it for me.)

21 . CUDDLE - (Agreed. But just like you, we want space sometimes too.)

22 . Bring her Flowers just because. - (Where did this bullshit come from? By bringing flowers, you are killing a being for no purpose. I don't want anyone to kill flowers to bring them to me, and I have allergies. Find something better, not jewelry or anything, but a quick note, or a burned cd, or something is nice. And it goes both ways. Guys like getting surprises too.)

23 . Treat her the same around your friends as you do when
you're alone. - (Goes both ways. Girls don't like to be used as trophies, and neither do guys.)

24 . Look her in the eyes and smile. - (Smiling can ruin the moment. If you're lost there, which happens, don't force a smile.)

25 . Let her take as many pictures of you as she wants. - (Guys, this should be the same for you. If guys want to take pictures when you look like shit, let them.)

26 . Slow dance with her, even if there isn't any music playing. - (Agreed, but you don't have to intiate it, she can sometimes.)

27 . Kiss her in the rain. - (Agreed.)

28 . If your in love with her . . . Tell her - (Just don't scare her with it. Girls shouldn't either. If its not that far yet, and it doesn't feel right, hold it till it does.)"

For some reason, everyone around me seems to think that I can take insults. They think things like being playfully called a bitch, or snubbed, or picked on rolls right off my back. People seem to think that nothing phases me. That words that hurt other people don't hurt me. I guess I don't appear to be sensetive.

Newsflash: I'm a lot more sensetive than that. I'm actually more sensetive than most people. I've put up with a lot of shit in my life, and I reached my tolerance level a long time ago. Everything people say hurts. Simple stupid jokes hurt.

"event","You know what I hate?

I hate it when people talk behind your back. If they don't like you, if they are mad at you, if they have something mean to say about you, they need to say it to your face or keep it to themselves. Talking shit about people is mostly just a scream for attention and a way of showing personal insecurities.

I hate it when people act a certain way towards you when it's a one on one conversation, but completely change when other people are around. I hate it when you turn into the victim of stupid mean jokes, or name calling when others are around. People shouldn't put other people down to impress their friends, or to build a connection.

I hate backstabbers. More than anything, I hate friends that use you as a personal target when other people are around."

"event","I had the most amazing class today. We began discussing how we create our own existence, and how without a name, something fails to exist. Things that have been in my head for years came out today, and made at least a little bit of sense. 

I'm having trouble letting go of my preconcieved notions about the definition of communication. I take communication to be verbal, nonverbal, conscious, subconscious, any way of expressing something, whether another person accknowledges it or. Chad is trying to get us to step out of that definition and think of communication as simply a connection with someone, or even just with yourself.

He has a good point. If we think of every daily interaction as communication, then what do we consider those rare, special real encounters to be? Those times when you look at someone, or speak to someone, and you're both on the same plane of existence, and you just feel that person. 

Even without another person. Those moments of mindlessly complete clarity. Those times when you are just in the zone. That's communication. Everything else is secondary. My definition of communication has changed, and the depth at which my mind wraps around this concept is incredible. 

Words can't do justice to how I feel right now. These things that have been trapped inside my head since middle school, these theories that I felt were too far for the outside world to grasp are coming up and being challenged in a classroom setting. I feel liberated. I feel alive. I feel... I just feel. That's an amazing feeling. I don't remember the last time when I felt anything."

You are tolerant, accepting, and willing to give anyone a chance.
On the flip side, you're easy to read and easily influenced by others.
You have a fresh perspective on life, and you can be very creative.
Noconformist and nontraditional, you've never met anyone who's like you.

Inventive and artistic, you like to be a trendsetter.
You have an upbeat spirit and you like almost everything.
You make friends easily and often have long standing friendships.
Implusive and trusting, you fall in love a little too easily.

I want to see everybody! This means people from NM, people that have gradutated, people from other schools, and any other random person you guys can come up with! I just have a couple requests.

1 - Please nobody that I haven't at least met before (exceptions if you talk to me about it first).

2 - Bring a significant other if you'd like, assuming that I know them, but please no heavy make out scenes or anything that is likely to make me throw up my fries.

3 - Don't let other people that might be there stop you from coming (this means you, Mandi and Ariel! You can sit at opposite ends of the table, but I want to see both of you!).

Also, if you need a ride, I have some empty seats in my car, so either call me or email me or leave a comment, or just get ahold of Carol, and we'll make sure you get there if you want to go. If you want to come, but will be late, let me knows and I'll make sure Carol knows, since she is sort of dealing with the whole thing.

Yay! I'm so excited to see everybody!"

britt is glowing, really. her and i have been tight since 8th grade. she was the only ""preppy"" girl that i REALLY got along with and never have to be fake with.

i like how i was so upset about my mom that i cried and the second cody talked to me, i got instantly happy. love? i think so. i also love how he wrote about me in his english journal and when he wrote an essay about a person he loves he wrote about me :) enough with the mushy stuff that you are hating me for.

on saturday cody and i are going to homecoming with sean palowski! he and i were best friends in elementary school and i'm excited. we are also meeting up with evan at the olive garden. its cute that sean and cody are basically taking care of everything. on wednesday i was so worried about who we were even GOING with and then cody called and told me we were going with sean and that they already made restaurant reservations. all i know is that cody will look handsome and i'm excited to dress up.

i wrote a note to my english teacher and left it on her desk because she got upset today about how disrespectful some of the kids in my class are to her. she is my favorite teacher of all time and she said ""i'm so sick of caring so much about you guys and no one caring back"" that makes me sad. it's her first year teaching and she always tells cody and i that we have ""cool hair"" and that we are cute. she is so nice! well, i don't want her to become one of those old cynical sarcastic teachers because she is to cool for that. my note simply said;

mrs. steer-
i care about you!

i love my boyfriend, but i hate his smoking habit. i dont think he knows that im allergic to cigarette smoke but i figure it's to late to tell him because he will think its a silly excuse for me to make him quit smoking. besides, he is way to cute to me smoking. its smelly and he has way to nice of a complexion to me messing with cancer demons. 

anyways! at approximately 9.00 terry came and picked us up and they smoked the whole time and my eyes burned the whole time. we went and picked tyler up after work at steak and shake and he had a red bow tie on. we drove to tyler's and then we ate wendy's. i really wish i could have actually kissed cody when i got out of the car but that stale smoke smell kind of repulses me. 

i used to be so motivated in school. now, its like i'm the definition of a procrastinator. i wish i knew what my problem was. i feel like an idiot. the only stuff i actually absorb is history. and i don't want to be a historian. and i sleep all the time. i nod off constantly and every time i do i get a headache. i bet i have some sort of cancer or i need to start exercising like the doctor told me to do. but then my immense procrastination kicks in."

i love looking threw all of his old photographs from when he lived overseas. those particular pictures are from his stay in england in 1952. i love to think of what he was saying the person with him who took those pictures some 50 years ago. does that person remember my grandpa fondly? are they even alive anymore? i like to think of the conversations he had and all the people who he befriended. he was very friendly. anywhere he went he had some sort of companion. my grandpa was a drill sargent in the army. it's funny to look at those pictures and imagine him yelling at a group of 18 year olds in some foreign country. he never acted or spoke to me like a drill sargent. i read the letters he wrote to my grandma when they were courting. he was such a romantic guy. the way he wrote and spoke to her was like 'the notebook' type of love. he was also extremely handsome. just look at him! he was gorgeous. but i imagine him in england at the lad's club in manchester drinking coffee and reading to kill a mocking bird and smoking a ciggarrette. my grandpa was a very smart guy, too. i'm not just saying that either. he knew all about religions and never disrespected anyone for their views. he taught me how to ride a two wheel bike one summer and didnt give up on me. he taught me how to read and how to respect people. we used to take long long drives all around michigan with his black lab happy in the middle of us in his white pickup truck and he told me about the places he had been and the people he had met and he told me about the real world, he didnt hold anything back from me. i appreciate, now more than ever, that he treated me like i was a grown up. i cant really explain how much resentment i held against him when he died. i lost my best friend and the only person (besides my dad) who really understood me. you know? but i'm okay now and it doesnt hurt like it used to, i just really wish i would have told him everything he did for me and how much i appreciate everything he gave me.

HELLO, IS YOUR BRAIN OPERATING? he is a construction project superintendent, he needs STEEL-TOED BOOTS, not skechers. he is so cheap. and last night we went to the irish pub with his parents who were 2 hours late, we have a 9 month old baby, he cannot sit in a restaurant for 4 hours and then expected to be in a good mood. they arrived and for a birthday present they gave him a 25 dollar book store certificate, fuck that. they didnt even buy him dinner. i hate that family. sorry this just turned into a rant of sorts."

my stepdad's mom is going to be getting a kidney taken out tomorrow so i get to spend the remander of my summer vacation sitting in a waiting room, acting nervous, and making up stories in my head. i do not like hospitals, they smell like urine and meatloaf and i always think people are dying around me. besides, everyone is slightly overreacting about her kidney. it is a common procedure and the doctor said/promised that there would be no complications. im surprised, however, that we havent gone coffin shopping for untimely death. 

i dont really like going up north anymore. it isnt as exciting as it used to be. i did flip my stepdad off of the wave runner this weekend which was an amazing experience because im the one usually tumbling off of the back end. 

i'm coming home tuesday night, i have wednesday to gobble up as much freedom as i can possibly muster. but i bet cody will come over before work and i will just end up talking on the phone with someone until 9pm when i will attempt to go to bed. and then thursday i have to wake up at 6.30 in the morning and go learn spanish.

excuse the fact that i hardly ever make sense, but i havent had much human contact with kids my own age in four days."

im going to be up in michigan this weekend till sunday because im going to a wedding way up there and i will miss you all, really.

i went to see my counselor today to drop my spanish 2 class, when i couldnt get photography with cody i decided just to make that class a pass/fail class and work really hard to make it a real grade. im going to be getting a tutor, books, and an interactive cd-rom to help me threw it. 


<lj-cut text=""my homeless uncle in new mexico just sent me a letter."">

he calls me veronica. i'm going to quote him now; 

""there are a lot of crackheads and methamphetamine heads here. the only two things i do are vodka and a little bit of pot. (boy have pot prices gone up!) i've been kicked out of st. martins (shelter) by a jewish lesbian from NY. (she hates men) no great loss though, after 7 years, i was getting bored with it. (occupational burnout). i can still get my mail at st. martins. i have spies and accomplices there- they dont like laurie the lesbian either. just remember your big bubby is protected and surrounded by angels. (to survive the crap i've been through i have to be protected and surrounded by something greater than i.)""

i really like when my uncle kevin writes, he has an extremely refreshing view on life.

but, i do thank him for not making me feel stupid in the car when i cried, i havent done that since my grandpa was alive. i thank him for not making me feel awkward and unimportant and i thank him for giving me reassuring words, even if he didnt mean them. i'm glad that i am not upset at him, because i never could be. i'm not mad or bitter because i have (well placed?) hope that his mind will untangle itself and that it is going to be okay soon.

please, friends, do not think that i am being naive when i say those things. there is so much more that has been said, and i never place hope on anything i dont think deserves it."

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v327/astronott/kelly.jpg"">
so, r kellys series of songs ""trapped in the closet"" has been confusing me so i decided to listen to each song, and figure it all out.

<lj-cut text=""pt 1-5!"">
<p align=center>
chapter one; r. kelly was at the club, slept with a lady, woke up at her house, tried to leave, lady's husband came home, and since they are on the fifth floor and crawling out the window that wouldn't be very smart so he HIDES IN THE CLOSET (this sort of surprised me, i thought he was a homosexual), then his cellphone rings (he tried putting it on vibrate)! and the husband hears it and then finds r kelly in the closet...

chapter two; guy admits that lady is a ho and that he should have known better, but the christian in him gave him faith in her, r kelly explains that the lady chose him, he didnt choose the lady at the club, and i guess r kelly is holding a gun because the man says something like ""id kill you if you didnt have that gun in your hand"" (btw; the man in a pastor), r kelly wants to handle this christian-like, THEN, THE PASTOR THROWS A CURVE BALL! HE TOO HAS A LOVER!, he calls his lover to come over, OMFG THE LOVER IS A MAN!!!!!!!!!....

chapter three; r, kelly wants to leave, he is uncomfortable with gay people, the married couple argues about lying and stuff, the male lover starts to get detailed, r. kelly wants the details to be spared, the lady lied about her name to r. kelly and he wants to shoot somebody, the pastor says that him and his lover are in love and they want to get married! r. kelly shoots a bullet into the air, then r. kelly calls home, and a man answers the phone... 

chapter four; he dashes home doin' 85mph, of course his mind is also going 85 mph because why is a man answering the phone, of course r kelly is going 85mph in a 60mph zone and gets pulled over by a police officer, tries saying that there is an emergency, the police officer doesn't want to hear excuses, after the police officer leaves he goes 55mph all the way home, he busts up in the house and realized, much to his dismay, that the man that answered the phone was his wife's brother, r kelly feels very stupid for this, she says she understands why he was upset, and they go to the bedroom, they make love, it gets awfully provocative for about a minute, she talks about climaxing, r kelly gets a leg cramp, after all of that messy business, he pulls back the covers and finds a rubber....

chapter five; r kelly getsupset about this and wants to light the house on fire (a bit drastic if i do say so myself), he knows a man has been in the house and he smells cigarettes, r kelly pulls out his gun and starts searching about the house, she lets him know that she knows about what he did last night, her friend tina who knows roxanna who dates chuck who is friends with rufus, rufus' wife is kathy and they went to school together who introduced her to.... THE POLICEMAN WHO PULLED R KELLY OVER!

i really cant wait for chapter 6 to this epic hip hop soap opera."

you really were a very nice camera. although you didnt zoom, but that's okay! i got so many compliments on you and how tiny you were, but you belong in camera heaven now. it was a good two years but most good things come to an end eventually. bye bye baby.

hi to you brandnew nikon coolpix4600 you and are are going to be spending a lot of time together and we will become inseparable. i like you mostly because you zoom AND a self timer, but you are kind of confusing right now and you have A LOT of buttons and gadgets but so far i'm excited for your existance.


i basically have the greatest dad in the entire world. he buys me a brandnew camera, even though he didnt need to, i was just going to ask for one for chirstmas! i'm a real lucky girl.

and then on the way home he took me to see this volkswagen cabriolet; 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v327/astronott/cabriolet.jpg""> 
we drove her around and it only costs $3500 and my dad is going to go back monday and i would be shocked if he didnt buy it. this car is damn cute. its perfect. and he really likes it and i really like it!

"event","toledo is going threw a heat wave. when i opened the door last night when dustin was leaving i swear i suffocated from the humidity, and it's only 90 out. i'm so glad that this only lasts about a month, unlike arizona or texas where its ever hotter than today all the time. 


my brother is growing so fast. he is already standing up by himself and i can barely hold him for more than five minutes at a time. it funny to think about when he was only a month old when he slept ALL the time. and now he is all over the place and laughing like a little tiny mad man. but im okay with that because i babysat him on saturday and had the time of my life.

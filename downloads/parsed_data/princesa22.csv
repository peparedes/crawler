""mi amor, la que quiero con todo mi corazon, la que adoro y pienso en cada momento, la que quiero pasar el resto de mis dias, la que llamo princesa mia, la que me trata con carino y ternura, la que me hace reir en dias de amargura, la que con sus ojos sabe mi sentir,  la que con su amor feliz hace mi diario vivir, la que pronto aceptara mi apellido, y simbolo de amor con un anillo, la que un dia futuro sera madre a mi nino, esa que por una eternidad quiero mostrarle mi carino."""

"event","One of my girlfriends sent this to me - it's a little long, but funny and sooo true!

Only a woman will TRULY relate to the following! My mother was a fanatic about public toilets. As a little girl, she'd bring me in the stall, teach me to wad up toilet paper and wipe the seat. Then, she'd carefully lay strips of toilet paper to cover the seat. Finally, she'd instruct, ""Never, never sit on a public toilet seat. And she'd demonstrate ""The Stance,"" which consisted of balancing over the toilet in a sitting position without actually letting any of your flesh make contact with the Toilet seat.  But by this time, I'd have wet down my leg and we'd go home.

That was a long time ago. Even now in our more mature years, The Stance is excruciatingly difficult to maintain when one's bladder is especially full.  When you have to ""go"" in a public bathroom, you find a line of women
that makes you think there's a half-price sale on Nelly's underwear in there.

So, you wait and smile politely at all the other ladies, also crossing their legs! and smiling politely. And you finally get closer. You check for feet under the stall doors. Every one is occupied.  Finally, a stall door opens and you dash, nearly knocking down the woman leaving the stall.. You get in to find the door won't latch. It doesn't matter. You hang your purse on the door hook, yank down your pants and assume ""The Stance."" Relief. More relief. Then your thighs begin to shake.  You'd love to sit down but you certainly hadn't taken time to wipe the seat or lay toilet paper on it, so you hold The Stance as your thighs
experience a quake that would register an eight on the Richter scale.  

To take your mind off it, you reach for the toilet paper. The toilet paper dispenser is empty. Your thighs shake more. You remember the tiny tissue that you blew your nose on-that's in your purse. It would have to do.  You crumble it in the puffiest way possible. It is still smaller than
your thumbnail.

Someone pushes open your stall do! or because the latch doesn't work and your purse whams you in the head.  ""Occupied!"" you scream as you reach out for the door, dropping your tissue in a puddle and falling backward, directly onto the toilet seat. You get up quickly, but it's too late.  Your bare bottom has made contact with all the germs and life forms on the bare seat because YOU never laid down toilet paper, not that there was
any, even if you had enough time to. And your mother would be utterly ashamed of you if she knew, because her bare bottom never touched a public toilet seat because, frankly, ""You don't know what kind of diseases you could
get.""

And by this time, the automatic sensor on the back of the toilet is so confused that it flushes, sending up a stream of water akin to a fountain and then it suddenly sucks everything down with such force that you grab onto the toilet paper dispenser for fear of being dragged to China.
At that point, you give up. You're soaked by the splashing water.

You're exhausted. You try to wipe with a Chicklet wrapper you found in your pocket, then slink out inconspicuously to the sinks. You can't figure out how to operate the sinks with the automatic sensors, so you wipe your hands with spit and a dry paper towel and walk past a line of women, still waiting, cross-legged and unable to smile politely at this point.  

One kind soul at the very end of the line points out that you are trailing a piece of toilet paper on your shoe as long as the Mississippi River!  You yank the paper from your shoe, plunk it the woman's hand and say warmly, ""Here. You might need this.""

At this time, you see your man, who has entered, used and exited his bathroom and read a copy of War and Peace while waiting for you.  ""What took you so long?"" he asks, annoyed ... This is when you kick him sharply in the shin and go home.

This is dedicated to all women everywhere who have ever had to deal with a public toilet. And it finally explains to all you men what takes us so long.  

PS - The answer to the other question, why women go in pairs? - So the other woman can hold the door and hand you Kleenex."

"event","<b>TARGET Stores</b>
by Dick Forrey of the Vietnam Veterans Association

      Recently we asked the local TARGET store to be a proud sponsor of the
      Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall during our spring recognition event.

      We received the following reply from the local TARGET management:
      ""Veterans do not meet our area of giving. We only donate to the arts,
      social action groups, gay & lesbian causes, and education.""

      So I'm thinking, if the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and veterans
      in general do not meet their donation criteria, then something is
      really wrong at this TARGET store. We were not asking for thousands
      of dollars, not even hundreds, just a small sponsorship for a
      memorial remembrance.

      As a follow-up, I e-mailed the TARGET U.S. corporate headquarters and
      their response was the same. That's their national policy.

      Then I looked into the company further. They will not allow the
      Marines to collect for 'Toys for Tots' at any of their stores. And
      during the recent Iraq deployment, they would not allow families of
      employees who were called up for active duty to continue their
      insurance coverage while they were on military service. Then as I dig
      further, TARGET is a French-owned corporation.

      Now, I'm thinking again. If TARGET can not support American Veterans,
      then why should I and my family support their stores by spending our
      hard earned American dollars and to have their profits sent to
      France. Without the American Vets, where would France be today?

      Feel free to pass this along to whomever you want.

      Sincerely,

      Dick Forrey

<B>[11]  I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there are no other cars around. That's how far ahead of me they are. </B>

[12] When the Officer says ""Gee Son ....Your eyes look red, have you been drinking?"" You probably shouldn't respond with,""Gee Officer your eyes look glazed, have you been eating donuts?"""

[17] Every vehicle you own has a ski rack or a gun rack.

[18] You can accurately judge people as to their social status by determining which Wegmans store they shop at.

[19] You can go to any mall on Saturday and see at least 5 people you either work with, went to school with or dated.

[20] The new line of spring fashions to hit the stores is actually comprised of leftovers from the 1991 line in NYC.

[21] A musical comes to town 10 years after its Broadway premiere and the entire town goes nuts! (ex. Miss Saigon)

[22] You wake up from a deep sleep, look at the clock and see that it's 6:00 but you have no idea whether it's am or pm.

[23] 18+ inches of snow falls overnight, but you never thought of NOT going to work.

[35] You can travel from Egypt to Greece in about a half hour by car. 

[36] A snow storm advisory means you must go shop at Wegmans! 

[37] Any new construction project downtown that comprises over ten stories is worthy of a detailed front-page account in the newspaper. 

[38] The temperature hits 45 degrees and the sun comes out in any month between November and April, people walk around downtown wearing shades and no jackets. 

[39] You and the cat are peacefully napping in front of the TV set, with the volume at a comfortable level, and a Gabriele Ford commercial comes on at twice the decibel level, causing you to bolt upright and the cat to leave gouge marks in your lap.

[05] When you are worried, I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining. 
[06] When you are confused, I will use little words to explain. 
[07] When you are sick, stay away from me until you're well again. I don't want whatever you have. 
[08] When you fall, I will point and laugh at your clumsy Ass. 

This is my oath, I pledge until the end. Why you may ask? 

Because you're my friend! 

Send this to ten of your closest friends and get depressed because you can only think of two, and one of them is not speaking to you right now anyway. 

Remember: A friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body. Let me know if I ever need to bring a shovel."

"event","According to studies, the first letter of your first name reveals your sexual characteristics: 

A: You are not particularly romantic, but you are interested in action. You mean business. With you, what you see is what you get. You have no patience for flirting and can't be bothered with someone who is trying to be coy, cute, demure, and subtly enticing. You are an up front person. When it comes to sex, it's action that counts not obscure hints. Your mate's physical attractiveness is important to you. You find the chase and challenge of the ""hunt"" invigorating. You are passionate and sexual as well as being much more adventurous than you appear; however, you do not go around advertising these qualities. Your physical needs are your primary concern. 

B: You give off vibes of lazy sensuality. You enjoy being romanced, wined, and dined. You are very happy to receive gifts as an expression of the affection of your lover. You want to be pampered and know how to pamper your mate. You are private in your expression of endearments and particularly when it comes to lovemaking. You will hold off until everything meets with your approval. You can control your appetite and abstain from sex if need be. You require new sensations and experiences. You are willing to experiment. 

C: You are a very social individual, and it is important to you to have a relationship. You require closeness and togetherness. You must be able to talk to your sex partner before, during, and after. You want the object of your affection to be socially acceptable and good looking. You see your lover as a friend and companion. You are very sexual and sensual, needing someone to appreciate and almost worship you. When this cannot be achieved, you have the ability to go for long periods without sexual activity. You are an expert at controlling your desires and doing without. 

D: Once you get it into your head that you want someone, you move full steam ahead in pursuit. You do not give up your quest easily. You are nurturing and caring. If someone has a problem, this turns you on. You are highly sexual, passionate, loyal, and intense in your involvement, sometimes possessive and jealous. Sex to you is a pleasure to be enjoyed. You are stimulated by the eccentric and unusual, having a free and open spirit. 

E: Your greatest need is to talk. If your date is not a good listener, you have trouble relating. A person must be intellectually stimulating or you are not interested sexually. You need a friend for a lover and a companion for a bedmate. You hate disharmony and disruption, but you do enjoy a good argument once in a while it seems to stir things up. You flirt a lot, for the challenge is more important than the sexual act for you, but once you give your heart away, you are uncompromisingly loyal. When you don't have a good lover to fall asleep with, you will fall asleep with a good book. Sometimes, in fact, you prefer a good book. 

F: You are idealistic and romantic, putting your lover on a pedestal. You look for the very best mate you can find. You are a flirt, yet once committed, you are very loyal. You are sensuous, sexual, and privately passionate. Publicly, you can be showy, extravagant, and gallant. You are born romantic. Dramatic love scenes are your favourite fantasy pastime. You can be a very generous lover. 

G: You are fastidious, seeking perfection within yourself and your lover. You respond to a lover who is your intellectual equal or superior, and one who can enhance your status. You are sensuous and know how to reach the peak of erotic stimulation, because you work at it meticulously. You can be extremely active sexually that is, when you find the time. Your duties and responsibilities take precedence over everything else. You may have difficulty getting emotionally close to a lover, but no trouble getting close sexually. 

H: You seek a mate who can enhance your reputation and earning ability. You will be very generous to your lover once you have attained a commitment. Your gifts are actually an investment in your partner. Before the commitment, though, you tend to be frugal in your spending and dating habits and equally cautious in your sexual involvement. You are a sensual and patient lover. 

I: You have a great need to be loved, appreciated ... even worshipped. You enjoy luxury, sensuality, and pleasures of the flesh. You look for lovers who know what they are doing. You are not interested in an amateur, unless that amateur wants a tutor. You are fussy and exacting about having your desires satisfied. You are willing to experiment and try new modes of sexual expression. You bore easily and thus require sexual adventure and change. You are more sensual than sexual, but you are sometimes downright lustful. 

J: You are totally f___ing marvellous! 

K: You can be very romantic, attached to the glamour of love. Having a partner is of paramount importance to you. You are free in your expression of love and are willing to take chances, try new sexual experiences, provided it's all in good taste. Brains turn you on. You must feel that your partner is intellectually stimulating, otherwise you will find it difficult to sustain the relationship. You require loving, cuddling, wining, and dining to know that you're being appreciated. 

L: You are very romantic, idealistic, and somehow you believe that to love means to suffer. You wind up serving your mate or attracting people who have unusual troubles. You see yourself as your lover's saviour. You are sincere, passionate, lustful, and dreamy. You can't help falling in love. You really enjoy stimulating yourself, though you are fairly new to it. You fantasise and get turned on by movies and magazines. You do not tell others of this secret life, nor of your sexual fantasies. You are the ideal sex machine, seducing others with mind, eyes, body and lips.

your entire being into it. Nothing stops you; there are no holds barred. You are all consuming and crave someone who is equally passionate and intense. You believe in total sexual freedom. You are willing to try anything and everything. Your supply of sexual energy is inexhaustible. You also enjoy mothering your mate. 

N: You are crap in bed. Much practice and learning is needed. 

O: You are very interested in sexual activities yet secretive and shy about your desires. You can re-channel much of your sexual energy into making money and/or seeking power. You can easily have extended periods of celibacy. You are a passionate, compassionate, sexual lover, requiring the same qualities from your mate. Sex is serious business; thus you demand intensity and diversity, and are willing to try anything or anyone. Sometimes your passions turn to possessiveness, which must be kept in check. 

P: You are very conscious of social proprieties. You wouldn't think of doing 
anything that might harm your image or reputation. Appearances count, therefore, you require a good-looking partner. You also require an intelligent partner. Oddly enough, you may view your partner as your enemy; A good fight stimulates those sex vibes. You are relatively free of sexual hang-ups. You are willing to experiment and try new ways of doing things. You are very social and sensual; you enjoy flirting and need a good deal of physical gratification. 

Q: You require constant activity and stimulation. You have tremendous physical energy. It is not easy for a partner to keep up with you, sexually or otherwise. You are an enthusiastic lover and tend to be attracted to people of other ethnic groups. You need romance, hearts and flowers, and lots of conversation to turn you on and keep you going. 

R: You are a no-nonsense, action-oriented individual. You need someone who can keep pace with you and who is your intellectual equal the smarter the better. You are turned on more quickly by a great mind than by a great body. However, physical attractiveness is very important to you. You have to be proud of your partner. You are privately very sexy, but you do not brag, you are willing to serve as teacher. Sex is important; you can be a very demanding playmate. 


S: You are secretive, self-contained, and shy. You are very sexy, sensual, and passionate, but you do not let on to this. Only in intimate privacy will this part of your nature reveal itself. When it gets down to the nitty-gritty, you are an expert. You know all the little tricks of the trade, can play any role or any game, and take your love life very seriously. You don't fool around. You have the patience to wait for the right person to come along. 

<b>T: You are very sensitive, private, and sexually passive; you like a partner who takes the lead. Music, soft lights and romantic thoughts turn you on. You fantasize, but do not tend to fall in and out of love easily. When in love, you are romantic, idealistic, mushy, and extremely intense. You enjoy having your senses and your feelings stimulated, titillated, and teased. You are a great flirt. You can make your relationships fit your dreams, oftentimes all in your own head.</b>

U: You are enthusiastic and idealistic when in love. When not in love, you are in love with love, always looking for someone to adore. You see romance as a challenge. You are a roamer and need adventure, excitement, and freedom. You deal in potential relationships. You enjoy giving gifts and enjoy seeing your mate looking good. Your sex drive is strong and you desire instant gratification. You are willing to put your partner's pleasures above your own. 

V: You are individualistic, and you need freedom, space, and excitement. You wait until you know someone well before committing yourself. Knowing someone 
means psycho-ing him out. You feel a need to get into his head to see what makes him tick. You are attracted to eccentric types. Often there is an age difference between you and your lover. You respond to danger, thrills, and suspense. The gay scene turns you on, even though you yourself may not be a participant. 

W: You are very proud, determined, and you refuse to take no for an answer when pursuing love. Your ego is at stake. You are romantic, idealistic, and often in love with love itself, not seeing your partner as he or she really is. You feel deeply and throw all of yourself into your relationships. Nothing is too good for your lover. You enjoy playing love games. 

X: You need constant stimulation because you bore quickly. You can handle more than one relationship at a time with ease. You can't shut off your mind. You talk while you make love. You can have the greatest love affairs, all by yourself, in your own head.

Y: You are sexual, sensual, and very independent. If you can't have it your 
way, you will forgo the whole thing. You want to control your relationships, which doesn't always work out too well. You respond to physical stimulation, enjoy necking and spending hours just touching, feeling and exploring. However, if you can spend your time making money, you will give up the pleasures of the flesh for the moment. You need to prove to yourself and your partner what great lover you are. You want feedback on your performance. You are an open, stimulating, romantic bedmate. 

Z: For you, it is business before pleasure. If you are in any way bothered by career, business, or money concerns, you find it very hard to relax and get into the mood. You can be romantically idealistic to a fault and are capable of much sensuality. But you never lose control of your emotions. You are very careful and cautious before you give your heart away and your body, for that matter. Once you make the commitment, though, you stick like glue."

"event","Shit kickers it's been a spell or 2 since i've thrown something in here. Well i'm only writin about the other nite/morning so..... I was lounging about the house this day with jack tripper to do. Then as a gesture of good faith, i call a friend i wasn't too happy with and decided to wish them a happy new year and belated christmas. Suddenly they're hit with the idea to invite me to a movie and a night out so i agree. I've gotten dressed as best as possible and she rushes me out of the house because she decided to pick a movie that was starting way too soon. Anyway, Lemony Snicket: Regardless of a name that patricide would've been totally justified, you did a good thing. I enjoyed the cinematic rendition of your work. After the movie, we just go cruising around and wind up near a beach where we pull over and she shows me some spot she had to run for J-lifeguards when we're soon met up by 2 gard. cops cruisin askin us questions and such. Unfortunately for my friend, not only is she a nervous wreck when he shows up, but she gets the cop who probably hasn't fucked in ages with an evil wife and a Napoleon complex. While she's being interrogated, the other cop swings around and asks me a few questions: what's in my pocket, what we're doin out there and had we been doin ne drinkin. Nice guy too. So on, we're told to go home where we venture down the street that you can never get yourself lost on and we make our way to the LBC to watch water. we cruise around more and interesting words are exchanged. Earlier that day, we'd talked about great songs to fuck to when she mentioned NIN's Closer which is like a universal favorite for anyone. Then not too long after the new year came, we heard the most sadistically genius mix of NIN's Closer mixed with 50 cent's In The Club. Whoever created that is a fucking God. Then she makes her way back to my house to drop me off. Somehow we end up in the front of my house idly sitting there talking about the past and then i go home. I've always believed that you know you had a good day when you smell like 3 things that only go together under odd circumstances. I smelled like Grande carmel frapaccino, ciggs and water coming home. All in all, that day was a good day..."

"event","I've been thinking about this for the last couple of weeks and it's just come to a pop off the cap epiphany. Aside from the current, i'd spent the prior year and 1/2 with people who haven't been able to break me. No, not the kind of leather mask, bound and gagged with a nordic-built czech woman beating me with a paddle, but make me forget everything i've learned and experienced with girls/women and just let go of my beguiling visage and be me. My problem. which is the prob. with a lot more people than one would imagine, is i've subjugated myself to getting myself acquainted with people who do less than beneficial things to my emotions and psychological fortitude. It bugs me because i seem to fall into the same cycle with the same brand of people and i either sacrifice too much of myself to seek her approval or i withhold so much of myself that when i truly unveil my inner being, it's too much for them to bare and things collapse. I've indirectly dropped someone from a major part of my existence and that actually is working out a lot more smoothly than i ever imagined, which also worries me to some degree as well. Now, i've found myself tied to someone who has their perks, but at the same time battles so many of their own issues, convictions and personal demons that it leaks from their own mind into the real world and this causes me anxiety. Obviously, this is something i never anticipated, however it's my only fault for finding myself in this mess. Some of the reoccurring habits they exhibit are 2 steps from tedious but i mean honestly, should anyone really try so hard to stick to their own story. I mean be you are, but don't go out of your way to let the world know that you are who you are when no one is challenging or contesting it to begin with.  To think i figured i'd found what i was looking for some odd months ago makes me laugh my ass off in hindsight. It'd only make sense that something so great would end up being so flawed, or was it just my mistake for overestimating the level of emotional capacity one can have without falling into the psychologically-shattered demographic that is my past ""love-life"". Never thought they'd turn out to be a scholastic version of B.J. lol. But that's in the past. Nevertheless, i'm still stuck in a quandary as to whether or not i persist on tolerating something i personally am only 74% convicted in or do i use my ever so rusty razor sharp tongue and put an end to what potentially may be one of my greatest pre-coital follies ever. Only time will tell. Luckily, i'm a patient person and know from experience that life throws a bone once in a while and answers questions like this for me. Hurry the fuck up already..."

However, my sis dropped by which was a nice surprise since i hadn't seen her since she'd been back home from the cruise she'd gone on. So her and i sat around bullshittin' til she wanted me to look at an outfit she'd wanted to buy. So her and i go out to check it out since it was being held at the place. While out, we had an assload of laughs about gay mexican beauty supply clerks and i educated her on the ""Maui Roll"". What made that easier was that there was a woman in the parking lot with the perfect example of it. Damn she was built for sex and wrestling in church, i swear. Then we made fun of a wal-mart employee who looked like he was on the verge of hitting on my sister and about to rob her at the same time and how another was ridden with hickies. After we'd gotten back home, i ended up going back out to see another friend and in the process, taught her about herself and some of the many wonders she can bring about if she tried in her life. Then i had cereal and it was the best. Days like this should happen at least once a week. Then again, i guess if they did, they wouldn't be as special."

"event","It's been a while since i've updated on my own accord, but here's a bit of the week's rundown. Well last weekend for one was prob. one of the most fun i've had in a while. Long story short, Me and my 2 other cousins (16 and 11) took my dad's truck at around 10:30 and went cruisin around and wound up at walmart where we loitered and bought a bunch of bull for the hell of it. Then after we'd left, we all chose to go to In n' Out where we got 2 double-doubles and a drink. When we finally pull up to the window, the cutest lil thing hands me my drink and says my food'll be up in a minute then she walks off. A few min later, a guy comes around and hands us the burgers. Then at random, the most inventively insane thought pops into my head so i decide to ask the guy if the gal who gave us the drink was single. So he asks her and she says yes then i ask if i could call her, so he asks her and she gives me her number. Then we drive off on our way back home, when there's a big surprise at the end. When we'd gotten to the exit to the street, i look into my hand and see the $10 i had intended to give her for the food. So overall, we'd snuck out with a truck, i'd gotten a girl's number and got free food all in the same trip. The following week wasnt too much to speak of, went to the movies and saw King Arthur with my L-gurl *muah* and went to get some food at Islands. The next day i saw Fahrenheit 9/11. Fantastic movie. i was beyond pissed by the end, but it was a good movie over all. Found out yesterday that my friend's girlfriend's cousin likes me and designated some pics specifically for me which was one very unexpected twist. Now i'm here recappin all of the weeks events and wondering what's gonna happen next. well hopefully, the next few weeks are as grand as i have them envisioned. Wish me luck, universe."

But it's just really shocking/depressing when i find out or am told that not only have they lost such innocence, but that they've completely lost any forms of morality and integrity in the process. Getting used to something like this while i'm trying to forget everything about my former self is harder than making nails stick to warm water.

My mind and emotions are deeply rooted in turmoil and i havent the slightest clue where to attempt to sort them. Mentally, ive actually found my place and am gradually breaking free of my old self and becoming the person ive been told i'd be in my 30s and so on. Ironically enough, something i've strongly wanted to hold on to while straying from the former ""me"" will end up being one of those aspects of my life ill be forced to cast off. If in the end, that is the choice that must be made, i really do hope those who are affected won't hold too heavy a grudge. I really do care and want things to work for the best in all corners. Probably one of the most influencial aspects of all of this entire experience i'm currently living is the pull of forgetting who i once was to embrace what i've created now by venturing out. Something quite meaningful to me is in my life and i want to do the best that i can to perpetuate its existance in my world. Just hope everyone i know will offer their support in helping me maintain my sanity and true self."

I've never seen this kid a day before in my life, but he's a great kid. 11 years old and so adorable and a bit of a smartass, but he plays it very very well. He was my lil buddy for those few days and he sidekicked with me. There'd be some plumbing problems and my dad sent me off to get the necessary supplies and i took my lil cuz with me. We roamed around the store and picked up supplies and it was surreal experience since i was also his mentor and answered every question he asked to the best of my abilities. Then on the way back home, i asked if he was hungry and he said yes so we made our way to taco bell which would prove to be a bit of a triff. The dude who took our order was being the most unprofessional, rude asshole on earth while he was taking our order. Then when we pull up to the window, the fucker walks away for no reason when i try to pay..so as im sitting there i'm just brewing over how much i wanna shatter his face. At a moment of true beauty; however, i idly say ""whata dick"" when immediately my lil cousin chimes in with ""head"" and gives a little grin..*sigh* Also, during the course of these past few days, i made 3 diff. breakthroughs in 3 different relationships which were some of the most substantial steps i've taken with anyone in a while.

Neway, while i was in getting myself sexi-fied, i talked to a friend whom i hadn't spoken with in a while so it was very nice to hear from her. Our conversation was cut short, but with good reason being hat my chariot had arrived. I made my way in and couldn't help but admire the 2 lovely slices of heavy i would be accompaning for the evenin. 1st, we retrieved 2 more passengers and upon making our way to the movies, decided it'd be more cost effective if we just watched a movie at one's dwelling instead. Upon the change of plans, we went to the quizno's of mexican eateries, Pachanga. I had myself a very gorgeous burrito and after, we made our way to the house to watch our feature film H.P. Such a strong feeling of honor to be used as a human comforter by a friend. Once again, good things must come to an end so after the movie, we all made our way back to our places of rest. It was a warm farewell which wasn't as heartbreaking as 1 might have expected. One of the more frightening realizations was the possibility that i'd left my phone with the others, but luckily upon closer room excavation, it was found buried beneath a pile of clothes...*MUAH* ty L-girl for making what would've been a humdrum boring day an ever so wonderful one to remember.

The past few weeks were probably some of the more amazing weeks of this scholastic year(thanx to dag, adk, anb, and a tiny clutch of other ppl who go nameless but hold equal importance). Unfortunately this time had to come to an end. For the past few days, my few little slices of heaven have slowly been spoiling and showing the deeper inner diseased evils of their true beings. Then again, being that this has been a reoccurring aspect of my existence perpetuated by my own ignorance, i suppose i should consider myself a blessed individual that it had not have come sooner. Nonetheless, i'm stuck with the consequences of some of my most recent decisions and inadvertently driven myself into the ever-vigilant toils of the life that belongs to your beloved charlietrips. Some of the new ppl in my life accidentally misled me into interpreting their presence in an inaccurate fashion. As a residual result of this, i've acted upon false representation and committed some grave errors that i fear will not be so easy to overcome. If luck still has some unfinished business, hopefully his dealings will involve my mental and emotional welfare and i'll see the jovial light of disillusionment once again and have reality veiled by the ever so immaculate beauties of those true beings who've set my soul at a finely tuned, temporary median of peace."

"event","Now Now NOW!!! after days of silence, i think it's just about time that i update my journal for all of my loyal, nameless viewers. There's a truck load of events and instances that i could put in here, but today is the only day i'm willing to actually disertate to the world. Well it began simply enough: i was to wake up, get ready and be at my friend's church by 12 o'clock and upon my arrival, let the festivities commense. Instead, I'm woken by my mom and in my pseudodrunken, sleep deprived state i ask her what time it was, and she gives me 9:30. I then begin breaking land speed records in running up stairs, tripping over a homemade club, falling face-first into a shower, then rushing back downstairs half-naked in order to get ready. Luckily, not only do i make it there on time, but to add insult to injury, turns out my friend's been there the whole time. Anywho, we loiter and wut not and finally myself, friend, her sister and her sister's boyfriend make our way to the beach. Being a good sport and not wanting to be a prissy bitch, i go into the water and do the whole beachtime fun bit. I havent legitimately taken the full embrace of a beach front for about 8 years. It was, for lack of more sufficient phrasing, FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC!!...My friend and i wade through the waters and get beaten to death by waves i got to tacitly admire her feminine abilities to remain ladylike while having her boobs tossed to and fro by the mighty, sub-perverted currents. After that, we set up and head over to get rent some flix to conclude the day on a great note: Eurotrip and Club Dread although we never made it to C.D.. Admittedly so, it was my 1st time seeing it and i enjoyed it greatly along with the great company of the group and the junkfood and pizza flying thru the room. As life must universally govern; however, all good things must come to an end. So they gave me the pleasently long, yet slightly too brief ride home where more secrets were uncovered in a single than the time homer simpson read off the year's worth of plot twists of that soap opera. Word of the wise: Sand in places can be both bugging, but shockingly humorous as well. Clean those creavaces hun ;-)...anywho. i must make my leave and get the metric ton of sand off of my person as i'm sure a certain contemporary of mine should be. THANX SOOOOOOO MUCH FOR THE FANTASTIC TIME SWeety!!! *Muah*x100000 btw, i'm still getting u back for what u did to my finger. it looks like i have a marble with a fingernail attached to it on the end of my finger. GRRRRR"

"event","Lately, things've been taking interesting turns to say the very least. Seems like ever since that party last sat/sun. life's been taking me into conclusive and creative paths. Mom told me that my aunt had died on a Wed. last week. Just a few min ago i was asked by my mom if i wanted to go with her to my aunt funeral. Time's been flying a mile a minute and it seems like i can't even get a finger latched in the car door handle. Been talking to that gal i met at that party. Turned out to be a hell of a lot more than i expected in a person, which is fantastic turn of change considering who i've been having to deal with lately. Anyway i've come to meet my last summer before i have to make some drastic changes and self-evaluations. Hopefully, i'll have the support of all those in my life now to help me along...Ms. LE and DAG, ty for everything and hopefully i'll get thank you for a lot more for years to come."

"event","Man-o-man whata day. well... the day had begun simply enough with me lounging about idly lolling across my bed in attempts to find slumber when my mother comes knocking asking about a lawn mower. So we make our ways to this little corner mower repair shop with a suspicious looking owner named ""Jim"" who said he'd call if things were what he predicted. He had the most substantial wad of crisp cash in his pocket. On the way back, my mother and i questioned his true means of such a payroll(pimping and slanging drugs were the 2 top picks). After that, we make our ways to quizno's and get a large mesquite chicken. amazing to say the least. anyway after we arrive back home, i go to my room to wait for my mom to leave and uopn her departure, i notice something outside across the street. I inevitbly make my way outside and am spotted by my best friend from so many years back and i remember that they're having a party for someone. I get all ready and resexified and i make my way over there enjoying the music and dozens of mexican people i don't know when my friend's boyfriend was talking shit or something or other. Long story short, things transpired and there was near fight. Half the guys talking shit were too pussy to keep it goin. Anyway, in the midst of all of this, i see my friend's friend, erica. very nice girl and i meet one of her friends also an extremely nice girl...rare to find a cute loud mouth. so after all hell broke loose and the ambulance was called due to a passed out parental figure, 4 of us end up outside talking and i'm just getting home now. tired as all fuck but good...neway *muah* ty lord for the very interesting night"

Luckily, i was able to find the light and through the midst of an extremely leisurely week, i was treated with the presence of my super fantastic friend...ty very very very much *hugs* It's friends like her that make life worth living and give new meaning to the phrase *wham! bam! what the fuck just happened?"" anywho, hopefully this persists on into the weekend and also into the summer. once again, TY dag for making today possible and not killing me or anyone else in the process..."

"event","this was probably one of the most appealing days i've had in a while. Earlier in the afternoon, i was overcome by the need to spend the remainder of my day in bed dozing off when i get the most unexpected call from a friend who inadvertainly reminded me of festivities taking place in long beach. SO as a result i end up going there to see 2 other folks in the process. After loitering, we end up leaving and i'm back home and while i'm here the door bell rings (and this is at 9:30 at night). Low and behold it's my old friend who i grew up with and lived next to for 13 years...Needless to say it was great seeing her since i hadnt' for like a year. She's so beautiful. We looked at old pix and thought about old times, then we ended up seeing her sister's kid (looks so much like her dad it's frightening). Anywho, it was really amazing to think about old times and random fruity instances. We exchanged info and hopefully we'll be good friends again."

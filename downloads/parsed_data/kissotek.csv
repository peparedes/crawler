Oh yeah so I now live in Columbus.I will not go into the whole move thing or HEAD WILL EXPLODE!Lets just say next time we are soooo getting movers!
We are coming up this weekend to get a few more things out of Josh's aunt's garage.I might be staying at my dad's in Elyria.Not sure if I want to though since it is Superbowl weekend.Yuck.I might ask Betsy then I would be in Lakewood.Oh well we will see.
I haven't ventured too far from home yet.Walked around the neighborhood.Its nice...I like it so far.:)

Josh keeps wanting me to post this....The weekend before we started moving I had my first driving lesson from him.It actually went quite well.Learning on stick is kinda tricky.But I only stalled two times.I even got it up to second gear..WOOHOO!But I think what he really wants me to post about is that I also got to do my first doughnut.Heh.It was on purpose!I actully had it totally under control.I can see why he loves to play in the snow with his car but I really didn't care for it.Must be a guy thing.Lol.He is upset that we haven't really had any snow here yet.:)
Well I need to go do the dishes.I am sure I will be posting more later.lol."

"event","I know I have bitched and moaned about Luna.Yes She was a total pain the ass sometimes.I even went as far as to look for another home for her.But I loved her with all my heart and only wanted what was best for her.Everyone who knew her knows what a stressed out kitty she can be.I knew the move would have been rough for her.Last week even though I knew how she was going to be, I decided we were definitely taking her with us.

Tuesday night at 11:15 I had to put my Luna kitty to sleep.:*(

We have no idea what happened.
I wont go into all the details or I will start crying again...well ok it's too late for that...
Friday she was her normal self.On Sat she started acting a little strange.All day Sunday she was hiding.Sunday night she went down hill.Was kinda just laying there leaning to one side.When she did walk it very very slowly.We did get to cuddle a bit and I am very happy for that.But even then I could tell she wasnt doing to good.We got her to drink a little water and a little food.We put her on a pillow and wrapped her up where she pretty much stayed all night.I Had to go to work Mon:/ but I rushed right home.She was even worse.Would not even respond to me.I called Josh and off we went to the Vets.
Her test results were basically normal....she was mostly dehydrated...but her Glucose was elevated.I thought to my self Great.....now we both have diabetes.But it was mostly due to her being stressed out.
They kept her there overnight to do more tests.It is a 24 hour place and they were watching her all the time
When we got there Tueday night she was even worse.Being very unresponsive.She had suddenly became blind.She was Not when we brought her in.No one knew what was going on.They were trying their best.
I had brought a Arby's roast beef to see if she would eat.She LOVED Arby's.
Absolutely No response at all.We stayed with her for almost 3 hours.I would like to say that she knew I was there.But to be honest I am really not sure :(.By the time we decided to do it she pretty much had become catatonic.
I really trust this Vet and when she thought it was for the best...I knew there really was no hope.
I know there are few things we could have done to prolong her life but it wouldnt have been much of one.I know she would have been very unhappy that way.Feeding tubes and what not.
I can't believe she is gone.I never had to do this before.I can honestly say it is one of the hardest things to do :(

So Everyone out there who has kitty, doggy, or someother pet...Please go give them a GREAT BIG hug and tell them you love them!!

"event","So we now have a really cute apartment in Upper Arlington.We were on the way to look at another place two weeks ago when I happen to see a sign for this one.We stopped and looked at it.Called dude about it.Went out last Sat to talk to him in person and within 20 min we were signing a lease and gave us the keys.He turned down someone while we were there (before we signed the lease)who wanted to move in Sun.He would have made more money from them but I guess he really liked us lol.We wont start moving in for another 2 weeks or so.Josh is in Dallas right now for a mandatory Aloha bootcamp for work.He wont be back till the 16th.

God I hate moving.Mostly the packing.I like to procrastinate which is really bad!But hopefully I will get alot done in the next week.I will try at least. :)

Thanksgiving went well.Had a good time with family.My sister decided to spend it with her boyfriends family instead of coming up here.I can totally understand.There she would have been busy cooking and what not all day.Here her and I both would dwell on everything and start crying.Over all I think we both did ok.Only had one time when I almost lost it.She called me almost in tears and I had to calm her down.Thanksgiving was our moms birthday.Last year a day after Thanksgiving was the last time we were all together before she went into the hospital for good.So yeah needless to say it was alittle rough.But we made it through.:)


Blah...ok I have to finish getting ready for work.Hope everyone has a good day!Well try to then!"

"event","So yeah... I am finally going to update this thing.(If the damn thing doesn't get lost in LJ lala land Again!)Yes I have been in hiding again.Not really sure why just feeling anti-social I guess.Well the fact that I have felt like total crap lately hasn't help much either.Damn doctors and their stupid new medication.""hey i know ..she is feeling sick so lets give her something that will make her feel even worst!""Long story.bleh...I guess I can say I am getting better.It just sucks that because of the new medication my body is all out whack again.Gaining back the weight that I lost...yadda yadda...I could go on but I wont bore you with the details. 


Last time I really updated my sister and I were about to go to Niagara Falls.We did and had an Awesome time.Spent alot of money but it was well worth it! And Josh did make it home and we are the proud parents of a cute 1979 honda civic.Its so damn cute you can almost put it in your pocket Since then...well haven't done too much.Mostly hung out with family.My sister came up alot until she wrecked her car. :*(.Luckily her and her boyfriend walked away with only some scratches and bruises.But the car was totaled.
I did go out a few times....yeah I know they are few and far between.lol.Saw tons of movies.Did other stuff but nothing too exciting.


Well the biggest news that has happen in the last few weeks is that We are moving to Columbus!Josh got a awesome job down there.Right now he is training up here.We will be moving in the end of december.Craziness I know!...GREAT time to move.I have to work half a day on the 30th.I think that is going to be my last day.Josh will already have been there for a few weeks.
So if any of you are interested in(or know someone who needs) an awesome job at a coffee shop/cart (Java Jive) at University Hospital please let me know!I know it is coffee gig....but it really is a great job.Decent hours but not quite 40.No weekends.Pays quite well!Great tips(if you know how to work it lol).Awesome boss(Doug Bell)and coworkers.If you take RTA Doug will basically pay for your monthly pass. (after a few months)Get to listen to XM radio.Free coffee:) I am really going to miss this job!!! 


Honestly I am kinda scared about moving.This is the first time where I am picking up and moving when I have so much to lose.We moved around Way to much when I was a kid and I hated every minute of it!Yeah I did just pick up and move to Chicago in '97...but this time its different.Then I had basically nothing holding me back.I had just lost my job at record exchange and was in between apartments.And I was also 20.When I moved back to Lakewood I barely had enough stuff to fill one bedroom.Heh now I have more junk to know what to with!Ah well.I am willing to give Columbus a chance:)And there is that whole thing about loving Josh and wanting to be with him and stuff..Haha I am so romantic.I know things will be ok once we are settled but until then I more than likely will be a nervous wreck! lol 

I know for awhile we will be coming up to cleveland/lakewood at least once a month.His family is here too.So I will still be around.You might see me more then than you do now lol. 
okay enough rambling....i'm going to bed"

But anyways other than that things are going ok for the most part.
I haven't gone out to much.I hate to say it but I feel like going into total hiding again.:/I am trying not to trust me.
My sister came up the weekend of the 15th.We decide not to go to Pigface.Had some quality time with her.Went to to zoo.Good times.
Saw Elvis Costello on the 20th.Awesome show.
Hung out with Sean last weekend.Had alot of fun.Need to do that again soon!You know you can call me too Sean ;).
This weekend saw Hitchhiker's Guide.It could have followed the book more but over all it was a pretty good movie.It made me giggle.(alot like the book but just not as much)I like to giggle.Total set up for The Restaurant at the end of the Universe.Hope they do it!!
I can not wait to start working out again!I know that is alot of my problem with me feeling sad.As soon as I finish paying off my Mom's funeral I am so buying an Elliptical!
There are alot of ""fun"" issues concerning my Mom and things.God I miss her!I will tell you all of the fun in a later post.
Thanks again for all the wonderful words everybody!"

The hardest thing was telling my sister.
We are leaving soon to go to Wooster.My Mom left me the Next of Kin.I have no idea what I am doing and what I am going to do.Thank gods I have Josh.
Thank you to those who listened to me babble and was there to give me hugs!It ment alot!
I really do not want to deal with family who was not there to help my mom last year when she needed it the most.I do not want to hear how sorry they are.I know they are not.They did nothing for her.Not even a call to see how she was doing.Her own damn father, brothers and sisters.Gah I can go on and on about them but I am already worn out and I still have alot to do.
I know my sister and I will get through this.Just have to take it one step at a time.
I am not sure when I am coming home so I dont know when I will be able get back online.

"event","<P>Yeah..Hello Everyone.I have come out of hiding yet again. These last few months have been ..well you can say interesting..and alittle stressful as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Last month in honor of its own month...I found out that I now have Diabetes.(gee thanks Mom)Mind you I was completely fine about 5 months ago.But it does explain all my health issues I have had in the past few months.I guess this means I can stop worrying about donating my kidney to my mommy:(.So now I am trying to get used to all kinds of new medications..some which make me feel worse than I did before.We are hoping that I will only have to take pills and not do injections.Bah that would suck.But things seem to be working ok for now. </P>
<P>Speaking of my mom...in September she had to go in the hospital for an infected toe on her right foot.For those who don't know...she lost her left leg below the knee two years ago due to an infected toe.By the end of September she lost her left leg above her knee.The worse thing is..I know it could have been prevented by both her and her damn doctors.She never did take care of herself.Not eating right and such.(note to self...how NOT to take care of myself now that I am diabetic too) So with worrying about her And my sister(don't even want to go on that topic grrrrr)and with all my crap I will admit I had a few nervous breakdowns(hence the hiding again)But luckily I had someone to see me through it all.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Uhmmmm more stuff happened..but don't want to lay it all out at once lol.Halloween was fun.Went to an old friends wedding night before and went to Ceder Point on Halloween.Thanksgiving was good.Saw alot of family,including my mom and sister.Had 5 days off.Busy though.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Work is still great.Got a raise and boss is now paying my monthly bus pass.Still get to listen to fun music.Yeah...good times. </P>
<P>We are still thinking on going to Japan next year.Its still up in the air now that I have a few more medical bills.So we will see. 

Well I have to go finish getting ready to go over missdami's house for Halo Party.Whats this?!?!Yes I am actually leaving my house to do stuff with friends...ooooo. </P>"

"event","I guess I am back again.Yes I went back into hiding yet again.Although for a week or so it wasn't my fault...bad computer...bad!Well it had a case of bad memory.But it is feeling much better now.
The 4th weekend went well.I still can't believe its been a year with Josh already.Saturday we stayed The Glidden House.We stayed in the Winifred Kavanaugh suite.It was quite beautiful.For lunch went to Mama Santa's...mmmmmmmm..And for dinner we went to Sergio's.Awesome place.I highly recommend going there when you have some extra money.Its not too bad...about $75 for two.(Drinks,appetizer,main meal,dessert) but it was worth it :).Over all had a really good time...although there were a few issues... :/Rest of the weekend was uneventful.Watched a marathon of West Wing on the computer....yeah just about it lol.
Other than that haven't done too much.Just working.And going to the doctors :/.
That little lump under my arm(which they still don't know what it is).....well it decide to get worst.Some how it got infected or something.It almost was like a boil ..I dunno(I still blame the depo shot).It got twice, almost three times the size and hurt like hell.I can go into detail but I'd rather not.
I have been on antibiotics for a little while now.
Well today I guess I twisted my arm or stretched it alittle too much.cuz well...it kinda uhmmmm...this is so gross....it kinda erupted.For over an hour.Ewwwwww and Ow!Again I can go into detail if you really want.......blech.So now I am going to the doctors Again tomorrow.Hopefully we will figure this thing out and totally take care of it :/.At least it doesn't hurt as much now and I can lift my arm over my head without being in agony.lol.
So yeah thats about it. :)"

"event","Keep forgetting...my mom and sister finally moved back to Wooster.Hopefully things will go better for her there than when she was living with her brother..grrr.So far they are doing ok besides my sisters old friends are being rude...but hey you will get that.
This means she is Way closer and easier to get to!No more busing to Columbus and having Joanna drive the other two hours or so....like before in April for my sisters birthday.But hopefully she had fun with my family.lol.And got free food lol.=)
I am still thinking about the whole donating my kidney to my mommy thing.She still doesn't really want me to but is willing.I do....I just don't know how long I would be able to take off from work now.Damn daycare people for screwing that up.When I worked at the daycare ,they were going to to pay up to 3 months of family/medical time leave.Java Jive doesnt really offer that lol.I think I would only be able to take a month off...without pay.I am pretty sure I would need a little more time off for that.I don't know......GRRRRRR!
Ok shower time!"

"event","Bah I can't wait till the two months are up so I can get my insurance through work!
I Really hate Metro!I was there on Tue. untill 1am with No sign of getting in anytime soon.So we went home.I went in right after work on Wed. They sent me to Urgent Care.I was there a total of 3 hours...being seen...and getting rated...and then waiting for Josh to pick me up(grrrrr)All in all much better.
Long story short I have a strange little lump.Nothing really to be concerned about(not anymore anyway lol)I need to go back next week sometime to get it looked at again.This time not thru ER thankfully.I guess its mostly ""a watch it and make sure it doesn't get bigger"" thing.
On another note...girls.....never take the Depo-vera shot.The side effect sucks!It seems I got most of them.I guess the worst are suppose to taper off after 6 months.So we will see...if not I am shaving my head and starving myself lol.
Haven't really done to much lately...Work.Watch the kids on Tuesday and Thursday after work.Its extra money.
Last night ended up hanging out with Joanna and her mom.It was kind of last min.I wasnt going to do anything since I had a bad headache all day.But its her mom's fault...she told Joanna to call me since it was about time for dinner lol.So we had yummy Indian food.Then we decide also last min to go see a movie.Her mom Really wanted to see The Terminal.So she payed for all of us to make up for it lol.It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
Okay I should be cleaning so I am off."

Got mad tips too.
After work I went over to Josh's Grandfather's house for a family reunion type thing.His grandfather and his brother haven't talked in over 30/40 years.Josh found him...blah blah blah....it went well.

"event","I wrote out a post last night and LJ ate it...blah so I went to bed and read lol.

Had a decent weekend.
On Friday I went out again with Joanna and her mom.We had dinner at the Winking Lizard.They have one of the best hard ciders Ever!MMMMM I want more!:)Then we hung out at Borders for a bit where I spent too much money.I finally bought the Massive Attack dvd.I also bought the new King book and a book about Elvis Costello for Josh.
After that we went to see Harry Potter.I really liked it although they did leave out alot of information that would have explained alot of things to people who don't read the books.But I guess for some reason they did that on purpose.Who knows.Over all....go see it if you havn't yet.

Sat went to the post office, got a haircut and then went to like 20 stores.Okay maybe not quite that many...but it sure felt like it when I finally got home.I made a yummy dinner.We were suppose to go out to the HiFi to see Josh's friend play.But like always he changed his mind about going so we didn't.Its all good I guess.

Sun was a lazy day.Did laundry and some dishes and got hooked on Zoo Tycoon again.Damn Crack.Bah.We were suppose to go out for dinner and a movie...but Josh had to go fix his aunts computer.....so I didn't think we would go out at all(like always lol)But he surprised me and we went out for a late meal.Well and a light show too.Just as we were leaving the wonderful lightning storm started.It was beautiful...alittle scary but beautiful.
So that is that.
I still really like my job.Got to hear Pigface and Joy Division and many more fun tunes there.But then the boss came in and we had to listen to the ball game lol.But it was a good game to listen to...14 to 0.heh are these really the Indians??But then we got to change it back after to the game :)
Okay got to finish getting ready for work."

Had a great time last night with Joanna and her mom.We went to Sullivan's for dinner.Mmmmm I think I have a new addiction.Ate way to much...but it was damn good.:)Joanna's mom is awesome!I can't understand how anyone could think otherwise.Unless they have issues :D

Last weekend was fun.Saturday night went to a party at Josh's best friends Tim's.I had fun...got Really drunk.Good times with good people.
Sunday went out with Joanna.Shared some really yummy Indian food and then went to see Day after tomorrow.Good movie.Glad I saw it in the theater.Some things we just didn't get...but hey it's just a movie lol.Then we went back to my house...had a few drinks..looked through a few of our yearbooks.Made fun of people and ourselves of course.Its amazing considering that we hated most of the same people that we were'nt friends in highschool.lol.If we were....I do believe we would have gotten in all kinds of trouble ;).
Monday was a lazy day.

My job goes really well.I am still not quite used to the fact that its constantly busy.Gotta drink more coffee it seems.Good thing its free lol.But it is so much fun.I love saying that about a job.Great tips.Good people.Awesome pay.Good times.Plus I get to flirt with all the cute doctors and nurses. ;)I am also getting extra hours already.Soon I will be able to pay off my credit card debt.Yay.It is good to have money again.
Well I am gonna go finish watching The Last Crusade and maybe have some of Josh's yummy chili."

"event","Okay I think I am ready to act alive again.I apologize for being in hiding for so long.Just haven't been feeling like my self lately.I guess I mostly blame the damn Depo.Bah I dunno.I am trying get better lol.

Someday maybe I will post all the interesting details about the trip to Europe.Lets just say that just about Nothing went the way it was planned.I will say it was mostly Josh's fault lol.But all in all I did have a good time.Spent too much money...but hey.Only went to England,France,and Italy.Note don't go to Paris on a Tuesday if you really really want to see the Louvre.The only day we were there....and the damn thing is closed heh.Yes that is pretty much how the whole trip went lol.I am sorry Julie and Feima ...didn't get to Germany.So no yummy German guy.I do have one pic specially for you lol.

Lets see I am done being a nanny for Betsy.They are now in California to finish the movie.I really miss them.I think they were going to try to get Drew to fly me out there sometime....but now it would only be for a weekend.My ass finally got a job.Yay.Heh I didn't really have to look for it.My neighbor works there and she had him call me.Its another coffee shop thing (a cart at a hospital)and the best part is.. I am making more starting out than I did as a manager at Arabica.Which by the way I will probably never set foot in again.Rochelle is such a sad sad person.But yeah. Alot of room to grow at this place.So again Yay! 

Here is the probably the biggest change for me ....Julie....Sean...(and quite a few others lol)you will be happy to hear this.A certain person is No longer in my life.I have no idea why I kept him in my life for so long...besides to use him for the cell phone...heh.Maybe I felt sorry for him.I really don't know.I got tired of being treated like shit and then apologizing to him for it(theres so more but no need to get into it lol).Julie keep the spaghetti cans handy...lol.Up until a week ago I thought about trying to salvage the friendship untill I realized there never really was one.He is such a big person that he deleted my email address so I don't have the deltamind one anymore(which he did without telling me ooooo)He is also turning off my the cellphone.(Unless I call him and grovel heh) Which I wanted him to in the first place.I knew he never would be human about switching it over so I just got a new one last Sun.I don't even have the old one on me anymore.It will be dropped of at his house..it was a piece of shit anyway...didnt get my messages half of the time.

So yeah.....away with the bad (or should I say dead weight haha)on with new (hopefully) better things!"

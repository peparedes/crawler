"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"" align=""left""><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""5"">Merry Christmas everyone!<br /></font><br />Last night was one of the best nights I've ever had since the Christmas break. Wow. It was like a Gelanco reunion here last night (well except for my other uncle. he's in the province). All of my cousins in mom's side were here and it's just so fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />AND..&nbsp;<font size=""4"">BIGBIG</font>&nbsp;thanks to all those people who greeted me and my family yesterday and today!<br /><br />So I've got hangovers from last night and my head still hurts from all those screaming the kids made in the middle of the night. Seriously, I think their mouths should be taped once in a while. gawwwwd.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyways, one of my&nbsp;cousins, Angelene is so ADORABLE. I love her to bits.<br />So I just woke up and she was screaming her lungs out coz she couldnt find her mommy anywhere so&nbsp;i got up the bed and went to their room. I tried to comfort her and one of my aunts went to the room and opened her wallet and got some bucks. Angelene stopped crying and said, ""tita, penge aku&nbsp;pewa(pera)?"" in her cutest voice. haha. She's just so cute.<br /><br />Right now I just wanted to relax, sleep and stop eating. Promise, this is what&nbsp;I hate about Christmas, it always gets me fat. awww. Tomorrow will be another hectic day for me. gawd. haha.<br /><br />anyways, have a great week ahead!<br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>I'm sorry it took me a long time to update. My keyboard got fucked up so I had to buy a new one and the telephone line was down. waaaa. </p><p>Ok so today was a miracle coz i woke up really early. 7am is early, right? Well, in my life it's already an achievement. Waking up early in a weekend or a weekday(w/o school of course) morning is very rare for a girl like me. So I woke up, walked a little bit in the playground, went inside the house, checked my phone (to see if there were any messages, unfortunately, none.), walked again around the playground. Okay so basically i was just checking some guy out that's why i was walking around the playground again and again. Any problem with that? haha. Is it my problem that he's cute? it's his. = )</p><p>so... Two days w/out classes. This rocks. But I hope the storm wouldn't push through tomorrow here in our place, coz that would surely suck and It's dads bday celebration and I suuuuper miss my cousins. Though his bday's really yesterday and we celebrated it last night in HulaHula at westgate but i would still insist on the celebration tomorrow. whatever happens. grrrr. haha.</p><p>Anyways, everybody here in our neighborhood feels the christmas spirit already, even the people here in our house. except me. haha. Well, I just don't wanna get that feeling yet. Because, One, I still have no money for gifts. Two, I have no idea on what gift I should give to my friends and my cousins. And Three, Christmas means it's the end and endings makes me sad.</p><p>okaay. so have a lovely day ahead people!</p>"

"event","This is the 3rd time that&nbsp;i made a new lj. i just can't seem to be contented with the second one and the 1st one seems so boring.&nbsp; 

Anyways, I'll try to keep this one clean. I'll TRY. 

So much for my introduction.&nbsp; 

Btw,&nbsp;I'd like to congratulate my friend for winning the doubles game in&nbsp;table tennis earlier. Love you yie. You did great. = ) And thanks for dropping me home. I love you more for that. &nbsp;= ) 

On my way home, in a trike, with charie,&nbsp;I realized a lot of things. That I'm blessed with a lot of good friends. A LOT. And&nbsp;I admit that&nbsp;at some point in my life I thought I made the most foolish decision that I could ever make. Letting a friend drive&nbsp;me away. AND&nbsp;let her&nbsp;think I have ""LOW CLASS"" friends. Because you know what?! I have the ""HIGHEST CLASS OF FRIENDS""&nbsp;a person like me could ever have&nbsp;and I know that we've got&nbsp;eachothers back whenever we need. so, wbu? 

enough off my rantings. as i said, i'll try to keep this one clean. 
ciao! 
te amo."

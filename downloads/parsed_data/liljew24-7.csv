"event","ok so i am listening to this song and i'm not sure what its title is or who its by but it talks about love and it being more then words. I started to contemplate the meanings in this song and then it dawned on me that this song is what i want from Justin this boy that i am seeing. I dont want him to say that he likes me i just need something from him that tells me he does. I want him to want to hold me and kiss me, you know just to be with me. I just want to know where this relationship is going, if its even going to be a relationship. Jesus life has to many unanswered questions in it.

I really want a cell phone! ever since i lost mine oh two and a half months ago i have been having to use my fathers! ughhh i want my own to my numbers in and call people from, i want to have my old number back already god damnit!

Rachel came with a problem to say
Her relationship was going down the drain
And it brought her much sorrow and pain
Alex tried to do all that she could
nothing could help, nothing would
Alex told her they couldnt be friends
And rachel said nohting to try and make mends
She said that alex made her mad
So her revenge was to make me sad
She cause so much drama
said we talked about her mama
Shes only full of shit and lies
Thats why shes who we despize
Now the school wants to play helper

"event","SO today didnt go so well. Rachel Burger decided to cause more drama. Then i hated Alex then i said things i shouldnt of and a whole lot of shit went down. BUT because alex is such a goodf friend she conronted me and now everything is all right, and instead of alex doing wrong and or me doing wrong RACHEL did the big wrong. Alex and I decided that Rachel is this cook ok and she was making this meatball soup  that used to have so many meatballs but when she decided to stirr the soup all the meatballs left because stirring them made them but heads and cause lots of drama. Well now its just alex in this big pot and if she doesnt get out then she is going to drown from all the stirring. Rachels about to lose all she has and she doesnt even realize it."

"event","hi everyone! i love everyone! OMG can i just say that this weekend was orgasmic! orgasmic! I made friends from all over the United States. From the time i set foot in the Hilton to the time i left, i was surrounded by the most amazing jews i will ever meet in my entire life. I was given so many random names this weekend....let's see i was Skirt girl- because i didnt realized that i had signed up for Yoga and had to attend it in a skirt. I made tons of friends in there though.There was Rebecca who even though is a little HO, i love her to death. Then there was a large group of boys, Yoni, Josh, and Nate. The greatest boys in the entire world, absolutely hilarious! Yoni did Yoga in tight sweat pants and and pink see through tank top, it was HOTT OH AND I MEAN HOTT! i dont think that anyone can do the oh mighty worrior like YONI can. If there was a boy that could dance better then me, which might i add is a hard thing to come by it would be him. He can give a lap dance like a black women gone wild!! oy vey. And he's the nicest person ever, he loves to be friends with everyone and loves to have a good time. Ok so then i was called Banana girl- wow this one was a dusy. I was on the bus headed to  Japaneese American museum and i have no idea why the hell i was there! i sware i thought that it was an Art Museum, i wasnt the only one, everyone that was there with me thought it was too. Instead we had to listen to an old japaneese guy talk about the war, he was so stubborn. He got onto my friends when they were talking and said that he didnt do this for the pay! and if we didnt want to listen then we shouldnt be there.I didnt want to listen and i didnt want to be there! AGHH. Well yea besides if he didnt do it for pay then what the hell was he doing there, he told us himself he didnt have a high school degree! I hate him! anyways on the bus ride we were eating lunch and someone pulled out a banana. Then we got to talking about how i dnt have gag reflexes as bad as others, so i deep throated it, it was hilarious. My friend max and dylan video taped it and was going to put on there tv show in Texas. i'm going to be a star!!!! yes! lol well anyways. I made friends cause i can deep throat a banana, oh well i'll take them any way i can lol. So we got to go to Universal studios in the rain, besides the fact that i was cold and wet i had a blast. We got free food, like you have no idea how much and how good it all was. Have you ever noticed that the size of your stomach grows about ten times larger when the word free food comes into play. I ate so much it was ridiculous, i mean food just tastes a lot better when its FREE!! We had a big orgie, well i mean it was called a dance but that was like a cover up so that it didnt sound so obvious. I mean picture it, a large group of teens hooking up and extremely wet.......from the rain ugh( sickos)well sounds like a large jewish orgi to me! I saw to guys make out which was amazing, and broke it Down with my home girl LILA AND REBECCA. i love them. i want to give a shout out to Rebecca, Lila, Josh, Yoni, Aaron, Daniel,Jakim, steven, Justin, David, Nate, Brandon, Aaron, Zach, Matt, and Ed..oh Ed he was different.lol well g2g i love you all tata. I have to write a paper Akshav..i thinks thats how you spell it. It means now in hebrew I love Yoni lol"

About a month ago i was dating this guy named Brice from Abercrombie and Fitch and well one night he wanted to have sex with me and i said not gonna happen. Well after that night he stopped calling me! WTF! i hate him so much. well anyways lately i have been seeing him a lot and he always says hi to me~ so naturally i am obligated to say hi back. Well tonight after i saw him  i called his cell phone and left a message saying ""hi brice umm after tonight i realized i dont want you talking to me anymore, so if we happened to see eachother dont say hi to me because then i feel obligated to say hi back and i dont want to talk to you because i dont like the person you are so dont say hi to me i dont want to feel like a bitch if i dont respond or stupid if i do!does that make me a bitch? i hope not. i talked to alex m tonight and she said that she had the same experience with john messamore! i hate that boy he is such a fucking duesch.Ughh last night i started crying because ryan and me were talking about how much we  loved eachother, jeremy posted a song on hi LJ that was really true about me and him, and Kyle said he wanted to go to Prom with me. Why do boys cause me so much stress? i dont get it i swear though they are taking a toll on me because i have got grey hair no joke! Erica pulled threee out of my head the other day in class. Oh and today i said to sit by myself for lunch, it was just me and my apple juice. and well....then i sat with Erica and her friends, it was wierd i felt wierd and out of place. She has really changed a lot since we stopped hanging out, for like the worst too. So i g2g i have to pack for Jacksonville tomorrow, off for another youth group adventure. Kyle and i promised eachother that we werent going to be making out or hooking up with anyone but eachother. i know i can do it but this weekend will be a test. well love love have to go pack"

Wel they finally picked me up and we were off to the mountains. It was beautiful up there, i got to go snowboarding and the next morning my ass hurt like a bitch. But me and annette were the cutest snow bunnies out there. On the 25 christmas! yaya! we relaxed because my whole body ached from head to toe.That night we went tubing in the snow and it was the mostess fun  i have ever had in my life!! Al though, you know that tingling feeling you get when your foot falls asleep and it makes you really uncomfortable, well that was what my whole entire body felt like the entire trip accept for the fact that i couldnt feel my feet or hands it was preety much like that the whole time. well the next day i went skiing that would be today and i went on the blck diamond slope~ thats the advanced slope for those of you who have no idea....(Jeremy i know u know what i am talking about)! well yea then we came back home it was about 2 hours away. Annettes house is really big and beautiful. Well g2g tomorrow we are going to the pentagon...annettes parents work in there and so i get to inside where no else gets to go...i'll take PICTURES!!!

"event","you know what i hate...besides a few people. I hate boys, not all of them but the ones that only talk to you to talk to you so they have you say good things about them to a specific friend of yours. Lets take Trey for example: when he found out that i knew Edith every time he talked to me he would make some comment about her but he would always end it  with, oh i dont like her though! Shut the Fuck up and just admit it! i hate it when guys are indenial or they think that you are stupid enough to believe that they dont. AHHH! i'm sorry i just needed to vent. thankyou.! oh you know what else? i hate that boys have this power over some girls. See a girl doesnt think that she is pretty unless a boy likes her and wants to go out with her. And i have noticed that a lot of girls like just cant be complete without a guy in their life, i mean like they have to have that boyfriend role in their life and if they dont, well then they get desperate. Take Nia for example, the other day she said to me "" face it lauren i'm just not pretty enough for boys!"" or something along those lines. i think that is awful that guys have that power over someones CONFIDENCE. it sucks! Nia i think that you are a beautiful person inside and out! dont forget it. well anyways i will write something nicer later.. love love! bye"

I asked him to also love life b/c right now i am very depressed.. my mother hates me and i am never good enough for her and everything i do can be better by some piece of advice that she offers me. I think that she is embabarassed of me and the fact that i dont have some amazing SAT score for her to brag about to her family and friends. Oh and last night i told her that i hated her and my father for making me live here in Niceville, and having to go to OWC to get my AA before i could go off somewhere! AHHHHH!!! If you know me then you would know that i hate it here and would do anything to get out! Running away has seriously been a big consideration.

I was a little disapointed when alex monda nad i didnt break in our amazing duo and i was devistated when she did not break in DI, But i couldn't help but be exstatic when i broke all the way to Semi Finals in HI, that's top 12. I would just like to thank those of you who believed in me and watched me in my rounds...thankyou! Alex baby i love you thanks for sticking by me during the whole thing, nad Nia too. Also Nia thankyou for comforting me during the whole Ryan thing. iT was really sweet of you. Oh quote un Quote from HOSOMER ""where did you and Alex M go, did you leave to make out, I was going to come and watch!"" ewww! lol i love him. Ryan made me feel so bad this weekend. i felt like he was embarassed of me and i know that his mother doesnt like me. Oh i bought a camo colored ball cap from the school store that says Florida Gators on it. When i got home my mom took me to KFC, when we were in there she told me take it off because it was boggy and you werent supposed to wear hats inside! wtf IT'S KFC people go NAKED for christs sake, atleast my head was covered. She jsut hated it b/c it was camo and she hates that it looks boggy because of it! i told her no and kept it on. Anyways . oh on the way home from the tournament it was me and cameron in a seat and nia laying across us. What was really funny is that our coach she likes to do routine bus checks to make sure no one is hooking up. So she walked over to where we were laying and pulled the blankets off NIA, poor thing she could barely open her eyes, nad it was freezing. she looked at rigby and was like i'm tired, so rigby goes you are and pulled them off her again.haha too funny!

After that we pickep Erica and went onto Fortwalton where i met Jeremys mom the women who hates me and Noah picked us uo there. The st of the night is confidential do to the fact that could potentially lose any privaledges that i have,do to my actions. But i will tell you this mcu, Jeremy fell two times and it was so fucking funny. once was off the side of a scooter and the other time he didnt fall all the way but it was over a parking bump, it was because i wasw trying to reach in his pocket, where he keeps his penis...or somehting like that. Lets see on sunday i didnt wake up ti'll 12:00 and then me adn Blain watched movies and just sat on the couch. Then he took my brother and i to B eef oh Bradys for dinner. it was really really sweet of him. Now he is gone and i am talking to my friends on the computer.

"event","hello all my loves. i must make this short and sweet, my neck hurts so bad it jsut doesnt seem capable right now to hold my head up much longer. Anyway today Alex expressed her feelings about michelle Robinettes brother to me and about 60 other people. i found it very entertaining. Oh nad like i guess Michelle is this super smart person like smarter then i thought that she was, and is going to give me and alex a word everyday. These are words my dictionary doesnt even know. My hamster (java da hamstue) stewey for short is so wierd. He is like a little killer. he will attack you through the cage, and he tries to claw and hiss at yo. he also sleeps on his back, and i know he's not dead because when i go to poke him he tries to eat me. He's fricking crazy i tell you he even ate his hbrother. My head is pounding. it's not a head acke but it sure is pounding. ok well i must be leaving i still have homework and hopefully Alex Monda is going to come over today like she said she would. Love Love! Muah"

"event","Hi there, this is my very first journal entry. Don't laugh if i am a little bit rusty this time, i will eventually get the hang of it. Well lets see... Today i was sick all through out school because i got back yesterday from a Jewish youth group trip. It was great! Jewish people really know how to break it down. If there was a list of like the top 5 most fun religions ever, Judaism would definetly be number one. We can dance like no other and we really dont give a sh*t what anyone else thinks about us. We promote kissing also. There is this thing called nfty points. When you hook up with someone at the convention(kissing) then you get the points that they are worth. It all depens on the ranking that you are in your youth group. Like i am worth 3 points which is a lot b/c i am the president. I guess it's just something funny to talk about. It's not really a big deal to us to do this, we are all so close. I think that is one of the reasons why i love being Jewish so much. We know what eachother is thinking or feeling kind of on an ESPN lol ESP level. I wish that there was more Jewish people where i live. Here the biggest population is a religion called (boggy) thats when they worship the mullet (fish and hair cut) oh and your the kewlest peroson ever if you can walk under your truck! I know this is todally random but I think that my new love is Phil Collins. I am listening to his love songs cd that my daddy bought for me and it really is good. It even has the song from Tarzan on it. That song is so cute. Well anyways i am so excited about this weekend, if i can get over this humungous head cold. This boy that i am talking to his name is Blaine. He is 19 with blone hair and blue eyes. He just, i dunno lights up my day. He calls me at the most random times just to see how my day is going and to tell me that he miss's me! oye vey! i just got off the phone with my friend Kayla, we have been friends since we were 4. Anyways her and her bf are attached at the hip and it's so cute. Although if something happens in the relationship they're definetly stuck. They work together now, same days, same hours.lol i told he she was crazy but they are crazy in love and i am happy for her. Her relationship with him is one that i hope to one day have. They share this bond where not only are the bf and gf but they are best friends and can tell eachother anything and everything. I just think that their bond is one to admire. I have trouble with things like that. Like one of my really good friends, Jeremy who at the moment we are not speaking. i hope that it's not forever. I think that it is b/c i ha ve done some pretty stupid things to him in the past and always expected him to understand because he loved me so much. Maybe i took advantage of him a little bit. I think that it is because i had never had anyone care fomr me the way he did. I hurt him by not caring the same way. Now we dont even speak and he has erased my number from his phone. That really hurt, it was like saying you are dead to me i guess in a wierd sort of way. wow i am glad that i signed up on live journal so that i could kvetch(yiddish for complain)to all of you. A word of advice that i know all of you have gotten one way or another. But dont tarnish lifes treasures b/c sometimes you cant restore them back to new."

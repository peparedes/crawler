<P>You need a bike that can handle your addiction to the twisties as well as comfortably carry two on a weekend trip through the mountains. Your bike is the FJR1300. Can I borrow it someday? </P></TD></TR>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#006600>At that point I will have exactly 6 million and 2 things to do, and in a very short time frame.&nbsp; Once the check is deposited, I'll pay off our vehicles and the motorcycles, lower their insurance coverages and put the van on market.&nbsp; No minivans in Hawaii.&nbsp; I think it's a law.&nbsp; I have two bills that need paying off... one is reallllllly old debt and I just can't WAIT to have that one gone.&nbsp; It's embarassing how long that one has stretched on.&nbsp; Going to buy that new mattress I mentioned earlier... most mattress stores do deliver the new one and remove your old one for disposal.&nbsp; I even found a store that offers a military discount right on their ad in the phone book.&nbsp; Sweet!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#006600>C made the most surprising and exciting suggestion recently... it's momentous in my little world.&nbsp; He suggested I get my eyes lasered once we have the house money.&nbsp; I've always wished that could be me..... shedding my glasses, once and for all.&nbsp; I've worn them since the summer of 4th grade.&nbsp; I had the ugliest glasses while growing up.&nbsp; I used only contacts for about a 4 year period in college, but I didn't take good care of them, and now contacts really bother my eyes when I put them in.&nbsp; I only use contacts to play paintball, and I'm not even playing that anymore.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#006600>Getting LASIK would change a lot of things for me, and none of them negatively.&nbsp; I can't imagine what it'd be like to go swimming, especially surfing out in the waves of Hawaii, and be able to SEE!&nbsp; I would be able to see my kids while we were all playing out there!!!&nbsp; Or just swimming in a pool, and be able to see everyone.&nbsp; Being able to wear sunglasses again would be fabulous.&nbsp; Waking up in the night and being able to see the clock and anything else without fumbling for my glasses.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#006600>So I'm wondering if I'm a candidate for the surgery, and if so, how quickly could I get it done while still here in South Carolina?&nbsp; I know that if you wear contacts, you can't for the two weeks prior to the surgery.... but since I don't wear contacts, how quickly could I get it done?&nbsp; I won't have much time in between getting the house money and getting on a plane to Honolulu.&nbsp; I don't know for sure, but you'd think getting eyes lasered would be cheaper here in SC than in HI.&nbsp; I know the Army hospital does do the procedure, but I would still have to pay for it as I'm not the active duty service member, and that there's a horribly long waiting list for NON military personnel.&nbsp; So that tells me I should do it before I go.&nbsp; Just time is running out!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#006600>Anyway... I need to buy several suitcases.&nbsp; The ones I have are 25 years old and, while they are big, they don't hold as much as the more modern, soft luggage suitcases.&nbsp; They're pretty skinny.&nbsp; And blue!&nbsp; The kids and I will have to live for a month or more out of what we pack in these suitcases, so I have to be smart and thorough.&nbsp; I can also box up things and mail them to C right now.&nbsp; Last night I bought 3 shipping boxes and put all sorts of good stuff in them.&nbsp; So I think I'll keep shipping things like that, reducing the number of suitcases I have to worry about dragging around an airport.&nbsp; We are each allowed 2 pieces of checked luggage, so my first plan was to buy 6 suitcases!&nbsp; But... my son wouldn't be able to lug around 2 full sized suitcases, even on wheels... he'll have enough to do to not get lost and haul around his carryon bag.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#006600>Guess I'd better get off the computer.&nbsp; I have so much to do.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>Alright, now we're getting somewhere!!&nbsp; Finally I'm feeling progress here, and it's helping me feel a little better.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>We'll close on the house the end of the first week of August.&nbsp; At least that's the current plan.&nbsp; The appraiser is coming over on Tuesday.&nbsp; So if this is correct, I have <U>TWO WEEKS LEFT OF WORK!!!!!!!!!!</U>&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>My house is SO clean, yet in such a shambles!&nbsp; All the rooms are painted now, everything's out that isn't going to Hawaii (except for the piano still, but that's leaving next week) and the dump runs with all the trash are fewer and farther between.&nbsp; But all the closets are emptied out into the nearest room... and what a mess!!!&nbsp; Painting closets is not a fun job.&nbsp; Neither is painting windows.&nbsp; But the friends who bought the trampoline came and picked it up, leaving a large weed-infested circle in the back yard that really needs mowing and some serious sod and seed.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>So I'm going to buy C and I a new mattress for our bed.&nbsp; We deserve it!!&nbsp; This thing we have we are at least the 3rd owners of.&nbsp; He's been gone 7 months, comes home for his 10 day leave, and on the first morning wakes up to a terrible back ache.&nbsp; He's like, ""It's the mattress!!!!!&nbsp; All that time... I had no back problems!""&nbsp; When you buy a new mattress, I assume the mattress store delivers the new one to your house?&nbsp; After all, how many people can really transport a king size mattress?&nbsp; But the question I have is...... will they take my old one away with them?!&nbsp; Because if I can't transport the new one home, I certainly can't transport the old one to the dump!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>We're also going to buy a new dresser for the bedroom, a new lawn mower (a self-propelled one that drives itself), a new car (hopefully a Jeep Wrangler) and a new couch once I arrive on the island.&nbsp; I have decided not to ship our minivan.&nbsp; Who the hell wants a MINIVAN in Hawaii??&nbsp; NOT me.&nbsp; As much as I wanted that thing 5 years ago, I don't want it now.&nbsp; It served it's purpose and I made full use of it for all the roadtrips we took, all the Girl Scout trips and all the gymnastics meets and carpooling.&nbsp; But that's all over with for the next three years.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>I can't think of anything else to focus on except HAWAII. Everything I have to do centers around the move there.&nbsp; Most of it involves preparing the house for sale.&nbsp; I really look forward to this work being over.&nbsp; I'm ready for my 3-year Hawaiian beach vacation.&nbsp; Bring It On!!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

I haven't really needed this journal for anything. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff><STRONG>PLUS... my Travel Journal about Hawaii is WAYYY more fun to write in.&nbsp; I like that site better, too.&nbsp; They host my pictures FOR me, which will be very helpful during my transition time... after I leave South Carolina, but before I get set up with internet service in Hawaii.&nbsp; My favorite part of my Travel Journal is that people can subscribe to it!&nbsp;&nbsp; So everytime I post an update/entry, they will get an note in their email alerting them to that fact.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff><STRONG>I can't tell you how many people have told me, ""You'd BETTER keep in touch!!&nbsp; We want PICTURES!!!""&nbsp; So I was accumulating an impressive pile of email addresses on little pieces of paper.&nbsp; All the while thinking... I can't imagine emailing 90 people, attaching 10 pictures every day!&nbsp; So I quickly thought of doing an online travel-type journal, and found just the thing!&nbsp; And it's free!!!&nbsp; And they host my pictures for me.&nbsp; I don't know how much space I'm allowed tho... so I hope it's ample.&nbsp; Otherwise I am willing to pay for one, in order to have loads of space for Hawaii pictures!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff><STRONG>So anyway, this new journal is travel specific... and it's geared towards people doing something like starting from home, doing a fabulous circuit around the world and then returning home.&nbsp; But I'll be using it a bit differently.&nbsp; And the best part?&nbsp; The subscription notices.&nbsp; Boy do I love that.&nbsp; =o)</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff><STRONG>So let's see here.&nbsp; Oh yeah.&nbsp; What is today?&nbsp; July 20 I think. Oh yeah, I see the date up there.&nbsp; The only thing keeping me from going to Hawaii now is waiting on the closing of the house.&nbsp; We decided I can't very well quit my job and move while we still have to pay on the van, the two bikes, etc.&nbsp; So I have to work until I have the check in hand from the sale of the house.&nbsp;</STRONG></FONT></P>"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#990000>OMG, my elbow is NOT happy from all of the painting yesterday.&nbsp; Repainting that front foyer and hallway took two coats of everything, and it took a long time!&nbsp; It's such a shocking difference out there from that dark rose to ice blue!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I like it tho, and the kids are amazed.&nbsp; And I did all the trim and doors in ""Country White"" instead of gleaming, shiny white, and that's a big difference too, tho you might not think it would be.&nbsp; As soon as I buy the fabric and make new curtains, I'll put up before/after pics.&nbsp; I still haven't scraped the windows either.&nbsp; I got all caught up in putting new music on the iPod to better entertain myself doing said scraping... and never went back down!&nbsp; LOL</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#990000>I told you about Sam maybe buying the truck.&nbsp; That would be so nice.&nbsp; And I get the added bonus of him making the dump run for me to empty it out!&nbsp; Wheeeeeeeeee</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#990000>I got 3 more Band of Brothers discs yesterday, so you'll have the full collection soon.&nbsp; I got American Beauty, too, but of COURSE it's scratched towards the end.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#990000>I am so glad you got a good camera today!!&nbsp; Awesome seeing pics of you and the stuff you're doing.&nbsp; Sounds like you got a good deal too!&nbsp; I am currently wondering what I should do about this whole Rambus memory issue.&nbsp; This computer is so slow, and I want to install the DVD burner soon and get rolling with that stuff so I know what I'm doing before we get to Hawaii.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#990000>Alright, well I got involved in MORE music acquisition, so I think it's all done now.&nbsp; We had a few bottle caps for free songs from iTunes, and that's good for E's pod, since it's more pop/mainstream stuff.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#009900>So today's project is writing the ad for the Post &amp; Courier and the MUSC and Santee Cooper papers for our extra shit.&nbsp; I think the piano is only going to be worth something like $1,000-2,000.&nbsp; And who knows if I'll even get that much here in the armpit of SC.&nbsp; I hope someone buys that weight bench too.</FONT></STRONG></P>

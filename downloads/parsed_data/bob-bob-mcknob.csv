"event","...when you're younger uncle is playing the irish jig music on a saxophone right in front of you. 

i have finally received a copy of the teachings of buddha...god bless kern county library. i intend to read it all by the end of the week.

i meditated again for the first time in more than a week, and i realized how much good it did me. 

but in the end, what else can i say but...

i miss her.

my ramen bowl awaits...

'cept for this:

SunHitsTheSky777: man. i'm gonna be a meathead thursday. I'm nervous
godhatesjack: my uncle's busting out on the saxophone
godhatesjack: he's playin the irish jig
godhatesjack: hey, don't sweat it
SunHitsTheSky777: why is your uncle playing an irish jig on a saxaphone?
godhatesjack: why not
godhatesjack: 1. he's younger than me
godhatesjack: 2. he's practicing for his band class
godhatesjack: 3. and he got tired of me making him play the mission impossible theme
godhatesjack: so what's the meathead wage?
SunHitsTheSky777: man, i hope you don't get offended by this, cos it's true,  but only mexican americans have uncles and aunts younger than the nephews and nieces
godhatesjack: i dunno, i mean it's not that uncommon for a grandparents to squirt out another kid
SunHitsTheSky777: I get 8.50 an hour. Makes you wanna pick up some barbells, huh?
godhatesjack: but i'll admit, the mexican americans have a knack for it
godhatesjack: not bad
godhatesjack: but i'm sure you'll be earning it
SunHitsTheSky777: in blood
godhatesjack: whenever i imagine meat head movers i just get this picture of beefcake guys in short shorts with shaved heads, no neck, and a white t-shirt with their first name on it 
SunHitsTheSky777: yeah, you pretty much got it there. (minus the shirts)
godhatesjack: that's too bad, the shirts would make it complete"

"event","i have a headache induced by the shiny floors in k-mart.

it's funny how a few days ago i felt like the king. and it's funny how it took a few days for all the bells and whistles and glamour to fade, and now i'm back with thinking about how flawed my life is. 

so the plan is set. in november i leave for colorado. by then ch4 will be frozen while dr. sean is doing the national guard deal. with that, i really have nothing left here in california. 

looks like i'm returning on sunday/monday. returning to what, really...

at least ch4 still has some practices and a show or two to kick out before we go. that's what i'm looking foward to.

and for the record:

i hate bakersfield."

"event","well, as of now i am broadcasting from soledad, which normally i despise but now i love it because it's not bakersfield, which i shall be returning to tomorrow because we're helping my grandma move stuff to her new house.

september 11, bakersfield

first day we got there we drove around looking for family and such. we stayed at dr. sean's aunt's house. great woman. she had a dog named angie. i must admit it induced a smile out of me the entire time i was there. rickey fed her a corn-nut and the dog got sick the next day. 

september 12, jerry's pizza, basement...earth.

third band up, ch4. we did rock in my opinion, and got it on video as proof. it was probably our most responsive crowd, we had cheering and moshing (kinda) and whoah's on the right songs. now i'm convinced the music crowd in santa maria is useless. it's nice to know it's possible for people to appreciate what we're doing.

and that night i decided this is what i want to do for the rest of my life. after we finished our set a couple freshmen looking kids came up to me and one of them told me jerry only was his hero and i said he was mine too and the kid almost hit the ceiling. he and his friend followed me around for the rest of the night telling me how great i was and asked for my autograph. i was pretty damned suprised, and so i gave gave them one even though i thought they were joking. the misfits kid had this huge smile on his face and he said he was gonna tape it onto his bass, then we just talked about the misfits. i seriously just wanted to hug that kid. i don't think i've ever felt that good before about anything i've ever done.

the past few days have been an experience for me. definately life changing. i'd really like to see that video. the band before us, wiggum (wiggumrocks.com) were great guys and stuck around to hear us play. i think they said they were from orange county. 


anyway it looks like i'm gonna be in bakersfield for another week or so. :( ah well. i need sleep now, my neck really hurts. 

get some!"

lots of suprises lately. i really don't feel like talking about them here, though.

on a lighter note:
i have a job interview tomorrow and it would be nice to work again. the other day i bought a book on yoga and i started that and trying to meditate again. i'm astounded at my progress this time around. lately i've been taking everything extremely well and i'm very calm and composed for the most part. i think this is what's keeping me from cracking and going crazy."

"event","i finally saw my misfits on saturday in ventura. it was one of the best things that ever happened to me, jamaica being the best. 

the first three bands sucked, but they were the local bands so i guess that's a given.

d.i. was okay, but really didn't do that much for me. 

the dickies were totally nuts. the singer was amazing. he danced and did aerobics and had a penis puppet.

and balzac...jesus christ balzac totally kicked ass. it was the first time i had ever heard them and they were so damn good. 

the damned were great, but they played a bit too long. the singer totally looked like bruce campell. 

then finally...

THE MISFITS! that was just too good for words. just believe me it was awesome. jerry only, dez (who bears a striking resemblance to turok the dinosaur hunter), and marky ramone (the worst ramone ever). i was kinda disappointed they didn't play longer. after the show i got my ticket signed by jerry, turok, and all the guys from balzac. jerry only is the nicest guy on the planet, i shook his hand and talked to him and took a picture with him. my ears are still ringing and i'm sore from showing the stupid people what for, but it was well worth it."

"event","last nite was mock rock. and in an odd turn of events, we came as close as we could to winning. our name was actually on that check then scribbled out for the winning band's name. 

however, we put on one hell of a show. we all dressed up like zombies and yours truly had the jerry only look going with black lipstick and michael was holding a copy of the necronomicon. when the curtains rose, we had this girl joy scream and run out on stage as we shambled after her, then she pretended to trip we were almost upon her then we saw our instruments and started playing. we played last and rocked that house.

pretty much all the acts that nite were really awesome. i saw a lot of people i hadn't seen in a long time. dustin stone is down from long beach and asked me for my number cause he thinking about starting a band during the time he's here.

man, the closest you'll ever get to another band is the time when you play a competition with them. the commercials and ch4 will soon be playing a show together so keep an ear to the ground. those guys are damn good.

everything's been going pretty good. soon i'll start working and be even happier. and i think today rickey is buying our tickets to what will be the day i descend to a higher level of existance.

"event","i guess you know when you're a good band when other bands try to rip off your songs. 

last nite my band played at some coffee house in morro bay, the playing area was about as big as a bathroom. it wasn't so bad, we drew in people that were just walking by. i'm guessing that was the most people that place had seen in a while. some guy even insisted on video taping us. 

i guess the kicker of the night was this. the other band we played with actually ripped off one of our songs to the note. they took the whole song and put new lyrics to this. i guess to most people this probably isn't a big suprise, but in the music principle of things it's a travesty. and the sad thing was we had just played that song during our set. even dr. sean was pissed (as he clearly expressed with middle fingers and a loud explitive), as were the rest of us. i still don't know exactly what to think of the whole ordeal. some people never change, i suppose."

you very well know for a fact this is how it's going to be you can't lose fate it'll always there like the dog you never wanted always nipping at your heel sure you think if you can speed up a bit you might be able to lose it but you can turn around and sure enough there it is what can you really do but sit there and accept what has happened you realize you probably reached a dead end in life but is there a chance to still turn around sure why not even in a dead end you can always spin a few degrees and you have a new way to go will it be better than the last who knows for sure but it's sure as hell a lot better as your last route look where that took you but then again isn't that what life is you'll always be eternally chosing paths like a lost child but never know if the one your on is the right one you can look back and see what you've left behind and all you'll see is the blood and tears your path has been paved with like all the rest of us but there will only be one set of footprints and that is your own you alone will walk the path and occasionally another will walk with you but not very long before their paths lead them elsewhere in life and you're left back to yourself but then again if you can't walk with yourself who can you walk with but regardless one might choose to follow one another if they belive they mean that much to them it may eventually all be in strife but for that moment in your life you'll have the satisfaction of knowing for that spot in time somebody was with you...

"event","I think I pulled a muscle in my back while doing my sit-ups the other day.  My back kills.  I am so happy though because I lost 5 pounds within 2 1/2 weeks so I am very proud of myself.  

School will be over with in about a month and I am so happy it will be over.  I plan on working throughout the summer so I can work on getting my own place.  My mom has been itching and complaining about how I need to get out on my own two feet and as soon as my brother turns 18 he is out too.  She is on this ""I wanna move on with my life"" trip.  I can understand that.  I tried to move out before and she was all like I don't think u should move in with such an such because I don't think that would be a good idea.  Now I know that I am an adult but I am seriously scared of my mother.  Then just the other day shes all like, ""When I was 21, I was married with a child and a job.""  Ok yea u were but u were also pregnant with another one and on the verge of getting a divorce.  And let's not forget that your second child (my brother) wasn't even by your husband (my dad).  So she's trying to make an example and tell me what she was doing at 21.  I don't wanna be married at he age of 21 with a bunch of children running around.  So as soon as the summer gets here...Miss Brandie is out the door.  I cannot wait.  

I think I have to be the most ignorant person in the world.  I am so blinded by someone's looks that I can't even see when someone is walking all over me.  There's this guy I like by the name of...We'll just call him ""T"".  I met him at a party and we exchanged numbers but we never called one another.  Then I was online one day, about a year later and came across his page on BlackPlanet.  We talked on there and on the phone.  So I'm feeling him and he's feeling me.  And after about three months of being friends and dating, I'm like yea I like and if u need anything just ask and I'll try my best to get it for u...that's just the type of person I am when I get into a friendship/relationship.  If u need it and I have it then I have no problem giving it to u just as long as u do the same for me.  Well I've been giving and giving and I haven't gotten anything in return.  We can both be online and he won't say anything to me and if he does it's always...Can I get $30 when I come down to Detroit from Lansing.  And of course I say yes all the fucking time.  So I have been thinking that I am never going to make someone a priority when they can only make me an option.  So I told him that I don't even want to talk to him anymore because it seems like the only time he's overly nice to me is when he wants something...which is all the time.  I need to get the negative people out of my life."

"event","I've been neglecting my journal again.  Not much has been up with me though...I've just been chillin and enjoying this Michigan weather.  When it gets warm all the cuties come out.  So I was out lookin for them.  Me and my girl didn't have anything else better to do but go cruise up 7 mile looking for guys.  It was fun though.  I met a few people...got a few numbers, so I had a pretty good day.  I saw one of my ex-boyfriends while I was out today too.  He looked to cute.  I almost forgot why we broke up in the first place.  He gave me his number and told me to call him.  I'm not to sure if I want to call though, he might want to start some things that I really don't want right now.  Maybe he was just being friendly though.  IDK...maybe I should just call.  

I saw Dre...my brother's barber.  OMG that man is gorgeous.  I went and got like 8 CDs that I didn't need just so I could see him before he goes out of town.  He's all like...So when are u coming over so I can cook u dinner?  I'm standing there all weak in the knees and everything.  I'm like whenever u come back from Atlanta.  So I cannot wait until next weekend.  He is to cute.

My birthday is in 11 days and I will be the big 21...I cannot wait.  I might be having a party but I'm not to sure just yet.  I want to rent this hall but I have to get a DJ, photographer, and a caterer.  And if I do I have to make myself really friendly because if I were to have it in 2 weeks...there would be like 70 guys and like 8 girls.  Not good at all.  So I have to invite some girls from school and tell them to bring a friend cause I do not want my party to be lame.  So I need to get on my p's and q's.

Well enough for tonite...I just realized that it is 10 mins to 12.  Nite Nite Kiddies!!!!!!!!"

"event","OMG...I am such a freakin procrastinator. I have class at 8:30 in the morning and I haven't done any of my homework. I've missed two classes...one before and one after spring break. So I must attend this one. And the thing is...this is for my major. But I had to make sure that I posted this. 

Today my ex best friend came over to my house asking if she could stay with me until she found a place to stay since her boyfriend (my ex) put her out. I'm like WTF??? No...u better go back and stay with your mother. My mom told me I was being mean and vindictive. I don't think so. Now if we were still girls I would have no problem with letting her stay at my place for awhile. My mom is like, ""She has a baby though."" And just like I said, she can go stay with her mother. So when I told her that she couldn't stay with me she went off on me like ""THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT"", calling me all out my name and everything. NO NO honey...u brought this all on yourself. I may have had a small part in this but u can't blame everything on me. Then to make matters worse, my ex decides to drop by my house...after he sends me flowers and a invitation to dinner while I'm at work. Still don't know if I wanna accept that or not. As soon as he walks in she turns to me like...""I see u didn't take no time getting with my man."" No this chick didn't. So to prevent shit from getting broken in my house, I politely ask the lil wench to leave. She's cussing all the way to the cab she had to catch over here since he took the car from her. Then I have to inform him that it is not polite to drop by without calling me first. I could have been busy with some other things. He notices the flowers on my table and is like, ""I take it u liked the flowers?"" I'm like, ""Yea I like them."" Then he starts talking about me and him and how we need to talk about our relationship. I had to stop him right there. ""We don't have a relationship or did u forget?"" He's like, ""but we had sex yesterday and that's how we always used to make up when we had a argument."" Like I said did u forget that u were dating my girl...not for a few weeks but for a few months. That's a big NO NO in my book. I'm like you're lucky that I'm even talking to u now, anybody else wouldn't get that privilege. So then he starts talking all this crap about how he has realized that he did me wrong and he wants me back. And for a min I believe him and I think about saying yes we can get back together...but then I'm like WTF is wrong with me??? If he did it once he will do it again. But the thing is, I didn't think he would do it in the first place. I thought I knew him. We've been friends since we were like one years old. So I'm a lil confused on what to do...if I should get back with him or just say screw u and go on about my life. I would really like some input on this."

"event","I have just realized that everything that I say about guys turns about to be true.  Well not all guys but at least the ones I know and talk to.  They are some good liars.  My ex and my ex best friend are dating now and me and him had sex today.  Now I know that's not cool at all but I didn't have sex with him to piss her off.  But that's what he told her.  He said that I called him and begged him to come over to my house and when he got here I was all over him telling him that I wanted to get back at her so let's have sex.  OMG!!!  And the thing that really got to me was the fact that this broad believed all this BS.  This girl has known me for what...seven years and she's been dating him for all of 8 months and she believes him and not me.  Me and her were like sisters and she should know that I am not that type of person.  I tried to explain to the girl that it wasn't even like that.  I wasn't even thinking about trying to hurt her when all of this was going down...I was horny so I was thinking about me and my own needs.  Maybe that's it right there.  I was only thinking of myself.  So she's all up in my face...she had the nerve to come to my house and try to start shit with me.  She's all like I can't believe u did me like this...u know how much I love him...and blah blah blah blah blah.  So I listen to this chick rant and rave for a good 5 mins and then I had to remind her that she was my best friend but she violated the only rule we had within our friendship...she straight took my man from me.  It would be different if we wre broken up but we were still together when she fucked him.  So actually she didn't take him from me...I was just pissed that I didn't want to be bothered with either one of them.  She then goes on to tell me how much they love eachother and all this non-sense while he's standing there looking stupid and shaking his head while she's talking.  Then he comes right out and tells thise whore that he knows she's been fucking other guys so he wanted to get back at her.  Now I'm standing there like OMG this nigga used me to get back at her.  I'm like are u serious????  He tells her that he doesn't love her and he never did...he was just there because he didn't want to see her and her child out on the street.  So she's standing there looking all stupid and everything.  Then he tells her that he's giving her until the 31st to have all her shit out of his house and he wants the keys to everything.  I could not believe it at all.  I have been knowing this guy all my life...we used to take baths together and I have never seen him so upset in my life.  Oh and he apologized to me.  Not that it's going to fix things between me and him.  He's like I wasn't trying to use u or anything like that but I will call u later and we will talk about some stuff.  I'm like yea, whatever.  I don't have time for all this high school stuff.  But I'm confused because he is my childhood friend and some may say he's my soulmate but why in the hell would he do me like that in the first place.  Not only did he cheat on me but he did it with my girl.  So I'm just feeling a lot of different things right now."

He ask if he can come over to bring me some fliers to pass out for him. I think nothing of it so I say yes. I'm trying to be mature about this situation since he is dating my used to be friend. Long story short...he comes over and we have sex. I seriously don't know what happened. In my head I'm thinking this is so wrong but I do it anyway. So after we do the do and he leaves, I'm thinking to myself...did I just do that to get back at his girl??? I really wasn't thinking about her though. It's not like I said to myself or him that we should have sex so I can piss ya girl off. He then called me and was like I don't plan on telling her what happened if u don't. I don't know if I should call and tell her or just let it go. I think if i do tell her she just might think that I'm lying or trying to break them up. So I'm a lil confused about that one.</FONT>"

He then told me that he is also attracted to me.  I then went on to tell him that I am sexually attracted to him also.  I thought that would be a bad idea but it really wasn't.  He told me that he had a girlfried a few months ago when I tried to talk to him and that he wanted to make sure he was over that before he got into another relationship.  So I'm like are u ready to be in a relationship?  And he's like yea...with u.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm sitting there speechless because I didn't think he was feeling like that.  So we made a date for this weekend to talk about some stuff and get to know each other a lil better than we do now.  He invited me over to his house and he wants to cook me dinner.  Now I don't want to rush into anything but um...he wants to cook me dinner so I plan on hanging on to this one.  He works, has is own place, no children (not that there is anything wrong with that), his own car (two actually), goes to school, and he can cook.  HE'S A KEEPER!!!!!!!!"

"event","I took a lil nap today so I feel refreshed.  It's like 11:30 and I'm not even sleep.  I joined a community on here hoping that I will meet some cool people to converse with because I am getting a little bored with the people I talk to now.  It seems like everyone that I meet seems to want something from me.  I am not feeling that at all.  I've known this one guy for all of a week and on the third day of me knowing him he ask me to buy him some Jordans.  UM NO!!!!!!!!!  What do I look like...your mother?  I'm like you'll get some when I get some and since they don't look right on my feet that means I won't be getting any and neither will u.  So needless to say I erased his number out of my phone.  Just because I work all the time doesn't mean that I wanna spend my money on a dude.  They need to be buying me something and if they do then I will open up my wallet and spend some cash on them."

"event","I am so bored in this class and I have a kille headache.  So I'm trying to get into this whole school thing...I always wait to do my homework or write a paper the day before it's due.  I know that's not good but I think something is seriously wrong with me.  OMG!!!!  I'm getting money back from financial aid and my mom is all like...""I hope u don't think you're just gonna blow that check"".  NO MOM, I'm not.  She's all like I want my money back from when I helped u get your car fixed.  No shit.  Did u think I forgot??  I didn't forget about paying u your money back or anyone else.  And she says that I'm money hungry.  Well right now I am because I am unemployed at the moment.  And I try to make money by burning CDs...which I know is illegal, but everytime I go to burn them half of my CDs are gone.  And y is that u ask?  Because my brother likes to take them and burn music for all these hoodrat ass girls and his low-life friends...FOR FREE.  So i get pissed and tell him that if he's gonna burn the music at least get my money for them.  So I get called money hungry because I'm  trying to make some money but I can't because my brother is giving away my product.  WTF?????  I cannot wait until I go to an out of state school.  

There is this guy I am like so infatuated with but he's not feeling me like that just yet.  Well he says one thing but does another and it really irritates me.  Like when he's online I'll send him a IM and it'll take him like 3 mins just to respond to a hello.  And then he'll just ignore me.  When he comes to Detroit from Lansing he's all calling me asking me to come over to where he's at and bring him this and buy him that.  And now that I'm sitting here reading what I just typed...I realize that I am being used.  OMG!!!!  This is not cool.  Just like my best friend says...DON'T TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING!!!  That's exactly what I'm doing."

I could say work but where I was working decided that they wanted to let a bunch of people go and I was one of them.  So I've been without a job for about a month and a half now.  It sucks.  I've gotten a lil lazy while sitting at the computer looking for a job.  Well I gotta go...will write more later."

I will get to see my sister and my aunt, uncle, and little terrors of cousins... It shall be great fun, and I shall hopefully get my phone fixed. the driving is the only part I'm not to excited about, but tis a little price to pay for all the fun I will have.&nbsp;<br /><br />Is it bad when you don't go home, because you just don't want to deal with your roommates anymore? Or you go home when you know they aren't there, or they're already asleep so you don't have to deal with them? I feel sooo horribly mean, but I can't help it. I love people and I don't really think that living by myself would help anything next year, but I am seriously considering getting a single dorm next year instead of living out in the villages again. I just don't wan to deal with it anymore. Am I a horrible person because&nbsp;of it? I don't even really have a problem with one of them right now, but I just don't want to go home when they're there...<br /><br />I have decided, I am horrible, I should work on that. I shouldn't avoid them, it's my apt. too and I shouldn't let them drive me from it. (I'm stilling thinking of living by myself though next year)</p>"

"event","So Christmas break wasn't too shabby. I enjoyed it. I got to see some people...the ones that love me anyways...I'm just joking.&nbsp;

Interesting stories though have come out of it. For example, I have come to learn that my little cousin refers to Santa as Ho Ho. This is all fine and cute, but I don't think that any one should go around saying ""I went and saw Ho Ho."" Some people wouldn't take it as Santa. Another interesting fact I have come to find is that one of my other little cousins agrees with me that boys have cooties. This being interesting due to the fact that he is a boy. I love my family.

I've also come to the conclusion that the cops in Algona need to find something to occupy their time with.&nbsp;I'm highly entertained by the fact that a cop had the time to pull me over to tell me that my car was&nbsp;dirty. I may have glasses and have to wear them at night to drive, but I could see that my car was dirty. I don't believe that it was as dirty as he believed it to be, but the cops are always right...or so they think. I have to say though, that I&nbsp; am impressed that they are such caring citizens that they will go out of their way to tell me the obvious. And just to set the record straight, my car is maroon, not red; the officer couldn't tell the difference, I guess, under all that dirt...ha ha ha.&nbsp;

love to all, merry late Christmas, and happy new year!"

"event","Ok some most people don't care, but I'm happy so I'm going to post. 
I PASSED MY MUSIC THEORY II TEST!!!! and yes i know most of you are like...huh? ok sure...that's ok. Just to give a little in-sight on my maddness, it's a required class for my major, and if I don't receive an B in this class my prof. will make me retake it. This wouldn't be horrible besides the fact that I wouldn't be able to retake it until next year spring semester, and I am required to take 2 more semesters of theory classes after this one. It is a very difficult class and I don't think I've ever studied harder for a test in awhile...if ever. 

Ok now that I've had my little happy dance. Just basic happenings, I am now a MIT for SAI (memeber in training) this is a music frat. on campus. Hopefully this will give me the connections I will need for a music performance job later in life. (crosses fingers) 

I am still a tech asst. and a math tutor, so I work 4 days out of the week, not to shabby since I don't have to work weekends. 

I joined a dance club. Haven't had a meeting yet or any dancing, but I'm excited. I love to dance, and my roommate, Shannon for those who don't know her (it's ok, I still love you), also joined so that makes me double excited cause she doesn't care for dancing, so maybe she'll change her mind!

I guess I should get going though and do something productive.

"event","So I should be doing my homework right now, but I just don't want to, I've been working on it all day so far. Therefore I can take some time to write because I haven't in awhile. 

Ok so a funny story, at least it was funny to me, I hope you all find it funny or it's going to become one of those ""you had to be there's""... anyways.
So Jillian (one of my suitmates) and I were sitting in the plaza doing homework one day, and around 7:30 it starts to get dark and cooler outside. Of course we decide to go back to our dorm to get sweatshirts before our meeting at 8:45 and continue our homework inside. So we're walking back to our rooms, and the fastest way to get back to Gilmore (our dorm) is through the Toner Center; well we just happen to pass campus safety on our way to our dorm and it just happens that we know the students workers there at this moment. We therefore stop to talk to them, and campus safety is great even the regular workers (non-students) joke around and talk to us all the time and have very interesting ideas... Anyways so we start talking to one of the guys working that we know and we jokingly tell him that we need a ride to our dorm (which is maybe a 3 minute walk from where we are) because it's getting dark and cold outside and we feel ""unsafe"". Of course they just laugh at us and we're laughing ourselves. So the guy we're talking to asks the head worker (non-student worker) guy if he can drive us back to our dorm, and all the head guy says is ""do you have a licence?"" and then he gives him the keys to the campus safety van. So we get a rid back to our dorm which using the road takes 10 minutes instead of the 4 it would have walking. Of course we had him drive us right up to the door because we could be jumped the last few yards to the dorm...
So we get dropped off and we go in laughing and just sit down to do our homework when Fallon (my other suitmate) calls and needs us to come and meet her in Toner Center...so of course we go right back, and we pass campus safety...
The guy who has just given us the ride has just gotten back and sat down, the head worker guy looks from us to the guy who just got back with a very puzzled look on his face and then both him and the guy who just gave us the ride burst out laughing. Of course, we wave and later explained why we were back so soon and that we don't want the guy who gave us the ride to get in trouble. The head guy was all ok with it though and pretty much thought we were a couple of ""blondes"" and laughed at us again. But I can't say I wasn't laughing myself because it was rather humorous.

"event","All I have to say is that tegrity sucks, and whoever was the idiot who thought it up should be drug out into the streets and shot!

So I found out yesterday that I am required to buy this tegrity pen, cradle, notebooks, and program for my principles management class, and I LOATH IT.  I'm sorry but why the heck do I need to buy a freakin pen that will cost me over $100 just to put my freakin notes onto my computer?! I don't want them on my computer for one and I don't want to install this program on my computer either. I understand that it is suppose to help students go back in their notes and see what happened during class (I will be able to watch my class on my computer now to) but if I'm taking notes I can follow along either way and not install it or pay the $! I don't see how they think this is soooooooooo good; it's only going to encourage students to not go to classes because they can just watch them anytime they want on their computer. Why go to class when you don't have to?

I don't really see how this tegrity is going to help me in anyway shape or form. I'm going to e-mail my teacher and ask if there is any possible way I don't have to get it...even though it is required for the course. I DON'T WANT TO BUY IT!

Maybe I'm just whining and should just mellow and buy it, but I dare say I will never use it...so what's the point?

I don't know. I guess I should get back to work; checking on the tegrity software...idiots."

"event","I have 2 finals left!!!!! (happy dance) Then I shall be able to come home! I can't wait to go home, but I'm going to miss people here. It's sooo weird. Sara left this afternoon, and who's going to sleep on our floor tonight?! Seriously, I had 2 roommates this year, and one has already left me. Sadly Sara won't be coming back next year, so we ate ice cream and made a day of it even though it was/is raining.

We took a lot of pictures and yeah, thinking about it...it's really weird how Sara and I became friends. It's really not explainable. At the beginning of the year (when Shannon went home all the time) I would sit and eat meals with her on the weekend, and sometimes during the weekdays also. Idn it's just really weird. It wasn't just a random meeting where you hang out all the time afterwards it just happened. Wack. 

I haven't up dated in a while, but there isn't much to say that I haven't written before. Friends are still friends, jerks are still jerks, and some people never grow up. I haven't learned this, but had it proven to me once again. Oh well, I dare say some of them will never speak to me again. But it is again by my choice not theirs...

So I have this blister on my pointer finger and it really hurts and it popped today, and all this pus came out and now I have a band aid on it. I can't bend my finger because the blister is right by my joint, but I'll be ok. I wish I knew where it came from though...that might help explain why it's so big and close to my joint. 

Hummm I'm just babbling now, so I guess I shall stop and hopefully I shall see you all soon, then you can hear my great stories! (you poor people, I'm sorry you have to put up with me!)"

Anyways, for all you peoples I didn't get to see or talk to over break, here is an up date. I finally have a summer job, part time but not going to complain, at Computer Systems Associates. And yes I do happy dance. Family Table said that they would talk to me at the beginning of May (I applied there too) and I was going to talk to them and see if I could work there the hours I wouldn't be at CSA. That would be great! A lot of running around for me, but I need the money! I will also be working at Hillside again for my aunt and uncle so hopefully I won't have any problems (money wise). 

I also now have a car...or will have one, or am in the prossess of buying one...how ever you want to look at it. I am buying my grandparents' car, very nice car too. They were going to trade it in with their pick-up for a newer pick-up. Well then I came home and grandpa was talking to me (and he's tried to sell me every vehical he's ever gotten rid of) and he got on the subject of his car and said that I needed a car...maybe I should buy this one from him. He'd rather get the money from me instead of Kemna, so yeah. That's kinda how it went. 

Wow, I didn't have much to say in the end did I? Oh well, I guess that will have to do. I hope to see many, if not all, of you during summer break, and I miss you all!"

so i met with my new advisor yesterday, dr. h. and we figured out my schedule for next year or for the fall. yay. i guess. and she pointed out to me that all the people above me in the clarinet section are seniors...cough cough yeah. so i really need to keep up with my practicing over the summer so i'm not a horrid player when i come back. 
i also registar for classes tonight...yes i will start stressing over that soon enough, but first i have to give my speech in oral com. one stress at a time...and lovin brian scheduled me to work today during my only free time until like 8 tonight...yeah. so i'm now at work and shall be until 10 minutes before i give my speech. not a good idea for me.
i'm also very tired because, as many of you know, i am a math tutor and i have been informed by the people that i tutor, there is a big math test tomorrow. and at least 3 of them are freaking out about it so i'm getting calls and stopped in the hallways to help them outside of tutoring one on one to pass this test. and that's what i did last night for 3 hours...i wonder if joe (my tutoring boss) would allow me to put that on my time sheet and get paid for it. right now i'm going out of my way to help and not writing the times down...i should ask him.
i need to concentrate on getting my speech outline down though so i shall say farewell and hope to see most of you during easter break!"

that would include writing a paper, organizing a speech with my group, studying with gosia, and reviewing ear training exercises. i need to do my history of the bible worksheet but since my teacher didn't give it back to me i shall have to hunt her down tomorrow and get it.then i shall sign up for a meeting with dr. fox my advisor to get rid of her...that sounds mean...to switch advisors and to declare my major and form my schedule for next year.

on a bright note, shannon and i have found suitmates, jillian (i may have told a few of you about her, she lives in ed's;) and fallon (met her at beginning of semester, she's in my oral com class and also in my speech group, i get along with her well so i dare say i won't have problems)also jillian has the status of a sophmore so we shall have first pick of the freshman for sophmore dorms. that means we will almost possitively get a room in gilmore where we were hoping to live in next year. yay i hope everything works out with registaring for it.

sara also received the good news that she has been accepted at oshcosch...i dare say i didn't spell that right...and she will be going there next year...i'm happy for her that she has gotten in and it will help her in her new major...but i dare say shannon and i will miss her next year and i wish she wouldn't leave me(us), but we will go and visit her and she will visit us so hopefully we won't be at a total lose without her here on campus...tear"

Anyways, yesterday was buddies (that a group I'm in that plays games, colors, talks with, whatever with the mentally handicap of the Winona community) and I'm playing soccer with a bunch of them and some other volunteers and well lo and behold...I get smoked in the face by the soccer ball. It probably was comical, I will admit it probably did look hilarious. I might laugh at it later but right now it just doesn't seem that funny. I at least don't have a black eye, that would be great, the left side of my face is a little swollen but I don't think it's very noticable.

i had a great break with not many catastrophic happenings, which is good and bad at the same time. i have nothing really to write about since this is true but i don't have anything extra to worry about either. 
i think i'm just rambling now...
i received many christmas cards when i got back today and checked my mail box. many commented on my cards that i had sent out... i love mail and i was very excited. i was very tempted to take just one out and leave the rest. therefore i could take one out each day and have mail for a few days in a row and then i won't have an empty mail box to go and visit everyday. i did not though since i wanted to read all of the wonderful letters and put up all of the pictures that came with. so i shall be visiting an empty box tomorrow but i guess today was a good mail day.
i believe that my mail box is spiteful. seriously the boxes next to mine always have mail in them. you could think that it's just that the people don't check their boxes as often as me, but that is not so. i see different mail in them everyday and they receive many packages. they may send them to themselves, but i'm tempted to that same thing so i can't say much about that subject. 
wouldn't it be interesting to get mail from yourself? seriously, you could write to yourself and not waste postage because it is in school mail, and telling yourself interesting stories and remind yourself of appointments, and tell yourself what you did that day (I don't know about you but i sometimes have a hard time remembering that) and all that great stuff. and you wouldn't have to put the return address on it so no one would know it was you sending it and they would get jealous of you instead of the other way around...just think about that. i should try it and see how long it takes shannon and sara to realize who is sending it to me. (not very long) they will probably after awhile want to know who it's from and read it over my shoulder and then it's all over. well not really but oh well. life needs a little drama.
well i hope you all enjoyed my...interesting (to say the most) ramblings. i shall go and find sometime more...educational to do...or think about finding something more educational to do...."

"event","<P>So it's snowing outside, but it's not suppose to snow today....right. It's all ok though because I don't have to drive anywhere and I love the snow! For example, I'm walking to dinner today with Sara and Shannon and what does mature me do? I make a snow ball and throw it at Sara of course! What else would a mature person do? So we're throwing snow and Shannon backs away....(that's just asking to get hit) Pat just then comes out&nbsp;of the library and starts talking to me so I stop throwing and Sara stops also (with a snowball still in her hand) and poor Shannon deemed it safe to come back. Let's just say Sara doesn't have that snowball anymore, and Shannon was wet....oooppps. </P>
<P>Shannon blames me because I threw the first snowball and I just don't see how it was my fault....oh well I would have hit her with one had Sara not. So I am guilty...somewhat....</P>
<P>So I don't get to come home for Christmas until the 20th and that sucks....but I will be home until the 9th of January so people we should do something....cough cough. Inform me of when you will all be home and we'll somehow all get together....hopefully. I know I don't have a cell phone...well with good range (paper and scotch tape doesn't reach far) but people call my home phone! If&nbsp; I'm not home I'll call you back! I'm serious that's what an answering machine is for talk to me! </P>
<P>Miss you all! Hope to see you around Christmas! (well of course you won't be able to call me Caroline, but you called me during Thanksgiving and we ate chinese, LUV YA!)</P>"

Why do people pull ""all nighters"" then on the weekdays when they have classes the next day? I guess I really shouldn't care what they do, but when they pull an ""all nighter"" I usually end up staying awake most of the night too. These loving people on both sides of me LOVE to pull ""all nighters"" and even have a ""club"" for it.

<P><EM><FONT color=#3333ff>Well besides that life isn't all dooms and glooms. I was kicked out last weekend as I'm sure most of you already know. Therefore I went home and visited my family.

Yeah go you people.&nbsp;Now that I'm back, my P.E. has started (raquetball) and my first day of class was at most 5 minutes long...I wonder if all of them will be that long...I doubt it.

"event","<FONT color=#003300>yeah so i'm at work again and i'm sitting here and i finished opening the labs like maybe 5 minutes ago. i have power like that, don't you know? i have a key to get into the helpdesk and any computer lab at any time. why do i have this key? don't worry i didn't steal it or anything (which probably wouldn't be that hard, i wouldn't know though) i received it from brian because i ""open up"" every Monday and Friday and every other Wednesday. yeah go me. so i have to have a key or i couldn't do my job and that would be horrible...right. so i think i had a point to all that but i forgot what it was so i guess there won't be a point to that paragraph after all. i'm sorry. well i guess i could just erase it and start over but what's the point? i'd forget all over again and i don't think i'm going to remember it anyways. so yeah i'm coming home in a week yeah go me. you all want to know why? well i guess it doesn't matter if you want to know why or not because i'm going to tell you and if you don't want to know i guess you'll just have to stop reading this won't you? so yeah i almost just forgot what i was typing about again. anyways so i'm coming home in a week because the school is kicking me out. literally. if you don't live more than 8 hours away or are required to stay because of a sport you have to leave campus. and they are going to change the locks and ""supposedly"" taking our keys so we can't get in...hummmm i would say they're going a bit too far there but it's not my call and maybe someone really actually would want to stay when they could go home...hahahaha poor lost person who would want to. maybe they would have a reason though so i guess whatever. and caroline is coming up here and i get to go home with her and that is freakin awesome. i heart you caroline and yeah. so this guy mike something (i don't feel like looking at how to spell his last name) was suppose to come in on Wednesday when i worked because i guess he's new and brian wanted him to working in the morning...whatever so he was suppose to come in and didn't show up and jason walks in and is like hey are you the only one working? isn't someone else suppose to be coming in? and i'm like ummm this mike guy was suppose to come in at 8 (just so there is no confusion i work mornings from 7-9 so he was suppose to come in half way through my shift) and he's not here yet (again so no confusion-when this conversation took place it was 8:30) so jason calls him up and is like wtf. this mike guy is like oh i didn't know and i'm not going to come in today. so jason is upset and doesn't like this kid now. oh well so this mike guy calls back after like 5 minutes to talk to jason so i transfer the call. he tells jason that he is going to come in today (what was Wednesday not today as in friday even though he's suppose to work today too)and yeah jason comes back in here right around 9 because i'm leaving and he's like didn't mike show up and i'm like ummm no...and he's like humm he said he was going to... so yeah we'll see if he shows up today. oh well doesn't matter to me if he does or not i'm not that busy in the mornings and the pro staff will help out if i need them to. but the funny thing is though that luke was suppose to take over for me at 9 and i didn't see him either. he's usually here before i leave or i meet him on my way out but i didn't see him at all so maybe it was skip work day and i just didn't get the memo...or i guess just be late to work day...either way it was odd yeah nothings really changed here i'm sorry to say school's school and it's finally getting cooler up here. i don't see why people are saying it's freezing out it's going to get a lot colder. i think it's really nice outside all you need is jeans and a sheatshirt. perfect weather. but maybe i'm just odd not like i haven't been told that before. oh well i guess i don't have much else to write. i wrote longer than i thought i would though so snaps to me </FONT>"

now that we have that established. for all of you peoples that talk to me on msn don't worry about me getting kicked off anymore. nothing $ couldn't fix...yeah i was happy about that. but anyways yeah the wireless network just kept getting worse and i couldn't get on at all most of the time or i was given like 5 minutes and then it kicked me off again...so i decided screw it i need the internet because brian is smart...i'll explain that later. so anyways i go down to the help desk and buy a freakin' ethernet cable and switched my computer over to that and turned off my wireless. yes it was nice not having an extra cord, but it was that or no internet...so yeah now i'm not having problems so go me.
now on to ""smart"" brian. he is my boss and has scheduled me for the 3 TIME!!! to work during a class...yeah that's my smart boss, i've told him the last two times in person that i can't work then but this time i didn't think that i could do that without him realizing that i'm a little annoyed, to put it nicely...so i wrote him a nice e-mail and if he does it again...it might not be put so nicely to him. and he might realize that i have a nasty temper when pissed off. 
oh well, so i'm tired and it's sunday!!!!!!!! yeah so you know what that means?!.... I got to eat a waffle for dinner!!!!!!! (no not supper for those of you that think i talk weird) because they don't have a breakfast and dinner here for the weekend they have brunch. and that means waffles!!!!!!!! yeah ones you can make yourself so they're actually good. yeah it's good but then the supper (yes SUPPER) sucks so i guess it kinda evens itself out. but the waffles are awesome just to let everyone else know. because you are all going to come here and eat the food right....
anyways i watched robin hood today the cool awesome cartoon one from disney yeah the one we grew up with. yeah it was awesome and that's about it. because i don't have much to write about. oh i went grocery shopping today and got milk, popcorn, crackers, and dr. pepper and wow i never realized how much milk i drank until i got here. i drink a lot of milk so i buy it by the gallon and not by the quart so i think people think i'm a freak...what's new? oh well i think i'm going to take a nap. or try to....yeah we'll see how that happens. i love couches whoever invented them was a genious. yeah and i'm coming home to see everybody in 19 days!!!!!!!!!!!!! go band day i'm sooooo excited.

(weird times i know)so all the other movies are over and we don't see the other people and we're like WTF? because we're 6 frshmen in the middle of Winona in the middle of the night. and we're sitting in the lobby of the theater thinking WTF and so finally the workers come up to us and are like are you guys waiting for the ""safe bus"" (yeah that is seriously what they call it. so that when college kids get drunk and plastered they have a ride back to campus) and we're like umm yeah. they tell us quite kindly that the bus doesn't stop here after it drops you off...you have to walk 2 blocks to get to the bus pick up place. ok so they tell us where to go and it's in the middle of all these bars...yeah drunk people all the way. 
well i guess i should have started out with this but it makes more sense here but it's out of order. so a few days before we had to go to this sex signals talk (freshmen thingy had to go) and it stated that most people think rape is some scary guy in a dark alley jumping out from behind a dumpster, bush, tree, shrubbery, mail box you name it. so me thinking that's funny because that could happen but not likely. i joke about it all the time and just periodically when i'm walking i yell out ""Tree, bush, shrubbery, mail box, light, dark, sidewalk (no alleys) and so on.
so back to the theater/bus problem. on the walk to the bus stop i start this game, and go figure we pass a dark alley with a dumpster and some trees by it. so i'm having a ball maiking fun of this and all of a sudden the girl next to me starts jumping around and squealing telling me to stop.... i realize that she is one of those people that believes that all rapes come from behind odd objects in the dark. and i found this even funnier, but i bit my tongue and didn't scare her anymore. and talked about how that probably wouldn't happen and if you did get raped good chances are you knew the guy. (i wouldn't find that comforting but i guess some do) anyways so we finally get to the bus stop and all the other peole are there and we're like ok we're good we're safe. and we sit there on our little corner in a group watching all the drunks go by and then we get on the bus and see a few more drunks hitching a ride back to winona state (this is the safe bus for both campus's) so yeah no more making fun of drunks on the way home... but we did after they got off because the one couldn't walk and it was funny. so yes it was dramatic just because it was the middle of the night and it was funny. and i didn't get back to campus until around 12 midnight yeah go me and i couldn't fall back asleep after like 6 but i refused to get out of bed until like 8:30 so i was proud of myself. i guess 
and i hope everyone enjoyed my story and if you didn't well that's just to dan' bad. 
the end
oh wait just to give everybody the heads up i'm coming home with Rosalind for band day so if you're coming home or going to be home then let me know people
now really the end 
oh wait i got a couch now to so for all you peps that i said could live in my closet you can use the couch too but only when i'm not
and you can also live under shannon's bed (they're bunked or it'd be mine), under my desk or yeah i think that's it
i'm serious this time the end"

I'm in training to be a tech ass. and well it's interesting...to say the most it will be better when people actually get here. i'm sorry but i'm a social person and there's no one here!!!!! grrr oh well only 3 days left then everybody else comes. my computer is still having problems and i think it's the network because a lot of other people are having the same problems as me so i don't feel that bad. but i definately don't like computers any more than i did before i started and i hate being stuck in a basement with no windows all day i just want to go outside. well there are some really nice trails up on the bluffs that i went up on sunday but i haven't had time to go back because you can't go up in the dark... so i know i'm babbling but i just thought that if people were bored they might like to read so babble for entertainment....right... oh well i think break is over so i better get back to stupid computer training....fun. miss you all"

"event","ok sooo i told everyone (well who was there) that i would wirte a journal entry and write this really great story in it...
ok so the story is pointless and you wouldn't get it unless you were there or if someone explains it to you and even then i don't know if you'll understand because i had a hard time remembering and i was there.
so anyway i played 4 square and it was lots of fun Theresa slapped Nate's butt, Austin chased Samantha around (i didn't know she could run that fast), and Renee was being a jerk and pushing Nate around so Nate kicked her in the butt. 
yeah so how many people actually understood that? around 4. but that's all ok.
so i saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and well Johnny Depp is hott and the movie was awesome and Johnny Depp is awesome and i'm buying the movie when it comes out and forcing everyone i can to watch it again and again and again with me. sigh
 so to update i got the job for college so i'll be leaving a week earlier than i was suppose to (that would mean the 20th) and i'll write my phone # and address on livejournal when i get there so you can all call me and send me presents or letters will do, to cure me from maddness because i won't have a room mate for a week she'll move in a week later. and people will have to come and visit me at college and i'll try to visit other people also but without a car it might be hard but i shall try. and caroline you have to come before you go to texas. because i said so and even though that's not a great excuse it works. and theresa i think you should come up and visit me too and hopefully your ride won't break and you'll be stuck and well i wouldn't mind you staying longer but that is fustrating. and everyone else with a car and licence has to come and visit me too and yeah. 
i like sherly temples."

"event","so old story but i don't think any of you know it yet...
so on sunday...it was sunday wasn't it? oh well when i'm coming home i see a dead deer and i'm like oh poor thing it got hit i hope i don't see a live one and hit it...so i look farther down the road and go figure there's one standing there on the edge of the road and there's a car coming from the other way i'm like shish so i slow down while thinking if i hit this dumb deer it's the middle of the freaking night it will take forever for someone to stop if they could see me and i have no way of contacting anyone. and do i really want those people stopping anyway i mean it is the middle of the night... so the deer looks up at me and i know it's going to run but smart little deer that it is it runs back into the ditch. ok so i built up for a climax that wasn't there but did you really want me to hit that deer? it was manily the fact the my cell phone sucks...just laugh. 
so i get home and of course i go to tell my parents that i'm home because i have to and i'm suppose to so i walk into the house and set my stuff down (awesome johnny depp poster! i heart u katelyn!) and i go to wake them up...the door is locked...hummmmmm so i knock...nothing....i try the door again....locked.
my parents have locked me out of their room and i don't know why so after sitting there for 5 minutes trying to figure out what to do i go to bed. i know that they realized that i didn't wake them at 5:30 in the morning because mom comes bursting into my room to make sure i was home...? and tells me that she doesn't know why she locked the door she had done it because she had gone to check on dorothy around 10...and she had to have been the one who did it...ok...my parents locked me out i mean seriously if they didn't want me to come home they just had to tell me...just kinding...
and that's the end of my story.

so just to let everyone know i just got in from helping dad and rosalind took a shower first because she has to go to algona so i'm waiting for the shower because i smell. but that's ok. 
dorothy is watching elmo's world and it's stupid ok seseme street was ok not my favorite but this is nasty like next to new version cartoons just wrong something that should never have happened and who ever thought that they should...should themselves be drug out into the street and shot. i guess that since i'm not watching it and i can just hear it in the other room and i don't watch much tv. my whole dilema is kinda besides the point but oh well for those of u who watch more tv. than me (almost everyone) that complaint was all for u even though i doubt any of u watch iptv on a regular basis or even know if u have the channel. 
rosalind is out of the shower...i think i shall go and take a shower. (good story yes i know)

townmart has it's ice cream machine up and running now yummmm i luv ice cream i and wanted some soooo bad today and we didn't have any at home so when i went to work i was like yes and no no no...
reasons for the yess no no no
#1 i luv ice cream
#2 i waste my $ on this ice cream but only when it's vanilla but it's soo good
#3 i hate it when people ask me to make the cones for them
#4 i hate cleaning the stupid machine every night
and then we have a new rug that's good but the vaccume is really bad so it doesn't clean it so yeah definately have to use a barn broom to clean the rug how sad is that? comical if it wasn't me but it is so not funny.
i'm glad i'm out i'm sorry to all those people who aren't but i have a lot to do at home but i just don't like doing it but i have been working all day for the past 2 days and not taking a nap during the day like i could because i'm the only one in the house. and seriously who calls someone at 10:30 in the morning and is like i'm bored u should come over... hummmmm let me think ah no. so i didn't ha ha well i did but at like 2:10 so i had to leave for work right away...that wasn't on purpose or anything...oh well i kept my word anyway so that's all that matters right? right.

"event","the day is almost here and i can't wait. it's not a happy yes! it's kind of a what am i waiting for...there's nothing in this school worth staying for...nothing it can teach me or give me that i'll want why do i have to wait so long? the things i love from this school r coming with me and i won't let them go. friends, memories, knowledge... it'll all come with me and nothing can take it away. what's the point of crying at graduation? i'll still see all of you during the summer and those i don't...well sorry to say it but i don't care if i do or not then because that means i really didn't know you or like you in the first place.
the truth hurts but i was never a good lier in the beginning. sorry people but i can't lie. i can try but people can see that i'm not telling the truth and the truth in the end, is always known. so what's the point? exspecially when it's to ur parents. don't worry i haven't lied to my parents or gotten in a fight with them for quite a long time. i'm just mussing.
the house is almost clean for graduation and a lot of people aren't coming...i don't know how i'm suppose to respond to that i want them to come but i can't get mad at them for not coming because they have something else going on that is more important to them. i guess it kinda makes me feel degraded but i know i shouldn't because it's really no one's fault and they would come if they could. i think the weather is effecting my mood.
when it's rainy and crappy out i sit and think too much about life and how much i'm not in control. i let others tell me what to do too much. i have my beliefs and opinions yet i let other people tell me theirs and i don't tell them mine even though i know that their statement was more of a challenge on my opinion than a brush off. but maybe i should just stop thinking and leave it alone. besides rosalind's coming home and i can talk to her about it and feel better. i haven't talked to her in awhile. i usually talk to her on msn but i haven't been on there for months so oh well. i think this is a long enough entry for those who actually read it."

so this week sucks i just realized today that my week was planned out for me and there is nothing i can do about it. i have track tonight and then take dorothy to girl scouts and then rush back to wesley for piano lessons, tomorrow i have a track meet in forest city, wednesday i have a music concert but at least it's only in algona, thursday another track meet (i dont know where), friday lg group contest at BV, saturday sam and katielyn's grad parties then rush back to wesley for graduation mass and then run out to hillside because aunt donna says i can't take another saturday off (it was that bad) then on sunday i work at townmart because cec thinks i'm going to quit so she gives me more hours. monday i have another track meet...and that's as far as i can remember at the moment but there's more oh so much more...
i'm sorry rosalind but i can't come with mom to come and get u anymore because i have to work and donna probably won't let me off because the other waitresses suck. not to be mean or anything but it's the truth. i hope to see u soon at my grad party hint hint and i hope u survived izzy

i like johnny depp, i have a johnny depp keychain (thank you austin) and it's really awesome and it's on my bookbag and yeah. renee just walked into the computer lab. she is reading her english book and getting ready to listen to music on the computer. she is in advanced bio at the moment and is very busy also...ha ha ha that's funny. 
i have been blankly staring at this computer screen for about 15 minutes without writing something i think that might be bad, but it's true. don't you hate it when you're day dreaming and you wake up and you can't fall back into the state of ""sleep""? so of course you start to stare at the object (computer screen) that you were before and it seems wrong. like that wasn't the object and it looks different. but you know that it was the object because you ""woke up"" staring at it. and then you start to forget what you were even thinking about in the day dream. for example i have no idea what i was thinking. hopefully nothing dirty...hee hee hee. just laugh
i'm really tired and i have to work at hillside tonight. i had to work on wednesday too because i got home from track to receive a messege that my aunt needed me to work. it wasn't a big deal it's just that wednesday HAD been my only free day this week and i have so much stuff to get done at home. and i spent it at hillside with old ladies (it was ladies night) who don't tip well. oh well

so i looked at my schedule and i'm busy for like the next 3 week ends talk about crap. but i have to help out my aunt and uncle and work for them so that's 2 jobs trying both to get me on the weekends. because i get more hours on the weekend at townmart and cec hates staying until after schools out. i don't blame her i like to close a few minutes early too. no offence to the world but sitting with ur back to the wall with ur feet on the counter (shhhh shouldn't do that) staring at cigs or reading a book isn't what i consider the funnest thing to do on the weekend. but i guess running around and giving people food when ur hungry yourself isn't that much fun either. but then u get doug to make u a cheesy hash at the end of the night with green peppers and shrooms...yummmmmm. 
i'm hungry. but i shouldn't eat until after practice hummmmm...and i need to work on my marriage project and graduation announcements... oh i don't want to oh well. 
i really have nothing to write about sorry people this isn't very interesting to read but i don't think any of my journals are that interesting. soooo oh well and u probably don't read this anyway so why should i care? i could write something like ^%&*$#@ is a witch and no one would know but that's ok
oh i chose a college- i'm going to st mary's i'm sorry to all those people who wanted me to go to morningside but i think st mary's is the right place for me to go and u can all still see me when i come home i'll only be 2.5 hours away"

You don't really try to seduce people... it just seems to happen.
Fun loving and free spirited, you bring out the inner child in people.
You are spontaneous, sincere, and unpretentious - a hard combo to find!
People drop their guard around you, and find themselves falling fast.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","ok so let's start with the most recent events...
so i'm on my way home and then my cars curse shuts itself off and i'm like WTF?! ok so it's done this before no problem i'll push on the gas and turn it back on...WRONG! before i can even touch the pedal my car goes chunk chunk and DIES...dead stop in the middle of 18 so i'm like holy shish so i push on the brake and put it in park then i turn the key off and try to start it again...nothing ...so i try for about 1-2 minutes more while all the time being flicked off sworn at and honked at. ok people obviously i stopped my car in the middle of the freaking road just to piss u off so if u can come and start my car or shut the heck up! so after my great attempts someone finaly pulls over and is like do u need help? i could have screamed...but it's all good he helped me push it to the side of the road and then he looks at me funny and says-don't u have a phone? i'm like ummmm... no so he lets me use his. i really need to get a phone. so i started to call dad and then i'm like wtf he's out doing chores. so i call uncle dennis hoping he's getting off of work soon. no such luck he's getting off in an hour soooooooo i tell him what happened and he said he'd talk to dad and they'd try to fix it. so i then try to call grandma and grandpa to get a ride to work. no one home. i tried to call people in algona (people u didn't answer ur phones) so then i decided that even though i really didn't want to call them...i called my uncle darrel and chris ended up coming and getting me. oh happy days...NOT. then i called cec and i'm like hey my car died i'm going to be late. so yeah i get chris to go to my house on his way home and tell dad that the car is dead so he calls me at townmart and is like what? so i tell him and he comes and gets the keys. fustrated already yes i am. 
so tonight when dad came and got me from work me mainly said the car might not make it out alive. one too many attempts at suicide. so i'm like freaking A i really really really need a car tomorrow for work and my errands but hell no my parents think that i should be able to bug rides off of people and get rides to work...ok so this isn't going to work because mom doesn't get off work in time and dad has to do chores HELLO PEOPLE! blah
so add that to the horrible track meet last night(yes thank u alhers all he can say is what the heck happened...ouch!) and the fact that mom just yelled at me mainly telling me it was my fault the car killed itself and that i of course never help out with cleaning the house ever because i'm suck a lazy pile. 
so now besides shaken, depressed and feeling completely worthless, i'm fustrated. bad things coome in 3's so what happens next? i can' wait to find out...
oh and if anyone is still reading this (which i doubt) thanks austin and pat guy and i guess grant (even though u only came to watch katelyn run and didn't give to hoots about me) for coming and watching the boring track meet don't worry u don't have to come on friday. it's all good. my lifes a hell right now and i have to pick a college by friday WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","so i'm sitting here in the school computer lab all alone because i have track tonight and i wish it would rain so we could run in the rain. i love running in the rain. tomorrow we have a track meet at algona and i don't know what i'm going to be running. more than likely the 2 mile because i suck and can't do anything else. but that's ok. my mommy can't come because she has some meeting thing that i can't remember and then she has to pick up Dorothy from a birthday party. (i haven't been to one of those in awhile) so i shall have no one to watch me, because my dad won't be able to come becasue of chores (dumb pigs). 
so this weekend i spent saturday with my dad outside and we had to pull plum trees out of our fense line (one word or 2?) so to hide our identity (or to stop flying dirt from getting into our eyes) we wore our sunglasses, but as soon as we got out there someone (i didn't see who) drives by in a truck and yells out the window ""Hey Sam!"" and i was like curses, discovered. so when we came home for lunch dad told me i had to wear a hat on backwards also to hide my identity because it must have been my hair that gave us away. so i did and then it kept blowing away so i ended up wearing it the right way and people could still see a little bit of my hair but no one said hi. so i think we were safe. believe me it was a very dangerous mission. hee hee hee
 on sunday my aunt came up to me after church (for those of u who don't know what that is, it's something that u SHOULD be going to weekly hint hint) and she was like do u want ur job back? (oh for all of those i haven't told i used to work at hillside the golfcourse/restaurnt in wesley then i quit and the place closed down. now my aunt and uncle have boughten it) and i was like sure what the heck. so now i am a waitress at hillside again. and the down side is i can never complain about my bosses again. tear. muahahaha ha (evil laugh)oh well don't worry people i'm not quitting townmart though to work there i know cec is really really really worried about that (she's my boss at townmart but she's the manager) school's out now bell rang the end..."

"event","so i haven't written in awhile so i have some great stories to write about... even though that's about all i write about...
anyway so on saturday i get home from work and i'm like-wow i'm really tired i should reset my clock/alarm and go to bed. and then i'll reset the other clocks in the morning. so i actually did and i went to bed. (no that wasn't the highlite of the story) so i get up at 5:30 to do chores and i'm like crap. this sucks. but oh well. so i'm waiting for dad in the dining room and i'm like wow it's taking him a long time. so i decide to change the time on the clock in the kitchen. but when i look at it, it says 3:30 not 4:30 and i'm like wtf? so i look at the other clocks and they say the same so i go into my room and check my clock that is set by the radio. it says 4:30 and i'm still like wtf?! and then i look at my alarm and remember that it has a built in calender and it changes itself on dst so instead of one hour ahead i was up 2 hours ahead.... then i changed my alarm back to where it was suppose to be and went back to bed. the end
so another good story:
i got in from chores this morning and got ready for school like usual and as i'm walking out the door i'm like drat i hate school clothes i wish today was a jeans day. i stopped. turned around. and walked back into the house. (fyi-today is a jeans day for seniors...)
there they are both stories rate them as u will but not for stupid reasons and they have to make sense.
the end"

"event","hummmm...i should be in bed right now but i don't want to go to bed. i should because i'm tired and i have to wake up tomorrow and do the same fun things that i got to do today. yeah...sounds like a blast i know. 
lets see do i have any great stories to tell...no i don't think so that's sad.
oh well i'll get over it. i think and if i don't well then people bring cookies to my funeral. and if u don't i shall haunt u for eternity or until i get sick of it. but that might be awhile so beware. dun dun dunnnnnn
(evil music in the backround with the evil laugh) 
let's see what can i write that u people will read and then not really understand what u have just read. therefore confusing the world. (more evil laugh) well since i don't have anything else to write about...
i'm sitting at my computer. well ok, it's not my computer, but my parents' but that point is besides the point. anyway and i'm sitting in my pj's with a blue tank top and strawberry shortcake pants (which reminds me austin still owes me a piece of cake and grant owes me popcorn and pop...hint hint)anyway on with the story...my hair is also wet because i took a shower at a quarter to 10 because i didn't get home till 9:30 and i'm cool like that. ha ha ha just laugh. anyway i just got done listening to ""Loser"" by 3 Doors Down, a very good band. and now i'm listening to ""In the End"" but Linkin Park and they're a very good band. also...
humm i think i have bored the world of people who actually read my live journal long enough sooooo good night people!"

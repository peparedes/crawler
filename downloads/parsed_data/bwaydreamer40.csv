my mom said shes gettin married to this asshole next weekend. 

-He got transferred to gainsville to work there but now he got transferd back to miami because ""we were thing of u"". we want to 'make you happy' so you could finish your last year at braddock. if not we would have had to move to gainsville.

STFU

so we dnt have money for a wedding but their gettin married ""as soon as possible"" by law so that she can have him move in.

-hes spending too much money stayin in a hotel right now so were trying to do things ""as best as we can""

send the fucker back

lets put aside that i hate and dislike this man completely. So does my cat and the rest of my family. I DONT TRUST HIM. when he had the key to my place a whole mess of expensive stff went disappering. prob to go for his alcohol addiction fund. weve had not one but TWO restraining orders on him. AND the court forced him into rehab WHICH he never finished. Hmmm....

so i told the biatch im movin out the day he moves in

crazy i kno

"event","Woke up early this morning, made my coffee like I always do.
Then it hit me from nowhere, everything I feel about me and you.
The way you kiss me crazy, baby you're so amazing.

Seven days and seven nights of thunder,
The waters rising and I'm slipping under.
I think I fell in love with the 8th world wonder.

I guess that I'm just falling deeper into something I've never known.
But the way that I'm feeling, makes me realize that it can't be wrong.
You're love's like a summer rain, washing my doubts away.

Seven days and seven nights of thunder,
The waters rising and I'm slipping under.
I think I fell in love with the 8th world wonder.

It's only been a week, but it's coming over me.
It's making me believe that you're the one for me.

You savvy?
the movie is amazing so go see it. if u havnt seen the first one, or if u havnt seen it in a really long time i recommend u do cuz if not ull be lost. this is the best pirate movie ive seen with awesome twists, some PG sexy scenes lol, and witty humor. Its a long two and half hour adventure but dammit it was worth it.

My ALLTIME FAVORITE lines in the entire film:
""There will come a moment when ull have the chance to do the right thing."" -Elizabeth
""i love those moments...I like to wave at them as they pass by""-jack sparrow

LMFAO!!!"

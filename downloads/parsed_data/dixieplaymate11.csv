"event","oo man im soo bored..its 2 in the morning and i cant sleep cause i took a nap today so thought i put sum cool lyrics in here

Take it back, take it all back now 
The things I gave 
Like the taste of my kiss on your lips 
I miss that now 

I can't try any harder than I do 
All the reasons I gave, excuses I made for you 
I'm broken in two 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
Yeah I need you 
Don't walk away 

Touch me now, how I wanna feel something so real 
Please remind me, my love 
And take me back 
Cause I'm so in love with what we were 
I'm not breathing, I'm suffocating without you 
Until you feel it too 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you 
Yeah I need you 

When I'm in the dark and all alone 
Dreamin' that you'll walk right through my door 
It's then I know my heart is whole 
There's a million reasons why I cry 
Hold my covers tight and close my eyes 
Cause I don't wanna be alone 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you 
I need you 

Cause I can't fake 
And I can't hate 
But it's my heart that's about to break 
You're all I need 
I'm on my knees 
Watch me bleed 
Would you listen please 

I give in 
I breathe out 
I want you 
There's no doubt 

I freak out 
I'm left out 
Without you 
I'm without 

I'm crossed out 
I'm kicked out 
I cry out 
I reach out 

Don't walk away 


well..have a nice day!"

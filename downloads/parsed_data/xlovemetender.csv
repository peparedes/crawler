Eric proposed Friday evening. We went for a quick walk before band practice and I went off the path to try and get a better view of this waterfall. And when I turned around, he was down on one knee with a ring. Right behind me. It was beautiful. Perfect really.
I'm so happy and excited! I only wish we had the means to have the wedding like, next week! haha
I've already registered at about 4 places. And I'll probably do more. I'll have to eliminate some. 
I'm trying hard to lose weight. I'm actually working out and cutting back on a lot of the junk I was eating. And I can't seem to get enough water. Unfortunately though, I'm a pretty bloated. :/ But that will pass. I just wish I could fit into my church clothes.
BUT.....I'M ENGAGED TO MY BEST FRIEND!! Eeee! ;D

Sad news-our(my family's) cat died. He was hit by a car on the main road. Eric spotted him. My sister is beside herself. He was her baby.
I just finished up another round of sobbing. I was looking at his baby pictures and...yeah. We miss him terribly. It's just not the same without him. He was THE coolest cat. He literally changed lives.
We made a nice grave. I just hate that we're moving soon and we can't take him with us. He was a member of the family. It's like having to bury your brother somewhere where you'll never be able to go again.

It sucks.
I've gotten used to the feeling of an empty stomach.
But that's ok-I think I may have actually lost a couple of pounds.
So, it's a good thing.
But having Aislin here...that's more difficult.
I always find something for her. But she'd rather have junk food. 
She is a kid.
So she throws a lot of fits.


I have such a headache.
And cramps.
I can't wait to get all of this ""fixed"".
I'm sick of this.

My sister was in the hospital 2 nights ago.
She's had this pain in her side for a year or 2 now and she suddenly got a fever of 104. Turns out she has an abdominal infection and cervicits(from the infection). But she's doing better. They pumped her full of antibiotics.

 
My head is killing me.
I'm done with this."

Yeah, I'm a little depressed right now.
Oh I did get a fucking bill for $202 from that damn coffee shop. My dad said he'd help me pay it. I really hope he keeps his word on that.

Eric's taking me out tomorrow. I know we're going to an italian restaraunt and I think he's getting me the Skynyrd shirt I want-<i>yes</i>!

But I really hate that I have no friends to celebrate with. Hell, the last few years-what a bitch. I had to call everyone, give directions, plan everything...and some of the people that showed up I barely knew. And some I was very out of touch with(no, that was not MY fault).

Man...I don't think I realized just how sorry my life is until now.
At least I have my wonderful fiance. Eric is the best. I cannot wait to marry him. And to spend the rest of my life with him. He's my best friend. There's noone else. He was made for me and I for him.

Well, I'm gonna finish my food and maybe have a drink or two."

"event","One of the kittens had to be put to sleep.:*(
He came out and he was breathing weird.
So, when he didn't get better after a few minutes, I took him to the vet.
They thought the same thing I did-that there was fluid he couldn't get up.
Simple enough-just pump it out.
Well, when they went to put the pump in his mouth, they found the problem.
He had a cleft pallete.
So, even if he did nurse, none of it would go to his stomach and he would starve to death.
I cried like a baby.
In that short time I grew attatched to him.
He was beautiful.
He was gray, had long hair and a mohawk! 
I wanted him. I really, really wanted him.
It seems like every kitten she has that I want, dies.
They were really sweet at the vets.
The doctor was very genuine.
You don't see that a whole lot.
I told her I didn't have any money and I broke down thinking about how that poor thing would have to suffer because of it. But she said, ""No no no-don't worry about it!"" 
Wow.

The other kittens are perfect.
5 left.
2 black ones, an orange one, a beige one and a white one.
The beige and white ones surprised us.
Eric decided we're taking 2 instead of just one.
The orange one and the white one.
I'm almost positive the orange one is a girl and the white one a boy.
The orange one is the smallest one. So cute!
If it is a boy and girl, their names are going to be Rosco and Daisy.
And then in a couple of years we want to get an english bulldog and name him Diesel and get another dog(female) and name her Dixie.

I'm really sad about that little one.
Thankfully Ron was in a good mood most of the night(at work)- so, I didn't stay upset all night.

Eric and I are going camping for 4 days.
I'm up doing laundry. He's asleep.

I'm slightly annoyed because I am so tired and I had just gotten comfortable when she started crying.
But I'm also excited.
She's going nuts trying to find a place to have them.
My mom and I tried to get her to chill out next to the couch on some towels, but she wasn't having that.
She kept trying to get INTO the couch, in my mom's room, behind the couch...*sigh*
Once she starts to push, I'll make sure she's next to me(by the couch).

Right now her contractions are still pretty spaced out. So, she'll probably have them somewhere between 7 and 9. Well, have the first one somewhere in there. Ya know there can be up to an hour between kittens? Oi. I hope that's not the case. It wasn't last time.

Oh and I'm listening to country music.
Yes, it's ok for you to laugh at me.

My Aisybug is in town.
We played outside for a little while today. Played cards and Trouble.
Yesterday I made her a fort(with a sheet) and she slept in there so Eric could sleep on the couch.
Tomorrow we may make a HUGE fort while everyones at work.
And play outside some more.
We were going to go fishing and to the park with Eric's neice and nephews Friday as a late birthday thing for her. But it's going to be in the low 50's. Damnit. Now I have no idea what we're going to do. I'm so broke. Ugh.
Yeah it's been in the 80's for a while now. I thought we'd be able to do that for sure.

Life is looking up.
Eric is a blessing.
Our relationship is a blessing.
I fall more and more in love with him.

We're both starting new jobs soon.
Money will be less of a problem. But he's going to be my boss. Good thing he'll be in the office and I'll be driving all day-or we might really get annoyed with eachother.

We're hoping to buy a house-rather than rent.
But I must get a car first.
Thought Brandon's(his guitarist) stepdad would be more sympathetic and give us a good deal on one of his cars. But he wants way too much. Like he needs money-he's freaking loaded. But Brandon said he'd try and talk him down. Especially since I need it SO bad and the car needs a little work.
Pray that I get a car soon. A reliable car. 
Without a car, I can't move forward.
My job is all the way in Gainesville-like 30-45 minutes away.

I wish Eric would let me have guys as my ""bridesmaids""(I guess I could say brides people). Because honestly, the only people I want standing behind me on that day are Luke, Anthony and my sister. But they'd probably think it was a dumb idea anyway. I have no close girl friends. Maybe I'll make some before we get married and I can shove them in matching taffeta gowns. Haha not really. Taffeta...eww.
But yeah, Luke and Anthony have been the best friends. Everyone else flakes on me. Or they get aggrivated that I am a parent and can't always hang out so they just stop calling me all together. Bastards. Yeah-that fucking hurts.

Anywho...
Tomorrow Eric and I are spending almost all day fishing. We went out yesterday and found a new spot-caught 2 small mouth bass. 
It's a beautiful spot. Sand, river, bridge, trees, rocks...

My whole body hurts. And only one thing makes the pain go away. But I'm sick of that.

Ais got sick a couple of days before her birthday, so, she stayed in Statesboro and we were going to go see her, but we didn't have the money for gas. Bryan gave her a little party. And Eric and I are going to throw her something when she gets here for spring break. She and Eric's nephews and niece can play. 
Oh-Eric's 4 year old nephew said he's going to marry me when he grows up. How cuuuuute! hahaha

A lot of things suck right now. But Eric and I are wonderful! I love him so much. He's the best friend I've ever had.

When you're really sick (and it shows!) and your signifigant other can look at you and tell you you're beautiful...and mean it...and say it without you coaxing them or fishing for it...you know they love you.

I've been looking into taking some baking classes.
Georgia sucks.
There are no diploma programs to be a pastry chef anywhere.
So, I'll get my certificate and that should get me an entry level position somewhere.
I'd like to work in a nice restaurant. Work my way to head pastry chef. 
I would love to work somewhere like <a href=""http://www.charmcitycakes.com/"">Charm City Cakes</a>. That would be the best. They only make cakes. It's not some bakery where you can just walk in and get a pastry or something.

As incredible as going to Paris to learn how to make truffles and pastries would be, I could never leave Eric. He means more to me than Paris.

About a few things.
One being that I have virtually no friends anymore.
And I'm going to tell all of them just how I feel.
Tell them how they've treated me and just let it out finally.
Hell, it's not like I have anything to lose.

Tori is pretty much the only friend I have left and we really only see eachother at work. Hopefully we can actually hang out sometime soon. It's tough too b/c she's dealing with some stuff and she's got a new guy and works two jobs and I have a boyfriend and work and have no car. But I really hope we can start hanging out regularly and can get closer. 

Another thing is that Eric doesn't seem to want to meet any of my friends(as stated before, not very many of them anyways). And I really want him to meet Tori. They've seen eachother a couple of times, but that's it. I want to be able to hang out with her and him. And her boy. Like, do couple things together maybe. I love him and I'm proud of him. And it never seems fully official when your boy hasn't met your friends.

**SSIIIIGGGHHH**

My hip has been killing me today. I cannot wait until I can go to the chiro again.

Late New Years resolutions:
-Stop letting things that are in the past(mine or his) affect me so much. Let it go, Carla.
-Stop thinking that just because you don't have the perfect body that it makes or breaks anything. He loves me. Period.
-Stop getting into petty arguments. It's not worth it.
-Save some damn money.
-Get a car.
-Get my own place(or <b>our</b> own place).
-Call college and figure out what needs to be done so that I'm eligable to go next year.
-Love every single day that the good Lord has given me.

There are many more things I could write about, but really, what's the point? Noone read this shit anymore. LJ is just about dead. Not really much point in this entry at all.

But she really doesn't seem to mind if she doesn't get a lot. She is so incredibly mature. Even more than some 20-somethings I know/have known. 
Sometimes we'll go to the store and she'll want something and I have to tell her no, that I don't have enough money for it. And she's not like those annoying, spoiled kids who throws themselves to the ground, screaming until mommy or daddy gives in. She just shrugs and says, ""That's ok. We can get it another time."" What <b><font size=""3"">5</b></font> year old do you know who would say that?
I cannot believe I have thus far raised such an amazing human being. She's going to be a brilliant, wonerful, loving individual all her life. And I just hope I can be there to see all of the amazing things she is going to do. And I pray she get's the opportunity to do those amazing things. God really blessed me by giving me the honor of birthing and raising her.
I want her back. I really do. But sleeping on a couch, living in a house where lots of weed is smoked, is not the life or the enviorment I want her in. 
I'm getting more hours at work and I'm confident that I will be kept on after the holidays. I will work my butt off to get a place for us and to make it a home. 
I miss her so much.
And it makes me regret every spanking and every time I've ever yelled. There really is no reason to yell. I don't want her to be the type of person who screams in an argument. I want her to be the type of person who can keep their cool and speak at a normal volume when in one of those situations. That always seems to work better. And it can really irritate the other person. haha
One of the things I hate about her living with Bryan is the fact that he is not a Christian and I vowed to raise her in the way God sees fit. To speak to her regularly about the Lord. And to pray with her. 
Every Christmas and every Easter, I tell her what those holidays are really about. And she remembers a little more each year. And she has said how much she loves Jesus which makes my heart swell and brings a tear to my eye.
I love my little girl. Being a parent...you'd never know you could love so much. And it allows you to see how much God loves you.

In other news, Eric and I are going to the mountains Friday night. And we'll be back Sunday night. I'm so excited. We're going to cook together, hot tub and just be together. And I'll get to sleep in an actual bed. <i>Yessss!</i> I can't tell you how crappy it is sleeping on a couch with a hip out of place. And not being petite...ugh. I wake up several times to turn. It's terrible. Sleeping with him though, I sleep like a rock. It's going to be a good weekend."

Woke up and went to get ready for Turkey Day.
His family is so different from mine. 
And Bryan's family is definitly different than both of our families. Eric didn't know what to make of it. So we, only stayed for about 30 minutes so that Ais could see her Papa(grandpa).

Eric took Ais and I to the Christmas tree lighting downtown Lawrenceville. We got hot chocolate and hot apple cider and listened to Christmas music, saw the tree get lit and saw Santa ride through town in a horse-drawn carriage. It was really nice.

We talked more about the wedding and added an after party-just for friends and us.
No, we're not engaged or getting married anytime soon, we just know that we are going to one day. This is it. We were made for one another.
He's amazing. And he's so wonderful with Ais.
He still gives me butterflies. When he kisses me, I melt. I actually went so weak once, I dropped a cigarette in his lap. haha
It took 3 years of praying-God finally put us together. I couldn't be happier.

Anyways, I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving!
All day I thought about how thankful I am for my Lord and Savior, for my best friend whom I want to spend the rest of my life with, my little girl, my family, a roof over my head...

WTF?!??

My throat has swollen again.
I took an antibiotic and 30 minutes later, my palms were itching like mad! A few minutes later, the bottoms of my feet. And then it spread slightly to my calves, tops of my hands and feet, my forearms, my armpits, my face. But after about an hour it stopped. 
I need to take more antibiotics, but I'm afraid I'll start itching again. But that antibiotic has never done that before.

My whole body hurts. 
I just want to sleep.

I had to get sick while Ais is in town.

I miss Eric.

And where the hell is my paycheck?!
4 weeks and I have yet to see 1 red cent.
Mom:""I wouldn't even consider working anymore until I saw that paycheck!""

I need more hours at F.Y.E.
For real."

Just being young and in love.

I really want an outdoor wedding. In the mountains. In the fall. With the beautiful orange, red, and yellow collage as our backdrop. Vowing our love and commitment to one another with God's glory all around us. 
He'd be willing to do that, because he loves me. But because I love him, I'd be willing to have a church wedding-he's always wanted a church wedding. 

I'm exhausted. Almost fell asleep during church tonight.:/

I cannot wait until we can go to OUR bedroom and climb into OUR bed and fall asleep in one another's arms. Or at leaset close to one another. Because let's face it, that's not always the most comfortable position to be in for lengthy periods. I sleep so well when he's next to me. *sigh*:)

Ok. I'll stop being sappy.

Believe me, I intended to.
But he got to me like noone ever has.
We've talked about a wedding. A lot actually. I know, we're crazy. 
Don't worry it's not like we're gonna go elope tomorrow. We're trying to wait at least a year. haha
Man... I love him so much. More than I thought it was possible to love someone. He does so much for me. Like this morning, he drove all the way here to bring me black pants(today's my first day of work at FYE-Sam Goody-and I need black pants and have none). And he had to be at work at 10. 
He searches online for hours for the perfect songs to put on a mix cd for me. He loves every part of me. He does everything and anything he possibly can for me. I know I make him happy-he tells me often. But I want to do more. Always. 
 
When we went to the mountains we stopped at this fruit stand and got boiled peanuts and hot apple cider. I said, ""We should do this when we get old."" He thought it was a great idea. Even told his mom. ""Oh nice...you're going to be a peddler."" haha
We were thinking of getting a place up there(once we're married-if that happens...). We love it there. It's so beautiful. Even if we lived in a trailer on the side of the river. We'd be happy. 

So, I appreciate everyones concern-I really, really do.  But this one's different.:)"

Eric picked me up.

We picked up lunch for the boys(his nephews) and us and went to the house and ate with them and his mom.

Drove up to the mountains and saw the most beauitful sights ever. The trees on the mountins looked like a patchwork quilt. Stunning!

We sat on a rock in the middle of the river eating brownies.

Went to Anna Ruby falls. I about died walking up there. Being out of shape+smoking a lot = Carla almost dying! Yeah...

We hung out with a few of his friends in Daholonega.

Went to his work and I finally got to meet Perry.

Went to the gas station and saw a kid dancing in the parking lot. I mean he was going at it! Serious face and all. We looked at eachother and busted out laughing.

Went back to his house, ate good food, ordered a movie, he fell asleep with his arm around me(^-^) and then he drove me home. 

When he kisses me I get lightheaded. When he holds me I feel like I'm home. And the fact that I can dance in his car...*ahem*like I did...wow. I'm just so comfotable with him. He's the most amazing guy. I've been blessed so very much. He makes everything better. And I want to do as much as I possibly can to make him happy. 

This is by far the best relationship I have ever been in.

My sister didn't like her room being messy when her friend came home with her; well, even though she had done the vast majority of the mess, I got hell for it. From her AND my mom. Aislin is so defiant lately. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. He's supposed to come over, but I haven't heard from him yet and when I tried to call it went straight to voicemail. I almost slipped and said that three letter phrase when he last called.

People kept coming in from the oldies concert in the square for coffee and hot chocolate.
We made out pretty well.
My dad left me to go to this place called the barn for praise and worship. And of course, I kept getting slammed.  But I went at a decent pace and noone got aggrivated or anything.

I went to church for the first time in a long time. Well, actually I went a few weeks ago, but I didn't dig it there. This place was different. The music wasn't very good-its a church that usually doesnt allow music, but Pastor Doyle changed that for his. But people were cheering and I suddenly began to cry. I almost sobbed. I was completely overwhelmed. The Lord touched me today and it was simply amazing. I will be going back. And I will be continue to pursue Him and to stop being so afraid of what people think about me, about how I look or sound when I'm praising Him. Because it's not about me. Not at all.

I've read almost everyones entries since I lost my connection to the net on my comp. Just not up to posting comments. But I love you.

So, as of right now, it's been at least 15 hours since I last ate. I told God I gave Him the rest of the day. That was the only thing that kept me from snacking with my dad at 10:00 at night. There was no way I was going to break that promise to Him. 

I think I'll be ok.

I feel bad because my dad has been at the shop for about an hour and I'm still here. But I'm only here because I'm waiting for my clothes to dry. He washed clothes last night, put them in the dryer and then turned it off later because he didn't want to hear the dryer while he was trying to sleep. But that set me back since my clothes were in the washer. Blah.

I found my old glasses. The semi cat-eyed ones. I broke one of the ear pieces off(which is why I got the newer pair). So, I just glued it back on. Hopefully it will stay. It's been about 3 months since I lost my (newer)glasses-maybe longer-and my contacts really need to go. I've been wearing them since October.

"event","Had a couple of miserable days. I just seem depressed all the time now. At least the teachers at school make me laugh and all that. The teachers are actually more my friends than the students. So I just talk to them all day. Everyone else is a stranger to me now..   Not much longer of school though.


I don't feel like updating anymore."

"event","Today I went with my grandma (I had to drive since she's not allowed, because she's getting radiation treatments) to cash some checks I had. I'm in this work readiness program at school that I get paid for. We also went to the post office, and I got a haircut so that was some more driving practice for me. 

I have to do something about this weight issue."

Today we planted flowers at my mom's grave.

I wanted to see House of Wax this weekend but I didn't. 

Really bored right now. My family is at my aunt's, I didn't want to go. Haven't felt like doing anything lately. If I had my license I'd just go out for a drive.  I need to go find something to do."

"event","Another usual day at school. One of my teachers said I might've not been marked absent yesterday, so maybe I'm saved.

July 15th will make 6 months, and that's when I take my road test for my license. My dad bought me a car months ago (1993 Chevrolet Cavalier) but it needs to be fixed. He's going to be finally putting it on the road soon. Can't wait until I get the license though, it's pain to have to drive with someone all the time.

Sometimes I hate nights because that's when the day is over, everyone is resting and there's nothing to do. I used to go for walks at night but that got boring. It'd be better if there was someone with me. I'd go for one now, but ehh it's almost 10...oh well."

"event","I decided I didn't like my username of my new livejournal so I made another. Here's the entry I typed last night for it:


-----------------------
I gave up the Xanga and came back to Livejournal.

I'm in one of those ""tired of everything"" moods. I feel this way every once in a while. Here are some contributing factors:

-My mom passed away March 11.
-Overweight.
-No friends or social life.

The only thing that seems to make me happy is the piano that I just got. My dad bought it for me from his friend. I checkout out its serial number online and according to a site, it was manfactured in 1924 and it has ivory keys. It had to be put out in the garage but it's great. But back to the misery...

For those of you who don't know, my mom had pancreatic cancer for about a year. I don't feel like talking about it.

I've always been overweight, and there have been many attempts to fix that. Some attempts worked, but I usually gave up on them. Now I don't even do anything about it, I'm too lazy. But I know it's the main reason I don't feel good about myself. I'm the kind of person who wants to be thin now, no work. All that exercise, and eating right, working for it as a goal...I can't seem to do it. Now if I had to shed just a few pounds, maybe 10 or 20, that would be easy. But being VERY overweight makes you think of all the hard work you'll have to go through to lose the pounds. With my height I believe I should be around 170 lbs. Last time I checked I was a little over 240. Yes, not exactly self-esteem raising. Everyday I have to look at fit, thin, healthy people that don't have to worry about how they look or anything. I really hate it. As an added bonus I don't like the way I look either sometimes. I think being overweight makes you uglier.

All through my years of school I had a lot of friends. During middle and some of high school, I was even ""popular"" to an extent. But then I had to have some ""problems"" with anxiety and stress. So they ship me off to an alternative school in Cherry Hill called Brookfrield Academy. So I spent 11th grade there. I decide to go back to Hammonton High School for 12th grade. When I transfer back they don't want to put me in a regular schedule with regular classes (now that I think about it I never would have made it in reg. classes anyway). They put me in a program called PRIDE, in a self contained classroom where I stay all day. But yeah, I was expecting everyone to be like OMG BRIAN'S BACK HEYYY when I returned. Nah. Not exactly the kind of reaction I got. I was like a new student. (I hate explaining these things in this journal, I just get all pissed off because I'm reminded of my problems and I have to think about them). Let's just sum it up... I'm lonely, pretty much depressed all the time inside, even when I'm in a good mood and laughing. I wish I had some nice clothes for school, dammit. I wear the same outfits all the time, and usually a black sweatshirt. Makes me feel comfortable I guess.. I don't take it off in school when I wear it. I just can't wait until school is over. I've already missed so many days where I can't miss anymore. 

Unfortunately, being overweight kills me, in the sense like I don't want to do anything or won't be truly happy until I'm thin. Like I said I'm lonely, and I'm dying for some friends, someone to talk to. But I don't want to work at getting friends (I don't know how I would anyway) because I don't feel good about myself. I don't want to work at getting thin anymore because diets suck and yes you could say I'm lazy, and the depression helps. Sometimes I just get that ""I hate life"" feeling, like I'm a nobody, a loser. Actually I'm feeling it now.

Every day the same. Wake up, go to school, come home, be bored and do the same things I like to do. I could keep going on about my problems, but I think I'll stop...
-----------------

Yeah.. and I was still feeling depressed this morning so I didn't go to school. I don't know what's going to happen now. Nothing interesting happened today, just stayed in."

Summer was fun, saw Octopus Project again and went to Lollapalooza. I&nbsp;had a fun bout with heat sickness after camping for Dan Deacon on Sunday, but it was one of the best concert experiences I've had in a long time. 

1st semester back as a sophomore was amazing. I've been loving this year more than any other. I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about not having CORE classes, but I&nbsp;fell in love with my major all over again. I&nbsp;found a better work ethic, got a job as a monitor, and produced some of my best work to date. In a slight jaunt forward, some of my work for my Studio lighting class this semester was selected for the Student Photo show. I'm seriously excited for that now. I&nbsp;managed to score straight A/A- across the board, and made President's list. I&nbsp;don't think&nbsp;I've ever done this well in school in the past. It's only re-affirming my love for this school. I've never been in a better place in my life. I have the work that I'm passionate about, I have wonderful friends and I&nbsp;have Nicole, who continues to be a huge part of my life. 

Winter break went by quickly, stuck around Ringling a few extra days, then came back to Florida early. I&nbsp;can't take Chicago winters anymore. I love my friends back at home, but I can't take the cold and the separation from Nicole for too long. Seeing Nicole again at SRQ&nbsp;the Wednesday before classes started was definitely the highlight of break.

This semester has been busy so far, but it's only getting better. Unfortunately, it started with the departure of one of my closest friends, Em. I'm gonna miss the hell out of her, but she's determined to make her return. She definitely deserves to be able to come back. In lighter news, at this point, I'm just finishing up the first projects in most of my classes. Location Lighting has been really beneficial so far, and I'm excited to move on to the new work in Alternative Processes. It's funny, just last year I was getting so excited for this class, and now it's actually here. Time moves quickly here. Perspective Drawing is a fun way to start my mornings, and at least I&nbsp;have one good friend in the class out of the 7 people who are enrolled :P. I can see why people might not wanna take this class at 8:30, but I&nbsp;was too anxious to see Kaplan again. He's been one of the most supportive teachers I've ever had. In theory I'm now a part of three different bands, one of which I actually got to perform with twice now. It's a great feeling to get back on stage again, even if it is for the most ridiculous reason. We call ourselves Midi Steamboat, and it's been one of the most fun things I've done involving music. We even got a small following of some of our friends. It's a crazy feeling. 

Now, back to recent news. This whole past weekend has been crazy. Friday was the usual array of DDR and Rock Band. I went a bit early for DDR and wore myself out entirely. I have a few new friends who play DDR now, and it's nice to actually feel challenged every once in a while. :P. Oh, not to mention I had some very wonderful talks with one of my best friends at school. I&nbsp;ended up setting him up with a friend of mine for a friendly date for the semi-formal. And then we get to Saturday with the actual semi formal. I&nbsp;spent the early afternoon working on cyanotypes, then started to get ready for the semi-formal. Mind you, the dance was very high schoolish. Still, it was nice to kinda get that experience now that I never really got back then. Especially since it was with Nicole, I enjoyed it a bit more. But what really made the night great was seeing one of my best friends actually break out of his single funk and really get comfortable on any kind of date type thing. We ended up at 7-Eleven afterward since we forgot to eat dinner and then spent a few hours just hanging out and slightly discussing him :P. He seems really happy and definitely lovestruck. There was a picture posted on facebook of him in his first slowdance ever with her, and it's really adorable. I couldn't be happier for him. It reminded me of what I&nbsp;was like when I was still single and falling for Nicole. It's mostly just seeing him in a different light than I ever have in the past. I wish only the best for him at this point. He definitely deserves the best. 

If Nicole reminds me to, I'll update more often. Otherwise I'll probably forget because I have a shit ton of work to do this semester. 

Talk to y'all soon.

Last week of Ringling was crazy, but amazing. Ended up with A, A-, A-, B+, B+, B for my grades, and I'm happy to say two of those A's were from studio classes. But yeah, the last week went very well for the most part. I&nbsp;was stressed beyond belief trying to finish everything up. This whole art thing is really really tough. 

In any case, I left Ringling the same day I had my darkroom final presentation. That was a good time, actually. Darkroom was prolly one of the best critiques we've had as a class. Everyone had turned in something that really looked finished, and had a nice cohesive feel. It's nice to see what people come up with, what their thought process is. I was super happy with how my work turned out, and I'm more and more glad I made the switch to medium format entirely for the final. I couldn't have been happier with my work really. Still, I think what I ended up being most proud of was my work from spring break while I was back here. I think it helped to kinda get away from Chicago and the suburbs for a while so I could put my mind somewhere else, and then have a fresh view when I got back. However, I still have to wonder what the hell was going through my head when I decided to go to the beach while it was frozen over and glaciers were forming. Oh wait, that's exactly why I went :D. It also reminded me that landscapes and the like are what I really love about photography. The way my teacher described it was abstract landscapes. Honestly, what was nicest about the darkroom class was that everyone actually wanted to be there and work. It's a good feeling, and I'm glad that those who are actually really dedicated to their craft will be back next semester.

Back on subject, the day I moved out. That was...interesting. My mom and godmother got in the day before, and they had met a few of my friends, Nicole, etc. The 2nd day when they drove down, it was just moving a majority of my stuff to the storage unit, and packing the rest of my stuff in the car. My RA&nbsp;was gone when we were going to try to check out, so we just went to dinner first. We came back, and my RA&nbsp;was ready. He checked my completely empty side of the room, and then I&nbsp;handed over my three keys. Seriously, seeing my room that empty again was just the strangest feeling ever. I just couldn't imagine not being there. I&nbsp;mean, I can't wait to get into the upperclassmen housing. But freshman dorms have their charm. You get used to a certain way of life, y'know? Sure, my room looked more like a prison block than a room with our white cinder block walls and our linoleum flooring, and we had to share a bathroom and 3 showers with about 8 other guys, but it worked out. It also helped that I woke up earlier than everyone else.&nbsp;XP In any case, I had to say my goodbyes, and head off north to spend the night about 45 minutes off campus.

The two day drive back home wasn't so bad. At least the one hotel we stayed at had internet. First stop once we were home was Pita Inn XP. Since then, I spent a long period of time on a job hunt to avoid working for my mom. After 14 or so applications, only one interviewed me and technically hired me, although I have no hours as of now. I ended up taking the job with my mom (by which i mean I&nbsp;was forced to take it). The first day was rough. After that, the job went well. I'm still working there, and although I no longer have the long 8 hour day, it's still good pay. I don't know if I'll ever actually get hours with the conditional hire, but at least I have something for now. I might just write them off at this point. I'm happy with the flexibility of the job I have now, and I prolly should've just taken it in the first place. It's not that bad. 

Other than that, summer at home has been decent. I miss school, Florida, all the new friends I made down south. It's a great place to be, and I cherish every second I have there. I'll be leaving home again on August 19th, and starting school the 24th. It takes a few days to drive down, and I'll have a day in between move-in and classes thankfully. Next semester's schedule won't be nearly as strenuous as this past one (27 1/2 hour class week last semester, 19 1/4 this next semester). It'll be nice to have a LITTLE bit of a break. Then I get overloaded again 2nd semester (24 3/4 hours?) It's worth it though. I love this school more than I have any other, and I can't wait to see where the photo program takes me.

Whoops.

Umm...I'm going home in like...3 days. Which is really sad, cuz I'm gonna miss this place like crazy. Seriously, this summer is going to feel like the longest three months of my life. I'm excited to get home and get a break from work, but at the same time there's so much here that I'm going to miss (mainly Nicole).

In any case, this last week or so has been really really hectic. Busy working away at finishing up classes for the time being. Tomorrow I have a portfolio due and an extra credit presentation. Tuesday I have my final critique in photo (yikes). It's a lot of work, but it's all worth it. This is still only my first year here and already it's become more than beneficial. I'm excited to start next year. Although I'm really enjoying this variety that we have this year, I'm going to enjoy the focus on photography that comes next semester. 

So, so far I've already turned in all my work for sequential, turned in my work for Image and Color (I'm getting an A- :D) I'm pretty positive I'm also getting an A&nbsp;in Writing (turned in the portfolio already). I'm really not all that worried. So I should have 2 - 4 A's this semester, which is (hopefully) going to make my parents feel better about how much money they're dropping on this school :/ . Whatever, I think they understand why I want to be here, and I'm showing them that I'm actually putting forth the effort for how much this school costs. 

This past couple of weeks we've been seeing the final senior shows of the various departments (went to see the Photo Thesis show, the GIC senior show, the Illustration Senior show, and part of the CA thesis show. Might get to see the Fine Arts show, but don't know yet).It's been really fun, and really inspiring to see what happens after four years here. 

Admittedly it's a little frightening to see how many photo majors actually survive through til senior year, but I'm really not all that worried. This year alone, the freshman class cut down from 60ish to 30ish. That's a lot of people. And the senior class only had about 11 people. It's a lot to live up to, but at the same time Ringling doesn't entirely expect everyone to make it through to the end. What I've really started to notice is that not everyone who goes here necessarily feels the same way about the school. I really hope I don't end up having a change of heart here. I love this school dearly. It's been the best year of any schooling that I've had in my life. It's been an experience that I couldn't compare to any other. Even through the stressful weeks that have arisen at the end of this semester, I'm still really excited to finish up this semester and see how much my hard work has paid off. I've already seen a great change in my work as an artist, as a photographer, just overall. I'm so happy with how everything turned out. 

I think what I'm most proud of is how much I've really branched out as an artist. I think most of this is due to the fact that it is CORE&nbsp;year, so it gives us the biggest variety of work. However, mostly this semester I've found this in my Image and Color class. I've expressed this to my teacher even, but it's been my most enjoyable class this semester because it really gave me free reign to try whatever I wanted in art, and not only work in photography. I mean, the point of a foundation year is to explore, experiment, try new things. A lot of people in my class chose to stick with photography for their work, but I didn't want that. I still love photography, but when given the opportunity to break free from your comfort zone, why not? I took on oil pastel and went full force. I'm so happy with the work that I produced, and I can't imagine how different my body of work would've been if I didn't. Even when I was kinda in a time crunch and had to switch slightly to photography, I still kept things different (Took my photos and gesso transferred onto a canvas panel). That class taught me more about who I&nbsp;am as an artist than anything else has this semester.

To sum up, this has been one of the best decisions of my life. I've enjoyed my first year of college thoroughly, and I can't wait to start my second. I've found new lifelong friendships, new connections, everything. Sarasota is truly my new home. Rather, Ringling is my new home. So it's kinda like I'm vacationing back in Chicago...&nbsp;:p

In any case, this summer I have possible work to look forward to, as well as seeing all of you people again, possibly visiting my friends from here in Sarasota (they're not too far from home), and of course, LOLLAPALOOZA!!!! It's going to be epic this year. 

Can't wait to see everyone again! I'll be back Thursday (hopefully).

Disney was amazing.

Nicole is even more amazing.

Spring break has come and gone, and I'm happy to be back at RCAD&nbsp;again.

I have less than a month left before I go back home again, and I&nbsp;don't really want to leave.

I got housing in the Quads for next semester, and I'm really happy about that. Thankfully there was more housing than needed for 3-person units.

I volunteered to help out with Accepted Students Day, and I had a lot of fun with that. Also got to see the new Academic Bulding by the quads, and it's pretty nice actually. Really nice. 

Aaaaand that about brings us up to date, yeah? 

Ok. IM&nbsp;me, email me, call me, txt me, whatever if you want more in depth update for this past like...month. But I'll update again before&nbsp;I&nbsp;leave&nbsp;Sarasota.

Past week(s) or so have been rather great. Classes have been going well, and I've been doing my best to actually get all my work done and done well at that. Last Friday was the Photo Student showcase, which was rather fun. They had quite the set up too. Hukilau Hut with Sno&nbsp;Cones, cotton candy, Jones Soda, Popcorn, they really had everything. Well, everything if you want a sugar crash :p. Otherwise, the photography was good for the most part, and it's good to see what the upperclassmen are doing in our major. Did DDR&nbsp;and the Soup with Nicole as usual (BTW, that's her name. I&nbsp;figure it's about time I mention that). Quite the fun night! 

Oh, and let's not forget that we started doing photography in figure...as in undraped. Frightening at times, but otherwise it's been going pretty well. It also means I has more naked people on my computer than a junior high student, but oh well. At least it's tasteful :/ Although last time was rather peculiar...the model really loves skeletons...which he showed when we gave him one to pose with. *shudders*

All my other classes are also going well. Just took the art history midterm a couple days ago, and dear god was that easier than last semester. I didn't think we were actually going to get multiple choice for the slides section. Rather, I had no idea what exactly to expect, but I know I&nbsp;did well this time.

As for other non-class related stuff, things are better than ever! Apparently changing my relationship status on Facebook creates an uproar. But at the same time, I'm really happy with how things have turned out. Everything went smoothly on her end with her former relationship, and things are even looking up for her ex! It's quite exciting. And now I'm happily in a relationship with someone I&nbsp;really love. It's a great feeling :D. 

Valentine's Day was especially great. We went to see Coraline with a few other friends, really quite good. This Saturday we're going down to Disney for the day. Really excited for that, I haven't been in such a long time! Just means I need to finish up a lot of my work well before then. But I think I'm doing well for time with all of that. I&nbsp;just have a couple more rolls to shoot for photo, then I&nbsp;need to print like crazy. 

Speaking of crazy, I just realized that I'm gonna be home again in a couple of weeks for break! I wish I didn't have to leave, but it'll be nice to see those who are actually around. I know not too many of us are, but still should be good times. I can't believe it's already midterm. I love this first year so much, I&nbsp;really don't want it to even come this close to ending yet. Next year's going to be great, but I&nbsp;love the variety of work we're getting right now. 

Just got my housing stuff in today. One of our roommates just needs to get his housing deposit in, and we're good to go for the lottery. Yeah, I decided against Student Center cuz I&nbsp;couldn't find someone who would be willing to go right into that. It was a combination of that and the fact that another desirable opportunity came up at the right time. Hopefully everything will work out. 

Again, I&nbsp;love being here more and more everyday. This is probably the happiest I've ever been. :)"

Past couple weeks have been exciting, demanding, busy, a lot of things. But it's been great at the same time. 

Class wise, I've been surviving, and I do what I&nbsp;can. With that being said, I do love my classes. Sequential can drag on at times, but I'm happy with it. Figure is really a lot of fun, and I'm definitely starting to see improvements in my work. I just wish we could continue on more with the drawing thing, but the photography portion should be good. I'll speak more on that in a minute, actually. Image and Color is still my favorite class right now. Admittedly I'm doing the most work for that class, and I may be overworking myself a little bit, but what can I say. I love the freedom of that class and I always have a lot of fun with it. As for photo,&nbsp;still doing what I&nbsp;can to get my work done. I'll find time soon to get all of my film shot, and then I can develop!&nbsp;Yayz! Art history is SO much better this semester. Mostly because my teacher isn't an idiot this semester...and isn't a chicken (i do mean in the poultry sense). Writing studio, let's not get into that.

Personal-life wise, things are actually quite good. I'm growing less and less worried about things, and I'm definitely becoming more comfortable with myself, with others, with everything. Not that there's ever been any doubt that this is where I&nbsp;want to be, but I&nbsp;think now more than ever everything's just coming together for me. I love my classes, I love my friends, I love being able to just do art every day. It's really refreshing after high school, and I really can't complain about anything really. But what I really feel the desire to discuss is my friends. One friend in particular actually. I know I've mentioned her before, and I'm going back to it again. It's amazing how well you can get to know people, even in just these past 5, 6 months. She never ceases to amaze me, and her actions and words are her own constant reminder of how lucky and grateful I&nbsp;am to have her in my life. Recently we've definitely opened up a lot more to each other, about just about anything and everything. And I feel perfectly secure with this. I can't say I ever imagined finding someone like this this early on, but I'm more glad than ever because it means I have her with me for the next 3.5 years, and we can really enjoy every minute of it. I'm going to be completely blunt right now. &nbsp;I truly do love her. It might seem crazy, but it's true.&nbsp;
Moreover, my other friends that I spend a good amount of my time with are also great driving forces in keepng me on track and keeping me in good spirits. Really, I am more than grateful for all of them. And it's making college all the more enjoyable.

Back onto actual school-related subjects, housing contracts come out tomorrow. Hoping to stay on campus, by whatever means necessary. If i can get into the newly-assigned dorms, which are pretty much guaranteed, that'd make life a lot easier. Otherwise we get thrown in the lottery, and that's risky. A little too risky for me if I don't have to take it. 

Tomorrow I just have photo. After that there's the condom fashion show, and hopefully DDR&nbsp;at gaming club and the soup. 

Things are getting pretty exciting here. I love being here more and more everyday."

"event","So yeah...about that whole before I leave or after I get back update...here it is a week later. Whooooops. <br /><br />But yeah. Last couple of weeks of break were great, but getting back here was probably the best part of break :p.  But yeah. This week has been crazy in many respects. So here's the overview, and there will be cuts. <br /><br />Left home at 7ish AM to get to O'Hare for my flight. Turns out I was on the same flight as my roommate for both my flights out of O'Hare and Atlanta. So that was rather enjoyable. Oh, and let's not forget how amazing the first flight was. So apparently nobody wants to fly to Atlanta THAT early in the morning. So, our plane was pretty much empty. We both got our own rows to ourselves on the plane. We started joking about how we should just go close the door while we had the chance, or pay people to sit somewhere else so we could keep our full rows. It's nice to actually be able to stretch out on a plane. First class was nothing compared to this. In any case, we got to Atlanta, which is such a CRAP airport. Can't stand it really. We got lunch, and headed for our gate, which of course was completely filled up arleady. There were quite a few Ringling kids on our plane too. And the plane started running out of space in carry on for everyone's luggage. Oh well, thankfully I only took my backpack with me. No row to myself, but I did get seated by an old lady who had me open her peanuts for her and throw out her trash :/ Oh wellz. In any case, got back to SRQ, and moved over to the JetBlue gate. Called people, used the free wireless to facebook, and eventually my friend got back in. As it turns out another one of our friends had flown back with their mother, and they were getting a rental car. So yay for not needing a taxi! :p. But yeah, we got back to campus safe and sound. And quite frankly, coming out of Chicago and landing in Sarasota was probably one of the best moments of flying for me. But that's also prolly due to the fact that I used to get severely plane sick DX. Classes started up, and first day back was a 3-class day. It wasn't all that bad, but it still meant 3 hour classes, all pretty much one after the other. But after that classes were fine. My new teachers are great, and I think I'm going to be happy with this year.<br /><br />Time for the cut.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Stuff not relating to classes"">So I've been pretty happy with how things have been going with a certain very close friend here. I've actually never really been happier. I spend most of my time here with her, and I enjoy every second of it. In any case, obviously I fall for people pretty easily, and in this case it was pretty obvious. So this is where the fun starts. One night, I was not having such a great night, and I was visibly upset, and it was for a stupid reason. So she noticed, and also figured out that it may have been something more than just that. So this past week we've been talking about it quite a bit. Honestly, it helps that we can actually be this open about it and really talk about it. The way it's turned out has really been for the better. It didn't end up being some one sided discussion like it can be sometimes. And we've really managed to work things out. I think for the first time in a long time I'm actually going to be OK with the just friends thing. I mean, obviously the feelings aren't about to go away, but I never want to lose the closeness we have now. And we're doing our best to keep things the way they are. Obviously this whole situation is a little bit more complicated than just this, but there's only so much I'm going to put on LJ. In any case, things are good now for the most part. We're still just as close, and things don't feel too awkward. After the past couple attempts, it's a good change. I'm just glad we could work everything out the way we did.<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>   <br /><br /><br />So yeah, next week should be exciting. I'm especially excited to continue my Image and Color class. I&nbsp;got to start doing Oil pastel this past week for our project, and it's kinda nice seeing as most of my other classes are gearing completely towards photography. It's not that I don't love photography, and I'm in no way looking to switch majors anytime soon. I've wanted this forever, and I'm not giving it up. But at the same time, while I still have the chance to expand my horizons artistically, I'm going to take advantage of that. It's what I&nbsp;love about being at art school. I have the opportunity to actually try everything in a constructive environment where I can actually get real feedback and improve my work. But yeah, my Image and Color class lets me choose whatever medium I want, and given those kinds of boundaries I'm not going to take the safe choice and do photography for a class where I'm allowed to expand out. I'm basically taking 3 courses in photography ATM. It's time to take a break.<br /><br />So that's all for now. I'll update again at a later time.<br /><br />--Franticc<br />"

These past two almost two weeks have been frighteningly busy. Today's the first day in a while I've actually really had a lot of free time, and it's probably best that way for now just because I'm in process of recovering from a recent illness. Nothing all that bad, just a headache/cold. Still, me being everywhere but home isn't exactly helping it.

I've been really happy to see all my old friends again. As much as I enjoy Ringling, it's good to be home again, and it's good to see my other friends. On the other hand, I still do miss my Ringling friends. I'm amazed by how close i've grown to some of them already. It just makes me more excited to get back. And quite honestly, I&nbsp;am very excited to get back to Florida. Not only for the weather either. I think this may be one of the first few times I've been excited to start school again. I actually am excited for the classes I'm taking next semester. I know it's a lot of work, but it's going to be worthwhile. 

I'm not really about to go into detail about everything i've been up to for the past couple of weeks, but I think it's safe to say I've been keeping myself busy. Christmas was great. I always enjoy spending time with my family, and I have been able to see a few of my friends again in that time. I just wish i weren't sick these past few days.

In other news, I'm having a few weird anxieties about certain people, but whatever. It's nothing new for me. I'll be over most of it pretty soon I&nbsp;hope. And most of it is in vain anyway. 

Watching the office tonight for a while, so I'm pretty happy. I'll update again either before I leave or right when I get back

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I be back home again for break, just for a month. Yesterday was pretty crazy. I woke up around 7 EST (so basically 6AM here), and got to the airport around 9 with Nicole. She got her boarding pass after 9:30 when JetBlue people actually showed up. We got breakfast, went through security (which was so much easier than I&nbsp;was expecting). After that we went to my gate and hung out there. Now, let's remember that this was the first time I've been on a plane in 6 years, and I'd be flying alone for the first time. Nicole has been one of my best friends over the past couple of months, and having her there waiting with me did help. In any case, after the airline managed to get two people to give up their seats because the flight was oversold, we all started boarding. I&nbsp;was in one of the last zones. Nicole and I&nbsp;went our seperate ways, and I&nbsp;boarded. The flight went rather smoothly. No major issues, and landed in Atlanta pretty quickly. That's when the day got fun. Atlanta is even more of a clusterfuck than O'Hare, and apparently Delta's favorite transfer hub. Of course the first thing I do when I get to Atlanta is ask how to get to my next flight. So here's what the guy says. &quot;Ok, just go to A19, make a left, go down the escalator, and jump on the train&quot;...the train? Yes. Atlanta has a train that shuttles in between the different concourses. It's ridiculous. But my concourse was also 1/2 mile away from my first plane, so I guess is proved useful. Anyway, I&nbsp;was stuck in Atlanta for about 2 1/2 hours waiting for my plane back home. We had to board late because they were still servicing the plane. Eventually we started boarding. Now this part was fun. We were at a split gate, so there were basically 3 gates running out of the one exit from the airport. You had to go out the exit, down a staircase, and then follow some path outside that they had created to get to your plane. Atlanta wasn't exactly warm, and I was still in shorts. Not the best plan ever. In any case, I got on the plane, and noticed it was quite different. Yes, this plane was 2 seats on each side of the aisle. Not fun. At least I always get an aisle seat. So the guy next to me was asleep the entire flight. It wasn't really an issue til we started descending. Apparently that made him start snoring. And we had to spend half an hour descending because there wasn't anywhere for us to land right away at O'Hare. But yeah, we landed eventually, I&nbsp;found my dad pretty quickly, and got home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically from there&nbsp;I was just trying to get more accustomed to being at home, which is rather difficult. I&nbsp;mean, I knew my way around my own house obviously, but it still feels kinda weird being here. Just kinda. I'm sure I'll feel better about being here once I start seeing other people here. But still, at the moment I&nbsp;really do already miss my friends from&nbsp;Ringling. Also why I'm glad some of them have Skype so we can still keep in contact. In any case, I&nbsp;was tired as hell, so I actually kept falling asleep while I was on AIM. It was bad...but I eventually just went to bed, and woke up not too long ago. So yeah. That's my story thus far. I'll update this again later.

On the plus side I'm getting more sleep, I don't have classes, and I&nbsp;don't have much homework (Photo assignments...they're ever so fun). I'm glad that there are a few other people sticking around here as well. A few of my friends who I&nbsp;don't really hang out with as much as I&nbsp;used to because I&nbsp;kinda found my own little group within the big group. We watched Back to the Future Parts 1 &amp; 2 (3 is not worthy of our viewing), video chatted with a friend who left for break, and then eventually played some Smash and watched Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. 

On the downside, a good majority of my friends are either elsewhere in Florida visiting family or even back home. Thankfully it isn't that hard to keep in contact with them for the few days that they're gone, but it's still not the same without them all around. The group has definitely diminished quite a bit, and that's kinda sad, but at least they'll be back not too long from now. I'm also kinda wishing that I too could go back home or see anyone else that I&nbsp;know from home again right now. I&nbsp;haven't seen my family in a long time, and the last visitors I&nbsp;had from home were only here for a few hours. I dunno, it's kinda mixed feelings, y'know? I&nbsp;was talkin to my friend Adam last night, and he said he felt weird going home already, cuz it felt like he was just visiting his home, and like he didn't even live there anymore. And as much as I can't wait to see all my friends and family from back home, I can already kinda see where he's coming from. I love it here. This really is my new home, and I&nbsp;can't imagine being anywhere else. I mean, yeah, it was strange at first, but who doesn't get that right away? It's grown on me so much, and I just feel like this is the norm. It's weird to think that in just a few weeks I'm going back home, but only for a month. It really does feel like I'm going to be visiting. 

In any case, yeah. I'm still a bit hung up on stuff from the last post, and now I just miss my closest friends from here right now. But I'll be alright.
We've got a stack of movies left over, and those of us who are stuck here are all gonna have thanksgiving dinner together. It should be alright.

Happy Thanksgiving, LiveJournal people.

S'been another couple of weeks since the last time I posted here. Figure now's as good a time as ever to post again.

Things are good here! As usual. My 8:30 drawing class got cancelled cuz my teacher's going to his son's wedding, so I've got a 3 day weekend!&nbsp;Which is rather nice, seeing as normally I never get a day off. Unless by some fluke chance my drawing class gets cancelled again or both my photo and 3D&nbsp;classes or both my Writing and Art history classes get cancelled I won't get another day off until Thanksgiving break. My roommate got lucky and has a 4 day week every week...

in any case, I'm excited.And outside of that things have been going pretty well. Classes are going well, I'm havin a lot of fun, Florida is still just as awesome as always! Not that I'm not excited to see everyone again in December (or earlier if any of you wanna come visit ;). Come on, you know you want to!), but I can't really imagine being anywhere else right now.

So yeah, I'll update again later. I think. Maybe. Give it another couple of weeks.

I still love it here. Even though I usually have early mornings, it's all worth it when I consider what I'm getting out of this and just because I love this place. It's weird how fast I kinda got used to just being here. I mean, up until yesterday, I have no idea how long it's been since I called my parents. The thought of things being the way they were back home is kinda an oversight at this point. Don't get me wrong, of course I miss my family and friends from back in Illinois, but this really is my new home. It's hard to explain. It's just perfect here. 

But along with that, I'm also kinda not really changing in the way that I thought I&nbsp;would be. Y'know, I thought this would be easier to start fresh. But I'm kinda letting my past anxieties get the best of me. I wanted to leave it all behind, but it's kinda hard to just go back to the start. I'm working on it though. I'm hoping that I can either make progress or if things don't work out then at least find a better way of coping with things.

Other than that, things are still going pretty well. My friends are great, I do end up being rather busy a lot of the time, but it's all good. I manage to make time for everything that's important and even what might not be important to me. It's all good. I'm happy about how things have gone thus far. I&nbsp;mean, there's been some weird goings on recently, but I'm in for the long haul. I can't imagine being anywhere else but here. I love it here, and I'm not looking to turn back anytime soon.

So it's been almost 2 weeks since I updated last. Crazy, righ...?

In any case, college has been a lot of fun. Classes are a bit long, but they go by pretty quickly. My teachers are cool for the most part, and I always have a great time with my new friends. It makes college life really fun, y'know? Plus the whole being in art school thang is a blast. Especially here. Seriously, I actually feel like I'm at home already here. It's absolutely beautiful here, and the campus is open air and really nice. I've kinda gotten into a schedule of a sort for the week, and the weekends are always fun.

Speaking of which, it actually is the weekend now! Tomorrow I'm heading downtown with a bunch of my friends to check out places when they're actually open unlike our two past attempts. It's all good, though. It's nice to just walk around downtown.

I think I'm finally actually ready to start fresh. I'm really just now coming to realize that. I'm starting with a clean slate here. And it's time that I start to take control of the changes in my life. I've got four years, and I'm going to enjoy every last minute of it that I&nbsp;can.

I'm happy to say college life has been pretty good!  Orientation finished up pretty well. Saturday I didn't enjoy too much. Community service day = salvation army pain in the ass. I&nbsp;don't like taking out trash or squeezing limes for 2 hours (on top of the 2 hours of trash duty). At least we did our part for the community...? In any case, afterwards there was this sorta dance party at an aquarium!&nbsp;Pretty fun stuff, yeah? Our school rents aquariums.

Sunday was beach day, which was really nice for the most part. Here's the downsides for me: I&nbsp;forgot to take out my wallet so my moneyz got soggy and salty, and I forgot to put on sunscreen so my arms, face, and tops of my feet were burned. The feet burns were no fun whatsoever, but I've since healed. Oh, and I was stupid and didn't take off my glasses before I&nbsp;went in the water and I&nbsp;got hit by a big wave and they flew off. But I&nbsp;has new glasses now, so it's all good. The rest of the beach time was a lot of fun, and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it. The rest of the day was mostly relaxing. I forget if I&nbsp;did anything else that day. 

So Monday was the start of classes, and also the start of my waking up @&nbsp;7:30 every morning. Yargh. Early mornings ain't my thing. But my classes are fine, and I'm happy with them. Plus after classes I&nbsp;have a lot of free time so I&nbsp;get a lot of time to hang out, go places, enjoy my time in Florida, etc...it's all good!

So today I'm not sure exactly where we're going today, because the buses don't run so we're gonna have to stay within walking distance. But alas, we'll find something to do.

"event","Yep, I'm in Sarasota, FL at Ringling College of Art and Design!

It's fun times. Well, minus the dreary long speeches. Orientation is so very very long. Basically here's my story from Sunday on...

-Sunday, I left Wilmette, and ended up in Sheperdsville, KT. Sadly, this would be the nicest stop of the trip. The hotel was decent to say the least, and the fact that it was a two room with 2 TVs was rather nice. That way I was not forced to watch more of the olympics than most normal human beings would subject themselves to.

-Monday, I left Kentucky to venture further south towards school. We ended up in Tiften, GA. Oh my, Georgia. It was just a heap of southern fun. 

-Tuesday, we made it to Sarasota, FL in the early afternoon. Now here's the fun part of the story! The hotel. It was so decieving at first, with it's charm and nice architecture. Then the room. The 2nd time we had a sink that was outside of the bathroom, and the coffee did not run 24/7. We were given packets for the coffee maker in the room, which was terrible. Oh, and we got shafted on sugar and creamer (powdered creamer at that). So we ended up buying instant and regular cream for the time being.

-Wednesday I started moving my stuff into my dorm room. My roommate is pretty cool, and it's a livable space, y'know? It's just gonna take some getting used to, plus switching back to a loft bed will be interesting. Especially since I have to use a stepstool to actually get up to it. Sad, yes?

-Thursday, I finished moving in, and I started orientaiton! Yippee Hooray...? I think not...well, not so much. If I do remember correctly, the morning was check in, registration, get the common reading book, get your free macbook pro (HELLZ YEAH). Then after that it was do what you will til the buses come to take you to the big lecture day 1! The lectures...go...on...forever. 

In any case, after that we all headed back to campus, and had a ""cookout"". Kinda boring, but whatevs. Then family farewells, and then Playfair. Playfair, there is no really good way to describe this. It was interesting to say the least. And among the massive awkward introductions cohersed by a crazy DJ who apparently does voice overs in Hollywood, I met a few people who are genuinely nice people and who I would actually associate with again (some of whom I have started to already!) But seriously, art kids are the shiz.

And then today! Nyeeerrrrgh. I don't like waking up early. So I still need to get the hang of my alarm clock. I haven't actually used one in years and years and years. So it went off @ 6:30AM, then it went off again at 6:40 AM at which point I couldn't figure out how to turn off the alarm, but I sure could turn on the radio! So i went to the shower, which when you're the first person to use it, you get COLD SHOWER OF FUN! I think it was up to just below luke warm by the time I got out. So I went over to breakfast because somehow for orientation I got placed in the wake up early for breakfast group. Boring, just wanted to get out and get back to the room before the next activities of the day. At that point, we all went to yet another brief lecture, and into the common reading discussion! That was kinda fun at first, and I see the point of it now I guess. In any case, after that I went back to the commons for lunch, at which point I ran into a newfound friend from the previous night! It was fun stuff. She's pretty cool and such. So yeah, we both ran back to our respective dorms, and went to BIG LECTURE OF THE DAY! Safety is important, but I was seriously about to fall asleep. So at the break, we ran into eachother again, she had a couple other friends with her whom I'd met the night before as well. After the return of the lecture, the rest of the night's activites were a bit more enjoyable. I think I'm gonna be happy here, even if this is just orientation right now. Besides, I'm happy knowing that I'll actually have more time after orientation when they're not jam packing my schedule with random stuff.

So yeah, I'll update again at some later point in time. 

This has been fun.

Only two more days of orientation, the last day looks to be pretty great.

I was looking back through old posts on Xanga (who actually uses that anymore?), and I realized something. I was such an idiot to let myself get so pissed off and depressed over someone who was a complete bitchwad to me anyway! I think I'm coming to terms with the fact that as much as I wanted to stay friends with certain people back then, now I frankly couldn't give a shit! And that makes me feel a bit better knowing that I am capable of getting over things, even if it takes a couple years for me to come to my senses fully. I'm not naming names right now, but yeah. I feel better now. At least in that respect. More current things are still...meh.

In more recent events, I'm going to see The Dark Knight in IMAX this Saturday. Should be fun!

Yayz.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yeah, today was Trevia Day, righ? So I was hangin out with one of my friends who subsequently hangs out with someone I asked out earlier this year and now has gone down this spiraling path of brief/little awkwardness into ignorance into the ultimate facebook crime of de-friending. So obviously, it's everyone pass the yearbooks and sign. So for some reason I decided I'd try and be civil with her and switch, right? And I write something that I figure will be safe for someone who hates me with a burning passion, and whom I assumed would just write something along the lines of every other previous holiday/event she's ever given me a card/txt/email for, which goes under the guide of ""Hope your _____ doesn't suck as much!"" Sweet, isn't it? I wrote nothing that special, it's the generic ""this year's been pretty good, have a great summer"" that kinda jib jab. So I get the yearbook back, and she's actually being genuinely friendly again, and I think about what I wrote and I think I sound like an asshole when she's just now deciding to either make an attempt at being civil or going back to the way things were. And even more so, I don't know if she even wants to go back to the way things were. Honestly, this is like the pinnacle of the mini shitstorm of my year.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been pretty ok with dealing with this recently, or at least recently up until now, but still, it just re-hit me how much it fucking sucks that I lost her as a friend. Seriously, we were tight over the summer. And it really sucks for me to look back and remember that we actually were fine being around eachother for the longest time, and now she hates me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other part is I don't know who to blame: her for kinda pulling away more and more as the year went on, or me for screwing it up in the first place. Even worse even though I have been busy I still have way too much time to think about this shit, meaning i'm gonna overthink things over and over and over again. And of course where is my best friend who I trust more than anyone else? He's prolly hanging out with her right now. So that kinda sucks.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God knows I would give anything to have her as a friend again, even for the three months until college. I'd give anything for her to be friends with me again for even one day, or one hour. Just so maybe I could feel that same happiness that I had at the beginning of the year when everything was peachy-keen.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn I'm freakin weird(er) when I have this much time on my hands.

It's been a while since I've made a non-music post, so here it goes. 

For the past week I've spent my time getting ready for a scholarship show, one that everyone in AP Art and a few other seniors participate in. All I can say is MY FINGERS HATE ME RIGHT NOW. So, I have 6 pieces, and I needed 4 pushpins for each, so that's 24 pins. Sometimes the wall gets fussy, and that's when it kinda hurts. So, I finished hanging my stuff, and Bowers walks over and is all like ""your stuff is a bit cramped, why don't you move it over there"". So I take out all 24 pins and put them back in in another wall. Bowers comes back and is all like ""You might want to lay them out like this!"" and I have to take out all 24 pins AGAIN and put them back. And then after a couple other arrangements, I'm good to go. So let's fastforward a bit, and I'm helping out in the gallery just by moving other people's stuff, which means MORE PUSHPINS!!! And eventually, just yesterday, ""Hey Dave, you're a L Hook guy now"". 

*clears throat*
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

L Hooks are a bitch, btw. 

And then at the end we had normal pins to put up our artist statements, which is more of a hell. There's no safeguarding on those pins, they're just plain out metal pushing into your fingers when the wall gets fussy. So yeah, now my fingers are better, but still, OUCH MAN!

Oh, and same old same old with the other issues. I don't want to bitch about that anymore, it's just bringing me down.

SO that's all for now. I'm kinda bored. Later y'all."

Fun Punch is one of my new favorite songs. Yayz. Thank you Lolla Forum.<br /><br /><b>Digitalism</b> - These guys are just straight up techno. But they're cool, and they're catchy as all hell. I was happy with my choice of buying their album, and I can't stop listening to the super techno opener, Magnets<br /><br /><b>CSS </b>- I just started listening to them recently, and I really wish that they didn't have to cancel on Lollapalooza. Not that I have a problem with Matt and Kim, but I think there were more than a few people looking forward to seeing them. As you can see I'm listening to Let's Make Love and Listen to Death From Above<br /><br /><b>!!!</b> - These guys won the award of worst band name ever, mainly because it's completely unsearchable (which is why thankfully people pronounce their name chk chk chk, and thus has something to search for). They do get a little bit repetitive at times, but you gotta love them. Just listen to Must be the Moon, it's 7 minutes about what I believe was a one night stand, and then the ever repeating chorus where by the end, my friends have yelled ""WE GET IT. IT MUST BE THE MOON""<br /><br /><b>Daft Punk</b> - What can I say, they're pretty much associated with techno. I picked up Alive 2007 a while ago, and it's one of those things where even though it doesn't match actually being @ their concert (which is INSANE, btw...best way to top off Day one @ Lolla), it's still pretty damn amazing.<br /><br />and that's my story for now."

I LOVE albums like this. It's really hard to have cohesion like that without writing the same song over and over and over again *cough* FALL OUT BOY *cough* LINKIN PARK *cough* who said that? Anywho, There are a few I'd like to openly discuss/heavily endorse.<br /><br /><b>The Arcade Fire - Funeral</b>: I've mentioned this before, but this is most likely my absolute FAVORITE album of all time. You really do have to go from start to finish on this one. I mean, yes, obviously there are notable songs that you could listen to just by themselves, but they're so much more powerful when you listen all the way through. You figure this starts @ Neighborhood #1 - Tunnels. The whole neighborhood section of the album is beautiful, and the slight break for ""Un Annee Sans Lumiere is well needed, as it takes a slowing down break between Laika and Power Out. It's all very powerful at the same time. Then right after the neighborhoods, they go into a Waltz. A WALTZ. In modern music. It's a rare sight. Then obviously, Wake Up is one of the more powerful songs on the album (search Wake Up with David Bowie on youtube, it's amazing). Then The last three songs, Haiti, Rebellion (Lies), and In the backseat make this beautiful close to the album. It's more than worth a listen, and then another, and another, and another. <br /><br /><b>Interpol - Turn On the Bright Lights</b>: Although this one isn't so blatantly grouped together as the song titles do on Funeral, this is absolutely one of the most epic albums I've ever listened to. From Untitled to Leif Erickson, the album just flows well. After Untitled, it goes straight into Obstacle 1, one of the first singles. This is a bit of a heavier song, but it goes into the beautiful ode to New York, NYC. This is followed up by PDA, with the trademark Interpol harmonies, one note by every instrument in perfect snychronization. The album gets a bit heavier for Say Hello to Angels, goes back to the simple harmonies in Hands Away, and continues on into Obstacle 2, and Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down. Roland picks things back up again, but then fades into the beautiful the New and the finale of Leif Erickson. Seriously, the songs are all great, but you have to give it a full through listen.<br /><br />I'm stopping at this point for now.<br /><br /><u>PHOTO STUFFZ</u><br /><br />Hokay, so today I was out shooting for AP Art again, and for the first time in the process someone walked out while I was taking pictures of their house. Thankfully they didn't scream ""Go Away, long haired hippie!"". Apparently one of them is on the historical society board, and still shoots film. They were more intrigued than annoyed. So they let us continue, and it was nice to know that people in the community support what I'm doing.<br /><br />That's all for now<br /><br />btw, WHAM!"

"event","So here's a fun little thing that I just remembered.<br /><br />I <b>LOVE</b> old school Smashing Pumpkins. Sometimes I take the old music I used to listen to heavily for granted. And hell, Smashing Pumpkins would probably be one of the top contenders if I had to pick a favorite band. Prolly would be between them and the Arcade Fire. <br /><br />ANYWHO! Yesterday during AP Art, I guess my friend Willie noticed that I was wearing my Pumpkins shirt, and made a comment about how Billy Corgan might be playing Lolla this year (seeing the pumpkins, even with the new lineup, would make my life), and we started talking about the pumpkins and how amazing they are. And just now I remembered, they really are amazing (at least pre-Zeitgeist). I mean, there's a lot of simplicity to their music, but at the same time they make it really intricate and beautiful. Plus Billy Corgan has that classic voice that can never be duplicated. One of the best things about earlier Smashing Pumpkins was their versatility. There were obviously songs that were grungy and wonderful where you could really hear Billy Corgans voice fully unleashed, like in Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Zero, etc..., and then there's those really beautiful clean songs like Disarm, Landslide,&nbsp; Tonight Tonight, and my personal favorite, 1979. I think what people didn't like about Zeitgeist is that that versatility was pretty absent. But we'll overlook that. As long as they keep playing the old stuff (and possibly get back James Iha?!?! PORFAVOR?!?!?), they'll still be forever cool.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />That's all, I haven't made a music post in a long while. I think I will again later, but in a longer form."

(My english teacher is CRAAAAAZY and doesn't know how to teach poetry)<br />I got to sleep til 11<br /><br /><u>CONS</u><br /><br />OH MY FUCKING GOD WAS I BORED TODAY. Seriously, I spent a majority of my day sitting at home watching TV or facebooking/waiting for people to sign on. Unfortunately my friends had other plans set out pretty quickly. Plus driving conditions weren't exactly wonderful, so I couldn't really go too many places. Anywho...Yeah. Bored today. Still better than being @ school though, even though it would've meant that i'd get to see my friends.<br /><br />MOVING ON!<br /><br />Yargh. Just Yargh. Things haven't really changed for the better since my last post. I need to change that. I rather enjoy being happy. Or at least I prefer it over my current state. I've definitely come to terms with the fact that not everything is going to work out the way I'd like it to. At this point I'm settling for the way things used to be. But even that is looking like it's impossible, and that really depresses me. At least I was happy back when things were the way they used to be. Not to say I'm not still enjoying the other aspects of my life, because honestly, I'm not letting this completely take over my life. But it's still a problem. I just wish there was some way I could just change everything back to normal. But alas it seems a little bit impossible.<br /><br />So yeah, this be what I think about when I have too much time to myself. Scary, huh.<br /><br />Once again I'm happy to drop the vagary outside of LJ if you'd like to know more or help me. If you know my number, or my screen name, or just see me in school and are like ""Hey! You're that guy!"", I'm cool to talk about it. For the most part, those whom I actually trust are the ones who take the time to read this. Funny how that works out.<br /><br />So yeah, that's all for now. I think I might go to bed soon, it's getting late-ish. <br /><br />--Franticc"

Joyous of all days!

So yeah. Umm...I dunno. You'd think things would be good with finals over and all that fun stuff, right? Should be, but I feel kinda...empty. Something's def. missing right now, and I'm just trying to figure out what that is. I dunno, I mean things have been a wee bit weird lately. Plus I've had a couple of really really bad outbursts where I ended up acting like I did in 8th grade, something I'd really never like to go back to. I've gotten more control over myself since then, and I guess I just lost it. And it was over really petty shit too. So now I gotta try to fix that and make sure it doesn't happen again. 

Past that, things have been OK. For the most part I'm pretty happy right now. Y'know, minus all the random drama. And hopefully everything will end up alright. We shall see what happens. I just wish I knew what the hell is making me freak out like this.

"event","SO! I feel like updating again...kinda.

Last couple o' weeks have been...interesting? FINALLY finished my AP Art Project, and now I'm working on my 2nd project. Yaaaaaay, I get to go back to photography! My duct tape shoe injury has finally healed, and I can play my bass worry free again, which makes me very happy, although I am a wee bit peeved that the bass I wanted to order is now backordered for quite some time, and it's not just in one place, it's actually EVERYWHERE. So that kinda sucks, but i'll get it eventually.

MOVING ON! I've managed to find myself a new injury! So I for whatever reason was convinced by my friend to start riding my bike. Prolly a good idea in theory, right? I get more exercise, which is always a good thing, and it's faster than walking places. Here's the issue! I have enough coordination to ride without hands for short distances, but not enough to keep myself on my bike even with both hands. SO! I managed to fall off my bike, and landed knee first into the pavement. And now i have two huge scabs under my knee. One of them is not a big deal, cuz it's far enough down on my leg that it doesn't affect my walking, but the other one refuses to heal up all nice like, and it's directly under the kneecap, so I feel that every time i move my right leg. Whatever, that'll heal up soon enough. 

Along with this, recently I've had some...err...personal issues...one of you knows what i'm talking about, but for those of you who don't and for whatever reason are interested, just ask me. 

Oh, and I saw that new Resident Evil movie. It's good if you like plotless zombie violence! But if you actually want a real storyline in your movie, this is not the movie for you."

"event","SO! It's been quite a while since I've posted here, and I thought, sure, I think I'll post again!

Let's see here...last time I posted was after that death storm, so I'll pick up from there.

So, as I said I would, I did go and photograph the destruction. That, my friends, is quite enjoyable. Although the days following the storm also included a lot of gawkers, both young and old, including who I believe was Harold Ramis (director of Caddyshack, played the dean of admissions that took ecstasy in the movie Orange County). He was filming for some reason or another. Anywho, along with the people walking around with their digital cameras included the wonderful rich bitch driving gawkers! Since there was a major traffic light down one street over from us, a LOT of people decided to turn off onto the next street over to avoid the traffic. What this meant for us was an army of Lexus and BMW owners driving down our street, stopping, making some mention of it to whoever they were on the phone with at the moment, and then snapping a picture or two with their cell phone camera. Then they drove off, merrily on their way to find more traffic. It's funny how that all works out.

Anywho, after that all cleared up, I went to Projekt Revolution! Quite a fun time, although it made me love and miss Lollapalooza more and more and more for every minute I was there. Let's see here, for starters, the security check. Now, at Lolla, you get the bag check, and they send you on your way into the park. At projekt, they get to pick whether or not you get a frisking depending on what falls between your legs. Plus they have really weird rules. Apparently I can't bring in a wallet chain even though it's tiny and harmless. Also, since apparently I'm the type who would try to injure people with a bottle cap, I can't bring that in either! So for a while, I was carrying around a liter of water without a cap. But I digress. Moving on, Merch tents. Lolla had a MUCH more organized merch tent line. They had a line of about 20 people working, yelling, and throwing stuff, making things much more efficient. Projekt, an hour wait with two people working the line. At least there was a wonderful man who sat on his friend's shoulder and screamed ""FREE CONDOMS!"" while he blew up a condom balloon, and started pointing in multiple directions, obviously trying to point out where he got his new ""balloon"". Anywho, after buying a wonderful $8 slice of pizza and a $4 bottle of water minus the bottle, we headed over to the revolution stage. Here's the high point of my day. MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE. SOOOOO much fun! After that, we headed over to the mainstage area. At first we sat in the wrong seats, but it was all cool after we came back to see HIM (we took a break to go wait in line while Placebo was playing). We then stuck around through MCR, Taking Back Sunday (a (not so) guilty pleasure of mine, and a favorite of my friend), then through part of Linkin Park. Funny thing is I don't really like Linkin park, yet I went to their headlining tour. Whatevs. They were alright. Although it was really nice of Chester to drop an F-bomb after he brought his kid on stage. Even if he was wearing those sound blocking headphones, I still think he could hear something screamed over the P.A.. Anywho, on the way back, we passed by the Spindle in Berwyn (TOTAL WAYNE'S WORLD MOMENT!), and I took a few pictures, because Walgreens wants to take it down, and I didn't know when I was gonna get another chance to go to Berwyn. Got home eventually. 

Now the boring stuff. SCHOOL! My adviser is still lame-tastic. But my schedule is pretty alright! 1st period I have free again, but it kinda sucks now b/c this year NOBODY has 1st free. Then I've got AP Art with Bowers, which is tremendous fun. After that I have my two actual academic classes for the day, English and Spanish. BTW, my english teacher is craaaazy. In a bad way. After that, it's all easy. Lunch, Sequential art with Bowers (yet again...he's either gonna love me or hate my by the end of the year), Music Theory, and then Lifetime Activities with my simulator teacher from driver's ed. It's one of the reasons why I'm sooo glad I'm not doing 5 APs like a lot of my friends are.

And now we move on to present day. This weekend I've managed to put off my AP art project until now, which is prolly not the best idea cuz when I paint for too long, I go slowly insane. I've got to paint 7 shoes still, then I need to assemble them and hide the parts that aren't painted. But i figure I'll leave all of the assembly work for monday and tuesday. In other Bowers news, I need to finish up my sequential project when i get back because I'm still not done with the blue pencil work.&nbsp; Also, I have to write my spanish project ""contract"" by tomorrow, so I need to figure out what I'm gonna do and how to make sure that I actually accomplish it. Finally, I'm waiting on a few things. Just waiting...it's drives a person mad.

Aaaaaand that's all for now. BYE BYE NOW!"

"event","So, I'm sure all of those of you who went to school today know of the school becoming a prison today. Here's the kicker for me. I was ALMOST at the doors when that first announcement came on, then I looked over, and there stands a parapro who isn't about to let me get away. SO I walked around the school for a while, found a few people that I knew, then when that 2nd announcement came on, and we all thought we could leave. I was literally out the door, but when we found out we were still stuck, i got pulled back in, while my friend escaped off.

So I sat with Perry and Kenny in the main hallway on the first floor back by the science labs. It's kinda fun watching out the glass doors to see what's goin on. I felt kinda bad for the 303 Minivan that was waiting for someone out at that back exit. 'Specially during the crazy wind. Anywho, eventually they opened up a classroom or two, and we sat around for a while. Eventually, we saw everyone else walking around, so we all left, I gave my dad a call b/c he had been waiting outside since 3:30. We got let out of the school soon enough, I found my dad, and after several trees blocking streets, I got home in roughly an hour. Pulled around back, where the alley was clear minus a couple of those little neon green plastic slow children. Stupid neighbors. I started walking around by the side of my house to get out of my backyard, and there was this tree down blocking the gate. SO! I had to go in through the backdoor, but we had power, A/C, and interwebs. So I was happy.

So yeah...nothing much new now. Tomorrow we don't have school anymore, so I'm gonna go photograph the destruction.

That's about all, so talk to you all laterz."

"event","SO this weekend I've been off at lollapalooza, enjoying the wonderfun of music, overpriced foodstuffs, and crazy drunks in the middle of the afternoon! Still, amazingly fun times. I've been going up by train with Perry, I know most of you know him. First day was rather fun, although it did take a while to figure things out. First band I saw was Elvis Perkins in Dearland, which was kinda cool, but I guess I'm not so into the whole indie/alternative/folk thing. Also went to go see the Polyphonic Spree, which was absolutely amazing! They seriously are the happiest people on earth. Plus, near the end of their set, they did their wardrobe change (into their white robes), went through the audience (and pretty much one row away from me at that), and they played this REALLY AMAZING COVER OF NIRVANA'S SONG LITHIUM. Seriously, that was the most fun I've had in a while. Plus it's funny how everyone in the audience knows all the lyrics to that song. Maybe that's because it actually has clearly spoken lyrics. I then moved over to Electric Six, which was pretty sweet. They were rather funny, and also made claims about building giant Microwaves that would send people 30 years into the future. Then later into the night, we went to see Daft Punk and their pyramid of techno-rave madness.

Today, we brought along Schwartz, and considered taking him to the Tag-a-Kid thing so he couldn't escape to go to work (he's lame like that). Anywho, the first band that we went to go see was I'M FROM BARCELONA!!!!!!!!! Seriously, been waiting for that for a long while, and this was their first show in America as well! Anywho, we got some decent spots to stand, and I went over to the friendly Swedes from the band who were selling T-shirts. Bought my shirt, walked back over, and we waited for them to start. Let's just say that between Emmanuel (the lead singer) crowd surfing on an inflatable raft, climbing the speaker stacks, then promptly jumping off them, and pulling a guy out of the audience who claims to have never had the chicken pox come on stage and do a kazoo solo, it was pretty damn awesome. Anywho, moving on from there, we ended up just doing a lot of listening, kind waiting around for the next band we really wanted to see. We finally got to the band we wanted to see, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! Wonderful band. Decent set. After that, we kinda chilled out for a while, and then kinda half watched/listened to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. It was starting to rain on and off at this point. We headed over towards the other side of the park so we could get a decent place for Interpol. We kinda half watched/listened to Patti Smith, who was pretty damn good, and then INTERPOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REALLLLLLY good set by them, so I thoroughly enjoyed that. Tomorrow, not as many good bands, but it'll still be pretty awesome. I'm mostly excited for Iggy and the Stooges (who, by the way, I'm suprised aren't playing one of the nighttime headlining spots).

So, that's all for now. I'll post again later."

Anywho, It's gonna be a while.

Later everyone."

"event","So, apparently the Squirrel Nut Zippers decided to reform earlier this year. That's pretty fucking exciting for me, because I started liking them a few years after they went on an indefinite hiatus. Also, they were in their prime back in the mid-late 90's, when I was still listening to whatever my dad made me listen to (He lkes oldies)...and weird al. So, now, they're back on tour! as you could probably assume, I was rather excited when I saw chicago on the list.<br /><br />HOWEVER. After going to the House of Blues website (their venue of choice), the listing for the show said that it was an 18+ w/ID show. <br /><br />*clears t hroat*<br /><br /><u><b><font size=""5"">""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!""</font></b></u> -Dwight, <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i><br /><br /><b>DAMNIT I WANNA GO SEE THE FUCKING ZIPPERS!!!!!! WHY DO I HAVE TO BE 18 TO ENJOY THE REUNION OF A BAND OUT OF THE 90's SWING REVIVAL ERA!?!?!?! MY MONEY IS THE SAME COLOR AS THAT OF ANYONE 18+!!!!! LET ME GO TO THE FUCKING SQUIRREL NUT ZIPPERS CONCERT!!!!!! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!11<br /><br /></b>Alright, now that I got that out of my system, I do have a bit of good news. I am now going to Projekt Revolution, and that means I finally get to see MSI, along with some other bands that are supposed to be pretty damn good live. So that's exciting!<br /><br />Also, I got the book I ordered off of eBay, The Blight at the end of the Funnel. (It's a 70s/80s punk rock photography book, and then some.) It's damn good<br /><br />Alrighty, that's all from me for today. <br /><br />Have a nice day"

"event","Good news: Got the new Velvet Revolver CD, and so far it's pretty damn sweet. Also, been trying to work off a new slap riff I came up with last night, and that seems to be going alright. Hopefully be finished with that soon.

Bad News: Got the rejection facebook message from Perfect Potential (the band I tried out for). Apparently the bass position got filled by some incoming junior. Maybe he was better than me, maybe they picked mostly based on people they knew pretty well, maybe they picked him because he's a junior, and i'm a senior. Whatever the reason may be, the long and the short of it is I'm once again in search of a band. Oh well. At least it was worth a shot.

Still waiting on a book I ordered off of eBay, hopefully it'll show up by thursday. That'd make me happy. Also, waiting on a CD from eBay, but that I can understand the wait on b/c i just sent payment on monday. Hopefully it'll show up within the week. 

Oh, and one last thing.
NEXT WEEK BE MY BIG LIST O' CD's WEEK.

So, as you all know, on Tuesdays, stores put out new CD releases. Here's what I plan to go pick up on July 10th.

-SMASHING PUMPKINS - ZEITGEIST (been waiting for this one for a while)
-BAD RELIGION - NEW MAPS OF HELL
-REEL BIG FISH - MONKEYS FOR NOTHING AND THE CHIMPS FOR FREE
-GOGOL BORDELLO - SUPER TARANTA
-INTERPOL - OUR LOVE TO ADMIRE

this is more than my usual one or two obviously. So, yeah, gotta prepare for that.

That's about all."

"event","So today, I went over to look at the mail that had come today. Somewhere in that pile was a ""Container Store Preferred Customer"" card with my name on it. WHY?!?!?!

Ok, let's look at the facts.

A. I haven't been in the container store in about 6 or 7 years.

B. I haven't recieved their catalog in about 6 or 7 years.

C. I don't go to the Container store EVER.

D. I have NO idea why they'd send me this.

Seriously, makes absolutely NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.

Also, having trouble trying to find the new Winter Sounds album. No Best Buy stores anywhere near here have it, and neither does Circuit City. I can't check on availability with Target, but I think I'll go check sometime soon.

Past that, summer school driver's ed, and tonight I have an intro to painting class (AP art requirement thingy). Alrighty. That's all for now. Later.

"event","So, today has been pretty ok.

Started off @ Driver's Ed summer school (Yes, as one/some of you know(s), I am just now starting driver's ed). Classroom portion is ok, and I'm doing decently on the simulator (87 on my first one. I CAN CHANGE LANES TO DA MAX, YO.) And I've been out practicing a little bit in my dad's red honda. it's been good, i think.

After summer school today, I went home for a short while, and then went off to an audition for a new band. Twas pretty laid back, and I only had to play a couple of songs. I hopefully will make callbacks on this, i just need to pick a slower song so that they can hear the tones...(btw, this is being run by theater kids, hence it's ending up like a theater audition. Whatever happened to ""Let's jam, (an hour later) This is pretty awesome, let's start a band."" ""A'ight."" ""A'ight.""?) So next month when Yant gets back from Japan, I might make callbacks, and maybe then from there, the band.

That's all for now. Laters, you all. 

BTW...MUSE OR INTERPOL?!?!? WHICH ONE DO I CHOOSE TO GO SEE @ LOLLA?"

"event","So this morning, I looked outside my house, and there was a creepy 40-50 year old man who was a little more than overweight, was standing in the street rubbing his manboob, or moob for short, repetivitely.<br /><br />*clears throat*<br /><br /><u><b>WHAT THE BLOODY FUCK!?!?!</b></u> THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH IMPRESSIONABLE CHILDREN, AND EVEN IF IT WASN'T <b>PEOPLE STILL DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU RUBBING YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING STREET!</b><br /><br />Right, now that that's done with, My 12-string currently has 5 new strings and 6 old strings, so it's kinda like an 11-string guitar. I gotta finish up changing the strings and get the 12th string back on my guitar.<br /><br />That's all.<br /><br />Later everyone"

"event","So, According to the crazy texan and a few other people who have seen the film ""Gnome: Origins"" in recent weeks, I apparaently looked skinny. SO, seeing as I have a copy of said film, I went back to go look, and low and behold, I actually looked kinda skinny. NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT AN OPEN INVITATION TO GO FIND THE MOVIE AND WATCH IT! I made two appearances on this, and one of those appearances was someone running by me, then running back, tackling me, and then kicking me repetitively.

On another note, my I'm From Barcelona CD came! WHOOOOOOOO INDIE SWEDISH POP!"

"event","Fetal pig, need I say more?

Things have been alright recently. Late start was nice today, and I didn't have to go to spanish, so I went to the video art room and sat in for a period. Photo was a sub, and for me, b/c all the AP kids are taking up the computers, I kinda used it as a blow off period. Lunch, we sat outside, and that was rather nice. Good weather recently, yes? Bio, i don't think I have to repeat myself. Gym, more tennis, and then english, we started watching Little Miss Sunshine. Funny movie! Anywho, that's really all for now. I'll update again later."

"event","Yeah, so for a LONG while, I was looking for ANYTHING to work on it photo. I had no new stuff, and I wasn't really working. Then I shot one roll o' film, worked on that forever, and about a week or two ago, finished working on that and turned in 6 mounted prints (all color slide (positive) film, scanned and printed off ze computer), then as soon as I finished that, I had digital busywork, but the next day, I had two pages of film to work on, scanned 8, printed 5, and I'm now in process of mounting them. BUT WAIT! Today, I got back all of my film from Tuesday, (1.5 rolls-ish), and now I have 49 slides of which I can at least narrow down to 24, most likely less. But I gots a lot o' work to do during the rest of the semester. I don't know if I should be happy or sad."

"event","Not too long ago, I got back from one of the most painful and longest show hangings I've ever done. I showed up at that Community house (otherwise known to you some of you peoples as that building above the WYO) pretty much right after school, with a bunch o' senior's (like highschool, not geriatrics) artwork. SOOOOO many problems, like when we got there, the room we were supposed to hang in had an art class full o' little kids and some teacher who doesn't want children to hear the sound of hammers. They cleared out, we moved all the artwork into this hallway, then started moving things around a bit. Finally, we started to hang things. As we started on a second wall type thing, we learned the hard way that the people who gave us the room didn't check to make sure that the hanging area they gave us was impossible to nail nails into. Eventually, we came up with a valid solution, and finished hanging up everything, with a few minor problems in between. At this point, I had been in there for 5 FUCKING HOURS. Hanging a show should not be strenuous work!!! Ah well, it's all done with, and I got paid, so I'm happy. Later, peoples."

"event","You know, I was ready to make this really angsty, in some ways insulting post, but i just decided to delete the whole thing. 
I'm just going to get to the point:

School was boring, Band Aid was okay minus 3 Miles East and Banned from the Basement. Improv Shows were good, people after the show pretty much ignored me, so I went home. Also, Michael Mui is becoming progressively creepier. I know it's not a good idea to judge people when you hear a conversation from the middle of it, but when someone said ""No Michael, that's just rude. It's ok for them to do that because they're dating"", I figure he's made some oh so creep-tastic proposition to someone, or has forgotten about the proposition and moved ahead with his plan.

To wrap things up, kinda boring weekend thus far. Maybe tomorrow will be ok"

"event","Name one song for every letter of your username<br /><br />Foo Fighers - ""<b>F</b>ree Me"". quite possibly one of my favorites off of the first disc of In Your Honor. Got a very catchy riff that goes through the entire song. Plus In Your Honor was just a great album, especially for me the entirely acoustic 2nd disc.<br /><br />Oysterhead - ""<b>R</b>adon Balloon"". Very relaxing. Plus I happen to love Oysterhead. This is one of the songs Trey Anastasio (or as Les Claypool refers to him as in some videos during the recording, ""Trey Antipasta""), and it's a very mellow acoustic type of song. Plus there's other good Oysterhead out there.<br /><br />The Misfits - ""<b>A</b>stro Zombies"". Classic 70's Misfits in the Danzig era when they still couldn't pick a permanent drummer. Waaaaaaaay before the Michale Graves and Chud era. Point being, good song, classic Misfits kinda mix between punk and 50's incomprehensible doo-whop.<br /><br />The Arcade Fire - ""<b>N</b>eighborhood #1 (Tunnels)"". Just got into the Arcade Fire, really cool band. They're very much alternative indie. This one's off of Funeral, which they recorded in a hotel room in Quebec (?) (Somewhere in Canada). Just picked up Neon bible, which they recorded in a church, and even used the gigantic pipe organ on a few tracks. Anyway, this particular song has a nice beat to it, and it's a good start to the album. Plus they have like a 10 person touring band and they aren't Slipknot. (Oh god, why did you put me in a car with the slipknot sing-along?)<br /><br />This is Cinema - ""<b>T</b>rapula Fruit"". I just happen to LOVE This is Cinema. This is the longest song off of their debut EP ""Birth"". What I like about it is it completely sums up their style. The first part of it is kinda a slower, more piano and vocal oriented song. Then, about 3 minutes before the end of the song, it sounds like it's about to end, but then here comes in this loud guitar, and then there's a little instrumental interlude, leading to a sorta soft voice, and then here goes the snare drum and BOOM! Ben Babbit is scream-singing! He REALLY gets into this song at concerts when they play it.<br /><br />Clap Your Hands Say Yeah - ""<b>I</b>n This Home on Ice"". Really enjoyed their first album (including this song). It's a very indie kinda song, plus it does get a bit stuck in your head after a while. Anywho, cool band, cool song. I'm actually gonna keep it short for this one. <br /><br />System of a Down - ""<b>C</b>UBErt"". This song just gets stuck in my head SOOOOO easily. Love the early SOAD stuff. Especially their first album. This song is very catchy, and really I enjoy the rhythm of the song. They worked it out really well with the lyrics, and then the Chorus is just cool. They don't really do anything like this again until ""Steal This Album!"", so it's nice to see this in the early stages.<br /><br />The Ninjaviduals - ""<b>C</b>lose Enough to Touch"". This one was a real crowd favorite back when they still played. This had to be one of the only songs everyone sang along with besides ""Mosquito Flying Man"". The Ninjaviduals just had a way with making these really catchy, amazing songs that everyone loved. Stand in the front, and you join the huge crowd of people who dance around and scream ""CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH!"" at every chorus. Best local shows you could go to. Well, at least when they played the Warming House. People @ the YO are a bit strict about that kinda thing, and I never got to see them @ the Kenilworth Club (if they ever played it).<br /><br />That's about all. Thanks for reading this (assuming you all did)"

"event","So, I didn't win at Guitar Idol, but I did alright I guess. 

I was #6, and ended up being the 3rd up. SO! I was mostly prepared, a little nervous. Then in the middle of my thing, I kinda stopped because someone was laughing at me. I picked up, finished, and then when I got back to my seat, Jacob leans back and says ""Dude, your fly was open"". FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. Also, I kinda got nervous, and didn't do so perfectly.

In any case, Kenny performed 2nd to last (Mike showed up at the last minute, pulled out his guitar, and then played). Anywho, judges judge, come back, and announce the winner. Kenny got picked first, by the winner from last year. He did a really good job with his fingerstyle. Then the kid with the bottleneck slide got picked, and then the krazy tapping kid and the crazy ass slap bass guy. Finally, audience vote goes to the bass player who's been here all three weeks. So, I didn't get in to the finals, but it was alright. I guess that's what I get for breaking the cardinal rule of bass playing and using a pick. 

SO, I packed up, and walked out of the store, got a ride home from Kenny. BUT NO! I couldn't leave just yet. Jacob runs back to his Geo, and then throws a pink stuffed dog at me. I'm surpised he found it. Anywho, I walk back over to Kenny's car, and I say ""Hey Kenny, do you have a problem with littering?"". So, he opens up the sunroof, and I threw the dog back at Jacob's Geo. (It missed though. I think it's still probably sitting in the parking lot.)


And now i'm here. So, I'll probably go back next week to go watch George and Kenny in the finals. It'll be fun. Plus, hopefully they'll both do well.

"event","Cici, I don't know how you can manage to keep up with them all day<br /><br />Today, I hung out with Jacob and George...well, to start at least. Jacob picked me up at Treasure Island, and we headed down to Edens Plaza. Btw, his Geo is really...interesting? Anywho, I got some lunch at Panda Express, Jacob went looking for a tux, then got Cinnabon. Just as a side note, it's really hard to eat Panda while Jacob is switching lanes continuously, and then makes sudden stops and/or hard turns. We went to go pick up George, and as soon as his hair sorta dried, and I finished most of my lunch, we headed off for mini golf. <br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""The Backstory to Mini Golf"">So one night, me and Jacob are talking on AIM, and eventually I convince him to join me in Mini-Putt online. Yes, we were playing miniature golf online. Anywho, It was a wee bit dificult with these annoying server messages (someone screwed up the whole system and gave everyone the ability to send out stupid messages to everyone playing, which also happened to show up right in the middle of the screen, and if you closed them, you took a shot and most likely screwed yourself over). Anywho, Jacob declared a rematch, and in the middle of it, his screen closed. So we decided to play mini-golf for real.<br /></div>And that leads us to today.<br /><br />We get there, wait in line for a while, then go inside. This happens to be glow-in-the-dark mini golf too! I learned today that I'm absoulutely terrible at mini golf. I actually hit it onto a different part of the course more than a few times. Even worse, on the last hole, where the worst you can technically get is 3, I managed to get a 4 by somehow missing the giant area where you were supposed to hit it into, and making it go around it. Anywho, we totaled it all up, George won. Then we played random arcade games in the lobby. That was sadly amusing, and also we spent more money than we should have on that. We went back to Jacob's apartment, which smells like Mountain Dew slurpees. He's got cool cats though. Anywho, we watched Shaun of the Dead for a while, played some super expensive Xbox game that he had, and then guitar hero 2 for a while. Eventually, Leobel and Mac's sister (AKA charlotte...I generally know her as mac's sister.) We all went off to FlatTop. On the way, I got to listen to Jacob, George, and Leobel's ""Sing along with every Slipknot song Extravaganza!"" Anywho, we eventually got there. Expensive stuff, but ok. George had like 7 bowls of stir fry. Kinda cool/funny/disgusting, but we had a few more hours in the parking garage than we anticipated, and cost Jacob a dollar more. We all got back to Jacob's, then ended up going to Mac's sister's house. Btw, that was quite possibly the worst bitch seat experience I've had in a while. We spent a good 10 minutes trying to pick a movie, then ended up watching Predator. About an hour later, mac shows up and he's like ""...What the hell are you doing here?"". Yeah, I wasn't exactly expecting to be hanging out with his sister either. So, Mac's sister drove all of us home, and now I'm here.<br /><br />Honestly Cici, how do you manage to do this every weekend?"

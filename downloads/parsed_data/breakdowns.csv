"event","its sad, because the one thing i want to do works out only for alittle
ive been in the same band w the same people for years now
but nothing has come out of it except some good music
and some good arguements, its pathethic.
i dont understand it much but people obviously dont give a shit
they say i dont but i do and what can a person do when the other people don't care?
all you can do is try.. and i did, i practice by myself and wait for phone calls and even make phonecalls but everyone is always so busy. its a waste and a horrible one.

the only perfect thing i have going for me is claudia and that is something
that is always there for me whenever time of day or weather and always works out.
i cannot choose what people will do ever and i have learned that
people will turn there back on you no matter how good friends they are.
thats why i beleive in karma and i can just watch down on it and laugh really.
i hope things work out for everyone because things aren't on my side this month at all, maybe next month? farewell.

"event","ok well i know i never update this journal and personally i never feel like doing so.


im bored and quite sad about a major even that happened in my life this weekend.

on friday night while i was at the hookah bar with about 15 friends i recieved a call that one of my best friends craig grumet since kindergarden had got into a car accident and was being rushed to the hospital. i was quite intoxicated so i didn't think very much of it other then oh he will be ok its prob just a minor injury, sucks for his car. then maybe 45 minutes or so later i had received another call telling me that craig had passed away. it was surreal and still is, and i don't really want to talk much about it. tomorrow is the 'shiva' if thats how u spell it and basically my whole grade + seniors + whoever was close to him are missing school. wheatley won't be the same for along time. it was a huge loss. pay ur respects and visit the memorial site off the service road across the street from wheatley road.

"event","wow, its been awhile has it not?
last night me matt, michele and will took the train to the city at about 4pm.
we got to the roseland ballroom at about 5pm and the line was around teh fucking block, literally. so after waiting on line for like an hour, and it not moving, me and matt decided to get our blaze on. we asked some random guy to cop us an L and he got us one for free.. what a present!
so we then head over to roy rogers where i roll the blunt in the bathroom then we went back and waiting to smoke.. the city was to shady to walk around just puffing a blunt so me and matt waited for jeff to come and we just sat in his car burning the L infront of a fucking restaraunt. LOL and while i spark it a cop on a fuicking horse rolls by and doesn't notice.. what luck.

so we get there and coheed is playing - and they did play mad good..
then thrice played - they were even better, cos they have breakdowns.
thursday then played - their old stuff was good liek usual, i dont like their new stuff at all.. but i must say the millions of confetti that was dropped after jet black new year was pretty fucking trippy.. 

after the show ended it was about 12am, and we walked from roseland to penn state just checking out the city.. good times. we slept on the train ride him, i got home at liek 130. i was exhausted so i passed the fuck out.

so basically my day consisted of sleeping till 12 and then going to school for 3 periods. after school i just chilled n played hockey bc my band is fucking so busy that they can't even call me to tell me theres no practice.
i do not know whats become of candela.. and it really is a shame.
somedays they want to play and they are into it
the others they just act like scumbags and dont care about anything
its fucked up.
hopefully there will be a upside to this band thing."

"event","so i basically can't recall much of the summer of 03'..
i guess that can be a good thing?
this summer was one of the best, yet one of th worst
bc all of the seniors left. basically all of my older friends are now gone or still here but not much is the same.
aj left last night for deleware, and rintel had the ILL ass back to school party. i was just all fucked up there seeing how school will be next year with the new seniors and me being the junior. funny shit - cos i will be making soooo much money this year i cannot wait.
sellin chron to newbies is always fun. especially the hot ones.

the last weekend consisted of jony v having his crazy ass parties
so i guess it was the ill CLOSER of this so called vacation.

hopefully school will be fun again when i go back and not to gay.
more to come: for now. peace."

"event","today was ill.. went to school late. school wasn't that bad except brett is a fucking idiot and when he said he needed to talk to me during my bio class he was like he owes me money so my teacher was like is this going to become and issue and i was like nah is he just an idiot and it has to do what happened yesterday. so yesterday, brett n derek n levy got all bout it with us at candela practice. let me explain: being so kind brett let justin use his drumset that he never ever plasy or uses so  justin brought it to candela practice and so i could play at my house on my set cos its huge and has a big rack and all thsi shit so yestreday brett barged in and took it just bc justin was out of the band. they are emo bitchs.

after school i called joe blaze to help me transport my huge set to justins grandma's. we blazed a fat sack rolled with the dutchy flavor wrapped around it :)
that was chill bc we were maad high and telling eachother stories and shit, then miller came cos i was waiting at justins gma's i rolled another L, we saved for after practice, jason, justin, jess, emo matt, tompson, and laith then come, and we play for tomp laith n emo, we were playing mad good. then we went to the forrest and chilled there for like a good hour and blazed and did some vicodin :x
we blazed a blunt, and 2 more joints after that so we were all pretty fucked up. we go back into the house and play for another like 2 housr and yo the shit we made up was maad crazy.. new song called like tropical island and we perfected athena in retrospect and more then chemical reactions, we're recording tomorrow with the 4 track.

after band practice we went to wendys where emo matt got robbed of a dollar from some nigger that works there and he wouldnt shut up and then me and miller were dissing his fugee loving ass and he kept asking me for my vic and a cig and im like nah nigga no vic for u and u can haev my stog for 3 quarters and that nigga dddid it.

(stop doing drugs matt)you had the whole worl din front of u
as kevin said

candela is now a full band i guess, because justin was telling me that jason goodman (bassist from the dotted line) wants to jam out with us and we will see how that goes and another guitarist that used to play with the really beginning end of a decade (me eddie justin and matt) tim marcel, so we are now a 6 piece if those kids seem to work out and make us better then we already are.

i will have a full report on the band practice and how it goes tomorrow.
for now i say spring bring is going good.
people at guitarist center are so stupid.
i hate being in that place when they fuck stuff up cos i orderd a piece for my drums and they get the wrong shit.. meanwhile it took fucking 2 weeks to give me the wrong thing. so i decided to fucking play there drums mad loud and beat the fuck out of them :)

im going to go lay down or do something,.. possibly pass out.
wheres gabby! i need somebody to talk to and keep me awake :(

"event","i saw dave chappelle tonight. was really really funny. i went with viola, the 41, faraci, and laith. he seriuosly is the greatest nigger of aaaalll time.
i need to play really bad. people and shit around me have been getting me so frustrated lately.. i found myself buying a pack of ciggerettes tonight, and not because i went to see dave, because i needed them. i used to smoke stogs when i was frustrated and i havent bought a pack in months. so, frustrated as fuck i bought a pack tonight of camel izir stinger cocktail ciggerettes so atleast i can be casually pissed off.
i haven't smoked ganj all week so i am proud, ive been doing it for about 2 weeks now! last week i think i hit an L like once, but i dont consider it smoking as i used to, like evrey single day. i basically can prove to myself i can go on and off with pot as i like. its not something i need, its something i crave. sometimes i dont even like being high anymore - it ruins alot of things like hanging out w people and certain activities. and to all u pot heads who think u need to smoke before doing evreything - u are wrong. i laughed just as hard tonight at dave chappelle then if i was stoned, i just woul dhave laughed as hard yet killed like 1,000 more brain cells. i just wanna practice tomorrow or i will kill somebody. im tired and haev to take a drivers ed test tomorrow at 830 but whatever i get to miss like mad school. so bye. xoxo"

i somewhat quit ciggerettes, i bummed one off little kid today and i realized i haven't smoked one in about 4/5 days. thats pretty impressive considering i work w brett + 41 frank + brian who are the biggest chain smokers i know. they even offered me stogs but i just said nah. im glad im not as addicted. those things make me sick nowadays.. maybe its just my body telling me my lungs dont want more bad fucking chemicals from ciggerettes or maybe im just getting sick which could be a posibility. i dunno. whatever.

i hope to do something fun tomorrow night bc it is friday. maybe somebody will throw the ill party or something. who knows, i just like to get social on fridays and i get pissed if nothing goes on.

"event","ok last night was probably one of the funnest nights i have had this school year.
the day began with danielles birthday party @ her house. @ about 430 me and farhad arived at her house, with our gifts and watermelon blunt wraps. we chilled there for a couple of hours, there was mad people there, i knew most of the girls, but thats really it. i sort of got bored because it wasnt really my type of crowd, so i realized i neeeeeeded to guy buy a ticket to the cavein/piebald show. i called hegel and he said he wanted a ticket to, so he oliver and the 41 picked me up at danielles. so a blunt was pre-rolled for me of course, we smoked it, and then i called kirk. from this part on of the night it was getting better.
kirk was with ryan viola and tompson and they had eaten mad shrooms, like almost 3gs each.
ok so from then on we meet up with them, and me, hegel, and 41 all cop an eighth seperately.
tompson was tripping alittle, kirk wasnt feeling anything at all, and ryan was just feeling it. we then departed from the hollywood video parking lot to go get some food. mcdonalds. hegel ask's me to make him a shroom sandwhich, which i do. i take most of his shrooms + put them on his sandwhich. 41 is gangsta so he jus eats them straight up.. i eat 2 caps and a stem that kirk gave me as a present he said. hegel has tripped but on a low dosage, 41 has never. they both eat almost 3gs so im thinking theyre gonna be tripping in like an hour or two. ok so two hours later we end up at christina justice's pool house which is mad ill because its like a mini house, so its me oliver, tj, jony v, 41, barbie, christina, two other girls, and hegel. HEGEL was buggggging the fuck out, and it was THE funnyiest shit me and the other people have ever witnessed. it was single handedly the greatest thing in the entire world. hegel is hilarious when he is high but when he is on a psychedellic drug it makse him one million times funnyier. it was nonstop laughing. you had to be there to see it. ok so after like another 2 hours of smoking mad tree's, and laughing at hegel, me and 41 were tripping but def not as hard as jefff.. so 41 dumps about 1g of the shake left in his eight bag. i knew he was gonna fucking be balling in like an hour. i ate another pretty big cap that had golden streaks in it. so about 30 mins later kirk calls me and picks me up.. from this part on the night got even CRAZYier. when i get in the car, pink floyd was on.. perfect music for the experience..  and kirk was driving around old westbury (craaaazy place to trip) at about 2mph, which is the perfect speed to roll around on. the way we were moving with the music was crazy. i saw mad colors in the snow as well as around kirks interior of his car, everybody else was tripping also, so like 6 people were all tripping which i think is funny, ok so @ 12oclock kirk has to go to ambers house, which is by bretts, so we dont kno wwhere we should go so kirk is like dont worry about it.. and he drives to ambers. he parks the car and gives me and ryan the keys. hes like, i trust you guys with my car, and if you do drive, just don't crash it. so that was probably the greatest thing to hear while we were tripping, not hxc tho. ryan was driving while i skilled up the ill J and puffed it with tompson. we drove around albertson, and then @ the bunnyhill we stopped bc we saw shit onthe floor. it was a cd case. inside the case had like 2 BOB marly and the wailers cd's. we put one on. it made the setting even better bc we were blazing a J. how things were coming together were insane. i didnt have a bad though the whole time of the night, which made mine and our trips soooo much iller. so then i was driving for a like 15 mins and we met up with oliver hegle and 41 and 41 started tripping alot more bc of the shake he ingested earlierrrrr hegel was still buggin and it was hilarious. we smoked some bogies and then they bounced and so did we. @ 1, me ryan and tompson dropped kirks car off at his house, bc he told his mom he would drop it off. we then dropped it off, and a bunch of girls from herricks, josh zarabi, and acouple other cool cats from my school were driving around and saw us, the girls gave us a ride back to ambers and they were like we wanna do shrooms! and they knew all the people from our school and we knew people from there school + they were like your our new best friends! + other girly shit, etc etc. ok so then we chilled outside for alittle, let our trip go down, and then by 145 we fucking all got rides home and i got home and fucking chilled out then passed out. THE EEEEEEEEEEND

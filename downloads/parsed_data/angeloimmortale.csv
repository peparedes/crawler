so today i saw maggie and shane patrick.  i got lost going into albany med bc all the halls look the same. he is so CUTE! okay sometimes i think babies are really ugly but he is really cute. he has tiny little hands and ears and nose. and he makes squeak toy sounds. and he hardly cried at all when i was there. having a baby is scarey to me at this point i want to travel first and be with jonathan for a bit first, maybe have a career if i get mine started.  im too immature to take care of a baby and im scared to hold my bunnie let alone a baby. maggies let me hold him and i was so scared i was gonna break him bc he is so tiny. his head could fit in my hand.

anyways work work work work work this is tommorrow for me. i really need to start getting things together for my portfolio if i ever want to get a job.

plus it doesnt help i have to thin about wedding and the girls fighting over shoe color. im saying its gonna be the dress color i just have to call davids and see about what shoes can be dyed."

capstone is kicking my ass bc i refuse to do it and portfolio is kicking my ass bc there is SO much work to do. i need more hours in my days. i stayed un til 330 on thursday to get up at 7 to go to class. it was pretty much ridiculous.

Lisa nd i watched becoming Jane. it was sad ending. why do all creative people like that have shitty lives relationship wise??

Got some thank you notes i should have done a month ago done-ish. so there was sum productivity.

i was so slow at the internship today, but i didnt have any work and my boss wasnt there. i really dont like messing around for 8 hours when i have other things i could be doing.  plus i dont think i would be so slow if the computer wasnt a dinosaur.  it seriously takes 20 minutes to open a tif file in photoshop. i really want to rip my hair out. i was actually thinking of bringing in my lap top for photoshop work, BUT i cant do that bc the photoshop on their computer is cs and mine is cs2 so the files would not be compatable.  grrghness.  but i guess since im an intern i can be labeled as slow even those the dinosaur is really the one at fault.

"event","This semester is literally going to kick my ass!  I have some much work to do.  I have my portfolio, which I have lynne for.  Okay so today was our first portfolio prep class and I am so discouraged.  Why did i not go to saint rose???? Apparently (btw lynne used to work at saint rose so this makes any kind of sense)  saint rose students work all goes together. Like they design everything like a campaign so when it comes to putting it in a portfolio to show prespective employers it makes sense, unlike any of the stuff we did.  She spent the whole class showing portfolio pieces and all i could think of was wow none of my stuff comes close.  I guess that is what this class is for, but I can definitely see it being a ton huge amount of work that is going to kill me in the end.  I am so glad I started drinking coffee bc there is no way I am going to have time to sleep this semester with this class and capstone...

Capstone.  That is another class that will kick my ass.  My plan right now is to hopefully make it through with good pieces.  I have Lynne for that too.  She says that I am looking into the obvious for posters when I should look for symbolic meaning and that way the posters will turn out better.  Now seeing her students work I can see where she is coming from, but I dont know if I;m going to be able to do that.  I would like to be able to say I could, but I really have no idea.  I want this really strange effect I think... I want something shocking, but then something someone is going to stop and think about.  I just have no idea what it is...and time is beginning to crunch.

The Web.  Yeah I dropped my pop culture class for the web.  First off the pop culture class had a crazy teacher who wanted us to do a ton of work.  I;m not afraid of work but when the class is an elective and just so i can keep health insurance the answer is no.  I mean this class wouldnt have even helped me with my profession so i dropped it.  That and the teachers brain jumped all over the place that i could hardly follow.  I mean it may have been interesting, but it also could have been a waste of my time.  So anyway now I;m taking the web, which i knwo will have a lot of work in it too, but I think she said we will be learning html, and THAT will be useful in my career.  Plus we will be developing 3 websites, which if I do them right I can put in my porfolio. yay.  I really needed another class on dreamweaver and flash, and even though I am not supposed to taje this one bc i;m a graphic designer and not an info designer I think it will really benefit in the long run.

Topics in Graphic Design is my last class.  I guess we are going to come all topics, which will be a good review and I can learn other things.  Right now we are working with type.  Plus Jean is going to have us push out pieces, which can be put into a portfolio.

Anywasy I;m going to do some homework and hopefully finish in time to go out tonight. pz"

"event","so i cant wait until this week is over with. in about an hour ill be sitting in oral communications dreading that fact that by the end of class (ill probably be the last one) i have to give a speech on same sex marriage. im really worried bc i dont think my speech is persuasive enough, bc i dont like pushing my views on people like ever.  plus i am also worried bc it is such a controversial topic.  one, i hate giving speeches, but if i saw someone glaring at me id really freak out, like that time sophomore year when i was giving a speech on stem cell research and all i could think of was the 50 something guy in the back glaring at me, i got so nervous i horribly messed up and stumbled over every word. *sigh* i mean i know ive gotten better at giving speeches i jusst still hate being judged. PLUS on top of that my teacher wants me to pretend to be gay until the last part of the speech so i will appear to be more credible i dont understand taht but okay....

so tommorrow i ahve to have this animation done for class. apparently i actually have to have something done bc our teacher is weird and grades us on the process we make each week.  (i actually got a zero out of 100 one week bc my computer died, so i skipped class and never handed anything in). well i just found out about the zero yesturday and have been freaking out about it ever since, not about the zero but the getting something done for this week without mentally loosing my mind. im soo hopped up on coffee from staying up crazy late last night (btw thanks for the oh so lovely habit of coffee every morning helen) that im seriously vibrating. i have to keep drinking more or ill crash.

yeah the internship is sucky, but at least its not hannaford.  like they never give me any work and have actually started giving projects i have been working on to the other marketing intern. its like hello why do you have a graphic design intern if the marketing intern is doing all the design work??? w/e at least i get paid. i just hate being bored and feeling useless for hours on end while the guy next to me is all productive and stuff.  (btw the other intern is really awesome and nice so its not that i dont like him i just dont like the situation of how things are going down at that company) i wont get into details, but friends ive talked to say its pretty much crazy what is happening.

im soo nervous......i want to stop being this way. i guess typing it occupying my brain tho... trying to convince myself not to freak out with the crazy amount of energy surging through my veins.

so i have been very surprise my mother has not called me for about an entire week about wedding stuff, BUT then i realized she ahs been in disney world so that is probably the reason for her not calling.... its so weird i usually dread her calls bc they take away from homework time now im wondering where they are.

so jonathan is the best when i start freaking out. i dont think i know of any other person who can deal with me in those situations. last night i was pretty much on the verge of tears bc i didnt think i could get everything done.

:) jeff wants me to help him design a website over break. im excited. i really enjoy web stuff and flash, i miss is actually. the only thing ive been doing in flash now is drawing. i dont really enjoy illustrative work im more designer oriented. i mean i like to draw but i like organizing better. idk what im saying i think im babbling.  i hate graphic design, in the fact that the jobs i am given at my internship are incredably boring, but i liked it at the other internship so maybe its just this place? idk i think i like more web stuff.  if i get a job around here next semester im going to take classes after work in web design maybe... it interests me and ive only had one class on it.  plus maybe the technical part of my brain will come out of hidding and ill be able to reconnect with my nonartsy half.  bc seriously i think the art part of my brain has taken over and made me seemingly insane to anyone who doesnt know me.

yeah so over break, which thank god happens in like 2 weeks, i have to start my capstone projects (no idea what they are since i cant design a website bc its low hanging fruit), get wedding stuff together and book people, and move my shit into jonathans appartment. i mean he told me not to, but i need more clothes here its not a question. i am seriously reduced to stealing his socks bc the sock gnome eats them out of the dryer or something.

well im gonna go get shit together and maybe practice my speech one more time."

so today i went to edge fest with lisa. it was interesting, sort of a let down from warp tour bc it was mostly hippies on the grass even tho there were no hippies but there was alot of pot.  lots of loud music some eccentric musicians an over all good time. it was just us girls bc the boys decided to be boring this weekend and do other things. i saw a few people i knew/used to know there. interesting...

last night was celebrate bethany night bc her birthday was in the middle of the week. i was the youngest in this crowd and it was kinda weird when everyone had a drink and i didnt. idk how people are and i didnt wanna get anyone illegal so yeah. but there was mini golf and smores so good good.  i saw someone i havent seen in a few years too so that was interesting.

so i work tommorrow. not too exciting. i need to find time ti take photos and put together my portfolio and it doesnt seem to be working. i did my outline for the speech so not i just have to do all my other homework. i think i'll do all the reading shit tonight so i dont have to do it during the week and cram it... anyways i really need to get off lj and work, also i need to fold clothes, the appartment was cleaning due to the g parents coming tonight so i really should get going pz"

"event","i think i may actually die from over stress this semester. as if the capstone was not enough to freak out about that art history class i am taking for honors well she wants me to do a side project (thus the honors).  it either has to be a paper and 15 min presentation on somehting idk what maybe like a specific movement or something i know it has to be more than that... or she suggested an art exhibition or something.  she said something about an online book on a subject like an artist working around albany in a certain style that is depicted in the book, but the thing was she wants me to have the physical objects and not just picures. i do not know how that is possible so i am a little confused there. i think it is just like capstone except that fact that i only have a semester to do it.  idk this is crazy i dont know how i am going to get everything done and still do this honors thing. i actually considered quitting it but ive done so much already to quit in my last year would be like pointless or something... 

plus i applied for this paid internship.  i didnt really expect anything of it, but i was contacted for an interview, which means i have ot prep my portfolio which needs a crazy amount of work done to it.  i told her the times i could meet saying that next wednesday not this coming one would be preferable and friday afternoons. so i really hope that its next wednesday and not some crazy time like next friday. i really dont expect to get it, but if i did that would be an even crazier load to have plus this honors thing. i think i might cop out and do that paper and presentation.  i mean i really really hate speeches with a passion.  taking this public speeching class is literally killing me inside so this kind of shows how desparate i am. i thought the online book thing was a good idea but i dont know where she was going with that seeing as she was like not just pictures and an exhibition seems to be a little too much for me to handle right now plus hannaford equals ahhh freak out time.

*sigh* where do people find the time to get drunk and party in college? bc i cant even find the time to fit all my class work in.  i actually haev work in a few minutes (cashier= yay no stress of managing people). i also have ot call my mother about money issues... should be fun fun...:( well i really have to go just getting that out there, maybe now i can breathe a little."

"event","so i have wanted to go to warp tour ever since 10th grade and this year i finally got to go!!!  it was pretty amazing.  altho it was crazy hot and food/drink was really expensive.  plus for some odd reason they wouldnt let u have a cap on water bottles so they would take them off be4 giving them to you. what is that?!  i mean i think it would hurt way more it get hit by a whole bottle than a cap. but w/e.

anyways i realized that i really havent kept up with any of the bands there except for the incrediably awesome the spill canvas. which by i met at a signing and got their autos on a cd!!! yay! plus we stayed just to see them play and me and jonthan were liek 3 feet from them.  and i really dont like crowd surfers. maybe its bc im small but for some reason they always fall on me... at least this time jonathan was there to protect me from getting broke.  i also saw flogging molly, the starting line, coheed and cambria, NFG, throw down, boys like girls and a couple other really bad screaming bands. erik met flogging molly and got stuffins signed. it was pretty cool.  

so when the spill canvas goes on tour in the fall we want to go see them even if we ahve to drive like 3 hours.. this time we have to stay over tho bc it sucked trying to stay awake on the drive back.  we didnt get home until 3.  and the whole way back i was soo sick, we even stopped at a rest place so i could throw up (so not fun. plus if we do go to see them in the fall its in new jersey. and the coastline (at least on the cape if its not snowing) is pretty in the fall.

eeeeeee! TSC!!!

in unsexy news my computer is dying.  apparently it needs a new hard drive. so i have to save everything off this computer and then ship it to god knows where to be fixed, in hopefully 5 to 7 business days. it BETTER come back be4 school starts or there will be some issues.

tuesday i also saw joe. we drove around and ended up in washington park feeding the birds and squirrels french fries. i really hope that that is not bad for them...

wednesday erik lisa jonathan and i went to grafton. we had a bbq and went swimming and played frisbee. then we went to dinner at the outback with my dad and grandma. and ended up at the drive in movies.  we saw ratatoille and liscence to wed. the first one was good but i hate movies like the second one. i really cant stand movies about couples fighting all the time and the guy getting screamed at for the whole movie. anyways on the way home a cup of pepsi spilled all over the floor of eriks car ( i hope hes not too mad) and jonathan had the hiccups so bad it was crazy. 

so today we went to the track. i guess some good bets and won us like 26 dollars, unfrotunely in the end we ended up -30. but that wasnt too bad.  we went to a hibachi for dinner and i paid. then we went to walk in saratoga and got gelato, which was yummy.  on the way home jonathan baught his first alcohols and drank one.

so I wrote up a list of things i want to get done this summer. i even asked my teacher for extra action script work. the thing is without a project its hard to get into actionscript. like i need to know what it is i want to do in order to do it. i was thinking about designing a portfolio website for myself using flash. the thing is i i no creative ideas. that and i need to know what kind of portfolio stuff im going to be putting on it in order to know how the feel of the site should be.  anyways i really am not sticking to my list and i keep losing it. grrgh.

so i am having a living situation dilema.  half my stuff is here and hald my stuff it at my dads house.  i am not comfortable being in either place bc i feel like im missing something which i am.  that and even if i were to take my stuff and bring it here there is really no room at all.  the dresser is like not even big enuff for a 1/4 of my clothes... i need a bigger dresser. that and what do i do with all my girly things?? i still want them but they dont really go with the guy stuff jonathan has. :(

work at hannaford is ick... i have a coverletter and a resume all lined up for a state like jobish thing, which they say i can have during school. it seems just about perfect even tho it really doenst have too much to do with my major.  thus the probability of me getting it seems pretty small.  but at least im trying to distance myself from the bitch place of doom.

we did some slots even tho it is illegal seeing as neither of us are 21. i got a tan and we sat by the pool lots. we also went shopping in the outlets. apparently chineses in las vegas do not give duck sauce with their foods. wtf?!

my internship is almost over. im gonna kinda miss it but i wont miss having to work 2 jobs and not get paid for the one stealing all the time...

well erik jhust ran up 5 flights of stairs so i have to go ..pz"

the bad part about living in colonie and going to school here and doing everything here is that the same annoying people seem to just keep popping up. i hate this place and really would consider moving after college. i want a fresh new area with people i dont know so i cant avoid them at all costs...

so i talked to my internship person and she said i could start a week early, so that is good. except i dont think the other intern will be there until the following week. its kinda scarey, but im excited. im scared i would be really good at whatever it is im doing and i really hope i dont get one of those artist blocks where all my ideas just arent around. 

seeing as my internship is not paid i will still be working at hannaford. i have to give them new availablitity which is mostly nights...ick 

at least the second half of the summer i can be bored. its not like i can get another job. i want to spend most of it going over computer technical stuff for next year... idk... who knows if i will even do that... ahh i have to call about something ...pz"

I was in a really bad mood today, only when i got to work to have everyone yell at me. first they tell me to go on register and then when i try to they say its not the right one, btw i had just gotten there and they didnt have me even on a register.   I REALLY FUCKIN HATE THAT SHIT HOLE! i am seriously thinking about another job. i cant stand that thought of working there another year.  i really wish i had gotten an internship that paid and that i could work 40 hours a week at all summer. that would have been great, but no i dont get that kind of break... grrrgh. btw customers are ass holes and then right after they try to be all nice cants they see im doing all i can not to punch them in there fucking stupid ass face... bad night for people... what the hell are they doing out of there houses anyway??? i got stuck in my driveway and they want to drive all the way to the store grocery store in a blizzard. dumb ass.

im pretty sad that jonathan has to work tommorrow but i know he needs the money... i just hate people. ever since i hit college i have no really good friends and so when he works i just sit home and do nothing.  i am one of those girls that only has their boyfriend to have fun with... sad but true. i think im gonna chop out some people i never see from my phone. oo and at least i got 2 presents outta it... :(

"event","today was a suck... well idk

we had to go to the paper mill today for a tour for dig prod II, and this guy who took us walked aroudn the mill and talked for like 3 hours about it...it went right over my head. i got some stuff but all the chemicals and the testing is beyond me. oo i found my way to the mill and then i had to drive back to albany on 787 and i got confused...luckily i called helen ad she ended up being right behind my car so i was like ooo motion when i should take a turn. so i found my way back and it was exciting!

then we critqued and for some reason i got out words for once in my life. ive never been good at crits and i always never say anything but i did this time it was pretty cool , so i was feeling all confident and happy and stuff and then i had to go to work...

work really sucked. i was a cashier all day surprise surprise. im never a shiftleader anymore. but i wasnt soo upset until i went to look at the schedule and im a cashier all week this week.... it really sucks the onyl time im not one is for the meeting... i wonder if this has anything to do with me yelling at that customer but i didnt even yell i just responded.. she was like what is wrong with you how can u not remember the money i gave u ( i had to have my drawer counted) and i was like im sorry but i do this all day and i really dont remember. i dont think that was bad seeing as i didnt even yell either.  

anyways my car cant go above 50 without shaking really badly and im hoping its just snow in the tires like the mechanic says bc if its not im gonna have to pay 300 dollars to have my tires aligned or something like that... plus i had a huge headache at work and was feeling really sick. my brother let me go home 8 mins early and it was lucky bc right when i got home i ran to the bathroom and got really sick...idk if it was the fumes from the paper mill or just the fact that i let stupid work get to me... i wish i didnt let it get to me but it does, i almost cried when i got all cashier hours. it wouldnt be so bad except for the fact they make me do shiftleader stuff when im on register. FUCK them. that is seriously it... im gonna go in and be all sweet and what the fuck ever and be like kim can i put you on my resume as a reference, and then im just gonna go find another job... im so sick of that place. if they do that again next week im just gonna be like why? and see what they say."

so anyways apparently the new sl jeff was friends with brandon and his gf. weird... and i found out that he is supposedly smart too, chris had me beliving otherwise. i thought he was like relaly dumb or something idk. im gonan find out tho next time i see this kid. im gonna be like do you know... and if not that is a crazy coincidence.

yeah i really should be displacing my logo that i should probably bring into illustrator and do right. ahh my brain is going to explode. 

i just finished my taxes (what fun!) and the fed gov owes me and so does the state (for once). okay who designed those horrible start tax forms??? they are bright pink and after staring at them for a while your eyes go all crazy. and did anyone tell them that shades of red probably dont keep people in the calmest of moods? just some things to think about...

so i still have to put in my vaca weeks for hannaford. kim told me i have to take a vacation this year...grrgh...hmmm i think im gonna put in the week i go with G to vagas...if im still allowed to go, i should find that one out and then idk weirdness. well i was thinking if i have an internship maybe i could take a week randomly...who knows yet anyways i get 2 and thats a paid 28 hrs for each. yayness. its like free money

"event","todays class sucked. i had a feeling too. you know next time i have a feeling i should just stay in bed bc something bad always happens.  i wish i could just quit on life and just lay around and not think or do anything.

apparently all my ideas for the screen print tshirt suck. in critique they didnt even say anything about anything. except dont have the drips bc its too literal and then the whole class went off on a tangent about emo music and then the teacher started talking about spin art. so basically i have to start over and have no idea what im supposed to be doing. 

i have decided i hate that teacher, she just is not very good. unless this is some stupid push you to the limits thing and see how far you go until you jump off the edge, but i dont really think she is smart enough for that for some reason. im a cenimeter close to saying fuck it ill do what i want. well that is basically what im going to do what i want seeing as i have no other direction to go in...

graphic design was probably a bad idea. i keeping thinking that now. it feels liek a clique and god knows i never fit into those. and it feels like im not even supposed to be in this feild. i cant even say anything either. i cant talk to my dad and be like opps maybe i chose the wrong major bc hes all into money and will be like well make it the right major bc apparently when im 21 in october my mother doesnt have to help with tuition legally and my dad will try to pay it for me, i told him about heavy interest loans that i could take out but he thinks there is ""another"" way.... in my life yeah right. my artwork is not good enough i know that i have accepted it thinking well alot of people are not good and still have jobs, so so what if im just another crap art maker. but everyone i know like my dad and jonathan are like your work is good. well apparently not good enough. but i dont thiknk im good at anything else either.  i really dont wnat ot work at hannafords (or a job like that forever) these facts are scaring me, bc they are fast appoarching.  i dont know what to do...

class was cut short today. the ""field trip"" to 'wicked smart', which is some screen printing shop on broadway, in menands.  we got there late bc we got stuck behind a traffic light and got lost (we didnt have directions). i called g and he told us how to get there, but was mad bc that caused himt o be late to class :( it was okay. the graphic artist guy was like you have to be socail to have this job and i was like well its like the last nail in the coffin then huh? im not a social butterfly. 

wtf im soo angry and sad. idk how to be. i feel like im in a room without windows or doors and the ceiling is falling in on my head and there is no way out.  i dont know what to do... and i only have a year and this semester left. i should have went to school to be an accountant or something boring so i could lead a boring life and die boring.

i also keep thinking about life too. artists are cliquey and im not. im nothing like any one of them that i have met. the only thing the puts me into the category is that i feel like im a little insane or some kind of mentally unstable person, but not in the wya you are supposed to be.

i have work today i was supposed to go in at 2 but i changed it to 430 but class got out early, im supposed to be working on my shirt but i have no idea what to do. i think i will do that until 430, even tho i could go in to work i dont wnat to bc i need time to do this and it was either do it there or at home but seeing as i was about to cry my eyes out i went home. 

i hate how these things effect me so much. which is another thing i used to be able to take critiques and now i cant.  its not hard when they are good reasoning but this kind was not good enough for me. it was just i dont like this i dont like that, u dont seem to not even like or know about this band, wtf ive known of them for almost 4 years now. but yeah i dont know eanything about their music. 

i just want a hug. i also just want to quit at life."

"event","as i get older, ive been noticing that my dad has been getting grumpier. today is the first time i actually considered moving out. i feel like im being emotionally abused.  i think it may be bc he doesnt want me and my brother to move out bc he's going to be lonely and so he acts out at us with anger instead of being nice to us. thuse we dont want to be anywhere around the house when he is here. in that case he is getting what he doesnt want...

then there is another part of me that thinks what if im making up this psycho babble and he is really just a grouchy person? how could anyone make their own child feel like garbage? i prefer to think that the first idea is the right one.

either way i always feel like shit when im in this house... when im  out of school im gone... that is my decision. i feel torn between these 2 ideas and i think i have to do what is good for me. and i cant leave until im out of school bc my father has threatened financially.. and i cant even think about paying for school right now by myself. my mother is no help when it comes to that and i loose so much right now bc she still legally declares me as a dependant.

i was actually about to think about what things i should take with me... i dont have much so it shouldnt be too hard... i never wanted to be the girl that moved in with her boyfriend after college but i think im going to be.. i always thought i would live with my best friend or myself. i cant financially support myself, and i dont have a best friend, so this is my choice. besides when i hide away at jonathan's appartment im always so happy and i feel safe. i should have just stayed there until work happened.

anyway... i think im  going to start cleaning... there is nothing else to do but study until i go to work... i really dont feel like leaving my room."

ALL OF THEM?! yeah i really dont htink so... and this is why i dont take this class seriosuly. he can say im wrong all he wants but im gonna get this stupid presentation over with and he can read my paper and look up the references and if its wrong well so what this course isnt in my major and its just stupid. i think this guy is making me hate the way afircans think.... or at least the way he thinks. he told me that i was wrong the other day for thinking a multiparty system was a good idea. he said the best political systems were one party... then he went on to say that the one party had sections which you could vote on that person... i was like then its a multiparty system mascarading as a one party... grrgh this guy doenst make sense to me at all..... yeah sorry for the ramble.... well i should be saying sorry my poor laptop for pounding on your keys... 

yeah lately ive been soo depressed. it comes in stages tho. i dont think i handle people well at all. its just certain people too.. you know how when u really want to make someone like you you try too hard and its not good??? well i jusst never say anything and it looks like i hate them bc im afraid what im gonna say will be wrong... its always like that with jonahtans parents...lol so evilness prevailed and i gave his dad the red sox thing and he was like oh god... bc obviously hes a yankee fan (seriously tho i really dont like baseball that much they are all the same to me... except for johnny damon who is hot so there) anyways then i gave him like yankee and ny giants stuff and he was like good no red sox.... but on another note i like the giants. i like football. its way more exciting than baseball and i like all the smashing of other players.... maybe the would dbe called tackling. but yeah i like it i would totally not mind being one of those wives that has a party and the guys can go watch their footballs.... and i could make food....tho the thing is i would wanna watch the footballl too.... ick im one of those girlfriends....i always thought liking sports was unattractive and not girlly enuff.  i got caren jewelry i think she liked it. i felt bad bc her gift was smaller but it was the same amt of money for both tho..

yeah so i was going to say how sad ive been lately but im relaly not in that mood right now.... so its hard to type about.... oh well... yeah its really random tho bc ill randomly get really sad for no reaason really.... well there is a really big reason but i really dont feel like pouring my soul out onto a computer screen....so :p

recent events are making me think i have to re-evaluate the people i hang around. to me it seems like i just let people treat me like dirt. i am kind of sick of it. i need to start being my own person, w/e that means. i just want to stop letting people walk on me and start saying things out... i say that now and like tommorrow ill be back to it again.. i think that is gonna be my goal tho. how am i ever going to defend my artwork and state my opinions if i dont have any confidence. the other day i started it a little and the person i was standing up to got all arguementative. hey its not my fault she was being all bitchy... i just dont want to stand there and take bitchy comments i dont deserve. i mean if i deserve a bitchy comment i will take it.

there are a lot of meetings tommorrow. a designer is coming in and also jean said that Italy/Greece thing was tommorrow too. even tho i probably cant go i was thinking of checking that out... david and matt want us to go see the designer talk too and it overlaps so idk...we are supposed to present out website ideas tommorrow. mine isnt the best... its going to be on china displaying itself as a strong wealthy power to the western culture, even tho in that time period it was crumbling all to crap, but seeing as im Tzu hsi i probably would think it was a good site. i have some ideas, btu i dont feel prepared and.....

I WANT TO THROW MY PRINTER OUT THE WINDOW! there is no reason why is should refuse to work... grrgh

plus even tho i love g he is really distracting.. i feel like i enver get anything done around him... *saddness*

i got to sleep or something pz"

"event","is almost 8 o'clock....

mondays are SUPPOSED to be my productive night and instead i lay around watching desparate house wives on line and doing anything but homework.

i feel soo anxious lately and sick to my stomach... school is stressing me out.. jonathan and i want to join a cult...but i know in a long run that wouldnt be soo good

Tzu hsi is okay but im having trouble on what her website should be about...seeing as im her (well in real life if i were her) i would make the whole entire site about me... seeing as she was so selfish and everything... i mean I was hee hee... i have to run it past my professor and see what he thinks.. its soo weird calling matt and david professors lol

Maira Kalman isnt coming along too well either.. i think i should email jean and see if she has any articles.. after i throughly search the web for some... this is suckness. i really need to go buy her book...

Ghana isnt coming along to well either. i talked with this guy in my class today and he said not too worry about it too much and that professor znfdjkherlin makes it out harder than it is. i told him i was having issues finding up to date books and he was like just write stuff down... so maybe ...idk there are still not many books on africa and the ones that are are madd old.... i mean i cant use a book for reference that still believes Nkrumah is in power! 
in other news that class almost made me throw up today.. we watched a traditional african exorcism and the killing of the goat and all its blood made me queesy... that and the whole bathing in it and the spitting..... :/


hmm i think im gonna go try and start something maybe watch how i met your mother too if its on tonight...

"event","im soo stressed out... like today i really was freaking out. i havbe soo much work... for me its toward the end of the semester. i have 4 weeks left! yeah sage college gets out crazy early. anyways i have a presentation i havent eveen started, my huge ass ghana paper, and then my website ( i have to research tzu hsi and chinese art during her time period), then i have my dig prod homework and printmaking and other stuff plus work...

i guess what really makes me mad is my inability to say no. helen was liek dude i dont get this give me ur eps files and ill just put them in my prject. im like dude do u know how long it took me to figure that damn thing out?! it took 5 hours (a worknight til 3 am when i had to get up at 7) and about 15 hours this week and i still havent gotten them right, it gets me soo mad that i just gave them to her too...its weird tho in art bc i know im gonna have to ask her alot how to do things in other classes... it just makes me mad... all that time

yeah so i was stressed all day and i go to the mac lab to print out my project wirelessly and guess what? the damn internet in the GDB DIED!! that is when i freakin flipped. i shoved all my shit into my bag and stomped out! SAGE WIRELESS IS SHITTY! they really need to find a way to make it better bc it never works wtf? BTW did i mention i hate sage?? apparently, as i am learning in my graphic design class many relaly good designers are teaching at some suny schools i was looking at to begin with *coff* purchase *coff* why didnt i go there?? there are tons of crazy stuff they are doing according to one of my teaches.... also there are alot of relly good art schools in california...i feel like i missed big opportunities and its all bc of money

speaking of money my school is havigna trip to greece and italy this summer... i really wanted to go... but its $2700. i could never afford that....

i hate money

"event","im soo tired of school and responsibilty.i want to run away to the middle of nowhere and just do artwork and take daily walks into wilderness, bt lets face it im gonna be stuck in a job probably in a place around albany in an office forever working on graphic design.... thats not so bad but i feel like im being sucked into this life and im getting clostraphobic. i want to travel and see the world and everything. i keep thinking alot lately about dying, which is kinda morbid but i dont want to die and not have done anything. i want to experience everything. i keep questioning my major and getting really gittery about everything. im scared about the future and working. but i really hate this part of my life too. i feel like im not outputing anything good or useful, especailly in my artwork. it seems stuck into where it is and forced. i know im not as good as the other designers in my class. it really bothers me that jonathan keeps saying out im going to work for the state and never move out of albany. that really bothers me bc i dont want to be stuck with that either. okay if i find a job i LIKE in albany fine but if i dont im not going to just sit here. hes all one track here and i just need to knwo that he isnt or im going to have to make big decisions. its not like i absolutely dont wnat to stay in albany its just i dont want someone telling me oh this is what im doing and hey u cant find a job around here. i still want to have a choice and i dont want hard ones. i also dont want to be the kind of person that puts a job over people either. i went to see the advisor lady for jobs/internships yestiurday. i have an appointment next tuesday....well i really have to look over my history of graphic design reading before class..."

work was crazy today. the power went out and everything was on batteries and dying. like 5 registers went out and then bam we got him with 15 million people well not that much but is sure seemed like it. the whole store came to the front end at once and only a few registers were open, also the belts werent working... anywyas i just felt like dying when i got out bc i was soo tired..

"event","i think i mistakenly offended one of my teachers today.. i address an email as hey and forgot to put a coma so i guess it kinda sounded evil and she emailled me back yelling at me about it how it was disrespectful so i in turn emailed her back syaing i didnt mean to and i was really sorry and all this stuff. jess says i should ahve responded by saying hey is a 21st century term and she should get into it and then if i said hey yo bitch wouldva meant disrespect but ehh i am too scared that she is gonna hate me for the rest of the semester anywyas... i guess she is having alot of trouble with students and complains to the dean and stuff so maybe she is stressed out or something... 

ahh so much homework i have to carve out a block of wood which equals not fun i think i wanna carve a snow fairy or something... anyways then there is african regimes papers and interactive homework evilness. i have to pick a topic im interested in so i can do i website on it... this is not gonna be fun. i was thinking of doing gothic subculture bc nadya said i should and i cant think of one thing i am interesting in. im interested in art, movies, tv and most other things that would not make a good website... jess says i should do one on bunnies but idk that will be one topic i have to choose 3!!! im obsessed with buffy but then again im a closet buffy fan so that is out of the question i mean i already get weird looks for taking pictures of gothic girls in cemetaries. wtf?! i thought art students were supposed to be open minded and instead i go to school with the most close minded ones.... either that or its the graphic designers click that i am not cool enuff to be into... *sigh* i feel jipped (sp?) at this art school

btw fuck digital production i cant think of a good idea for that damn card and its due friday... all i got is that scarey little girl.... what am i gonna do??? i want something cute and i cant paint. damn it all to hell...

ps student govt sucks and i guess me or jess has to go to their meeting tommorrow i think it is. what am i supposed to do sit there and be like um im an idiot and have no idea what we are doing in honors club bc no one is doing anything... we have ideas but no one is doing anything still..."

"event","i must say designing websites is very evil. i think the most struggling for me comes with the whole trying to figure out how technically everything woeks. i found out some things which made me very happy even tho in the grand scheme of web design they are prbably very small things. trying to be creative when u dont know anything technical is also relaly hard. i wanted to have like organic vines creeping into my website and pulling at the words and stuff but i dont think i can do that seeing as i have no idea technically where id even start.

today i woke up to a million calls from hannaofrd none of which i returned. i am becoming a horrible employee, well not horrible i always go in for my shifts and do my job its just i found coming in whenever they want me to is stupid bc it gets u no where. plus helen called about the meeting for the phoenix which i didnt go to. first of all i didnt know there was a meeting bc no one told me. whenever the meeting was i was supposed to take bob to and bob never emailed me so i just forgot about it. plus i dont enjoy driving into albany unless i have to bc even tho it takes the normal person like 10 minutes to get there for some reason it takes me 20. i have no idea how seeing as chris who lives in castleton can get there in 20 and im pretty sure that is farther than colonie. evilness.

so i spent the day with g. we went to paneras for lunch and then to xgates for a movie. employee of the month with dane cook actually. this film tres amused me. except for the whole jessica simpson thing it was good. tonight we are just gonna hang around gs and make lasagnea and krispies. eee and do hommeworks and watch tv. yummy..."

last night ek and lisa and me and g went to the double m??? haunted hayride thingie. i didnt like it there that much. idk why bc i dont knwo what i was expecting but it just seemed too commerical there that it should have. maybe im just crazy but i remember back in the day when a haunted hayride was like a hayride thro the woods with maybe like one monster running after the wagon... idk maybe im just old... yeah but i had a candy apple and okay i think freddie was maybe the scariest monster there... only bc of the strobe lights and his creepy fingers. i was amused. be4 we even got in tho there was a fight in the parking lot bc a drunk guy didnt wnana stop smoking be4 he went into the gates even tho they told him like 15 times. what is wrong with smokers??? okay he had his little niece and nephew with him and they had to leave bc he didnt wanna put out his stupid cigarette i mean okay i see u are addicted but dont ruin it for people u supposedly care about. fuckheads! i wanna go do a corn maze. todya would have been perfect bc its warm and stuff but everyone had to work... evilness. i really wanna throw a party for halloween or go to one or something but i relaly dont like anyone so i doubt there would be anyone to invite that would be fun and not in a drunk drugged up sorta way... idc if im a loser but i think that best party is the one with like music and movies and just hanging out. and of course there has to be alot of cheesey stuff like candy and crazy fake spiders and stuff.

school gets me really mad. like im in this class and i dont know how to do anythng and they want me to design this website and im just so lost. im doing the best i can with what i can figure out and its just really getting to the point wehre i want to scream. also btw i hate when i ask people how to do something and they dont really care to tell u bc they are too involved with themselves to help. yeah, its not that i have ask but something today along those lines relaly pissed me off...

*sigh* i really should go check on the laundry or something... im hungry too then i can get back to this horrible project."

"event","okay my teacher cancelled class and she supposedly posted questions on blackboard for us to answer except the thing is i went there and there were no questions i think i mmay be looking in the wrong spot but she told us to go to discussion bored. grrgh!! yeah that class scares me bc i have no idea when she wants us to know for the test. in the art histories we just had to memorize paintings and dates i have no idea what she wants us to know in this class. and although i would love to study all the lecture slides im pretty sure my brain would end up dribbling out my ear...*sigh*

i went to my meetings for yesturday, AIGA and the phoenix. i like how aiga is a really structured meeting but it kinda scares me bc its too structured. they are planning lots of trips and i might go on a few but not a ton of them bc most of them are during school. i think i will go on the one to NYC in februrary just bc nyc is cool and i think they were gonna set up some tour of a graphic design building or something idk.  but it sucked too bc i missed me meeting last week and everyone had chosen groups to design stuff so i was all left out when tehy were like does anyone have ideas and then they just chose a group... :( but hah!!! i joined aiga and not alot of members can say that. too cheap to pay the moneys i see so that is one up for me! the phoenix was a more relaxed meeting but still somewhat structured. i think im doing layout and maaybe some writing. im not the best writer in the world but i bet the paper is really gonna end up needed that bc most of the people who showed up were more for the arts than the writings. i dont think i could do reporting but anything else is okay maybe some research if im not dying in other classes.  about the honors club to which i hate right now maybe ill give this dance thing a chance but on no circumstances am i gonna do alot for it bc i think the whole concept is stupid and not thought out. this is supposed to be  aclub anyone can be in not just drag queen freaks so altho its an okay theme SOme people need to start thinking about the big picture and not just themselves and their horniness. (btw these some people are really starting ot piss me off). about aside from the it coould be a good idea i just wish it was more be4 halloween than after bc i think that would up the people ratio. i mean im not going to go bc i dont like that kinda thing but i may help a little maybe...(not committing myself is the best way to go in this situation)

i really need to make new friends im really getting tired with the acquintances i know at sage. its not that they arent interesting its just that its not really on my level of how i think about things. like right now i think about money and bills and what im going to be doing when i get outta school and am trying my best to prepare for it and i feel like most people i know arent at that stage yet.  i mean i can have fun at times but there are just times you need to step away from the fun and get serious. *sigh* i really miss hanging out with nadya. she asked me to go to connecticut this weekend but i really cant go. i have soo much work and other obligations. christine is coming back this weekend and i said i go out to dinner with kevin her and g, so i ahev to do that plus i need to do something either fun or productive on my saturday off from the hannaoford.

brrr its relaly freezing in this house i think i will go put on a sweater.

ps. what is wrong with libraries in that they dont have many books on africa??? maybe there really is a discriminations still... all i could find in the one near my house was childrens books and one adult book that is 11 years old.."

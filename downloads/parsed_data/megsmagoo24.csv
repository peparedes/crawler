"event","I just dont understand anymore.  I thought i was over it, and then Boom, it just hit me in the face again.  I spent all day yesterday thinking about it, and then spent all night crying about it.  It never did bother me that he had been with someone else, and had loved someone else before me, but i guess it never really hit me untill that night at mikes house.  I knew i should have never went there to begin with.  Now everything that happened there, and everything that i heard that night is driving me insane.  Maybe its just that i dont know what they were talking about and i of course then assume the worst.  Or maybe its that fact that he couldnt talk about it in front of me, which makes me assume the worst even more.  I wish i could write more, because i have so much emotion bottled up inside of me write now, and writing it down really does help, but i have to get to class, so i will be writing again soon."

"event","I think ive determinded that its like national guys are assholes week.  It just seems that all my friends, along with myself are having a horrible time in the guy department.  One of my good friend's boyfriend just broke up with her, after almost a year and a half.  Shes not taking it too well either, and i feel so bad for her.  I wish i could do something to cheer her up, but right now i think the best thing for her, is to be surrounded by people who care about her, and just cry about it.  It really does seem to help.  Then theres retta, my best friend.  Im sry hun i hate the air force too.  THey take all the good ones dont they.  I wish he could come home for prom too, and i wish he would give you a straight answer about how he feels for you.  Then theres me, and my pathetic love life.  Its been a long time since i had a boyfriend, and i think it was because i was so afraid of getting hurt again, the way my ex hurt me.  But i finally opened up my heart again and let someone in, just to get hurt even worse this time.  I wish he could just see the way hes making me feel.  I mean he tells me that hes miserable, but he wont make up his mind, and to tell u the truth i dont really think i can be friends with him, and least not right now.  And i thought i was so set on a prom date 2.  Now im back to the beginning, dateless and dressless.  And is it bad that i still wanna go with him, even after what he did to me?  And then theres ali.  What to say about her.  Im jealous, because shes got the perfect boyfriend.  Well i guess hes not perfect, but i want what they have.  Anyways, i really wish my friends would stop trying to find me a prom date too.  I know that they are just trying to help, but really they are making things worse.  

On a happier note, in seven days i will be 18!  and i cannot wait for my party that the people i work with are giving me.  7 days till my birthday, and 3 months and 7 days to find a date to prom."

"event","So I really dont know how to explain how i feel.  I like him so much and everytime im with him i like him even more.  But he hurt me.  I am mad at him but i cant seem to stay mad.  I dont really know if this makes any sense.  I want to hate him but i dont.  He tells me that i make him happy, and that he likes me too but he doesnt wanna get involved with someone who is going away to school.  But really that is 6 months away.  I dont know im so confused.  I know im going away but its not like im going that far away, its only an hour.  I just think he should have said something earlier, before we did get sort of involved.  And he says he just wants to be friends, because he doesnt wanna get hurt, or hurt anyone else, but he already is hurting me.  And i really dont know if us being friends is going to work.  At least not right now.  I mean I want more then that from him.  I wanna be around him becuas he makes me smile and he makes me laugh.  I wish he would decide whats going on between us because there is no way i am doing the whole ""friends with benefits"" thing, becuase someone always gets hurt, and it will prolly be me.  I just wish I could stop likeing him because then this pain I have in my stomach would go away.  Then maybe we could just be friends, but life doesnt work that way.  It just seems that everything is going wrong in my life right now.  I thought everything was going well.  I just went on vacation to Florida, Disney World, the happiest place on earth, and had so much fun.  Now that person I like who i though i was getting closer too, has just, well more or less broken my heart.  Not to mention that im grounded for who knows how long and now it just doesnt seem worth it.  I just wanna stop crying and feel happy again.
      At least one thing in my life is going right.  I finally got my acceptance letter to Geneseo, the one i had been stressing over."

"event","Saw Of Montreal at the Metro on Friday.  I ended up leaving a couple songs after kevin Barnes' third costume change.  The mini-theatre type thing, while being better than the slow-motion shit I saw last time, left me feeling impatient and tired.  It didn't help that the keyboardist chick played the first 8 measures of Bach's well-tempered clavier book 1 part 1 on loop for like 8 minutes.  I mean, I like the song (love it, really) but it's one of the few times I've come that close to feeling muisically offended at a rock show.  I don't know why...

As always (or so it seems) I'm behind in the Internet times.  I didn't know about cuteoverload dot com until this weekend.  Do you know how long <a href=""http://mfrost.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/happyhalloween.jpg"">my life has been missing this?</a>  Too long, that's how long.

Downloading P.P.-san 8 because I guess it came out when I wasn't looking.

This sort of thing excites me greatly."

Opposable thumbs are prettey awesome and I am glad that I have them.  I was never thankful for them until now.  I guess the whole ""oppose-"" thing threw me off and I passed judgement prematurely.  It just gave me a sense of aggression and opposition, like they were the bad-guy thumbs.  No longer...

"event","Came home from work yesterday and was feeling unlike I normally do when I come home from work.  Instead of manually fondling my penis in hopes of reaching orgasm I got a glass of water and drank it.  I also prepared a snack.  Then I picked up a book that was lying around out in the open where anyone could see it.  This must have been the good Lord's work, because instead of turning away and hmph'ing (is ""hmph"" even a verbable word?). I sat down and started reading it.

The book was Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.  The book told me how it was one of the most important book of our time.  I looked at my watch and noted our time.  Then, nearly an hour or two later I was over half way in the book, past one hundred pages.  How easy!  I should read more important and classic books.  This reading thing is so easy.  People make reading classic literature sound all hard and intense, but for my big brain it was like running really fast if I were a very fast runner.  I must have some athletic intelligence or something.

I am left with a feeling of incredible smartness.  A good felling warms my sole."

"event","Recently returned from New York.  Saw stuff and touched things.  <i>Producers</i> did not live up to the expectations my mind created for me from the various forms of hype it has received.  Just not as good without Broderick and Lane, maybe?  <i>Wicked</i> made up for it by being crazy rank good.  Ate foodstuffs as well.

Came home and some days later found that Peter Escott's <i>Missing Planet</i> had arrived for my hands and eardrums.  The first four songs were grand piano as I expected, but that is as far as my review can go.  For, you see, my car's c.d. player has refused to return to me my c.d.  Very seldom has it done such a thing, and never for so long.  It will not even play the music for me, selfishly hiding the music sounds behind the whirring noises of fake attempts to eject the disc.  I am not fooled, c.d. player!  No doubt the music starts as soon as I am out of hearing range.  But why?!  What could this all possibly mean?

Conclusion: <i>Missing Planet</i> is a most excellent compact disc!"

No, not really.  I'm just joshin' with ya'.  Hah!  Lol, Internet buddies!  I mean, what kinda' name is Shirley, when it's referring to a guy (and a sheriff at that)?  I mean, right?

Enough of that.  Howzabout some of this?  I'm changing things around, turning everything upside down.  I now know why I was put here on this world.  That's likely a lie.  At the very least, however, I now know why I still have this Live Journal account.  That's probably a shaky truth, but I'll run with it like it's rock solid earth.

In a fit of divine inspiration I was informed by a higher power what to do with this journal.  And after the shaking stopped I wiped myself clean and got up from the toilet.  The excitement of this episode in which I found my true calling left my bowels uneasy.  No, I simply hadn't gotten all of it out the first try.  This is a long way around it all.  Let's cut the chase and hope I don't forget to flush.

This LJ will soon become a hub for internet individuals the world over looking for some form of guidance in their lives.  The key to success and happiness will be publicly displayed for all to see.  Inspirational quotes!  Horoscopes!  Cooking secrets!  Free coupons!  Paypal donation buttons!!!

The future is a really big and super long road that doesn't have a map made for it yet.  This journal will be your Triple A (that's AAA).  It will give you all the exit signs you need to park your car of life at the Days Inn of I'm-so-happy-thanks-for-everything-Jon-(I-hope-paypal-let's-me-send-you large-donations-jon-or-else-I'll-have-to-send-numerous-smaller-ones-tee-hee-^_^!).

"event","This thursday is a day for slowly taking my brain back into my jaw space and making a light paste of frosting to carve over my creativity's cake.  I can't quite recall when it all started, but the major thing is the wasteful living that represents a large percentage of lively Liberians living in seaside Atlantis.  The plain flyers said it was an ""exotic wonderland of gravity sand and gravy train wrecks that will deck visitors hard enough they wet their pants and have the vacant vacation of their life.""  It looked like a go and I was in an odd mood, feeling an Arachnophobic amount of ago for the simple reason that I couldn't think of the word for that one scaredy-cat blues dish where one is afraid of not enough distance between themself and other plural amounts of Mr. and Mrs. and other things I suppose but a clue to this word would be nice because I don't think spider scaredness has anything to do with what I was talking about.  ""Ago,"" that's right, long ago a go-home-go-now-go was known for skills at Go, playing an offensive game like a better go-getter up the ass in a time of strife and tight ropes and, oh no, don't you know how to tie that knot?  It's not like that...  What would Charlton Heston think of this?  Hand me a cowboy hat and a marble vacuum pack so that I may blast off into space with a parachute pant jacket of stacks of paper.  Nicotine Man is smiling all greasy into the hand of the camera and we need him to look at the lens.  Lend us your strength, men!  There's enough to go around if you can only pretend to be the worm syrup of ten thousand dead Englishmen.  I don't think that will help the problem with my mouth bones currently wrapped around my head resident.  Not yet."

Which basically means that, while this may be a rough, in-progress choice of colors, it is also my final choice in colors.  Because, let's face it, I'll likely never feel like wasting this much time again on something as inconsequential as my <i>live journal color scheme</i>.  I have plenty of other inconsequential things to waste my time on in the future.  So, it looks like I'm stuck with what I've got.

Well, no, not <i>really</i>.  I didn't even throw up (""as far as I can remember"" and ""so I'm told"").  This picture is actually from something like two years ago, but I thought it somewhat appropriate, considering the way I felt on the morning of July one, American Normal-For-Me Time.  This also means that The Scanner is up and running.  Soon, I will have the printer ""up and running.""  After that, only Father Chronos knows.  Or is it Kronos?  I'm not into this spiritual, mystical, riding-a-bull hootenanny.  And it's not like it matters, anyhow.  Chronos or Kronos, the poor bastard isn't my real father.  It <i>does</i> matter that I don't know how to spell hoot'n'annie.  Did I fail to mention that the subject is all a lie?  It is.  Do you know why?  Of course you do.  Believe it or not, I was rather (uncomfortably?) on time with my birth and delivery.  I was speedy, coming something close to Gonzales.  No way did it take me 21 days to be birthed!!!

"event","...said that the skin on the male genitalia needn't be exfoliated each night.  In fact, one shouldn't exfoliate the penis any night.  Especially not for a period of time greater than an hour.  Beauty care techniques, such as exfoliation, tend to focus on a person's face, hands or any other areas that are less sensitive than a reproductive organ.  It is only natural to want pretty genitals.  Genitals which have skin that fairly glows with a radiant health.  Unfortunately, exfoliating your manhood may damage your goods, rather than beautify them.  Rubbing sea salt (available in health food stores) all over your body and face will not increase the radiance of your penis.  If you must exfoliate, avoid the penis.  Please stop rubbing small, hard, pebble-like objects roughly against your penis, jerk.

That's what it said.  I don't know if I should get tested again, though, because I didn't use sea salt to exfoliate.  Do you think that might change things?  Really, though, what am I going to do with all of this leftover raw sugar and olive oil?  What kind of recipes, aside from exfoliation, call for only raw sugar and olive oil?  Not many, I think."

I thought I should warn you, a man named David Rees (I think that's his name...) is speaking at the UICA on friday.  He's the guy that did ""get your war on"" (check out the main page here: http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/home.html ) and I guess he's on a book tour or something.  The events/tour schedule is here: http://www.mnftiu.net/mnftiu.cc/events.html .  Take the time to read some of his stuff if you haven't.  Although, when I try to go to the site I'm getting a 509 (Bandwith Limit Exceeded, duh...).  So, if it's like that all week, check out the UICA homepage.  Of course, my reason for bringing this to your attention is purely selfish.  If you do end up going and you have some extra cash on you, pick me up a copy of his book (I'll pay you back when I come home).  That's all for now, more later tomorrow...

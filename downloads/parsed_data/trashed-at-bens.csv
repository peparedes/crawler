I didn't pull off a very good Freshman year at Wabash, but maybe Sophmore year will be better. Although the fact that I'm not exactly sure if that's how you spell Sophmore might not help. 

Liz and I are doing great...I think.
Her parents are nice people. 
They don't like somethings I do. 
We are ""official"" now. 
I don't know that this really changes much. 

How you are feeling matters to me. 
I don't care if you are going to get over it soon. 
I want to know and hear about what's bothering you.
I wish you wouldn't hold that stuff from me. 
We will be better off if we can share those things. 
I miss you just as much as you miss me when we are apart.
I just show it in a different way.

I got a job at JP's. Bakey helped me out big time. Otherwise I'd prolly still be job hunting. Shitty. I start Tuesday. It ought to be funny at least. 

Well, I'm gonna go kick Ben's ass in yet another game.

"event","So, right now, I figured I would be somewhere getting drunk, but alas I am sitting in my room typing this stupid fucking thing. I used to think getting drunk and stoned was fun. It's really not anymore. I had two beers tonight...two, and it was stupid. I only did it because Bake offered, sorta, he just kinda gave it to me so I drank it. I think I just gained a couple pounds and that's it. 

I hate wanting to be somewhere else or with someone else when I'm with my friends. I can't explain why but it's like I don't enjoy their company anymore. I love my friends to death but I'm kinda bored with it. We do the same shit all the time. It sucks. It took hanging out with someone new to make me see that. Oh well, I'm sure I'll still do the same shit tomorrow. 

Relationships make me nervous.
Thinking about relationships make me feel sick. 
Wanting a relationship makes me feel stupid. 
Missing someone an hour after you saw them makes me feel even stupider. 
Being with that someone makes me happy.
I won't use the word love because I hate it, but whatever this is sucks. 

So, I'm contemplating going to church later today. It would make my mom happy. I wish she didn't care what I did. I hate church. There is no reason for me to go. I'll go, hear something I've heard thousands of times, not talk to anyone, then leave. Sounds like it's really helping my walk with God. Fuck that. 

I'm so stressed out right now. I just want to sleep all day Sunday. I prolly will today. I need a break. From everything.

"event","Well, this weekend was better than the last. I went to two shows. I spent lots of time with all my friends. I spent time with someone I really enjoy being with. Although, I did miss one of the biggest parties of the year. I also gave up all my poker chips at a point in the game when I had at least twice as many as everyone else in order to make someone happy. I don't mind though. It was worth it. 

So, Friday Liz and I hung out and had a good time hanging out in my dorm room. Although I was critized for most of the time. (kidding). Then we went out to Ben's so I could get him and his van. I then dropped her off at the library so she could go home. Ben and I then proceeded to Indianapolis to see Nodes of Ranvier, Still Remains, and the best band I've ever heard EYES LIKE KNIVES. (If anyone listens to this band they will know why they are so cool.) Well, that show was cool until I got kicked in the face and elbowed in the back of the head and almost passed out. It was fun. I then had to drive home and I pretty much talked jiberich the whole time. We went to steak-n-shake and it was funny because I had no idea what was going on. I drove over a ""median"" at one point. It was sweet. I finally got us home around 2 and I took some excedrin and went to sleep. Good day #1. 

Saturday I get a text from Liz saying that she can go to Bake Fest. Which I think should have still been called Brek Fest. Anyways, I went and ""helped"" Bake set up for the show. I didn't do much because I don't know how to set up a sound board. Well, the show started and Liz finally showed up and it was a good time. The only good band there was Base Defiler. I took Liz with me when I didn't want to stay and listen to About the Fire. We went to my house and she stayed in the car and my mom gave me a lecture about church. Oh well. Well we went back to Bake Fest and I plowed Ben in the ""Pit."" He's too small now. 

Later Liz had to go to her Grandma's and her and her cousin snuck out of the house and I went and got them so we could drop her cousin off in M-dizzle to hang out with Phil. Liz and I went to Lacey's house and I played some poker. I was doing really well and was the chip leader with four people left. Liz kinda gave me hints that she didn't want to be there anymore such as... Damn it I wish you would just lose. So since I'm good at poker, I had to just give up all my chips instead of losing them. It would have taken a very long time to lose them. So, we left and came back to my room and hung out for a couple hours. Then she had to leave and I went to Ben's and went to sleep. It was nice. Good day #2. 

Sunday I pretty much just slept. I did some homework. It was gay. 

Well that was my exciting weekend. I had fun.

I went to Alice's Saturday morning and that was hilarious as usual. Then later that day I went out to Ben's and lost some money. We ended up back at Alice's early Sunday  too. Sunday was interesting. I went to Indy. Wasted lots of time driving the wrong way on 465. Came back and went to Luke's and hung out there for a while. Then Ben Luke and I went out to Luke's parent's house to see Levi. Then I went home. It was a good weekend. 

A couple things happened this weekend that should have made me really happy. I don't know why, but they didn't. I still feel like there are things that have to be done for any of this to work. And it's hard not to think about those things. I don't like myself right now.

You could have anyone else. Someone more trustworthy, someone less ""easy"", someone more everything. Why me then? I mean ""fuck"".

I hope I stop being so retarded about this. 
I hope this all works out. 
I hope you are happy. 
I am when I'm with you.

I took like a 6 hour name at my house while I was trying to download some movies. Speaking of which, I now have the fourth season of Family Guy and didn't pay for it. Anyways, I finally came back to Wabash and just kinda sat here for a minute and enjoyed not worrying about anything. Then, I started worrying again. I realized that I'm not really doing well in my math class and there is a chance I might fail. Not good. I've also been freakin' out about some other stuff that I don't feel like getting into it because I always talk about it. 

Sunday was amazing. 
Even though nothing happened
I still feel like I overstepped my boundaries.
A lot more could have happened. 
Things that I wanted to happen. 
I couldn't let myself do it. 
I had a really good time though. 
Hopefully we can do it again soon. 

I get to host a prospective student tomorrow. I'm pretty sure I'm going to try and make him feel as uncomfortable as possible. It should be pretty funny. I haven't decided how yet though. I may just be a really big asshole. Iono. Updates later. 

The NCAA Tournament is stupid. I hate this whole month because of it. 

I've decided that I'm going to, instead of trying to look really nice all the time, I'm going to try and look as horrible as possible all the time. I'm going to try and become white trash as hell. It's gonna be sweet.

I have been going to sleep at around 6 O'clock AM for the past, oh I don't know, week. This is not good. Why? Because I have an 8 AM class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This means that this coming Monday I am going to need to stay up all night and go to bed at a normal time Monday night. This will hopefully throw me back into the loop of waking up at 8 AM. Fuck.<br /><br />So, tonight was pretty fun, I guess. I went with Ben and Lemon to a guy Lemon works with named Al's house. He was pretty cool, a Wabash man actually, which makes he cool no matter what... right? Anyways, we played some poker and Al took all our money, well, the money I borrowed from Ben. I got second so I got my money back and just gave it back to Ben. Who I might add needs to get a job and stop being a fag. I had a couple beers and some Jack. It was good. I like alcohol.

This could be informatioin that is good to know before trying to go. I've been told where, but I forget. It's late/early, I'm sure I'll remember sometime. Anyways, I heard of it being called, yes, Bakefest. We all know who Bake is of course. That fun, loving, teddy-bear looking mother fucker who needs to shave his chops. His band, Base Defiler is playing there and a couple crappy bands too. I think About the Fire is going to be there... and indeed, they are a crappy band. Bake likes 'em though. It's only like 7 dollars so I figure I'll go and have something to do on a Saturday night rather than getting trashed. And plus, one of my friends, who will remain nameless for the sake of privacy laws that don' t allow me to say her name on here, wants me to go.

"event","Okay, so wrestling is almost over now. Techniqually it is already over for me since I won't be making a trip out to nationals in NJ. I ended the season 17 - 26. This isn't terrible, but I think I could and should have done better. Oh well, now I'll just work for next season I guess. Also, for some unknown reason my weight has dropped since I've been eating all the time now. It's really weird. I figured I'd be weighing like 160 and I'm only at like 155 on a heavy day. Crazy!?!

I miss you. A lot. You were such a huge part of my life, now it's like we almost don't even know each other. It'd be cool to see you all the time, but I don't think it'd be good for me to see you all that often. It's complicated because I'm ridiculous. But still, I miss you. 

So, I've thought about it and I've come to the conclusion that it is not a good thing for someone, especially this person, to be ""intimidated"" of you to the point that they almost can't talk to you. I don't know why it's like this, but I guess it is. And do you think I'm not nervous around you? Yeah right. I can't see what you are so afriad of, though; I'm just one person. And not that great of a person anyways. I'm sure lots of people can vouch for that. You should lighten up about everything. It makes things easier.

Although I wrestled like shit on Saturday, I still got eighth and that's good enough for me. I now am 14-22. This is a whole lot better than I was doing seeing as how I was 0-5 to start out the year. Four wins and three loses. That's not too bad. I fucked up my knee though, and it hurts when I kneel on it. Which if anyone has every seen a wrestling match they'll know that it's impossible not to kneel on it. Well, I'm not complaining because I seem to be getting better at the right time, so, fuck yes!!! 

The one thing I hate the most about myself is that I get jealous so easily. I get jealous when I hear her talk about guys you like, and we haven't been together for like 8 months. I get jealous when someone else talks about her boyfriend. I hate when I do too. It's like GD why do I even care. I shouldn't be jealous. There is no reason to be. But of course, I get jealous and feel retarded afterwards. Damn it.

I made fifteen dollars for just sitting in a court room for about three hours and answering some simple questions that most of the time the answer was either yes or no. It would have been cool to be selected to be on the jury and make forty dollars a day, but I really couldn't miss my wrestling meet this weekend. So, I got dismissed pretty early and got to go home and sleep for a couple more hours. All-in-all, it was a good experience, and I get paid. 

For some reason, when you ask me to hang out with you, the first thing I do is think of something I can say so that I can't. I don't know why I do that. I just do. I still can't get myself to hang out with you yet. I'm still trying to figure some things out and I can't put into that situation yet. I'm not ready. It seems ridiculous, even to me. I've been told that the first true love will be the hardest to lose, and it was and still is. I feel like if there had been anyone else in the last seven(?) months, this would be completely different. I wouldn't feel the same way, but I geuss I'm not that lucky. 

I'm not sure what I did, but it seems like you don't even want to talk to me anymore. I thought that we were going to become closer friends through that whole episode, but it's like the exact opposite. You seem so wrapped up in everything else all of the sudden that I went from... hey I love being around you. I wanna start hanging out...to...who are you again?

"event","You won't be with me. Not becuase I don't want to, but because I'm done waiting on you. I will not as one person so kindly put it, wait on you like a puppy until it's convenient for you. It's obvious that you aren't going to leave him for me. And I just don't care anymore. I still want to hang out with you, but I'm not going to even act like I'm sad or mad that I can't be with you. I will always be your friend. But nothing more. Not now at least. I hope you know that you've missed a once in a lifetime chance. Last time I said this I changed my mind becuase of somethings you said to me, but I don't see that happening this time. It's not worth it. I've missed out on somethings because I wanted to wait on you. Well, ""Fuck that!"" You are a great friend and I ""adore"" you, but I can't do this anymore.

Today sucks. Thanks for talking to me Cassie. I wish I could be man enough to hang out with you, but I geuss I'm not ready for that yet. I will be someday. 

I can't wait for wrestling to end. Cuz you know what that means don't you? well, I like to call it Party Season. Which lasts until next wrestling season. It should be obvious that I am stealing this idea from Wedding Crashers, but it'll be the same concept.

He is probably the weirded person I have ever met, but some of the stuff he does is hilarious. We went to Crazy D's at like 4 in the morning and we ate and not much happened while we were eating, but afterwards we were sitting there talking and Mike decides to call Euvino's girlfriend. She was obviously asleep but she woke up and talked to Mike for like 20 minutes. All Mike did was make the rudest comments I have ever heard.  He started talking about her boobs and he asked her to describe them to him. And then he was like, are they exposed? Cuz I'm at your window. I dont know where this is going but this kid hilarious. 

I don't know what to think anymore. I don't know what you want. I'm so scared to say something wrong. When you said ""if something happens...it was meant to happen i suppose"" that leaves so much open for me to do. And I dont want to do something bad and you get upset.

I didn't think I would every hang out in a parking lot in my entire life. Friday night...I ruined that. We didn't stay there any longer than like 45 minutes but still I felt kinda gay the whole time. The only reason I stayed there was because of the people I was with. Well, one of them at least. 

I'm done ""holding back."" I'm not going to the next time I see you. I am by no means going to go overboard with it. But it made me uncomfortable to have to do that. I don't care what the consequences are. My want over trumps the consequences. It hurts to know what you've said to me and to know how you feel and you just continue to go on like this. I hate to have to put it this way, but you are going to hurt someone either way. It just depends on who's more important to you. I hate that I'm putting you through this, but I can't let myself be hurt because pretty much you don't want to hurt anyone. It's like you are just leading me on. I don't think you mean to, but that's how it's ending up. Being led on is exactly the way to someone's heart. 

You see something in me that not too many other people do. I don't know why that is, but you evidently like that about me. That makes me happy to know there is something about me you like. I'm not going to let you get away from me this time. Whatever the cost may be.

"event","Today wasn't too bad. I had to do a little bit of homework and go to a lecture at 7 PM. What?! Yeah it was pretty fucking stupid. Well other than that it was pretty good. Wrestling was decently easy becuase we played dodgeball for an hour. And I still managed to lose 5 lbs. Fuckin' Chuck Norris. 

I saw a video of Chuck Norris and Tony Danza, you know the guy from Who's the Boss?, yeah anyways, they were talking about all the ""facts"" that have been sent out about Chuck Norris. I think that Chuck Norris lied on camera to keep all those things a secret. He was like oh that's funny, but I think he really wanted to be like, yeah I did that. I could see it in his eyes. 

Well, I think it's done for. I don't have a chance with you and I guess I never will. I'm confused as to why you called me. I didn't mind, but there wasn't much of a purpose in the call. It hurt when you said you didn't want to hang out. Of course I said it didn't matter but what guy doesn't hide himself being hurt. I guess a gay one or something. Anyways, it hurts more to know that you still want it to happen. I have come to the conclusion though that you don't want it as bad as I originally thought. Most of the time, people get hurt when you are going after something you want. It's just the way it is. This brings me to the thought that if you're to scared to hurt someone, you don't want it that bad. Which I don't blame you for. I'm really not as great of a guy as you think. I almost hoped that we would hang out and you'd realize that you really don't want me and it would be easier for me to get over the fact that we won't be together. Don't worry about me getting mad at you for this. I understand. Like I said before, we are still friends and hopefully always will be. I thought we could have been good together, guess we'll never know huh? I hope your current relationship does well. But as far as this, I geuss I'm out. I won't stop wanting you, but I guess it's more logical to just move on. If ya ever find yourself boyfriendless though, give me a call. 

I fucking hate relationships. I think I'll go into the wedding crashing business. Good movie, and a very good idea. Now I just need to find myself a wingman. Who's with me?

At about ten O'clock, I went to Luke's and we hung out. Brian showed up and we went to Digger's. It was awesome. All we did was talk about Pride FC and tried to remember fighter's names. We were kinda unsuccessful. 

I slept 'til 12:30 today. It was amazing. Then I went and got some stuff from home and came back and sat around 'til 3. I went to wrestling and it was easy. Days before meets always are. Tomorrow is the Tri-state meet. It should be a good one. If anyone cares, it starts at 7. We are going to kill them. I was unaware but we are ranked 15th in the nation as a team. Awesome.

I shouldn't be sad that I haven't talk to you today, but I am. Its almost like my day is incomplete right now. I hate this. It just crushes me knowing you are with him right now. But that's okay, I'll get my chance with you someday.

I saw the movie Hostel today. The Big Ben Family, as I like to call them, took me to Lafayette because we were going to see the movie Wolf Creek, but instead we saw Hostel. It was okay. A lot of nudity which didn't bother me, but it was pretty bloody and gross. I had to turn my head a couple times. 

Next weekend is going to be a blast because for the first time in months I don't have a wrestling meet. YES! 

I have 100% completely, and utterly lost faith in the Indianapolis Colts. Fuck you Peyton Manning! I blame this on you. Although, you do have that sweet comercial where you get fruit signed and scream at employees for their aprons. HAHA! That comercial is hilarious.

Did I wait too long? Or was I misinformed? As far as I knew, you didn't want it to happen. And now that I know...it's too late. I guess I'm sorry I didn't say anything, but I had no idea. Don't worry though, I've said it before, I'll wait as long as it takes. I've got lots of time.

I swear I found one though. Only problem is, well we'll leave it at ""I cant hang out with...'EVERYONE'"". I think that's right. Anyways, I've had my eye on her for a while, but something always ruins things. Damn it. 

In about 9 hours and 13 minutes I'll be getting on a bus that will be making a 12...yes 12 hour drive to Pennsylvania. I will get to wrestle in a really nice tournament when we get there, but why does it have to be so far away? Damn it.

"event","Last Saturday was pretty amazing. Josh Keedy calls me at like 6 o'clock and we decide to go out to Big Ben's house. We figured there would be something to do out there, and oh were we wrong. Josh eats some shrooms and i get to drive his car and we hed of to colin whining's house. I thought we would be there for a while, I'd drink a couple beers and then we would head out. Well, that's not exactly what happened. Keedy ended up leaving to go see Hope, disregarding my advice to Drop That Dyke Like She's Hot! So I'm at Colin's all of the sudden Bake walks in. Him and I were pretty wasted so it was awesome. Josh Wren was there and he was hitting on this girl that i hadn't really met other than just seeing her at Wendy's and Judy and I made comments about her amazingly white teeth. Her name is Sarah. She asked me to help her get Wren off of her by acting like we were together. I was fine with this because she is a pretty girl and i was wasted. To make a long story short, this girl and i ended up kissing and it was sucky cuz she had to leave right when it happened.

The next day, i thought it would be a good idea to run out to Big Ben's house. Yeah, that sucked. I get out there and it's just Ben and Paula and their mom (the coolest old woman ever). We played a couple games of Euchre and it was fun, but I'm kinda Euchred out. So, we played a game that had a name something about a mouse or something, i dont really know but it was fun. In the middle of one of these games I get a phone call from Sarah. It was kinda weird that she found got my number but it was kinda like she was saying she was interested which definatly doesnt bother me any. Then Keedy and Kyle Brown come out and we getting messed up and i got with kyle and keedy and we end up back at colins house. Geuss who was there. Sarah, the only problem was, i was too messed up to do anything but watch these two dogs fight. It was pretty kewl.

So a couple days ago, Amy Hungerford tells me that she heard that Sarah and I are ""talking."" I was just kinda like oh...i was unaware. So now i need to talk to her about this and i dont really have a way to. So this is my problem. 

Anyways, This week is Bell week. Wabash Football is going to slaughter Depauw and we are going to bring home the MONON BELL. I going to the game and then I was going to come back and hang out with Amy and get wasted. But now im prolly just going to go somewhere and get wasted. Hopefully Ill see Sarah so i can talk to her. But that was my weekend and it was awesome. Ill prolly make another post talking about this weekend cuz im sure itll be a good one. Laters Bitches!

I can't help but think that I would have liked to have you back, but maybe it wasn't so much that it was you I wanted back. Maybe I just needed someone at that time and with you coming back into my life, which seems like it only lasted a month or so, I maybe it could be you again. 

I don't want you anymore. 

I've begun to see why I got over you in the summer. I can't think of one compliment you've given me since we started being friends again. I'm not saying that I praised you all that much either, but I don't want to be with someone who can't say something nice about me every once in a while. You are a great friend at times, but sometimes I don't even want to be around you. That can't be a good thing. And with this I am not saying that I don't want to be your friend anymore because I still do, but this is more for my benefit to be able to get this off my chest. I know that you were never worried about us getting back together and maybe that was a good thing in the long run. I won't change how I act around you just because of this either, and I hope you don't change the way you act around me. I'm just tired of getting into arguments with you because I'm more worried about how you think of me than just having a good time. 

I want to reiterate that I wrote this more for self relief than really telling you that I don't want you. It makes sense anyways since I never hear a word about these from you anyways.

I got drunk saturday night... i said i wouldnt anymore... i was scared to tell you... i know you dont care if i drink but i care if i lie... i didnt plan on it... i was going to play one round of beer pong and stop...well i ended up going to a house party and getting wasted... 

I had luke and the guys pick me up and we went to keedys where i managed to get pissed off about euchre and hit my head on the lamp stand... you would figure that a couch would have an arm on each side... but not for  mr keedy im afriad... 

I was more than excited to see you tonight... and the first thing you say to me is... i hate your hair... thank you for being happy or anything to see me... i didnt even get a hey i havent seen you in a while hug... i didnt expect you to jump on me and be like omg i havent seen you in such a long time i just wanna hug you forever or anything like that... maybe a hey how ya been hug because we are close(?) friends... to be honest...as i sat on your floor and watched you do my spanish homework (i hate spanish with my whole body and soul)... i didnt want to be around you at all ... not as friends...not as someone i want to be with... and i was done with you at that very moment... i told myself that i didnt need to put myself through that kind of shit... we started to argue becuase im a jealous person and i was trying to look past the fact that you talked to like four people and straight ignored me for and hour... im glad taco came and put an end to the arguement... 

Then all of the sudden you changed... it was a mid-stride switch of some sort... i couldnt help but want to be next to you... i dont know how you make me hate you and love you to death all in the same night but you did it... you have no idea how hard it was for me not to try and make something out of tonight... i am taking pride in the fact that i didnt push for more... i could have...and wanted to... but i dont know what would have happened if i did... i would rather not scare you away...or be shot down... neither sound appealing... i know how you feel about the situation... but not so much about how you feel about me... so i dont plan on trying anything... if it were to happen...spontaneous would be the name of the game... 

I thought i was ready to move on... i still feel a need to... but i can't get you out of my mind... when you call and sound disappointed when im not available... i dont know how to take it... many different things run throught my head... most of them are overly optimistic and i always feel like and idiot for even thinking it... because it never fails that something else is going to happen that makes me feel like im fighting a losing battle or for a lost cause... moving on would be hard...harder than anything ive ever done before... i thought i had over the summer...ya right... im back in the same boat as the beginning of last school year... except... i have to convince someone to like me again... it was easier last time... a lot easier... i feel like im in the middle of a game of tug-a-war... you pull one side.. and other chances pulls the other side...

it would be easier if you werent yourself... you can change a day for me... for better and for worse... 

its not even that i want to have the title of boyfriend... its that i want someone i can get close to... and feel secure... i feel like that when i hug you... when you dont let go for a while... just to see what ill do... but it would be nice to have that when we arent saying goodbye... i want too much i know... but i do wonder how much of this you take into consideration... it seems like not a whole lot.. but who am i to be the judge of that...

Luke, Ben, Harrington, and I tried to go to a concert last night. It was going to be one of the best shows in awhile, Norma Jean, Still Remains, Darkest Hour, and the Handshake Murders. So we drive up to the emerson theater, and we are standing in line with Jordan McGaughey and Chris Cox and some other people, and a man comes out of the Emerson and tells us that the show is sold out and no one can get tickets at the door. That sux. We didnt think about this show selling out. We figured since the last four hundred shows we've been to have had tickets at the door, we would be able to get them at the door and enjoy a concert. Well, we were wrong. So we ended up going to a place called BD's Mongolian Barbecue. I highly recommend going there. You pick out raw meat and veggies and whatever kinds of sauces you want and they grill it right in front of you. that part was really cool and it also tasted amazing. 

Oh...i almost forgot.. i turned the big 1-8 on Friday...and i want to apoligize to someone for cutting short our time to hang out on my birthday, but i had prior arrangments... and i enjoyed the half an hour or so we hung out anyways so...I'm sorry...

"event","<P>So for a while now I've been posting stuff about how much&nbsp;I still like a certian girl and how much it sucks that&nbsp;I can't have her and I've been pouring my soul into these posts. I feel like I'm whining constantly about this situation and I'm sure that no one honestly cares, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;still have to put my thoughts down or they will be stuck in my head and it may very well explode.</P>
<P>Talking with you tonight was <STRONG><U>relieving</U></STRONG>.&nbsp;I haven't felt this&nbsp;way about this whole thing in a while. And weird enough...nothing has changed. I just feel like you given me what&nbsp;I needed to make myself stop being bummed about this. I think&nbsp;I may be able to hang out with you and feel that happiness that you bring to me the <STRONG><U>whole time</U></STRONG>. I dont like getting upset becuz it obviously makes you upset too. And&nbsp;I just want you to be happy. <STRONG><U>With me and with everything</U></STRONG>. When you were mad at your mom today it was like&nbsp;I was with a completely different person. <U><STRONG>I didn't enjoy it too much</STRONG></U>.</P>
<P>I'm going to die if you leave this summer. You may think I'm kidding but&nbsp;<U><STRONG>I'm not</STRONG></U>. I went two months or so without contact with you, it was the worst 2 months of my life. I thought about you all the time and this will be no different. I'm not going to say that&nbsp;I don't want you to go, but it'll be hard knowing that you won't be around. Maybe you should go, it'll be a blast I'm sure. And I'll reiterate...<STRONG><U>if it makes you happy, then&nbsp;I am all for it</U></STRONG>. It's the weirdest thing, your mood can change my whole night. I was done with having fun for the night when you were mad. But when you left me with a feeling of happiness,&nbsp;I began to enjoy myself again. You have no idea how much you being happy means to me. <STRONG><U>I want to die when you are upset, especially with me</U></STRONG>. </P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>For the first time in a while,&nbsp;I am going to change the topic of this post</STRONG></FONT>.(Cue the music.) </P>
<P>Anyways, so being a Wally isn't as bad as everyone thinks. Yes&nbsp;I am still in town and <STRONG><U>C'ville still sucks</U></STRONG>. But, if you were to ever live on the campus of Wabash, you would realize that it isn't even like you are in Crawfordsville. When I'm on campus,&nbsp;I could be in Wyoming (???) for all&nbsp;I know. But the good thing about Wabash is that it is in my home town of Crawfordsville. I haven't spent a single quarter on the washing machines and dryers the whole time I've been here. I can go home and get a home cooked meal any time&nbsp;I want to...for free. I know almost everyone in town already. I know where everything is. And&nbsp;I haven't lost any major friends by coming here. I'm still in contact with Luke, Ben, Bake, Cassie, and everyone who has moved to a different town comes home every once in a while and&nbsp;I get to see them cuz there isn't a timing factor...<STRONG><U>I'm always here</U></STRONG>. So don't put down wabash...cuz <STRONG><FONT size=5><U>I'll prolly make more money than you someday anyways!!!</U></FONT></STRONG> </P>
<P>Well, it's getting late and I'm tired. <STRONG><U>I can finally rest without stressing out about something</U></STRONG>. Thank you Cassie...<U><STRONG>You're a doll</STRONG></U>...night all...(the whole&nbsp;2 people who will read this and think I'm an idiot.) </P>"

<P>&nbsp;I don't know if you are telling me that you do or don't want this... </P>
<P>I wish I knew what you are thinking... </P>
<P>Someone who can make me happy when I'm mad, sad, or just not in a good mood <FONT size=4><U><STRONG>by just being with me</STRONG></U></FONT>; that's what I've always wanted. Friends is a good place to be, but I can't help but want more. I promised I wouldn't force this on you and <FONT size=4><STRONG><U>I won't</U></STRONG></FONT>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I just want to be happy, but I don't want me being happy to in turn make you unhappy. That is not what I'm about. </P>
<P>I dont know what to do...</P>
<P>It is <U><FONT size=4><STRONG>so</STRONG></FONT></U> hard to let you go when we hug...</P>
<P>It is <FONT size=5><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>so</U> </STRONG></FONT></FONT>hard not to just grab you and pull you close to me and kiss you like I used to... </P>
<P>I'm stumped...I have no solution for this...</P>
<P>I wish you were with me right now...we could settle this...</P>

"event","ok...i didnt really get around to this on the weekend but its better now than never. I'm sure most of you already know that on saturday i went to a party and ended up in the hospital. it was pretty amazing. i was just minding my own business and all of the sudden im laying on the ground. so i jump back up and keep going. what i didnt realize was that i had successfully split my open and i was bleeding all over the place. When i got outside, someone noticed and they decided that i should probably leave the party. Although i didnt want to i went never the less. i made it back to my dorm alright and everything but it kinda started to turn for the worse. i began to throw up and i started puking up blood so that was good. my good friends in my dorm and a couple of girls i met a couple weeks ago took it upon themselves to take care of me and i greatly appreciate that. So i went to the hospital and gto 7 stitches in my eye and had to stay at home that night. It goes without saying that my parents werent too happy, but luckily they took it very well and just told me not to do it anymore. i may have to take that advice. so that was most of my weekend.

On sunday, i decided that i was in the mood to see my good friend cassie. she is a doll and she helped me get through this situation by making fun of me all over the place. But i witheld the assault of insults and actually had a reasonably fun time with her and her mom in laffeyette. her mom bought me steak-n-shake so i kinda felt bad since it was just out of nowhere. but i really appreciate the free food. Cuz we all know that free is the best adjective to be put in front of noun. Anyways, so i hung out with her and she ended up helping me do my spanish cuz im a retard and she's a lot smarter than me when it comes to foriegn languages. after i walked cassie back to her car.. i decided that it was time for a mcdonalds run, but i had to make a detour to cassie's house to return her phone but i didnt mind all that much.

Monday was filled with some interesting events that are still making me wonder what the heck was goin on. Most of the day was normal, i went to all my classes and had a test in religion 141 but it wasnt all that bad. I then went to wrestling practice where i had to explain to coach that i had fallen and busted my head open. He didnt really care but i have to wear a face mask until it heals which sucks balls. Then i called cassie to see what she was doin and she asked me to come and help her with her math since she had helped me with my spanish and i gladly went and helped her while she was indulged in Laguna Beach(this show is stupid). I then decided that i was tired and i need to take a nap so i just slept in cassie bed.(something that until not too long ago was a normal activity) so i wasnt all that uncomfortable doing this. the thing that puzzled me was the way she was acting the whole night. i dont want to get into details because im sure she'll deny that any of this is accurate but i just made me more confused about this girl than i already was. 

well that was my amazing weekend! it really wasnt too bad since on sunday and monday someone put me into a better mood than i probably should have been in, and i thank her for that. i dont know what it is...but im never sad when im around her...it amazes me..even as im writing this, i dont know what it is about her...anyways...ill prolly post a pic of me in the hospital cuz im pretty sure ill get one...itll be awesome...laters"

"event","A certian girl has stolen my interest in the last week or so...i didnt think that we would ever hang out after what had happened. We finally did tonight...after i neglected to call her last night and have her come over...but i was distracted by a soccer game i was currently in and i forgot...i got quite a bit of shit for it...i apologized and hopefully she really does forgive me. I always enjoy seeing her because she makes me happy when she's around, but i always feel like i shouldnt have hung out with her afterwards, only because it makes me sad that it's not the way it used to be...I know ive been bitching about this for a long time but its like its getting worse everytime i see her. I felt like we're making progress at being friends and it not being awkward for either of us...but i still feel like there is something missing...i don't act the same way around her as i do around all my other friends who are girls...it's like i can hug or sit close to any of my other friends who are girls and it doesnt really bother me or make me feel one way or another, but i know if i tried to act that way around her...i'd either feel awkward or she is going be like...what are you doing... and i dont want that to happen..i would rather still be her friend than be able to act one way with her and have her freak out or something... i dont know how to talk to her about this whole thing either... she reads all these and is prolly creeped out about it... and wonders why i never just say something to her but i cant get the courage up to confront her about what's going in my head... and i would like to know how she feels about this whole thing...other than that she will never give me another chance...which sucks...but i act like i dont care...i hate this...i hate bitching about this...but until something happens that satisfies me...ill prolly continue to talk about this... and chances are...ill be talking about it for a while... fuck..."

"event","So why is it that everytime i think something cool is going to happen...it always ends up sucking? We were supposed to have a kick-ass party tonight on my floor...yeah wasnt exactly what i would call kick-ass...then i go out to Lemon's to see what is going on out there...a bunch of ppl i dont know were their and i just left...i came back hoping maybe something had happened and there would be some ppl on my floor doing something...once again...a negative...

I seem to be having the same problem with girls...i thought something cool was going to happen...and it didnt...not even a chance...it turns out that she's like someone else for like 5 yrs...i dont know if this is true or not..but it makes me feel like shit... i dont know why my luck with girls sucks...i just want someone i can hold...and hang out with too.. im not asking that much...but it evidently is too much for some ppl...now she thinks im not gonna talk to her...yeah right...shes like my best friend...no matter what happened..when i hung out with her again...it just sparked back up...i love her...in more than the bf-gf kinda way...i dont want my life to be without her...but i know if she gets with some other guy...im gonna just be too jealous to be able to hang out with her...i hate the fact that i dont stand a chance with her... i was willing to change...willing to work for this...she doesnt even care...i fucking cant stand it...it keeps me up at night...and it's like she doesn't know where im coming from...i wish she would just try to understand...

and its not like i can just let her slip out of my life...i tried that...and look where it got me...wanting her just as much...and not being able to have her...i know shell read this and be like...omg he's still going on about this...wont talk to me about it... she always said that if we were meant to be together we would...so does that include when she just shuts every chance of us being together down? doesnt make much sense to me...a lot of ppl have told me it's because she immature...i don't know if id disagree with them...but i obviously am not the smartest person when it comes to stuff like this...

I just wanted her to be more open about the situation..and i dont think she cared...i tried to talk to her about it...and it never happened... i dont know what to do...just talk to me...that's all im asking...just talk to me...

Why am i so drunk...you prolly can't tell cuz i type ultra awesome...but i am..and im going to bed..."

"event","So last night was an interesting night. I went to the high school football game because it was homecoming and i knew that a bunch of the people from my class would be there, and i was right...

After the game i went and hung out with isaac,susy, danielle, two of her friends, bake, kelley lowe and lyndsey servies and ashley johnson at isaac's house. we ended up going to diggers and i spent way too much money on food. but it was fun. After we got back...i decided that i wanted to jump from the top of bake's van to the top of my car... it kinda dented the roof.. but it is okay... 

I then proceeded to go out to Lemon's when some crazy girl started honking at me.. and told me to go to her house. So i did and we hung out for a while on her trampoline. it was fun for the most part, with the exception of being argued with constantly, and hearing all her stories about guys...made me a lil jealous but i got over it. 

I finally made it out to lemon's and i decided that i was going to get shitfaced.. and i did. we messed with ben for a while because he was way past the point of being drunk and it was funny. I felt kinda bad tho. according to a source who was at lemon's at the time...tells me that i evidently started rolling around on the ground talking about how i didnt want anyone to tell a certian girl about this night and how much i cared about her. So i professed my love to her for like 20 minutes while i was laying on the cofee table. I was told that i was also starting to cry when i was talking about her. Which either means i let out the truth to some of my friends or.. iono.. im a crazy drunk.. i would rather think the first one.. but whatever. 

I've already made my comments about her on here in the last post so no need to continue to make myself depressed or try to get people to feel sorry for me. I will just have to deal with the reality of it."

"event","So... my first day of school is tomorrow.. I'm so glad that I am going so far away..(sarcasm all over the place).  I don't think it will be all that bad though. And what more could i ask for than to sit on my ass at home the last night i have to do anything for a couple days. 

I thought that i was going to start over new on the whole girl thing. Realized that someone who has been a friend for a while could maybe be more... thought it was mutual.. i think i was wrong. No big deal though... ill get over it.. prolly already have. 

I cant wait to start having classes take up my time rather than sitting around thinking about shit that happened a long time ago... 2 months maybe.. i hate dwelling on it.. i hate that i cant even get up the courage to talk to her... i hate that she'll never read this... i do miss her.. i did love her.. and i still do.. i guess all good things must come to an end.. fuck love... 

well im tired of dipping into my thought... doesnt happen often.. if you read this.. you should feel priveledged... and i cant spell for the life of me.. well.. laters..."

I also took off tomorrow and today. yay! At least I will save some money on gas. sheesh. 
We have a LOT of painting to do. There is the great room, halls, laundry room, 3 bathrooms, kitchen, den, and 3 bedrooms!
Its going to be a lot of work but it will look cool when its done! I can't wait. 
Saturday we are picking up our Amish made oak table we got a great deal on! yay for craigs list :)
Then June 1st we get our bed set and the 2nd our sofas!! I LOVE our sofas. They are SO comfy. 
We just need to figure out what we are doing with the flooring. It needs to be replaced in all the bedrooms and great room. We might try to get wood. 

We are also going to buy washer and dryers this weekend! They are going to be awesome :)

"event","We got a house! its so exciting that they came back to our counter offer after 3 weeks! yay! We are closing on the 30 but then they have up to 30 days to move out. I hope they are moving out by Memorial Day weekend so that we can go in and clean and get stuff prepped for some painting. We're going to paint the bedroom and the kitchen. Also maybe the great room depending on how it looks after its empty. 
YAY!
Its a great house, it doesn't need much work at all. Well except for landscaping. Its pretty much got only a few small things.

This is the house that we have liked since we saw it :) I love that all the light fixtures in it match. we saw some really ugly ones! The kitchen is my favorite out of the ones we have seen and its got wood floors :) I like the wood floors so much better then the ceramic ones. its much warmer feeling. 

We've been buying stuff for the house. All the small things we've bought can really start to add up. We're doing okay tho. We just need to find furniture. I have a bedroom set so at least we don't need to get that right away. yay!

buying a house is so exciting! Its even better now that S is likely going to be working where I work! Thats great becuase its more money for him and plus its closer and now we can carpool! I won't be working with him at all, he'd just be in the same building. So exciting. It will be a lot less stressful for him to work there. 

S is so stressed and worried lately. He's got a lot on his mind so I try not to bother him TOO much about house stuff. His dad was diagonised with prostate cancer. They also found a spot on his kidney and are going to do an MRI friday to determine if its cancer or just scar tissue. I  hope that its not cancer. Things are going to be hard enough as it is. 

As for wedding news I booked the Church but now we are trying to figure out our timeline. I want to see S before the ceremony and do some pictures but he is ""unsure"" because everyone he knows who saw each other before the ceremony is now divorced. I told him that fact didn't matter, something else probably went wrong with the marriage. we'll figure it out. 

well I need to get to bed now. 
This is probably full of spelling errors but oh well for tonight..."

"event","There are so many thing going on lately. Last week my grandpa passed away and we held all the funeral arrangements. I was happy that the weather was great for each of the three days and that it was sunny. S came to the funeral and wake with me. He doesn't do well at funerals because of thigns and therefor he drank too much at the wake. Grandpa got a lot of flower arrangements! 45 all together. They were very pretty. We have som eof the ones that were plants. I hope that they will do well. With the funeral and me being sick I only worked 5.5 days over 2 weeks. So that was a nice break from work. I also got excused from my homework 1 week which was great!

We've kept on looking at houses I think we've seen about 24 or so now. It seems like more and more are starting to be put up for sale as spring gets closer. We seem to be getting closer to finding one we like. I am glad that we have a nice realtor. We also went to a home buying seminar and got contact information for another broker we are going to check out. 

The semester is going to be over in a few weeks! I'll be glad for the break. I still need to decide what class I want to take next semester though. 

The wedding planning contines. I bought a dress! It is just the look I wanted. I also got it for a good deal because I bought the sample, and it fits PERFECTLY except for the length. 
Now I have to find shoes and get it hemmed. 
We also have to find a DJ and videographer. Those are next on our list...

I think I should get back to working on my homework now"

"event","Things are not good with my grandpa. He has been in the hospital for about a week now, they found liver cancer and a spot on his lung that may also be cancer but they have not been able to biopsy it. He was put on a ventilator today because he was having too much trouble breathing because of fluid in his lungs. I hope that he can come out of it. My uncle, a Dr. said that he has seen people get better after being on a ventilator and also S's grandma had fluid in her lungs before and is still around and doing okay. 

At least I was able to get an extension for my homework this week. I just am not motivated to do it. 

In other news we are looking at houses. We offered on one, they countered, we said we are going to still look and they countered again and said we'll include the washer and dryer. We are not going to answer them until we look at 4 more houses tomorrow, as along as the weather is nice. I hope it will be! I also hope it will be nice because I plan on going down to the Hospital to see my Grandpa if he is going okay. 

I am going to be staying home to watch Penny cause my mom is going to stay with my Grandma tonight. At least I am able to use some sick time. I am glad that work is flexible. 

I'm glad that I got a massage today :) That helped some of my stress."

Lets see. 
Christmas was good. I got mostly clothes, jewelry, and hot chocolate. I did get a cool fold up packing knife. Its red :)

New Years was fun. S took me to the Hilton and we spent the night there and just relaxed and enjoyed some wine. It was nice. 

I've been doing lots of wedding planning lately! Its a lot of work. I think we are settled on a hall now. We just have to decide on family style or buffet. 
I also came up with an idea for centerpieces. I am not going flowers but a vase with some various size 'ting ting' in it. They are navy blue, sparkly silver and sparkly blue. I got enough for all our tables for only $25! all on clearance at Joanns! that store is great!. I also got blue vases and marbles on sale at joann's. I am putting that in the middle on a mirror. Then am putting 4 6.5"" votive candle holders around it with blue candles. I got the candle holders on sale too! All and all its going to not cost too much :)

We also are pretty much set on a photographer! We just have to talk to S's aunt to see if she is willing to pay for her. She said she would but I don't know  if she realized it would cost about $4k!"

Then S proposed to me! I was surprised but also was expecting it because we had talked about it in the past. My ring is wonderful. He told me that he has a matching wedding band which is probably going to look great with it! Its white gold with a round diamond in the center and 5 princess diamonds on each side. Beautiful!

Things are going to be so busy in September?
First a Labor Day party at my friend's from work. Then my Grandma's Birthday this weekend. Then School starts again. Then I get a 3 day work week! yay for that! Then going to the Ren Festival the following weekend and having my Aunts 40th birthday party. The weekend after that might be free I don't remember. Then my Dad's birthday. The last weekend in September I am going camping with S. It should be fun! I hope the weather is nice. I love the smell of fall. We will make smores! yummy!

This past weekend S and I went and looked at engagement rings. We found the perfect one! and of course they only had one left of it! It was very pretty even without the center stone in it. It was part of a wedding set. I wonder if he is going to go back and get it and if they will still have that one. I pray they do. He loved it more then any of the other ones he's seen he said. I can't wait!
I also got my highlights redone on Friday. They sure are Red! I love how it looks in a few weeks when the color starts to fade slightly and it blends in nicely with my hair. hot.  :)

I need to try to sleep now tho cause I didn't get to bed until 12 last night cause I was reading a book. it was a good book. I read it over the course of 3 nights I think. Pretty fast for a 375 page book I think. if Only I could read my textbooks that fast... lol."

Today is my one yr. anniversary with Sebastian :) I am so glad that things have been going so good wtih us. We are talking more seriously about buying a house. I just wonder how complicated the taxes will get. We are thinking about building a house cause then we can pick out the colors and stuff we like and don't have to worry about repainting a pink room or anything like that. 
we went to fondue Friday and Sebastian got drunk, it was fun and he needed to relax and just have some fun. They made great martinis there!

Today I finished up my exam and emailed it back to the professor. I am glad to have a break for now! Things are just so busy lately. a break is nice. 

This week is going to be crazy cause my sisters are getting ready to go up to CMU for school. They have their junk all over the living room. The poor dog can't lay on her favorite rug. Its going to be much quieter once they are gone also. yay! I like when its quieter. 

My swim fins came in the mail yesterday! I am going to try them out tomorrow! yay! I hope it doesnt thunderstorm when I go swimming cause they will close the pool then. 

I should fall asleep soon but I am not really tired. I need to sleep tho cause I have a meeting tomorrow at 1. I need to work the computer for. fun stuff. blah to that. 

I really need to straighten up my room some and put all my paperwork from this semester somewhere and throw out what I don't need. I hope the prof. doesn't take forever to grade our exams. 

I need to get a bunch of things done,(in no order) order more pics from our trip, scrapbook them, help move my sisters out, maybe visit some open houses, figure out some money things, work out more, stress out less and sleep more. busy busy. I also need to plan a camping trip and this week I am donating blood. 
I don't mind donating blood. It will help someone out eventually and work lets me take up to 4 hrs off to do it. So I leave at 1:30 donate the blood then go home early. It works out for me and the Red Cross.

"event","Day 4.
This was one of our least busiest days, but one of the hottest!

We walked across town to the wharf after breakfast. We didn't eat at the JJH because that was just a joke. Not much food was left and they only had apple juice. 
We got to the place to get tickets for 10:30 whale watching but they said they sold out. So even tho we had reservations we had to go on the one at 12:30. Two companies were trying to both do reservations and it was obvious that the managers could not communicate with each other well. Oh well. 

So we went to the aquarium in the mean time. They had some cool penquines there. We watched a show where they talked about them. They said they clean the tanks daily so that it does not smell. The tanks are in the open air and you can walk around and see the different types. 

After looking at the aquarium we went to get in line for the 3 hour whale watching. It was pretty much an hr out to sea, an hr watching the whales, then an hr back. It got colder as we got farther out to sea, I think we went about 25 miles out. S was doing fine but then got seasick because of the waves. I was fine the whole time. So he ended up being sick about 2/3 of the trip and didn't get to see as many whales. We really only saw three, a mom and her baby and then another female one. We were able to see them dive and bring their tail up twice. I was able to get one picture of a tail. 
afterwards we walked through Quincy Marketplace and got some food. Then we just took it easy the rest of the night cause things closed early on Sunday and S wasen't feeling good. We walked through the Boston Common then back to the hotel."

"event","Day 1
All day at work I was just waiting to leave. I didn't get much accomplished except printed out a few maps for us in case we needed them and looked over the schedule once again. 
After work Sebastsian came over and we packed all my things in the car. Going on a 10 day trip I had lots of things to bring! I took my largest suitcase, it was heavy. I didn't know what the weather would be like tho, thats my excuse. 

We drove up through Port Huron to Canada to Niagara Falls. All the way to the falls the construction was let up for the holiday weekend, except on I-94. 
Also we never saw one police car in Canada so we made it to the falls in good time. 
Once we checked in we unloaded our stuff and then just relaxed in the Presidential Suite we were upgraded to! It was very nice and large and clean. We used the jacuzzi tub and relaxed before our very busy next day. 

Day 2 

We woke up and tried to get breakfast in the 'Club Lounge' but that was a joke. Stupid people. So we left and went on our way. We walked from out hotel to the Rainbow bridge to the U.S. and went to the visitors center to get our discount booklet. Then we went to take the Maid of the Mist Boat ride. It was fun! I had forgotten my waterproof camera at the hotel so I just put a clear plastic bag I had over my digital camera and it seemed to work ok. After the boat ride you go up to the observation tower so we did that for a little bit and took pics. 
Then we walked to the Cave of the Winds. They give you your own pair of water shoes. weird, but needed cause your feet get wet! There was a bit of a wait for the elevator down. How annoying when wearing a bright yellow poncho. It was fun though. We saw some rainbows. 

After this we decided we needed to eat so we went to the top of the falls reastraunt. The service sucked but the food was good and we got free fries. I didn't care tho cause I didn't want them anyways. I think we only left a $1 tip. 

Then we decided to walk around Goat Island to see the Three Ssters islands and the rapids leading to the falls. We had just gotten to the end of the island when is started to rain. So we pulled out the ponchos from the boat ride and walked back to the trolly stop. After waiting a little bit we crammed into the trolly and rode that to the Aquarium. While going there is stopped raining. 
The aquarium was ok. Mostly fish. There were some seals that they keep outside all year round! They said it mimics their natural habitat. Neat. Then we walked to the Gourge Discovery Center which showed us a video and taught us some history. They also had information about hiking that you could do. We decided we wanted to walk down to the whirlpool rapids so we took a trail. Only problem was that there was no trail leading up the cliff around the bridge so we just had to turn back around. Oh well. By that time it was getting late and we still had a long walk back to the hotel. 
So we got back to the center then took the trolly to the bridge and walked back to drop off our stuff. Then we relaxed a bit (after walking 9 miles!)and changed for dinner. 

Down the street was this really cool Brazilian Steakhouse. Copacobana. it made me get the song stuck in my head. The waiters would walk around with meat on big skewers and had large, sharp knives. They would go table to table and give you pieces of each type of meat. It was good! The cinnamon sugar pineapple was the best! The drinks were good too. So after awhile we wanted to leave to catch the fireworks. But their computers crashed and it took too long to get the bill. So in the meantime we just ate more pineapple. Oh well we didn't get to see the fireworks. At least we were going to not miss them in Boston!

Then we went back to the hotel and used the jacuzzi tub again. Might as well get our use of it since we paid for it!

Day 3

We checked out of Niagara Falls and drove allot. It was about an 8 hour drive. 
There was some difficulty in finding the B&B we were staying at but we found it after calling them. The place seemed okay when we got there the room had a somewhat musty smell to it tho. We unpacked then went to the parking garage they used. It was just a valet type garage. Well it looked shady and Sebastian didn't want to leave his keys with them so we went back to the hotel. We asked the front desk lady if she knew of another garage nearby. She said no. Thats preetty stupid considering that you probably live in Boston if you work there!?! So we used the free internet to find another one a few blocks over. We went and parked. 

Then we walked over the bridge to Cambridge to the Cambridgeside Galleria Mall. We walked around and I bought a pair of pants and couple of shirts. No sales tax on clothes in Mass.! kinda neat. Then we ate at the Cheesecake Factory which was just yummy!

It was getting later so we decided to take a cab back to the hotel. We get one and then get going. I notice a sign saying towards the airport. I ask the driver if he knows where he is going cause we are no where near the airport. So he pulls over and we re-tell him where we are going to. i even had to pull out a map and show him! He turned off the meter and eventually got us back to the JJH and didn't charge us as much. Sheesh. you would think that you would make sure you knew where the place was before you started driving!

So we went back up to the room and got ready for bed. Sebastian was checking the sheets and found a few hairs on them. We called the desk and asked for new ones to be brought to us. The lady was kinda rude and said that we would have to come get them because no one else was at the desk at that time. So we had to re-make our bed before going to sleep. The bed wasen't very comfortable either."

It was a fun day!
Sunday was ok. I went to S's grandma's for dinner with his family. I don't mind going there except I wish they wouldn't speak in polish so much. I don't understand them and feel left out sometimes. His grandma is 70 something tho. So I guess its hard for her to change her ways. At least the food was good tho. There is always so much of it.

"event","*sigh* well my sister is home from school now. It was so much nicer and quieter when she was gone. I can't wait until she goes back to college. My youngest sister is going to be going to the same college. so the house is going to be really quiet!! I can't wait! its going to be peaceful and I can park in the garage then! 

I am so glad all this rain stopped. I want to get back to working outside. I am helping my BF fix up the landscaping in his pack yard. So far we have one area done but there is still lots to do! It will look nice when its all done then we are going to have a BBQ! it will be nice to look at it all when its done. It will give us something nice to look at while swimming once the pool is opened and cleaned. I'm excited. His dad is being a pain, Well if he  tho because he got divorced a few months ago and keeps on saying that he is depressed and stuff. did more then just sit on the computer reading the ex-wives blog and writing in his own maybe he would feel better. He doesn't do anything around the house so my BF has to do things and that makes him stressed out. 

At least we are going to WI next weekend for memorial weekend. That should be fun. We are going to the Mini Baha competition then to milwaukee. I have never been there so it should be fun. 
I can't wait till we go to Boston in July. That will be fun! I like taking vacations. 

Well I hope that the weather is good for the weekend cause I am going to a picnic! yay! picnics are fun. I am going to being a kite and will fly it if its windy enough. Its a butterfly I think, it looks cool. 
Well time to get to bed soon. got more training at work tomorrow.."

"event","Hmm. 
Well this past weekend I saw 3 houses. They were all nice but each one needed some work done. the last one was the best. 
Now I am thinking about what I want.
Do I want an older house (25-30) with mature trees and a larger yard. The house will more then likely need updates with paint, maybe plumbing and a hot water heater cause they only last so long. 
Or do I want a new house (built 05 or 06). With a smaller yard, no landscaping or grass? There would not need to be much work done inside. However it probably wouldnt come with appliances. A lot of work would need to be done outside and there would be no large trees. 
A large yard would be nice to have but those homes are in an older neighborhood. The new homes are more north. Which would mean a slightly longer drive to work but the house may hold its value better because it seems like everyone is moving north. But there is also more traffic up that way because the roads were not made to handle all the traffic..

such things to think about...

on a brighter note I asked my ex-fiance what mortgage company he used and he told me they paid his closing costs. I will have to look into them more and see if they'd pay mine!"

That he wishes I would have tried to stop the wedding. He wishes he never got married to her cause she cheated on him and used him for his money. he told me I was awesome.He told me I did a kick-ass job painting his bedroom. he told me I was the best gf he had and the only one that didn't use him. he told me that he wants me to be happy. He told me he broke up with me because I was almost graduating and he was not, and that I made more money then him. He told me that he misses me. he told me he misses the way I treated him. He told me that he loves me...

So we chatted for awhile. then I told him that I am happy with Sebastian and am not going to break up with him. Then I told him that Sebastian wants to get me a ring and I would more then likely say yes. 

he didn't like that and told me that he doesn't think he can talk to me again because of how he feels for me. 
then he signed off online. 

I thought that was kinda immature of him since he was also talking about how he 'grew up more' and was more mature...

These articles on this site give a lot of examples of how things can go wrong with SSNs, credit cards, insurance and other things. A lot of times they are related to stolen identities. It makes me worry somewhat. 
I think that the government should be able to protect its own citizens well enough so some Mexican can't come over here and steal our identity!
There are also so many problems with the health care system it seems. Who knows what the world will be like when I retire. At least if I stay where I am at my retirement plan should be safe.. but who knows... after all... I work for the government."

Also this year I am planning on taking a few trips with him, and by the end of the year we might be engaged! 
I was engaged before to someone else but now I am glad we broke that off. Sebastian, my current bf, is able to fit my high standards well :)"

To travel (wherever) with someone
To stay in a hotel and do hotel-y things just for fun
My arm and other bits to be fixed so I don't hurt or struggle anymore
To feel important, not just be told I am

I still remember the last time - painful and extremely distressing, that they didnt even get to the second part of the test where they would <i>stick needles into my arm</i> and electrocute me that way.

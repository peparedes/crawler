And on a happy note, i bid you goodbye with a fucking great song and artist. 


There's blood in my mouth 'cause I've been biting my tongue all week 
I keep on talkin' trash but I never say anything 
And the talkin' leads to touchin' 
and the touchin' leads to sex 
and then there is no mystery left 

And it's bad news 
Baby I'm bad news 
I'm just bad news, bad news, bad news 

I know I'm alone if I'm with or without you 
but just bein' around you offers me another form of relief 
When the lonliness leads to bad dreams 
and the bad dreams lead me to callin' you 
and I call you and say ""C'MERE!""

I also realized that there are a lot of people I used to talk to a lot...but i dont anymore. I really do miss them and it makes me sad that I don't talk to them very much. Which is why im going to try and make an effort and call some of these neglected friends who I really do miss!

"event","Well i havent updated in a wile so here it goes. Nothing very neat has been going on with me. School and thats about it. I go out and what not. Last night I went and hung out in LA with my hoe Yeseina<3 It was fun. I missed her a lot. Then when I got home today I rented a bunch of movies including my favorite movie...A Walk To Remember....Yes haha I love that movie so much. I cried so hard watching that movie. And I'v seen it like 2 times before that....Just not in a very long time. I'v been crying a lot. Im not to sure if its really good for me. I think it is. At least I have a heart and I care about things. But anyway I wanted to say that I love that movie so much. When I fall in love, I want the guy I am with to treat me just like Landon in the movie. Ha cheesey yes, but so true. He loved her so much and totally dedicted his life to loving her. That is just so romantic to me. I love it<3 Haha ya here I am getting all emotional about this but I just want to be in love. Im not going to push it. I know it dosent happen like that but when it dose happen im going to be the happiest girl in the world. There is this one boy who I know that when I meet him we will fall so hard for eachother. He is such a wonderful person and so loving.Even if we never end up together, I really just want him to be happy. But I would give up anything to be with him. He seriously makes me smile like no one else. To bad I cant have him. I hate that all the perfect guys are out of your touch and live a million miles away. But thats okay. One day...if things are ment to be, they will happen. I know it. Haha im such a hopeless romantic and im very cheesey but im just so in love with love<3

"event","Well im not sure whats wrong with me but for the first time in a long time I really really wished I was someone else. Im tired of everything about my self. I wish my hair was different, I wish I could be skinnier and most of all, I wish I had someone in my life. I have being lonely so much. And with the simple fact that I know im dating someone. I always start to feel better about my self. I know I shouldn't wish for things like different hair or a different body because that all sounds so materialistic. But looks wise. It's not really about that. I just want to be someone different. Not even different really. Just different from what I am now. Sometime I wonder if I would just be better off looking like everyone else in the world. Plain and normal. No bight colors or crazy hair or piercing. Just a normal girl. I know my family would like that. But they are part of the main reason why I don't feel like being normal. They do and don't really see past all of my features which at some points just makes me want to be even more flamboyant ha-ha. But my point is I guess....that I just bah. Im not happy with my life. If I look past all the physical attributes to my whole problem, I really think im just dying for a different life style. I guess it's more of a mental problem. All I want is to be happy. Happy with my life. Happy with my school. Happy with my looks. Happy with the friends and that boyfriend I don't have. I really wish things could just all fit into place like that. Other than that school has been pretty shitty. I like my first period drama class and that's about it. I don't really have many friends. I never really do. And I don't want a lot of friends. But it sucks not having a best friend by ur side. 

""Life is an ugly, awful place not to have a best friend.""

And that is so true. when I first read that I thought it sounded a little childish. But it's not at all. I guess through the time period I am going through right now I best friend is essential. Maybe not later on in life when im married and have kids. But at the moment I seriously feel like its crucial to have a best friend by ur side. Which I don't at all. 

Megan...who lives in Cam. doesn't go to my school and I never get to hang out with her. But like every time we hang out every now and then. things just go back to how they always are.

And Hannah who went to school with me last year. But you know what. I Feel like the worst friend ever. Last year I wanted to go to a completely new school. to get new friends and new everything. Which seemed like it would work out good until Hannah showed up at the same school as me. So I sorta singled her out and didn't really hang out at her at all. Which is prolly the meanest thing I have ever done to a friend. I was so scared about what people would think about me and what not that I forgot what was really important. But seriously I wish I could get her to come back to Buena. It would just be me and her. No one else. I don't care if everyone else thinks she is a freak. she is my best friend and if they don't like it tough. I need her and I know she needs me. And it works out that we never have any time for each other and it doesn't make since. every time I see her just around Ventura I swear I can see it in her eyes. She needs someone and im never there. and I hate it. I love her so much. and seriously she is part of who I am. and I just feel really shitty about everything that has gone on with us in the last four years. we both have been through so much and I just really feel for her and I wish things could be different. 

ha whoa. well this is a very long entry. but very needed. I never have anyone that I really can talk to anymore who has the time for me. and I have a feeling that as soon as I find a place to hang out by my self. im going to be a serious loner. I don't really care. I don't like really any of the people at my school and yeah. there is no one that i really just want to hang out with so im not going to bother.

I'll keep my mouth kept shut from under lock and key

Drinking champagne from a paper cup

A sad-sorry state, stutter step to those slammin' grooves

"event","i just realized i think the reason why i party and get drunk so much is that i really have nothing better to do. if i had a boyfriend i think i would be spending so much time with him every nite and weekend that there really would not be all this time to party and be stupid. wich i would like a lot better b/c all this sneaking out and what not is really getting to me. i dunno. i wanna be a good kid hahaha im tired of that party life. i guess its a good thing that school will be starting up soon b/c i really cant go on like this. i seriously love and hate going to 82. but im only going this sunday for the hope that ryan will be going. i wish i could just give up on him but this week has been such crap and i kno once im with him it will all go away and i will be able to get away for the nite and feel like i always feel when im with him. bah but i should not be saying this b/c i kno that with my luck things wont work out and he wont end up going. and i dunno. im stuck on what i want to do tonight. there is this thing going on up in santa barbara but im not sure if i can get drunk again. just like every friday, i used to drink and party b/c it was fun. but sadly iv become very depressed and i just dont think its for all the same reasons anymore. i dunno. i needed to get that out, i guess since ihave really no one to talk to this shit about anymore is the reason why i prolly just started writing in my LJ aagain. someone call me tonight or something,i really need someone to talk to.

like i just cant seem to do anything right anymore


i would hate to be some emo loser talking about there stupid love life that never works out and how so many more things in there life suck and they want to kill them selves b/c thats not wat im feeling. but i am lonely. and i do miss my ex. and i feel like all i ever do is party or sit around at my house an just hang out b/c im so tired. i want a new life style. im not sure what but something has to change. i just need someone in my life. i want someone i can call at 2 in the morning when i need someone just to talk to. i need someone to hold me an hug me an kiss me and tell me not to worry anymore b/c iv found what i wanted and they promise me with all there heart that they are not going to hurt me. i kno im young....but. i want to fall in love. i want so many things from guys that i know i am not getting. and i kno it will all happen with time. but what about the time inbetween. what do u do then. be sad. are u better off just crying ur eyes out and being sad for how ever long it takes to get over someone or do u need to get back in the game and find a new guy to take ur mind off the old? this year has been the worst for me with love and guys and im just at a point were im really confused as to what i should do with my self and if i do find a great guy (if thats possible) should i take that leap again and put my heart out hoping he is going to keep it and never let it go? b/c everytime i seem to do that....i get my heart thrown rite back into my chest, crushed and broken. And im not sure if i can deal with onemore heartbreak. I remember saying that right b4 i found ryan and i guess dealing with one more heartbreak was possible but i dont want it to be. i dont want it to happen. all i want is just to be with someone who makes me happy. who makes me laugh so hard that i feel like im gonna pee my pants. i want a boy who is not only my love but my best friend. i dont want my relationship to be filled with all this b/f g/f stuff. normal things to...like best friends do. i thought i had that but i guess i was wrong. like always. i guess im just really lonely...again. but ill get over it. ill move on an find a new guy. but most likely with all my luck iv had this year. ill get hurt again b/c im a dumb ass and always take that extra step in the relationship an let my heart run wild with emotions and then get shut down into nothing. and btw fuck all of u who even think for a second that im just some stupid girl going through stupid boy problems. everyone goes through it and even tho some of u do not write it out online dose not mean u dont feel it or u just dont care. u would have to be pretty fucking heartless to tell me what i am going through is something that u have never been through and wrote about. b/c im sure more than half of us have. ah im just in the crappyest mood. today was so bad. i dunno i was really upset i guess an fuck i sat like in the kitchen all day eating food and watching TV. i guess this all started with outback jack tho. for any of u who watch that. oh man. that guy is so good looking and when he voted off that girl....i dont kno her name. iv never watched the show b4. but u could tell that she really really did care for him and had the most worried face out of the other 2 girls and when said her name...oh man i could not help my self but to cry just as hard as she did. it was so sad. jack even started to cry. ah haha im the worst. i cry over everthing. im such a little girl. ya okay im done. i love who ever reads this crap and leaves me comments.

I guess the best thing that has happenend to me this summer was meeting and getting to kno ryan. The guy I was dating and am now not. I dunno long story why we broke up, an i guess u could say its been a little hard getting over him only b/c we still do tend to hang out from time to time and when we do ha we sure dont act like we are not together anymore. I dunno iv just never had anyone make me laugh like he dose. I seriously feel so stress free and happy around him. Wich is prolly why i miss hanging out with him because i seriously love who i am with him. Im so happy and i dunno loving life. We went to d-land not to long ago an ha iv never had such a wonderful day with a guy. Just me an him the whole day and nite. I dunno i just had so much fun being with him and i still do when we hang out but i seriously miss him an what we have done in the last month. And even tho i kno i can not hold onto him an i need to let everything go. I am really happy i met him. Hes one of the few who puts me into such a happy mood. Other than ryan...um all iv done is party and go to shows. Thats about it...ha that and shopping. But thats something i always do. Well ya i just thought i would update this old thing. I love you all who read this bull shit and even care what i have to say.

I feel like all I ever do is bitch about not having someone. Witch is dumb. But im just really sick of always hanging out with friends an having everyone go off with there b/f.g/f and me being stuck with no one. so ya um if there are any boys out there who wanna treat me how i deserve to be treated, come and get me b/c im tired of waiting. but im not just about to throw my self out to every boy who says he likes me. iv done that one to many times an the only thing that comes out of that is a broken heart. i dunno. i don't want to settle for anything less than i deserve witch is why i really don't think i should rush things with anyone but then again im so lonely an miserable without someone special in my life. haha this is like so early morning talk show but i don't know. i just want to be loved. was that ever such a hard thing to ask for. i dunno iv just reached a real dry spot in my love life i guess. haha i dunno im dumb. but um this wednesday is my b-day so like send me money an cards an stuff haha. or gimme a call an wish me a happy bday<3 it would make my day. 8057664227. i love you bitches<3

"event","alright, so I kno everyone who reads this will either tell me im sorry or to hang in there b/c im young an ill find someone. Well fuck that haha im not looking for a soul mate or any shit like that. i just want a guy to love me an treat me like his queen. and although that is not much to ask, its hard to find. bahhh iv been so fucking pissed an hating guys this last mouth, iv just become totally bitter an i hate it. i want to have someone hold on hand an call me every time they wake up in the morning just to tell me they love me an im the first thing they thought of when they woke up. im just really lonely right now, an everyone needs someone. and it fucking sucks when you have no one. and having loving friends can only go so far. i think everybody knows that there is a big difference between friends an more than friends. but i dunno. i would hate to come off as some bitchy chick who just needs a dick between her legs b/c that is so NOT what im about. the last 6 months of this year have been shit for me and im just fucking sick of it. i don't need a guy to make me happy b/c im not depressed, but it dose get lonely having no one to be loved by an being able to love them back. i kno that everyone goes through this, an im sure ill find some kinda guy over summer but i hate waiting an not knowing what will happen next. the fact that the man im going to fall in love with one day is just like walking around, getting something to eat with friends, or he's at some party with his girlfriend is almost scary to me. its weird to kno that, that person is out there, he/she doesn't kno when or how or where its going to happen and neither do you. but all you kno is that the one person u might spend the rest of ur life with, is out having there own life without you till that one day you meet. but then again you might already kno the person you're going to fall in love with but it just has not happened yet. haha i dunno i sound like such a little emotional girl right now. but ha yea i sorta am, im to sensitive about things sometimes an im totally just like writing an writing about this, an i dunno. my love life just fucking sux balls right now an i hate it but there is nothing i can do about it. it just bothers me when i see couples like kissing an saying i love you an having pix of them like making out an shit. but im just jealous that i have none of it. and i think anyone else who gets pissed off for those same reasons is just as jealous as the next person. that's life though, jealousy is normal but i hate knowing that i get mad when i see my friends just trying to show love for each other. i should be happy for them an wish them the best. but no im just fucking jealous an angry. haha so yeah. i think im done for now, this is pretty fucking long haha but shit i have had really no one to talk to about this an i had to get it out some way. ill prolly put this in my LJ too b/c i never write in that shit anymore. but i love all of you who read this an i hope that everyone out there who has that special person in there life to love, an care for is happy. And knows how lucky they are to have someone who loves them as much as you love them. take care everyone<3

And um WHOA haha there was THE biggest hippie man I have ever seen in my life and I guess i was feeling a little sad sitting in the shop and I look over my shoulder and there is this hippie looking at me and he puts up both his hands and dose a peace sign with both of them with this big ass smile that made him look really smashed haha. So then once again im just minding my own business and I look outside and I see the hippie dancing like a mix between michelle jackson and elvis. HAHA oh man did he look funny...he like ripped open his button up shirt and did an elvis move and said ""VIVA LOS VEGAS!!!"" HAHAHA yeah I was laughing for hours about that. I even called hannah b/c haha me and her are way tight with the hippie folk. Haha oh man how, I love ojai some times.

"event","I dunno..I was feeling great, and then i just started to think about all last month with alex. And it really makes me feel crapy, i dunno as i can tell he has moved on to other girls and im still stuck in park. I just want someone to love me and treat me like there queen, but any kind of love is so hard to find. Even at my age, and yes i know i have a lot of time to work these things out but thats far away from now. Now is all that matters to me and well now is turing into never. I just want to kno wat it feels like to really mean it when you say I love you. That sounds soooo cheesy but haha its true. Im tired of being used and lead on. Men can be such pigs and ass holes. It truely makes me sick sometimes, 98% of them just want ass and dont realize you have feelings. And i know that I can be happy and I can live without a guy, but i feel like i cant. I guess thats wat makes this hard for me to get over every guy that hurts me. I know i dont need them to be happy...but I feel like i do. And im also sick of everyone around me with all there effing fantastic relationships. I guess im biter but like man..i love my lady megan to death<33 but she ALWAYS has a boyfriend, its just like whoa....can we switch shoes for a little? I dunno, my time will come that i have this amazing relationship that everyone will be jealous of...but I dont kno how much longer im willing to wait. Haha its not like i have much of a choice tho....anways im done bitchen...<333

"event","So I think I have come to the decision to not get serious or really like any kind of boy/guy/man/critter/pig/thing haha im soo over guys right now. I need a guy break..fuck I just need a break, I want to go on a vacation with my self and not worry about anything. I really need kortnee every one leave me the fuck alone time. Anyway what i was trying to get to was that..i can live my life with out a guy just like i have been doing, this whole Alex crap just got me off track. men are a waste of my time right now and are just going to get me into more shit than i already am. i just don't need to deal with my own bull shit and have to deal with some ones else's. if this is how Alex wants it then fuck it...he had his chance and it is gone. 

Haha yeah...Well my day was So So. i started my period, probably the reason why i am so bitchy rite now but yeah i hate Mondays. Today went decently fast though...thank god. then my sister picked me up with her boyfriend, iv never met him b4 but he's cool. then we had dinner with my mom, and then i watched the movie thirteen. Aww i cried haha it is sooo not a sad movie but i totally know what its like to go through all that stuff and it reminded me of my 7th and 8th grade years. But yeah tomorrow im hoping my Sammie baby will pimp out my LJ for me. Muawh love you hottiebutt<3 much love to all of yea other people who read this too. Nite Folks<33333Kort

"event","So once again..I am pissed off.

Blah maybe I have been looking to deep into life and just everything about it lately but nothing seems to be going right for me
1.guys....ahh shoot me already
2.friends haha laugh laugh laugh..maybe I need to be more open for new friend b/c yeah I don't do a good job at making them
3.ventura...ew I cant wait to move, I really wanted to stay for a wile only b/c of this one person but well that person has turned out to be an ass fuck so haha I am perfectly fine with moving out of this god forsaken town.

And I don't know, im probably being a big drama queen about this whole thing but I don't fucking care..and this is sorta off the subject but haha I hate it when people are like well look on the bright side blah blah blah...if I have a problem telling me that my problems are not that bad and that other people have it worse is going to do jack shit..haha in the end im still stuck with my problems and all you have done is piss me off even more. maybe haha I need to go to anger management b/c I don't know I get SOOO pissed off about these things. 

Needless to say, I need some kind of change in my boring life. Today...im off to the store to buy pool stuff, then me and my mom are driving down to saugus to go tan and swim at my aunties big ass pool for a wile then im going to meet this boy off of myspace...wish me luck!! Im gonna need it, me and men just don't mix haha but you know after all the heart break and tears I have shed for these stupid pigs I really just get stronger. So bring the ass holes on, ill rip them apart. Haha anyway in 2 years the guys that have hurt me now will be forgotten and hopefully I will never have to go through the shit I went through with them. Alrighty that's enough for today. much love &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

"event","Sooo yeah today was really just plane. I dont know this whole week has been going by so slow, I hate it. I just want to get out of school and not have to deal with all the homework and test and best of all the drama. Soooo hmm lemme see nothing really exiting happened at school other than me a joy hurrahing beckett but that happens everyday. I guess kisses are out and licking is in. And i started reading a book that really dose not make any sense to me......i dont know im going to read to page 20 and if i dont like it then ill just stop reading. that is going to be my new rule with books. haha i counted all the books i have read this year since January and my total was 8 books so i guess you could say i read a lot. but at least i do something good with my spare time. haha anyway im talking about a whole lot of nothing and if anyone is reading this you're really stupid b/c i would have stopped reading what I was writing after the first two words that came from my fingers. So im getting ready to go see princey and ill be back later....im hoping a special some one will give me a call but its doubtful, men are lame and stupid. The End

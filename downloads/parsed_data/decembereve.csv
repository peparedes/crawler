Akairyu, Red Team, took a solid defeat this afternoon. All cadets flew very well- we attribute this loss to the inexperience of the Red Team commander. Further progress reports can as always be retrieved at http://preventers.geneva.un/ . Please log into your accounts and update your information.

"event","Akairyu battled Shiroiryu last night at 0200 in an unscheduled training exercise.  Special mention should be given to Akairyu Heavy Support Element Two for their sound battlefield judgement and overall professional execution of orders.  Victory was declared by Shiroiryu 84 minutes after the onset of the engagement.

All cadets may examine their updated progress files at http://preventers.geneva.un/ after 1500 this same day.  Reassignments and promotions will also be posted.

This is a general announcement that weapons training will now cover use of armor-piercing anti-mobile suit shoulder weapons, for use in clandestine operations and guerilla warfare.  This new training module will involve field exercises.

There was a bomb in my room today.  How strange."

Foreign Minister Darlian now has her own journal, <lj user=""foreignminister"">.  Those that are politically-minded may enjoy this look into the life of a government official.

Duo's modifications to the simulator were satisfactory, though there are several issues that I would like to address in regards to mobile suit movement and projectile physics.  In addition, the acoustics have obviously been...'altered'.

Foreign Minister, if you are reading this, you have an appointment this weekend in New York City.  Details will be supplied over e-mail."

I am fascinated by the tactical aspects of a game of checkers.

I know you're reading this.  Are you going to finish the simulator this time?  I saw you programming in some kind of soundtrack.  I'm going to assume it had something to do with the ambient noise involved with mobile suit combat.  I'm also going to assume I'm incorrect.

I went shopping with the foreign minister last week.  I am still bothered by it.

That's all."

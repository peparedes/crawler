"event","I miss camp so much, I miss everyone
from camp<3 I miss feeling the most
comfortable I've ever felt sleeping
away from home. I miss not worring
about what people think of me all
the time, because i know that
dosnt matter to anyone there. ive
never met so many good hearted
caring loving people in one
place. I wish everyone could just
live at camp all year, that would
make me so happy, i wouldnt worry
about trying to impress anyone
or about stupid drama. Everything
is okay when im there, and i just
want to be there right now because
nothing is right. 
And why does everyone from camp have
to live so damn far away. goddamnit.
another small camp reunion should happen
again soon<3<3<3

sick, i wish i had one person i could
count on all the time, that would drop
everything for me, but thats selfish and
i wouldnt want to be selfish now would i?

and its not working because whatever
i want/need means someones going to be
upset with it so i dont get anything,
and yet no one is happy? what the fuck
am i doing wrong?
sowhatthfuckshouldido?
and dont tell me to not try and make everyone
happy because thats just what i do. 
dont tell me to not appologise for stuff
i shoulnt appologise for because if im 
saying sorry theres a reason. so stfu.

i cant even deal with school, wtf is
going on here.

i think i need time to think what
im going to do with myself over
the next year, what that is i 
have no fucking idea.

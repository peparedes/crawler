So, everyone will be coming over today.. I think I'm gonna lock myself in my room and watch a movie after I eat. That seems like it'd be the best thing to do lol, but then again... all the little kids will be sad that I'm not playin with them.. so I dunno. Maybe a rousing game of tag outside or something like we ususally do first, THEN a movie and a nap. Sounds like a plan, doesn't it?

Let's see... I still have to take a shower and stuff... then finish picking up the remnants of the random clutter in my room. I'll start at 11:30, everyone's to be here at 12, but that really means 1 or 1:30 lol.

Well, that's it for now. Peace bitches."

Not too much has really been goin on lately.. I've spent a lot of my time online, talkin to someone about anything and everything.  I look forward to talkin with her, it's fun, I don't think I've ever met anyone(male or female) with a sense of humor as close to mine as hers is.  So, it just makes it that much more fun!  She's a cutie too, she better watch out ;-)

One of my parents friends is stayin with us for a few days while him and his wife go through some problems. Originally, I thought this would be weird, but it's like he's not even here. I think that disappoints me more, because I can honestly say he's like my second father. I go to him for advice and he seeks me out to give me advice, like he once heard of me and one of my exes goin out and breakin up like every couple days. It took what he said to me to get me outta that cycle of stupidity, not what my real parents said lol. This guy is someone who looks at me like a son too, prolly because he has like 8 kids and the last three are the only boys... and they're all still too young to really do anything(I think the oldest is like 4th/5th grade) with, but yeah. I dunno, I know my dad gets jealous when I spend too much of my time with this guy too, so I gotta be careful... last thing I need is to be in the middle of another argument, as I always seem to be around here.  lol, 'cause I'm the troublemaker and everything. I'm worthless, duh, that's what I'm told anyways lol.

Oh yeah, Kylie, you're still holding my book hostage! I swear, the Marines are on their way to rescue it for me... especially since it belongs to my brother! He's not as small as he once was man, he's bigger than me now... and he's only 15... he might even be able to kick my ass now(though, I doubt it.. highly doubt it), I just don't wanna find out! :-p"

"event","Well, another weekend has past, and it has been exactly what I said it would be. Pretty damned awesome. I think it's been the best weekend in a while, aside from a couple others that just can't be topped. Let's see:

Friday-
Woke up late as hell, talked online for a bit... Went out with Tim and Coral to some party, it was lame, so we left and went over to Tommy's house, where everyone proceeded to get fucked up, and ramble on about things such as porn and kettle corn. We then watched XXX and promptly ordered 3 pizzas. Yummy. Pizza. Then I took Tim and Coral back to her house, leading me back home around midnight to get some much needed sleep.

Saturday-
Woke up with a headache. I wonder why. Anyways, Spent most of the day at home, watching TV and stuff, then I headed out to the mall with Tim to meet David on his break. Talked to Kayla and that one girl at the watch company, then went to meet David at Bergner's. Ate, took Tim home and dropped David back off. Went to Tommy's again with Tara and Branden this time. Smoked, played Phase 10, and ate kettle corn lol. Then we ordered more pizza, and watched TV. At like 10:30 I met David up though and went to the High Dive, where drinking ensued and dancing proceeded to get better with each drink lol. Went to the after party, chilled, talked, danced more. Went home after to sleep until about noon.

Sunday-
Stayed at home, relaxed and watched TV all day. The best Sunday I've had in a while. I didn't have to do anything.

Which is why I'm bored today and will be out again, updates on that later."

"event","This weekend is gonna kick ass.. I will be drunk, I will be happy, and I will be drunk... oh wait, I mentioned that already huh? Well, it is true. Muahahaha. Best thing is, I don't have to drive anywhere either! Hoo-Ha! Got a ride and everything! Wow, I sound... almost sorta kinda responsible. Damn. That sucks.

Nothin really exciting goin on right now, just been chillin with all my friends and stuff. What I do every day. The only difference from last time was that I went to Bergner's to talk to David at work and then I ended up talkin to Katrina and Munnie for a while, then to David for a minute... then I talked to Olena, because I love her and she's really a nice girl, I talk to her for hours at a time. We were just talkin about how much Bergner's sucks and then Stephanie(this really big ""princess"" girl that I hate) keeps walkin in my line of vision to get me to say hi to her and I just kinda looked at her and leaned over and whispered to Olena ""I'm gonna go now though, I really don't like Steph at all and she's right there."" ....I guess Steph heard me lol, because she kinda jaw-dropped and walked away really fast. Serves her right. Fuckin princess gets on my nerves. When I worked there she always was like ""Chris, do something"" and ""My mom's the store manager in Quincy"".. I was just trying not to strangle her. She's a dumb sorority girl man, and not sayin sorority girls are dumb, but she makes the stereotype a fact with herself. Damn.

Well, that's all that's happened of interest, I'll definitely have stories after tonight and tomorrow night though, be prepared. Love ya'll."

Drinkin' beer on the back of the tailgate
Boys from the valley wanna start a fight
Hey baby, what you wanna do tonight?
The only fear a rebel heart knows 
Nothin' to do and anything goes

Looking back on those days of thunder
Shake my head and I have to wonder
How we ever made it through that
Every night you're taking me back
Desert road and a restless wind
Ain't it good to feel that way again
Here we are the way we were
In those days of thunder

That ole Ford is sure fast on the draw
Out gunned the Chevys and out run the law
Outskirts of town looking down on the light
Waitin' for some kind of lightening to strike
The cars and the bars 
And the songs we knew had changed
The fire burns the site of her still remains

"event","Well, two in a row? Aren't ya'll lucky?

My uncle, I guess, has resigned to the fact that he is going to die... or my dad may have resigned to that fact. He told me last night with tears in his eyes and his voice cracked. But, like so many times before, my father hid it with anger and immediately lashed out at everyone later on. I hate that, but then again, I pride myself in being able to hide things like he does... I guess it's a double-edged sword. I'm just glad I don't lash out at people in anger when something's bothering me. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I did that.

Also, my uncle is going to talk to everyone. I already know what the talk is going to be about, as my dad has told me. He's gonna ask us all not to follow down his path and stay away from drugs and alcohol... and I will listen to him with respect, the respect that he has earned for being able to quit drugs and alcohol and make amends within the family. My family, that was torn apart because of it... it's sad to see that a tragedy has to bring us together, everyone has so much pride, it's dangerous it seems. I have no idea what my reaction is going to be to his speech... I can't say if I will quit anything or not, I just know that I'm seriously thinking about it. It can happen anyone and I know this, I'm not gonna be thinking ""Oh, this will never happen to me, I'm smarter than that"", because I know better. I'm mature enough to know that it can happen to anyone at any time. Now, it's time to see what direction I choose to take. I'm scared, I'll admit, because I don't want to become addicted to any of the things my uncle did, and go through what he did. I also feel a need to prove myself to myself again and show myself that I have self-control and that I won't become addicted. It's gonna be hard though, addictions to drugs and alcohol do run on my dads side of the family, and quite possibly my moms side, but no one knows anything about that.

I'm just hoping that I can be strong, and keep my head straight... with whatever I choose to do. Who knows? The only way to find out is once I make my decision. Whatever that is, I hope it's the right one.

I just hope Norman will be proud of whatever I do, and I hope that he will be able to look down on me. I believe he deserves Heaven, he may have done some horrible things in his life, but to look at him now and see how he's tried to fix things the best he could... I think that shows that he deserves to be let in. I love him, I've never said it to his face, but maybe I should.."

"event","So, I found out that my Uncle Norman needs a liver transplant to live, and even if he gets it his chances of survival are slim. I mean, I know it's his fault for being addicted to alcohol and so many drugs, but still... he's been doing good for a lot of years since then... I guess you can't beat something you already have. Hepatitis C and all that.. fuckin heroin... fuckin crack! I wish he'd have been smarter than that, so we could still take our fishing trips and stuff. I know I bitched about takin him places, but in reality, I loved takin him places to give me a chance to hang out with him. He just started treating me like an adult too, it's really annoying that now he might not have a chance to live. All I can do is pray for him.

So yeah, it's got me thinkin'... I might have to re-evaluate some of my extracurricular activities."

"event","When the FUCK did everyone decide it was ok to get cold?! I freakin hate cold weather, the only good thing about winter is wrestling season and that doesn't even start until November!

A suprising way to start a new update, but I'm tired of wakin up cold as fuck lol.. So, within the past two weeks, I've gone to two homecoming dances. They were alright, I had hella more fun at Urbana's than Fisher's though... Marissa was definitely a better date... though I'm sure Fisher's woulda been more fun if I knew more than two people lol.  

I haven't talked to Leah(Fisher girl), since like 2 days after the dance, we didn't get along very well it seems. But during pictures and dinner she was all about talkin to me and shit lol. I dunno, I shouldn't have went with her because I knew it would happen that way, but I woulda felt bad if she had no date, you know what I'm sayin? Then we started hanging out and stuff and kissed a few times... but, eh, I forgot that kissing doesn't necessarily mean anything to anyone anymore. *Shrugs* Doesn't matter though, at least I don't have to listen to Leah talk like she's 5 years old anymore and pretend to think it's cute.

So, Urbana's homecoming was hella more fun. We went to eat at El Toro's before the dance and then we went to the dance at like... oh... 9-ish I think? 9:30 maybe... And Marissa just started goin crazy with the dancing lol It was fun though, I liked it. Afterwards we went to a couple different places, then Marissa had to go home and I just decided to meet David and everyone at High Dive around 1, then we all took off from there back to Joo's place... the night was more eventful, but I don't wanna type it all out and stuff, so you're gonna have to deal with the bare-boned explanation... Sowwy :-(

I think that is all... you are dismissed."

Anyways, it has been a long time, but I've been busy working and stuff... well, not working anymore, yesterday was my last day, so now I have to find a new job here soon... or else I'm screwed lol.

David and I are lookin for places to live now, we decided to get an apartment together this Spring prolly, if not sooner, ya know? About time we got out on our own we figured.

I'm going to Fisher's homecoming dance this weekend... I dunno how that's gonna be, but at least Leah's a girl I like, ya know? I didn't say yes just because I'd feel bad for sayin no, I actually wanted to go with her. I dunno what you'd call us though... boyfriend/girlfriend... I dunno, it's complicated to figure out. We decided that for as long as we're together though,  we're gonna have fun, we're not gonna be lame lol.. my last few relationships have gotten lame over time and we both dont want that to happen... so we'll see how it goes.

Ummm... nothin else new really, just been chillin'. Find me a job someone!"

I re-learned something too, that I had forgotten. I need to remember to not fall for certain types of girls. Gotta remember that, it's gonna save me one day. Good thing I remembered it before that party tonight on campus, damn.. it was a blast. The tenant of room #34, I owe a thank you to, once again.. without him and his generosity, things couldn't have happened tonight. He's definitely not a cheap ass cock block. The only thing I regret is doing it out of spite and not for a better reason.

I guess I'm an asshole now, and mean, too. That's what I've been told today anyways. Fuck that, I had a reason to act how I did and you know it. I figured it would happen anyways.

I might be in a bad mood all around, because my grandma recently had a heart attack too. So yeah, if I'm kinda pissy the next couple days, it's 'cause certain girls really really piss me off and my grandma almost died. Alright? Good deal? I thought so too."

Nothing really is going on, I'm just working and going out as always. I'm taking a semester off of school and then going back this Spring. I think it'll really help me out, I need to know what I want to do, and I've got more time to think about it now and it's really helping me already. The only bad thing is, I don't get to see everyone all the time, but it's ok, this is what I have to do now. For myself.

Well, there's someone who likes me now and I like her, but wow.. it's complicated. I like her a lot, and yes I want to date her.. but I dunno if I can stop being selfish to do it. I mean selfish as in ""I'm used to doing what I want to do, when I want to do it"".. eventually that will stop in a relationship, but I've been avoiding relationships for so long, I don't know if I wanna give up my 'freedom'. I will, eventually, I know that... I do anything to make people happy and keep them that way, even if it's no benefit to myself.

Other news... not really anything. Thursday night at the High Dive with David and everybody else. Prolly gonna be crunk, prolly gonna be dancin, etc. Pretty much the usual, ya know?

I work tomorrow from 6-9, and then again Friday 7-10, but that's about it. Weak ass work week. No money gonna come my way. Shit.

David should  be on his way back home from Purdue, I think if I don't hang out with someone, I'll go over there to his house and kick it there for a little while. Then come home and sleep. Get up tomorrow and weed eat, and finish cleaning my room and stuff. Then work, then whatever I wanna do. Sweet.

Marissa stopped by tonight with Linnea. I've missed Marissa, she's so sweet, cute and fun to be around. She knows how to make me laugh, which isn't the easiest thing to do in the world, especially with how things are goin at home right now. I love that girl, seriously, she's been a big part of my life since I met her a while back. There was a time when we always hung out and it was great, I didn't even have to be dating her or anything, she was that great of a girl to be considered a really good, one-a my best, friends. I liked her once, a while back(Ok, so what if I might still? fuck you! lol) too, but nothin happened on that one lol... not like I expected it to back then, no confidence in myself, figured she was too good for this poor ol' white boy lol :-p I'm gonna kick it with her this weekend, Saturday night prolly, it's gonna be much-needed fun times. Oh yes.

Speakin of fun times and such, I got a new AOL IM... I still get on my old one too, but this one is the better one.. it's:

Seriously, if you think I'm hot, keep it to yourself if you have a boyfriend. I'm tired of it."

"event","So, I've been kinda slackin on the updates lately... my bad everyone, I get too busy and then I forget about this thing. Yes, I know I suck lol

Anyways, yesterday I went to work from 10-645 and I kicked major ass in sales. I ended up with 1268.97 total... combine that with me 1152.00 Thursday, and I made over 200 bucks of commission in two days... so my check should be blingin' good next week. Imma be loaded! Hell yeah! lol.. work wasn't even bad either, I was busy all day and me and David decided to go to someone's birthday bbq and then go to the High Dive with everyone afterwards too. So after David got offa work, we went to my house and I was changing into club clothes, and Tim walks in my door, askin me if I'm ready to hang out. I was like what the hell? Then Tim was like I left you a message, so I told him I didn't get it, which was true... the fucker would try to get me to ditch David by tellin me I was gonna be kickin it with Kailee, but my word is something I try to stick by, so I went with David, like I said.

We went to the bbq, where I had a few beers and ate some good ass food, and played Spades for dollars.. I kicked ass, 5 bucks! Any takers? Haha, me and David are killer! Then Alisa thought she could wrestle me, so I had to shut her down... by then it was 11 and time to roll to the club. We went out there and I had a couple Rum and Cokes, which were straight rum with just enough coke to turn it brown. It was a good burn lol.. then everyone tried to get me to dance, so I was like ""No! White boy! White boy!"" , but after about an hour of everyone messin with me, I went out to the floor with Alisa and tore it up. Now they can't say I don't/can't dance... fuckers. I was gonna dance with Joanna too, but she and I were just fuckin around, doin stupid shit, so Alisa made me dance with her the rest of the night. It was fun.

Then we went back to the house for a while and chilled, ate Taco Bell, and then David was like ""Curfew! Gotta go home!"" lol, so we left and I came home and slept... which brings me to now, waitin until 2:45 for David to get here, so we can kick it. That's about all guys, peace out!"

(JOE DIFFIE)

A little boy walks in with a bloody nose
got beat up on his way home from school...
again!
His dad caught him runnin out the back,
tears in his eyes and a baseball bat.
oohooh revenge!
Said ""Son I won't stop you but before you go,
let me tell you a little story bout the 
toughest man I know.

They hit him and he just turned the other cheek
Don't think for a minute, he was weak
Cuz in the end, he showed them, 
he was anything but frail...
They hammered him to a cross
but he was tougher than nails.

Well he dropped that bat like it weighed a ton
father put his arms around his son and said..
just let it go...
Believe me I've been in your shoes
had to ask myself ""What would Jesus do""
and here's what I know.
Whenever I'm in doubt I look up what he said
it's all there in the good book
in black and white and red.

They hit him and he just turned the other cheek

Yeah in the end, he showed them

IN ANOTHER WORLD
(JOE DIFFIE)

Thumb stuck high in the air
Destination anywhere 
This road decides to go
Underneath the desert sky
I find a place to hide and rest my weary bones
This underpass will shade the heat
As my mind drifts off to sleep...

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world

A car stops way up ahead
I climb inside her hair is red
I thank her for the ride
She talks the miles away
I nod and smile and try to say
Anything to be polite
But as the darkness ends the day
Another voice whisper's my name

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight (beautiful sight)
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world

"event","Hey everyone, just postin before work because I'm bored as hell and there ain't shit to do. It sucks, but you gotta play with the hand you're dealt in life.. my hand right now sucks ass, and it was doin so damn good before. Ok, enough Poker analogies, you can prolly tell I was just watchin the World Series of Poker on TV. I just love the game and that show... if I had 10 grand, I'd enter that bitch, lose all my money and come home sayin ""dude, I played in the ESPN poker tournament!"" ...That's me, a bright side to everything ya know?

I'm just chillin right now, thinkin again... I seem to do most of my serious thinkin while chillin.. go figure. Makes me think that I think too much, and don't just let things play out, I'm always trying to stay ahead of the game and it sometimes burns me, but sometimes it works and I feel like I outsmarted life. Impossible, I know, but it's a good feeling. But yeah, Tim's girlfriend has taken in upon herself to try to hook me up with people again, but she's not too good at it... I mean, I hit it off with the last girl she had me talk to, but then again I've never met her and only talked to her once, and she seems to be talkin to another guy at the same time. Not that it bothers me, but I don't feel the need to compete for someone, ya know? I'm too laid back, and I can get under someone's skin so easily, it's no fun for me.. and the other dude always ends up wantin to fight, and then I either have to go and fight him, or just talk my way outta it if he's 3 times my size.. and either way I usually win, but I have taken my beatings, though I'm usually fine the next day. I can take a punch to the jaw and shrug it off, comes from my dad and I boxing for fun, he hits harder than most people I will ever meet.. and he holds back. But yeah, still on the relationship thing, some girl named Kailee that Britt wants to hook me up with.. then some girl named Jen that I met a couple weeks ago and she calls me about every day... I just wish it'd be simple, ya know? I've never had this much trouble picking or getting into a relationship with someone, so it's new to me. There are also about 3 or 4 girls that like me too, but I don't talk to them much or get to see them that much... gah! Confusing and annoying. That's about the best way to put it.

In other news, I'm gettin a cell phone and a new computer soon, so my parents must be thinkin I'm doin something right, even though they can't stop bitching at me for five seconds. You'd think they'd  give it a rest when they realised that I wave them off like I don't hear them, and still do what they tell me to do, just on my time, not theirs. They don't own my time anymore and they can't deal with it. I work and I'm still deciding about school, if I go I go, but P-Land was nice enough to extend my dates to see if classes were what I wanted right now, or if I just needed a break from school and I'd go back the next semester. We'll see. My parents jsut can't deal with the fact that I have a life, and it mostly doesn't include the family, because I DONT FIT INTO MY FAMILY! Not at all! I don't like anything they like, I don't like to go to family outings and I like to do my own thing. They hate my piercing, my tattoo(even though pops signed the paper for it), and they're really gonna hate it when I get my tongue pierced. But hey, I'm 19, I don't HAVE to be here... I'm here outta my own free will.. I'm here because if I weren't, they'd fall apart and they know it. My dad is the voice of power and fear, my mom the voice of reason, and my brother is the smartass. While I'm the balance. Without me, they'd implode on each other, the threats to kick me out are as empty as the tones they use when they tell me they will kick me out. Like it or not, without me, my immediate family would be a broken one.

Well, that's about all I got for now, I'll post later tonight on how well work goes and whatever else I do tonight. Love ya'll, eat your veggies!"

"event","Answer the following questions using the lyrics of one artist/band. 

Montgomery Gentry

1. Are you male or female? 

It's a free fall when your back's against the wall
When you hit rock bottom and the bottom drops out
How's a man supposed to stand tall
Well, the high life ain't my life
I can't walk a line and I damn sure ain't gonna crawl
Just living in a free fall

2. Describe yourself: 

I ain't gonna spare the rod
Cuz that ain't what my daddy did
And I sure know the difference between wrong and right
You know, to me it's all just common sense
A broken rule, a consequence
You do your thing, I'll do mine

Hey, I'll worry about me
You just worry about you
And I'll believe what I believe
And you believe what you believe too

I'm gonna keep on working hard
Make my money the old-fashioned way
I don't wanna piece of someone else's pie
If I don't get my fill on life I ain't gonna blame no one but me
You do your thing, I'll do mine

You ain't gonna be my judge
Cuz my judge will judge us all one day
You do your thing, I'll do mine

3. Describe your boyfriend/girlfriend: 

She's gone!
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone



4. How do they feel about you? 

She changed her mind when she couldn't change me.

5. How do you feel about yourself? 

My hard head, the cigarettes and straight Kentucky Bourbon 
Have taken their toll and done their best to do me in 
Guitars and beer joint bars up and down the highway 
If I could start all over, I'd do it all again  

With all of life's temptations 
And this dream that I've been chasin' 
It's a wonder I ain't long since dead and gone 
I've cheated undertakers, dang near met my maker 
I'm tellin' ya'll I'm lucky to be here at all  

And when I die I'll thank the good Lord face to face 
For his patience and grace  

6. What would you rather be doing? 

Well the party started early 
About a quarter to three 
Just a few close friends 
Charlie, Troy, and me 
We just got started when somebody asked 
How long you think this party's gonna last? 

I said all night long (all night long) 
I said all night long (all night long) 
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'  
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long 

7. Describe where you live: 

(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is my town 
(Nana na na na)
Yeah Where I was born  
Where I was raised  
Where I keep all my yesterdays 
Where I ran off cause I got mad  
And it came to blows with my old man 
Well I came back and settled down 
This is where they'll put me in the ground 
Yeah this is My town 
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is My town 
(Nana na na na)
My town

8. Describe how you love: 

Yeah, been drivin' like I'm struck by lightin'
I think about you and I start to speed
I might as well be playin' with matches
In a trailerload of gasoline

If it's the last thing I do
If it takes me from Tupelo to Timbuktu
If it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna dodge every roadblock, 
Speed trap, county cop
To get my hands on you
If it's the last thing I do
If it's the last thing I do
If it's the last thing I do

9. Share a few words of wisdom: 

young kid steps in from the cold
he ordered up a drink
he says don't look surprised old man 
I'm older than you think
if I was the talking kind
I could tell you a thing or two
and since you didn't ask
let me show you my tattoos

he said I got this rose in memphis
in some back old alley dump
picked this eagle up in dallas
man I sure was good and drunk
and you know the way I see it
if it gets any worse out there
a guy like me hasn't got a prayer

the old man poured some coffee
he said this one's on me
set down his cigarette
and rolled up his sleeve
said take a good look here my friend
do you see what these are
just my ragged old and jagged old and faded scars

he said I got this one in paris 
in a war 'fore you were born
and this one when I was half your age 
working on my daddy's farm
and u know the way I see it
son you ain't what I seen
'cause tattoos and scars are different things

he said I've been here for all these years 
and what I know is this
if you look and listen close a man will show you what he is
and you know the way i see it
you've been 'round, but you're still green
'cause tattoos and scars are different things

10. Say goodbye:

This ain't no temporary, typical, tearful goodbye
Uh uh uh
This ain't no breakin' up, then wakin' up and makin' up one more time
Uh uh uh
This is gone, gone, gone, gone"

"event","So today, I did absolutely nothing and accomplished absolutely nothing. A good day if you ask me, the only way to spend your days off. Though tonight I'd rather I'd have gone out, but it's not so bad stayin home, aside from my dad ranting at everyone every 5 seconds, I guess it's bearable. Though I do get cabin fever way too easily... to the point where I take a walk to get out. It's a disease I tell ya lol

So, that was my day, nothin exciting... well, aside from the fact that I've been doing some thinking lately. I know, hella suprising, it suprised me too! But I was thinking about how every time I'm goin to start dating someone, I find something to keep from doing it or I do something stupid and ruin it, or even do something with another girl... I think it's like a subconcious aversion to having a girlfriend. Like I'm afraid of the commitment, which really isn't true if I think even harder about it. I don't think I'm good enough for anyone anymore, I let myself get ruined to the point to where I had to find myself again, and after all that.. I know who I am now, and I don't think anyone should want me. I feel like I'm not good enough. That's the truth, straight from my mouth... er... fingers lol

I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette now. Third one of the day. Record low for me, go figure."

"event","Today sucked... work from 1:30-10:15 and then I went to David's to cop and then back home, so I can leave with Tim like I'm supposed to right? Well, it all goes smooth and we're goin down the road, and Tim goes ""We have to take the girls home and then we can only kick it for 45 minutes"" I was like ""What the fuck?! I'm 19, I kick it for hours at a time, not some shitty ass 45 minutes!"" So I made them take me home, I don't need to waste my fuckin time on shit like that, it pisses me off. That better not happen again, or Tim'll be struck for rides home when he's with me, because I sure as hell do go outta my way to get him home on time when he has to be home, if I kept track, he would owe me about 200 or more dollars in gas money. He should just consider himself lucky I don't charge gas money, 'cause I could very well and he knows it. I might start now that he has a job, and as payback for tonight.

I've decided to get my tongue pierced, methinks. I can always take it out if I don't like it, so I'm gonna do it. Then after that, I'm gonna get my second tattoo. Then I'm done maiming my body lol

Um... what else? I really dunno, I'm kickin it hard tomorrow night. I know that much I gotta make up for tonight... Man, Wednesday seems so far away and that's when my car goes in to the shop.. damn. Time needs to speed up."

"event","Forgot to tell ya'll... I can't really kick it anymore for like... a while. My car's brakes went out yesterday morning and pops is a dick about driving his truck. So I can use his truck to go to work and back, but not for anything else. Which is gay. And the car doesn't get fixed until next Wednesday... which is even worse.. 'cause now I gotta have rides to EVERYTHING... it's like ""What the fuck? I'm not 15 am I?"" ...Pisses me off.

Last night was tight, went to Lava with Kenny and Branden, had a couple beers. I had a rum and coke also, and Branden had a Yager Bomb. Then we went back to some girls apartment... it was the girl who pierced my ear! I was like ""What the fuck is up kid?!"" lol, it was so damned random! Had jello shots and kicked it until like 3:45, I got home at like 4:15... it was a very good night, lemme tell you what.

Speaking, don't forget my poll! I need more than 5 answers on if I should get the tongue pierced or not!

"event","I dunno.. things are goin so fast these days. I never seem to have the time to update properly and I never remember enough to make a good entry, so we'll just start from scratch and talk about what's goin on with me. Deal? Deal!

Work:
Work is goin ok, I make good money and I like most of the people I work with... especially David and Michele, they're my favorites, David is one of my best friends and Michele is just a great person to be around. She always has cool stories to tell too, I actually like listening to her talk about her man and her son(who is cute as hell, btw... all you 3 year olds better watch out when he hits 13, he's gonna be a lady killer)!  My manager left us, so we're kinda bein told what to do by other people now, it's wierd though. I miss people who leave after I just start to get to know them, I feel like I may have missed out on something, ya know?

School:
I registered for my classes and have to go out to P-Land tomorrow for other stuff... one of my classes is an Education class where I get to observe at a high school, I just need help picking one to observe at. There are hella choices, like 4,...Unity, Centennial, Urbana, or Mahomet. I like all four schools... I just dunno which one to pick is all lol.

Life:
Life is goin alright, I'm havin fun, but really me and my parents lack communication. I'm doing my best to keep lines open, but we hardly talk and stuff and when we do, we seem to be disinterested in whatever the other is saying. I guess it's part of growing up and them losing their first child to the real world. I dunno, I do know they worry about me though and want me to be happy and safe. They do a lot for me, even if we bitch at each other a lot lol. I also seem to have went from not liking anyone and wanting to be single... to liking about 349574976509479759074392590 girls at once and now not being able to make any choices. Gah, why can't life be simple?

Oh, and a Poll:
Should I get my tongue pierced? I've been thinkin about it...

"event","So, last night I decided it was time to go to Wednesday night Lava... I ended up goin with Heather, at first it was line dancing and there was this old guy out there break dancing! It was so funny! This dude was all into it too, he had to take off his overshirt and cowboy hat! He was gettin serious! lol

So Heather and I just chilled and drank a few drinks together and around midnight they played her type of music, so we went down and danced, we were both drunk lol... it was fun times. Then I finally got to meet her boyfriend, dude is tight and so are all his friends. Basically the rest of the night consisted of talkin with the guys and dancin with all the hot ladies... everyone was some kind of drunk and dancing was a little interesting ;-) At 2 though, it was time to go home... sadly. I'm goin next week, if you're 19 and wanna go, hit me up!

Today I work 4-close, then I'm goin to Tolono for Abby's party! Yay!

Tomorrow I open at 9:30 and work until 6, then I'm changin and goin out to the fair for the demos.. I wish I had time to get my car ready so I could drive in them again, but I just worked too much. So I'm doin the next TK Wendl's derby.

Saturday is work 11-6, then the demos again. Then out hopefully. Hit me up this week, if ya wanna kick it!"

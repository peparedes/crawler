"event","There is one man in my life, 
hes black and hes white, 
hes gracefull and sweet, 
his whiskers, so fine about his face.
His walk, so quiet and sleek.
his touch, it feel so soft.
My secrets, he never tells.
He holds his head up high, 
knowing he means everything to me. 
He cares, 
and you will see, 
he means everything to me. 
His name is Ivan, and hes my cat."

"event","Well im feeling a little down at the moment. My life has been ripped from me for the most part. I need a car. Damn my dad to hell and back! So I have a dad that doesnt care, People that think they rule my life, no car, no black & mild, no weed, fuck alcohol, a dumb ass teacher, and my mother thinks im a terrible daughter. I can't make anyone happy, everyone is mad at me, and I have learned that in this damn world your on your own. Friends are there to back you up when you need it most, and keep you company when you've fallen, and stick by your side no matter what. What are you suppost to do when you fall and your friends scatter? What do you do when your friends arent by your side anymore? What do you do when you realize that your alone in this world? I was a good friend, I was there for my friends when their boy/girl friends broke up with them, I was there when they got kicked out of their house, I was there when they were grounded from the world. Nobody was there for me when my boyfriend hurt me, where will i go when im kicked out? Whos gonna keep me company when im grounded too? Nobody....as usual.

I give credit to chris, hes the only one whose even called me to talk to me, and even came over, knowing there was nothing i could do or nowhere i could go. Maybe he thought he had to, or maybe he wanted to....ill never know.
 
And ashley, I must add ashley, because she loves me and I love her *manyhearts* and unlike some frinds, she cares :D"

"event","Not much actually. I skipped school, went mudding. Got cought and now i havent smoked anything. Im grounded and my mom is over re-acting. Im probably being transfered to another school. If mom wont let me make this day permissible, then im dropping out. If she transfers me to another school, then im not doing any work. Anyway, im thinking about moving up to my dad's. If I do, then this is good bye. I wont have a computer, nor friends, nor a job or a car. Life is pretty much pointless now. I hate my dad, but Im, hateing it here too."

-Pretty lyrics now :D-
+=-The Unforgiven II - Metallica-=+

Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you.

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this pair of lives
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there?, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there!

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there?, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

(Solo)

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes now I see it!

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there?, 'cause I'm the one who waits,
The one who waits for you

Oh what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you? 
(So I dub thee unforgiven)

Oh, what I've felt
Oh, what I've known!

I take this key (never free)
And I bury it (never me) in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too!"

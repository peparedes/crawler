today has been good man, like...the first good day in a while.

yesterday i had a good time with brenda,jesus,anna,charity,and alex and her manfriend. (lmao)

today, i talked to jeebus. he's cool, so i guess we are going to the movies friday...??? thats cool, but this time I have to be the man in the relationship and pick HIM up...lol...i dunno what we're gunna see probably Boogyman, or something :) 
we were talking and i guess hes still going out with his girlfriend...?
so i says to him,  i says ""will your GIRLLLLFRRRIIIEENNNDDD mind if we go to the movies? or will she HATE me??"" 
and he replys ""i dont know, and i dont care...dont worry about it, it would be my problem anyway"" 

so who knows! 

last night i was on the phone with Crystal for about a hour and a half...its so wierd because we were actually having a good conversation. i havnt seen her in days, but lately shes been texting me and calling me...so maybe theres hope? 
whatever, she better not fuck it up....grrrrr. i dont care, i'll probably be not as close with her anyways. i doubt it.

hmm what else is new...ahh...nothing really...Adam called me a million times yesterday because he got his license and he was essited. lolol. we might hang out this weekend or next week sometime, meh.
my mom said she was going to call the school and try to talk to my counsleour (sp) about me dropping this class...hopefully it'll work and i can go into either another art class, or Creative Writing. :) i think i would do good in that class, if i cant take it this semester then ima take it next year for an elective most likely, who knowsssss!

i also got a couple un-expected phone calls yesterday. i'm not gunna lie, i was happy when i saw your name on the caller id. 

ahh, what to do what 2 doooo. i hope i do something today, with people or something, i dont like spending half days at home, it makes me feel lame. =\

people are so confusing sometimes...

i was talking to a friend of mine, and like i guess they just needed to vent because they had alot on thier mind, so i was there, and she just vented and i realized that my problems arent NEARLY as bad as others...jeesh, i felt bad because this whole time i've been having my breakdowns for things, and shes going through SOOO MUCH bs, that it makes me problem not even look like a problem...i dunno if you get what i mean, but yeah...

so, turns out, Jesus is in my Lit class now, which is cool. : )

today was swell, aswell. 
Went swimming in gym, not as bad as i thought it would be...it was actually all right, =\ it just sucks because my hair is gay, and get frizzy like a mugggggg. 

anywho, yeah...today was alright i guess, its as well as its gunna be.

i'm mad @ chester because he took my Irish 4-leaf clover. Grrrrr.
i'll get it back though. 

last night my brother was over, it was cool. well, my brother and Christina. 
i'm really glad i have a Sister-In-Law that i can actually relate and talk to.
she was telling me all the gossip with her friends, and all her friendship problems, and stuff...and like...my whole outlook changed...because, i thought that when you got out of high school (shes about 21, or 22) maybe your friendships might be a little easier, what without all the gossip and stupid little kid games...when they really dont.
that sucks, i had hope. :(

a little changing the subject...

i hate the way you give me mixed signals. your Xanga says one thing, you act another...i try to talk to you, i try to be nice to you, and your an asshole towards me. i'm not saying i want to give us another chance, but i had hoped for a friendship at least. i hate the way you sit in class, and try to be that ""sucidal loner kid"" i just cant stand it. i hate the way we are now...i knew this was going to happen, and i cant say im suprised though, i should have never had a little hope for maybe...a friendship?? I tried i tried. i'm done with your depressing ways or should i say your ""Wanna be"" depressing ways. i'm tired of it. if you hate your life so much why dont you do something about it? and as i say that, im not hinting at suicide, i'm hinting at trying to find something that makes you happy. Replacing pain with pain is a mistake. a bad way to go. i hate the way you try to act like you arent what you are. (if that makes any sense). i really dont know what your becoming or what your trying to become...but i cant say i like it. 

Me: ::walking in class:: Hey.
You: ::a little crooked smile::
Me: You look, so...quiet, and unhappy.
You: Well thats me.

shut the fuck up. just shut the FUCK up. i know your really not like that. i know alot more then alot of people do...and I FOR ONE, know that you love life. that there are THINGS that do make you happy...so just go make a list, and write down all the things that make you happy, and make you smile...and focus on the list, because i'm not buying this act.
i can see through you.

::phew:: now thats OUT, lol..i think im done. 
i'm gunna go, talk to you people later."

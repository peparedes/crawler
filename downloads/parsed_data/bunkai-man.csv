"event","I have gotten tired of our cat Simon waking me up at 6:00 am (or earlier) demanding to be fed, so I have been looking into an automatic cat feeder.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ran across this review of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/CSF-3-Super-Feeder-Stand-Timer/dp/B000NOLD18/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1240105820&amp;sr=1-1"">CSF-3 Cat Super Feeder</a> on Amazon and it started to give me some ideas:<br /><br /><em>&quot;The Super Feeder was made for nerds like me. I have mine attached to a network power controller next to my server cabinet. I wrote several UNIX shell and expect scripts to control the feeding behavior. The cats are fed at every even hour of the day (12 times a day). This prevents the cats from getting too excited when food is dispensed and prevents overeating and eating too quickly. I also authored a password protected website that allows me to feed the cats from anywhere in the universe with the click of a button, as well as capturing a photographic image of the cats eating so I know that they are safe and that the feeder is working correctly. Every time the cats are fed I receive a page to my telephone showing me the output of the scripts to verify that everything is working correctly. &quot;</em><br /><br />What's even more amusing is that I have a spare network power controller lying around that could be used in a similar way.&nbsp; <br /><br />"

"event","Last Wednesday we had one of the most karate strenuous classes I have had in quite some time.&nbsp; The class generally focused on moving quickly against serious incoming attacks.&nbsp; While difficult, this was still within what I would consider my comfort zone. It is something we have done in class many times before, the attacks were ones I had seen before and had been prepared for with our training.<br /><br />But the final exercise we did in class was much more chaotic and challenging.&nbsp; We had two lines setup facing one another with eyes closed.&nbsp; At various points the Sensei would quietly tell one of the group to open their eyes and attack someone else in the one of the lines.&nbsp; As the defender the first thing we would feel might be hands around our neck, a slap in the face, or a punch in the gut.&nbsp; At which point we would open our eyes and explode with the appropriate self-defense.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have done similar exercises before and the aspect of it that is always the killer is the anticipation.&nbsp; Waiting for that hand, that kick, that grab or whatever makes you tighten up, it makes you tense, and it wears you out.&nbsp; Similar situations I have trained in were more rigidly structured.&nbsp; The Sensei would setup the two lines as pairs of partners.&nbsp; He/she would announce one of the two lines as the attacker, one as the defender with eyes closed.&nbsp; The beginning of the attack would be announced to the whole class, allowing a defender to bound their anticipation and relax.&nbsp; This time it was not so straightforward.<br /><br />As my eyes were closed I could hear the frantic movement of bodies attacking and defending nearby, and yet I had to keep them closed.&nbsp; It was not clear when or if an attack would occur despite all the commotion surrounding me.&nbsp; When it did happen it was a quick few seconds with a flurry of techniques without any time to truly assess, only react.&nbsp; Afterwards it was back to eyes shut, waiting, feeling the adrenaline continue to pump making it incredibly hard to relax and not waste energy with tense muscles.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the principles taught in martial arts is that of <strong>zanshin</strong>, relaxed alertness.&nbsp; Learning to be aware of what is going on without being unnecessarily paranoid about what might be a threat.&nbsp; I have never quite understood that concept as well as did that night. <br />"

"event","Apparently it was not a just a <a href=""http://katesg7.livejournal.com/90354.html"">problem with the washer</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning the shower caused the water waste pipe for the washer to overflow again.&nbsp; It had done that twice last night when we ran the washer.&nbsp; Looks like we have a main drain clog of some sort that is causing overflow whenever we use large amounts of water at once.&nbsp; I suppose the one nice thing is that it isn't a complete clog, just a slow flow.&nbsp; This means we can at least use the toilet.<br /><br />So I call up the plumber to send a guy down here to use some sort of super plumber's snake to clear the drain.&nbsp; He shows up quickly, within an hour, and starts inspecting the plumbing in our house.&nbsp; After he looks at everything he comes to this startling conclusion: we are not actually on sewer, as we thought, but we are on a septic system.&nbsp; This of course makes no sense to me.<br /><br />First, we were told the house is on sewer.&nbsp; Second, we have a pool in the backyard where a septic system would be.&nbsp; From what I understand, it ain't legal or safe to install a pool next to a septic system.&nbsp; (Granted our pool was <a href=""http://bunkai-man.livejournal.com/43051.html"">green at one point last year</a> but that was not due to a septic system.)&nbsp; Thirdly we had the old jacuzzi in our backyard removed and that involved digging right next to where the septic tank would be.&nbsp; Presumably we would have found evidence of it when we did that (like a disgusting black geyser when we struck it).&nbsp; Lastly we have been getting billed for sewer service in our town.<br /><br />However the evidence was against a sewer hookup.&nbsp; First the street (where the main sewer line would be) is uphill from our house.&nbsp; Second the main sewer pipe in our basement slopes away from the street.&nbsp; Thirdly, we had no evidence in our plot plans of a sewer connection.&nbsp; We had only the original plot (circa 1965) that had a septic system clearly listed on it.&nbsp; Fourthly, the sewer bill means nothing.&nbsp; The town measures only the water coming in and assumes the same amount comes out via the sewer.&nbsp; Lastly, the overflow problem we were seeing could have been caused by recent weather conditions.&nbsp; Lots of snow (20&quot;) and then a couple of warm days caused massive melting.&nbsp; The melting would saturate our leech field (if we had one), and when combined with a full septic tank (assumed) it would cause an overflow when we used the shower or washer.&nbsp; <br /><br />The moral of the story is that our plumber doesn't do septic.&nbsp; Without knowing one way or the other, he didn't want to do the work.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&nbsp;furiously started calling around to the Town of Billerica Sewer Department and the Assessor's office, and anyone else that I thought could help me sort this silly thing out and determine which was it:&nbsp;sewer or septic?&nbsp; Eventually I was directed to the Waste Treatment Facility Offices, which are located at... you guessed it... the Waste Treatment Facility.&nbsp; After driving down a long road with signs warning that I was trespassing unless I was conducting official <em>waste treatment business</em>, I finally arrived at a small office building nestled alongside a large <strong>Aeration Basin</strong>.&nbsp; An aeration basin is an open, swimming-pool-like structure where the waste mixes with the air to culminate in the most disgusting smell you will ever smell.<br /><br />However having previously called ahead the nice woman at the administrative offices already had a photocopy of the proof I needed:&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;sewer inspection certificate from 2003. &nbsp;Success!<br /><br />So I called the plumber back and said come on back!&nbsp; And hopefully soon I will get to take a shower.<br /><br />"

"event","So our mailbox was whacked yet again by some careless driver and knocked completely off the post.&nbsp; This is the second time this winter season, but does not seem to have anything to do with the plows.&nbsp; In fact the first time there was no snow on the ground at all.<br /><br />Having done this twice before, I&nbsp;set about the simple task of affixing the mailbox and its wood supports back to the post&nbsp;(which is completely fine).&nbsp; To do this I&nbsp;needed a 6&quot; long bolt that I could drive through the post and into the 4x4 support beam.&nbsp; I&nbsp;went to the hardware store and grabbed two (I have a feeling I&nbsp;might be doing this again) and came home.<br /><br />As I&nbsp;actually set about to do the work I noticed that the old, diagonal cross beam was breaking apart and would probably not reasonable hold new screws, and the previous screws were damaged such that they could not be removed.&nbsp; So that meant buying new wood support and cross beams.&nbsp; Back to the hardware store.<br /><br />My local hardware store did not actually stock lumber so I&nbsp;went to a nearby <strong>Home Despot</strong> and bought treated lumber there, with plenty of extra (in case I&nbsp;might need to do this again).&nbsp; I carted it home and broke out my mitre saw to begin trimming the lumber to the sizes I need. &nbsp;<br /><br />Now this mitre saw was one of the so called <strong>bonuses</strong> that the last owners left behind.&nbsp; They did this not out of kindness but because they were idiots and didn't plan well enough to move all of their stuff out of the house on the day that we closed.&nbsp; However the saw did prove quite handy a couple times in the past and I was hoping to continue that.&nbsp; No such luck.&nbsp; <br /><br />The saw was not well maintained; it is rusted in many places and the blade is as dull as a Woody Allen movie.&nbsp; I managed to cut the 2x4 but only after the saw put up quite a fight with lots of smoke and a horrible burning smell.&nbsp; No way was I&nbsp;going to be able to cut the 4x4.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I thought maybe I can just replace the blade.&nbsp; Don't be silly Rob, of course you can't.&nbsp; The nut holding the blade on is wedged tight (probably rusted) and slightly stripped.&nbsp; No amount of herculean force will budge it.&nbsp; Back to the store again.<br /><br />At Sears I decided I&nbsp;wanted the new mitre saw that everyone in the online reviews seems to like. &nbsp; At that point the sales clerk, his name was Murphy I think, informs me that they don't actually have that one in stock.&nbsp; But he can order it.&nbsp; *sigh*<br /><br />Destiny would simply not allow me to fix my mailbox.&nbsp; Maybe it is a sign that I&nbsp;should just boycott receiving snail mail altogether.&nbsp; All we get is bills and circulars anyways.&nbsp; <br /><br />"

This involves removing shoes, belts, emptying my&nbsp; <br />pockets, opening up the suitcase and pulling out my toiletries bag so they precisely measure my liquids to make sure I don't exceed the&nbsp; <br />maximum 2.5 ounces, and then reversing the whole process to put myself and my stuff back together.<br /><br />I consider myself pretty organized and the act of going thru security seems like a determined attempt to dishelve, disorient, and mess me&nbsp; <br />up. Even having gone through it a number of times before it still throws me off.&nbsp;  It feels like a <span id=""lw_1222053391_2"" class=""yshortcuts"">whiffle ball game</span> where you have to&nbsp; <br />put your head on the batt and spin around a number of times before hitting the ball and running to first base. Just before you get up to&nbsp; <br />batt you have a very clear path of where you need to go and what you need to do, therefore they have to make you do things to throw you off&nbsp; <br />and make it difficult.<br /><br />Taking off one's shoes seems like such a waste of time and needlessly slows things down to protect against one very specific avenue for&nbsp; <br />malicious activity. I really want some idiot to smuggle something in his underwear and get caught. That way TSA will respond by forcing&nbsp; <br />everyone to remove their unmentionables, which will last a week before passengers revolt and start a riot at LAX.<br /><br />So after my latest run thru the Atlanta security checkpoint's barrage of trials I  then took the escalator down to the terminal train&nbsp; <br />and hopped onboard.&nbsp; It was at this point that I realized I had somehow forgotten my rollerbag at the security checkpoint.<br /><br />I immediately got off the tram and proceeded to try and backtrack to the checkpoint, but found that this was not possible.&nbsp; The escalators going down had no alternative escalator going up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried a few other promising options but they all ended up in dead-ends, or worse, going through some door that I probably shouldn't go through.&nbsp; So I had no other alternative but to exit the secured area and re-enter.<br /><br />Now one of the strange things that they do before you get to the X-ray machines is that they have a TSA employee verify your ID and check your boarding pass.&nbsp; Once they have done this they take a magic marker a put a little squiggle on your boarding pass.&nbsp; What this squiggle means and why they do this is beyond me.&nbsp; Because when I got back up to the nice man at the checkpoint he almost didn't notice the pre-squiggled boarding pass.&nbsp; And when he did, I simply told him I had left a bag at the security checkpoint and needed to get back through again.&nbsp; He waved me on through, probably because this is something that happens from time to time.<br /><br />I of course went through the entire security dance again, and then proceeded to the lost luggage counter.&nbsp; I got my bag back and was on my way.&nbsp; What has this taught me.... well nothing really, other than don't ever leave your bag at the checkpoint in Atlanta.<br />"

<br /><br />I will admit I met Marc doing something really geeky at college, and that was playing Dungeons and Dragons.&nbsp; Yes we are pretty much the lowest on the totem pole of geeks as we routinely get together with a bunch of guys to play games that most people stop playing in High school.&nbsp; <br /><br />But Marc is definitely not your typical stereotype because he spends the majority of his time doing the thing that he probably loves the most, and that is social dancing.&nbsp; He started in high school and continued to dance throughout college helping teach newcomers who had two left feet and no sense of rhythm, how to put one foot in front of the other and move in the very basic patterns of Fox Trot, Waltz, Tango, Merengue, East Coast Swing, Cha Cha and Rhumba.&nbsp; He has quite the repertoire of dances under his belt and helped hundreds of people at Syracuse University learn how to dance.&nbsp; I should know&hellip; because I was one of those people with two left feet.&nbsp; In my senior year he twisted my arm and encouraged me to sign up for Walt Medici&rsquo;s Introduction to Social Dance &hellip; and for that I am forever grateful, for it is where I met my wife Katie.&nbsp; <br /><br />At social dance class I was able to see Marc in his native environment, where he was definitely the most comfortable and seemed to have the most fun.&nbsp; Marc went out dancing more often than I think he went to class.&nbsp; Marc was a Music Major in college studying the Bassoon&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t think his dancing really affected his studies.&nbsp; For those that have heard the bassoon on its own, you&rsquo;ll probably agree with me that you really can&rsquo;t tell the difference between a good note and a bad note.&nbsp; <br /><br />Marc&rsquo;s dancing continued long after he graduated college, long after others that had learned to dance with him in Walt&rsquo;s class had stopped dancing.&nbsp; It is his passion, and from the dance you just saw them do&hellip; he and Stephanie are really good at it.&nbsp; To this day he continues to teach dance lessons with Stephanie to people of all ages and all expertise at the Dancing Feats dance studio.&nbsp; <br /><br />When Marc first started dating Stephanie he didn&rsquo;t really talk about her much, but I think what they did together showed a lot more about her and the two of them as a couple.&nbsp; Stephanie is trained as a professional accountant, but don&rsquo;t let that fool you.&nbsp; She is as just as silly and quirky as Marc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Chick-fil-a is a fast food restaurant that does a promotion every year where they give away a free meal to anyone willing to dress up like a cow.&nbsp; Marc and Stephanie both dressed up like cows, completely from head to toe, and went down to the Chick-fil-a at the Burlington Mall.&nbsp; Not because they were looking for a free meal, since they probably spent more on the costumes than what the meal cost, but because it was fun.&nbsp; You can see a very cute picture of the happy couple in their cow costumes on their website, StephAndMarc.com.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stephanie is also a dancer and the two of them travel quite a ways to spend entire weekends dancing, teaching, competing, and attending workshops to continue to learn and pursue their love of social dancing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very happy that the two of them&hellip; not just Marc&hellip; have found someone that really appreciates and thrives on an activity they both love.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have spent a lot of time with Marc and Stephanie watching them as a couple, and one of the things that I noticed about them is that they continue to be individual people that can be themselves&hellip; but be together.&nbsp; Stephanie is not a person that sees Marc as someone she needs to change or improve upon.&nbsp; Marc is a man that she loves for all his strange and unique personality and she doesn&rsquo;t stifle that.&nbsp; Both Marc and Stephanie are people that I have spent time with separately as well as when they were together and I can honestly say they are not radically different people in those situations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Marc and Stephanie are two people that both enjoy and appreciate one another for who they are and that is something very special.&nbsp; The two of them are fun, vibrant, and wonderful individuals who have found a beautiful connection and want to celebrate that today with all of their family and friends.&nbsp; And so I would like to propose a toast to Marc and Stephanie Levetin, may you continue to share and grow for many years to come as two people with one life together.&nbsp; (pause) To Marc and Stephanie&hellip;<br />

"event","When we replaced the filter for our pool, we also added a <b>Chlorinator</b> to the plumbing system.&nbsp; Chlorine is a very nasty chemical and in concentrated amounts can do damage to the pipes if it just sits there dissolving in water.&nbsp; The chlorinator is a device that can contain the chlorine when the pool is not running so that it does not damage the rest of the plumbing, and it has the added bonus that the amount of chlorine released into the system can be controlled with a dial.&nbsp; <br /><br />Physically it is a small cylindrical canister about 1.5 feet tall and a 6 inches across.&nbsp; It honestly looks like it could be a chemical weapon container that the bad guys use on 24.&nbsp; And what's more it actually does contain potentially lethal chlorine gas.&nbsp; <br /><br />To use this thing, we fill it up with Jumbo Slo-Poke Chlorine tabs (they look like round bars of soap) which slowly dissolve.&nbsp; The difficulty is that the cannister has no indicator on the outside as to how many tabs are left in the container.&nbsp; The only way to determine this is to unscrew the cap and look inside.&nbsp; If I do this, it releases the concentrated chlorine gas into the air in our small shed.&nbsp; Now I really only need to briefly look down inside to determine whether or not I need to add more tabs, so I end up trying to hold my breath and putting my face right over the cannister to see the number of tabs I have left.&nbsp; This is probably not a good idea.<br /><br />I started looking online to see if I could get a mask that protects against this sort of thing.&nbsp; As with many searches online, this did not turn up the results I was looking for.&nbsp; Since chlorine gas was used as a chemical weapon in World War I (and probably many other wars) the gas masks that I found where all scary looking military garb that cover the entire head.&nbsp; Acquiring one of these would only make it even more likely that the Department of Homeland Security will come knocking on my door to inquire about my plans with the gas.<br /><br />As I don't need complete protection for an extended period of time, I would prefer something lighter.&nbsp; But most simple masks protect against dust particles as opposed to airborne weapons.&nbsp; I'll have to keep digging."

It is a strange but peaceful experience.  I find it much like a retreat, where the basic amenities of food and board are taken care of, and all you have to think about or focus on is the task laid out before you.  In this case, studying Kokondo Karate.  There isn't a lot of down time to do much else, so the call of the outside world is muffled here (though I have my laptop and I can see my work emails pile up).  

The college dorm rooms that we stay in remind me of my college life.  During which I did not do much else than study for my chosen profession.  Sure there were lots of other things going on, but I found that my studies were a bit all consuming and left little time for anything else.  

I feel as though my life is much more complex, noisy, and full of distractions these days, and so it is extremely rare to have the chance to spend an extended period of time doing only this one thing.

I hateto say that perhaps my excitement of opening night (no pun intended) has been waning in recent years.  I used to love to see fan favorite movies (LoTR, Star Wars) on opening day (or at least opening weekend) but now I am finding it less and less practical or enjoyable.

Movie theaters just aren't the wondrous places that they were when you were 13 and the thought of going to a place dedicated to watching movies and eating sugary and salty snacks was the epitome of life.  

We got to the theater last night in enough time to find only a handful of seats still together, and of course they were in one of the front rows that everyone tries hard to avoid.  This is one of those rows where the floor slopes up instead of down and the seats feel like they are tilting back too far to be comfortable but not enough to be able to see the screen well.  I was misled to believe that the Woburn Showcase Cinemas theaters had stadium seating.  At least with Stadium seating the chances of being stuck in one of those crappy contortionist seats is greatly reduced.  Never again will I patronize you Woburn Cimena.

Now while I enjoyed the movie (as much as my back spasms allowed) I couldn't help but think that it would have been more convenient and enjoyable to simply pirate the movie and watch it in my own living room.  Now I don't have nearly as nice a visual and audio setup as even a poor movie theater, but I don't know that I get my money's worth even if I like the movie.

Not that I would do this, but do people think I would be justified in buying a ticket online but never show up to the theater and then just download the movie from <a href=""http://thepiratebay.org"">Pirate Bay</a>?"

I got a letter today from Comcast telling me that they were going to move several analog cable channels over to the digital domain.  Which means unless I have a digital receiver box I can't watch those channels anymore.  Very clever way to force holdouts like me to finally upgrade to digital cable.  

Now luckily the affected channels are none that I watch (e.g. the Hallmark channel, who seriously watches that?).  However I wonder if it is only a matter of time before they shrink down the analog cable channel list until it is has nothing but the Spanish channel, thereby forcing everyone to buy their expensive digital cable service.  

I have this great bias against upgrading to digital cable due to the fact that their service <b>never</b> drops in price even after technology becomes cheaper and the initial infrastructure cost has been paid for."

This was the case when I ran into a bug in our software running on our wireless chip.  There is no GUI, no command-line, no visual output, and no debug ports. (See when you only have 128 kilobytes of flash space it doesn't leave much room for debugging software.)  This little dilemma meant I couldn't use any existing tools or tricks in my repertoire, I would have to get creative.        

The only thing I could do was send messages over-the-air.  So I re-wrote our <b>printf()</b> routine to broadcast messages instead of writing data to the serial port. Then I had a wireless sniffer capture the messages and display them to me.  Falling back on the old technique of leaving breadcrumbs, I could add a whole bunch of print statements to trace the flow of control in the software and figure out what the heck was going on.

Well the tree guy quoted us a couple of different prices for removing the debris, removing the entire tree, and removing another dead tree in the backyard that is a hazard.  However, he said that if the trees are not on our property and on our neighbor's property we would need written authorization to do the work.  Shouldn't be a big deal, should it?

So we left a note on our neighbor's door saying that we were going to remove the debris and the first dead tree, and asked if they wanted to split the removal of the second dead tree (it actually poses more of a risk to them than us).  The nice lady next door called us back and told us we could do whatever we want, but that <b>she wasn't authorized to make decisions about the house anymore.</b>  Apparently the town owns the house, failure to pay taxes I guess; I didn't pry.  A realtor is selling the house and they are moving out in the near future.

So this simple little job is turning into quite a pain in the butt.  It is unlikely we'll be able to cut through all the bureaucratic nonsense to find the right government guy that can sign off and give authorization to remove the trees in a reasonable period of time.  And there is no way the town will help pay for the removal.

As I continue to study Kokondo Karate these days I have noticed I have to pay attention to little things more and more.  Refinement is the name of the game.  My own progress is no longer measured in knowing this technique or that technique, or knowing kata XYZ. I have found my training to be about the polishing of my existing repertoire of self-defense.  

Part of my continued study is maintenance, making sure I keep doing what I know in the right way.  However I often find myself rediscovering something I learned a while back but wasn't able to process fully at the time.  This could be a particular technique, an application of self-defense from a kata, or simply the way in which I transition from one technique to the next.  It is all parts of Kokondo I know on some level, but now I see it in a different light.  

These are now the hidden gems of my study.  Sure I like to learn new things, but true mastery is about understanding what you do know inside and out.  

I have to say that this is very refreshing.  There are days when I can't stand my chosen profession.  Computers and technology evolve too rapidly and move entirely too fast for its own good.  It often feels as though it is a waste to spend too much time on any one facet as it may be obsolete or trivial in a few years.  Many of the concepts stay the same, but too often the tools or the components that make up a technology change, or just become unimportant.  I love figuring out how things work, and digging into the details.  These days I am feeling that too often in my work it isn't worth it to find the root cause or really understand how a piece of software works because it will end up changing, and then I will end up wasting my gray matter."

This is the dumbest thing I have ever heard when it comes to computer security.  This greatly reduces the security of a password and makes people choose easy to remember, easy to attack passwords.  

HSBC Direct, which I generally love, goes to the extent of making you create two separate passwords.  One of these passwords you are required to enter via a virtual onscreen keyboard.  This is done to protect against locally installed keylogger software, which is a great idea in my opinion.  

But then they don't allow special characters.  Why?!"

Now that I know that, I am very wary of coming into contact with this or any other clones of me.  I assume that they are made of anti-matter, dark plutonium, or some other opposite polarity sci-fi substance that would invariably cause a rip in the very fabric of the universe should I ever meet them face to face.  

At least I know of the existence of one of them, so I can avoid him.  Katie is very disturbed by this."

Just as they had got to the point in the movie where Leela and the crew were preparing an all out offensive against the Scammers and their fleet of gold plated Death Stars, I turned to Katie and exclaimed:  ""Where the hell is Zap Brannigan?!""

The movie immediately chimed in with President Nixon's head remarking, ""And here to present our daring plan to take back Earth is Zap Brannigan!""

"event","I am all for challenging games but Contra 4 is just ridiculous.  When it comes down to it, it is just not fun.

Originally I was extremely excited when they were going to release a new Contra game for the DS.  I loved the original, as well as Super C and Contra III.  Contra III added a difficulty level, which was a good way to balance out the fun versus challenge.  A friend and I managed to slog through the entire game and beat it on Hard.  

But Contra 4 is just painful and unforgiving.  I beat the game on easy (which wasn't) but it won't let you play the last <b>2 levels</b> except on Normal or Hard... exceedingly lame.  I started to play through on normal and repeatedly had difficulty even getting through to the third level, and I don't consider myself a Contra neophyte by any means.  

After many attempts I got to the end of the the sixth level, out of lives but at the last boss.  I managed to kill the armless robotic-ape but a stray missile he had fired before his death hit my character a second afterwards and I died.  Another issue I have with the game.  After defeating certain enemies or locations the entire screen explodes and the remaining bad guys die.  But their bullets do not (this was <b>not the case in previous Contras</b>).  This is exceedingly problematic because sometimes your character is frozen in his cool-guy-action-pose watching the evil alien monster flail and die, only to be killed after the fact by a slow-moving glowing bullet.  It kinda takes away from the victory.

But this time I encountered something strange.  Instead of being dumped to the continue screen to highlight my failure and having to redo the <b>entire</b> level (another flaw), my extra lives count rolled over to <b>99</b>.  I thought, this is great!  I can now easily beat the game on the Normal difficulty.

No such luck.  I managed to get to the last level with 50 lives left and that still wasn't nearly enough to defeat the last evil alien.  That's just crappy.  Note to developers: Games are supposed to be fun.  Difficulty levels should not increase exponentially.

And no, there is no Konami code.  I tried.  Another flaw in the game."

"event","We are slowly getting a few house victories.  I finally gave up on our inherited snow blower and decided to buy a new one.  The other one didn't start, and I decided I didn't like going down the path of repairing it.  This involved the problem of getting it to and from a repair shop (it won't fit in our car), and paying an unknown sum of money have it repaired since we didn't know what shape it was in.  I also didn't think it would cut it in terms of power and snow throwing capabilities given our large U-shaped driveway (at least that's what I told people, but I think I just liked the idea of a brand new toy.)

My new snow blower is a Craftsman 28"" 9.0 hp.  This sucker does the trick.  <b>Take that snow!</b>  I managed to reclaim all of the driveway we had lost due to the several previous snow storms that we failed to completely shovel out from.  I found myself almost disappointed when it snowed less than the 8"" that was predicted last night.  Surely that sensation will fade in a couple storms.

I even managed to break-in the snow blower, literally.  I snapped two of the sheering bolts on a large stick and turned half of the blower into a glorified plow.  Luckily my father had pointed out what these were and that it came with a couple replacements.  So fixing it was trivial."

Every year or two the marketing guys issue a press release saying, ""it's coming out next year!"".  <a href=""http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/5164"">And so the trend continues.</a>  The previous game, Duke Nukem 3D, hails back to the Doom II days.  I can't even imagine what it would like with today's graphics engines.

I don't understand why 3D Realms thinks this is still a good idea.  Doom III was released 10 years after Doom II (though they weren't actually developing it all that time), and it did <i>okay</i>.  ID Software didn't get nearly the huge sales it was hoping for.  

Gamers have moved on to bigger and better things.  The days of shooting fireball tossing monsters have gone away in favor of sniper rifle headshots and duck and cover strategy."

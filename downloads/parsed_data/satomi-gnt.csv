"event","Yay! 11:30 am and I was on the 2nd to last page of my 7-page lab report due at 1:30 today, when what do you know?, Fairfax lost power- for about an hour.  I responded immediately with  ""oh, shit..."", then a bit of tears.  Then came hopefulness that classes would be cancelled, then came mass hunger followed by disappointment since the food court was of course closed.  Then came Wajiha and Sasha ""Rwar, let's get pho!"" Me- ""Rwar, nommies!""  Then came more disappointment as we drove up to the place and all the lights were out.  At this point brilliance was had, as we decided to try Lotte.  YAY! They were open and we could eat. Then Wajiha called her prof to see if lab was cancelled- ""Rwar, u haf 2 come, AHAhAHahAHa!!!!!111 All power is on!!!!!!!111 ROFLROFLROFL.""  And I cried..., on the inside- on the outside I looked like God gave me a big forehead and wideset eyes, but that's ok because my smiles come in a bright orange bottle with a child-safe cap.  When I got to lab the prof ran by ""No classie, nooo classie!!!! But maybe classie!""  Then we had lecture in a musical chairs kinda-way, only with rooms instead of chairs.  Then a quizzie- I vomited on my paper and rolled only my face in it, since we weren't allowed to get up during the quizznit.  Then I say ""Rwar, prof you stole my book!!!"" Prof- ""No bookie, noooo bookie!!! Maybe bookie, go ask Dr lab man ROFLROFLROFL!!!!111""  Me to Dr lab man- ""Wan book now!"" Dr lab man- ""No"" then ""Maybe bookie, you follow me ALL over place, AHaHaha!!!111"" No book found, so I went to my prof again- ""I e-mail you till I get book back."" Prof- ""Here, have my bookie!!"" Me- ""Rwar, why not sooner?""

And so now I get to retype my whole lab, because the prof gave everybody a 1 week extension, but also said that now we have <u>3</u> lab reports due next week.  So yay!"

"event","Yay! As you know, went to the BNL concert with Sasha.  I don't really like their music, but they always put on a really good show.  Of course, I had to go to school and the roundup before the concert, so I was really tired by the time we got home from it.  But Sasha didn't want to sleep yet, nooo, first we have to laugh at pr0n.  That was my first pr0n, and it seriously scarred me, and made me want to vomit at parts.
And the whole time from Sun to Tues I was house sitting for Dr M.  We watched pr0n on Dr M's TV!!!!!!!111 LOLOLOLOL!!!!!111
Anyway, about the roundup- yes, this was at Mike's family's farm- the roundup was to vaccinate all the cattle.  I mostly drew up vax's for the moomoos, which meant drawing up 12 cc's of molasses consistency Ivomec 300 times, along with the 2 other vax they get.  Plus I had to keep the records straight on which cows got what, what vial # their blood was, and whether or not they were pregnant (I was in class while the bulls were being done).  I stabbed myself with a used needle by accident and couldn't wash my hands for 2 hours, since we were deep in the fields.  And of course, being so deep in the fields we were ankle deep in meadow muffins most of the time.  So now my finger is swollen and my thumb is bruised and my shoes are stinky.  But I had a hellagood time.
Needless to say I should have showered before the concert, but traffic was really bad and I got home late, so I didn't have time or we'd miss the concert.  Anyway, much fun was had with Sasha at the concert.  Tuesday I went to class and left early for the roundup again.  We finished the whole farm by 4:30.  And then I slept.  I didn't go to classes yesterday- because I slept!  I came home from work yesterday- and SLEPT!  I wish I was sleeping now.
BTW Megann and Sasha, thank you for visiting my site ^_^.  And also, I've always wanted to do a Rainbow Bright cosplay too."

"event","yay! since sasha thinks I'm not random enough in my posts and that I talk about school too much, here goes idle blather:

I'm wearing my sister's lime green sweater today- I didn't know if it was clean or dirty when I put it on, but I think it doesn't smell, so it was prolly clean.

I was late for class today because I went 1/2way down my street to the highway, when I realized I'd forgotten my cell phone and Sasha wouldn't be able to contact me for lunch.  So I turned around and got it, but it wasn't very useful, was it?  Please, Sasha- don't think I'm being bitter to you- just trying to be random for you.

I think I'm the only one who has visited my website since I put it up.  I feel like I'm ballot-box stuffing every time I visit it and the counter goes up.  Then again, the counter doesn't really work anyway.

And just to complete my entry- I got a low ""B"" on the organic exam that made me cry (only because everyone else failed too), I got a mid ""B"" on my plant bio exam, and a high ""C"" on my geog exam that I didn't even know we were having (since I had skipped so many classes).  I still have to apply for my gov. aid for this year.  And I still have to talk to my advisor before I can register, which is bad, since reg. started yesterday."

Lately I've been feeling so stressed and overworked- it's like all my life is spent just passing the time because I don't even know what's going on anymore.  And speaking of overworked, tomorrow marks my 6th Saturday in a row having to work.  Thankfully I have next weekend off, but I'll prolly be at Dr M's house dog-sitting, so its not really time off.  I just want one day of vegetative bliss.  I won't even have a restful Thanksgiving break- I'll be having my wisdom teeth pulled.  Aaaaagh, I just want to cry."

"event","Started Fri. night-
 Pre-dinner for the family and friends of Whitestone Farm (Mike's family's farm) which I arrived at  1 1/2 hours late b/c of work (last appt. was a broken toe which needed x-rays and a splint).  The food Mike set aside for me was pretty good, the dancing was -interesting-, and it was pretty fun overall... except for George, Mike's 53 yr old millionaire cousin.  My family thinks he has some mental/developmental problems, b/c he gets on a subject and just harps on it, no matter how uncomfortable or inappropriate it is- like trying to play Mike over foozball to win ME as the prize for the night (all this infront of my PARENTS no less)! And George kept telling me he was going to bring Mike with him to the next -wet bikini- contest he was judging, and that I should compete.  Elgh! you sick, pampered, rich-bitch, chouvanistic, war-mongrel. Why the HELL would you say that? Anyway, I was a little more rude than the situation warrented, but that was b/c of the -one- drink I had that some how f*ed me up.  Since I couldn't drive home, I spent the night at Mike's parent's house.

Sat. morning-
 I woke up around 7:30, thought it was 8:30, and drove back to my house (10 min drive) to shower and change for the sale.  Got back to the farm, and basically everything was already hectic.  I parked cars for about 1 1/2 hours till the vet got there and the sale actually started.  Then I did some data entry for a bit, and then doc and I got down to business writing out health certificates for the animals as they were sold.  The selling was western auction style and 198 animals were sold individually within 3.6 hours.  Doc an' I were there till 7 (3 extra hours) trying to sort out and double check everything, mostly b/c his dumbass, uncooth, unhelpful ""assistants"" were nowhere to be found.  Ergh.
Thankfully, everyone decided to go out for din-din to celebrate such a good sale, which was great since I hadn't eaten since breakfast.  We invited my mom (but not my dad, since he's an ass and has alienated himself from Mike's family, what with that whole kicking Mike out of the house thing).  We went to this little place in Leesburg called the Eiffel Tower that's pretty damn nice for what looks like a hole-in-the-wall kinda joint. George -had- to mention playing for me again, infront of my mother- again.  Much champaigne and wine and liquer-pickled strawberries were consumed.  One nice thing to say about George- he decided to cover the tab at the restaurant.  I slept over at the farm again ^_^

Sun. morning-
 AAAGGHH!  I have so much HW to do!"

well, my sis is in the bahama's with her boyfriend, my mom is in miami, and i'm stuck at home with my nana and father (whom i recently told ""...if it makes you mad then, fuck yeah i'll do it!"").  slightly tense at home.  been doing crazy amounts of house work lately, very little studying.  i NEED to study since i have 2 exams in the next 2 days.  i think i'll do well regardless.  organic is beginning to scare the shit outta me- i still haven't bought the book or model set or practice exams or work book ;_;  so overwhelming!

um, megann/ sasha, i remember your cos' have wings, but mine doesn't- at least in the char. sketch.  even if she does, i don't really wanna make them.  and for the instruments- you could prabaly find used ones at goodwill or ebay or someplace so you wouldn't have to make them.

does anyone know the lyrics for ""greensleeves"", the old hymn/ work song?  or where to find them?  thnx!

and today i get to face dawn about an altercation with one of the kennel kids a few days ago.  i don't know if she's even taking it seriously, but if she is... she can have quite the temper.  i don't think she would have acted any differently though if she were in the same situation.

well, here we go, for the 1st time in 2 or 3 months:

1, it is my 21st b-day this sunday, but since a night of drinking is not cool on a sunday, i'll go out on sat. with as many of my friends as can come, and some people i don't know.  if you are free this weekend, like to drink, and know who i am, then please gimme a call or email.  the more the merrier!

2, classes are reasonably hard this semester.  actaully, for 2 of my classes i still haven't bought the books yet.  this could have been a huge problem this week since i had an exam in every class this week on every day.  thankfully, i got a ""B"" on every one of them.  pretty good for not even being able to read what we're being tested on.

3, for those who know her, my mom had back surgery last thursday.  it went well, and she's able to walk in short doses now.  she doesn't have to be back to work for another 2 weeks, which is good because she's still in a lot of pain.  but she was stupid and didn't take the antibiotics they Rx'ed her, which were at a really heavy dose, so you know the docs meant business.  it ends up that she got a huge infection inside her cheek causing it to puff up real big.  and that's because her immune system is so impaired after this taxing surgery. stupeed.

4, i think i wish there was a 4, or a spoon

5, i haven't raped borders in a very long time- i feel the craving so strongly.  datda, we have to go soon!

6, this week was hell, and i'll be glad when it's over.  3 exams, 2 labs, 1 5-page paper, work this sat. morn.  i can't wait for sat night when i finally get to let loose and party a little.

ok, i'll try to be more regular with my posting again, but it won't be more than once a week.  i don't have the time anymore ^_^"

This week was the foxtrot.  Its a rather boring unnatural dance.  Mike has never danced a day in his life, so he was doing pretty awefully.  And he got embarresed about it too, so that didn't make things any easier for him.  He told me he felt like never going back, but that he REALLY wanted to do this for me so we could dance together.  So sweet ^___^

In other news, the webby is progressing nicely.  I wonder if Megann is checking out yahoo domains for the new page?  My sis downloaded ""big butts"" onto her cell for a ringer.  It's pretty funny, cuz everyone in the room stops to find where its coming from and if it's really what they think they're hearing.  Ah, 80's rap, we shalt never forget thee.  I really wanna download some j-rock rings.  Speaking of j-rock, I have recently realized my lovce of Luna Sea, though I've had the CD for almost 2 years now. 

AND, one last thing, my mom found Reneissance Man on DVD and bought it for me.  I don't know why, but I really love that movie.

off to more work on the webby, then work."

"event","well, let's see- I believe it's been a month since my last update.  and almost as long since the last time I read my friends' lj's.

right now I'm taking a dreadful advanced english composition class.  I hate english in the 1st place, but to have to take a full-credits advanced class in 5 weeks- it's torture.  and not helping my GPA.  i'll probably only take 3 classes next semester, but it'll still count as full-time since they're all 4 credits (and have a 3 hr lab each week for all of them).

um, don't know if anyone remembers, but my g-pa has been in really bad shape for the past 2 months- stokes, liver and kidney failure...  well, the docs in the ICU (where he's been for the past 5 weeks) said he would pass away this last thursday.  but he's still alive, quite to the amazement of everyone.  some say you get better right before you get worse.  he's looking like he'll be around for a while though ^_^ (apparently his lungs have taken over the filtering work that his kidney's had done- suctioning a <u>gallon</u> from his lungs everyday)

um, still going out with mike, and happy.  he's playing alot of gigs lately, like tonight- grog n tankard.  i hope they make it big.

ugh!  last night/ this morning at 4am i was awoken by my cell phone ringing- it was kevin, who hasn't called me and barely IMed me in the past 3 months since school's out, saying he was going to leave me a message.  why???  why at 4am???  why not call when i'll answer?  ugh!  but i'm not too mad- it's nice to talk to him once in a while.  i really miss him actually.

and... (trumpets, drum roll) i got a new cell phone today from my mom, since the last one just kinda went kaplooey.  cute little samsung phlip-fone ^___^

last weekend sasha, michelle, and i went to KD- much fun had, many old rides i'd never been on were riden.  much fooling of ashley was done.  also some de-hydration.  yay!  yay for wet street-clothes too!  and especially visors in the bright sun.

had 5 baby bunnies- turned them over to wildlife rescue, 4 died.  haven't called about the last one cuz he was my fav and if i don't call and find out he's gone, then it's like he's still alive.  want a bunnie now to keep.  too many animals already, though.

um, all for now- want something to talk aout next time."

i saw the snapple commercial with the guinea pigs-as-bulls for the first time yesterday.  oh, so funny!  and cute, in an odd way o.0

hmm, again, much has happened since my last post (though that's kinda *duh* since i don't post very often). a-kon has come and gone, and no one who was originally going went.  which means that it's that time of year agian- time to buy fabric and start making my next costume.  i feel like going goth/glam/lolita this time.  if i can't find something suitable i'll do something of my own creation. but being recognized is always more fun.

anywho, my grandfather was just admitted to the hosp last night- we thought he had suffered another stroke because of how bad his speech was slurred.  it turns out that he actually has a pretty bad case of pnuemonia with secondary severely high blood pressure.  the slurring of his speech was due to the high blood pressure not getting enough O2 to his brain, so if left untreated, he actually COULD have had a stroke by midnight or early this morning.  i think we're getting to the scary stage in my grandparents' lives- the one where you become really aware of how little time is left to be with them.

well, on a less depressing note- 2 week old kitens with severe upper respiratory infections and heavy flea infestation are SOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE! one of our techs took her in to nurse her back to health instead of letting her be euthanized.  when she's all better she'll be up for adoption.  she's a calico, and her ears look like little round teddy bear ears, and she makes the tiniest liitle mews. agh, she's so cute.  i got to feed her twice yesterday- from a syringe- while she clawwed the heck out of my hand kneading on it.  ^_^

i have also discovered that my mom's laptop has a version of photshop on it (elements) that really has all i need to do the kind of work that i do.  only problem is that i want it on the home pc- is it possible to copy the program to disk and use it that way on the home pc?

and now i realize that it's 2p and i have to run to get to work."

I had no idea she had so many animals- 4 dogs, 8 cats (3 are kittens), 2 horses, and 17 chickens.  and in a few months her backyard will be a wildlife refuge.  while we were down there my mom and I got really attached to one of the kittens, so after she is spayed we'll have a new addition to our family.  when she gets here, all are welcome to visit her!

in other news, I'm very sick.  very, very, very sick- and I keep getting random nose bleeds many times a day.  I have to go to work today, since I haven't been since last weds, but I'll wear a surgical mask so no one else will get sick.

I loved it.  the 1st one was cool and could stand on its own 2 feet, but this one was much more intellectual- much interesting convo was had after the movie too.  sasha- did you catch that the chinese fighter in white in the french guy's palace was one of the guys from Bishounen?  he was the cute little clingy one.

1st, ditched jay on friday to hang with sasha, steph, michelle, and alexis.  i feel bad about it, but at the same time, we were going to go to a club and go dancing, and i had a HUGE nausiating migrain.  and pounding music and flashing lights and smoke are not too good for that.  so instead we all went to denny's.  many hours of fun.
sat morning i had to work.  i was annoyed most of the day, though because tiffany was being pretty pissy and treating me like i'd never even drawn up a vaccine before.  UGH!  anyway- got out of work, went over to see mike in MD.  on the way there was a huge traffic jam on 495- moved about 1 mile in 1/2 hr- took up 3 lanes.  pulling-hair-out-frustration.  got to mike's, and was really pissy with him for about an hour, and all the while he was very nice and trying to help me feel better.  the whole point of going over there was to watch the matrix, so when i de-bitched i sat down for what i was sure would be a disappointment.  obviously, since everyone in the world has already seen the movie, you know i liked it.  it was an odd power trip.  exhilirating, really.  later that evening while i was still with mike, all of a sudden i got really tensed up; my hands clenched up; i lost the feeling in my hands and feet, which spread to my arms and legs and face; and then i started *vibrating* everywhere i had lost feeling.  and that lasted about 1 1/2 hrs.  scary as hell.  so i'll be seeing my doc again soon, with mike this time.  anyway, we made dinner together too.
so today we all had breakfast together in middleburg, then visited mike's rents, did some house cleaning, and just got back from visiting my g-ma in the nursing home.  she looks bad- refusing to eat, really out of it, face hanging.  anyway... still have chores to finish, so i must go.  plus i ought to study for my final tomorrow.
also just found out that kevin will be going to georgetown next semester.  which is a bum.  i'll miss him alot."

i ordered stuff from best buy on 4-16-03, i got an email saying it was shipped 4-18, and my credit card was charged on 4-21, but i still have not seen any sign of my package.  i'm beginning to have no faith in internet ordering, as this is my third non-success in less than 4 months.  i'm also beginning to wonder if someone just stole it?  probabaly leigh.
my family is trying to get away this summer.  we really want to get to st. croix, since its off season down there now, but airfare is still high.  if we stay in the states, travel is cheap, but accomidations are holy-shit-expensive.  either way, it looks like it may not be happening, as always, every year since i can remember.
also, my mom is being really insistent on the whole ""payback what you owe before i'll let you go anywhere on my ticket"" issue.  translation: it looks like seeing megann in arizona this summer won't be happening either.  this makes me especially sad.  i miss megann soo much, but i hear that she may be headed easterly sometime before fall semester.  if so = ^______________^ (very big smile)

 <P>anywho- monday at work was very interesting.  1st of all, usually the clinic brings in about $4k a day- on monday it was $8k, and it really felt like it.  emergencies up the wazoo.  one of which was a cat who had been in labor for over 16 hours and had only had 1 kitten.  x-ray revealed 7 more still in.  did emergency surgery- cut her uteris right out- and all the kittens were born with heart beats, but very cold.  we all sat there for about 2 hours rubbing them, breathing into them, and doing something that looks alot like you're slamming the poor dears into the ground (trying to move the fluid out of their lungs so they could breath).  when they left they were all still living, but i doubt more than 2 actually survived the night.  it all felt pretty rewarding though.

so yesterday- after getting to baltimore at approximately 4:53pm, we (mike and i) drove around for about 20 min trying to find the road that the restaurant was on.  eventually just decided to park in a garage and try and find it on foot, since balmor is horrible about one way streets.  walked about 15 blocks in a circle (while being aambushed by loud abusive homeless men), till we finally happened to see a small sign advertising the restaurant down a street with no street signs- yea that was the street we had been trying to find in the car too.
well, once we got there- Ruth's Chris Steakhouse- what can i say?  it was another world.  absolutely beautiful atmosphere, very courteous and prompt service, and oh my heavenly buddha- the food was ecstacy in every bite.  like butta.  mmmm.  after a long dinner, and complimentary fudge cheese cake w/ raspberry sauce and garnish, we decided to head to the next attration for the evening- le cirque du soleil, Dralion.  this too was a surprise for mike.  since parking is a bitch in balmor, we thought it'd be better to walk to where ever we were going.  ended up being another 20 blocks- think about 3 blocks before the ESPN zone to about 7 blocks after the hotel that katsucon was at in 2002.
ANYWAY, the circus was absolutely amazing.  its great on TV, but a 13"" screen can do no justice to their magic.  every moment you were on the edge of your seat with baited breath, praying that everything would go allright in every stunt.  which, of course, it did because these people are extremely talented and dedicated.  picked up the soundtrack to another one of their circus'- Alegria, my favorite one- beautiful voice that woman has.  one of my favorite acts (in both circus' i've mentioned, actually) involves a person being suspended from the center of the tent on a long sash of fabric, held up by their own strength.  its so incredibly graceful, they look like they're flying, or soaring like an etherial being.  aahhh...., how lovely.

1. cheetahs, cuz they're basically my favorite animal, or foxes, both very stiking in beauty

2. amazonia, which was hard to access due to renovations of one the houses right in front of it.  so we had to walk about 1/2 mile just to get to the exhibit, which was fine, until what happened in that exhibit.  coming down the inside stairs, looking for poisen dart frogs, and kevin makes a joke- it was a stupid joke, but apparently funny enough for me to forget about the stairs.  i fell, twisted BOTH my ankles, and really bruised my bum. ~ embarassing  ^_^; ~ thankfully the ankle-twisting wasn't very bad, so after about 10 min of sitting on the stairs i was able to walk again.  but, oy, the pain!  i was limping pretty badly the rest of the trip.  kevin and i gimped around together for about 2 hours more, and by the time we left for home, both of us were in a lot of pain.
still a very nice exhibit, though.

i just don't see the draw of the pandas- sure they're really cute looking, but ALL they do is sit on their asses and eat bamboo.

one of the more odd things today- at the wolf exhibit, everyone was saying they couldn't see any of the wolves.  walking a little further along, a zoo keeper could be seen asking children if they would like to pet the skin of a wolf, that just happened to be lying over the railing to their enclosure.  internal dialogue: ~so this is what they did with the animals that died a few days ago!~

i almost vomited in the arthropod house. they had a huge corner of one room designated as the ""golden-orb spider webs"", which of course had about 20 of the creeps in it.  ugh!!! and you have to walk past them to get out, which i had to do twice since we missed something on our first trip through.

over-all, though, a very nice time was had.

now must do massiva amounts of homework."

"event","just finished the final piggy lab- big test, which i think i did pretty good on- 24/25.  that was the last test of a week of tests every day.  no such fun.
saw clockwork orange last night for the first time.  still deciding how i feel about it.  the directing was of course awesome, and the cinematography was great too.  the subject matter itself was a bit hard to handle for me at some parts.
i'm going to the zoo on sunday for a bio field trip.  should be fun, since i'll be going with kevin and liz and mita i think.
gonna go see spirited away again tonight.  bringing mike- this will be his first anime movie.  too bad its dubbed, but that will probably be better for him for his first time anyway.
bein kicked out of comp lab now- class coming in."

"event","well, i have a 6-8 page website due by midnight that i haven't had time to even start on yet because of all the other homework i've had this week.  this business about the website due by midnight is compounded by the fact that i will have a scottish girl sleeping in my computer/ guestroom for the next 2.3 weeks- starting tonight.  and BECAUSE she is coming tonight, my mother decided that it would be a better impression on the girl if she were picked up in a car that was made in the past 10 years and didn't smell, and wasn't the machanical equal to gomer pyle.  that of course means MY car!  and i get gomer-wagon, my dad's car.  this i am told AS i'm leaving for school, which of course delays me a good 15 min, since we have to switch all the crap between the cars.  so i was only able to watch 1/2 the movie that was due this morning before school.  thankfully, winkler has a habit of getting carried away with his stories, and never got to the movie ""quizie"" as he calls it.
i have an exam in chem on thursday.  it will be big.  it will be bad.  it will kick my ass.  i am afraid.
off to class.   ^_^;"

"event","i'm feeling oddly like the 1950's B-movie persona ""the blob"".  can't explain it logically.  in stupid class lab now.  finished my lab projects.  still have to finish my lecture project.  this is the part that scares me.  
every once in a while, i smell the preserved piglets.  happened during lunch yesterday- stomach turning experience.  a few minutes ago too.
as of today, i have -$132 in the bank, all from NSF fees.  i should definently not have paid for dinner on weds night with my cc, i should have deposited dawn's check the next morning.  i can't believe my card hasn't been declined the 3 times i've used it since then- twice at Giant before Holly's bye-bye BQ, and once at Sheetz last night.  each of these incidences cost me $32 in fees.  the worst part was that i had only been under by $0.62 on the first incident, which could have been avoided if i had deposited dawn's check the morning after i got it.  grr.  the other 2 would have happened anyway- i didn't have that much money in there to begin with.  and we still have 5 days till payday.
i hate NSF fees.  this year alone i have payed $328 in those fees.  thats my rent right there.  if only i had payed my mom in increments instead of lump sum.  ever since then everything has been really messed up.  before, i ALWAYS had at least $200 in the bank at all times.  i can't wait for my IRS return."

"event","well, not too many things goin on.  lesse... 1) started knitting again, working on a grey ribbed scarf now (its more of a practice project for the ribbing bit); 2) my chemistry prof has fallen ill and won't be completing the semester.  this makes me sad, he was cool, he acted like we were real humans with personalities and had something worthwhile to contribute to our own learning experience.  we are assured that he will not die of his ailment, though this is still not very comforting.  3) my mom came home tonight with a bag from ""Ballywood"".  curious.  ""ashley, i have a surprise for you.""  cool. i wonder... a large tan piece of fabric is pulled from the bag.  then another, more colorful and sheer.  then one more- bright orange.  ??  ""it's a saree!""  *jaw on floor* i break into little-girlish excitement ""YAY!!""  seriously, that really made my day.  iths thso pwetty...  i tried it on, and lo and behold, indians make some comfortable one-size-fits-all garb.  i didn't want to take it off.  my mom said i should wear it to school on the next warm day.  ""no"" - 2 reasons.  1) i'd be afraid that it'd get ruined.  2) i'm not indian in any way.  you can't become punjabi the way you can become muslim or hindu, so adopting the dress is seen more as a costume gesture than as one of clothing thyself.  i don't want to be beaten for ""posing.""  plus, my punjabi friends might take it the wrong way.  hrmph.  oh well, much fun will be had with it anyways.

one last thing.  i hate people who hang out with people they hate, just so they can fill their time with SOMETHING instead of doing something to amuse themselves, just so they don't have to feel like the losers they are.  its really pathetic.

otherwise, and on that happy note, night-night!  ^___^"

"event","yes, i owe that wonderful masterpiece of song to sasha.  hmm, dissecting the pig wasn't as hard on my senses as i thought it might be.  i actually enjoyed it.  the group behind us had a hemaphrodite.  no fully developed vagina or penis, but ovaries and testes, along with the tubes leading to what was missing.  most interesting.  got some preservative splashed onto my face, real close to my mouth.  i had to wait 20 min before i was allowed to wash my face off though.  eww.  i worry that someone will say ""you smell like a dead pig!""  prolly won't happen though, since it couldn't rot with all that preservative.  it was the largest pig in the class, which made identifying organs easier- more fully developed and larger and whatnot.  enough about piglets.

i must file my W2.  i must get money back soon.  must pay parents.

so, real stuff. not much.  i'm not at work, so that makes me happy.  i'm also hogging the comp in the lab, which is pissing other people off, but they're all meatheaded frat boys and whorish sorority girls, so that also makes me happy.  the part about depriving them of this comp, that is.  yup, feeling colder than usual today.  i'm still wearing my big, heavy-duty-warm winter jacket, and i've been in here for an hour or so.  still haven't heard back about my bloodwork results.  think i'll call the dr and leave my cell number."

btw- to holly, matt, darder and anyone else who'll be there- if its all right with you all, i'd like to come and say bye too!  i'll bring meat and sweets, ok?"

"event","ok, so that's not really what i want to talk about.  but come to think of it, i AM extremely hungry.  kevin offered me his turkey sammich today.  i laughed.  it reminded me of how megann and sasha used to make fun of me for liking a high school kid during my freshman year.  ""wan haf my peanut butter and jelly schandwisch?""  
so anyway, went to caps game on sunday- very much fun was had.  caps won.  2:1.  also went to bloomies- finally used my $75 gift certificate.  obtained a mocha colored biniki and a black and white print formal dress.  purty.  
went to mike's family's bull sale last night.  yes, a bull sale.  they own a 5,000 acre angus farm.  their farm, whitestone, is the best in the country.  they were showing me the trophy rooms (plural), and all the pictures of their award winning bulls and heiffers.  one of the bulls, equity was his name, is one of the most famous in the world- when he was sold as a yearling he went for $83,000 for a 1/4 interest!  and his semen was going for $40 a syringe.  sheesh.  anyway, i got home and smelt like cow shit, most literally.
i think i'm just sitting here to waste time, waiting for sasha to call me back, cuz i wanna have lunch with her.  oh well, its getting pretty close to the time for my next class, so i'll prolly go grab something by myself."

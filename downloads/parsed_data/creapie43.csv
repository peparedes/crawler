"event","I had a huge argument with my mom last night. She accused me of not telling her stuff, so I accused her of not telling me stuff either. Unfortunately when she challenged me, I just said that she didn't tell me for a while about her and my dad divorcing. I asked her what I was keeping from her and she simply said that she didn't know that I thought she was keeping stuff from me. Ultimately confusing but oh well.

After getting back from the camp, I've found it harder than ever to know that I'm a lesbian. Every little thing that people say get to me, ""Is anyone on hitting on her, Mike? Do boys come the door"" my step uncle to my dad. And my mom saying I'm hiding stuff. My friends asking me the 3 questions i let them (see my AIM profile) the first one usually being, Are you gay? and what am i supposed to say? they are kidding because it definately isn't possible that a real person they know is. And that comment I just made was sarcastic through and through.

You know, I go to bed crying every night because I don't understand how I can live here, yet now I've realized that I can't keep asking my mom to leave, even jokingly. No matter how bitchy I am, she is going through a lot, and my dad would never let her leave. Poop on him. No, I'm not trying to be funny. I honestly don't know how I'm going to get through the next several years.

The whole camp thing. It was brilliant. It made me forget about reality, but.. well. It was nice. The people were nice. Nicer than anywhere on earth. Honestly. This school year is going to suck."

"event","I haven't put anything in this for a long time, but oh well.
only 17 more days until i can see my beloved pixies. in indianapolis. with sam, alex, and alana. 

I am thoroughly fed up with my ipod. the sound quality sucks.. and it takes forever to put my cds on it. and i hate it. and i also hate babysitting. it's so boring.

only 11 days and 1 hour of school. isn't that stupid? they make us go for a goddamn hour. but i'm not going the last half day, which is after the last whole day, which is the 7th. because, the pixies concert is the 7th, and the 8th i will be coming back from indianapolis. and i will miss school. so haha. now i'd better go read that book for english."

"event","god, i totally cannot stand to live in this fuckin suburb anywaymore. I HATE IT. HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE.
the people are so fuckin boring.. the ONE AND ONLY record store that isnt a chain can't pay the rent unless they charge $15-18 for a cd. there are 3 things you can do on the weekend: go to the mall, sit around with friends and be depressed/sit around alone and be depressed or wish you lived somewhere interesting.. and you can make the best of it, and listen to music.. play music.


but i cant even do that, because my mom fuckin makes me play piano! she wont let me play bass. but im gonna anyway. i'll babysit.. (god, i hate it) cuz its the only way to make money, and i'll buy a bass. and im selling my ipod. i hate it. i really do. its so dumb. and if i sell it, i'll have more money. but i cant sell my cds. no way.

nobody here knows what music is. i talk to people on goddamn pixies sites! its awful. god, this town is totally ruining my life. i am actually counting the days til i can leave. i even try to get good grades in school and im in advanced class so i can graduate high school early.

i hope i can go to lollapalooza. that would be the light of my lightless life. its depressing, isnt it? im going to learn how to knit. it takes up a lot of time. and then, i can sell stuff i knit. yea. i could knit while i babysit. aha, brilliant. 


dedicated is the best song. yea"

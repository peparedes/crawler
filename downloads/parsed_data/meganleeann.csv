Those should feel real nice.

"event","Well... this could possibly be my last entry because livejournal is homo-ish and I dislike everything it stands for. So here's how my last few days have been.

*I'm going to college because I can draw awsome pigs. The guy from Spencerian College said so.
*Me and Sam are going into the advertising business together.
*I'm going to Ichthus the 22nd with either Brandi and Tori or Joel and Alecia. I'm stoked! I have all kinds of friends who are going to meet me up there with their own rides and tickets. Yes Ma'am!
*I have set a goal to lose at least 5 pounds. I didn't eat poptarts this morning. That's how serious I am.
*Jordan told me about how the Germans sank the Titanic. I thought it was the Japanese but he reminded me that that was Pearl Harbor. I got embarrassed. Then I remembered the iceburg.
*I sang a Johnny Horton song to Mr. Muncy and he wasn't impressed by my knowledge of the war of 1941. I'm pretty sure the Bismark never existed.
*My new favorite song is ""In Love With the 80'S"" by Relient K. It makes me laugh.
*Me and Kayla are going on a secret vacation together (wink wink)
*Kayla put me under peer pressure today. Dang her.
*I'm not old enough to give blood.
*Sam says Jesus thinks I'm fat.
*Everyone decided it would be cool to put their initials on my right arm today. It looks awful but I feel popular.
*Joel has told his friend who is a publisher about my stories and he wants to read them. I giggle. That Joel Sheppard is a sneaky character!
*I'm 96.7% sure that the video to ""Helena"" by My Chemical Romance is the cause of my recent paranoia and twitching.
*I heard that the guy who killed Becky has bad nightmares about it. I hope he never sleeps again!
*I wish Stevano was my neighbor. Then he could make me enchilladas any time I wanted them.
*My papaw's birthday was Sunday and he was more concerned about getting a picture taken of his boat for sell in his front yard rather then one of himself on his 81st birthday.
*My papaw calls me MAGNUM and Aleica is LISA. It's my favorite.
*Spanish is a CA-RAZAY language that I have no desire to learn. The only reason I took it is so I can talk to Stevano and he says my spanish sucks. I don't think I talk fast enough.
*The only reason why Ryan Kimble is my friend is because of my extensive knowledge on MC Hammer.
*The goat has made a home out of Scooter's doghouse.
*I'm the newest member of tears for fears


Well, so long."

We had planned on using the 800 dollars our youth group had left and going but we had a meeting and put the money towards something that I think is more important. So sorry kids.

Friday, April 22 : Mat Kearney  John Reuben Thousand Foot Krutch Kutless Teaching Seminars Pillar Charlie Hall Keynote: Mike Breaux Relient K TobyMac Audio Adrenaline

That's the day we're going. Tickets are $38.00 for that one day.  If you can't afford that, I can buy the ticket for you. If you want to go with me we have to leave Friday morning. That means no school that day so if your parents want to talk to mom then they can call her. There'll be at least 2 adults from our church going and it will be really late when we get back... so you'll either need permission to stay at my house or have someone meet you on the way back. I'll have to know for sure if you're going by the end of this week because we have to get the tickets by the 1st. The tickets aren't refundable so I need to know for sure. Go to www.Ichthus.org to see what all is going on."

"event","Well my hands hurt. I started my job today and I have exactly 23 blisters on my hands. I'm proud of them though. I got to start working on the 72 Demon and I was excited. I will probably start painting it next week which is pretty awsome. I can't wait to learn. I sanded the back of it and I had to use a little sharp razor to get all the glue and extra paint off. That's where all the blisters came from. It took me an hour to do that. I cut myself with it on accident a billion times and I thought I couldn't move my hand anymore. I taught my dad how to use 2 way because my uncle kept alerting me while we were working. My dad would talk into it and then push the button. What a geek. And everytime he said something into it he'd say ""Over"" after it. I thought I'd pee my pants.  I got paid which totally dominated. 26 extra dollars to go shopping on tomorrow. I only worked for like an hour and a half today. I'm loving this job already. Well, I had a lot more on here but it was practically pointless so I erased it. I just wasted minutes of my life typing it. I still smell like car exhaust and spray paint. I took a shower too. Maybe the smell is just in my nose. Or maybe I will smell like this for the rest of my life. Mmm. My grandpa turns 81 tomorrow. I'm proud of him. For being alive that is. He's a good man. There's a big shindig at his house tomorrow. I'm so there. We're gonna party likes it's 1999. A woot. A woot. I'm running out of stuff to say so I guess it'd be cool to leave now."

Brian.. that's all I gotta say. It kinda sucked though because I had so much to talk about to Shawn and he wasn't there. After class, me Kelli and Alecia went to Subway and ate fresh. Good stuff. Alecia bought my food for me so I was quite happy about that. Well, I guess no one uses Livejournal anymore. Everyone uses Xanga or Myspace... I tried the myspace thing and I didn't know what I was doing exactly so if anyone would like to help me out I'd appreciate it. I hear it's pretty nifty. I bet I could sleep until Sunday. I would lay 50 bucks on it. But I can't because Logan's birthday party is tomorrow and he stopped me uptown today and asked me if I was going. I had forgotten all about it and I felt so bad. So of course I said yeah. I don't have him a present yet so I will have to go out tomorrow and get him something. That totally cuts into my sleeping time. What do you get a boy who's turning 15? I really don't know. Bless his heart, I never see him anymore. I miss him bunches! Do 15 year old boys play with Ninja Turtles? I know I would. I do actually. I've decided that I want to turn my room into an exact replica of Clarissa's on Clarissa Explains it All... man, that room is what I dream about. But seeing as how I just spent exactly 39483984 dollars transforming everything in my room into Marilyn Monroe, I doubt I could. I keep seeing commercials for the Ring 2 movie and I pee everywhere! I got invited to watch that next weekend but I doubt I will. I can't stand scary movies. They cause me to not sleep and I can't do with out my sleep. Well there's no school tomorrow so that means I'll sleep. I'll sleep until I wake up boys! Good call. Well, I'm going to get off here and.... sleep no doubt. It's all I ever do! Goodnight Children!"

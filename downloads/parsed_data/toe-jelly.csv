This entire blog is dedicated to my obsession with shoes and micelanious pictures of feet... All taken by ME! Huzzah!
<i>[I would like to add that I do not have a foot fetish, or any abnormal fettish for that matter, shoes are just cool]
so... ENJOY!

<h2>What better way to start this blog than pics of my own feet?!</h2>

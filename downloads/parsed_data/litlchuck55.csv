"event","Sunday: After church I hung out with Jay for a little while.  We watched Sandlot 2.  That movie was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  This is simply because it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love movies like that.  They are so terrible they are good.  

Monday night I played hockey with Pinto and the gang again.  It was one hell of a work out.  I gave some of my older equipment to Ricky's little brother Bobby.  I felt good because so many people have helped me with equipment so I got a chance to give back.  Also it's difficult because not many people are smaller than me.  Bobby is.

Wednesday night I spoke at church for the Senior Graduation ceremony.  I was very fluent and sounded like a grown up according to my mother and Jess.  I was also funny and added in the use of Giggidy Giggidy. My right leg was shaking the entire time I was up there but I was able to stay calm in my speech.  It was so weird looking at all the younger kids because I felt like I was in their place just yesterday.  Time really flies.  After that I played hockey at Iceworks with John Weinderman and Alan Hahn.  John is the Islanders radio announcer for those of you who don't know.  Alan is the writer for the New York Islanders in Newsday.    We had a goalie named Ernie who is a real gamer.  He is a 50 year old Canadian who just moved to LI in September.  While in the locker room we had some great hockey talk.  It's cool because I am such a young kid and they are veterans who really know the game.  However, I am able to talk with them because I know my hockey.  They gave me some insight on the old school hockey.  It was only four of us plus Ernie on the rink.  We got the ice for free because we know the guy who cuts the ice.  John was showing me some stretches and giving me pointers on break out plays and rushes up the ice.  He also called me a natural born fore checker.    He has really taken a liking to me which makes me feel so cool.  A guy who knows the game of hockey thinks I am a talented young player.  Anyways I got to put on the goalie gloves and play a little goalie at the end.  I had my regular equipment on with the goalie blocker and catching glove.  I made some diving glove saves which feels so cool.  Afterwards we talked again about the conspiracy over this year Stanley Cup Finals and how the Flames should have won the cup.  Afterwards I was talking to John and Joe( the zamboni man) about Women's hockey.  We discussed the conspiracy of the Women's Olympic Team in 1998 because John's wife was on it but got kicked off.  Stupid Cammy Granato.  

Last night Jess and I saw Batman Begins.  Besides a few cheesy parts the movie was excellent.  I thought the photography was sick and the story was dark and mysterious.  Afterwards we went to Walbaums and bought  stuff to makes smores.  We were inspired by the Sandlot.  We went back to her house and made smores over candles in her room.  It was very original.  We used tweezers to hold the chocolate over the candles.   We had a lot of fun yesterday.  She drove me home and we talked in her car till like 4 in the morning.  I am glad I can be there for Jess.  I want to brighten up her days as much as I can.  Thank you for all the fun we have had all summer so far.


I HAVE TO MOVE.  This sucks big time.  Will my mom ever catch a break.  I really hate all the garbage she has had to go through.  I wish she just wouldn't be so stressed and upset all the time.  Feel better mom."

"event","So the last few days have been pretty filled up.  I brought Jess to church with me on Sunday, which I hope made some sort of internal impact, even if not spoken aloud.  The message was all about faith to endure which is something both me and my mom know a lot about.  I wish my mom was there honestly.  She would love the new pastor as do I.  After church on Sunday I went to an arena football game with Jay and some of my old friends from Island Trees.  Then me and Jay hungout at his house after and played some wiffleball.  I know I am a loser but wiffleball friggin rules.  Sorry it is the third best sport next to ultimate frisbee and hockey.  After that me and Jess hungout for a little but she was getting seepy so she just went home.  

Monday me and Jess went to the beach near her house and we had a catch.  I think it's so cool that Jess is good at sports yet not a tom boy.  She is girly in the girly areas yet can actually engage in physical activites.  She can play them well also.  Our game ended when I crushed the ball into the ocean.  Then we decided to have a little family/friend that you like dinner at me house.  I was feeling upset because other people were talking about doing family oriented things.  So me and Jess went food shopping and bought stuff to cook dinner.  She also took a picture of me wearing a lucky charms hat which looked god awful but it was hilarious.  She sure knows her produce.  She described peas as putrid which is just awesome.  We cooked dinner for my mom which my mom thought was a pleasant surprise.  It was fun although I am not that great of a cook.  Jess and I also did dishes and helped clean everything up.  After that me and Jess when to go hangout with my friends Erica and Jon.  We watched Anchorman which is just insanely ridiculous.  Clearly   Brick is the best character although Ron runs a close second.

Today I started my first day back at Herr's Super Deli.  I love and hate that place all at once.  The customers are still dumb, the food is still overpriced, the owner is still non-existant, the employees are still saracastic.  I love it.  I hate it.  Honestly, the man who added the word super between the word Herr's and Deli subconsciously knew that this deli was going to be a madhouse.  You could be tripping on acid and still wouldn't be able to script stuff that goes on inside the confines of those century old walls and floors.  It was like riding a bike.  I haven't lost it.  I was a different clerk too.  It was nice being back.  I am only working 25 hours this week but it should build up as the days pass.  When I got home I made a makeshift workout bench and decided to start working out again while at home.

Something inside me doesn't feel right though.  I truly  feel melancholy.  One moment I am happy the next  I am feeling uneasy about life.  It's kinda scary.  I also really feel bad for my mom and what happened to her.  Please pray for her for those of you who read this and choose to do so.  So here are lyrics to the song Pull the String off Mudvayne's new album Lost and Found.  I feel lost yet I seem to always find myself  right after that.  The only problem is that I get lost again.  I hate the game of hide and seek.    




Pulling The String

Running I'm alway running from myself
No one to help me
No one knows
Not that anyone who knew would care

Dangling
Hanging from your tree
Am I an ornament of longing
A seed trapped inside the shell that is me
Nobody can save me
From this
From myself

Hurricane of head space
Spinning circle
Stacking up the walls that hide you from yourself
Crumbling pieces of me
An offering to you
Falling gifts from me to you
Leftothing for myself
You had my cake and ate it too
And left nothing for me

Fist
For breaking
These eyes
For seeing
Right through
Heart
For you to trample
Confidence lost
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
From this loss
This right of passage denied
Holding the headstone
Tied to no one
Loosen the knot
Pulling the string

Losing
Feels like I'm losing all my worth
No one to notice
No one would care
If they took the time to stop and stare

Nobody has the time for me
For myself
Blistering pieces of me
I'm giving them to you
These sweet whispers are from me to you
Want nothing for myself

You hold my world inside your hands
And leave nothing for me

Fist
For breaking
These eyes
For seeing
Right through
Heart
For you to trample
Confidence lost
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
From this loss
This right of passage denied
Holding the headstone
Tied to no one
Loosen the knot
Pulling the string

So sorry
For whatever it was I've done
So I'm deserting
Sincerely
Me

Got to just be
You've got to just know
I've got to leave
It's time for me to go

So here's the note
I've left the key
I hope that when you find this
I've left you with a happy ending...

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Fist
For breaking
These eyes
For seeing
Right through
Heart
For you to trample
Confidence lost
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain"

"event","So Wednesday after Meghan left I chilled out for a while.  I went to dinner with Chuck.  Then after that Rachael came over to study Geology.  I was like wow two beautiful girls in my room on the same day go Charlie.  It just sucked that the first time me and Rachael hung out outside of class was to study for Geology.  We had a blast though.  I spilled protein on her by accident but right away cleaned it off her.  She had the services of me whiping her sticky feet.  I am such a nice boy.  We got off task a lot talking about anything and everything.  We seemed to flirt a little bit.  Like when I gave her some peanuts and said, ""Would you like to have some of my nuts.""  I was making her laugh hysterically.  I was even like, ""Your so damn cute.""  Because she says she is a loser but she is not.  She is random like me and it was soooooo much fun.  Too bad we didn't get to hangout outside of class.  I told her we would have had a blast.  I walked her back to her room to protect her from anyone who might hurt her like a gentleman would do.  We talked about the Simpsons and I made her laugh.  She really is so cool even though she doesn't think so.  On the way back I listened to Mudvayne partially because I felt so good about that day and partially because I am a scaredy cat.  I was singing and getting really into it.  I got back to my room and studied for a while.  T.J. came back to my room and apologized about not understanding my ADHD as well as he thought he did.  It felt good because I thought he thought I was annoying.  I also think it felt good because I  respected him as an RA.  I tried to go to bed around four but couldn't sleep.  I wound up staying up all night.  I got into the final on no sleep.  I memorized the questions from previous tests and got done with the first 60 in like 20 mins.  The second half was ehhh but I think I did well.  I think I migh have pulled a 3.8 this semester.  

Right after the final I packed up my stuff and checked out.  Then we helped John move his stuff out.  T.J. had tried to be a sneaky snake and put a waterballoon on my doorknob so it would break when I woke up.  It didn't work so to get him back I had an elaborate plan.   taped a ballon to the top of his window on the outside of his room.  This way when he closed it it would get crushed in the window and go all over him.  I don't know if it worked but it still was a good plan.  We then went to eat at the campus center.  Bereza said some funny comments about thinking that a man was a woman.  We went back to Bombard's and watched a movie and then went to bed.

The next day we woke up and had lunch with Meghan.  She was really cool to get to know and she seemed to like me and think I was funny.  I walked her over to get something done and then we layed on the grass at Collin's for a little.  I wiped the grass off her booty and then we went to Erics room.  I took a nap and they went to visit  Jesse.  I woke up and watched XMen while waiting for them to come back.  When they did we went to Friendly's. The waitress was cool and I made her laugh a lot.  There were some girls their who seemed to be checking me out and being flirty but it was weird.  I got a spit ball shot at me and didn't know how to read that.  They were tall but were probably still in high school.  The one girl stuck her bootaay out while I was walking by.  We then went to Bombard's and jammed for a while.  We played One by U2.  It felt so cool playing drums to a song.  I also rocked the bass in my muscle shirt. We then went to bed.  

We woke up today and went to say goodbye to Eric.  We then helped Bower move more of his stuff.  We then went to Bereza's graduation.  It was nice.  Then for moving his stuff out Bower and his parents took us out to dinner.  It was nice place and I had fun.  After that we went back to Bombards and chilled outside in front of a fire with his parents and brother.  We then jammed for a little and then I showed him some music.  Bombard cut my hair and then I worked out and showered.  It feels cool to like live with a family.  I would have loved to have an older brother

My sister his home and is going to go to a Christian rehab so finally things will become different.  I have also been talking to mymom and it seems God is answering prayer.  Tomorrow's entry will focus on the year in review."

"event","So the last few days have gone by pretty smooth in most areas.  I just took my Communication Theory final and found out that I got a 91.5.  Only 14 other kids got over a 90 and it's a big class so I get proud.  I also took my English final yesterday and it was pretty easy.  I got my paper back from that class and got an 18-20.  I found out I can write college papers, which is good, because I'll be getting a lot of them.  I have still been consistently working out.  I worked out yesterday by myself.  I was the smallest and shortest guy down there but that's ok.  Guys were cheering me on while doing bench press.  When I was trying to put up 145, and kind of struggling, the guy was like, ""C'mon push it.""  I was like ahhhhhhh and put it up 2 more times.     That brought me to a total of putting it up 4 times which may not seem like a lot but I only flipping weigh 135.  I feel so cool lifting a lot of weight.... I'm not gonna lie.  This is especially because I am such a little boy.  Last night things got smooothiied up with Susieeeeee and I hope it stays that way.  The situation still sucks for me but I wanna at least be friendly.  This is just for this point in time.  We will see what happens in the future.  Thanks for calling.  

Today I woke up and did laundry with Tom.  My muscle shirts shrunk and they look good on me.  I still feel weird wearing them though.  But ehhh I'll get used to it.  I then ate lunch with Meghan and Tom on Indian.  I ate like a beast eats.  Tom had to leave to study so after that it was just Meghan and I.  We had a good talk and it seems she doesn't just look at me like some 18 year old hyper boy anymore.  I really don't want people to look at me like that, but I guess I contribute to it.  Then I brought her back to my room and showed her some Mudvayne.  She got interested which is cool because she's from the country LOL.  She was really tired so I am letting her sleep on my bed right now as we write and read.  I have worship music on and am trying to accommodate her as best as me can.  No don't worry it's not like that.  I am just a nice boy.  Guys are all like you have a girl alone in your room go for it.  I am like, ""Hi let me introduce myself.  My name is Charlie and I have morals.""  Plus I already like someone and wouldn't do that.  It's so funny how people automatically assume all guys want some.  Jeez.  It only further propagates the stereotype that guys are asses.  I am not one of those guys.

I have one final left and then I am done.  Honestly, for the most part I hated Albany.  But this last semester I have grown close to a lot of people.  Tom, Chuck and I are the upstanding citizens of Seneca.  Johnny and I are all hardcore.  I have worked out with several people and that's cool.  I loved Impact and the people I met.  Everyone said that I am crazy, funny and hyper.  I will be missed and will miss them.      Rachael became like my best friend all semester.  I did well in my classes.  And most of all I am still straightedge.  The NUMBER 1 PARTY SCHOOL GOT OWNED UUUBERLY!  Now it's almost time to go home and face the music with certain things.  I also have a lot of opportunities though.  It should be an interesting summer.  Well that's it for now."

"event","So the last few days have gone by very smoothly.  Jess and I had another good conversation last night about a lot of different things.  Wednesday was spent mostly studying for Business Law and downloading music and movies.  I now have 2300 songs and 39 movies on my computer.  I couldnt get to sleep Wednesday until 6 in the morning which kinda sucked.  But I woke up at like 1 and studied some more.  I took my final and pretty much owned it vertically, and horizontally.  I think I got an A in that course which is cool.  My teacher was awesome and we learned a lot.  For example did you know that someone could sue you if they get injured while trespassing on your property.  Thats insane.  On the final he put a question that was written like this:
a)yay the course if over no more studying (note this is the correct answer)
b)continue to study over the summer for business law (note this is the incorrect answer)

After the final I worked out with Johnny and bench pressed 145 again which is a big confidence booster.  I always used to suck at bench press and I feel cool now that I can do a lot.  I am such a loser when it comes to being all like yay about bench press.  It's the hardcore strong Charlie and the baby coming out all at once.  

Susie hasn't really been on my mind so thats good.  I'm definitely getting over what she did and that's good.  It lingers, but isn't bothering me as much as it is a shocker.  I think this is mostly because of Jess, my friends, and a jam packed summer ahead of me.  My life has really transformed since becoming a Christian and it really hasn't fully sunk in yet.  I think it's because its still transforming which is so cool to witness.  Anyways today I am going to play frisbee because I love it oh so much.  3 Finals left and then Ohio baby.  It is going to be insane.  


Random Thoughts From the other day:  How is it not clear?  I am just not interested right now.  That is not mean especially when talking about a livejournal that I can't even read.  Words are more important than pictures to me.  What do you want from me right now? I want to be your friend.  But then I think about it and wonder if there is any good reason for me to be your friend at least at this point in time.  You are being friendly to me at this point which is nice I guess, but does it make up for what you did?  At this point probably not.  It's harsh but true.  I still love you and care about you but man is it hard to not get upset or angry.  God will help me do that part.  Don't assume anything.  Don't think I'll find a family like yours.  They are rare although your used to it because you lived with them your whole life.
These words were spoken softly in my mind not in an angry way.     

Whered you go? Did you run away?  Are you lost?  Can you be found?  Only you can find yourself nobody else.  When you do find yourself, do you dare stare the truth in the mirror.  I miss the old you.  Do you miss the old you? Please don't be hurt by my words that this situation has caused me to feel.  Remember Charlie don't try to teach lessons that one can only learn on their own."

"event","Yesterday was me and Rachael's final embarkment on the terrible journey that was Comm Theory.  We only had class for a little so it wasn't that bad.  We got our papers back.  I got a 94 which I am very pleased about.  On my first English paper I didn't do so swell.  So it was nice to know that I can write a college paper and do ok on it. Afterwards we talked like we usually do about life.  It was nice to have someone this year who understood what I was talking about.  I know now I am not crazy.

So last night was the Impact Bonfire.  It was ridonkulous.  This is the new word  me and Tom came up with.  So if you don't like the spelling.... well.... then it doesn't matter because its as friggin made up word.  I went with Chuck to drive to Ted's.  We listened to Christian hardcore and talked about ADHD and stuff.  He has it too so we had a good discussion.  We got there around 8.  It was a bit nippy.  It's friggin May and its still cold.  Damn that wind conducive Albany.  It was fun for the most part.  The bonfire was huge.  Me and Fitz took some funny pictures where we looked like Beasts.  Cuddly beasts though.  After I got back I talked on the phone with Jess for a while.  We talked about how we should play hockey and soccer together.  I brought up how I used to be a soccer goalie but then the nets got  bigger and I didn't so that was the end of that LOL.  I was acting sorta cheesey but assured her it was no lie.  I don't lie with my cheese I stand up LOL.  She thinks I am a dork which is not to be confused with a nerd.  Dorks are cool nerds are just dumb, ironically. 

Recently Simpsons episodes and Family Guy episodes have been relating to my life which is strangely fitting.  Anyway heres some interesting stuff.   I grew some chest hair that was not there about 3.56 days ago.  Has to be the weightlifting.  Also, I think Brand New has the obligation to change their name to Sorta Old and then maybe We've Been Our For a While after a certain time period.  There was also a carpet in our suite bathroom this morning.  I have no idea where it came from.  But that's just awesome.  I mean now my delicate feet will be cushioned by the soft fabrics of what ever the hell carpets are made of.  Awesome.  Anyways I gotta go study for Business Law.  

I am going to be speaking at my church when I go home which is sweet.  I can't wait and I hope people go to the Senior Night to hear me speak."

"event","After church yesterday the ride back to campus was quite insane.
Justine almost killed us several times. I repeatedly said, ""All day"" to
Emanuel. It took us like thirty years to find Price Chopper to drop off
Emanuel. When I arrived back on campus, I ate lunch with Scott, Tom,
Chuck and Stella. Our lunch talk was very interesting. I was very hyper
and made very funny comments on an array of non-related topics. After
lunch I played some frisbee with Scott, Stella, Tom, and T.J. There was
some untimely wind which caused some pretty catastrophic frisbee-like
events. After frisbee I was chillen in my room and received a survey
about study habits. Dennis and I joked about how it would be all
zeros for him, and I should put some crazy number that wasn't even
possible.&nbsp; I am very modestly cocky about my grades and study
habits.&nbsp; I'm such a nerd. But not really.&nbsp; We also talked
about the Psych supplement for Savare.&nbsp; OMG that man is
ridiculous.&nbsp; Thank God I didn't have him first semester.&nbsp; He
makes you by this workbook just so he can obtain more money.&nbsp; It's
basically his textbook with everything blank.&nbsp; You have to fill it
out for him.&nbsp; It is the most insane peice of work ever in
life.&nbsp; We also joked about how our garbage bag is like a body bag
and could be used to hide humans. Muhahhaa. Or you know we could just
throw a loooooot of garbage in there. It reminded me how I have been
obsessively clean all year which is a shocker for me.&nbsp; Our
bathroom isn't on the other hand.&nbsp; It is a private bathroom and
gets used more than the girls from the third floor.&nbsp; It is more open than 7
Eleven.&nbsp; In random news, somebody I know saw Dane Cook.&nbsp; I was
like psahah whoa.&nbsp; We then started imitating all of his
skits.&nbsp; So anyway, later that night I had to start my paper.&nbsp;
This came after I watched the new Family Guy.&nbsp; It was hilarious
besides the fact that it ripped on The Passion.&nbsp; After the
episode, I worked on my paper in Tom's room because my computer is an
evil, evil machine that I have to have utter dependence on.&nbsp; It
took we a while just to write the intro but after that the words came
to me.&nbsp; In the middle of writing the paper I got a phone call from
Susie.&nbsp; It was very unexpected and we talked about some
things.&nbsp; I cleared up most of my emotions.&nbsp; I was very
pleased with how I spoke to her.&nbsp; I got out what I needed to say
in a firm but respectful manner.&nbsp; I was actually asking God to
present a situation so I can restate my words.&nbsp; I had previously
talked to Susie's parents and Aunt about it and I felt like an
adult.&nbsp; I like how I can talk with older people and still
understand a lot of what they are saying.&nbsp; Especially when it
comes to life situations.&nbsp; Anyhow,&nbsp; I still have some things
I would like to say but I will wait until the situation cools
down.&nbsp; After that I finished my paper by like 2:30 in Tom's
room.&nbsp; I was quite happy with the way it came out.&nbsp; I
couldn't fall asleep though.&nbsp; I couldn't stop thinking about
certain things.&nbsp; At 4 in the morning, I got the sudden urge to
listen to music.&nbsp; I put on my Ipod and took about my
drumsticks.&nbsp; I just started  drumming on my wall, legs, and fan while
listening to it.&nbsp; I was getting so into it.&nbsp; I really want to
be a drummer for something.&nbsp; I will try to be next year at
Messiah.&nbsp; I fell asleep around like 7 and woke up at 10.&nbsp; I
fell asleep with my drumsticks.<br>
<br>
I edited my paper real quick and went to Geology.&nbsp; Rachael didn't
go which made it super boring.&nbsp; We had to fill out
evaluations.&nbsp; I joked with some kid about how we should fill in
the female bubble instead of the male.&nbsp; Nobody wouldn't notice
because it is anonymous.&nbsp; We would screw up the whole
system.&nbsp; And no one would ever know.&nbsp; Except of course for
those of you who read this.&nbsp; After the class I talked to my
teacher about evolution.&nbsp; I told him I didn't believe in it.&nbsp;
He's a flippin geology teacher.&nbsp; And I told him I don't believe in
evolution and the Big Bang Theory.&nbsp; He must have peed his pants.&nbsp;
After that I had my final English class.&nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; We
handed in our crap and filled out evaluations.&nbsp; Afterwards I went
up to my English teacher and told her how I loved the class and how I
might minor in English.&nbsp; I joked about how I hated reading coming
into college and this class caused a shift in my mindset.<br>
<br>
After that Bombard, Scott, and I worked out.&nbsp; I benched 145 lbs.
That is more than I weigh.&nbsp; I was so surprised with myself.&nbsp;
I also lifted 55 lb dumbells on another excercise.&nbsp; I love that
number.&nbsp; Right after that we went to First Monday at Grace
Church.&nbsp; I have loved Manday Monday all year and this was the
final one. &nbsp;&nbsp; We got to eat dinner there like usual.&nbsp;
I had 3 plates of food.&nbsp; Ridiculous.&nbsp; We then went into
worship.&nbsp; I was drumming on the chairs and singing at the same
time.&nbsp; I loved all the songs they played.&nbsp; They were, Blessed
Be The Name,&nbsp; Here I am To Worship, and&nbsp; Open the Eyes of My
Heart.&nbsp; We had to leave early to go to Mikey's concert.<br>
<br>
We got there at 8 exactly.&nbsp; I drove with Chris.&nbsp; We talked
about things in my life which was cool. &nbsp;&nbsp; We listened to
Norma Jean.&nbsp; They are Christian hardcore, which I never knew. At
the concert, I got to see the Percussion Ensemble perform.&nbsp; It was
awesome.&nbsp; I was actually able to play along with an African song
they played simply by looking at the kid drumming.&nbsp; I can't read
drum music too well but I can play stuff by watching and
listening.&nbsp; It reminded my of my band days and how I really want
to become a drummer in something.&nbsp; I have been thinking about that
a lot recently.&nbsp; We chilled outside the concert hall a little bit
afterwards.&nbsp; Fitz and I were doing some wrestling stuff like
little boys.&nbsp; I then came back to Indian and that's been it
recently.&nbsp; Tomorrow is my last Comm Theory class with
Rachael.&nbsp; We had some fun times in class.&nbsp; I will miss
it.&nbsp; Then starts finals.&nbsp; The first one I will own is
Business Law on Thursday.&nbsp; I hope you feel better Jess.&nbsp; I
will make you laugh and keep you company.&nbsp; <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><br>"

"event","Yesterday I watched The Simpsons while everyone else was getting sloshed.  Ain't I a tool. (Ironic)

So today I woke up at like 9:45 but didn't get out of bed until like 10:12.  I got all snazzzzzzzy for church.  I wore a shirt and tie which was something I haven't done in a while.  Besides the little gash of hairlessness in my head I looked pretty good LOL.  I went outside and thought my ride had left which would have sucked.  It is going to be one of the last times I see George in a while so I wanted to go to Loudonville.  My ride wound up coming which was cool.  The sermon was great.  I took notes like a little nerd.  Yes I know I am a loser.  The pastor talked about vital relationships within the church and how Christians should have relationships with others outside the church.  He brought up a good point.  He said, ""How can you a relationship with God (invisible)  if you can't have one with human followers (flesh). He talked about how too much bible teaching can create pride and arrogance but you still need it as a foundation.  And how relationships are key.  It applied to my life right now.  I am on fire for God but get too proud.  I don't like that.  I confessed my sins of the last month.  I apologized for what I have done to others as well as myself.  I need to change Charlie for Charlie and nobody else.  Sometimes I feel like I learn lessons a second too late.  Then I can't change the past and it kills me.  So then I want to take action to change the previous wrong action.  And sometimes action is the worst thing to do in some situations.  I need to step back.  Cool down.  After the service I spoke to the speaker and the Pastor of the church.  He asked me if I felt called to ministry.  I was like uuhuhfwhats.  Maybe I will be a youth minister.  How cool would that be.  I will act just like the kids when I am like 37 because of my ADHD.  He gave me a book called Basic Christianity.  It was cool. The first page talked about how young adults dislike institutionalism in the church but love the big J.C.  He is a really nice guy.  I told him a little about my background and how it was similar to George's.  That's it for now.  I'll probably be writing again soon.  For all 2 of you who are interested."

"event","So here is an entry on just my general thoughts.  Lately I have been thinking about life and who I am and maturity and what others are like.  I have come to this conclusion that consistency is difficult to find in the words and actions of most kids my age.  Saying one thing one day and than another thing the next is not consitency even if you believe one thing strongly one day and something different the next.  Values are also different from actions and meaningless unless applied in real life situations.  I have also learned that I try too hard and am too apologetic.  Sometimes stepping back and taking no action is the best action.  The further you push someone the more they will pull away.  So for this I am sorry for pushing.  I am sorry for the drama even though I am not my mom.  This doesn't give someone the right to curse at her.  However, you created this situation.  And it is not mostly my fault.  It takes two to not get along.  I also don't like the words, ""I guess so.""  It implies stubborness.  I don't think you did anything on purpose but do think someone things should have obviously not been done.  Confidence in the heart is a lot more important than confidence through words.  Changing isn't neccesarily maturing.  I also gotta not try to teach people lessons that they don't want to deal with or can't deal with.  Some lessons are learned on your own.  Not dealing with things is the simple way out but builds no character.  I can't believe how things have changed from caring to not wanting to talk to unless I am dying.  That is not care.  I still care for you and would do more than just pray.  I don't mean to sound like a preacher but someone people need to hear certain things if they don't come to conclusions on their own.  Squidgily was our term.  You shouldn't be supporting someone who wants to kick someone's ass when it is not their fault.  You can't control someone elses actions and their actions should not be seen as mine.  There is a such thing as a half truth.  Maybe  you have been harsh to push me away.  But it is still not right.  I am not an object to either be dealt with or not.  I am a human and expect to be treated like one.  Regardless of how you view me.  I want the drama to end as well.  I hate drama.  But I also don't like mean people.  I had a good talk to today with Jeane.  She is really smart and we talked about a lot of things.  My Ipod and computer are also working which made me happy.   Anyway that is all for now.  Is caring the same as love?"

"event","So the last couple of days have been interesting.  Classes went fine although they were boring.  Jess and I have been having a lot of fun talking on the phone.  She is a really smart person when it comes to life situations.  I can tell her some interesting things and she will understand where I am coming from.  I can't wait to come home in the summer and hangout with her.  Yesterday I watched the Ghostbusters with T.J. Tom and Chuck.  That is a great movie.  Dan Akroid is uberly funny.  Everybody else in Seneca was extremely drunk.  So Tom, Chuck and I decided that we are going to make a facebook group called the Biggest Drunks in Seneca.  I love the irony.  Chuck has drank two beers and a shot.  Tom and I have both never drank.  So theres some good news when I come home in the summer.  I might be a youth leader at my home church.  This is awesome because I would have never thought that they would have chose me.  I was the one who was the most skeptical dude there was.  But God transforms people and it's awesome to see.  My mom has done some things in the last two days that have bothered not only me but others.  However, I have talked to a group of parents who still love me and care for me.  Thanks for the advice and the reassurance.  It also seems like those other people are going to get bothered at me even though they said they wouldn't.  I've been cursed and threatened to have my ass kicked by someone who doesn't even know the full situation.  But that's ok because I'll just go hockey style LOL.  J/K I am not a fighter.  I am a hockey player.  (Irony).  A particular person has also said that they don't want to talk to me unless I am dying.  This same person said they care about me.  Hows that for caring.  I am also becoming a preacher which is apparently a bad thing.  Although we as Christians go to church every Sunday to hear someone preach.  I am no pastor by any means but do like to help others.  I will apologize for anything I have done in the last month and just let the situation cool.  I am still hurt by some things that occurred but I can't change things no matter how hard I try.  Sometimes me trying to hard is a bad thing.  You just have to keep things simple sometimes.  My conclusion to this situation so far is that 18 year olds are immature.  No matter how mature we think we are we are not.  I am 18 thus I am immature as well.  I do believe however that when humans experience things in life like pain it builds character an maturity.  This is only when that person takes that pain and allows God to make a transformation in that human.  I have also learned that God knows what's in your heart even when you don't or when you think you know better.  He has taught me a lot and I hope it can help me in the future.  The timing of all these events that occurred really sucked.  I was so ready to be Charlie again.  But my mom messed that up and so did a certain situation.  But you know what I still am Charlie even if certain people don't see it.  Some things are meant to be learned but never are.  I can't be the one to teach everybody so I will stop that right now.  Some of the greatest lessons learned are the ones on your own and through dealing with a rough situation.  

I just want to say thanks to the people who have helped me through this time.  You gals are very admirable.  I can't wait to come home and kiss you.  You know who you are.  I am going to squidgel you all over and we are going to rub noses together."

"event","So Monday kinda sucked.  All my songs got deleted from my Itunes again.  Itunes is an evil evil mean terrible program that is also my best friend because I have an Ipod.  The end of Monday was pretty cool because I talked to Jess on the phone.  We had laughs and there was some serious talk as well.  I didn't fall asleep till like 4.  

Tuesday was awesome and jam packed.  I had Comm Theory with Rachael as usual.  We joked about getting rocked in the face with an apple because I was eating one for lunch.  I then said that that would make the statement that, ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away,"" ironic as you were heading to the hospital after getting faced by our juicy green friend.  Then she said that it would be a lot worse if it were a watermelon.  I agreed.  Watermelons are huge and thus would hurt that much more.  Some girl behind us was a tool and was like, ""Can you two please be quiet.""  I felt like telling her to go take a long walk off a short cliff.  We only laughed for like 3.2 seconds anyway.  Then I walked her to her room after class and we talked about her on the way back.  We also talked about the year and how we will miss the fun times we had in terrible classes.  Then after that Bombard and I worked out for an hour.  I am really getting strong.  I lifted 50 lb dumbells on each arm doing the incline press.  Two words baby: Ridic ulous!  I think I might go out and buy some wife beaters since I am bulking up LOL.  Then after that we played frisbee in the field and we were making crazy under the legs catches.  I got rocked in the face once and was quite embarassed.  My lip felt swollen.  I need a bandage or maybe just a kissy.  I know who could do that hehehe.  Right after that my day continued with going to prayer night at Christ's Church.  It was the first time I went and I wish I had gone more times this semester.  I prayed for My mom, Jess, Me, Jesse, Susie, and the world.  Then we did like a worship time.  However, in between we were allowed to say something that God put on our hearts.  I talked about my sister and my mom.  And I prayed for them while on stage into the mic.  Then we sang Here I am to Worship and I got really into it.  I put my hands up and sang loudly projecting my voice.  I might not sound like a professional but I think I am pretty good when I actually sing.  Then after that I joked about how I wanted to be a hockey player when I was younger but God made me short for a reason.  He wanted me to help people.  So I gave a little background on my past and talked about how I will use my past to help others.  I see God's plan for my life and it feels good.  I am getting really comfortable with speaking on stage now.  My thoughts flow very nicely and I don't say like as much or stutter.  I also look up at people and am getting a better vocabulary.  I like the word prevalant.  I also got to play the electronic drumset while Bombard and his brother were singing afterwards.  I used the double bass drum.  Guess what we played?  U2.  Bombard happens to like them a lot and knows their guitar parts.  We played Beautiful Day.  People said I sounded good.  I was really going crazy.  I played the double bass and still kept a good beat.  YAY me.  I am such a little boy. After that we rushed back to the campus to eat at the Campus Center because meal swipes are a poor student's best friend.  We had a car race against Shelly's 1964 peice of crap car.  It won.  I was shocked.  We got there and I ate like a beast.  I had a whole sub after having a whole plate of spaghetti earlier.  Working out makes Charlie hungry boy.  While eating with two girls from Impact, Eric and I were ripping on each other because of where we are from.  It was hilarious.  I call him Buffalo Bill and he calls me Energy H because of ADHD.  When I got back to my room I got protein from Nick which is sweet.  I could use that to gain muscle weight.  Now all I need is color and I am set for the summer.  Watch out ladies Charlie is a ripped tank.  Actually only a few ladies have to worry.  That's it for now."

"event","So yesterday was really cool.  I only had one class which was Communication Theory.  It sucked.  Then I played frisbee with Bombard and these kids from Tuscarora.  They had no stamina and we dominated.  There was this kid Joe who played who I can't stand because he always made fun of me for being a Christian.    After that me and Bombard worked out.  I now have two nicknames: Beast and Energy.

Today I had Geology with Rachael.  She looked very perty.  We also talked about this whole Susie thing and she gave me some words of encouragement.  I am too nice sometimes.  I have come to that conclusion.  We are having dinner tomorrow with this girl Tara as well.  It should be fun.  Tara is very entertaining to watch eat.  Next I had English. We went outside.  We read a story about androgynous life forms which was cool.  I was also making the whole class laugh which made me feel really good.  Then I worked out with Bombbard again.  Then we played frisbee with Eric.  I was diving all over the place and making nice catches.  Then I went to Impact worship practice.  I played drums which was cool to do for the first time with other people.  I definitely want to play at Messiah.  I talked to Greg about speaking at youth group and he said it was cool.  He was glad to hear that I am doing well.  Impact was tonight as well.  I got a plaque signed by George and Ryan for my Baptism.  It was really nice of them to do that.  Then because of a bet we had at Impact to sell 10 t shirts, I jumped in the fountain.  It was cold but epic.  I chased a duck all over the fountain like a wild crazy boy would.  Then I tried to hug George while sopping wet.  He smooshed a cupcake in my face.  Good times had by all.

Last night I talked with Jess on the phone till like 3:37.  It was a really good conversation.  She would tell me to tell stories that she knew I already told her.  I would start saying them and get all excited. Then she'd tell me I already told her that one.  But her giggle was too cute to get upset at.  We also talked about art and music a lot.  She really know a lot about drawing and its interesting to hear.  I am not into art really but I get easily interested in that kinda stuff.  We also made a bet about Billy Madison.  I hope I lose the bet hehe.  We also made funny rules about getting off the phone.  She also liked my grrr and though it was cute.  Well that's all for now.  Next entry will be about my thoughts at the moment of this situation.  Read it if you want to hear the truth.  The truth can be scary.  Especially when it's about lies."

"event","So the weekened was very interesting.  Jess came up on Friday night and we hung out for a while and listened to a bunch of different music.  It felt good to have some one visit me because I have been feeling very lonely.  I talked to her about God a little bit and we listened to some praise songs and it was soothing.  I was also wearing Simpsons pajama pants and we were trying to find the comic book guy.  I made a joke how he was getting scared that we were after him so he was running away.  Clearly I wouldn't have bought the pants if I knew he wasn't on them.  We went to bed at like 6 in the morning.

Saturday we went to Boston for the day.  It was really fun for the both of us.  We really related to each other and we had a bunch of laughs.   We blasted Mudvayne and she really liked the song Happy?.  So we played it over and over. When we got to Boston we saw Fenway Park.  We also saw the Fleet Center and tried to get into BU's new hockey arena but we couldn't.  We visited Jess's sister and heard about her crazy roomate.  I came up with the Charlie Kick in The Face Theory which basically states that someone who is crazy and doesn't have ADHD should get a swift kick in the face if they are out of line.  Jess's sister is really mean to her and it bothers me.  We also walked through Harvard.  Oh boy.  They have the personality of mops.  We then ate dinner and got Mike's Pastries.  On the ride home we talked about God again and I really have grown to love her.  I really care about her and it would hurt if anything bad ever happened to her and it already has.  We started to watch a movie but didn't finish it.  We wound up laying together and I hugged her and we cried.  Then she started to go to sleep.  I then prayed over her body with my hands on her shoulder as worship music was playing in the background.  She got up in the middle of the night, kissed me on the cheek and said thank you.  Helping people feels so good.

On Sunday she left early and I gave her a huge hug.  Then was Fountain Day.  We had a huge pillow fight.  Some girl got rocked in the face and her nose bled.  Then I went in the Fountain (with no shirt on because I'm a beast) and was having so much fun.  The water was like a bajillion degrees below zero and I was turning like purple as was Rachael and Meghan.  So after we got out Scott and I gave them our shirts because we are nice caring boys.  We then played volleyball and I was a little maniac.  I also wrestled two guys twice my size and almost took them.  Then I ate dinner with kids from Impact which was ridiculous.  I felt like I was sooo funny.  The table talk was really cool.  

Today was fun.  I went to English and then played some hardcore frisbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  Then me and Bombard worked out we ate dinner and went to something at Grace Fellowship on sexual integrity.


I have lost a lot of respect for Susie because she lied to me.  Things are turning out really brutal and I am really angry at her.

Don't tell me what I want 
Don't tell me what I need
Don't tell me how I need to feel
I feel, nothing
Dig the eyes out of my face and I can still see right through you.

""(Per)Version Of A Truth""

When everything is lost (peel it all away)
Haunting us with questions (asking)
Will we...
Ever find the smile inside (no), is it hidden
Behind the sweating eyes (bleeding)
Dead inside a scream that's pouring from me

I'm planted in this skin, (constricting and pulling me)
This dirty filthy skin(rancid and stinging me)
I burn behind the walls,(that have become my world)
The bearer of a gift, forget your gift

Truth does not exist,
But the lies do......

They're buried in the skin,

Evolved

Perversion of a truth I'm stuck there,
(Inside of lies buried in me, why)
Alone
Born into a world never asked to be here
(Try to forget truth doesn't exist, truth)
(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, truth)
Daath......

always inside a tragedy (things never seem to go away)
A room that I remember, (portraits I carry)
Try letting go of this space (bad habits can't kick me)
The fool that fell from heaven, heaven...

Perversion of a truth I'm stuck there,
(Inside of lies buried in me, why)
Alone
Born into a world never asked to be here
(Try to forget truth doesn't exist, truth)
(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, truth)

Maybe we're all the children of a star,
Misguided in direction, our misdirection
Pardon me while I pray for light

I'm not the only one,
that walks between the rain, there are many.
I'm not the only one,
When everything is lost that doesn't surrender

Perversion of a truth
I'm stuck there (Inside of lies buried in me, why)
Alone
Blind walking through a world
I never asked to be here

Versions of the truth...
I'm not the only one...
Lies!"

"event","I have some mixed emotions right now about certain issues and so I felt this was an appropriate song to post.  Are you happy?  It is either a simple answer or a complex one.  I don't know which answer I have right now.  I just no I am not too happy.  


""Happy?""

In this hole
That is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole
Thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

I feel it in me
So overwhelmed
All this pressure centerizing
My life overturned
Unfair the despare
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole
That is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole
So limiting
The sun has set; all darkens 

Buried underneath
Hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Are you
HAPPY

Are you
HAPPY

Are you feeling happy?

In this hole
That is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release??
What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Peel me from the skiiiiiiiiiin
Peel me from the skiiiiiiiiiin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the boooooooooone
Tear me from the boooooooooone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you #$%%^@% happy?
Now that I'm lost left with nothing

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you $#%&%#%* happy?
Now that I'm lost left with nothing?"

"event","So on Tuesday was the Mudvayne concert.  The concert was ridiculous.  I took the trip with my friend John and his two friends Matt and Pat.  I met Susie at the venue.  The other bands that played were alright but when Mudvayne came on I regained my once lost energy especially in my legs.  I crowd surfed like 4 times, one of which I was screaming the lyrics to Silenced right in front of Chad's face.  In the moshpit I was jumping around like a mad man.  I got rocked in the head, neck, and ribs but I am fine.  There were actually times where I'd be the only person in the middle and people on the outside would just watch me and cheer me on.  I felt so crazy.  Susie saw me mosh a little and was probably scared.  We sung some songs together and although she hasn't listened to Mudvayne in a while and didn't have fun at first, she had fun once Mudvayne came on.  She said they definitely put on a good show and she likes Chad a lot.  He is really awesome.  Not only does he and the rest of the band have great stage presence but he has a heart.  In the intro to World So Cold he talked about the bravery of the soldiers overseas and the unity of New York that was evident during September 11th.  Susie and me flirted a little bit and I kept her safe as I promised.  I had a lot of fun with her and I hope she had fun too.  She said though that she looked at me and had no feelings for me but that's ok it was only a Mudvayne concert.

After the show when Susie was picked up the three of us went over to Virgin Megastores to meet them.  They were awesome.  Ryan thought I was crazy for telling him he is the best bassist in rock.  My friend talked to him next and when Ryan was like, ""This kid is crazy,"" my friend was like, ""You don't understand how much this kid loves you.""  Ryan smiled.  I told Matt that I was a drummer and that he is amazing.  He had the funniest most modestly cocky reaction of, ""You don't need to tell me that I know.""  I told Chad about how his lyrics were inspirational and how I know what real bad parenting is about.  He gave me like a half hug and a pat on the back and said a heartfelt thank you.  After the show we made a crucial stop to White Castle where we had to wait like 30 years because the people in front of us ordered like 40 burgers.  After that we slept at the kid Matt's house.  Johnny told me that for a kid who has never drank or done drugs I am pretty flippin nuts.  It was a compliment.  

The next day we came back up very early in the morning.  We got a speeding ticket on the way home which was kind of interesting.  That night at Impact clips of Miracle were shown and I related to them to Christianity bein a family.  Then after that I spoke about what I learned this semester and my life story.  I was so cool calm and collective and people said I did really well.  I felt proud.  That is the first time I have spoke like that in public and didn't have stage fright.

Today Communication Theory was very fun simply because of Rachael.  We have sooo much fun writing our notes back and forth to each other during class.  It is so child like but it's cute.  I make her laugh a lot and it makes me feel confident.  I also told her I had a teeny crush on her and she said that was cute.  She really is just such a cool person to be around.  I was about this morning till about like 4 writing my paper which came out really good.  Thank God it's over.  Now I can breather until finals.  I then got a package from my mom after class containing my Mudvayne cd poster and t-shirt.  It also contained cotton socks and pens which are crucial to my life right now.

Me and Susie decided to start with a clean slate with each other.  She finally admitted to how she has been acting recently and it was a relief.  It was painful for her but pain is the best way to learn from mistakes and change yourself.  It's not the easy way out but it's the healthiest.  We still have some things to work out but I think it was a good step for us.  I was glad I could comfort her and I will help her on her way to changing for the better.  If theres anyone who knows about change its me.  That's all for now."

"event","So today was tiring, fun, and stressful all at once.  I went to bed at 8 this morning and woke up at 11 which sucked.  My sleep pattern is upside down.  It started with a trip to my English teacher's office. There was Geology before that but that class is terrible so it doesn't matter.  She is really cool and we had a short but sweet discussion about my writing and my thoughts.  I then met up with my T.A. from my Comm Theory class.  He's a really cool kid.  We talked about music, and Social Cognitive Theory (boatloads of fun).  It actually was fun.  I am relating my paper to Office Space which is sweet.  I then had to write a bibliography for it.  Ok here is where I rant about how bibliographies are the worst thing on the face of the planet and make you want to kill the person(s) who invented the need for the and throw your computer out the window and then say, ""I immediately regret this decision,"" and find the creator of Microsoft word and stab him in the neck with a pencil because identations aren't supposed to be difficult but take 100000000000000000000000000000 years and then take a nap.  I was cranky and then got into an argument with someone which was anoying.  I hate aim sometimes.  The lack of a tone of a voice leads to a lot of misinterpretation between humanoids.  I was cranky, yes, but both people argued.  I also dislike capital letters.  They are scary.  The conclusion from the argument was that words are misinterpretated, and you shouldn't always think you know what someone means by something.  That and that both women and men are nuts.  But it was resoloved and that's jim dandy.  The Mudvayne concert is tomorrow and I can't wait to go nuts.  Thanks Jess for all your doing for me.  

No more playing games.  I know you don't mean to but I can't really afford to be confused at this point right now.  Get your thoughts straight I'll get mine straight and we will be ok.  Do you want to have fun?  Do you want to date?  I will refuse to be toyed with or jerked around.  Also, I do believe talking to someone isn't a privelage.  But that's just my opinion.  I also will not disrespect myself physically.  We will talk about this again when we are both focused, and both not with a lack of sleep.

Just know I don't know exactly what I feel but that doesn't mean I don't feel anything.

We will have fun tomorrow and take things from there"

"event","Today was very tiring but very fun.  I woke up to ambigous away messages of ""I'm up Call me""  and ambigous profiles.  I didn't know if someone was trying to be ambigous or just trick me.  Then I ate what the cafeteria likes to call eggs.  Then I was called by Bombard Eric to play ultimate frisbee.  Man I love that game.  I ran like a maniac as usual making diving catches and getting my knees nice and grassy.  After that we went to try to work out.  It was closed so we just went up to Eric's room to do some push ups and stretches.  I think I am going to work out and take protein in the summer to get bigger.  They told me about Kung Fu.  I am going to do it.  Just so I can say ""I know Kung Fu"".  After that we walked to Jesse's house and on the way me and Eric were making fun of each other because he's from Buffalo and I am from Long Island.  I was calling him Buffalo Bill and Country Boy.  We then talked about the hilariousness Office Space and how Michael Jackson would make a good pshycopathic killer in a movie.  After that we were heading back to the room and stopped to see some people playing soccer.  Me and Bombard played with these kids from Ghana who are really good.  I had some nice moves and they told me I was oober fast.  That's when I got my new nick name from Eric which is ""Energy"".  I told him as a going away gift I would buy an energy drink and tape a picture of me in my ""epic"" orange hat on it.  After that we ate dinner.  When trying to take napkins on our own we were stopped by the ""Napkin Patrol"" here on campus.  He was like a security guard in an apron standing behind his little fort made of condiments and napkins.  I then agreed with him and said that if someone tried to steal my napkins I'd get pretty pissed also.  After that I came back to my room and Matt gave me a makeshift haircut.

Things are going well for me now.  My confidence with women has gone up and I am getting noticed by people who are saying hello and talking to me. I am still a little like ehhh because Susie is not responding to my stuff and she always got sad when I didn't do it to her.  I hope she isn't like annoyed or getting jealous when I talk about other girls.  But hey, she talks about Eugene and makes it obvious to me how she is like in love with him so hey.  She is being a little in the dark about certain things and I don't know why.  

I also want to increase my vocabulary and get into like picture taking.  I don't have a camera but after seeing cool pictures today I wanted to take some of me in cool spots.

Susie also said she didn't want to put any effort in to get Mudvayne's autograph.  It didn't make sense because she is going to be standing anyway.  But I guess there are somethinhgs I just won't get.  She also when talking about tanning said, ""I want to get tan for the prom"".  I don't know if she is saying that to upset me but it is kinda bothering me.  She has also said she was going to tell me things about the emails on the phone about my myspace comments and emails and she never has.  I am not going to bother her about it but she is making promises and it seems as if she doesn't want to put much effort into it.  I also hope she has asked her parents and gotten everything straight for the concert and I hate to ask her about it again but sometimes she needs to be bugged to do something.

Lastly, tomorrow I am getting baptised which is really cool.  I can't wait.
Well thats it for now"

"event","Would you be sad if I died because I know you ""didn't mean it"" but your killing me.
That is life!  

Sheltered life innocence,
Insulated memories, spark reflections of my head,
Duality in my consciousness,
Caught in the war of hemispheres,
Between the love lost in my head,
Mommy do you still live inside of me,
I'm so lost in my life without any guiding,
Protected me my whole life from everything.

God knows all your thoughts whether you pretend he does or he doesn't.  It's you who choose whether or not to act righteously on those thoughts.  It's ok for your thoughts to change but it is very frustrating that I didn't see this kind of thing happening.

Maybe I'm just angry but It's still the way I feel and I can't help that!"

"event","When passion's lost 
And all the trust is gone 
For way too far 
For way too long
Children crying 
Cast out and neglected 
Only in a world so cold 
Only in a world this cold 
Hold the hand of your best ..........friend .......... (love)
Look into their eyes 
Then watch them drift away 
Some might say 
We've done the wrong things 
For way too long 
For way too long 
Fever inside the storm 
So we're turning away
Away from the game 
Away from the storm 
It's like through mending the worlds of us 
Keep your thorn 
Cuz I'm running away 
Away from the games 
Away from the space 
The circumstances of a world so cold 
Burning whispers 
Remind me of the days 
I was left alone 
In a world this cold 
Guilty of the same things 
Reveled by the cause 
I've left alone in a world so cold 
Fever inside the storm 
So we're turning away 
Away from the game 
Away from the storm 
Its like through mending the worlds of us 
Keep your thorns 
Cuz I'm running away 
Away from the games 
Away from space 
The circumstances of a world so cold 
I'm flying 
I'm flying away 
Away from the games 
Away from the flames 
The circumstances of a world so COLD 
Why does everyone feel like my enemy 
Don't want any part of depressional darkness 
I've had enough, sick and tired, 
Bring the sun or I'm gone 
or I'm gone, I'm packing out, I'm no more no motherf**kin' shit 
Never lied, never loved, never lived, never lost, never hurt
never worried about being afraid, 
Of anyone else, not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about
anything, 
Packing out, giving up, no motherf**kin' shit never lived, never
lied, never lived, never
lived, never loved, never loved, never hate never worried about
being afraid, 
Of anyone else, not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about
anything, 
I need to find a darkened corner, 
A darkened corner, A blackless corner 
where its safer and calmer 
I'm drowning away, away from the game away from flame 
Cause I feel mending the worlds of us, 
I'm running away, away from the game away from this space 
Of circumstances of a world so cold, 
I'm flying, I'm flying away, away from the game away from the
game 
Of circumstances of a world so cold."

"event","I should hate you for what your doing to me, but I only hate the fact that i love you and can't have you forever (now).
My grip needs to be loose so it can once again be tight but my grip always wants to be tight. 
This is so you'd never slip away.
You've slipped away because of my tightness.
This space has created a whole.... in my heart.
A hole that was once filled.
A hole the that was once filled for good after once being empty.
Now its filled only with a hollow air and the cycle has just restarted.
Only you can stop the cycle or so I once thought I knew.
Will you stop the cycle will it be you?
Will you fill the whole... hole you drilled.
I have created a hole for you, a hole I once filled.
Can we fill these space together?
Only time will tell.
I wish I was time. 
I wish it was time.

Do you know how badly this hurts?  Do you know?  Do you know?  Do you dare to know?  I wish you knew so you could create a perfect dosage of compassion for my aches.  Do you know what it's like to truly be rejected and abandoned?  Do you know what it's like to be yelled at.  Have I truly yelled at you.  If I have I'm sorry.  Why am I asking so many questions.  I know you hate it. Answer them only in your heart.  
I am soooooooo sorry but I shouldn't have to apologize to myself.     

Memories: Of opening up eyes to the world.  I can only open them so far but God will do the rest.  I know he will.  Even if the time is not now the time will come. 

Please don't hate me I've had enough of that already.
Do you love me?  Even if you do-do I know?  How can I know in this state of mind? I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND IT HURTS SO BADLY RIGHT NOW. I want this love to have no pain? Is that possible? 














 I hate this state.
Please make the pain go away pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease <GOD>"

"event","So me and Susie broke up once again recently and its been bothering me a lot.  I really love her and want to marry her when I grow up.  Her feelings for me have changed and it really hurts.  She also is kind of interested in this guy Eugene who she thinks is cute and interesting.  It's really upsetting to see her or think of her with another guy.  They went to the movies and she put her head on his chest and he his arm around her.  I also think that tonight that she lied to me for the second night in a row.  This time she lied to stay on the phone with I presume Eugene although she said it was just her brother Mike.  I caught her because I cam back online and she was online on her myspace and so was he.  I can't believe this.  Maybe I was prying a little bit but it was kinda akward when she got off so quickly saying she was tired and didn't really sound it.  Then she said to the mysterious person, ""I don't know what to do because Charlie just called,"" and she wouldn't say that to Mike if he was just calling to ""tell her to leave the door open.""  I wonder how long it took her to come up with that excuse.  Susie never used to lie to me and my feeling are really hurt but I guess she doesn't seem to care.  And plus she promised me that she would go right to bed tonight and then she goes off and does this.  Thanks for crapping all over my feelings.  This is the girl I love.  Ya you know someone was right when they said they found a fatal flaw in the logic of love.  I see what you mean now.  Somebody has some explaining to do.  I am going to go in a corner now and cry."

"event","Well last Thursday was supposed to be a great night.  I was supposed to go see my favorite band Mudvayne with Susie in the city.  But when we got there Susie wasn't allowed in because she didnt have any ID.  I got very frustrated and acted like a complete ""jerk"" to her.  What makes the story even more annoying is that 5 minutes after we left two kids who also didnt have ID got in when the bouncer left.  Then later that night Susie broke up with me because I had treated her badly all in one day.  I had just had such a good week with her trying to get her back from a recent break up and now this happens.  Why did it happen so soon after.  I would say yah just my luck but it was not coincidence it was all my fault.  Susie if I could I would do anything to take that night back I would believe me.  I feel so bad so resentful and so frustrated that I let a concert get between me and the person I love.  So although the relationship isnt in tact right now I will continue to treat you the way I did the previous week to make it up to you again.  Another annoying thing is that this is happening right after her parents allowed us to go to the same college.  Why'd I screw up so shortly after.  It's like I climbed three steps up the ladder and climbed down four right after.  Life was so good and at the peak of it was this concert but now it's just a valley.  I'm so sorry for hurting the one I love and I hope you feel better and I will do whatever I can do to help that.  I just hope she doesn't hate me and never wants to speak to me again.  I love you and I know this is getting overplayed but I feel it is neccessary because of what I have done   but once again I am sorry.  Please forgive me relax take your time and space and call me when ready."

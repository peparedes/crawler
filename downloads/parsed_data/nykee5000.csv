"event","My head is pounding as if someone's placed a gigantic vice grip around it and is squeezing the life out of it. I can't handle much more depression and anxiety, which consequently makes my head feel like a frisbee twice it's normal size, so I'm going to try counseling. I have to do something. My thoughts are unhealthy and my emotions are like the wooden roller coaster at Magic Mountain: up, down, and bumpy all along the way. On one side I do recognize I'm 7 1/2 mo. pregnant, I've been getting less sleep as my pregnant belly enlarges and my son likes to sit on my pelvis or bladder, thus I must pee about 4 times a night. However, it's time for me to start thinking about me, my daughter, and my unborn son; not what I think is right by other people's standards. I'm holding on by a very thin thread which is sitting over a flame. Lord I can't wait to have this baby, I need a drink!"

I've also had some seriously strong contractions...I just turned 6 months so this baby is in no way ready to come.

Speaking of early I had a dream that I delivered early and during labor I passed out. When I came to my mother handed me a bundle all wrapped up in pink. ""Here's your baby,"" she says. I looked and it was a girl! I said there must have been a mistake because I was having a girl, but she said that the ultrasound was a mistake. I then asked how much the baby weighed and she responded, ""18 lbs."" I flipped then woke up. Weird preggo dreams!"

On a different note. With all the hoopla of my son's father's family we've finally reached some reconciliation. I had a talk with his mother and explained to her about why I broke things off and that what happened was not consentual! She then understood why I'm making the decisions I'm making and can see everything from a woman's point of view. I felt a lot better getting the true story out and soon after I told my parents and pastor. I was done protecting someone that didn't need to be protected and if he isn't going to tell the true story about what happened then I will.

I have a lot of peace within myself now. Finally, I can enjoy this pregnancy and learn to love. This time has been hard, but due to the efforts of family, very close friends, and prayer I'm starting to heal from the things that happened, not only now but from 5 years ago when the majority of my problems started.

"event","One thing I have to say about pregnancy is it has a way of looking at life from a different perspective. To anyone that reads my journal please bear with me, I find the best times to write are when I'm having a hormonal/emotional breakdown. For some stupid reason this journal is a way of healing, through opening up...which I rarely do anymore, (I blow everything off as fine unless I'm upset) and receiving either encouragement or humor. Some of you many think, ""My God get over it woman!"" For you ladies...just you wait...you'll be as crazy as me one day, or worse, crazier! For you men...you're going to have to deal with these yo-yo headed women for 9 months...have fun!

Talking with my mother today I was discussing how I hope that Genesis doesn't have the same trouble making friends in school like I did. My mother proceeds to tell me that I was mean as a child so no one wanted to play with me. I thought about it, but all I could remember was being mean to the girls that were teacher's pets and the snots. I know I was mean to my brother, but he was the golden boy! Jay could do no wrong. He made good grades, he was popular and most of all he was Mom's favorite. She told me she never understood why I changed from a loving kid to a very mean one. I sat there thinking, ""<i>You honestly don't know?</i>"" 

It all stems from I was my grandmother's favorite and I was ""Grandma's girl."" So she said to herself when Jay was born, ""You have my daughter, but you're not getting my son."" (This coming from her mouth) She basically explained that she gave up on me. I remember as a child seeing them together and feeling left out. Mom hardly hugged or played with me. She was buddy buddy with my brother and I hated him for it. I remember being mean to him because it upset my mother. I hated and loathed him because he got the most praise for athleticism even though I worked just as hard. Things were handed to him on a silver spoon, but I had to work for it. I felt that I had been cheated in life...no one should have it that easy. So I hated all the suck ups and snots, the little golden children who couldn't do a damn wrong thing in the teacher's eyes. Don't get me wrong, you didn't cross me when it came to my brother, that was my job. I kicked I don't know how many asses because of it, so I was known as a fighter. I became the leader of the misfits, rejected, dorky, nerdy, outcasts...I hated injustice, I would have my revenge and it would start in my own home! 

I was thinking about our conversation a moment ago and started getting emotional, as I usually do these days. I've determined, I'm not going to put either of my kids in that postion. Make one think I love the other and not them. I don't want to raise someone that feels like the only friends their good enough to have are social outcasts. That's why I love all my children in Georgia. In many ways I felt like I was their mother and I was helping to fill the void in their life. I know I'm going to love my children dearly, I just don't want them to think it has to be a competition. Life isn't a competition, it's a walk. Their are days I want to pack up all my stuff, call up my old job...ask for it back, see if I can live with Shannon and take my kids to Georgia. Ah Georgia, you'll always be my home, the place where I was healed because for once I was better than my brother. I didn't need my mother because I had many. I didn't a brother, because I had them and sisters. I didn't need my father because many took me in as their own.  And for once I was accepted, loved and needed."

What I think is so cool is many of my friends and family surrounded us, even though my parents were too prideful to ask for help. The coolest thing is that someone randomly decided to give us money to use on Christmas only. My mom broke down...she thought it was so amazing that someone would give money.

"event","I'm finding myself living more and more in my fantasies and dreams. I'll catch myself totally spacing out and not realizing it. I thought at first something was wrong with me, but the more I thought on it the clearer the answer became. I hate reality! I fucking...hate...reality! The only reality I enjoy is watching my daughter grow, play, learn, and just be a baby. In my world I can control the events and people...I am master of their fate...no one controls me. The stories, adventures, romances, losses...it's sad, but I feel closer to the figments of my imagination than anyone else in the physical realm. They don't judge me, they don't put me down, they're always there for support, I'm always loved....I'm never broken hearted. I realized it's my way of coping when things are tough in life and I don't know where to turn. 

I remember someone saying that my imagination was unhealthy...even go so far as to say it was ""evil."" So, I set aside my imagination, my stories, MY control of life. It's taken me almost 5 years to regain what I put away. ""Fuck you for saying that something God gave me was an escape and evil! You don't know shit about other people's lives and how they cope with the harshness of it!"" Pardon me...I've kept that inside for far too long now.

I wish I could write down some of the stories I see, yet when thought comes to paper it doesn't come out nearly as well as I would like it. I might try again sometime. However, I have a feeling I'll never finish it, and there's nothing worse than not seeing something to it's completion."

(I think Muj might remember him) As of yet they don't know the cause of death. He didn't let me give up when I wanted to. He encouraged me to keep fighting even when times were tough. 

Larry I'm going to miss you and your wisdom."

"event","Stupid Phantom of the Opera making me cry like a little school girl! I've been a fan of the book since I was about 12, never saw the musical, but heard the sound track. In ways I'm glad that they didn't follow the book too closely because the movie would have lost it's charm. I love this movie because the phantom's pain and anguish are apparent in us all in some small way. Plus I have a tender spot towards those who are tragically hurt or shunned by society. The singing isn't too bad if you can get past that it's a wonderful movie! The one downfall is the ending credits song ""Learn to be Lonely,"" I almost threw a shoe through the TV!!!!

If I could meet one person it would be Gerard Butler, he conveyed the sorrow, torment, tragedy, love, and adoration in such a real and painful way. Thanks Mr. Butler!"

"event","Well the dream has ended and for some reason I'm left bereft. I wish I could explain why, but I really don't even know myself. I am sadden that the dream may never come true, however it's probably for the best. I'll get through this just like every other thing in my life. However it was nice to dream and have that one moment where reality no longer existed for me and I was once again found desirable. 

So long dream, thanks for giving me something to hang onto during this hard time. Visit me again sometime soon."

"event","There would be hope for the world if people acted more like 3 year old Olivia Bollinger.

I came to work one day and saw this ziplock bag full of change. I asked the head teacher why was it in the classroom (there is to be no coins in the classroom, they're a choking hazard). She said, Olivia brought it in and was insistent that she had to give it to Ms. VanHook (me). ""She argued all morning with her mom, but was insistent that she had to bring it because Ms. VanHook needed it."" Instead of continuing to argue with her daughter she let her take the money.

I turned and asked Olivia, ""Why do I need your money?"" ""Because you do,"" she replied."" I again asked her, ""Olivia why do I need your money?"" ""So you can buy toys with it!"" she responded proudly. I smiled at her, gave her a hug and thanked her. Confused I turned back to Ms. Kletsch, suddenly the lightbulb came on. I said to the teacher, ""I know what she's talking about! Arianna (another student) asked me about a toy and why I didn't have it and I told her, 'Because I don't have any money.'"" 

I learned a valuable lesson that day, all from a 3 year old girl named Olivia."

"event","Just like the subject says....I got into a wreck Monday night. Thank God Genesis wasn't in the car with me. The jist of it is I was stopped at a stop sign and saw this lady with her blinker on, plus a long line of traffic trailing behind her. It looked like she was going to turn down the street I was at, so I pulled out to avoid the traffic. I assumed wrong! She plowed my back driver's side panel and spun my car around (180). She gets out of her car and repeatedly asks me, ""Honey, why did you pull out in front of me?"" At that moment all I could think about was insurance and, ""How am I going to get to work?"" I called my mom and she said they were on their way and then I called Nathan who said the same. The officer came to my car and asked me to pull into this building complex. He takes one look at me and says, ""Did you hit your head?"" I nodded. ""I'm calling an ambulance."" I then argued with this cop for the next 15 mins that I didn't need an ambulance, I was fine and I couldn't afford it. At one time I get out of my car to talk to him and he yells at me to get back into my car before I drop. The ambulance arrives and I told them that I didn't need a ride. They proceed to ask me a series of questions, look at each other in confusion and ask me, ""Why did the officer call for an ambulance if you didn't need one?"" It still remains a mystery. So as I'm signing a waiver saying that I declined ambulance assistance when my parents roll up. First thing out of my mom's mouth, ""You do know we're getting kicked off our insurance now?"" I gruffly said, ""I know mom and I don't need this now."" She turns on her heel and marchs back to the Suburban and her and dad leave. THEY LEAVE ME THERE! At this time I found out that my car isn't drivable and has to be towed. Thank God Nathan pulls up then. Still, I have to calm him down because he's all distraught. So, the EMT's leave, yet I still have to deal with this cop and crazy woman. The officer gives me back my information and starts to give me back my citation when the woman comes up to me and says in her gravely voice, ""Honey I don't want to get you into trouble."" ""I got myself into trouble,"" I responded. ""Well, I want to leave you my number if there's anything I can do. I just don't want to see you in trouble. I'm from the South and I feel just terrible about all this."" The whole time the officer is trying to shoo her away like a pesky fly. She gave me a hug and left. I got my citation for failure to yield at a stop sign, which he told me to take it to court and plead No Contest. Nathan took me home and I balled the whole way home and all I could say was, ""I can't believe they left me. I can't believe they left me."" So I talked to my parents and got things worked out, I'm still upset with them, but I'll get over it. 

So there you have it! I owe just under $1000.00 in my damages alone, plus all my medical bills are coming out of my own pocket (Liability sucks). I can't work for the rest of this week because the dr. doesn't want me to mess anything else up. It's an adventure, however everything will work out in the end."

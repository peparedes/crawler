"event","My god, i cant believe that i am at work again.

I have had a good few days though so i cant really complain much, sunday went to cats dads gig thing, that was cool, and last night/this morning was the 6th form ball from my old school, lots of alcohol, yay.

Had a big hangover this morning, never a good thing when your with your girlfriend, but went to the pub at lunch and drunk some more alcohol to try and make me feel better, it got rid of my headache, well until leigh knocked a light fitting on to my head later on in the day :(

But im at work now very bored, havent been home since 3 o'clock on sunday.

Well thats another boring update of my life, lol"

I have no idea what to type about so im just going to talk about nothing (nothing new there then)

My typing is shit tonite, i have had to change so much because i cant type, but hopefully it is all correct now

im am extremely bored because i am sat at work on my own wiv noone to talk to :(, hence why i am doing this, i wish i could be with cat rite now, im soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bored, lol

Anyway thats it, rather boring and not as short as i thought it would be but nevermind, hope you had fun reading it"

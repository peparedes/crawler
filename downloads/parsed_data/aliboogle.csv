In between doing work Alan has been teaching me how to dive so have been getting fit swimming and diving. Went four times last week, doing about an hour and a half each session. Its good fun. Went horse riding on sunday aswell which was a laugh. we both did really well .. we had no choice but to really because we told the teacher that we could canter - haha! we went horse riding because we decided to go on holiday into the lake district on a horse riding holiday for valentines day. My back has been aching since sunday ... still looking forward to next sunday though. 
Counselling is going well. I feel like i am over the worst of it now. with a load of help from Alan. 
Havnt really been going out at alll .... havnt really been in the mood for it to be honest. I feel like i have changed a lot along with my priorities, like my uni work is so much more important to me now then it was before.

Me and Alan have becomre really good mates and he lives near us at home .. so we share the driving when we come home. We also have shared singing lessons (well we've had 1 so far, but it was such a giggle) It's nice to have a guy to sing Phantom of the Opera pieces with though. 
I have started counselling sessions ... for those of you who knew what went on ! So hoping to have a clearer head from it all in about 4 months which would be good as things are getting harder to cope with.
Saw Nathan last friday when we were both out clubbing - he said he still cared which was nice to hear. Hopefully me and him will be better mates soon cos the only times we have seen each other are when we are in the same club. 
Been getting very drunk :) I've been almost carried home on lots of occasions ... ha ha- lots of funny drunken stories.
I have had my hair cut off ! ... well not really but its very short and the underneath is bright pink - well was Alan needs to dye it for me again.

There will be people whom i will miss but will be loads of fun meeting new people and always having a shoulder to cry on just round the corner will be useful because i was in tears here but still do not feel comfortable enough to use anyone as a shoulder esp. seems clare is away. damo said he would call me son though.

Me and Matt have been mates for about a year ... i go to uni and don't see him for the whole time that i am there ..... i come back ... we meet up and get along really well so end up spending nearly every day together, which involved me phoning him to organise stuff every day .... we get horny (wine si bad for me .. lol) have sex once ..... from then on i make it clear i am not interested - he tells me that he understands fully .... we cuddle when we meet after then ... i decide i need some time on my own (as u do some days) so decide not to see him for a few days .... during these days we still spoke over text and msn! .... after 3 days he comes on msn and says to me ""i though u had moved on to the next cock!"" ... i get angry and upset obvioously because he is calling me a whore! ... he starts laying in to me saying he thinks i am very low and how he had to make the effort during the past 3 days to talk to me .... he ends the convo by sayin he expects abuse over myspace knowing full well that my ex did exactly that and how upset and angry i got over it! 

so what happened? because to be honest im not sure! and who gives this much abuse to a mate 5 weeks after going thro the hardest time of my life!??

isn't life so fucking perfect!? and that's not even sracasm. i'm agreeing with Devro's last post - life is good. I mean, i'm still young and at uni and stuff! I have wicked mates ... love you all!

So  my party at Max's house was ... eventful - i am sorry to those who i did'nt speak to, i mean you could have joined me for a philosophical chat whilst i had my head down the toilet if you wwanted to?? ... nope! .. thought not! But thankyou sooo much to those who came in and keptme company (the people i remember are Matt, Clare and Devro .. oh and occasionally Danny) Sorry if there were other people whom i have left out. I really appreciated it, like truly - seriously meant a lot. And no Matt it was not your fault in one tiny little way!

Whilst i had the house to  myself, i had a mate over from uni ... Damian. Bless him, he's been like a rock for me at uni through the shit. I'm glad i have been able to help him aswell! Many many more wicked times next year too - i promise! He is one of a few people who i can truely relax around, another person being Clare!

Me and Matt hung out alot too - i really appreciated the company. Was really wierd seeing him after a year ... but good. He hasn't changed much at all! I don't want him too either.

Me and Clare are really good mates again ... i know i mention this in most of my entries - but thats because she means the world to me.

Me and Rich have split up, which was my decision because i realised how immature and annoying he was. After having a great weekend with Nathan at Download festival i realised that i missed him and want him back. I told him how i feel but at the moment he wants to stay with his new girlfriend. To me she seems so bad for him, i mean his grades were A's when i was with him but now the year is over and he still hasnt handed work in. She has failed her first yearof uni by not handing work in. Maybe he'll realise. I don't mean to sound like i'm being bitchy cos i want him back i would be happier if he realised and still didnt get with me. So at the moment love life sucks.
For the past month i have been facing such a hard decision, and towards the end i had to rush to make up my mind. I now regret the decision i made and feel so empty and hollow, and i just want what i had back and i feel so selfish to have done what i did. OK, i realise this only makes sense to people i have already talked to but i cant exactly spell it out cos i dont know exactly who reads it. 
Passed my first year of uni, didnt do as well as i hoped but i had a hard time during my exams and it was those that bought it down. So ended up with a 2:2. Will try harder next year. 
i'm really happy knowing that me and clare are good mates again. it really upset me when we werent. 
Going to start looking for a job next week, probs just pop in a temping agency. I have to wait a while to work as have been told by doctors no strenous acticity for 2 weeks, so i guess working after 1 will be ok, lol.

It felt as though my world had crumbled - although i should have seen it coming because the Tarot card reader i went to see about half a year a go told me this was going to happen. I feel like i can start really seeing what uni is about .... making good friends. I have been going out loads more in the past 2 weeks and made new and really good friends. So hopefully everything is on the way up now. although it bugs me how often he gets in contact while i am out .... why do i care where he is or what he's doing?
At the mo i cant look at him without feeling hate inside cos these past 2 weeks all he has done is pis me off. He had a go at me saying i dont do anything around the flat! I do loads! :(  At least now i know that he doesnt really appreciate me ... its funny to see the cracks appear when u split up - or should i say huge gaps.
I am on top of uni work at the mo. only 1 more essay due in before easter and i will def be able to cope with that. I found out my exam dates they are ... 10th, 17th and 19th. which isnt too bad. 
I am looking forward to coming home for Easter - for 3 weeks! I am just a bit sad that i cant go and stay with Clare and Devro because i cant fit it in.
I am still torn about Download festival - i feel really ashamed having to ask Mum for money and i have barely enough now to live off til easter. 
I am so insanely bored at the moment. I got in at about 1.30 and nathan was still in bed so i wasnt allowed the light on and my music had to be quiet. cant wait til next yr when i have my own room and my own space.

Obviously we still have to live together until next year and it's killing me to see him and not be able to hug or kiss him but i know i have to stay strong because in the end everything will be OK. It's been ages since i was single so it all feels a little wierd. To be honest it still feels like i am with him. Maybe during the summer when i see him less then it will hit me exactly what has happened. He's taking my engagement ring of today.

Another reason is because i need my own space. Lately i've been thinking how much i rely upon him and i dont want to. I want to live life properly and stand on my own two feet instead of relying upon him for everything. And so i thought if i lived on my own then it would give me a chance to. 
Also, he doesnt go out with his friends and so when i do go out i feel guilty because he is at home on his own. and i feel i have to invite him out everywhere when i just want to spend some time with my friends alone. 
So yeah, me  and Nathan are living seperately next year .. then i dont know what will happen. but whatever does happen i explained to him i'll always be his best friend. 
It's made me sad and down that i'll e living without him but i feel that it's something i have to do. 
Also, something else happened which i cant really post here."

"event","Everything is going amazingly well (except how much work i have to do ... which is rock hard!!)
For once i might actually be nearly happy being at uni. I have been much more confident since friday night when everyone seemed to be complimenting me - i had loads of guys round me ... it made me happy, not that i fancied any of them but the attention was nice. Especially one guy who was pretty much attatched to me for the whole of the night. This is all whilst Nathan is on the dance floor. It's nice that he trusts me even when there are guys talking to me - he just pops over now and then to see if i am ok. Other than that he left me to do what i wanted. I think my confidence dropped mainly because the water here is sooo dirty (u wash your hands and they fell slimey and greasy) and it is making me spotty ... but i am getting over it now and next year i'll have decent water so sould be better. 
I'm hopefully having a karaoke party during easter (nothings confirmed yet) with alcohol so people will relax and have a go. Helen (my little sister) said she would stay downstairs with us this time so hopefully she will join in - she has such an amazing voice! Hopefully i can pick up the courage to actually sing properly at this karaoke .. i have been given loads of advice and techniques to make my voice sound powerful so i can see if the work.
Going to a party tonight ... probably without Nathan, not sure yet he has loads of work to do. 
I dont know if i have posted this already but i have myspace .... the address is www.myspace.com/random_stuff Have a look and tell me what you think. I am pretty impressed with it. Gives me something to do aswell when i am bored.
Well better have another look at my 1/4 done essay see if i can do anymore ... seems as it is in by friday - cos i want to go home over the weekend. Oh and so far my essay results have been .... 55%, 65% and 35% (which i have just re-done and needs handing in friday too!). 
See you all soon. Looking forward to easter when we can hang out together again .... bye bye xxx"

"event","Everything lately is going well. Valentine's day was good, i got a bunch of flowers and we are going to Chester Zoo on friday (i am so excited! - i know it's sad). Went down the gym again this week, i understand why Jo likes it, it's sort of addictive and it makes you feel really good. Although this time nathan dared me to see how many weights i could go up to so now my legs are seriously hurting. Hopefully going again this week. Although i havnt seemed to lost much weight i still feel better about myself. the chat i had with Devro helped too. I am looking forward to easter loads ... Epica and i get to stay with Clare although i dont know for how long yet.

"event","I am playing internet checker at the moment ... how cool am i?
Just got back from my singing lesson - it went ok, still not happy with a few pieces although my teacher thinks they are fine and all i need to do is get some confidence, how do i do that?. Also have quite a dilemna! My teacher has offered me to do my grade 4 exam before summer. Now it may seem perfect and i REALLY want to do it then but it means travelling all the way to Huddersfield just to do it. Plus even more complications .... i get kicked out of here on the 1st july and cant move in to my new house til 3rd (plus i can live at my new house cause its having a new bathroom being put in!) So the only way i can do it is if Louise doesnt move, which at the moment is looking like she may not. Argh! So do i take a risk and do it, hopefully pass then study for grade 5 and do that at christmas, therefore doing 2 grades in 1 yr or be safe and just not do it. What do you think? thats even if u r following my thoughts ... i've probs gone off on one.

So I decided to check out their website few days ago when i realised they were touring and coming to London for one day. I went to buy tickets but they werent on sale. Just checked again and they were so me and Nathan have got our tickets! Hopefully more people will come though. Should be a good night. Very happy now."

I have about 4 essays to do at the moment ... havnt started any of them but will do tomorrow. 
I havnt been out at all lately drinking either. Everyone seems to be so busy. Already planned to go out next week though. 
Oh and i got a B in an essay.. Woohoo. So i am pleased about that. Although i did fail another by 5 marks ... what is it about 5 marks???? ... failed singing by 5 marks, missed grade A in my essay by 5 marks! I am not liking the number 5 lately.

"event","I had to do a presentation today, which i absolutely hate but it went ok. After he told me the teacher couldnt hear me properly but he said that my points were good and i should expand on them. So that was going ok. Then i went to go and get my first essay result - i only got 55 so i feel like shit. i thought i could do better but obviously not. i know its over the 40 you need to pass but only just i was hoping for at least 60 and so when all my friends were bragging they they got about 65 it made me feel worse. The next lecture we were meant to get another essay result but i just couldnt face it and i was almost crying from the first so i went back to the flat. I have also put on loads of weight being with Nathan (not sure of thats good or bad) and thats getting to me too. so at the moment its salad for dinner and gym every 2 days.I feel more self conscious here,at uni, then i ever have done in the past. I'm hoping i get better results but i really doubt it. Anyways. going to my sisters house this weekend and back home next weekend. i have signed a contract for a house next year - its onlt 3 minute walk from the uni an its quite big. See everyone soon."

"event","Last night we went to Leeds drinking with some of my mates who we are moving in with next year. It was a good laught. We started of going in a place called Flares (70's disco place) it was full of really old people dancing really badly. We drank a bit in there. Oh and some of the men in there looked like serial rapist - it was very scary. We left and went to a beach bar thing - which i thought was shit. It was again full of  old people, no good music. but they did have a rotating dancefloor (not that i went on it). The amount i drank i should have been really drunk but i was only tipsy throughout the night.

By the way i have been blocked out of my sim, so for the moment my number is 07746416627.

Not looking forward to having to write a 2000 word essay over the weekend, or doing my clothes washing."

"event","Today i have been looking at houses to live in next year. We all visited two - the first one was gorgous but the second was way too big. The three other people i will be living with (ignoring nathan) are great, well apart from one who is a little special if you get what i mean. I can see her annoying me but she wasnt my choice of housemate and so i have to put up with it. I am just glad i do not have to live in uni accomodation next year - which was what nathan wanted at first.

I have my first singing lesson with my new tutor on thursday - i am really looking forward to it for some reason. Still a bit annoyed i failed but hey nothing i can do now ... and it was by only 5 marks! Grade 4 next!

It is wierd being back at uni - i had settled in back home too much. I dont like all this moving around. If only i wasnt so far away from home i would probably feel more comfortable. 

Got another essay to write tomorrow - yay! Always fun.

i can not believe that i only have a week left here at home before i go back to uni. i am really not looking forward to going back - i have settled in here again, plus i do not enjoy it loads at uni. i mean its not bad but its not great or how i expected it at all. 

i am hoping that the karaoke night or a different sprt of gathering thing is organised so i can meet up with everyone again before going back to uni.

"event","I didnt mean to be rude or to offend anyone when i left the restaraunt early, but i feel i have. i just felt like (well i know that) no one was talking to me at all. no one really said hello to me at the beginning except Clare but when we were round the table even she didnt talk to me, all she said was ""im glad we are friends"" then turned away and didnt speak to me again. it reminded me of everything i hated about sixth form - not feeling like i even fit in the group or if you really wanted me there. is it because i am with Nathan and so you find it hard to talk to me? I speak to people on msn who when i see them make me feel like they are only chatting to me cos they are bored and not cos they really want to. So that is why i left early .. to be honest i wanted to leave when we were walking there cos none of you even realised me and Nathan were walking really far back, cos you never stopped for us.

It might sound like i am still depressed about it, but i am not ... it happened few days ago so i have dealt with it. i just wanted to explain why i left.

"event","I think i have been ill mainly because me and Nathan have been arguing since being at university. Every day we have an argument, even if its a petty little argument it still gets me down. It has been getting worse lately though. We had a huge row over a girl who he was chatting to at the bar but kept acting like he was hiding something ... but i think we have sorted out (if u class just ignoring it for the sake of getting along sorting it out). I am hoping that everything will calm down over christmas - I am just blaming it on us being stressed and under pressure with lots of work. I'm sure everything will be OK. We do have our good times too but it is hard because he has only been in to town drinking once since being here without me and so it makes me feel bad because i go out quiet a bit. He knows all this but nothing seems to come of it when we talk about it. but i feel like i have no space ... although when our band starts up at least i can escape the room to jam with them. 

I cant wait til christmas to see everyone again, i am going to try my hardest to come to most of the gatherings even though i have no money and am into my overdraft :(

I like this site - i get to blab on about stuff thats worying me.

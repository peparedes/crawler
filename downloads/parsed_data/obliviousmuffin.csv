"event","Havn't updated this thing in a while. That's too bad. I've been soo busy doing absolutely nothing that i cant even update a flippin journal. Ive been able to sleep alot lately... because i have only had two finals this week. Rad?

Lavender incense makes me drowsy... i dig it.

The school is empty and quiet without the Seniors. Much to ominous for my blood.

Im actually writing this in computers because im so scandelous.

We're actually just sitting around, talking, playing chess and watching world cup highlights... so no worries. 

I've actually been in a better mood than i have been for a while. My spirits are high and I'm completely high on life... It feels...



Wonderful.

I'm excited to get long-distance running in the summer again. Im hoping to boost my mileage by two miles. 

Here we go..."

"event","A half in half day.

I think im supersticious...
If I take a shower in the morning and use a blue towel and a red bath mat, my days are half really good and half really w/e. If i use a blue towel and a blue bath mat, then i either have a fully good day or a fully terrible day. 

wierd huh?
I thought so.

Also if i take my vitemens with water instead of OJ i end up having a stressful day. 


The seniors are no longer... 
='(
I do not even want to think of the day when my class becomes seniors.

That will just go back to square one.
Hell.

My poetry book... is major lusty.

I must do Bio notecards.

Soccer signups were today. It was nice to see Jorge and talk to him. What an awesome coach. I hope i feel that way during Varsity practices.

Good bye beloved seniors.
You will be missed.
Dearly.
Utterly.
Sincerly.

"event","Yes. Today I got my math final back. 93%! YESSSSSSSAHHHHHHHHHH! Im very pleased. I thought I had failed considering the fact that I didnt not study very much. 

Life is grand. 

Gramcracker. 

Well... I am anxious to work on my history final project and get that out of the way so I can just focus on finals and whatnot. 
Ugh.. more finals...

"event","Ok. <br /><br />Currently I am eating granola with vanilla yogurt for lunch... <br />Vanilla incense is burning strong. <br />My chapstick smells like cake frosting. <br /><br />Today was the last spring soccer game of the season. My emotions were all over the place today. <br /><br />This morning i woke up at 9... ""OH NO! I have to leave in 40 minutes!!"" <br />I raced into the shower to wake myself up. I noticed that my towel and my bath mat were blue... Oh and i had a dream last night that i went to an icecream store with Rachel and Emily, and i got blackberry =)... the icecream was like the size of my head and i got it in a little cone. Rachel called me a fat person, i dropped it, then woke up. <br /><br />Oh, back to the not-so interesting story. <br />So i get out of the shower and ran up to my room and started playing happy, motivational music to keep my spirits high. I ate my special K, got ready and went out the door. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />At the field Jordi got me all upset, so i was a bum for the warm up practice. During the game I played goal the first half. It was ok. I let one get by me. Neka. gah. I played field for the rest of the game. A girl shoved me and got called for it. She got all pissed and yelled at the ref and got a RED CARD! =o From the sidelines she yelled awful things to Whitney and I, but we just sort of ignored her awfulness. <br /><br />At the end of the game we lost. But we had an ok time doing it =) <br /><br />My mum took me to Juice Guys for a smoothie =D. <br /><br />I lust my team. I heart soccer. <br /><br />I am getting a pimple on my chin... i think =\... pimples are very noticeable on me. <br /><br />hah. Katelyn has to clean Sam Toole's feet for Iron Man after he swims. <br />HAH!<br /><br /><br /><center><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/obliviousmuffin/pic/00010cgh/""><img height=""137"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/obliviousmuffin/pic/00010cgh/s320x240"" /></a><br />I have rainbows in my eyes.<br /></center><br /><br />"

"event","Today I woke up feeling Languorous, pensive... I tried to remember the dream I had last night... It was 11 o'clock AM. 

Today I sang ""Wish you were Here,"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" in the shower. I wrote my name in green gell shaving cream on the wall... 

Today I had brunch with my father. It was pleasant. We bantered on about nothing... my faveroite subject =). He went with me to the library and helped me find books on Greece for my History Final Project exam. We sang along to Buffalo Soldier in the car loud and obnoxiously. 

Today I took notes on the modern history of Greece and drank orange juice. I was interested.

My father became enraged when mom asked him to go supermarket shopping... i forgot to tell him, so it was my fault. He honked his horn at two horse back riders on Milbrook. They threw swears and threats at one another as i barried my head in my hands. He yelled at me in the supermarket, but I kept quiet. He got reported to the police. He is speaking to them right now.



Tonight I will go to the soccer dinner. Tonight i will escape.

Back from team dinner. Our team is so awkward... so many tensions... i barely talked. I stared at the wall. I didnt make conversation. I was totally, and utterly irrevocable. A few people wern't there that usually make the team a single unit of friendliness... without those people there was a void. 
*silence*

--> My cat posing as a Ying Yang. 

It was undeniably clear to me i don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew what worthless dregs we've always been.

Lucked out and found my favorite records
Lying in wait at the birmingham mall.
The songs that i heard,
The occasional book
Were the only fun i ever took.
And i got on with making myself.
The trick is just making yourself.

But when they're parking their cars on your chest
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body
Caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight...

_ Know your Onion; The Shins


My day was better than the last few. 
This pleases me.

Yahh Today was not so good... Deffinetly could have been much better... I hope =\

This week really isnt being too nice... 
I believe that I failed my math final...
I believe that I need something good to happen in order to make it better... 
Summer will come about...

I wrote an antagonistic poem today about my english teacher... when I finished i noticed that i wrote it for no apparent reason... I was just pissed off at myself, though i thought i was mad at my english teacher for whatever reason... 

I am so confused...

This math Midterm has lasted for two whole days including lunch hours, after school, and ya...

Academic awards were today and I got two in classes where I just ask questions obnoxiously all the time... but hey cool =)

Mr. Stetson had a heart-attack, so it will always be a free period in computers...
=)/=(

Soccer was peachy today =) Goalie really doesnt appeal to me anymore, Id much rather play a field position these days...

Adele: What ryhmes with Beaumont?

---> These were pictures that i took outside today... I noticed that the flowers had cross polinated to produce a seed that would bloom into a gorgeous mix of the two lusty flowers... I'm in love.

Today was not special. Math finals, Biology quizes, etc...

Soccer coaching went well... we won our game...woohoo?

Soccer practice was uninteresting...

River today poked fun at the way I used to run, and the fact that I had knocked Chris's teeth out during a floor hockey game in 2nd grade... Thanx Riv...

I was a troubled child... 
Wait.. I'm STILL a troubled child...

But everything I ever did was an accident... 
Well, infact, I was an accident... 
My mother was too old to give birth at the time...
But im not sure if that's accidental, or im just speaking non-sense


What else is new?

Maybe that mixed panzie and I are both accidents... or maybe...

Today during writing seminar we went for a walk from the school to town...
The weather was immpeccable
The air was clear...

Oh how I wish I could remain outside for the rest of the day...
Sadly that was not the case...

I wonder if anyone has ever frozen a peep.

I'm beginning to frighten myself...
I had a dream last night that I failed a test, and I cried... 
Why am I so consumed? Why am I so uptight when it comes to scholastics? Why do I feel the need to study in my spare time? on this sunny monday? I'm supposed to be an ego, but sadly I am still at the ""ID"" level... My parents expectations overpower my thought

I have to get over this shit...

Today I will go to soccer practice. Today I will be with friends.

I am flossing my teeth with two flossers...
I feel sick...

If floss was banana flavored that would be kind of nasty...

--> this is a picture that i took of my beautiful guitar blondie... though i made alot of alterations...

She has string rot... its gross... I dont like it... 
It must be this heat and humidity we're experiencing...
I need new 9 and 11 gage gibson strings...



One time Mr. Laredo told me that stress is healthy...
If its healthy, then why does it make me feel so gross?
I guess its a kind of ""cough syrup"" 
Its nasty tasting... but its supposed to be good for you...

Ahh yes, a new live journal. A clean slate, a new beginning, a blank canvas... 

Some believe live journal is overrated... 
I don't care...

In my journal i can write as i please, even if it lacks a point. 

None shall peanalize me.
None shall stifle my freedom to rant!

Its a beautiful day,
And dont have a slip and slide... 

The sun is up
I'm so happy I could scream!
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you
It's perfect
It's all I ever wanted
I almost can't believe that it's for real

I really don't think it gets any better than this
Vanilla smile
And a gorgeous strawberry kiss!
Birds sing we swing
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished

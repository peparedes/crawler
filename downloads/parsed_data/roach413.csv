"event","You are still a whisper on my lips
A feeling at my fingertips
That's pulling at my skin

You leave me when I'm at my worst
Like a feeling as if I've been cursed
From the bitter cold within

Days go by
And still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you
Without you"

"event","it's 5:21 and i havent gotten any sleep.... again. i wish it were as easy as just giving you up and callin it quits and sure ive tried but nothing seems to draw me away from you. i wish things could go back to the way they were before we messed things up. i thought everything was gonna be alright eventually after that dreadful night that im still stuck on and still dwelling on. you say you love me but think about it...if you loved me dont you think that you would want me back just as bad...and it makes me wonder whether you ever really did love me...i guess ill never know. if i could go back i would destroy all our memories together just so we could start fresh and i could have you back in my arms. but now ive realized none of this is what you want... i wish you could have found happiness while still being with me...i just dont see how thats not possible if you were ""so happy"" with me for a while. i guess you see things differently though and it hurts so bad .... so never again will i love anyone the way i love you....i just wish you could give it one more chance and i know it would end eventually again but i think it would be better this time because we know what not to do and ill be more ready for the end next time if youd just give me one more chance...i think you could find happiness... more happiness... with me. im sick of crying everynight, im sick of losing sleep over you, im sick of not eating certain days when i think of you, im sick of ""just being friends"", im sick of being sick, but most of all, im getting sick of loving you! it causes nothing but pain right now. so i beg you from the bottom of my broken heart: please give me one more chance and ill do whatever it takes to make you happier than ever! and after a while if you feel your not as happy as youd like to be then ill drop it and we'll ""just be friends""....and ill be ok with that...so please... think about it."

The opening battle was great.

Baltar really does seem to embrace whatever new role he gets thrust into, doesn't he?  And the Six in Baltar's head is wearing a proper outfit now.

Lee looks to be going into the government.  I look forward to seeing where that goes.

My idea that Starbuck would be inside Lee's head has turned out to be wrong.  No clear answer on whether or not she's a cylon.  It's certainly a nice update to the ""angel"" stuff from the original series.

The four secret cylons seem pretty bewildered at present.  I'm wondering where that's going.

The previews for next week seem to be showing some sort of cylon conflict.

"event","I found out recently that there's a group that somehow keeps track of descendants of Confucius.

The organization has been around since 1930, and there are two million people they've certified as  descendants.  They estimate that there are as many as three million descendants.

Confucius was born in 551 BC and died in 479 BC.  How on Earth are they substantiating this?  According to <b><u><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius"">wikipedia</a></b></u>, the Chinese have been keeping track of (and often honoring) his descendants continually until around 1935.

Imagine if somebody in the West could say the same thing.  

""Yeah, I'm descended from Socrates.""

""Really?  I'm descended from Alexander the Great.""

It does present an interesting question.  If you could pick a historical figure you could legitimately claim descent from, who would that be?

Personally, I'd pick Benjamin Franklin.  He is far and away my favorite Founding Father.

So I've been wondering what I'd do with $40 billion.

More importantly I've been asking all my friends what they'd do with $40 billion.

Now I'm asking you.

What would you do with $40 billion?

So post your answers here, and feel free to get everybody on your friends list to answer the same question.
<lj-cut text=""Some of my friends' answers behind the cut."">
Spike-X said that he'd give money to his kids and the mother of his child.  Also, he'd spend money on healthcare for the aborigines in Australia.

Cosmic Cat said she'd travel.

Mike Smash said he'd set up his own political party and work to bring single payer universal healthcare to the United States.

Stony says he'd work to build up New Zealand in the domain of science and technology.  Not sure what steps he'd take, but $40 billion would certainly give him options.

Personally, I would build a space elevator (I'd probably buy Liftport to do it).

I'd set up a working space elevator, and use that to seed orbit with solar power collecting satellites.  I'd use those satellites to beam cheap energy to the surface.  I'd make a mint, and it would be of tremendous benefit to society.

There would be other projects.  I'd work to use the space elevator to dispose of nuclear waste by taking it up into orbit and launching it towards the Sun.  I'd work on building low-G manufacturing stations.  Orbital tourism.  That sorta thing.

And I'd name my space elevator the Beanstalk.

Off the top of my head, I think <b><u><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0890055/"">Indira Varma</a></b></u> would be a fun choice.

I loved her as Niobe on HBO's Rome."

"event","It took 12 years to do it (and $2.7 billion), but the horse genome has been mapped.

It's only a start, of course.  There's still more to learn and all.  But it's certainly a milestone.

Science is awesome.

"event","Here are three of my favorite quotes:

""I don't think there's a single problem facing this planet that can't be solved. I think some of them, the solutions, already exist. The problem is implementing the solutions.""
Robert Anton Wilson

""We're the species that goes beyond our limitations, and so expanding our horizons with our tools is really what human civilization is all about.""
Ray Kurzweil

""And I think this is a great example of the fact that life rewards people who move in the direction of greatest courage.""
<lj user=tacit>

Honestly, I should include a more complete version of the Robert Anton Wilson quote, too:

""I don't think there's a single problem facing this planet that can't be solved. I think some of them, the solutions, already exist. The problem is implementing the solutions.  Getting the power elite to recognize that this is in their own best interest, too.  To allow some changes to occur.""

I bumped into William Katt on the last day of Dragon*Con.

I think he looks a bit like David Bowie as Tesla (from the movie ""The Prestige"")."

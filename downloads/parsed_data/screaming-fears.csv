"event","this day has just been too bad. paige and krystal were up each other's asses, therefore being total bitches to me. i don't give a fuck if they did share a room this weekend and ""bond"", they are not going to be bitches to me! since the graduation exam is this week, we stayed in the lunchroom and watched lord of the rings. <3

i talked to cameron at break. he fucked whitney garner this weekend, and she has a boyfriend. ;x

kayla and meagan pissed me off BAD at lunch. they were saying i was a whore [ and not joking! ] because i gave cody head and jacked chris off in the movies. no, not a whore, just not some frozen prude ass bitch. thanks. ;] it pisses me off because meagan has done just as much as i have! grr... girls are so fuckin' stupid.

coach beaty pissed me off badly today. we had an hour and 45 minute practice, and we never once practiced. we ran the whole time. no lie. and to add on to that... it was like 70 degrees, and we had to wear sleeves. ugh, he's such a dumbass.

ugh, i gained a pound this week. eh, oh well, i'm losing major next. ;]

so, i talked to chris. he basically told me that i was a waste of his time, that i wasn't worth the next two months he'll be here...oh! but he's doing it for my happiness. whatever, bitch! fuck you. ;D

i have another date with james. maybe this time he'll follow through. we may have two dates. he may come over friday and watch some movies, and saturday... more than likely... i'm going to his baseball game, he's coming home with me, and we're going to the battle of the bands.

you know... i barely even cried over chris. i cried for like maybe 5 minutes when he told me i wasn't worth the next two months... that the only time i cried, but fuck him... he's not worth it. ;D"

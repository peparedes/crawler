"event","I'm taking a break from my essay so it's song lyric time. Ashie sent me this song the other night and I heart it. I can't stop listening to it.

Ever the Same - Rob Thomas 

We were drawn from the weeds 
We were brave like soldiers 
Falling down under the pale moonlight 
You were holding to me 
Like someone broken 
And I couldn't tell you but I'm telling you now 

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart 
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down 

Fall on me 
Tell me everything you want me to be 
Forever with you, forever in me 
Ever the same 

We would stand in the wind 
We were free like water 
Flowing down 
Under the warmth of the sun 
Now it's cold and we're scared 
And we've both been shaken 
Look at us 
This doesn't need to be the end 

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart 
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down 

Fall on me 
Tell me everything you want me to be 
Forever with you 
Forever in me 
Ever the same 
Call on me 
I'll be there for you and you'll be there for me 
Forever it's you 
Forever in me 
Ever the same 

You may need me there 
To carry all your weight 
But you're no burden I assure 
You tide me over 
With a warmth I'll not forget 
But I can only give you love 

Fall on me 
Tell me everything you want me to be 
Forever with you 
Forever in me 
Ever the same 
Call on me 
I'll be there for you and you'll be there for me 
Forever it's you 
Forever in me 
Ever the same 

And I know Karen already posted these lyrics, but I love this song. 
Someday you will be loved - Death Cab for Cutie

I once knew a girl
In the years of my youth
With eyes like the summer
All beauty and truth
In the morning I fled
Left a note and it read
Someday you will be loved.

I cannot pretend that I felt any regret
Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
As the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

You'll be loved you'll be loved
Like you never have known
The memories of me
Will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs
Like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved

You may feel alone when you're falling asleep
And everytime tears roll down your cheeks
But I know your heart belongs to someone you've yet to meet
Someday you will be loved

You'll be loved you'll be loved
Like you never have known
The memories of me
Will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs
Like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved

You'll be loved you'll be loved
Like you never have known
The memories of me
Will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs
Like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved
Someday you will be loved




P.S. I'm making my journal friends only from now on. 
P.S.S. Happy (early) birthday Karen!!"

I have to admit I had pretty low expectations for this one, mainly because it's only a two and a half hour movie and I thought they would cut way too much out of the book. But alas, they wrapped up the plot really nicely without cutting anything major out, the visual effects were breathtaking, it was by far the funniest one yet, and best of all we got the Malfoy/Ferret scene!! YAY!!!

So yeah, go see it!! And for people who haven't read the books yet, READ THE BOOKS ALREADY!! (Ashie I'm looking at you).

Oh yeah and apparently Ashie and I have pretty eyes (we got hit on by some drunk people while walking to the bus terminal). It was a new and slightly frightening experience I must say."

~Pam's yammering on about bacteria and her silly rule about not putting feet at the head of her bed~
Pam: There's so much bacteria, it's so gross.
Dan: Pam, how do you think they make beer? With yeast. 
Pam: So? Girls get yeast infections, it's not the same thing.
Dan & A: ...

~At Coned soccer, Dan kicks the ball in the wrong direction~
Dan: OH, SH... ugar. 

Pam: Did you know that Pam spelled backwards is map? I'm a map yo!!
Dan: Yeah, a map to nowhere. 


Haha, coned today was hilarious. Dan asked me 'can you imagine Pam gutting a fish?' and I think I probably laughed for two minutes straight. Then I think we just made fun of Pam for like ten minutes. Sorry Pam, you know I love you :P

Yesterday my rents and my brother came up to go out for my Dad's birthday which was fun. My dad asked me if I'd like to go to Ireland with him next summer, which I'm really excited about, although it's not etched in stone yet. My mom and I said that if we're going to Ireland then we have to go to England and Scotland too, to which my dad responded with a speech about how the English oppressed the Irish for hundreds of years etc. So we told my dad that he can stay in Ireland while we go see London. It would be so cool if it actually happens, I've never been to Europe and I'd love to go. 

That's about all that's exciting with me... I'm doing pretty well in school, I got an awesome mark on my historiography paper, and my prof said my tutorial presentation was very good today for women in Greece. Dan and I got our mark back for our tutorial presentation for early modern Europe; it was ok, but not as well as we would have liked. It's a bit unfair because we were the first ones to go and the guidelines were pretty much just 'do the readings and prepare questions on them'. Oh well, life goes on I guess. 

So tomorrow's tuesday... eep. :S"

And no one let me buy the tourbook... it's so much money what with shipping and all... but he is so purdy and adorable... maybe I'll ask for it for Christmas. Of course he couldn't have just used the same tourbook from last year (I mean it's the same theme: Christmas) which I already have and spent a crapload of money on to save me from this dilemna. 


And he's not singing Angels We Have Heard On High... boourns to him. 

I so wanna go to this concert!!! I know I already got to go to the Jukebox tour and I should be thankful for that, but Christmas music + Clay... my two favourite things!!! :(

Oh yes and we are apparently getting the new album in the first half of 2006. Here's the timeline so far of 'next album news':

Summer 2004: we were supposed to be getting it spring of 2005. 
Spring 2005: It'll be out fall 2005. 
Summer 2005: Early 2006. 
Now: First half of 2006.


No one yell at me. I'm just being facetious. I actually think it's good he's taking his time with it. If it means better quality, I'm all for it. I have Joyful Noise 2 clack to tide me over for now."

Ok, quick update: 
Placement went really well this week I think. Both my host teachers are really great and it shows me two different teaching styles. My host teacher for history is a really fantastic teacher and kind of reminds me of my grade 10 science teacher crossed with my grade 11 religion teacher (my fave teacher ever). 

The main group I worked with was the grade 10 applied history. They're kind of a handful, but they're a pretty good group of kids. I taught a total of five classes, covering the 1920's then the Great Depression. Last friday I taught a lesson on the Persons case then divided them into two groups to argue in front of a mock supreme court. As I learned, it's a good idea in theory, but when you're working with applied kids, not so much. They didn't follow the rules I set out for them at all and it pretty much just turned into a shouting match between the two sides. Despite that, it at least seems like they learned something, I hope. 

Then on wednesday the teacher wanted to cover some stuff with them first, so I only got about fifteen minutes to teach my lesson, which ended up being just an overhead on the causes of the Depression. And listening to those kids complain about how long the overhead I made them was (it was one page!!) I told them they'd probably die if they saw some of the lecture notes I've taken. So I felt kind of guilty and promised them no more overheads.

Yesterday I taught a lesson on what life was like in the Great Depression. Again I was pressed for time so I just showed them some visuals and photos about life in the Great Depression then put on a video for them to answer questions. Then today I finally got to get through some of the stuff I had wanted to and gave them an assignment. The students have alot of energy, but they're nice kids. I was chatting with some of the girls in the class and one of them told me they think I'm a good teacher so far, which was kind of nice, but then a few more started asking me if I cut my hair and telling me it looked nice, so I got thinking they were just sucking up to get good marks, haha. 

Then yesterday something really interesting happened. After school this girl came by to talk to my host teacher. After she left, I got the whole story and it turned out she'd been kicked out of her home. The teacher spent an hour trying to sort out with one of her friends some arrangements where she'd have a place to stay and all that, and when she said she hadn't had anything to eat since the previous morning he gave her ten bucks of his own money to go buy something. So we had a big long discussion after they left, and he said he's definitely going to talk to a social worker and guidance. To sum up it was pretty eye opening about some of the other stuff teachers deal with. But that's what I really like about this teacher, he really cares about his students and wants them to do well. 

Oh and monday my host teacher invited me to the staff meeting, which was kind of interesting because they had a police officer come to talk to the teachers about lockdown procedures. It was scary stuff, but necessary. 

So that was my week. Must go to bed now."

We're getting this gorgeous sheer green Indian fabric as a backing then our actual drapes are a beige background with a taupe, green and cranberry floral pattern. It's going to look so pretty!! It's going to be expensive, because we need lots since we have a cathedral ceiling, but we decided it's worth it. The odyssey is finally over, yay!"

"event","Did you know that some people have not even heard about the genocide in Rwanda? For placement the grade 11 english class I'm in is doing a unit on human rights and the teacher is having them watch 'Hotel Rwanda'. And some of the students had no clue what it was about. Several of them were like 'you mean this actually happened?' Geez. 

It was interesting, some of them really didn't give a damn and others were really shocked and moved by it. During one scene one girl actually went to the teacher's desk to get some kleenex because she was crying. It is definitely a very powerful movie and really raises awareness; during the movie alot of the students were asking 'why couldn't the U.S. do anything'? and the teacher had to explain to them it's not that they COULDN'T, it's that they WOULDN'T because they just didn't care. There was one scene where one of the tutsis asked a reporter to show footage of the slaughter on the evening news in hope that it would make the American government do something, to which the reporter replied 'you know what most people are going to do if they see that on the news? They'll watch it, say ""oh my God, that's horrible"" then go back to eating their dinner'. It think that scene really hit home with alot of the students because it's so true. 

Anyways that's my food for thought for the day. I'm definitely renting that movie so I can see the whole thing. It really puts things into perspective. Oh yeah and Don Cheadle so should have won the oscar for best actor."

"event","Tribute to Nice Girls


To the nice girls who are overlooked, who become friends and nothing more, who spend hours fixating upon their looks and their personalities and their actions because it must be they that are doing something wrong.


This is for the girls who don't give it up on the first date, who don't want to play mind games, who provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they've heard a thousand times.


This is for the girls who understand that they aren't perfect and that the guys they're interested in aren't either, for the girls who flirt and laugh and worry and obsess over the slightest glance, whisper, touch, because somehow they are able to keep alive that >hope that maybe... maybe this time he'll have understood.


This is a homage to the girls who laugh loud and often, who are comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots, who care more than they should for guys who don't deserve their attention.


This is for those girls who have been in the trenches, who have watched other girls time and time again fake up and make up and fuck up the guys in their lives without saying a word.


This is for the girls who have been there from the beginning  and have heard the rite words of advice, from ""there are plenty of fish in the sea,"" to ""time heals all wounds."" This is to honor those girls who know that guys are just as scared as they are, who know that they deserve better, who are seeking to find it.


This is for the girls who have never been in love, but know  that it's an experience that they don't want to miss out on. For the girls who have sought a night with friends and been greeted by a night of catcalling, rude comments and explicit invitations that they'd rather not have experienced.


This is for the girls who have spent their weekends sitting on the sidelines of a beer pong tournament or a case race, or playing Florence Nightingale for a vomiting guy friend or a comatose crush, who have received a drunk phone call just before dawn from someone who doesn't care enough to invite them over but is still  willing to pass out in their bed.


This is for the girls who have left sad song lyrics in their away messages, who have tried to make someone understand through a subliminally appealing profile, who have time and time again dropped their male friend hint after hint after hint only to watch him chase after the first blonde girl in a skirt.


This is for the girls who have been told that they're too good  or too smart or too pretty, who have been given compliments as a way of breaking off a relationship, who have ever been told they  are only wanted as a friend.


This one's for the girls who you can take home to mom, but won't because it's easier to sleep with a whore than foster a relationship; this is for the girls who have been led on by  words and kisses and touches, all of which were either only true for the moment, or never real to begin with.


This is for the girls who have allowed a guy into their head and heart and bed, only to discover that he's just not ready, he's just not over her, he's just not looking to be tied down; this is  for the girls who believe the excuses because it's easier to believe that it's not that they don't want you, it's that they don't want anyone.


This is for the girls who have had their hearts broken and  their hopes dashed by someone too cavalier to have cared in the first place; this is for the nights spent dissecting every word and syllable and inflection in his speech, for the nights when you've returned home alone, for the nights when you've seen from  across the room him leaning a little too close, or standing a little too near, or talking a little too softly for the girl he's with to be a random hookup.


This is for the girls who have endured party after party in his presence, finally having realized that it wasn't that he didn't want a relationship: it was that he didn't want you. I honor you for the night his dog died or his grandmother died or his little brother crashed his car and you held him, thinking that if you  only comforted him just right, or said the right words, or rubbed his back in the right way then perhaps he'd realize what it was that he already had. This is for the night you realized that it would  never happen, and the sunrise you saw the next morning after failing to sleep.


This is for the ""I really like you, so let's still be friends"" comment after you read more into a situation than he ever intended; this is for never realizing that when you choose friends, you seldom choose those which make you cry yourself to sleep. This is for the hugs you've received from your female friends, for the nights they've reassured you that you are beautiful and intelligent and amazing and loyal and truly worthy of a great guy; this is for the despair you all felt as you sat in the aftermath of your  tears, knowing that that night the only companionship you'd have was  with a pillow and your teddy bear.


This is for the girls who have been used and abused, who have endured what he was giving because at least he was giving something; this is for the stupidity of the nights we've  believed that something was better than nothing, though his something was nothing we'd have ever wanted.


This is for the girls who have been satisfied with too little and who have learned never to expect anything more: for the girls who don't think that they deserve more, because they've been conditioned for so long to accept the scraps thrown to them by guys.


This is what I don't understand. Men sit and question and whine that girls are only attracted to the mean guys, the guys who berate them and belittle them and don't appreciate them and don't want them; who use them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest will be made. Men complain that they never  meet nice girls, girls who are genuinely interested and compelling,  who are intelligent and sweet and smart and beautiful; men despair that no good women want to share in their lives, that girls play  mind games, that girls love to keep them hanging. Yet, men, I ask you: were you to meet one of these genuinely interested, thrillingly compelling, interesting and intelligent and sweet and beautiful and smart girls, were you to give her your number and wait for her to call... and if you were to receive a call from her the next day and she, in her truthful, loyal, intelligent and straightforward nice girl fashion, were to tell you that she finds you intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend, would you or would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the ""stalker chick"" you'd met the night prior, who called you and wore her heart on her sleeve and told the truth? And would you, or would you not, refuse to make plans with her, speak with her, see her again, and once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once more for this ""nice girl"" who you just cannot seem to find? Because therein lies the truth, guys: we nice girls are everywhere. But you're not looking for a nice girl. You're not looking for someone genuinely interested in your intramural basketball game, or your anatomy midterm grade, or that argument you keep having with your father; you're looking for a quick fix, a night when you can pretend to have a connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the condom  you were using during it.


So don't say you're on the lookout for nice girls, guys, when you pass us up on every step you take. Sometimes we go undercover; sometimes we go in disguise: sometimes when that girl in the low cut shirt or the too tight miniskirt won't answer your catcalls, sometimes you're looking at a nice girl in whore's clothing - - we might say we like the attention, we might blush and giggle and turn back to our friends, but we're all thinking the same thing: ""This isn't me. Tomorrow morning, I'll be wearing a tee-shirt and flannel shorts, I'll have slept alone and I'll be making my hungover best friend breakfast. See through the disguise. See me."" You never do. Why ITS WRONG? Because you only see the exterior, you only see the slutty girl who welcomes those advances. You don't want the nice girl.. so don't say you're looking for a relationship: relationships take time and energy and intent, three things we're willing to extend - - but in return, we're looking for compassion and loyalty and trust, three things you never seem willing to express. Maybe nice guys finish last, but in the race they're running they're chasing after the whores and the sluts and the easy-targets... the nice girls are waiting at the finish line with water and towels and a congratulatory hug (and yes, if she's a  nice girl and she likes you, the sweatiness probably won't matter), hoping against hope that maybe you'll realize that they're the ones that you want at the end of that silly race.


So maybe it won't last forever. Maybe some of those guys in that race will turn in their running shoes and make their way to the concession stand where we're waiting; however, until that happens, we still have each other, that silly race to watch, and all the chocolate we can eat (because what's a concession stand at a race without some chocolate?)"

"event","I am really, really angry about something...

My mom's cousin Bob was killed in a helicopter crash a few weeks ago. He had been a pilot all his life and had just recently got his helicopter's license and was going for a ride in his private helicopter along with a friend of his. Both men were killed in the crash. There's still an investigation of some kind going on but it looks like the tail rotor came apart in midair and that's what caused the crash. So basically, because of a manufacturer's error two people lost their lives. At thanksgiving dinner tonight my great aunt told me that the friend's family is planning on sueing. When I first heard that I thought she meant the manufacturer but then my mom told me no, the family is also suing Bob's estate. WTF? This just makes me so angry... because it wasn't his fault, yes he was the pilot but there was nothing he could do when the rotor came apart, in fact the paper said he did everything he could to avoid crashing into a nearby farmhouse and managed to maneuver the helicopter to a hayfield instead. It was a manufacturer's error, it was not his fault, but now this family insists on putting another already grieving family who are going through hell right now through this crap and basically saying 'it was your husband/dad's fault that this happened, we're gonna blame it on him'. My dad said that the insurance companies will probably take caer of it and it won't even make it to court, but still...they don't deserve to be put through this, they already have enough to deal with. This just makes me so mad... sorry I just had to vent."

"event","Ok, seriously, what the hell is up with my body?

Get your minds out of the gutter you perverts. Ok, I spent the entire summer (except the last part of august) dieting (and falling off the wagon a few times) and excercising intensely on average 4-5 times a week. Seriously? I feel like I didn't lose a pound and it made no difference. 

The last month or so, I haven't really been excercising, at least not like I did in the summer, I haven't been dieting and I feel like I've probably gained weight if anything. So what does my mom say to me today? ""You look like you've lost weight since the beginning of september, are you sure you've been eating enough?"" WTF? I have no idea if that's actually true or if she's just saying that to boost my self-esteem or whatever, but I remember she said something similar to me in february - after the holiday season, when people typically GAIN weight? 

WTF is up with my metabolism? Why is it every single time I really want to shed some pounds, NOTHING happens, but when I'm not really trying people say I've lost weight - same thing happened last year. I seriously must have the most screwed up metabolism ever!! 

I guess if I'm following the pattern correctly, thanksgiving weekend should actually help me LOSE weight!! I guess it should typically be somethign to be happy about, but it's just... frustrating and a little weird. 

But I am going to try to get into the workout habit again, I'm going to start taking Shadow for more walks and also go to the AC on tuesday nights and wednesday mornings... hopefully that won't screw up my metabolism even moreso. It's just.. GAH, weird."

"event","You know why my brother and I don't get along? Cuz he's a sexist pig. 

I'm not even in the door yet before he made a comment about how 'a woman's place belongs in the kitchen'. Usually I just ignore him when he says stuff like that but it gets to a point where enough is enough and I said in a really pissed off tone 'could you please stop saying stuff like that? Because I really find it offensive'. You know what he does? He laughs. My mom told him to cut it out but he was just like 'but it's too easy!'. 

Maybe I'm taking this too seriously but you know what, I don't appreciate sexist comments, even if they are meant as a joke, that essentially say that I'm worthless and not good for anything except serving a bunch of lazy men. You have two hands just like I do, make your own freaking dinner for once. 

And another thing - like father like son really rings true here. When you grow up with a father who refuses to partake in any domestic responsibilities because he grew up in a traditional strict family, you're going to think that making sexist comments like that is ok. I love my dad but even I admit that he likes to live in the past where men have all the power and all women are just meek and submissive. And you know maybe I'm being a little harsh but I'm just so sick of this crap. 

In conclusion, I love them, they're my family but both my brother and my dad can be such a bunch of mysogynistic pigs sometimes I just want to SCREAM. 

Ok I've vented, I feel better, I'm done."

A: It's so nice to know you care about me Stacey.

Dan: The biology department has these erochnipods (?)
Ashie: That's where our landlord is!!
Dan: Your landlord is an erochnipod?
Ashie: No silly, she works in the biology department.
Dan: Oh. 

Stacey: I brought the Bible home.
Ashie: The Bible? Why would you bring the Bible home with you?
Stacey: Ashie?? The BIBLE!!
~Ashie turns around to see Stacey holding a copy of 'Cosmopolitan'~
Ashie: Oh, the BIBLE!!

Ok I'm going to do a quick update before my internet craps out on me again (grrrr!!!:@) I currently have a cold and am being forced to take a regiment of pills and syrup and this God-awful crap known as Neo-Citrine. Now I know why Ashie kept calling it 'Ass water'. UGH. 

Anyways school's good, Dan and I did our tutorial presentation yesterday for Early Modern Europe which I think went pretty well. I was kind of nervous about it but we were pretty well-prepared and we actually had some pretty good discussions. Plus it's good that it's out of the way and overwith plus we were the first ones to go so the Prof shouldn't be too hard on us. Only thing I'm disappointed about is that I didn't get to see Ashie argue with Dan about churching, cuz that would have been amusing, especially since I listened to her rant about it for ten minutes before class. 

I'm also loving my sociology of gender class, for our research paper we're allowed to do any topic we want so I've decided I'm going to do mine on eating disorders, because that's a topic I could go on about for twenty pages easy. We're also allowed to use sources like magazines and tv shows so it'll be really fun to rip those apart. Btw, does anyone have any suggestions for specific tv shows I could use? 


Ok, that's it for now cuz it's bed-time. (Hopefully I won't have nightmares after 'Lost' tonight. Shark + scary possessed children of the corn type people? Jeepers)."

"event","I just found out that my mom's cousin was killed in a helicopter crash. I don't even know what I'm feeling right now... we weren't really close. The last time I saw him was last thanksgiving when he invited us up to his cottage up north. His family lives in British Columbia so we don't get to see them very often. But the little time I did spend with him I enjoyed. He was a great guy. 

My mom said the funeral will probably be this weekend in ptbo. I hate funerals. And I hate seeing my mom cry. It's just pretty shocking."

"event","So I am all moved in with my Ashie and my Stacey!! I can tell you right now after five days with those two that I am going to be completely corrupted by april, that is if I don't waste away from laughing so much (it's been medically proven that if you laugh alot you lose weight). Whether it be Lost marathons with Ashie or Stacey trying to copp a feel (:O) I love where I am right now and this year has got off to a really good start I think :)

I had to drop studies in the novel (boourns) but it works out because now I get to take women in Greece and Rome which is a course I really wanted to take last year but couldn't fit it into my schedule. Coned on monday was pretty good - I got to see Pam, Dan, Keith, the whole ConEd gang. Then tuesday was HotProf day!!! I mean, we had Early Modern Europe which I can tell right now is going to be my favourite course. Not just because of Siena, but I have been looking forward to this course since before I started first year. And Siena is an awesome Prof. Good thing Ashie's in the class with me so she can hold my drool bucket. 

Anyways, the rest of my classes are good - I have Canadian history with Pam and Karen and it sounds like a cool course, as well as Sociology of Gender (now I can get credit for my feminist rants!!). I'm not so sure about Age of Dickens. Maybe that's because the prof spent half the class ranting about the politics of budget cuts at the university instead of talking about other stuff. But overall I'm really happy with all my classes and everything. And I have thursdays and fridays off, so yay for that!! This is going to be a really good year.


P.S. Mmmmm... peanut butter :P"

<TR>
<TD>Based on the results of this test, it is highly likely that: <BR><BR>You prefer your romance and love to be traditional rather than daring or out-of-the-ordinary, you would rather be pursued than do the pursuing and, when it comes to physical love, your satisfaction comes more from providing a wonderful time to your partner than simply seeking your own. <BR><BR>This places you in the Lover Style of: <B>The Devoted Lover</B>. <BR><BR>The Devoted Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and is perhaps the best Lover Style when it comes to developing a long-term, caring and rewarding relationship. The Devoted Lover is a treasure to find, though it is sometimes difficult to time establishing a relationship with one just right; usually, this is the last romantic relationship you'll need to find, so sow any wild oats first. <BR><BR>In terms of physical love, the Devoted Lover can be shy at first but gradually warms and eventually can be a thrilling partner who knows every need of his/her partner. Given a strong and loving relationship, and the right lover, the Devoted Lover can be a delight in bed. <BR><BR>Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Suave Lover (most of all) or the Classic Lover, or the Carnal Lover. <BR><BR>Congratulations! <BR><BR>If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback!

"event","So last wednesday was my last day of work which I'm kind of sad about. Monday and tuesday I didn't see HGI at all so I was pretty sad but then wednesday on my way to the office to get the prosecution reports I saw his computer was on at his desk and when I walk into the office guess who's there? But he was in the middle of a conversation with someone so he just gave me a quick 'hi'. He ws in there for quite a while so I saw him a few times when going in and out of the office. Those were the only times I saw him, so I didn't really get to say a formal goodbye to him :( But I had seen him two weeks earlier where I talked to him about my program and he wished me luck and stuff, so I guess that could be my goodbye. I'm going to miss him :(

Since it was my last day my boss and everyone in my division took me out for lunch which was really nice of them. And I found out I can come back to the branch next summer - the director came by to say goodbye and explained it to me - typically students are only allowed to work two summers in the same branch, but my boss twisted some arms and human resources said I could come back but they have to go through the reinterviewing process etc. 

So I said goodbye to everyone which was kind of sad - I really like the people I work with and I think this is the only job I've ever had, aside from my library job, where I truly felt appreciated for the work I did. Even the investigators who weren't in my division were really friendly and always said thank you when I did something for them. And of course Hot Greek Investigator who was friendly and served the role of imaginary bf all summer. 

Friday - monday was really nice in that my dad left for L.A. to visit my mom and my brother went on a rafting trip with some friends so I had the whole house to myself. Peace and quiet without the disturbance of men. It was quite nice. 

My sleeping patterns were thown wa off over the course of a few days so of course getting up before 6 yesterday wasn't very fun. There was a bit of a hassle in that there was some confusion over who my host teacher would be (grrr) but I got it all worked out. Classes I'm in are grade 11 behavioural science (psychology, sociology, anthropology) grade 11 english, and grade ten Canadian history. I love my host teacher for behavioural science and history - he's really friendly and funny and enthusiastic and an awesome teacher and he seems to really be passionate about his job. I also realy like my host teacher for english. 

Yesterday the teacher was talking to the class about what they'll be studying and he mentioned schizophrenia which got me thinking. After school we were talking and I asked him if he's ever seen the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' and he said he wanted to because he'd heard good things about it, so I suggested showing it to the class when they do the unit on psychology where they deal with schizophrenia and of course I started rambling about how great the movie is and he asked me if he could borrow it and also if I'd like to prepare some lessons on it which I'm ecstatic about. I also mentioned that I could do some lessons on the sociology of gender since I'm taking a course on that and he said that would be great. 

I also really like him because he's really inclusive and eager to involve me etc; today for the grade ten class I led themi n a reading and alot of the students had trouble keeping up and paying attention. I had a slight case of nerves which I think threw me a bit. Afterwards the teacher mentioned that he was given six special needs students in the class but just looking at them during today's lesson he can tell there are many more students with high needs so he suggested that tomorrow he give them some sort os excercise then afterwards he and I can look through them and determine who the at-risk students are and then pair them with other students who can help them and create a sort of buddy system. So I'm really looking forward to that. 

And grrr I think I'm getting sick again; the last two days I was so tired when I got home I just slept for about two hours. High school students take alot out of you!! 

That's about it with me. I'm moving on saturday so I should probably try to get a move on with the packing soon. So much to do! 

And one of these days I will update about the Clay concert and my L.A. trip."

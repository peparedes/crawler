"event","it's really sad that the only thing i long for right now is someone to cuddle with occasionally. nothing more nothing less, just someone to cuddle with every now and then. i just miss the comfort of having someone next to me. there really truly doesn't have to be anything more than a quick cuddle and i'll feel a lot better. i haven't been sleeping very well and when i finally do get to sleep i dream such realistic dreams about all sorts of different people.


my heads everywhere right now. my throat is sore as fuck and my back still hurts like a bitch. i've got a lot on my mind. more than just wishing i had someone to cuddle with.


i've realized that i think a lot of people don't pursue the things they want in all aspects of life just simply out of fear. people should't be afraid to do the things they want just out of fear of what others will think. it's your life, and you make it what you want to make it. i think everyone would be  A LOT happier, if they just listened to what they truly want, rather than trying to please everyone else.



ugh theres so much more but i can't even express that now. it's too confusing"

lately i've just been feeling so much more adult. i really like it. as scared as i am to actually grow up in a whole, i'm really happy to say i look forward to all the good and bad that follows in my future.


my attitude has been very good lately. don't get me wrong i've been pretty low on and off over the past couple of months, but for the most part i'm being positive and just moving forward taking each day as it comes.

"event","i'm so tired and all i want to do is finish my reports on five of the pictures on my collage for my america in the 60s class but so far i've only finished one on Andy Warhol. I wish they didn't have to be so detailed! i wrote such a long thing on Warhol i feel like writing anything else will take sooooo long and it won't be as good as the first. I started one on woodstock, and i've pretty much planned out what other pictures i'd like to describe but i just have no motivation to do so right now. I have another day to do it anyway so it's not like it matters but i really wanted to get it all done and just hand it in tomorrow so i can leave after my 3rd period final on wednesday. Tomorrows finals will be easy. Journalism i just have to pass in my binder, and graphic design i have to make an ad. should be a piece of cake. i wish i knew why i was so tired. marilene was here earlier and i just kind of laid on my bed with my eyes closed for like an hour. i probably fell asleep on and off which should make me less tired now but of courseeee it doesn't. i'm honestly probably going to post this then lay in bed. i wish it didn't hurt my body to sit here just a little longer though. just a little longer without pain and i'd probably be able to get at least my woodstock report done, or i'd be able to talk to someone which is what i want to do the most. i just want to talk to someone, anyone. i'm almost trying to start conversations via text lately because my body just can't take it to sit here and type. my wrists start to ache, my back constantly hurts, my legs get sore, my shoulders, just everything. i end up wanting to lay in my bed every second of everyday and thats where i'm headed now. my lymph nodes thankfully stopped being swollen and painful. that actually scared my dad because most of the time that means cancer (but i wasn't worried about that) i looked it up under lyme disease though and it is another symptom of it so thankfully wednesday i'll be able to put an end to all this wonder. marilene rubbed my back for a little while today, it felt good for the most part but my back was really tender to touch in some spots and i felt like she was stabbing me half the time. i'm done ranting, i really just wish i had someone to talk to right now. it's not even that i'm upset or anything, i just feel like i have so much to say and no one to say it to. i miss jason. i'm used to seeing him for so many hours of the day and when i don't get to it's like i have a million extra things to say. i just ramble to him for hours upon hours in the car. i love that, i love just talking."

"event","this movie really hits every little bit of me on the inside and out. my heart is bursting with this kind of joyous sadness. i'm not really sad, but it makes me think and my heart just explodes watching it. my eyes are a bit teary too but it's more of a wondering kind of tear if that makes any sense at all. it just goes along with what i've always thought. i wonder if it'd be this way for me. i wonder if even if some people didn't do exactly what they do in this movie, if they'd at least want to do it. i'd want to do it. more than anything. as a matter of fact i probably would do something of the sort even if it didn't change anyones mind. in order for me to feel okay i'd have to do it. i'd have to at least make the effort to stop it. i'm going to watch it again. i'd forgotten how good it was, i mean i knew it was good, but it really hits home more now i guess. just the music that plays on the selection screen makes me feel something on the inside. like my heart is just bursting at the seams (if there were any seams on your heart), like i'm completely unstoppable. it's the unstoppable force. the unstopable force they talk about. call me crazy but it all makes sense. it's all real. it's so very real.


one day i'm going to write a beautiful book. i hope it makes at least one person feel the way certain things i read make me feel. every movie starts out with a written story. then it's just put into play form if it isn't written that way already. everyone has their own stories to share, their own fantasies to reveal in the most creative of ways. i want to do that. i talked to jason tonight about how i could never be a journalist because what true meaning does reporting on news really give out to people? yeah you let them know what's going on but i want my writing to have depth to it. more depth than any article on the news could ever possibly amount to. i will write a beautiful novel. more than one if the first one comes out good enough. i will make someone feel the way i feel now. like there is some sort of hope out there. there is hope out there. everyone always hopes for at least one thing even if it's nothing of this sort. everyone wants something out of life, everyone NEEDS certain things out of life. i'll give them that. one day, everyone will see it how i see it. one day everything will work out the way it should. fate has never done me wrong thus far, and one day everyone will believe in it as much as i do. one day all this heartache and all the disappointment everyone faces will be worth it. in the end, it's worth every bit of hell. we will all see it."

vacation is the week after next and as excited as i am for a week away from school it scares me to death because i know that after it theres like NO school left. reality is just going to bitch slap me and i know it. i'm scared to really start growing up more so than i already have. i'm scared to go to college, i'm scared to move out of this house (even if it's just to move in with my dad) i'm scared of what's going to happen with people i know now, and who i will meet next. i just want everything to work out in the end. i want to be happy and successful and i know i will get there one day, but it scares me to think of what lies ahead. this is the beginning of a completely new chapter in the story of my life. i know i'm not alone in feeling like this which gives me the slightest bit of relief but i can't help but to wonder what the future holds and who will be holding onto it with me."

(no seriously the nurse i had looked EXACTLY like him. my dad was like ""hey doesn't that look like what's his name? and i was just like YES YES IT DOES.) the nurse who took me to get my x-ray was hot as all hell. when she took me back to the room she was pulling the stretcher (yes they carted me around on a stretcher it was embarassing haha) from the front and ohhhh man she was hot haha. after she left my dad was like ""i'd do her."" and i chimed in and said ""so would i."" my dad about pissed himself but really she was absolutely gorgeous. then the doctor came in and told me that i pretty much ruined all the tendons and ligaments in my foot. so now i have to wear this ugly shoe thing for a week and walk on crutches. he perscribed me some vikes too. THEN MY DAD LEAVES MY REGULAR SHOE THERE! so my favorite vans of all time now are nothing because they're no longer a pair. he felt so bad he said he'd just buy me a new pair, but it's not the same. tomorrow i have to go to the nurse in the morning so i can get a note to get out of class five minutes early and have someone carry my shit. i suck at walking on crutches though so i can only imagine how annoying it's going to be having to not walk on my left foot for a week. if we don't start seeing improvement by the end of next week i have to go to therapy so strenghten the shit i screwed up. i've yet to take any of my vikes so i think i'll do that now and just pass out for awhile. i feel extremely exhausted for some reason. oh and there was a drunk guy on watch across from me being weird as all hell. it made for an entertaining morning but i couldn't wait to leave."

on another note, it's not that i couldn't get the money, it's that i really don't want to give it to you because you HAVE a job. yeah you have expenses but stop thinking i don't have any just because i don't have a job or a car. i do have to pay money for my cell phone, i do have to help buy shit for my house, i do have to put gas in my moms car when i take it, i do have to pay for things for school and i DO have to save money myself for my own car, for college,and  for a bunch of other shit. i shouldn't have to bend over backwords to give you 30 bucks when you have a job and you're getting paid in a few weeks. not my fault if you don't have money before then. and don't sit here and tell me to get a job already either because after you left the nursing home job it was a long time before you got a new job. i have been looking, and applying places and you of all people should know it's not always easy. i want to give you the money back eventually, but i really don't know when that will be."

i got some color at the beach haha, weird. me with a tan? next saturday my mom goes away. i still need someone to spend friday and saturday with me. i mean i'm thinking about having a party saturday, but if i don't then i want at least one person with me. marilene told me she would, but it's her three year anniversary. i don't think she realized it was when she told me she'd stay so i'll have to ask someone else.

but whatever if this is what you want then i don't care anymore. this has happened to me too many times for me to even let it bother me. if you change your mind, and if you ever need someone when there's no one else, well you know what to do then."

i know i've been a pain in the ass, i know i've been a jealous bitch, i know i've cried for hours beyond hours without saying a word, i know i've been such an annoyance to everyone, but i really can't help it.


i'm sorry i've been bitchy, and sarcastic beyond belief to everyone, especially <i>you</i>. i'm sorry that i can't explain in full why i've been feeling like this. i'm sorry that i'm probably making everyone miserable.


just please don't give up on me... especially not <i>you</i>. as much as i know i've been being a fucking crazy bitch to you, i need you, and i've told you that time and time again. it's not because of everything i said the other night either, it's because you're just one person i know i can talk to. i hope i didn't fuck it up, but i've just been so out of my element. just please.... ]; ..... please forgive me, and don't give up.

i'm just going crazy. i should stop blaming other people. i'm the crazy one. i wish i could write what i want but i can't. i wish EVERYTHING was different. NOT even because of tonight because of everynight. not even because of you, because of almost everyone.


i can't do this anymore. i can't. i need to get out, get away. i'd like to put that none of you would care, but i'd be lying. i still believe you wouldn't care much though. with the exception of a very select few.

seriously. i'm so glad at least one of the girls i was talking to isn't a shallow fucking slut who is like fucking 12. i'm disgusted with myself that i even had the slightest bit of a crush on her.


on the other hand i am really starting to think that things may be going somewhere with someone else. i'm not rushing it, i'm just happy to know she definitely is interested, and i'm interested in her.


and on ANOTHER note, I'M SO HAPPY FOR EMILY MORGAN!!!!!! her boyfriend did the cutest thing for her today, and i'm extremely jealous but in a good way. she deserves this more than anyone i know <3 ILY BABY!"

"event","i want to start over completely, and apparently that is the theme of this week. numerous people have said those words to me this week. i feel almost cliche saying them too, but it's true. i want to not feel so alone, i want to NOT feel guilty for things i've done in which were not wrong at all. i want to stop smoking cigarettes, i want to stop smoking weed so i can get a job, i want i want i want.



i seriously wish life didn't consist of everyone simply wanting things. half the things the entire human race think they need, are only things they want.


i wish i knew what we actually need now a days.

i know whatever those things may be, are nothing that i want.

i do know that i need to stop being so afraid of what lies ahead.
that is the only thing i've been certain about for months.

so why is it that i still find myself WANTING to sit here and not move forward?

i don't like anyone, or anything including myself.
i mean i do, but i don't.

i feel bitter.
i want someone to change this for me.
haha this whole thing is such a gigantic contradiction in my mind.

here i am bitching about how all we do as people is want, and i write how i WANT someone to change my mind. i WANT someone to make me change my views. i WANT......

i want so much, but do i really NEED any of it?


[EDIT:]

i have no fucking clue why i'm incredibly jealous of <i>you</i> but i fucking am and everything about you bothers me. it also bothers me how you'd never ever talk to this person if you never heard me talk about them. i want to fucking slit my throat and die right now.


okay so that was dramatic but i seriously hate you for the way you make me feel and for the way you are. you're so fucking fake and apparently i am the only one who sees through it."

FOR THE PAST YEAR, that is what i've been through. it makes me scared to like someone new, but i do, oh i do. there's just something about her, something soooo very good about her that i'm drawn to. i'm baffled as to why she hasn't said one word to me yet, and i'm nauseated at the fact that she picks today, the day we're going to hang out, to not answer me right away. it makes me so unsure. i hate being ignored. i hate having that feeling of uncertainty. i know i'm overreacting but i still can't help but to feel that way. it's just how i am. i'm going to go take a shower. hopefully she's IMed me back by then.

no one has gone through everything i have gone through.
sure everyone has once been where i am in a sense, but i bet it
was no where near how fucked up it is for me.


none of you care.
don't fucking tell me otherwise either.
you'd care if it was <i>them</i>.

i'm pissed off at a few people. i can't believe i let myself do this AGAIN! i want to run away. nothing at home is really going wrong, just my life is going wrong. i don't want to see anyone. it hurts too much to see some people anyway, and when i say that, i mean some of the best people i know.


today has been miserable. it didn't start out that way, although i had a feeling it would. i even told alex it would turn to shit. i hate being right about things before they happen. i hate being head over heels for someone who has no idea, i hate how even though i know for a FACT i'm head over heels for that person, i still like other people, even though i should because.. i just should. i have no idea why i'm bothering to write this. i'm filtering it anyway because i know <i>you</i> will read it.


i seriously need to get away, and not come back. i'm sorry to say it, but i would probably hardly miss anyone. i'm exaggerating of course, i'd miss a select few people, but of course those select few, are people who unintentionally make me hurt inside. i mean they don't even know i'm hurting.


i feel selfish. i feel like dying.

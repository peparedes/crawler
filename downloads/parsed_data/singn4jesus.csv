"event","HEY HEY GUYS!

SO yep yep life is going good....

I still love my job....although some D-U-M (lol) stuff happened.

school is still ok ...BLAH!

I can't wait for this summer...YEAH!

oh ok so something embarressing...

   On Tuesday I decided to skip out on my math class (lol), and like usual I slept in and  I was running late for english. I was running down the stairs of he parking garage and fell down the stairs. OK so beyond the embarrement factor...I twisted my ankle pretty bad and for some odd reasons I thought that I had developed an acute case of amnesia. So just picture my laying on the ground saying ""my name is annie barrett and i live at ....."". lol ok yes I agree this is very amusing now but at the time i was so scared I would forget who I am. After I asured myself I knew who I was I then had to devise I plan for getting down 2 more flights of stairs without breaking my neck.... yes yes I know I had to make it look graceful. lol hahahaha well that didn't happen I managed to make it down a few stairs to an elevator where I took that up to my car....
hahahaha yep yep that was my near death experience for the week.
After I had my dad look at it he told to me to go home and put ice on it...but i didn't comply. I went out to lunch with Teresa and Robin from Christian Challenge. 

Right now I'm chillin with Lynsey.
We are talking about old times and I'm trying to help her get ready to move out on her own. All this to say I'm the older one in college helping her get ready for college and she had to teach me how to do laundry....yep yep some how thats ironic ...yes

OK so I should go
talk to ya later gator!
          God Bless!
                Annie"

I don't mean to brag.....wait yes I do.
 
The bible says to boast in the Lord and let me tell you all these things are only of God.


God is still teaching me things...
   why certain things happen
   why things have to change
   why people turn away
   and not to worry about these things


but i know in the end all the glory goes to God, so its all good yo. lol"

I love this night more then any other. 
I know I don't need to hear the whole speech each year(I've made the commitment and I'm sticking with it), but I know that there are kids there each year that need that talk like no other.
Pastor Mike does a great job each year with it. 
Its not too serious to where we can laugh and joke around, but at the same time he breaks it down to the truth. 

This week-end was good!

The past 6 months I have been praying about what God wants me to do in the near future. I know that I am supossed to do the whole seminary thing, and I am so excited about that! And I know I'm going to be a counselor at centrifuge next summer and hopefully every summer after that, but my heart was longing for a mission opp. this summer.

So I am praying about taking a year off of school to do some type of mission work. I don't know what, but I totally realized today in church that my life is not my own. And the only way I will be able to let God use me fully is by allowing Him to put me somewhere I have no control over. Where God is in total control of my life and my walk. And the amazing thing is I'm not scared .....I AM SO EXCITED!

So yep yep anyways I'm gonna go, but I'll talk to y'all later gator!

 God Bless!

Wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in your sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup on. Wait for the one who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares about you and how lucky he is to have you. Wait for the one who turns to his friends and says, ""...that's her.""

I got this from Kellie!
This is so true, so if you care about your heart think about these things. 
Don't just date to date......date to marry!(talk to God about it....DUH! He knows because your future is in His hands)

 I still dislike school, but I think by at least my senior year of college I could get use to this...lol.

Friday: we were all supossed to go to the mountains, but the weather was too bad. So Erin, Lance, Kenny, Mark, Seema, Kellie, Brielle, Alex, and I all went to Rock and Java to see Time Spent Burning!  I hadn't heard them in awhile, but THEY WERE STINKIN AWESOME! It is such an encouragment to see amazing men of God up on stage only for God. Yep yep....then we all went to the hang out to play pool. It was ok I guess E.T. showed up lol. I bonded with Brielle, Seema, and Kellie! Good stuff Good stuff! Erin spent the night which rocked and we stayed us forever talking

Saturday: a lot  happened so i'll skip it lol

Sunday: church of course! Riana and I did a skit in church again and it was great. After church Kylee, Kenny, Lance, Jon, Peggy, and I went out to eat. I had girls group at four, and it went really well. Its such a blessing to see girls seious about God and not being fake about it. After youth we all went over to peggy's to watch a movie and then went to the park. Jessi spent the night YEAH!

Monday: Alex woke me up at like 7 am with a text mess.....BLAH! I didn't get any sleep that day...OH WELL! We all went to a funeral for a lady at our church. I didn't really know her that well, but God sure did use her in amazing ways during her life. 
After that we went to Peggy's house to watch a movie:
      Jessi was so sick and I felt so bad for her
      Poor Mark had to work
      Alex elbowed me in the head
      IT RAINED ALL DAY!
Then we were going to go bowling, but ended up at Brielle's house YEAH! It was so much fun! We played pool and watched Cellular. Kellie, Seema, and Brielle crack me up! E.T. showed up again but they took care of it! I spent the night at Peggy's house and we talked forever!

Tuesday: I didn't go to school lol! I went over to Alex's house and hung out with him and Halley. We started to redecorate his room but it didn't work out. Then I picked up Lance from work YEAH i got starbucks lol. Later on Kellie, Brielle, Mark, Lance, Alex, Halley, and I went to sky zone. It was alright....lol. THEN WE DID TACO TUESDAY! We all went back to Brielle's house to play pool and I beat Lance! I had to drag Lance away from the pool table to got o Christian Challenge. Christian Challnge was good....Pastor Mike preached and it was awesome. Then I went home and went to bed!

Wed: I went shopping with grandma! Then at 3 went to alex's house to watch kill bill 2, but I missed the begining....I didn't quite understand why she wanted to kill bill....Then we went to church! Youth group was great last night! I took Erin home and got to see little Elijah! Lance and I went to starbucks, and then I went back over to alex's house to watch the begining of kill bill, so now I kind of understand why she wanted to kill bill. But i didn't like the movie.....the whole plucking out daryl hannah's eye freaked me out. 

So yep yep anyways 
I'm on my way to go shopping with Julia and Alyssa....talk to ya later gator!

"event","Life is great! 

I've realized a lot about my life and my future lately. 

I can't wait for seminary!
I can't wait to be doing what God has planned for me!
I just can't wait, because God has so much in store!

I've also realized many truths in my life...

Truth number one: it is better to have him as an amazing guy friend then anything else!

Truth number two: college really is as important as my parents say.

Truth number three: God gives us experiences(both bad and good) in our lives to learn from, but also      to minister to others that might be going through the same things!

Truth number four: My life isn't about me!

And I've learned to be thankful for blessings I never saw coming...

1.)  SCHOOL!
2.) BROKEN HEARTS!
3.) Learning who my true friends are...
4.) Going through having to learn what a friend is in general...

Well I should go...
I have to go pack for the mountains!

Talk to ya later gator!
  God Bless!
           -annie-

P.S. I was determined to be apethetic about this whole thing, but I do care! And I will continue to care and pray about it...and too bad if you don't like it!"

I'm so sick of him!
I'm sick of his lies, his leading me on, and basically just him in general.
I really thought that him and I were getting to be really good friends, but I guess not.......
All i really wanted was for him to be like one of my best guy friends, but he really screwed that up.
But whatever I'm sure I'll be over it by tomorrow lol!

"event","Ok so as of Sunday night I was very upset with all boys in general. I didn't care who you were, but if you were a male I disliked you! Good news God totally brought me out of that! To be honest I don't know why I was so upset but one boy made me so mad that I blammed all the problems of the world on every man. I then talked myself into believeing that I was over a guy that I wasn't really over, which didn't make Sunday night any easier. 

But like I said God brought me out of it. 

Monday was such a bad day to where I found myself wondering why I didn't just stay in bed....
But God gave me the most amazing night that night! I went and spent some time with some of the girls from Christian Challenge and God blessed my heart. Liz Sara, and I had praise band practice and there God mended my broken heart. I then realized that I can't fix everyone or their problems ( no mater how much or often I try). I can't take the trials of other people and put them on my shoulders, but I can encourage them in the Lord to where they let go of their problems and let God take care of the rest. 

Father God, 
     I ask that you use me touch everyone around me. Lord God all I want is for people to see you when they look at me. I no longer long for the earthly desires of my heart but for your will to be done as I make your desires mine. Father God, please reveal yourself to everyone that is on my heart. I want them to come to know you like never before, and for the others to return to you. You know my heart Father and I ask that the only time it will ever break again is for you and your will. 
   I pray all these things in your holy and precious name
                                       amen"

     This week-end was fun I guess....Friday Lance I hung out at my house until Jessi got home. We went and got Kenny and then went over to Jessi's house. Omg it was so funny! We were driving around and saw this guy and he was so crazy ""drinking and driving drinking and driving"" lol. Then we cruised the strip which Jessi made it funny. Then we all went home and at about 1:30....I was tired

Saturday: jessie woke me up stinking early because alex and lance had sent me a text mess so my phone kept going off lol. So we got up and went and picked up justin and alex to go do yard work at some ladies house. Thomas and Lance came and helped later on, but we still are not done so we have to go back next week. After that we went to church cause lance and alex had to practice a skit. lol justin, jessi, and I goofed off while they were practicing lol I am so funny! Then we went back to my house to chillax (BRISTI CALLED ME) and then we took justin and lance to justin's house to halp justin's mom. And jessi, alex, and I went to alex's house so jessi could do halley's hair. It turned out so cute! lol I did alex's hair and burned him with the curling iron lol oops sorry! Then we went cosmic bowling which was coolio, because Riana, nate, Alyssa, julia, and david all showed up! After that Lnace, alex, jessi, halley and I went back to alex's house and watched the simpson's. I tried to keep the guys up but it didn't happen, so jessi and I left around 1 lol. 

Sunday: Jessi and I were super late for Sunday School....what's new? We tried to come up with an amazing story on why we were late but i don't think anyone believed us....lol. Pastor Jon gave an amazing sermon. I was like whoa dang! I got to see Mr. Steve, Debbie, and Robin which rocked! After church Justin and Lance came over to my house for lunch and then we took lance to work. Justin and I went to jessi's house ....lol I fell asleep like usual. Then we had to be back at church at 4:30 so chris, erin and I could practice. Then we had youth and played volley ball and some weird form of dodge ball that my mom came up with lol ""if you can dodge traffic you can dodge balls"". After church I took Zach home and then I went home to have ""Annie time"". 

I have had the worst morning but I'll tell y'all about it later....

So life has been good. School starts back up on Tuesday and I am pretty nervous. Oh well I'll get over it.....
Christian Challenge is back up on Tuesday too! I han't been going to it for the longest time , but I'm gonna start going again. I even got ahold of Liz and Sara, so I might start playing in the band again!
I'm trying to keep in touch with all my friends old and new. I don't really know why but I can see evreyone is hurting lately so I figure everyone needs someone to talk to. It's exciting to hear how everyone is doing good and bad....it shows how God is working and how He is going to work. 
I miss Michelle! I called her yesterday, but really didn't get to talk much. Oh well I'll call her soon, and then maybe we can talk.
I miss Christina too! I've tried calling her lately, but she either doesn't return my calls or she calls me back for like 2 sec. Oh well I'll call her and maybe we can get together!
I have to go...Justin and Lance are here and I think they are making a mess of my kitchen lol

The past week has been stressful. I have had a lot of things on my mind.....i hate thinking sometimes lol. So yep yep I was thinking about schoool and seminary and my future and guys and friends and this summer and family and church and ........so as you can see my mind has been full lately lol. And then the minute I was trying to figure all of this out and how I was going to handle it all God spoke to my heart. I remembered that God has it all under control. That is the one thing I always have to remember to come back to. It is so hard for me to give up control, but things seem to all fall in place once I just hand them over to God. 

This week-end was fun. Friday night Justin, Jessi, Lance, and I all hung out at Jessi's. We had a snowball fight at like 11pm!lol
Saturday I went to Christan's baby shower and video tapped. It was such a nice baby shower and it gave everyone the opportunity to see God at work. It's so exciting to see God's blessings!
Sunday was church of course lol. Then Lynsey, Peggy, Lance, Kylee, Kenny, and I went to eat at a buffet (it was bad) and it was fun to just hang out. Then I had to be back at church at 4 and I started girls group back up. It was an amazing time just sit around, read the bible, and pray with my sisters in Christ. I was so excited to hear their hearts for God!After that I went and picked up Alex and Justin for church. Then we went to youth group and pastor Mike gave and awesome sermon! After church I had to take 7 people home in my little 5 seater sudan lol. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my life....but looking on the brite side we all bonded lol. 
Well I guess I should go

So my christmas break started about two weeks ago. I guess in college its called ""winter break"", what is that? Without christmas we wouldn't even have a break.....therefore its christmas break.


Saturday:We had the Christmas play at church, and we were all in it. It was alright...really stressful but alright. After Lance, Alex, Halley, Justin, Mark, and I all went over to Jessi's house to watch a movie. 

Sunday: We had the play again. Lance, Justin, and I got taco bell and hung out at Jessi's again.

Monday: Justin, Jessi, and I went over to Alex's house to chillax. We watched Coolrunnings! I GOT TO TALK TO HANNAH ON THE PHONE! Alex and Justin wanted to watch Kung Pow ( a movie I do not like) so i hid it in the kitchen lol. 

Tuesday: same as monday but we watched Napoleon Dynamite! 

Wed: went shopping! Picked up Justin, Alex, and halley for church.....we were 30 minutes late ( not a suprise lol). Lynsey, Jessi, Jordyn, HAlley, Alex, Justin, Lance, Kylee, and I all went to the magical fores. It was a lot of fun.....REALLY COLD THOUGH! Everyone went on the train except for Alex and me, we walked around the stupid forest of lights like 5 times lol. Justin asked out Jessi on the train! After we all walked around the forest thing AGAIN lol but Lance asked out Kylee so it was coolio. I visited Santa and asked for party in a box, but he said no lol. After we went back to Alex's hous for awhile and watched a movie.

Thursday: SHOPPING! Jessi, Lance, and I went over to Alex's house to watch a movie.I spent the night at Jessi's house!

Friday: CHRISTMAS EVE! I hung out with Lance and Alex early in the morning and then helped my G'ma wrap presents later on. Then my family and I went to candel light service at church and went home to go to bed.

Saturday: CHRISTMAS! I had a great christmas, but nothing really exciting happened. Mainly just the usual family stuff. 

Sunday: Church...DUH!lol Lance, Alex, Hank, Justin, and I hung at jessi's. The guys manily played video games wooohooo rock on! lol j/k 

Monday: P.J. DAY AT JESSI'S HOUSE! Lance, Alex, Hank, Justin, and I all went over to Jessi's house in our pajamas. lol it was great fun!

Tuesday: mainly the same thing as Monday. It rained really bad that day. I hung out with Alex at his house and we did the whole taco tuesday thing. I watched the simpsons for the first time ever! I picked up Lance from work and we went back to Alex's house and hung out for awhile. 

Wed: Party at Kylee's house! Lance, Kylle, Jessi, Alex, and I went to Kylee's and watched Napoleon Dynamite (for about the 10th time). It was fun. Then we hung out the rest of the day and went to church. 

Thursday: Hung out w/ Jessi, Justin, and Lance. We went to sky mania which was alright. Its not as fun as it used to be. We went out to eat and the best part was the van ride back when everyone was making animal sound lol. Then I went over to Christina's house and watched How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days with Christina, Shelby, and Terry. Then I cut Christina's hair and went home to sleep. 

Friday: That would be today and I'm just chillin until later today when we all got to battle of the bands. It should be a lot of fun....It makes me miss Hannah a lot cause a year ago today we were hanging out at my house getting ready for New years eve.

 sorry I havn't written in a long while, but so much has been going on. Hanging of the Greens os coming up at chuch and I am so excited about it! Christmas in general is right around the corner which rocks. The best shopping day of the year is in one week from tomorrow (the day after thanksgiving) and I can't wait to spend money lol.

But on a more serious note my heart is breaking!  I can see people falling away from God day by day....they know who they are and the worst part is the fact that they know what they need to do and turn the other way. God is so amazing and I want everyone to see and know that! It seems like everything is happening all at the same time and it is all so overwhelming. I just want everyone to be on fire for Christ and for all of us to lift each other up.

"event","HEY! Yep yep life has been good. I have been a little stressed out about some things, but its nothing too big. 

God has really shown me His plan more and more in the past week. It's so exciting to see my future more clearly! I know it's gonna be a lot of hard work but I'm ready for it.

My heart has a burden for certain people lately. I know what God wants me to do, but its the simple fact of setting myself aside and focusing on others. I need to pray that God gives me the words to talk to these people.

Well I should go! talk to ya later gator!

I've tried my best to rid these thoughts 
Of you and I 
Its so hard when you come to me 
I fall back on my knees 
I've learned to hate love 
You kiss me on the cheek 
You say you never make it without me 
Its getting harder every day...

"event","Whoever said college is the best years of your life is a liar! I loved high school and I am missing it so much right now. But I also heard that if you loved high school then you may not like college. I can't believe they actually put forth the effort to take role in class and I can only miss 4 days in my first 2 classes (I'm thinking if I'm paying you you don't tell me what to do). Thank God for my math teacher, he could care less if I'm there or not. Oh well I just hope this is the fastest 4 years of my life so that I can move on to seminary.lol

So yep yep I thought I was so lucky not having school on Monday, so I stayed up late Sunday night. But of course  my mom woke me up at like 6am to tell me something, by which I'm still not sure what she said. Then Alex called at somewhere around 6:30 am and I wasn't fully awake so I thought I answered the phone but I guess I didn't.lol
Justin texted me not much later and then Riana called twice at 9am. I'm thinking monday isn't my day to sleep in. Later on Riana and I went to check out our classes and then went to pick up Alyssa from school. Then we went and got tacos! lol

Tuesday was my first day of college! I wasn't too excited but hey what can I say. I had to get up at 5am ( so i'm sorry for teasing everybody on sunday night), and it was so hard to get motivated for school lol. Class was ok I'm just not used to secular schools since I have been in private christian school since I was 2. My dad says it will be good for me, but I think he is wrong lol. Later on that day I went to Taco Tuesday with Mark, Alex, and Stephanie (I just met her and she is coolio) then we went to Chap to watch marching band practice...I'm not sure why. It was a good night!

Gots to go

Last Thursday night we left for cali
Friday- Disneyland
Saturday- My family Reunion. I got to drive the Suburban!
Sunday- Beach
Monday- We came home
That night was so much fun! Jessie, Lance, Peggy, Mark, Kenny and I all went out to eat at Applebees. We stopped by Justin's house to pick him up, but he couldn't come with us. I don't think I ever laughed so hard.....Lance stole Justin's cell phone and Justin came out of his house after Lance and was like ""dude lance I'm going to eat you...Kenny go get the A1 sauce."" Lol so Kenny gose inside and gets butter and Peggy was like ""Is Justin really like that?!?!"" I was like "" no Peggy Justin isn't going to eat Lance"" lol 
      Its one of those things that you had to be there for. 
Then I spent the night at Jessie's house

Tuesday- Jessie and I babysat Noah. Then we went and picked up Alex from his house lol we were like 45 min late for church. We had game night at church and then went over to Peggy's house to watch a movie. Lance, Alex, Kenny and I went to get a movie and we ended up getting house on haunted hill.....It isn't that great the 2nd time through. Then Jessie spent the night with me at my sisters house

Wed- Jessie and I hung out at my house and then met up w/ mark, Lance, Alex Jeff, Alex, Bristy, Thomas, Dyani, and Shonoa at the mall. It was fun! I hadn't seen Thomas and Bristy in forever. After that Jessie and I went and picked up Kenny and went to church for water night. It was fun even though I got soaked. I got smaked in the face a couple times too lol. Then we all went over to Jessie's house to watch fear dot com. It was a okay movie... I had more fun just hanging out after. I have a bruise on my arm from Mark and Alex picked my nose, but Its all good. Lance, Jessie, and I hung out after everyone left and we talked for like 2 hours. 

Thursday- I had orrientation at UNLV.....GAY! I just hope this is like the fastest 2 years of my life! I can't wait to go to seminary! The youth went to a 51's baseball game and it was pretty fun! We won so that made it even better. I found out some stuff at the game that made me sad, but its coolio! I spent the night at jessie's house again. I talked to Alex and Lance on the phone for awhile and then went to bed, but Jessie talked to Justin FOREVER! lol

Well as of Monday night guys still stink, but thanks to Justin I now realize its not all guys(lol). So ya anyways Mark, alex, Lance, and I all went over to Alyssa and Riana's house and watched a scary movie. I was so scared! I tried to stand the whole time cause I figured if I was the only one standing up I would be the first one out of the house if anything tried to get us, but I ended up sitting between Riana and Alex. After the movie I took Lance home and went to a party at Dominique's house. I didn't get home until like almost 3 am, but I got to see some friends I havn't seen since graduation.

Now I'm just chillin and babysitting waiting to go out tonight.

I leave next Wed. for GLORIETTA! I can't wait to get there although it is a 12 hour drive, but I don't care cause it's like Disney Land for Christians (lol The happiest place on earth). We get back on the 11th, but then i leave for Reno for the youth confrence on the 13th and come back on the 15th. So ya then I'm home for a week and then Britt, Erin, my family and I leave for Cali.

Tuesday I took Hannah to Mt. View one last time to say good-byr to Christina, Dallas, and Jason. She had fun but it was kind of sad....
Christina and all the interns got to break their fast, you could tell they were pretty excited! lol it was so funny

Friday we all had a big suprise going away/suprise party for Hannah. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN! A lot of people were there and i know Hannah had a good time. After Erin, Hannah, and I went to my sisters house to spend the night and Lance and Kenny came over at like 1:30am to go swimming.Hannah, Erin and I stayed up until like 3:30 watching scary movies, and my sister brother-in-law and noah came out to watch it w/ us. My sister and I were laughing at the movie cuase it was the 1984 Nighmare on elm street. Lol that movie is older then me and it was so fake. Ya then we went to bed and we got up at like 8 and then erin and i had to take her home so she could help pack the u-haul. Ya then Erin and I hung out for awhile and then my mom and i took her home. After that I had to go home and get ready for Lynsey's party. I had to go pick up Hannah and Britt and I was happy about that cause I only knew how to get to lynsey's from that side of town lol. So we dove all the way to ""china land"" lol as hannah would say and got lynsey's about an hour late. So ya we swam, ate (good food), and saw a ""rat""lol. I was so happy cause Erin called and said she could come to lynsey's party woohoo you know its a party when erin gets there. So ya we all hung out , but a couplde things bothered me but we won't go into that. Britt was cracking me up though! Then we left so I could take Hannah and Erin home. We followed the guys.....bad idea lol. So we took Erin home and then Hannah. When we got to Hannah's house britt, hannah, and I prayed for hannah and her family. I don't think I have ever cried so hard in my life. it didn't ht me until I started praying that she was actually leaving in 3 hours. So ya then I gave her a hug and finally let her go....it was hard cause i was thinking of all the times and memories we have had the past 2 and half years....
So ya Britt and I stayed the night at my sisters house and we stayed up forever talking about stuff. Then we went to church (great sermon by Pastor Stan), then we all went to the buffet at sunset station,and then went back to church. The band played for songfest and did pretty well, Erin sang and did amazing ( no suprise) she made me cry, and then Michelle Dodd's did a special sign language song for me for graduation I cried ( no suprise). 
I told Britt this was going to be a emotional week-end and it was:1. cause hannah left
2. cause guys are jerks aka ""jerkface"" 
3. cause my friends are great
4. cayse Gid rocks
5. cause graduation is coming up
So ya i guess i should go 
talk to ya later gator

Well I shouldn't say I did it, because it was totally God.
But I turned my feelings for someone over to God and I think I am finally over him. FINALLY!!!!
I  saw him the other day and I didn't melt the moment that he walked in the room. ok ok I know that sounded a little corny but what do you  exspect I am such a girl.lol
My heart doesn't ache anymore.
I made it through the hard times.
I don't feel like anything is missing anymore.
Things are all together great!
Through this crap that i basically put myself through God abled me to write a song  about it. And now I'm trying to minister to people that are going through the same thing I went through. But I'm thankful cause I did learn some things through this. I just feel retarded cause I was bitter about it there for awhile which is so D-U-M! lol 
A am so greatful because I can honestly say that I maybe all together over him. You know how a lot of the times people say that they are over the person but they will always have feelings for them.......I don't think that holds true for me. I could be wrong which I most likely am now that I think about it, but I hope I am right lol. So ya thats it, all guys are not jerks anymore and I'm just praying about my future husband. lol so ya......talk to ya later gator!

       What's up my hommie G funk dawg? Not much here just chillin. I havn't updated in a long while so I thiught I would give you a little keen insight on my so called life(did you ever watch that show? good stuff good stuff). So ya anyways.........

I don't know where to start 

Last week-end was the youths mountain retreat. It was coolio and fun and great and cold! I think everyone got a little closer which is tight and no drama which is great! Not as many people went as I had hoped but it was still coolio. P. Mike's sermons were great so ya I learned a lot.  We watched extreme days which totally made my night. LOL then Mark and I got in a ""fight"" and I won which wasn't  all together fair....... but I WON!lol

This past week has been ok. The senior class got in trouble because of our senior prank and our 2nd senior ditch day that we figured would maybe be ok to take (it wasn't) lol. So we have had senior meetings all week  which is coolio cause  I got out of government like 3 times this week. But ya we got our senior breakfast and off campus lunch taken away, but starting Monday some of us including myself get it back because we didn't participate in the senior prank or ditch day. 
 
Wed. night was coolio. I had a meeting w/ Pastor Mike to discuss the acountability groups I'm starting w/ the girls in youth. I've been really praying about this and It is something God has put on my heart in the past few moths so I know it will work. I just have some more praying to do about how I should come about it and what the study will be on. So if anyone has any ideas comment in my journal and let me know.

Today I picked Hannah  up from school and we went to go eat and hung out at my sisters house for awhile. Then we went to Alex's track meet. It was fun!  I  had no idea what was going on at first but I think we got the hang out it. LOL THANK GOD FOR SOFTBALL! So ya I think he  did well. He won the jump thing and came in second or third (something like that) in a running thing (lol like I said THANK GOD FOR SOFTBALL). So ya then Hannah and I left and drove around for awhile and then went to Holy Grounds (some ppl were being jerks). We met up w/ Andy there and talked for awhile .....mostly about old times. He talked me into going to Student week at Glorietta, but I'm still not sure if I want to go. But ya then we went to Starbucks (how ghetto are we? we went from holy grounds to starbucks right across the street) and sat and talked for awhile. Then I took Hannah and Andy home and now I'm at home updating my journal for you fine people. Well I should be going. Talk to ya later gator.

       I have refrained from writting in my journal for mainly 2 reasons. First I've thrown myself a little pitty party(lol), which is a result of reason number 2. I really won't get into reason number 2 but lets just put it this way...GUYS ARE JERKS! Now the thought of this concept makes me laugh because I'm always telling Mark that not ""all girls are jerks"", but the irony of it all is starting to make sense. For thoes of you who know me you might think  you know what I am talking about........... well you are only half right. The fact is GUYS ARE JERKS! 

        And while we are on that subject why is everyone cussing now? It is so flippant and banal . You can get your point across w/out using four letter words in fact how about becoming more scrupolous. So here is a  challenge, augment your vocab instead of using apathy as your excuse. Now this journal is not to exarbate the situation or even relegate you, but to be a didactic instruction.  THE POINT IS I'M SICK OF YOU GUYS CUSSING! I understand that it slips sometimes (and I too am guilty of the of the occasional ""word"") , but it has really gotten out of hand lately. So I'll make you a deal you stop cussing and I'll stop complaining. Sounds good right?
I guess I should go before I start in on something else (lol)
ok later gator

I can't wait till tomorrow! Tomorrow night is the true love waits conference and a lot of kids are going which is really exciting. I pray that lives are changed tomorrow night. God has really put it on my heart lately to reach all of these kids(thanks to the encouragment of Christina), so for that I am really blessed and thankful. So everyone pray for me cause I have a big job on my hands.

So ya i dunno what I will be doing on Saturday, but maybe chillin w/ Melissa, Colleen, and Dominique and have a girls night out. Or I might chill w/ hannah too, we will be single together (try and find the ironic oxymoron in that lol). So ya I'm thinking I'm not liking Valentine's Day. Shouldn't everyday be like V-Day if you have that special someone......??? something to think about
But since I don't blieve in love it doesn't matter anyways (lol right lance)

Well I should go...........
see ya later gator

ok so ya after finals I went and picked up Erin from school, but I was a little late.....sorry E-lo. Then we went to her house and chillied for awhile. After that we went to my sisters house so I could babysit Noah until my sister got home. We had fun there lol. I made pizza and I thought I was going to burn the house down....lol even though they were frozen pizzas and all you have to do is put them in the oven lol I don't cook. So ya Erin and I got online for awhile while Noah slept. We downloaded the milkhake song and some others but we couldn't find the song we wanted(gosh dang it.....I don't even know what the song is called lol). So ya while Erin and I looked for that dang song Alex called me. LOl he said something that cracked me up (something in french and spanish combined) and then Erin said something that made me laugh............lol i laughed so hard I fell out of my chair! lol I was like HAHAHAHA.....ummmmm ya... I think I broke my butt lol. 
So ya after that Erin and I got ready to go to church. We stopped at a store to get something to drink, and this 30 year old guy tried to pick up on Erin. He had the most retarded pick up line too. Erin was like ""ummm...I don't know you"" and he said ""well if I got your digits I might get to know you better"".............. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH sicko!!! lol then he tried to tell us he was only 19 i was like ""I DON'T THINK SO SICKO!"". lol so ya then we went to chruch tramatized .....so ya thats it lol

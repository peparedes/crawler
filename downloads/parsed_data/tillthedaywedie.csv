"event","Well, I just painted my room to two different shades of purple. I like it a lot but all I need now is new carpet. 

(I am so bored right now)

I am going up north to Traverse City with Amie, my Aunt and Uncle and Veronica. Gretta too. We should have fun. 

I can honestly say that I want to go back to school so bad right now. I am bored every single day. There is nothing to do around here, and if there is, you have to pay for it all. I could go sit at Boaders all day long (no joke) but no one wants to do that. And I can't drive yet so that doesn't help.

I really want to go see DMB at the Golden Gate Park in San Fransisco. But yeah right...

I got the Ashlee Simpson CD on Tuesday. I actually really like it. The songs kind of get slower and slower as the CD goes on, so yeah. 

I really want my own digital camera and a computer, since my mom gets pissed when I go on hers. I just...I don't know...what to be out of high school and in my 20's. It just says ""FREEDOM!"" 

Well, I'm off to finish painting my room. I have to do where the tape is. (I'm really sick of painting now.

Cheers :)

Me and Jessica still have to work on our project for w/s. (I'm so dumb, I can't believe I did that) Well, John Mayer tickets go on sale tomorrow, and SINCE I have to work at 10:00, I can't get his tickets. I don't want to sit on the lawn because when I went last year, all I did was look at the effing screen the whole time and it seemed like it only lasted a 1/2 hour. Oh well, I still want to go. I HAVEN'T HUNG OUT WITH AMIE IN SO LONG. (Beside the two concerts) It just sucks because she is the only person that I ever hang out with, and I don't anymore because she's got a boyfriend now. I was looking forward to her staying the night on Tuesday and Wednesday but she couldn't. I just sucks to know that when you really only have one friend, you can't hang out with them anymore because of a guy. Oh well. If she wants to hang out with me, she'll call me right? Well, It's time for me to hit the mattress. I've gotta get up at 8ish. I'm outa here. Bye!

Tomorrow as you all know is easter...not such a big day for me...just time to see them fam. I am thinking about taking a photography class but I can't find one around here. The only one that I found was on 8 mile road, and that is really far. I wouldn't go down there anyway. I want to see if they have a class at OCC. Hopefully I can take a class there. Maybe I will call there right now and see if they have anything. I'm tired. I think I'll just eat dinner and watch like 10 movies tonight and not do a thing. goodnight

I've never cried so much in a movie either. I'm starting to understand everything now. My view on all of this is so much...better. I feel like people might look at things differently now, along with myself. I just feel so thankful, after watching that.

Hello Everyone!

Today was splended. I love red days...I love the color day but not the fact we have school ya know?

Well I talked to Brittany yesterday. I hope things get better for her, but in the mean time...she just have to figure things out for herself. I just hope that people can see what an awesome person she can be. Because really...only Blair and I see it. It sucks. But thats her decision. 

I have this thing to go to tomorrow after school. It's this teen court thing. We get to take part in real court situations, dealing with teens. It's going to be so cool. I'll get some new experiences. (I want to be part of the jury)

I watched a bunch of TV tonight. Gilmore Girls, One Tree Hill, (I still need to see American Idol because I taped it) and The Real World. Not much of what I thought they were going to be like. But Blair and I have a little big of bonding time! Thats always good. 

I still need to convince my mom that I really want her to go to DMB show with me in OHIO! I want to go so bad...they go on sale on Thursday. 

Well I think I'll get going to bed. I will talk to you all soon. Au Revoir, Mon Ami!

Cheers!

"event","Hi. Well..Yes, like I said, this week has gone by very slow for me. It kinda sucks. Well tomorrow is friday. YAY I am working at the tanning salon every saturday now! MONEY! Val, Becca, Blair, Jeremy and me all went to the mall today. I bought the Norah Jones cd. It's really good, except there is a song with Dolly Parton on it...yuck. 

     Brittany wrote me a letter today appoligizing to me. (SP) I just don't understand why she didn't say anything to Blair. She treated her and I the same exact way, except I asked her what was wrong. I'm really glad that she said something (a lot) but  I can't deal with all of her mood swings anymore. It's getting to the point where when she has them, it makes me just say ""forget this!"" She told me she was going to change her attitude and be ""civil, nice and happy"" but I guess not. She always says that she wants friends but I dont understand how she can make new friends when she isn't...whats the word??? I don't know...ummm open and talkitive to people. When someone says ""Hi"" to her she just gives them dirty looks and turns away. She needs to open up more. People are missing out on who she really is, and if she would show it, I think more people would like her and WANT to be frieds with her. I just dont understand her sometimes. 

    Well...those are my thoughts on things. I'm going to go do some francais homework. Talk to ya! bye!

  When they took him away for him to get his ingection (to put him down) my mom, aaron and I coudn't stand it anymore. I hated to see my mom cry like that. She misses him so much. Everytime I look at a picture, I start to cry. But it's all just a matter of time. We are all here for eachother. I just wish that I could've spent ONE MORE DAY with him, but that wouldn't be enough. I just can't believe that he is gone. We are burring him today after school. He is in his cascut, (in heaven actually) but when Aaron gets done working we are going to go waaayyy back in my back yard in put him there. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH DEXT!

It's just going to leave a big empty hole inside me. I just need to be happy that he is leaving us happy and not suffering. My mom is going to hold him in her arms while he is passing away, and I will be in there too. I just can't believe he isn't going to be around anymore. Well, Dexter...I will ALWAYS love you with all of my heart and I will always miss you and cherish the times we had. I love you.

I really want to continue playing but it SUCKS trying to practice and get up to the level that everyone wants you to be at. I was going to go to S&E this year but I guess not because I wasn't practicing my piece. It's really frusterating trying to practice. (You would think I wouldn't know because I dont practice, but...c'est vrai!) I'm not quitting though. I need to practice NOW and make not only everyone else happy but I need to make myself happy. 

                          i want someone to cuddle with
   My math grade sucks. I failed my first semester. I'm in Mrs. Lane's Class now, but I'm not sure if that will help...only because I can ask her for help but...she grades differently and no matter how SMART you are, you still get a D or fail. I DISLIKE (not hate) my school.

   That is another thing. I always say ""I hate"" when I really just ""dis-like"" something. I need to stop saying that. My friends and family ALWAYS make fun of me when I say that. I need to stop. 

  Well, I'm about to get ready to go over my aunts house for a family dinner thing. I will be back tonight or tomorrow! xo

"event","I didn't have any other title but that one. I just got done watching the Incubus dvd. It's awesome. They did a really good proformance. I think I'm going sledding tomorrow. Hopefully I wont get hurt again for the 3rd time. That would suck. John Mayer and Guster are coming to town together but my momma-sita wont let me go, which i'm mad about but I can understand because it's on a school nite. Whatever tho. He will be back in the summer time and I'll go see him then. But I'm really in the mood to go to a concert right this second. I dont really care who for but I just want to go. 311 would be good, they could really wake me up...along with NICK HEXUM! HAHA He is so frickin cute! I can't stand it. Well I think I'm gonna go to bed and hopefully not wake up to late tomorrow morning. I gotta get up around 11 to go sledding. I'll talk to you tomorrow, Live Journal.

"event","I am still in my PJ's and it's almost 7:00 at night. It's a bit rediculous. Well, last night was fun but Amie ended up leaving a bit early today. Brittany Blair and I went to Drayton and played UNO and ate breakfast. It was good. MMMHMM

I talked to Kristin's mom again today. Someone decided instead of slashing 2 tires, this time it's gonna be 8!!!! These people are rediculous, and I know it's that fucking ass hole Brandon Peoples. Along with his gf Amanda Bolton. But I've thought to myself, some how it got around that Kristin is in rehab and they said ""Kristin's mom....what a bitch"" so they decided to do that. I'm so sick of this shit. I just want Kristin to get better, and thats all i'm worried about. I hate people. 

I've thought to myself, I don't want to stay here anymore. I want to leave and go somewhere else with total different surroundings. Different people, places things to do. I want to make new friends. I dont have any here, so I want to go somewhere else and start over. with amie. Amie is my best friend and I love her so much and I don't know what to do without her. Shes always been there for me when I <-- need someone to talk to. (Seeing that I tell everyone else what they should do and it's not good enough) And to be honest, I feel like being a whole other person right now. I want to be 18 so I can drive...and take my mom with me of course. haha! I love you mom! 

Cheers!

"event","Well...I'm hanging out with Amie, and we are watching sad movies...Uptown Girls and Life as a House. We were going to watch Cabin Fever, but we don't feel like being scared. Well Blair Jeremy Erika and I went to the movies today and saw Along Came Polly. It was a really good movie. Then after that we came back and got Amie and we went to Best Buy. I got Jason Mraz (again, I lost it) Linkin Park Live in Texas, Maroon 5 and THE BEASTIE BOYS. Hell yeah! HAHAHA Well, I'm glad that Erika and I are getting along now. Thats a plus. AMIE IS COMING TO FUCKING FLORIDA WITH ME!! YAY!!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO GO! I'm going to NYC in March, then FL and I was soposed to go to France but I guess not. Not enough money and I dont want to go alone. Well, thats okay, Blair and I can go together when we are older. Well, I'm gonna go, and watch some more movies. I'll be back tomorrow! ONLY SATURDAY!

"event","I've realized that there are some qualities about myself that I need to change...soon. Because if they done change, I'm taking a risk of losing a/some friend(s). All I need to say about that is my mouth. I've never heard more things come out of anyones mouth than mine. I'm to the point now, that I dont even know what to say, think or do anymore. I'm so sick of thinking about stupid shit. It's a waste of time. But a lot of it isn't stupid. I just don't know. And Erika was telling me it sounded like I want to live up to my sister, and I DON'T. I really honestly don't. I just want people to be able to trust me as much as they trust her with things. And that is going to be hard, but it's true. 

   I saw Kristin today, and I went with her to rehab. I really hope that she realizes that she CAN change her ways. She is so fucking smart, and it hurts me so much to know that she is throwing that all away right now. I hope she can pick herself up soon before this situation gets really bad. I hope this place works for her. I really do. I love her so much and I don't know how many times I've said that but I honestly do, and I don't want anything to happen to her. I love you Kristin.

"event","WoW! Today was interesting. Went to Drayton and then went to Brittanys house...well we ended up going sledding kinda in her back yard but kinda not. It's actually a long walk but its near her house. Anyway...It took us about 30 minutes at the most to walk there, and then we got the the HUGE hill...and let me tell you, I DID NOT want to walk up that hill and keep falling down. Well Amie and Brittany talked me into it, so I got up there and I decided to go on a steeper hill then the one I thought I was gonna go on, so I was on my way down...I did about 5 summer-sults, my head was DIGGING into the ground the whole way down and I got up and I was PISSED because my head hurt so damn bad...well I stood up and I looked at both of them, and they were LAUGHING THEIR ASSES OFF, but when they took a really good look at me, Amie saw a HUGE ASS bump on my head...I mean huge like a golf ball, but more wide. It HURT SO BAD. So we went home to brittanys house,which took about an hour to get home because it had snowed more and I looked at it and went ""OH MY GOSH!!!!!!! ITS GINORMOUS!"" hahaha so my mom came and got me and we went to the emergency place and they took care of it. So I guess I'm fine...I just need to keep putting ice on and but there will be a bad bruise. (sp) But anyway, that was my half day for ya! HAHAHA what a blast. Hopefully we have no school tomorrow! YAY! I'm not gonna get to excited though. Talk to you later. ::Much Love:: KARA"

"event","Geez. What a day. I need to study and i'm so tired. Well Kristin is getting released tomorrow. They don't know where she is going yet. I dont think. I should call Michelle but I don't feel like it. I'm so sick of thinking about it and so sick of crying. I just want her to know that I love her so much and I want to be there for her but she wont let me, or anyone else for that matter. I want everything to be how it was. I guess I just miss it. 

          Everything I Love....

I Love...When my sister and I are really close and we can talk about anything and everything without fighting.

I Love...My Mom
      ...My friends
      ...The feeling of summer time
      ...When I'm in my room and It is silent. 
      ...Dave Matthews Band
      ...When I'm not in an argument with ANYONE
      ...When I'm positive about everything

         Everything I Hate...

I Hate...When I can't understand anything
      ...When my friends are mad at me and I dont really know why
      ...When my sister acts differently around other people ( I like the way she is when she is with me)
      ...When my sister starts hanging out with my friends that she barely used to talk to
      ...School
      ...I hate when I feel dissappointed in MYSELF

        One more thing I need to say...

    My sister said SOMETHING like this the other day....
""Maybe you chould change some things about yourself and they way you are with other people.""

  Well Blair, I'm sorry. I know that I've done some things wrong dealing with my friendships with some people, and I'd like to change that. But the thing I'M NOT CHANGING is who I am. That is so important to me, and I dont want it to change at all. I am who I am and no one can fix that. 

Cheers and Much Love....

"event","I HATE mondays. Today was the worst of the worst. So i'm in the car this morning and my contact fell out and I couldn't but it back in because it dried out. So I got to school, and tried to clean it with water, but that didn't work so I thru it away. I went into 1st block (science) and I sat down (only seeing out of one eye) and Erika is totally ignoring Amie and me. So, Amie finally says ""Are you mad at me Erika?"" and Erika said ""Oh no! I'm not mad at you, not at all."" Which that is what I dont understand beacuse justine told me that Erika was walking down the hall w/ Justine and she said ""Ugh, I hate amie."" but for some reason shes not mad at her now?? What the hell...but whatever. Then I get to my 5th hour...I got a HUGE review sheet that is only worth 5 pts! It's rediculous. Then, I only finished the vocab. So I go to lunch to fill out a request to talk to mrs stag, and she didn't send me a pass. So I was about to do my paper that I always do in math class BUT I couldn't see the overhead! So didn't get that done. Then, he tells me that our test is on the overhead too! So thats my day for ya! I hate school. But I'm going over Jeremy's house right now so I will be back later. I LOVE MY SISTER SO MUCH! Thanks for everything you said! I love you more than you know! ::Much Love:: Karebear"

I wish everyone knew what the hell I'm talking about and I wish parents weren't so stupid and ignorant but that's the way life is sometimes. I fell so lost and it's to the point where I dont even know what to think anymore and it sucks. You might not even know what i'm talking about but I guess all ya know is MY LIFE SUCKS RIGHT NOW! And shoot! I've got mid-terms this week that I have to study my ass off for. A bunch of projects to do this weekend. A math test on monday before my actual final. I hate school. That's all I have to say about that. So, Amie and I are starting this Live Journal. I love Amie so much and I honestly don't know what I would do without her.

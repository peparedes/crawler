The following entires are pointless ramblings such as snorting drugs in bathroom stalls, whining endlessly about my lonliness and depression and my experience in practicing self inflicted violence made by a shy insecure sensitive suicidal drug addicted 15 year old emo kid. If you don't care then be on your way and if you think you do care, you probably don't.

Love, Desiree'"

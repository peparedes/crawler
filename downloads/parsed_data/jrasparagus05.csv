"event","I know they say you can never go home again, but I'm not so sure that's true. I think, more accurately, some people can, but others really just don't want to, and should never want to. I'm cleaning my apartment-- the one that I lived in for three years-- that has been sitting untouched for over a year. Everything is just the way I left it, and it's full of things I never wanted to see again. Letters from former friends, images of old loves, reminders of bad decisions. A lot of good happened there, yes. Somehow, those memories never float to the top anymore. I usually remember the awesome times first. Now I look at the shelves, the pictures, the dust and wish I had a garbage bag big enough to dispose of those memories. Sigh."

"event","Hey guys,

So... I'm a space cadet that forgot to get the straps on my dress for graduation shortened. I just realized this morning. Does anyone know of a tailor (or a friend with a sewing machine) that can do it same-day? My sewing machine is far away. Comment here or e-mail: LaurenElana@gmail.com.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

"event","My parents renewed their vows last year and I have finally talked my mother into getting rid of some of the unused stuff from the ceremony. We have a TON of luminary bases, bags and inserts for candles that I will give away free to anyone who wants them. I know weddings are expensive and stuff like this can run a ton of money. So, if you want them, the only catch is you have to come to Celebration (my parents' house) to get them. They are cream colored bags and the inserts look like doves when you light the candle inside. Drop me an IM (DaysGoBySooFast) or email (LaurenElana@gmail.com) if you want them.

Also <lj-cut text=""Anyone want a puppy?"">

My dog had puppies not too long ago (unexpected pregnancy RIGHT before she was set to get spayed...) and I fell in love with one of the puppies so much that I was dragging my feet about finding her a home. Now I'm moving into a new house and don't think the landlord would be okay with her AND my other dogs. Anyway, she's a long-haired chihuahua and the product of the two sweetest chihuahuas in the world (but I might be biased). Her name is Chester (long story) and she is about 12-weeks old. She needs her last set of shots still, but she is set to get them on Tuesday. There are pictures of her below and you are more than welcome to come get her. All of her siblings went for $400. Again drop me an IM (DaysGoBySooFast) or email (LaurenElana@gmail.com) if you have any questions about her. It breaks my heart to see her go. :( She is the best cuddler in the world. <3

"event","Hi,

I live in a house 4/2.5 house out in Waterford Lakes. Our fourth roommate for when we resign our lease fell through, so we're looking for a fourth. We're two females and a male, pretty laid back and we get along really well. We don't really have rules, but we are pretty clean and like to keep it that way. We have three chihuahuas that are really friendly and trained, but they do have their moments. We try to keep them as much in control as possible. I don't think our landlord would allow any other dogs, but small animals are probably okay. Rent is $500 a month and it includes all utilities. We would prefer a female, but will consider males too. You would be sharing a bathroom with two other people. You can email me with questions at LaurenElana@gmail.com or IM at JrAsparagus05.

Thanks,

Lauren"

I have a hot pink iPod Shuffle for sale. I bought it almost a year ago and have used it twice. I have no idea what happened to the ear phones. Make me an offer?

Also, I have a brand new printer that has been used once that I want to sell. I got it last week and it's in perfect condition, but my brother told me after the fact that he has one that I can have. I only used it for black and white printing so the cartridges are basically full. It's a Cannon. I paid $50. Again, make me an offer.

"event","I'm getting the restless, gotta move feeling again that I had a few years ago. Only now, it doesn't scare me. I have successfully moved out of my house and begun the whole living on my own thing, I could do the same elsewhere. 

If I didn't have an internship that meant a lot to me and a least to complete, I would hit the road tomorrow. Usually I don't have an idea of where I would like to end up, but this time, I have my sights set on a certain place with a certain motive and I'm ready to get out of here as soon as possible.

Even though college is the best thing that has ever happened to me, there is a huge part of me that would love to forego it for a bit and get out of dodge. Or transfer elsewhere and leave everything and anything behind. Just leave without notification, pomp and circumstance or goodbyes. 

I just want out. 

I don't feel the inseperable bond between my parents and I like I used to. Don't get me wrong, I love them for everything they are and are not and they are the most important people in the world to me, but I have reached that point in my life where I am capable of surviving without them. I am capable of surviving without anyone, at this point. My independence might have gotten to the point of ""out-of-control,"" honestly, because the idea of staying here with people I know and who can give me a hand when I need it is utterly stifling. I thought moving out would be a good start to getting rid of the pressure that I feel surrounds me all the time, but for some reason, I don't feel like I'm far enough away.

I know I go through this phase all the time, but this time it feels different. This time, it's not about being bored or misunderstood or whatever angsty reason I had to the way I felt in the past. This time, I'm filled with this total sense of anger and hate for everyone I know. Well, not everyone. But I have just gotten so jaded toward this idea of getting old, growing up and being an adult. While the job part doesn't bother me, the people that are chasing this golden idea that they are going to be together with someone forever are making me effing nauseated. I'm so tired of it. I have gotten to that point where I don't believe love actually exists anymore and I need to get away from this atmosphere where everyone my age settles down forever with the first person they meet in college. I can't handle it anymore. People get divorced all the time because they're young and stupied when they get married the first time. If you're not smart enough or old enough to have a college degree yet, you shouldn't be allowed to get engaged, married or be dumb enough to think that you have found forever. No one knows what forever is. Or what the future holds. And that dumb boy that is holding your hand today is likely to dump you tomorrow. The airheaded bimbo you spent yesterday with might make it a year, but she'll probably make a drunken mistake at some point and break your forever. Sorry.

I know I'm jaded and I have lots of reasons to be angry at this whole notion. I am just so over my friends that ""can't"" because the guy that is going to dump them next week or that they aren't ready or capable of being in a relationship with is coming over and they have to spend time with him. I know I have been guilty of it before, but I look back on that and see how truly ridiculous I was. 

The sad thing is, is that whatever this feeling is, has totally eroded my faith in friends, even. I know there are those that will always be around and I love them. But even they are bound to flake when the boyfriend or girlfriend gets in the way and honestly, I expect it. In fact, the first time I hear ""boyfriend"" out of the mouth of a friend when it's time to make plans, I usually call someone else or just watch movies on the couch. I was in a relationship for two years where I was always the second option, I'm certainly not going to entertain that idea in my friends. 

This isn't a jealousy thing, by the way. I'm not just upset that they have someone and I don't. I don't want anyone. The few times that it has come up in the past year, I have chosen for not. I'm single by choice and that's exactly the way I want it. This idea of love and happiness doesn't seem logical at all to me. I live on reason and logic and putting your everything in trusting someone who is never going to live up to your expectation strikes me as one of the dumbest systems in the world. Marriage is a financial contract, something that makes it easier to survive because you have a second set of hands to run the farm and milk the cows. Love never factored in, except in Jane Austen books and the occasional poor person that didn't have enough of a dowry to worth anything. They married for love. Everyone else in the world, a hundred years ago, actually understood what this entire system was about. Work, procreation and death. Seems like a much more intelligent cycle then the bullshit system we have in place now. 

Keep the L-word as far away from me as possible because I an neither interested nor looking. It ends up in confusion, hurt and ridiculous wastes of energy. I have better things to concentrate on.

Oh, and if you are dumb enough to be involved? Keep that away from me too. You know I have trouble keeping my mouth shut and I am likely to tell you what I really think of your ""perfect relationship.""

Oh wait, I already did.

</Angry Rant>

Whoo. I feel better now. 

P.S. I want to move to Boston. And I am really planning it as soon as I can.

P.P.S. I'm going to be an Aunt. Samira is pregnant. <---- Babies/children/family? The only love that actually exists."

"event","They say you can never go home again. I have felt this truth in this recently. I went home to Louisiana for a few days for my brother's graduation. Though I hadn't been there in several years, I was so shocked to see the extreme changes, everywhere. I seemed like when I lived there, everything remained the same, but the moment I left, the wheels of progress began to spin. It's was nothing short of crazy and surreal the expect the home I once lived in and totally get another place. There was something different on every corner.

The only reason I really mention this is because I have never left what I now consider to be such a large part of my home,  only to find that there really is not a place for me, anyway. The general hostility that I feel within it is so unsetling. I feel like I lived there, thrived there, learned to breathe and create there, only to have one seemingly disgruntled human being remove it all from my grasp. I know it's part of growing up, but this isn't a situation where I grew out of something. There is so much room for growth within, but I feel lately that they have made the decision that the possible responsibility is not something they're interested in. I'm still welcomed and imagined to be part of the whole, but in reality, I've become a seperate entity, sitting off the the side. Had the seperation been by choice, a deliberate decision made because I felt it was time to seperate and move on, I would leave cherishing good memories and feeling as if the foundation of my passion came from the participation within such an organization. I guess all good things have to come to an end and every era of comes to a close, it just hurts so much to know that someone I cherished as a friend could become something so angry and removed from his former self. I know where it started and I can trace the path he took to becoming this person, as well as the catalyst to the feelings that he holds against me. He has taken something totally unrelated into his own life and decided that he has to weather to storm alongside, thus injuring what relationship we used to have. I wish someone would stop him and finally let him know what he really has invested himself into, what it's really like and all of the things he isn't seeing. The truth though, is that I highly doubt it would change anything. He has decided to forfeit everything for it and that's just a choice that I have to get over. In the end, I think I just feel betrayed. I had a friend taken away a replaced with a miserable and atrocious replacement. Someone that isn't even really worth writing this entry over. But, the friend I used to have was worth a million heartfelt journal entries. Consider this in his memory.

Everything is hectic, to say the least. I got new furniture last week that doesn't really fit so I'm trying to send it back, but in the process my room is in total dissaray. We all know how much Lauren hates chaos. On top of that, we had a pipe burst in the wall between my Dad's office and my bathroom, so a large portion of the house flooded, including my closet. The contents of my closet are now ontop of the previously mentioned chaos. Insanity.

Dad's going in for a pacemaker on the 30th. We've made it almost a year without a trip to the  hospital, I guess it's time to go back. So frustrating.

Other things in my life are frustrating and upsetting, but there's not much I can do about them. I just have to sit back and let them happen. I've tried to put my two cents in and make an impact, but to no avail. I have to rely on the idea that everything works out for the best, as much as I hate it. 

I may be moving. Washington D.C., possibly. Josh is going to Georgetown Law and would like me to go with him. I wouldn't mind moving. Well, I would hate it and it would depress me and give me panic attacks, but it would all be for the better. Who knows. Maybe I'll end up somewhere else. The future is kind of a big question mark. For some, that's exciting. For me, I'm miserable.

Overall, at the moment, things are ok. Not horrible. I know I sound upset and depressed, but I'm not. I'm just in a funk. I have way too much on my mind and entirely too many things to deal with in the coming days, weeks and months. But, all things considered, for the current state of things, I can deal with it. It'll all be a'ok, eventually.

I have to let go of the idea that my concept of the future is the way things need to work out. There is a bigger plan then I could possibly conceive and I need to let go and let it happen. Yeah, right. It'll be a cold day in hell before I let go of anything.

I'm here for most of the summer. Hopefully taking a trip to New York for the first time in almost 15 years. This theatre dork has never been to Broadway. So, yeah. I just wanna go. Now-ish.  And I gotta get away for a while.

Abso-freaking-lutely amazing. 

We had been planning to go to Disney for quite a while.  Josh has been in town since Wednesday and it has been absolutely awesome. He is so much fun to spend time with and the constant one-up-manship is just hilarious.  All of my sibilings and I have gotten along in every circumstance and it has basically been harmonious in the Erlich house recently.  

After we went to lunch, Leanne came over to tell me about the new boy. GREAT story! Teehee. Then, my parents invited her to go to Disney with us. My Dad's birthday is this week and he loves the Chinese restaurant at Epcot more than anything. My parents, Leanne, Josh, David, Courtney and I all went at around 6:30.  Once we got there, we took our tradition walk around to all of the different pavilions. The twist on it this time was that Leanne and I spoke in the accents of whatever country we were in at the time. It was so much fun. We took my Dad to the French pavilion so he could stand in ""his"" spot.  There is one place in the French Pavilion that he absolutely loves and wants to get an office right about it to do all of his work. We continued on, being idiots all the way. Leanne and I skipped through the tourists, were loud and obnoxious, danced in the middle of the streets and acted like morons the entire time. My Mom asked me if Leanne and I are always gay when we go to Disney (in references to the rampant ass slapping and cheek kissing) to which I responded ""WHY, OF COURSE! It's Disney!"" Slowly it started to get darker and as the lights went out, I hung back to hang onto my Dad cause Epcot is really freaking dark at night. We then went to Dinner where we had the best freaking Chinese food ever and a rather impressive waitress that, thought English isn't her native language, managed to keep up with our insanity the entire time. I was highly impressed. We laughed the entire time, shared food, had a bit of everything and had so much fun. The meal ended with a birthday cake for my dad (that he couldn't eat, of course) and some more laughter by all.

The best part was when we left the restaurant. Our reservation wasn't until 8:45 so when we left, there was almost no one in the park. Like, maybe twenty people. It was dark, but the walk  back to the entry way wasn't long. Leanne, Courtney and I started the insanity by taking off our flip-flops, throwing them at the boys and skipping a majority of the way back. Then, Leanne and I fluttered around like crazy, danced to the different musics in the remaining pavilions, made Mexican jokes in the Mexican pavilion. Eventually, I jumped on Leanne's back and we ran half of the way back to the entrance.  That was crazy fun. Jokes were made, we laughed really hard and were absolutely insane. As we go to the exit, there was a wheelchair that someone had left. My Dad looked at it, exhausted, and sat down and David started to push him back the car (after we made jokes about missing cripples, of course). Next, we found an empty stroller, which Leanne hopped into and I ran behind it, pushing it as fast as I could. We then got a genius idea. Courtney was pushing my Dad by then and I had Leanne in the stroller.... RACE!!!! We raced all the way up to the fountain at the very front before David took over for me and I hung back with my Mom and Josh.  Josh then proceeded to pick my mom up and try and throw her in the fountain (for good luck). Finally, we got back to the car (after a litany of gay jokes) and our sides were hurting so badly from laughing the entire time. I was absoltely insane and the most fun I've ever had in my life. Leanne fits in with my family so well, you can't tell that she wasn't born into it. Courtney is such an absolute sweetheart and I love her like a sister.  My Dad said it was the best birthday he's ever had.

I love my family. I acted like a total idiot all night to zero judgement, expectation or anything other than laughter and support. While that shouldn't seem like a big deal, it is to me. If anyone questions my decision to stay home, close by, near that hilarious, sweet, wonderful, insane, caring, loving, kind, ridiculous and absolutely unique people, than you don't understand how important they are to me and what I would do for them. What I have, I couldn't get anywhere else and I wouldn't give up these moments for the world. 

On another note, I had the sweetest little old man and woman come into work this morning. They made my heart melt. He came in and ordered and was so meek and mild and adorable. I think he had a stroke at one point, because he can't open his eye on one side and that same side is drastically lower than that other. I helped him all that I could and told him to go relax and I would bring everything out to he and his wife.  He went to walk out, turned around, reached into his pocket and slowly stuck a dollar into the tip jar. I almost cried. He was so sweet. And his wife thanked me about a million times for bringing the food out the them. She reminded me of Ms. Clara from ""To Wong Foo...""

Today was so incredible."

Life is still... insane. But getting less so. Sunday night was hard. I know not to make that mistake again.

I've been getting these headaches that make it impossible to function. They start between my eyes and spread in a line up to the center of my forehead and across the my temples.  I get dizzy when I move my head and always feel like I'm going to throw up. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, others, I can't stand up. I've kept the leaving of my house minimal because I shouldn't be driving. When they decide to hit, I basically lose the ability of rational thought because they hurt so  badly. Rather than having this occur in a car, I just stay home or have someone else drive me. The only place I've driven of any distance is school and I could drive there in my sleep. What sucks most about them is that sometimes, they don't even hurt, it's just a miserable feeling and I can't stand for very long. On Sunday I had this huge list of things to do and as soon as I started to do them, I had to lay down because of my head. I fell asleep for like three hours and woke up to little relief. I took a long shower and some of my mom's medicine for headaches that are almost the same... nothing. Nothing fixed them. I'm waiting on a prescription for something stronger. I need to get back to work. I haven't been to Lake Highland in what feels like a million years. They're going to think I've abandoned them. I haven't, I swear. I had to go home from work on Monday and I basically lived in the back on Wednesday. 

My Speech class was cancelled today and all I really had to do was a test in my music class, so I asked Meghan to sign me into Sociology and all I was going to do was take my music test. I drove the 45 minutes to school (a drive I don't really mind) and studied as much as I could. I didn't think I was going to do particularly well, but she drops one of the three tests and this is our third. I'm ok with my other scores, no biggie. We get there, she hands out the test, I have my scantrons ready and, when one girls says she's missing pages, the professor asks us to check and see if anything is missing from our tests. ALL of them were missing pages. Reschedule! So, I drove all the way out there for nothing. Oh well, I came home and spent time with my mom and then got hit in the eyes with another headache after lunch. :( Sucks so much. My bed and I have gotten well-reacquainted lately, so that's a plus. Luckily, I have the best job in the world so being sick isn't an issue. Two of the best jobs, actually. I love my Highlanders. 

I came to this huge conclusion the other day that is a bigger deal than most would assume. I miss my brother. I miss him so much. I hate that he doesn't live with me anymore. Now, granted, if I lived with him I'd probably want to kill him, but I totally wish he was here right now. He is my voice of reason. I don't always listen and sometimes he's wrong, but more often than not, he's right (Don't tell him I said that!). My mom told me he's coming to visit in a few weeks and I got so excited. Last time he was here, he was absolutely awesome to be around and so much fun. We danced at my parent's party, he strong armed Spencer, he made jokes and was the best big brother I could ask for. All of my brothers have grown up so much recently, it's so awesome.

My family is the best I could ever ask for. I never question why I stayed home. Now, the question of moving in with my brother wherever he decides to go to law school has arisen... and this is a different matter. 

Anywho, call me sometime if we haven't talked recently. I'm sure I miss you."

Still climbing though. Back up to the top."

Man, where does the time go? I feel like yesterday I was sitting in a hotel room in Tampa, giddy over my new boyfriend. That was 11 months ago. 10 months ago he took me to prom. 9 I graduated high school. It's almost a year since I've been out of school. How insane is that? My semester off flew by at warp speed. I feel much better now that I'm accomplishing  things again, but I loved being a bum. We really never do stop to look around, though. The world just passes by. I try not to get so caught up in work that I forget about the little things. Like the little girl 4-year-old girl at work today who's mom made her order her cookie all by herself. Then, she came in a little later with a dollar and said ""My Mom said because you got us three coffees and cookies so I should give you this as a tip."" I said ""Thank you very much"" and she looked at me and said ""Have a nice day!"" And ran out. She made my heart melt. 

It's the little things, it really is.

Oh, we got hamsters. Their names are peanut butter clusterfuck and jelley buttfore. Clusterfuck,  because I wanted to name my hamster clusterfuck... peanur butter and jelly because we wanted to hold them and sing ""It's peanut butter jelly time, it's peanut butter jelly time!""

The silliest thing ever happened and it made me smile more.

I was walking between classes, going from Communications to Classroom and I dropped my sweater. This guy stopped walking to pick it up and hand it to me, even though I was already reaching to get it. He got there first, I said ""Thanks"" and he said ""You're Welcome.""

It was really, really nice and totally unexpected. I guess I'm used to high school where if you dropped something most guys (with some exception) would walk over it rather than give you a hand. It just caught me off guard and made me happy that the people walking around me are actually genuinely nice, not jackasses and sketchy people.

Ok, so it's my first Valentines Day with a Valentine and I am majorly excited. I've gone all out on several levels, and I think it's cute. :) Yesterday afternoon, I baked heart shaped cookies and hand-dipped half of them in chocolate sauce that I made and covered the other half in pink frosting. I decorated some of them. I took one and wrapped it up in saran wrap and took the rest and put them on a plate and covered it with saran wrap. I took one of the cards I got him, signed it with a cute little note and put the wrapped up cookie inside the envelope. I'll tell you what the card said later. 

I ran the plate of cookies over to Barbara's house last night. The envelope with the cookie was deposited on his windshield early this morning before I left for school. The plate of cookies that I gave to Barbara were waiting for him when he got to her class today. :) It made me happy.

We're going on a picnic by the lake tonight and we're just going to chill and spend time with each other... something we haven't done since theatre was invented. I have more surprises for later, which I will tell you about then, in the event he reads it.

Oh, and the best part? The card. On the outside it has a baby in a bathtub with a rubber ducky in his mouth and it says ""Be my Valentine &hearts; "" On the inside it says:

"event","So, I'm sitting at a debate tournament, not judging. I have entirely too many kids in the tournament to be useful for anything. The only thing I've judged all day is one round of group interp that Ms. Butrimas asked me to pick up and then give feedback on it. No big deal, I don't mind. The kids were cute and I like feeling like someone respects my opinion. Hah. The debate circuit is really the only place where I feel even remotely like that. 

For being someone with a moderately reliable knowledge base, I don't get used very often. I never judge at these things, Highland always has too many kids entered. Either way, I sit around and schmooze with team Moms and other coaches and remember that the people that do this stuff really aren't bad, it was just the competing part that I hated.

The Trinity coaching staff still feels like home to me, hah. They have known me since I was a dweeby little thirteen year old. Now I'm a dweeby little nineteen year old that is still hanging around. I guess I'll always have a place to go, as long as it's on the Central Florida Debate circuit. I can't decide whether that's sad or not.

Last night ""Our Town"" went up. It was really, really good. With the lights and everything, it really was incredible. I was impressed. I love Dale and I love spending time with those people. Jeremy is one of the funniest people in the entire world. I swear to Bob he had us laughing so hard. We made so many ""Ooops, I crapped my pants"" references. Holy wow, so funny. It's a group of people that I totally enjoy and they don't seem to mind when I hang around. Christine and I have gotten to be really good friends recently. She kept asking me to go to rehearsals and come hang out with her and stuff. She makes me smile, lol. And, as usual, getting to see Spence on stage is always nice. Sigh, it's tough to have the most talented actor on the block as a boyfriend. Alright, no it isn't. He's just so darn cute.

Boyfriend moment over.

Anyway, I've been hanging around this tournament all day, doing nothing except talking to the Mom's and Sam Weitzner, who is a really funny individual. We spent the entire Celebration CFL sitting around and bitching about everything under the sun, but he's doing ballot check in so he has to look somewhat official. I, on the other hand, get to sit on the computer all day, updating various journals and being a total idiot. Wahoo.

This post makes zero sense, I am just totally and completely bored.

I was ready the novelization of that Cameron Diaz movie that came out not too long ago ""In Her Shoes,"" but it's not exactly scintilating literature and it was not succeeding at holding my attention. I bought it forever ago and it was the only thing to grab off my shelf when I was running out of the house this morning, other than textbooks. I have a couple of those with me too, but I didn't feel like reading them either. Oh well. Instead, I will make the longest eljay post EVER!

My eyes were getting entirely too tired reading that book and, if I don't get called for round four, which I'm next to positive I won't, I get to drive home. The only problem with that is that I am now so exhausted that driving might be less than intelligent. I was out carousing all night with those crazy town drunkards, so now I'm out of steam with no caffiene to keep me going. Oh well.

The computers won't let me get onto myspace or facebook, so I really have nothing else to do. Orange County schools have blocked out all email and all sites that could even insinuate fun in order to ensure that no enjoyment is had while on the school premesis. That's my assumption, anyway.

For all of those that have been on the debate circuit for any remnant of time, let me throw out a name and see if it rings any bells. Marna Weston. Marna Weston is standing behind me, turning in a ballot. Ah, Mr. Marna, you are a funny, funny man. And what the hell are you doing here? I thought you were like gone, forever? Hmm. Who knows.

I am totally random today. Just FYI. I don't usually make random posts because I don't usually have time. But, when I'm not judging and blowing off homework, I definitely have time.

Last night was the first night in a long time where I felt good about myself. Not just myself, because I've been really good for a couple of days, but like, the way I looked and such. I have been in a crappy, I don't want to look like a girl mood for a while now. The show was an excuse to dress up, look like a girl and have fun with makeup. I missed doing that. When I had any remnant of solid free time, I did it all the time. Now, I'm back to really only doing it for special occasions, cause I have to get up in the morning and go to school and sometimes, work, *gasp*.

Haven't been to PJs in a while, actually. I had too much going on at once and it was really draining on my soul. Got a $273 paycheck before I asked her to take me off the schedule though, so that was nice. It will tide me over until I get the government money moving. 

Reminder, get the government money moving. 

Sigh, I'll add it to my list.

I have a lot of reading I should be doing for American History and such and a quiz to take. I don't feel like reading and I don't have all the material for the quiz. So, nevermind. One of the books we have to read for Am. Hist. is called ""Intimate Matters: A history of sexuality in America."" It's a really interesting book, but so repetitive that I want to stab myself in the toe. Between it, my sociology book, and the overlap between my sociology book and my speech book (wierd, huh?) I feel like I am reading the same stuff, over and over. Blegh. Oh well, I really, really do enjoy college. Like a lot. I like doing work again and feeling smart. And I've met a few kinda cool people. Gotta meet more though, I don't have anyone to talk to on campus ('cept Landon, of course!). I might get a job at Disney just to make some friends. I'm not sure though. I don't really want to work for the mouse, as scheduling is ridiculous and I don't feel like dealing with any of them. I like that I can set my own hours at PJs and it's totally flexible. That's what I get for working with my second Mom.

People are starting to filer back in, so they should be doing judge call again soon. Hopefully. YAY going home... 

Much love to all. Sorry for the ridiculously long and incredibly pointless post. I needed to occupy my brain.

Including itchy.

This is totally gross, but I have had hives everywhere for the past three days. I am majorly allergic to latex, and, without knowing it, wore shoes with latex soles to work. For seven hours. My feet were totally gross. Two days later, they showed up all over. I've not been eating or drinking normally in the past couple weeks, so the enzymes just kinda sat around and made me really sick.  I'm gross. I feel like a leper. An itchy, yucky, disgusting leper. Ugh. Itchy.

Spence and I are fixed. I can breathe again. I totally feel better about almost everything now. The more I think about it, the more it was looming for a really, really long time. Longer than we've ever kept anything from each other. 

It's been really hard because, all of a sudden, I don't see anyone that I know. I don't have any contact with people aside from someone I bump into in a hallway or someone I hardly know at work. I was sitting at home, being depressed, without realizing it.

I felt stressed about everything, when it was all an easy fix. I took myself off the schedule at work, I'm going to talk to the people at Highland and try to work something else out. If they want me to give back money, I'm ok with that. I just want to feel like my days are mine. For the first few weeks of school, they felt anything but that.I was running around doing too many new things at once.

I have wonderful friends. Friends that I don't have to forget now that I'm not in high school or ""trying to grow up."" I guess the facade that is provided as a senior in high school is that you're going to leave and forget everything and high school won't matter. Maybe what you learned won't matter, but it doesn't mean you have to forget people or involvements. If it happens, that's just a fact of life. I was so consumed with the idea that I had to ""start over"" that I forgot that people who have been there for me for most of my life, aren't just going to go away. And they don't have to. I have a lot of friends who aren't in high school, but are still around, that have proven to be my backbone over the past couple weeks. Leanne, Christine, Jonny, Barbara, everyone from the Players. While I'm sad that I don't get to do anything with them over the next couple of weeks, I'm ok with it becuase I know all of those people are still going to be around when I need them. They didn't just forget me, I have no reason to forget them. 

I'm trying to make friends in college, but it's hard when I have very little interest in hanging around campus. I met at girl in my soc. class who is really cool. She signed me in on the day I had a total campus meltdown, which was related to a whole lot more than college. I felt like I had no friends around me, ever, and I was hurting cause Spence never had any time for me. I was totally lost and isolated and really, really needed hugs and friends and something to help me. My plan didn't work out the way I thought it would, but it didn't need to. I still have everything I want and it doesn't matter otherwise.

Friends don't have to be new when you start college. And if new ones aren't all there right away, then it doesn't matter. Sometimes, the people who have known you longer are the ones you need anyway. You don't have to explain things. They just know. And they just hug you when you need to be hugged and show up at your doorstep for unexplained reasons when  you feel like you are going to loose your mind. 

And they watch Team America with you when you're miserable and covered in hives.

You can't burn a bridge in a real friendship. Sometimes you just have to take the time to repair it. Sometimes, you just need time before it can be repaired. 

Are we a steel bridge that has taken a beating from natural disasters or reckless drivers? If you think you're one of these people, IM me, email me, talk to me, I've got a construction crew waiting.

You know where to find me. Luckily, I don't think this applies to many."

"event","I try to do everything on my own.  It's my way of ensuring that I am not as crazy as I think I am.  If I get scared, I keep it to myself, wait it out, hope it goes away. Same with worry, hurt, anger, etc. Sometimes I yell it out, cry it out, whatever, but I never thought I needed anymore help than that.

I was wrong.

I actually had to break down and ask my parents for help. I'm the only family member that has never needed anything from my Dad. Turns out, I was just the one running from it the longest. 

College is scary,  but I'm getting through it. Everyday, there are little victories. I felt good enough to go to Lake Highland after school the other day. That was awesome. When I got there, I didn't even do any work. Danielle was waiting for her Mom and we ended up going to Einsteins and then sitting around talking. She is the funniest kid ever. The Highland thing ended  up working out perfectly. I don't have to quit and I can spend more time doing a multitude of things. I am so busy right now, that it is insane. 

Part of this whole struggle has been that I felt like I failed myself and everyone around me by not being able to handle things like everyone else. It's been a lifelong battle that I thought I had under control. I didn't. And then I hit bottom so hard. The difference between this time and last is that I know I can get through this, this time. I want to. I don't want to sit around and cry and think that nothing will ever be right again. I will get through this whatever way I have to. If that means admitting weaknesses and getting help from places that are not within me, then I guess I will have to humble myself long enough to fix whatever is in front of me. 

What I'm taking really does help. And while I feel better, it kind of upsets me. Part of me wanted it not to work so I could prove that it's something I have to handle on my own. But, I feel astronomically better when I take it. Yesterday, I didn't because I figured I was in a situation that I'm familiar with, hanging out at home and with Spence and Tony, but I really could feel a difference. I just wanted to sleep, jokes weren't funny, I didn't want to laugh. I didn't end up going out with them like they wanted me to, came home, took what I needed to and started smiling again. I feel like I can take on the world.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've tried to do things on my own for so long, but I was totally wrong. I need help. I need someone to talk to. I need someone who will ask the right questions and get to the bottom of whatever is weighing on my heart and my mind. I have incredible friends who have been offering to do this for years, but I never know what to say. I need someone who can ask the questions that will trigger the right answers, if that makes sense? Vague inquisitions about what is upsetting me are impossible for me to answer to. 

I feel a little shaky at the moment,  but that's for a myriad of reasons. I ate at Max's, which <i>always</i> makes me really ill. I have been eating there almsot every night for five years and I have yet to learn not to eat there. Also, I spend a whole bunch of money today on a computer. I have never spent so much money before. It made me so nervous watching the balance in my checking account drop like that, but the computer is amazing.
IMac G5, 20 inch, bitches. So pretty.

I have been through such insanity in the past week. Things that I never thought would happen. Arguments that I never thought I would need to have. Realizations that I never thought I'd come to. A new computer, new acquaintances, new books and homework assignments. New me and new outlooks on everyone around me. 

Scary.

On a totally different note, I love Christine Keppler. She is my savings grace and go to girl when things in my perfect little bubble aren't right. She just gets it. Knows what to say, is angry when I'm angry and makes me laugh to no end. I <3 Christine."

"event","What a stressful shitty week. There is so much homework to be done that i havnt started. It sucks. I hate school! I wish my parents were rich, If i was rich I'd movie to hawaii. Id live in a shack on the beach get really fat and just sit and play my ukalaylay all day.But thats not going to happen. So i have to do my homework :-(. I don't like teachers. None of them want us to learn they just assign us things to get our grades in the book so it looks like they did a good job.  I dk. I dont like school. This week i went to school either high high or caffine high each day. because after last weekend going back to that place is the worst thing ever. 


I wont get into much detail cuz there r plenty of things i regret about last weekend, but i was with my two best friends in my favorite place. We didn't even end up going to the beach but we just slept and sat around the campfire during the day. and partied with new people everynight. We drank a lot but i didnt get hung over once. Which is a plus for me. I love maine especially salty acres. When u get there ur just so relaxed and everyone is nice and says hi. I havnt gone to maine once without making a new friend.  Now im just depressed. But my parents r going out for the night so im gunna start my hw then probably smoke a few bowls and frolic around.... 


Ahh i hate school!"

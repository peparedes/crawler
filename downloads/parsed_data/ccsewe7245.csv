"event","Long time no talk.  What a crazy first week off of school.  On Saturday my grandpa passed away.  It was probably one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with.  I was closer to him than my grandma that passed away so that made it even more difficult.  I love him and will always love my grandpa.  I had some support from my friends and for that I thank you, but I wish my friends were a little more there for me...oh well, what are you gonna do...it's really about your family anyways. 
    Little girls cheer camp coming up, I'm excited, but i'm sick. Tomorrow is tuesday (i've been writing this entry over time) and I hope i am better by tomorrow!  So i can back to doing what I love. lol.

Lets just say i am confused about lots of stuff right now.  But i love everyone of my girls and guys!

"event","Welps, only two barely half days left.  wOwZeRz I am almost a senior.  I am still in shock! no! I'm just a baby! I can't go to college in a year.  Yeah, that one should be interesting.  
Finals haven't been all so bad, just kinda long and annoying most of the time, u are just like, ENOUGH ALREADY. 
Today at work we sabatoged Nick's Cobalt.  We put a cup of ketchup on his seat and Julia decided to spell poop on the hood out of bread pieces.  OH JULIA.  Then I put stacks of bread on his antenna with one right on top.  It was pretty funny, harmless to his car too.  SO, no big deal.  I really got a true laugh out of that one.  I love Nick.
Friday is a party at Jims, juniors and sophs I guess, hoping to stay the night at Hannah's after...SCHOOLS OUT NEWAYS!
Welp, give me some end of the year comments babes! Somethin to remember this year by.

"event","Well, this is the last public entry I am gonna post, because people who get joy out of tattling on me are sick.  I guess it's my fault for making it public in the first place.  
Tomorrow starts finals and the very LAST WEEK of school.  I am very excited about that.  I am so sick and tired of school.  I can't believe I am gonna be a senior next year.  That's absolutely crazy if ya ask me.  I am still an itty bitty freshman!  Well, what do you know?  these years just fly by.  It should be a pretty nice summer.  I am thinkin thats bout right.  
I am getting pretty sick of people who act like their lives are either pretty awful when the whole world and the moon are in love with them and worship at their feet, or they are the center of attention.  How could anyone possibly whine so much and have so much at the same time, and don't u realize that you don't have to be the center of attention.  It's like, be thankful for what you've got and treat people with some respect man.  I think being fake stinks lots.  I am just happy that I realize the difference.  
I just wanna say that I love the people who are so amazing to me and always there for me.  You just dont get that often enough and that makes me even more thankful for it.  I love you guys so much!!!!!

Good luck studying for finals everyone!

I can't wait for summer...it's gonna be amazing.  I was watching the One Tree Hill finale and I was like, oh wow I really can't wait, because I saw how they were acting and I was like, you just can't be that happy when ur in school at LHWL caged up like a little monkey!  Finals are gonna be a biotch, especially math.  And I need like an 81%.  Ugh lets hope and pray.  Cheerleading cuts are today, so that means the week is over and now we go to just every wednsday practices at open gym.  I can't wait for stunt and tumble camp its gonna be tight.  Hannah, Liz, Erica, and I put up a pretty solid elevator to extension yesterday, so there's one solid stunt for us.  I am excited about that!  I think I have a pretty good idea of who's gonna make varsity, but there is still some iffys, and some that think they can make comments and be in charge when they have to wait their turn....nazi.  anyways, lets just hope it all works out.  Well, this weekend will be a nice break, having monday off and all.  Hope I get to do what I wanna do!

Last night was prom and it was pretty fun.  The food was okay, the music was good, and everyone looked adorable in their dresses.  By the end of the night I was pretty beat, however, and I decided not to go to Nick's house after, and just go home.  Plus, I had a bad ending to the night with Rob.  I knew it was gonna have to be this way though.  You just can't get around it when you're trying to move on.  I didnt wake up till 11:30 this morning and that was only on account that adam called me.  I just picked up the phone and hung up everyone of the three times he called.  Damnit Adam, didnt you know i had prom last night?  Anyways, I had fun last night with Hannah and all my junior friends as well as Laura and Alyssa.  Everyone looked so pretty! Can't wait to get pics developed.

Finding it really hard right now to be excited for prom because a) Ap test is tomorrow and I am so sick of history/I know when I look at the test I am gonna be overwhelmed because I am gonna have to make up stuff cuz I wont know it.  No, its not the fact that I care what I get, I just dont wanna take a test for four hours, oh well, I'll do my best, wish me luck and b) recent findings out about a new guy by the date makes him oh so not happy.  Oh well, make the best out of it I guess is all you gotta do.

All I gotta say is that at 12 o clock tomorrow I am gonna be so happy because AP is finally gonna be basically over.  I am soo sicky icky icky of it!  

Listen to me complain while everyone is going through so much more, pray for the Sieloff's and the Sliva's who have both lost a grandparent.  Pray for Mr.Sliva who is still recovering and hurting.  Pray for my Nat to have strength.  Pray for my grandpa who was just recently released from the hospital and is struggling.  Lord, be with everyone who is hurting right now.

All I know is that I love one of my friends very much and shes been there for me a million times, and I am not about to bad mouth her.  And I am sick and tired of hearing someone who doesn't even know her say lies about her that shes heard and I can't even tell her they're lies cuz she'll believe anything a certain person tells her cuz they're like BFF.  I just know its all crap and a bag of chips.  I don't understand why a person expects me to stand behind them when they've screwed me over so many times and I try to be so nice to them, letting them make fun of me to my face and not even talking back, listening to their tears, and yet still they have zero respect.  When did anyone think they were so much better than me to treat me like that?   All I know is none of its about me.  It sure isn't.  So I am gonna be friends with the ones who know how to be friends back.  I am NOT mad at anyone.  I just know that I never did ANYTHING wrong.

I know that really only semester grades count, so I should be able to bring this quarter up to even them out. It's just not that easy sometimes tho.  I also missed that whole week and a bunch of classes here and there when I was having my health problems.  That killed me in a lot of places.  I just really wish that last quarter I wasnt so busy so I could have had time to concentrate on things more.  But now I do have time to do that...so I am gonna.  I studied really well for my AP test last night, and I'm crossing my fingers.  I should be okay.  Nevertheless, now I cant watch TV, go on the internet, or (I am guessing although it was not stated), that I cant go out either.  But in some ways I think I deserve it.

We were expecting to get last, so we were pleasantly surprised.  I am so proud of everyone!  I love you guys, thank you for the best season I have possibly ever had.  I am SOOO excited for next year.  This has made this year all the more exciting and happy.  I love you Laura, Lyss, Lindsay, Erica, Liz, Kaitlyn, Kristina, Becc, Vickie, Lenore, Ashley, Sara, and Kat.  I will miss you SENIORS you're my girls.  

Soooo Tired right now!

Pray for the Parish's guys...they really need you.

"event","I guess some people aren't as excited as I thought they would be about going to states.  I mean, its kinda a once in a lifetime thing, is how I see it.  But thats okay, there are a few of us really excited and thats all I need.  Its this Sat at 9 at Saginaw Valley State University.  We are staying the night at a hotel probably because we don't wanna get up at 4:30 and drive to Saginaw.  Makes sense to me.  I just feel blessed to have this opportunity.  Mrs. Liggett was so ecstatic.  This has never happened to her before and she just can't believe it.  I am more happy for her than for the rest of us.  

However, there is still some stuff that is making me sad once in a while.  I just wish sometimes that things were different.  But right now, I am just too happy about cheerleading to have it be the center of my life.

"event","Okay, we're freaking going to STATES!  That's right you heard me! Cuz the winner of each region and any team that get 95% of their score gets to go, but not every team did that so the slots weren't all filled, so they calculated percentages and therefore we got 80% of Clawson's score (#1 in our region) and we get to GO!!! ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone was freaking out today when I called them and told them and I was crying when Mrs.Liggett told me!  I can't even believe it! I dont even care if we get last, its still amazing!!!!!!!!

"event","Well, cheerleading's over now (not im my mind however, cuz u know me always ready for next year) I am hoping to have open gyms once a month or something as well as through the summer tho, cuz everyone already has new ideas for next year.  It's amazing how much that competition pumped us up.  But finally, I have the spring season off.  I like being busy, but I also love having a break once in a while too (and a nice paycheck every two weeks).  Hannah is still trying to figure out what my livejournal name means, but she never will, and I wont ever tell her.  Lets just say it has something to do with something that I wish I could take back. (she'll still never get it)  Speaking of that work thing, time for me to take a nap and do my AP before I go in at 5.  See ya!

"event","Wow, today was our competiton.  Everything was going fine and dandy until rebecca fell and broke her arm...what are the odds.  I felt so bad for her I started balling, as did the rest of the team.  They rolled her away and she blew us a kiss.  However, we all had to suck it up.  We put our jv flyer in for Rebecca and she really stepped it up.  We had to take out a few extra elements that would have probably gave us a few more points, but it was okay with me.  We ended up nailing everything really well and I was so proud of everyone.  We still got 3rd (out of 5 teams) but I think its pretty good with a girl having a broken arm the day of.  I love all my girls so much and this will be a season I will never forget. Laura, Alyssa, and Lindsay I will miss you.  And to all the girls coming back next year, we got this.  Well, Good Night!

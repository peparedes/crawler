2 strings walk in to a bar 
the first tries to order 
the bartender says We dont serve strings and throws him out of the bar 
so the second ties his ends together and walks in 
the bartender says, didnt you hear what I told your friend 
""Yeah, arent you a string""? 
to which the string replied 
I'm a frayed knot

and

thebilldozer75: the other one says

"event","You have to use an air-drier in a bathroom, and all it spits out is a pathetic breeze of cold air 

Walking around in socks and suddenly stepping in water 

The Blue Screen of Death 

After drying your hands and then face, you realize the towel you just used smells awful 

The classic question: is it me that's causing this stench? 

The Elusive Missing Sock 

Dry-mouth out of nowhere and you can't drink enough water to quench it

Sudden Internet Lag 

You're having a good time holding and playing with a baby until spit-up comes out of nowhere and hits you (note: I used landed some spit-up directly in my dad's mouth - now that's impressive) 

A light bulb blows out, or even worse, two 

You step in poop, and it's even worse if you don't have anything to clean it off with 

There's a long line that you have to wait in, and after you have suffered wasting all that time, you look back and the line is short 

You drop a pen and reach down to get it and you can't find it...somehow it's bounced around, rolled, and skipped about a mile away and is tucked in a corner under a shadow"

"event","You completely jumble-up what you wanted to say, and have to stop and laugh at stupid you sounded 

Bad-Breath-Close-Talkers 

Being in a social group where everyone present is a type of person you don't want to be around...and you just keep looking at your watch... 

Someone is speaking to you and the only thing you can focus on is the accumulation of spittle at the corners of his/her mouth or the booger flinging in and out of his/her nose as they breathe 

Someone catches you staring absent-mindedly at them, and the person thinks you like him/her 

When it's impossible to tell the person you are looking past that you aren't really looking at him/her but at someone or something beyond him/her"

You have a Brainfart when spelling a common word 

Ripping a page when turning 

Tripping on anything, knocking a full glass over, and other clumsy actions 

You set something down, and one minute later you have no idea where it is 

You say something you immediately regret 

Barely missing a deadling of anything because you simply forgot 

Screwing up a person's name...especially when they nail yours"

You're doing something important and you can faintly hear someone eating in close proximity and every little trivial sound they make becomes the most annoying thing in the world 

Someone asks you an important question during mid-ingestion and mastication 

Anytime food falls out of your mouth 

You're at someone's house and they serve your least favorite food, and you are almost forced by good will to eat it and compliment the taste

Leaving a drop of milk in the carton 

Leaving only a sheet or two of toilet paper - oh, thanks buddy! 

Dog or other pet poops/pees in an undisclosed location and you can't find it because EVERYTHING now smells 

Someone bumping a board game table like Risk...everyone stops and stares at them 

Obnoxious bubble-gum chewing or eating with his/her mouth wide open 

Someone gets ridiculously easily offended 

Someone lets slip the ending to a movie, video game, book, etc"

Your nose is almost TOO clear and it's disturbing to take full breaths through it 

The gross, groggy post-nap feeling 

Pulling a hangnail and it rips about a full centimeter-long trench from the cuticle 

Stubbing your toe; it's just awful 

Lasting electric stinging sensation from hitting your funny bone 

Dry-mouth out of nowhere and you can't drink enough water to quench it 

Skin over a blister rips off - NO way to ease this pain

Biting your tongue 

That stupid pimple on the inside of your nostril that's impossible to get at and hurts like mad when you go after it 

Acidic Diarrhea...you know you hate it..."

I'll still keep the website, and if a good host pops up, we'll bring it back, but for now I'm figuring that this'll work just fine.

Plus, here anyone can comment and add thoughts.

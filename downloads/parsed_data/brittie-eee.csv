Hello, good morning, how you do?
What makes your rising sun so new?
I could use a fresh beginning too
All of my regrets are nothing new
So this is the way that I say I need You
This is the way that I'm

Learning to breathe
I'm learning to crawl
I'm finding that You and You alone can break my fall
I'm living again, awake and alive
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies

Hello, good morning, how you been?
Yesterday left my head kicked in
I never, never thought that
I would fall like that
Never knew that I could hurt this bad

So this is the way I say I need You
This is the way that I say I love You
This is the way that I say I'm Yours
This is the way, this is the way

"event","Yeah so ever since I woke up this morning I have been on the computer...as usual. I've actually been having some pretty funny conversations with Jarrod..haha ""Aonghus713: or i could flip the board and run for my life""....now that would be extremely hilarious. So after leaving the computer chair for about 5 minutes I went to go get my dunkin donuts tea and my mmmmm pumpkin muffin. It was absolutely amazing, plus I still have a half left! Whoo hoo. Then mi madre loves to yell at me and tell me I need to clean my room instead of being on the computer...but It's not really bad, just my clothes are scattered :-\. It happens, what can I say? 
So with It being Sunday and all tonight is going to be filled with the joys of *shiver* homework...oh yeah and my stupid psychology project. I really hate projects with a passion..the only project I enjoyed doing was my movie with Chris, Eric, and J.J. hahah some fun times with that one. But before I do that I have got to hit the mall..yet again.. for my winter vest thingy at American Eagle. Oh yes, and my new jeans that I did not purchase yesterday. But I'll update when I get home later..I need to go clean up the dormitorio before my mom comes upstairs again... Adios

Oh yeah...""Te Despacio"" ;)"

"event","Okay so today was um....fun. Mz. Kaity Crandall slept over mi casa last night at the late time of 9:45 because I didn't get service in Mr. Rienzo's house so therefore whenever somebody called me my phone never rang! So that was pretty nuts. Then me being an idiot that I am was outside in the rain last night..now I feel like crap-ola. Kaity left in the wee-hours of the morning (7) for her fencing tourney. I felt bad...she was so tired and I felt like I was commiting a crime when I woke her up lol. So after I groggily walked her to the door I ran back upstairs and slept for about another 4 hours. So after waking up at around 10:40ish I decided to drag my lazy bum to the mall to try to find new jeans...It's kind of ironic I bought holey jeans from AE in the beginning of the school yeah and the once small hole is now the size of my knee! So as I forced myself through the mall while feeling like crap I found an AWESOME scarf that I seriously just fell head over heels in love with. That made my day :). After that I had to go to best buy for mi padre to buy ink cartrages? wtf...who sends a 16 year old female for computer accesories? Nuts...Im telling you. But while I was there I caught a glimpse of the Seether cd..so I bought it and have been jamming to it since. Soooo after that Kim called me and was all frantic and sounded like she was going to die so I was like ""okay kim, if I bring you food, will you feel better?"" and of course she agreed...So I drove to Wendy's and then went to Kim's for a while. So on my attempt to leave..Kim walks me out to my car and then the most scariest thing was in my subaru..a BEE! I stood around for 5 minutes waiting for that thing to fly out of my car with the fear I was going to be stung. Finally, It left and I had a great wave of relief. I drove home and then just collapsed on my bed....feeling like crap and really really just sick. After telling Jarrod for about an hour that I felt like such a jerk for not being able to hang out with steve and others tonight He finally just coaxed me out of feeling bad and to ""get rest"" so that is what I did....I napped :)! It was great, Napping is such a wonderful thing. But a long with feeling crappy other things have been going through my mind...which will stay there since I don't want to put TOO much information on this live journal. But anywhom this is my first journal and It's going to end here since I have got to chiz-at with KAYTE My love! :) So Gute Nacht all!"

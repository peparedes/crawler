I wrecked it monday. His fault, he's paying for the repairs and perhaps a rental car in the mean time. I really don't mind because I needed to fix some things on the car anyway.

Uhh.. That's about it. In case anyone was wondering, I'm still dating the same guy I was a year ago. Yeah, that Ryan fellow. It's stupendous and I'm gonna make him marry me. He bought me a sapphire ring with diamonds on it for my birthday, and then he surprised me even more by getting me sapphire earrings. Super awesome.

I have to pee and the toilet here in College Park is all.. Not working, so it's just a vat of everyone's piss, it's kind of freaking me out so I have to go make Ryan hurry the fuck up so we can get to Lenox so I can pee."

Scenario:
Place: Panera Bread(In Conyers)

We(Ryan and I), have met his parents for lunch, their treat. After we go through his dad flippping out about not getting his food and the people who work there being assholes(Normally Panera is amazing and doesn't do these things. They're amazing.) We're all sitting at the table and his mother is talking to me and commenting on how messy both Ryan and his father are. I take a bite of my sandwich as she next comments, ""Yeah, just wait til you two start having kids! Hahaha.."" I immediately snap my head in the direction of the audience and stare for a second, then I start laughing. Ryan is laughing his ass off and is turning bright red, except for his ears. Odd. So we laugh and then she says, ""You know.. Because they'll be really messy and Ryan doesn't like to clean up.""

Basically that's it. What the hell. She's a crazy woman. Very amusing woman.

"event","Well fuck. Seems life kind of sucks.

I mean.. The little things in life you know.. I still have a place to sleep, things to eat(God forbid. Already fat. Psh..), a car, and a job.

But it's the little things in life that really make life worthwhile right? I mean.. Things like friends, letting loose, getting all worked up over nothing. It's good to know at least you have something to care about to get worked up over.

I can complain all night about how much I want something, or don't want something.

But would it help? How would that change the situation? I worked to try to get the things I want. But the things I want obviously don't want me, or else I'd have them.

The worst thing in the world is wanting something and knowing you can't have it. Ever.

It's times like this I wish I lived in a Walgreen's world. Where everything is perfect.

But of course naturally I'd have to go in and have complete chaos and anarchy, because that's punk rock, right? That's the punk rock thing to do. Claim anarchy on everything and everyone. I mean.. That's.. What I'm supposed to do, right?"

Maybe not. But the aftertaste, and just taste in general of it, reminds me of vomit.

This morning I woke up with my neck, eyes, head, throat, and just general.. All of my head region feeling like shit. I also had horrid cramps from that whole.. Period thing. Ugh. Then my comtact scratched my eye at some point and it hurts like a bitch, of course. I don't have the contact in anymore... That would be dumb.

So I slept until about.. Twelve thirty, with my sliding glass door open. Today is glorious as far as weather goes. I might actually go to the park with a blanket and read or something. I'm very much like the movies. And while I'm there someone will throw a ball, and it will hit my book, or my head, and I'll be angry then see it's the hero of this romantic comedy I call life.

Okay maybe not.

Speaking of next wednesday.. Goin' to see the Taj! And some other people.. But most importantly THE TAJ! I haven't seen them in forever. It'll be good. Then on April 28th I'm leaving for ska weekend with Pam and a bunch of her friends.

"event","Man.. I need to update with a couple of things.

1) I'm tired of seeing all of this Anti-Bush bullshit. I mean.. He won. Okay. You don't like him. Okay. You're angry at other people for having their own views on something? Woah, what? I'm sorry, but last time I checked everyone was entitled to their own opinion. Kerry is a fucking moron. All you democrats get angry now. Bush is a fucking moron, but knows how to control an army better than Kerry. All you republicans get angry because you only read part of that. They both lie like hell. Everyone get uppity. Sit down mother fuckers, everyone does things that people won't agree with, why don't you try to see both sides of the argument instead of being a closed minded little shit?

Holy hell, anyway.. Time for poop, I mean number two.

2) I can legally drive. I got my license.

3) I can't legally drive, my parents refuse to put me on their insurance to drive the truck because it's ""expensive."" I'm sorry, what did they just buy a little while ago? OH THAT'S RIGHT, A FUCKING CROSSFIRE. A FUCKING SPORTS CAR. A FUCKING CAR THAT YOU CAN'T DO SHIT IN BECAUSE IT HOLDS TWO PEOPLE. HOW SILLY OF ME FOR FORGETTING THOSE KEY FACTS. Instead of buying two cheap cars that would have worked nicely, and would have gotten me around and off their backs, they got a fucking shit-mobile with pretty buttons and a sleek exterior. Fuck all you mother fucks that say that car is so fucking cool. I hate that car. 

4) I applied at a bunch of places today. Maybe I'll get a job and will be able to do stuff, like snort coke and buy scrapbooking supplies, man that's the life.(If you think I'm serious about that, you need to die right now. You're stupid.)

5) My dad called me a freak when he was drunk last night. Mmm.. Warm fuzzies all over. I yelled almost at the top of my lungs for him to shut up after I was done arguing with him. Again, damn I feel like loving my family.

6) I forgot to add.. I'm not getting a car anytime soon either I don't think. My parents keep saying how we ""have no money."" So.. We're poor, but are driving a crossfire around, hmm...

7) I turned 18 a while ago, and today I went out with Amanda to go to Starship, but we totally couldn't find the place because I'm a fuck and couldn't remember the directions. Let's ignore the fact that I slept on the way up there and it's a miracle I remembered as much as I did and pieced it all together. Damn I'm awesome.

8) If you like it up the butt, clap your hands."

One) I'm going to decorate my room. Why do I have to tell everyone this? Well I'll explain. On either one of my walls, or inside all three of the walls in my closet, I'm going to dedicate that area to my friends. How does this work? Well! I'll tell you. I'm going to have everyone come over and sign it. Write a quote, a message, an inside joke, anything. I don't care. Something more than just your name. It will be like a yearbook, but on the walls instead. And you can write in anything you want, markers, pencils, colored pencils, sharpies, anything. Any color(No highlighter you assholes.) and anything. As long as it is something the family will be able to paint over one day. SO NO CARVING, FUCKHEADS, THIS ISN'T A BATHROOM STALL. But yeah, I'll be moving things around in my room soon, so feel free to come over whenever to write on my walls. You can write anything you want, cuss words, sex things, I don't care. Draw pictures.. Whatever. As long as everyone doesn't draw a penis. Or maybe I'll have everyone draw a penis and make it the border around the bottom. Heh.. Anyway.. Yeah. YAY!!

Two) I'm also going to arrange get togethers every week. What happens at these? Well we all go to the park, playground, or something, somewhere where we can be loud and obnoxious, because  that's what we do. Please, accept it, we're all a bunch of annoying fucks. Anyway, and then we'll have one or two people bring disposable cameras, or a disposable and a digital. Disposable because I like to have tangible pictures. I like the way they look and feel and stuff. None of this hightech shit.

So I'm in summer school, as most of you probably know, and during summer school we do things like.. Play soccer, or hockey.

I love both. And it makes me sad because I know when summer school ends I won't be able to play with the people anymore and do those games that I love so much.

SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I'm officially going to start playing soccer and hockey with my friends. I'm inviting everyone to join me and others once, or more, a week to play soccer or hockey somewhere.

My friend Mike, whom lives in england, told me about how when it rains there he and his friends automatically meet at the soccer field and play. I think that's really cool and I'd like to do that. I know Georgia weather sucks ass and it doesn't rain for long, but still it would be fun.

So anyway, anyone that wants to get involved is welcome. It's a good way for us all to hang out together. And you can invite anyone you want. :D"

We're still doing stupid teenage things(Piercing my own tongue and lying about it!), but we're also growing up(Handling our grades and knowing we'll need this later in life.)

I don't really know what I wanted to say, but I'm worried about growing up. I'm afraid I'm not going to be like I am now.. I'm afraid I'll lose grasp of things, like other adults. I don't want to lose what I have.

I don't know, maybe I'm not ready to grow up?

Next year.. I won't be able to make it through a lot of things. Next year I am going to cry a lot. All of my friends will be leaving me behind because of that year that I fucked up so badly. I regret doing that, but it also taught me some things, so I'm glad it happened.

Stephanie, I was looking through your webshots account and I saw that picture of you next to your car, and you're in a stripped blue and white shirt. You look 18. You look like when you see someone else you don't know, and you find out they're 18, and you think, ""Wow.. They look it."" Grown up. It's odd to see your friends as their grown up selves.

I love my friends.. As much as I complain and bitch and whatever, I love them and I wouldn't have gotten this far, or learned what I did, or had the experiences I've had without them.

"event","So uhm.. When I got my hair cut, they used hairspray right? Well I went out and bought hairspray that day to use on my hair. I used the hairspray this morning, and I found out on the way home that I had bumps all over my right cheek. I thought it was just from the heat and I was breaking out, but I don't do the breaking out thing. So I was thinking about it later and BAM.. It hit me, not literally, but yeah.. I realised that I probably had the bumps from the hairspray. My sister and I both agree that my skin had an allergic reaction to something in the hairspray. We even tried again. I stood with my head upside down and she sprayed, and after a few minutes the bumps were back and were red and such, and they kinda itched. So yeah.. We're going to take the hairspray back, and I doubt we'll be getting another kind.

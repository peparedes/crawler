"event","well so far today has gone pretty well considering its only the begining of 2nd period...English was good just read the hole time...Me and Ethan got in an argument about why they lost the soccer game yesterday...I came to the conclusion that Ethan lost it for them because he almost made a goal that would have tide the game but it hit the post...then as i was walking to computers coach hunt and myette (the track coaches) walked out of the bathroom together and were like ya its all skylers fault and then he accidentally on pourpose hit me...In computers now me and Rachel are looking for new icons for our livejournals i got a friends one but Rachel is getting madder and madder because all on the interent they only have like buffy the vampire icons and other just stupid ones.....

"event","Things are about to get a whole lot easier. No, really, they are. But I suppose this is a bit like saying to someone, in the middle of a thunderstorm, that things are soon going to get a whole lot dryer. More rain may yet lie ahead. The skies are still far from blue. Nonetheless, the future contains less stress than the past. You have already been through the worst part of a difficult drama. Your current struggle may prove irksome or upsetting, but you will be able to go beyond it this weekend, and able, too, to start seeing what it has all been in aid of and why this has been so worthwhile. To find out whether you are currently under the influence of any major, personal planetary transits"

Well as of 8:49 AM we have Only 1 day, 5 hours, 20 minutes, and 53 seconds left until winter break! Well there have been a lot of things on my mind latly.  Its wierd it seems like everyone is changing and im not.  Its not that big a of thing because i know everyone will say that i have changed bla bla bla.  One thing i dont understand is how like even if i get a good grade on a test my dad can only yell at me about how i didnt tell him that i was having a test.  He yells at me about how i dont study engough even though i have raised my gades and have 2 As 2Bs and 1C wich is almost a B and the B is almost an A. o well it doesnt matter once chirstmas breaks starts my dad wont be so stressed out and hopefully he wont make me study the hole two weeks!.  the rest of today and tomaro should be pretty easy no more tests or anything!

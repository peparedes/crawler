"event","Its quite an interesting feeling you know. Waking up one frosty winters morning, deep in thought, only to be shaken from your semi-consciousness at mid-day whilst crossing a busy street, nearly missing a two story bus, ignorning (unintentionally)the calls and greetings of several friends an aquaintances, only to realize that wish to be an oceanic photographer, not a marine biologist.

So, dismissing this as, 'its 9 Tuesday  morning and I will justify anything that allows me to quickly return to the confines of my nice warm bed', I continue on to two lectures. I don't even remember how I got there. I have been in such a state since waking up it seems as if I am only now prying my eyes open to Belfast, now, this very second (read: 10 seconds ago when I entry began).


I don't have trouble making choices! What is this nonsense?!

"event","Alright. This is how it works. If you (the stranger), leave me (the wanted), an adorably persuasive message, I will in turn add you to my coveted list of friends. At this point in time there are few mortals who I deem eligible for such a privelge, but if you are intelligent enough to create something that impresses me, you will join the ranks. Good luck and God Bless."

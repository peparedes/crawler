"event","So Ive recently read He's Just Not that Into You and wow -- I could not love that book more ( at least i dont think) anyways...guys...so much easier than girls make them out to be --- if they dont like you some warning signs-- they dont ask you out, call you, have time to call you, date you, sleep with you, sleep with only you, make excuses of odd natures. Guys just let girls make up excuses for them b/c they dont want to crush their feelings (great idea..wink wink ). 
     I mean looking back on... im going to say a few particular situations...it becomes unbelievably obvious(now, of course) that those guys were just not into me-- and its ok. Im an idiot for not seeing it, but most girls never do. Most gay guys never do. 
     I mean its sort of hilarious to think back on the funny calls travis got, random blurts of interest cody had to encounter for like years, the letter poor greg found in his car, and the awkward convo's michael had to sit through. Sucks to be them.ha. Im betting they, along with myself, wish I would have gotten that book a long time ago. Oops. 
    All I can say is that now Im mostly normal, I mean yes...greg calling still sometimes gets me-- but the others all got off pretty easy. And maybe I knew all along... greg could never feel for me what i felt for him...i mean i knew cody never would like me again...travis and I had nothing in common..and i mean with michael i knew he didnt actually give a shit... but i didnt care at all...with any of them- i started that with my eyes open i just didnt realize i was going to lie to myself as much as I did for as long as i did-- and it only got worse as I went along. I got alittle better at tricking myself into believing all the excuses I made up for them. They are all nice guys, in their own little ways-- some more sincere and decent than others (different story) 
     But after reading it I guess im just ready to look them all in the face and think ""Ha, thanks for caring enough not to crush the fantasy you knew i was thinking of."" and others i still sometimes want to punch, for knowing me like they did and knowing if i could see the truth to the situation id change it--but allowing me to be that stupid anyway. 
    But it was my choice, all along it was mine. And Im far from heartbroken. Yeah, theres probably only been one guy thats ever actually cared about me and he wasnt mentioned and maybe he should have been...but thats the only one I have regrets about so that story remains untouched. 
     He Just Wasnt into Me... there's a concept...he can kiss me...not be into me...he can spend time with me, go on dates with me...not be into me... so how do you you know? I mean, how do I plan to find a guy? I probably wont...at least not for a long time..but (finally) at least that one will be happy he gets the letters I write, gets to have conversations with me, wants to date me, listens to my randomness...and soaks it up. I dont even know if thats possible -- but frankly I can make him up-- b/c Mr. I'm Perfect for You and You Dreamt Me Up is 100% into me...b/c i said so"

"event","Yay, so I am utterly amazed at my ability to actually not be upset about things i should be upset about. I dont get into my first choice college under early decision so i have to wait another like 3 months to know if i got in and make new plans. And honestly I wasnt upset i mean at all. Like... yeah it changes my plans but hey...things happen...life will go on. Evidentally i dont think  life will go on when i mess up an exam but it will for a major stepping stone in my life...hmmm... reasoning? lol 
    And im amazed at how though i say i dont really care about boys and i dont cry about them or get upset-- and how sometimes i think im putting on a show when i say that -- im really not...Its been proven over and over again--I have no heart for that sort of thing. Like I can be mildly disappointed...and thats it. There's really no heartbroken or lovesick thing with me. It doesnt fit. Im good at just dealing with it and going on with my business. My only fear is that someday someone's going to throw something at me and I am going to be shattered. I dont do shattered, but sometimes i think itd be nice to meet someone who makes me feel that way. I just feel like these minor disappointments(guys) along the way are fillers. I dont do fillers- id rather be lonely than that-- time wasted. 
    So yeah...side-tracked perhaps...disappointed maybe...broken? Can't happen- try again please :)"

"event","I think i can actually feel time passing by me now. So much has happened in the last year, let alone, the last four. There are some friendships that I had that will never be the same-- and some friendships that I made that I will never be the same because of...(see chris shepler :)  ) 
I mean are there these people out there, just waiting to be part of our lives?... they trickle in slowly and one by one change the view of everything. They make it gorgeous, or scary, painful, fun, beautiful...
I love theme nights and I think of anything Ill remember from this time in my life it will be key club and those damn theme nights. Theres something amazing about being friends with the same girls you watched learn to tie thier shoes... and boys for that matter. 

This weekend Disney took over the Monster Mash...unknowingly. Ho-hantas, Ho-White, and Moo-lan came. and we kicked ass, though we didnt feel like molesting guy's(that we dont have any interest in) crouches...the night was fun. red sox won...night over"

"event","So yesterday there was a meltdown... not gonna lie... i didnt know what to do but panic. Im just nervous over college admissions b/c i dont want to say i want to get into my top schools and not-- i dont want to go there and fail -- i dont want to choose the wrong one-- i dont want to leave everyone-- i dont want to say the wrong thing in an essay or put the wrong number of leadership positions. I dont want to be disappointed in what i turn out to be. Even though ive tried my hardest, im embarrassed now. I wish i was smarter ( so badly) i wish i was more charming and charismatic ( like mt :)   ), i wish i was in the position where i knew what i was going to get and i loved it. And im just sorting through some stuff with my grandfather and some of my friends and other things. and wondering why i choose to act like i dont care about any of them. 
When frankly i do.. i really care that i dont see brit and rebecca, i really care that i dont have the nerve to see my grandfather, i really care that i feel like crap b/c i cant sleep and cant remember things, i really care that my brother is less than i am in life, and i really care that i think i could really have a connection with someone and i have to ignore it for them and even more b/c i dont want them to think they can hurt me-- even when its obvious to everyone but me that it would take nothing...has taken nothing in fact... b/c as breans profile states ""you can only get hurt if you actually care"" well guess what... i care, and it sucks and next time ill remember to tell people ""not good,"" snippily (i might add) if they ask ""what our chances are"" -- b/c our chances are that you will decide that you dont want me and have sex with some other girl and ill accept it and pretend like i dont care once again( big surprise) and then we'll be these awkward friends.. but only not to them.. clearly im the only who thinks that its weird...and then ill have to write a million college application essays about the beauty of my youth and my past experiences-- knowing all the while that the cynical view thats about to come pouring from my pen would surely scratch my name off the list faster than flies on...something sweet. err-- and then i sit at the end of this and think how trivial it all is-- and the beauty of my youth is exactly what it would always have to be-- the beauty of youth, is its incredibly erasable existance and its timely passing.. and oddly enough the irreplaceable fun that goes along with it."

"event","I love the feeling of knowing you're a different person b/c of some experience- but being able to hold onto and go back to what you were before. 
I have had an awesome summer meeting new people and gaining a new best friend (joeface you are soo pretty!) and getting to know the board and seeing things and growing up. And Ill be alittle bit different because of each thing i experienced. each one of them changed me. but im still me. Im an older, slightly ditzier, (perhaps) better decision maker than i was. i love summer b/c you walk into it with all these expectations of relaxation and possible summer relationships and expected exercize programs-- and walk out a tired, single, perhaps rounder person than you walked in-- and you would never change it. b/c in the end it's you. 

sometimes you need to make some wrong decisions to figure out what you are and what you mean to yourself. and sometimes you need to make them just to be stupid. and thats the great part of summer-- not everyone saw you fall flat on your face, it allows you a cushion to protect yourself. 
Ive learned to be more open with my love for those that mean something to me. b/c even though i always felt it, i rarely said it aloud. and its given me some time to better prioritize things-- some of which i still need to see through-- some of which i still need to find the courage to see through ( im sorry pop pop)
Ill miss the person i got to be for three months- but ive already missed the person i always was. summer isnt a break from school, its a break from you-- your responsibilities, your personality, your family, your friends...

its a time of freedom, exploration, and possibilties-- all of which are what you make of them. 
im so thankful for the things ive experienced, and even more thankful for that three month cushion that kept me in tact throughtout all of it."

"event","i hate myself alittle b/c the things ive been worrying about for the past two days arent things that belong in my personality or life. i avoid drama and real anxiety and actual existance at all costs and they hit me in the face. and honestly i just want to say ""do you know, do you even care, does it count, is THAT it?"" but i will never do that b/c i hate myself for having to want to ask those, im so much smarter than lying to my parents and im so much smarter than randomly wanting to be with someone whose feelings i dont understand and, in honesty, question. but i want to. and thats what this is about.
Vantage point kind of changes everything. i question myself on how i feel. on how i actually feel. b/c with this i do. no fake emotion no plastered on smile no feeling one way b'c its ""right."" sometimes you just feel yourself...actually living. and you feel whatever you want and it doesnt matter any more that you actually are you. it doesnt matter anymore what you were even feeling-- just that you were. you're not afraid to be.
you're terrified.
and at that moment so many thing goes into question. and the initial thing that made the difference doesnt even match up to the things you found out about yourself-- it doesnt even compare with the other parts of you and your emotions that appeared. 
i feel deep if i feel at all. and i thought i was real before...
i guess life makes you just find out things at random times.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance: id like to be learning how some girls like themselves so much, learning how Heather fixes her hair in the morning to look great everyday, learning to be what you actually want to be , learning to say no, learning to draw lines, learning to understand where people are coming from, laughing, talking to some of the people i enjoy speaking with, admitting i cant do everything, finding someone to do everything with, id like to learn how to milk cows, id like to watch fireworks, go sailing, go fishing, go hiking, go camping, go to the beach, learning to parallel park, riding a motorcycle(ref. to quinn), learning to play the piano, learning to dance, learning to let myself dance, learning to make funnier faces, learning to throw away all mirrors, learning to bake, learning to cook, learning to run countless miles like rebecca, learning to take a breath, learning to let people let me take a breath, learning to not freak out when i feel emotions, growing up, learning what a breast stroke actually is, learning to depend on people, knowing how to count un my head( this includes multiplication and division), learning the declaration of independence, studying mythology, understanding mythology, finally being able to use my tarot cards, learning to paint, becoming a carpenter, becoming a ping pong champion, being a missionary, learning to put myself last, learning to not always put myself last, reading the bible, reading the dictionary, and finishing the last Harry Potter....but hey, those 15 seconds add up, better get on those...</P>"

"event","Ok, so I want someone to walk with. Like in the evening when you're bored and you just want someone there so you dont have to walk alone. And you see all these older couples walk past...walking together... and you think, wow they have a walking partner. There's no insecurities for them-- im betting even if they are in the biggest fight... they will take their normal everyday lap around the neighborhood, and you know why? b/c they know, they have someone to walk with them. I go through a million crushes, I tend to get hung up on some of them- guarantee-- but there are several. And the ones i hang on to, are ones I never picture myself actually being with-- b/c i dont actually in reality want to be with them. I like to think that Im normal, but its simply not true. But i dont think I want to be with someone. Im scared-- of a million things. So i pick these guys who will never see what they want in me -- or if they do,I make myself lose sight of all the things i saw in them. I ruin anything that could provide me with a walking partner... and all because I dont trust it. I dont trust what other people feel and dont let myself let go and just be happy. Im an ""analyzer."" Which also means, I think about everything right down to the part where it starts to not make sense-- stops being fun-- stops making me happy. I need to quit analyzing; i need to let go; i need to find me something...someone that i trust with my feelings... b/c, im guessing they simply havent come along. I need to find a walking partner."

Its this damn key club stuff thats crazy- and its only b/c i get too involved in stuff and it takes over my life and i love it and when it goes away i pretty much die. Just wait, next year, i think the entire second semester will be like today. I wont stop crying, b/c then ill have to give up people-- and people just become you, or my friends have -- and wow...crying right now... but its just, how can you walk away from people that have been your life; they're your past your memories -- some people are everything-- and then nothing all at once. I love you guys so much, i mean, there havent been any people that love me and have touched me and make me laugh and be alive the way you do. every one of you is amazing.

  So I was thinking today, while sitting in journalism doing nothing constructive, we dont really see people when we look at them. You cant see them, until you know something they're going through,or have gone through--until you understand and see emotions they are feeling, just by watching them-- until you watch them become nervous around some one, or smile while looking at another person, or cry. People around you are like scenery, noticed and recognized but their exact placement and purpose never understood thoroughly. 
      people are beautiful, if they did nothing but breath, they would breathtaking, nothing but believe, they would be unbelieveable b/c they are real...concrete emotions. So, as it goes, a ""closer glance"" wont cut it-- you'll miss the very thing that makes people... themselves. Open your eyes and question yourself; am I just looking at it, or am i seeing it?"

But yeah... b/c you're putting together all these things and people and events and feelings-- and all those things have to fit just right or the puzzle doesnt work out. you group all the similar things together and then go on and branch out to new groups and new shapes and pieces of the picture. finally, on day youll look and think wow how did i get here-- i guess i just hope i can still connect those pieces years from now-- when the edges are bent, and life has dealt its heavy blows. hmmm.. life   --ill write later...not about puzzles... but about my panic attack today, bye"

"event","I got this b/c everyone gets one and they write all this stuff in them about what they do and how they feel, and frankly, I'm going to write about being crazy and how sometimes being crazy isnt all its cracked up to be. sometimes you want to beat someone's head in for just smiling wrong, sometimes you ponder the significance of two weeks, sometimes you want to jump on something while throwing many many rocks at someone's face-- but sometimes you just want to love them, and can't-- b/c you're crazy. If i could talk about greg i would(cue heartbreaking). If i could explain quinn id try(see: confusion). if i could know what i wanted and not be petrified of it id go after it(think never), but...those all begin with if's-- b/c im not strong enough and i dont want to be able to, strike that, cant carry those things around with me. B/c the weight would crush my man shoulders and break my tree trunk legs. wow...i like this."

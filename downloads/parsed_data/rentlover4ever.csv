"event","On Feb 8th I went to Anthony Rapp's booksigning and I took my best friend Melissa with me. He read a chapter from his wonderful book Without You. He answered some questions, includeing mine which was ""Do you ever get stagefright."" Also he sang Seasons of Love which was breathtaking! 
Off to the signing. We only had to wait about an half hour in line considering we were pretty close to where he was set up at. When we were right next to where he was I got that nervous thing again. Melissa went first because she wanted to and because we both thought she would be more calm then I was. How wrong we were. She was so nervous worse then I was and rightly so! Its one thing to sit in a chair and watch him from two rows but a total different experience to stand inches away from him. When I got up there I thought I was going to pass out. But he looked up at me smiled and said hi. I know this will sound strange but his very kind voice just calmed me down. Its like he knew I was nervous beyond belief. Which Im sure he did considering when I asked him a question from before I was shaking like a leaf. I said hi back and I said, How are you. He stopped signing for a second looked up again smiled and said Great thanks for asking. He signed my book and my cd. After he signed them he said Well thank you for coming and listening to me talk and sing. And I said no wait picture! 

I stood next to him and he leaned in closer and there you go! Thats where my beautiful picture came from! Melissa stood next to the nice man with my camera and took a pic with hers. I said thank you again. He turned to look at me and said, Thanks again. I looked at him and said Thank you so much for everything. He smiled again and nodded. 

Im sure he didnt get my exact meaning of the everything part. But thats ok. I didnt only mean thank you for signing my stuff but for everything. Meaning to be honest I havent been so happy in a long time. Since I found out who he was and I started reading about him. I have admired him so much, and after this, after reading his book and meeting him I admire him so much more. He writes so honestly and just spills his heart out. Some of the things he went through I have been through at certain points, and to know that he has gotten over those things just idk makes it easier. I look up to him in so many different ways. He was so kind to his fans at the signing, when there were times that I wouldnt have blamed him if he got annoyed with some of us, including me. But he treated all of us with such kindness he was just wonderful in everyway. The pictures that I took do not even come close to show how cute, beautiful, wonderful, and special he truly is. I havent been this happy in a very long time, and I want to thank Anthony from the bottom of my heart. I hope he realizes how much he has changed so many lives for the better. Also Im so proud of him! His book is sold out in 5 stores around where I live and 3 out where the signing was! This was seriously the best day of my life. This proves that Happiness is not finding a pencil, Happiness is not even finding a book, Happiness is when all your dreams come true. And in more ways than one that happened that day. Thank you Melissa for going with me. If you didnt I dont know what would have happened. I most likely would have been passed out on the floor even before the signing started. Thank you so much you have no idea how much that meaned to me! 

Thank you too my parents who agreed to take us both to the signing even though I knew they really didn't want to.

Thanks once again to Anthony who is seriously the most caring wonderful individual I have ever met."

"event","It's been a long time, and I wanted you to know I'm still among the living.  My six months are finished in Oxford.  My work visa expired and I had to escape the country and return this week as a 'tourist'.  Crazy international laws these Brits have.  Well, I've been quite sad my time is over in England...and have been moaping in mass.  I have the gait and posture of a wooke.  Other than that, I went to an awesome party last night...till 6 in the mornin.  It was mostly musicians, so there was amazing music..live music...much guitar passing around.  It was beautiful.  I learned of lots of new bands, and Brit classics I never knew of...Like Nick Drake, if you like acoustic check up on his work.  He only made 3 cds before his death...but they're wonderful.  Jenny and I move out of the flat this Saturday, and will be going around Europe until we come home.  I'll be back in the States May 25th.  By then, for your sake I hope to look more like a normal human than Mr. Chewy."

"event","Went with Jenny to watch Premonition.  I was rallying to watch 300, especially since many of you have seen it and given good reviews, plus I love Frank Miller, but you can guess how much success I had to win that over for me watching the thing with my one-n-only partner in crime abroad...(it didn't).  So I endured what might have been an appealing movie had it been better written or contained any discernible purpose for having been created.  No character development.  At some points I was hoping the characters would die just to get it over with.  It is basically Final Destination 672 with a great actress playing an underdeveloped role.  Also a child's face gets mangled.  Thumbs down.  See Denzel in Deja Vu if you crave this sort of drama, it's much better and makes you care about the characters.  Movie poster is cool artwork, but makes no sense with the contents of the flim...except creepy birds in trees.  Look forward to sneaking away with Craig to see 300 at any cost."

"event","Work ended early for me today (at the temp job stuffing envelopes), I got things done a day earlier/faster than anyone expected, so i'm out of work until a few scheduled days next week.  Spirits are very high however.  I feel so much love and support from friends at home, and family too, that it keeps me goin.  Thanks to these people, things are going to be alright...better than alright...six months is longer than you imagine.  I would have died had I not seen Mary, thank God she popped over.  Chad and Jonathon online have been amazing.  Maybe I can see Rick in Germany or him here.  That would def be a highlight on this adventure.  
When I come back and see everyone again, I want to do group activities like camping, Six Flags, and road trips to the unimaginables for doing, of course, the unimaginable/unpredictable...per usual...Until then, I feel supported from every contact from home, and appreciate and give thanks to every ounce of encouragement that Mary, Jonathon, Chad, Michael, The Compound, C&E, and Cinda, among loving others, have selflessly contributed
it keeps me strong, thanks and much much love to you"

"event","Everything unexpectedly changed last week.  My temp job 'let me go' and my mode of transportation (pretty little mountain bike) was stolen.  I also became fever stricken and forced to lie in bed more than four days.  I lost my job, my bike, my health and, incidentally, my mind on a consecutive Tuesday.  Following the decline of my fever, my spirits dropped--smack hit rock bottom.  I was well enough to take on another temp job.  It was of mind-numbing proportion---I sat alone at a desk in a huge cubical office.  My task was to use a black marker to go through mountains of old binders and cross-out credit card numbers for a huge publishing company.  All the files were old, so the cards had all expired anyway.  Still, it was for cold cash, and cash keeps me warm and fed and livin the dream...

Four days of being high on marker, however much against my will-I was definitely high from the time I got to work till I went to sleep at night (and had nose bleeds to boot due to no ventilation), I had an upside-down awakening.  Somewhere between Lennon's ""Imagine"" and ""The Immigrant Song"" playing in my ears, as my mind reeled in numbness on my shift, I turned upside down my plans for life, or rather, decided to follow my passions a little differently in regard to the rest of my life.  I am thinking about being a radical, a social activist, a full-time social justice fighter.  Counseling is still a great love of mine, and still might be my career, but as of this moment I am considering becoming a social justice advocate and leader as the fore-running vocation.

 
Here's what I put in my journal on lunch break:
The job isn't bad bc I get time to think.  When I think, I think about the most important thing to me - people, I think of the injustices of the world- in the US and outside it.  When I think, I get angry, with anger comes restlessness.  Maybe I won't be a counselor for the abused, but a more preventative force.  Maybe I should step-up my plans for grad. school and become a stronger activist than I have been planning.  I'm so outraged and yet ignorant.  I need to educate myself on social justice issues.  Now I'm considering changing my career/life plans.  Maybe I could be a voice for victims instead of a comfort.  Either way, I need to be effective and have found that through this time of 'uselessness' (job void of meaning) I am reflecting and transforming the realisations of my passions and convictions on my un-distracted mind.  

At home I always stay busy, busy, busy, busy. Maybe I was unconsciously blocking all this anger for the maltreatment of so many people.  Even though I was involved in some protests and trips to South America, my witness eyes held their scenes until my mind was free from stupid obligations I disillusion myself with in my home life.  Now I'm seeing everything again, and reliving my experiences with people who are treated unfairly.  I desperately want to be involved to become both aware and active for positive change.  I'm glad to say that today was my last day at that job.  While I'm jobless, I still have hope.  I have taken the edge off the intense frustration I felt earlier today when I was thinking about Guatemala and the poor and the lower class all around us, but I'm still angry.  I'm angry enough to be eager and anxious.  I pray for God to center me and give me direction and courage.  This time abroad has been used for positive self-reflection...my passions are flowing from my heart like sweat from skin pores... and I know my mind has more to come forward."

"event","Hey ladies and gentlemen, I became very angry today upon the realization that there is a common believe about gender that women are less capable, deserving, and credible than men.  So under the full Winter moon, and in a clear state of anger, I propose a bra burning upon my return to the States.  

Honestly, I am so angry I am physically agitated: my heart rate is up and my hands are wringing and hot.  I am angry that people are not seen as people, but are held to the light and judged by what sexual organs they possess.  What is infuriating is that both men and women feel that women are lesser than men.  It is disadvantageous for women, as a part of the gender they have been identified with, to carry the opinion that women are not equals to men.  That is what also makes me angry, women do it to themselves just as much as the part of the male gender that stands to benefit from this line of opinion.  The weak-minded women who encourage the ideology, both in personification and through open opinion, are bending themselves to suffer the consequences and as a direct result; they also make it worse for women of independence to operate in society.

Anyone who knows me would say that I am an independent person.  I should be free in my life to pursue the benefits of equality regardless of my gender.  I want to purse an education and attain a career that is fitting to my dreams.  I aspire to be a advocate for social justice, to earn a doctorate, to have a family, and to leave this world a little better than I found it.  Why should it matter that I am a woman?  Is it not more important that I am a motivated and determined person?  Is it fair that I will suffer the prejudices of family, friends, co-workers, educators, and the male dating population because of my success?  Specifically from all these angles, I have received the message that because of gender biased beliefs that women are less than men, I will continue to suffer being a woman because it is a social disability.

Damn, where is ARETHA?  What I'm going to do about is carry on.  What ignited this fire is not as important as all the brush I have collected over the years that are burning because of it.  I'm going to be an independent woman.  I'm going to be a social justice advocate, have a doctorate, rear a family, and start a legacy, because damn it I deserve every bit I fight for in this world.  So if you're a respectable person and can handle this, please continue to fight the good fight.  Word.  Get your lighters ready.

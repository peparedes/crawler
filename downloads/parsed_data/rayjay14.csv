"event","""Hmmm...that's never happened before...."" Not exactly something you want to hear as your dentist pulls the drill away from your wisdom tooth being removed. ""How did that happen?"" asked the nurse. ""Maybe I bumped into a switch or something."" suggested the dentist. I began smelling the most horrible burning smell I've ever smelled in my life and I noticed little particles of tooth floating around in front of the really bright light. It was no big deal, apparently the drill wasn't squirting waterlike it's supposed to. ""It's probably the patient's fault."" The dentist joked revealing his sense of humor. After the first two were removed they waited about a half hour until the bleeding was under control so they could start the other side. In the meantime I got to lay there watching MTV trying to make sure I didn't bite my tongue off due to lack of feeling in my mouth. The next two came out even easier and there was no pain at all. I was given a prescription for vicoden and was warned to take them before the novacaine wore off. I waited for my mom to come get me as the precious minutes slipped by after the extraction. Finally she pulled up and payed the extra charge and was given the prescription and yadda yadda yadda...time was slipping by...we drove to CVS in blue point. On the way there Matt called me and I told him maybe we could ""go see hawwy pottew latew on."" He mocked me and asked me if I had seen ""shwek twoo."" I was laughing really hard and had to hang up. We got to the pharmacy and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes for them to fill it. I walked around CVS nervously until I realized I had to replace the gauze because it had been well over a half hour. It was really gross and bloody but the worst part is the Novacaine started to wear off just as I replaced it and I started feeling extreme pain. I was shaking and trying to relax all the way home and had to use a straw to drink the water to swallow the Vicoden when I got home. The pain lingered for a while but slowly dulled after I took the pills. I bled all night and actually ran out of gauze around midnight and tried to fall asleep sitting up to slow the bleeding. I woke up from a semi sleep at 4am in really bad pain and took to more pills which finally knocked me out. This morning I woke up with a mouth full of dried blood which was really gross. All in all, it's a shitty experience, but the pain isn't that intense. I found my wallet too, so things are looking up."

"event","college provides me with all sorts of material to write about. the people, the places, the alchohol. being home is great. it's relaxing and i'm surrounded by the people i've known all my life. but it doesn't make for frequent journal entries. so i'm gonna do the best i can. 
 
  Highlights since getting home not in chronological order-

 Fishing illegaly in Canaan lake. Getting pulled over for running a stop sign and simply being told to slow down. Inventing the ""Bible on tape"" drinking game. Blacking out in Brendans basement and waking up in my own bed, thanks lou! Returning to work at Smith Point and not being a gopher anymore. Playing my dad and a drunk Steve Wrinkle in Mario Golf and having Casey turn off the game cube on the 18th hole. Not tipping the waiter at Applebees and then realizing I may have left my wallet there...anybody seen my wallet? Learning to play poker. Learning to hate poker. 

Tomorrow the wisdom teeth come out. I hear that feels really good. Can't wait. Gonna go sleep for the last time with wisdom teeth EVER.....unless you count getting knocked out. 

        I'll probably write about it in the future."

"event","Joe and Steve giggle all the way down the hallway as we carry our 12 packs of Bud right out in the open with no one to stop us. ""I can't believe it."" Steve says, as visions of security guards and strict RAs come flashing back from his strict Sacred Heart past. ""This would just be a waste of alchohol at my college."" says Joe. ""They would make us pour it out and throw away the empty bottles."" ""Well, what do you expect? This is Hofstra."" Says Mike Lafemina overhearing us from his room. Steve, Joe and I cracked open a few beers and played drinking darts. Steve quit when he realized he was absolutely horrible and according to my rules would have to chug like 2 beers every round. Joe and I continued on while Steve put on the last Samurai and made a mess out of my room with Pretzel Stix which he stole from me. 
Canada eventually signed online and Joe typed to him ""We want to play beer pong.""
""Oh"" A drunk Canada just back from happy hour responded. A minute and a half went by........         ""Come on Over.""
We told Scott we were gonna go play beer pong and it didn't take us long to pack up the leftover beer and head over there, but by the time we had gotten there Canada was passed out in his bed with his clothes on again. I had to do it again. See here!( http://community.webshots.com/photo/143031872/143032398NqjCOs )
Many games of beer pong were played...Things get hazy. Someone suggested, or insisted that we go to Popeyes, i think it was Scott. On the way out apparently I tackled steve and we got into an altercation, during which I lost my sandal. We settled down and I continued walking, trying to find out who had my sandal. Scott carried it covertly and Joe told him to do something funny with it. Joe thought he would throw it in the street and I would chase after it to my death, apparently this is funny to Joe, but Scott had a better idea and threw it over the tall iron post fence surrounding the Netherlands. Upon seeing my sandal out of my grasp I insisted that someone help me go get it and instantly began blaming Wrinkle for throwing it over. Wrinkle tried to help me but he was too drunk. I yelled at him all the way to Popeyes and even after we got inside for throwing it over. ""I didn't do it...I didn't, I swear I didn't."" But I was so diligent that the poor drunk bastard finally confessed to Scott's crime and sincerely apologized for having done such a thing. We were sitting there devouring our chicken when we noticed three girls just coming in from the bar. I recognized one of them as my beer pong(or beruit as she would call it) partner from a house party a couple of weeks earlier. Having less inhibitions than I normally would I went over to strike up a conversation, but they just wanted to know why I was only wearing one sandal.
I must have made some sort of good impression because they came back to play beer pong with us. As we passed the sandal on the way back I had scott help me up and I dove onto the wet grass right next to it from the extremely tall iron fence. Joe and I played a few games with Katie and Sarah who turned out to be from Boston and had the cool accents while Scott talked to Christine. Wrinkle was MIA after an incident in the bathroom which left him unpresentable to make a public appearance. As the girls were leaving I gave Katie a paper that said ""Your #1 Beer Pong Partner"" with my screen name and cell number. Much to my surprise she actually Imed me the other day and I might play beer pong with them again on a table they recently stole from the student center(gotta love Hofstra). Anyway, after the girls left Scott got going but me, Joe and Steve stuck around until all the beer in Matty's 18 pack was finished. We're such troopers. I don't remember getting back to Liberty but apparently when we did Wrinkle threw up. Poor kid, rough night. I woke up the next morning with a Joe on my floor, my contact lenses stuck to the side of the case (see here! http://community.webshots.com/photo/143031872/143032427DDlTQM ) and went to my last Saturday class of computer math with a smile on my face."

"event","When you're writing a journal entry the body of the entry is entitled ""Event:"". It should be called, ""Oh god what the hell did you do now, RJ?"" It was a good week for drunken RJ. He got to come out alot and wreak havoc on the world. Last monday I invented a drinking game by myself where everytime something cool happened in terminator 2, I would drink. Terminator 2 is a really cool movie. Tuesday night Mchebes had an open bar from 9-11. Me and Matty played some beer pong beforehand and were in line at 8:45 before anyone was there. I won't bore you with the list of what I drank, but by 1:30 the place was so crowded me and Matty left and said goodbye to Lisa, Maggie, Jen, and Lenny and headed over to Popeyes to buy a crapload of chicken. We went back to Matt's room and ate while yelling at Canada in the other room for not going. He called me a jibroni or something so I threw the tartar sauce we were dipping the chicken in through the doorway and onto his bed. To retaliate he threw it back through the doorway onto the wall and his suitcase. Me and Matt played some more beer pong and I left after Matt proved himself impervious to my beer pong skills. I walked to Kate and Willy's to buy an appetizer sampler and they saw how drunk I was and gave me a shitload of pretzels because the didn't want to throw them out. I took them back to the dorm and went around knocking on doors trying to give out pretzels. Nobody wanted pretzels at god knows what time in the AM they just wanted their precious sleep. Goddamn pussies. I went to Jeff's room to enjoy my sampler. I enjoyed some of it and threw some of it at Jeff and Devin. Jeff told me to leave and I said ""Hey you don't have to hint at it just come out and say it.""
Jeff informed me that he wasn't hinting and he wanted me to leave. I stood up to leave forgetting that the sampler was resting on my lap and spilled it all over the floor. ""I'm so sorry. Let me clean this up.""        ""Get out.""
Wednesday night SGT came to Hofstra which was awesome. They played alot of new songs that I had never hear before, some that were amazing. Thursday night I was writing a paper until Jen convinced me to go over to the Netherlands for a little while. We polished off the left over beer in about 2 minutes and me lenny and jen went out for more. At a stoplight me and Lenny watched a girl throw up into a 7 eleven slurpee cup. We thought it was pretty amazing, but Jen wasn't impressed. When we got back I decided to show off my bottle bong by doing one in-between games of beer pong, which me and Declan were winning very consistently. After about 10 games Canada came out of the bedroom and stared out into space. ""Canada, what are you doing?"" ""I was....looking at Lenny."" Lenny shot back ""No you weren't you were staring at Jen's vagina."" ""Yeah right...cause THAT would turn me on."" Declan and I played some more beer pong against the SAMMY's from the suite and won. They retired into their room to smoke their problems away. Canada went into his bedroom and passed out on the bed. I took a silver marker and put lines across his face and gave him lines on his cheeks and forhead that made him look like an Indian and then a goatee that made him look like a villainous Indian. At some point I lost my sandal and looked all over the suite for it. I bursted into Dan's room and started yelling at everyone. ""Gimme my fuckin sandal back!"" an incredibly high Dan was highly amused by this. ""We don't have your sandal."" I was even angrier now. ""Gimme it back or I'll fuckin kill you!""
He laughed. ""We ate it."" ""What?...I'll fucking kill you!"" ""We had a sandal sandwich.""
We never found it so I left with Declan wearing one sandal. We went into Dutch treats and back to my room with one sandal. I wrote a journal entry at 3:39 am which was really wierd and and I'm glad Mcfadden told me about it the next day so I could delete it. Friday I saw Man on Fire which was good, and stayed sober. Last night I went to a party in Mineola with Scott and Baker. I finished a 40 in my room while watching the end of The Matrix reloaded and Scott drove us to this really cool apartment on top of a hair salon near the Mineola train station. There were alot of people there that I semi-recognized and I had a great time playing beer pong and flip cup and drinking the 40's we brought. Eventually people started goin out the windows onto the roof of the hair salon. I went out and saw everyone smoking and was about to leave when some kid I didn't know called my name and told me to come look over the balcony. There I saw one of the wierdest things I've ever seen. A man in a black suit with a red tie and black sneakers with red trim was pushing wile steering a Black VW cabrio (with red trim) across the street into a different parking spot. It blew my mind. I went back inside and played flip cup some more. Someone had left a bottle of grey goose on the tabke so I poured a cup of it and drank it. ""That's not yours."" someone said. I just laughed and walked away. Someone claims to have seen me sleeping on the stairway up to the apartment, but at some point I became worried about Scott driving me back to Hofstra after drinking and smoking and I began to take the long trek back on foot. I walked and walked until I found myself disoriented in the Garden City suburbs. I pulled out my cell phone and called Wrinkle. I explained to him my situation and he offered to help. ""Hold on I have another call."" I switched lines and Scott was yelling at me asking where the hell I was. ""I'm...I'm at the corner of Washington and Wyatt."" ""Stay there."" I was in the middle of a two way street when Scott uttered these memorable words. I switched back to Wrinkle and updated him. I stood on the double yellow line as a few cars sped by and honked at me but none of them were Scott. ""Fuck this. I'm not standing in the middle of the road anymore."" I told Wrinkle, and continued walking. Wrinkle was trying to find my location on Mapquest when Scott pulled up next to me and told me to get in. I hung up on Wrinkle and dove in to the car. I was yelling directions at Scott. ""NOO, Northwest to capus we goin Southeasterly you're never gonna make it this way!!"" When we got back Scott pulled in and I jumped out of the car onto the hood of a little white car. That's when I went nuts. ""AHH. I hate this car!"" I ran into the bushes and jumped out of them at Scott and Baker. ""AHH!"" I ran through the security booth while swiping and bounced off the walls to my room. When I got there I ran down the hall tearing shit off of people's doors. ""AHH!"" I went to John's door and started banging on it. He didn't answer it, instead he banged back to anger me. Nate came out from across the hall and told me to shut the fuck up. ""You shut the fuck up cause John won't answer his fuckin door!"" Scott and Baker tried to get me into my bed with no success, but Nick got a picture of us. See here! (http://community.webshots.com/photo/143031872/143032416pFiFcd). ""I'm gonna go to Kate and Willy's!....get some food."" I sprinted down the hallway out of their grasp. Scott and Baker found me in Dutch treats purchasing a sandwich and some water. When I woke up this morning Matt informed me that I had apparently done another depressing journal entry which was instantly deleted. If you ever read any of those it's just drunk RJ being an idiot. I hope this one was entertaining."

"event","You all remember my late night escapade with the seinfeld tape and the water at the beginning of first semester? Well I recently learned that what keeps you from walking around and talking when you're dreaming is the secretion of a hormone that temporarily paralyzes all your muscles. Sleep walking is the result of a failure to excrete these hormones. It's even possible to wake up and know you're awake but not be able to move or open your eyes because of the hormones, and this is called sleep paralysis. Well the other night I went to sleep mildly intoxicated and Nick said I started mumbling and seemed like I was trying really hard to tell him something but couldn't, and then I burst out laughing while rolling over extremely slow. It is my hypothesis that alchohol messes up this process of paralysis, which can be dangerous to yourself and your roomates videotapes. The moral of the story is don't drink and dream.  

This morning I opted not to go to class and catch up on some sleep. I had one of those dreams that seems so real you feel like you're awake. I was in my dorm and all these people were in my room and my hallway, some that I knew from highschool, some from college, and some that I didn't know at all. I counted them, there were 18 people in my tiny room. I told them to get out but they were all talking to eachother and ignoring me so I went out in the hallway to get away from them. The hallway was filled with even more people, some from my family and a buch of other random people. Wrinkle came up to me and proposed that we hold a beer pong tournament in my room and I liked this idea. I filled up the green cup on my desk with a cold one and went to get wrinkle in the hallway. When I found him he was talking to his mother and father. His mother asked me what I was drinking. ""Is that..BEER?"" I assured her it wasn't and walked away. I went to dutch treats (the deli across the street) for some bread or something, and ran into my mother, grandpa and grandma. My grandparents were confused as always and grandpa said ""RJ! We didn't expect to see you in here!"" My mother rolled her eyes and said ""Come on Dad, you know RJ goes to school here."" My phone rang and Felice's auto garage were trying to tell me something about my car (which is currently in their shop) but the static was really bad. I went back to the dorm and there was only like 5 people still in the room. I went back out in the hallway and much to my confusion it was decked out like a five star hotel. Green marble floors, gold lamps on the ornate walls, plants and furniture decorating the hallway. I walked to the end of it and found myself in a huge lobby with a glass cieling. I could see through this cieling that the building had four new stories that weren't there before. I knew that it was physically impossible for this building to be rebuilt like this in a matter of minutes, and it was at this point that I came to the realization that I was asleep and this was a dream. It's quite an exciting revelation, believe me.
 I ran down the hallway to tell my mom. When I told her she looked at me like I was crazy. I had her follow me into the lobby where I threw my cell phone against the wall as hard as I could. I then held out my hand and watched the phone repair itself and float into my hand. She was convinced. It seemed I had the power to control small things around me, but my surroundings were still being controlled by my subconscious. I wanted to explore these surroundings some more now that I knew they were not real. I walked out of the lobby into the street and everyone was speaking Italian. I concluded that I was in Rome and made my way down the street. Drunk with power I walked over to a man selling vegetables and proceeded to beat the crap out of him with his own products. After smashing a tomato on the non-existent man's face he pulled out a shotgun. I did not want to go walking around Rome with a shotgun wound to the chest, so again using my jedi-like powers I toook the shotgun away from him and shot him in the forehead with a blast of air that knocked him unconscious. I then burned down his vegetable stand, just cause I knew it wasn't real and I thought it would be funny. Somehow I ended up back in my dorm sitting down playing video games when Nick came in and introduced me to a beautiful girl and just my luck, I woke up."

"event","Where was I? Thursday...Ahhh yes, so Wrinkle was throwing up in my car and I gave him a plastic bag in the nick of time, causing me to miss the exit for Rt. 112, I cut through the pines over to the Metropolis diner while Wrinkle was begging for me to take him to Wendy's. It's all he would say, ""Can we go to Wendy's? Really I mean I just want to go to Wendy's I don't see why you won't just take me to Wendy's...Really though can we go to Wendy's?"" I told him if he asked me that one more time he was walking home and he didn't say anything the rest of the way to the Metropolis. We met Crissy and Fabian and Nicole Tromello there and I told them about our night. When Steve was looking the other way I poured half of a saltshaker into his water and he turned around and saw what I was doing. ""Don't fuck with me man really don't fuck with me."" He said and started laughing. After about 10 minutes Fabian and the girls left because the girls had to be home. ""Wasn't Crissy here?"" Steve asked me and Matt. ""Yeah, you were talking to her.""
 ""Oh my God. I can't believe we're still at the diner...I thought we were someplace else.""
Steve went in to the bathroom and a few minutes later Matt went in too. Steve came out with water dripping down his nose. ""Did you throw up Steve?"" ""Matt...Matt said I was fine..."" ""Yeah, but did you throw up?"" ""No...Matt said I was fine."" He took a big gulp of water and swallowed. He looked like he just got punched in the stomache. 
After I dropped off Matt I told Steve I was an alien and started making wierd noises. He got upset and told me to stop. I turned the volume knob up all the way and pressed power on. The electric guitar on my Something Corporate Cd blasted midsong and Steve screamed in a high pitch voice. I turned it down and laughed all the way home. 
Friday-Halo at my house...Saturday-Track Meet at Kings Point...Easter....Rochester....Good food....lots of Sleep...Stretch limo from JFK back to hofstra. The End."

"event","Wasn't much of a break, besides from classes. I had practice everyday at 10 so I had to stay at Hofstra for the majority of the week. I ran a 2:14 800 so that was a highlight, and our 4x8 tied the meet record at Wagner. On Monday night we went to this place called Strike in New Hyde Park, where you can bowl unlimited games til 2 for 12 bucks, it's also a bar and we took advantage of this feature. After a few pitchers were gone we decided to try out their go karts. You pay 4$ for your go Kart license and 4$ for each ride. The ride was fun but I like pulling out the little card with a picture of a racecar on it and saying that I'm a racecar driver. 
   On Tuesday I went to NYC with Declan, Jen and Caitlin and we made the poor choice of going to Hempstead instead of Mineola. While looking for our train out on the platform this big black guy came up to Declan and put his arm around him, ""Hoy ya doin brotha, I know you gonna help me out cuz I got a pregnant wife in the car and my car aint got no gas and I just need 10 bucks to get a can of gas, c'mon man."" Declan just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't have any money. ""What about you man?"" He was in my face now, I started looking around for other people but there were none, except for a few people scurrying by who didnt want to know about what was happening to us. ""You gonna help me out right?"" I started thinking... Needs to buy a can of gas? More like a can of drugs. I didn't even lie about not having the money. ""I'm not giving you ten dollars."" He stepped back looking kind of shocked. ""Oh that's fucked up."" This kind of pissed me off ""Not it's not fucked up. I'll give you two dollars."" I took it out and held it out to him. ""No you know what? This is fucked up I aint looking for hand outs."" He turned as if he was going to leave and I put the money back. ""Fine."" I said turning back towards the train. He turned me around again and said ""I'll take five."" Sounded good to me...five dollars and nobody gets hurt. ""Ok, fine."" I took it out and handed it over kind of relieved. ""This is fucked up though."" He said as he took it. We started walking away when I hear Jen say, ""You're fucked up!"" ......Goddammit. 
     ""WHAT?' Who said that, which one of you?"" I put my hands on Jen's shoulders like an older brother would and took advantage of the fact that she looks a lot younger than she is. ""Look she's just a little girl! She doesn't know any better!"" 
 He did not seem appeased but he wasn't marching towards us anymore. ""You know I got a girl your age, you better watch yourself or you're gonna get smacked."" For some reason I didn't doubt he had a girl her age, but I wouldn't call him up for parenting advice. ""Yeah. ok."" Jen said, still acting tough as we walked her away onto the train. Declan and I wiped the sweat off our brows and prepared for an hour on the train listening to Jen complain about what a jerk that guy was and how I shouldn't have given him the five dollars.
   The Met was boring for the most part, but dinner with Renee and her friends at the Bubba Gump Shrimp company was delicious and fun. ""Everything looks really good here. I wish I had more money I'd get it all."" Declan commented looking around at other peoples plates. ""What looks good?"" Caitlin asked staring out the windows into Times square.
""The buildings Caitlin. Declan wants to buy all those buildings."" I said trying to keep from bursting out laughing, but once Declan laughed I couldn't help it. By the way Renee, that waiter was not hitting on me, he just thought I was really smart. That's all.
 We had to wait about an hour in Penn station for our train and Caitlin kept suggesting we take an earlier train to a different station. This would have been a brilliant idea if Declan's car wasn't at Hempstead and we had a car at every other station on Long Island. We explained this problem to her several times but she couldnt quite grasp the concept. 
    When the train arrived I took a nice seat apart from the other three with lots of leg room. ""RJ, you DO know that's priority seating, right?"" Declan asked. I turned around and looked at the little picture of the blue guy in the wheelchair.
""Oh. Don't worry, I'm a very important person.""
""Is that what you'll tell a guy in a wheelchair if he comes on the train?""
""Yes. I'll say...I'm a very important person, and furthermore I'm a racecar driver."" I pulled out the card.
       Wednesday I went to Northport with Mcfadden to his suitemate's house minus the parents. We had to wait a little while for the beer but once it arrived me and Mcfadden dug right in with beer pong and my funnel. After a few hours I was feelin good and we went in the hot tub. I went in in my boxers and when I got out i needed to find something to sleep in. I went to the laundry room and found some athletic shorts that looked promising and a Northport Lacrosse shirt. The shorts felt wierd when I put them on but I didnt care, I went downstairs and passed out on the futon. Matt says he came down about 20 minutes later and poked me until I rolled over and said, ""Matt...You better watch your back, watch your fuckin back!"" and passed out again. The next morning around 11:00 I woke up and realized that the shorts were actually a jockstrap inside mesh shorts. Whoops. I changed into my jeans commando style and followed the snoring sound all the way upstairs to this kid Mike's bedroom. Matt was passed out on a roll out mattress on Mikes floor. I used a gift wrap paper roll to poke matt in the face a few times. His cell phone was in his hand and he opened it and looked at it. ""I'm calling..."" He mumbled, and stood up looking around the room yet somehow not seeing me. He put the phone up to his ear and my cell phone began to ring in my pocket. I held back laughter and answered it. ""Hello?"" He looked at me and put down the phone. His face looked angry and sad at the same time. ""What's goin on?"" He cried as I burst out laughing.
       Thursday Night I was the designated river for Wrinkle and Matt at a party at Monohans friend from Cortland's house near Lake Ronkonkoma. Matt and Wrinkle finished an 18 pack and put a considerable dent in the second pack by the end of the night. While leaving the party Steve asked me, ""Did you get my beer bong?"" (A little contraption that allows you to drink beer faster.) ""Yeah. I got it."" Steve looked mistrustful. ""How do you know?""
""How do i know I got it?!"" I threw it at him. It hit him. ""Do you have yours?"" He asked. I threw mine as well. It hit him as well. to be continued..."

"event","Why? well...blurty is slower, has less options, more problems and has a stupid name. But I stuck with it for better or worse for about half a year, but this morning I went to make an update and it just wasn't there. The whole site i mean, not even a site under construction page. So bye bye blurty. 
      I just got back from the Laguardia where I dropped off my roomate Nick for Easter break, but I still have a freakin class tomorrow and then I go straight to Staten Island to run the 800 at the Wagner Invitational. so..that sucks. last night was fun though, I went over to the netherlands to play beer pong on my new table which I purchased yesterday for my suite next year. It was matts birthday and I ate a piece of cake off a frying pan with no fork, oh we had forks...but I did not require them. Some EAM kids came in later with Adam and Matty's suitemate Dan and they were impressed with the classy funnel I built, so I had to do one to show them how to work the valve of course, one thing leads to another and I'm walking through the security booth in my building with a cup of Yuengling in my hand, a smile on my face and lacking the Jacket I had worn over there, which would have been nice to have on the way to class today. So going through this security booth is the last thing I remember, because I remember the girl insisted I swipe my card instead of just walking through behind Declan. Nick says I came in the room and sat down in the sphere chair to watch Seinfeld with him and I just kept repeating the lines after they were said on the show and laughing. Eventually I passed out and Nick tried to take the beer out of my hand so it wouldnt spill, but couldnt because I had a vice grip on the cup and I woke up and told him he could have the ping pong ball in it but not the beer. there was no ball in the cup but it was a nice gesture I guess. Nicks predictions were correct and after passing out again I spilled the beer all over my shirt. I woke up yet again and ran out of the room, Nick asked me if I was ok and I replied, ""Yeah...it just hurts...""
  I went next door to John and Mike's room where John reminded me to go see my friend Joe about something, but I would not reply with anything coherent for an example John quoted me as saying, ""yeah...you're gonna get educated...""
I woke up with no shirt on, my Id card missing, and an empty beer pong cup on my desk. I knew it had been a good night, but wasnt sure how or where."

"event","So the guy I wrote about last time actually called me.  We were supposed to do something Monday but since one of the other girls didn't show up for the dinner shift I stayed late and covered.  I was too tired to go out so we just hung out a little.  As the week went by I realized he's just not for me.  No, it wasn't the whole preppy thing. lol  He wouldn't stop calling me.  It was almost like every minute of the day he wanted to know where I was.  Too weird for me.  So I officially dumped him tonight."

"event","I just got back from work and holy crap am I tired.  There is a football game today and we actually had a 15 minute wait for tables.  I made decent tips though so I'm happy but I worked my butt off.  I think I'm going to take a nap before going out tonight.  

I decided not to go to that sorority party last night.  Instead I went with Nikole and Kris and a couple other people to a party in this nasty ass apartment building.  I can't believe people live in there.  Yes, it was that nasty. But I met a few cool people and ummm one person in particular that I woke up with this morning. lol  I'm a bad girl.  Wanna spank me?  Actually he did a little.  I'm not much into pain but I like a few smacks on my bottom every now and again. :) 

So, think this guy will call like he said he would?  To be honest I really don't care all that much.  It was fun but the boy has a lot to learn or something.  Plus he's not really my type.  He was good looking but he's too pretty.  lol  Ok well maybe preppy is a better word.  I'm not really into preppy guys.  So we'll see."

"event","I just got back to my apartment from finishing my first week of classes!  I can't believe the amount of work.  I really underestimated.  I might have to tell my jobs to cut my hours.  Money is tight anyway.  This is just going to make it worse. I had to pay my rent yesterday so that's why I'm feeling all down about the situation.  Sorry to bring you down too.   

On a lighter note, I really like my classes.  I have this one math class that just seems impossible but the teacher seems ok so hopefully I'll make it through.  I wanted to be an english major but I actually listened to my dad and and applied and got into a different program.  A more competitive one.  I was told that once you start in liberal arts it's pretty much impossible to get into the controlled majors later on so that's what I did.  I guess I can change my mind later or double major.  I would rather read and write all day.  That's what I love but I guess I'll have to put up with all this math and science for the time being anyway.  

This girl handed me a flier to go to a party tonight for some sorority.  I don't know if I want to go.  Nikole would flip out if she knew I was even thinking about joining a sorority. lol  She's very anti-greek life. It could be fun I guess.  I was talking to the girl for a minute and told her I might come over after work so then we started talking about working and stuff and she looked at me like I was an alien for having a job.  I'm just getting a bad feeling about it.  The more I think about it the more I think I am not going to go.  I don't know.  I'll think about it more.  I have to work til 11 tonight anyway.  Probably not a good idea to show up to a party like that sweaty and reeking of pizza. lol 
But I've hear sorority girls have a lot fun.  ;)"

"event","Ok not really.  It just seems like it.  I am trying to find the perfect outfit for tomorrow because tomorrow I am officially a COLLEGE STUDENT!!!!  I am so excited but so scared at the same time.  I mean I know the campus inside and out now.  I know where each of my classes are and what bus to take and everything but still I am so freaked out.  I'm one of those nerdy people that actually likes school. :)

The thing I am most happy about is that I don't live in the dorms.  Technically freshman are required to live in the dorms but I have an aunt that lives kind of close by so I used her address.  Shhhh!  Don't tell the university!!!  My apartment may not be the greatest but my bedroom is bigger that the dorm rooms and I would have to have a roommate in the same room!  ewww  I am an only child so I am not used to sharing.  haha

Ok back to the clothes thing.  Should I go for sexy or sophisticated?  I'm trying to find a blend of both.  Maybe shorts with sandals and a cute tank top?  Or should I go with the skirt with no panties and sit in the front row and give my teachers a show? lol"

"event","I'm still here.  Alive and kicking.  

Here's the biggest news in my life for now.  I decided to quit my job as a phone sex operator.  I was having so many problems with my company calling me to log in and then when I did I felt like I was getting shorted on calls.  It was fun while it lasted.  I miss it at times but I am working 2 other jobs so I don't have much time.  I am still thinking about starting my own line or quite possibly working with a different company.  I actually tried to get on with a couple of other companies.  This one company sounded great but I found out they don't hire in my state and the other required minimum log in times and I just don't have that much extra time.  Oh well.  

I can't believe I start college in a couple weeks.  This summer has been so much fun.  I have always felt trapped being around my parents but living in my apartment has been amazing!  I'm broke but it is so worth it.  This is the happiest I've been in a long time.

I'm still trying to figure out scheduling with my jobs and my classes.  I was actually offered a third job but I am not going to talk about it much since it is the only place in town that provides this particular service and if you read my previous post about privacy I think it's for the best.  

I'll be taking 15 credits this semester and I bought all of my books already.  I didn't know you could do that but the bookstore has these little tags on the shelf and it tells you what books are required for your classes.  It was over $500!!!  I won't get my loan money until classes start so I paid this out of my pocket.  I'm so poor right now.  It really sucked while I was in the bookstore though.  There were other people in there with their parents buying their books for them.  Why does my dad have to be such a hardass?  I've always had to pay my own bills.  My allowance stopped when I was 12 and started babysitting and I have had to work ever since.  Although my mom did say she was going to come up next weekend and take me clothes shopping.  Yay!  

Ok I'm heading out for the night.  I'll update later with some sexy stories :)"

"event","I was talking to a friend on AOL and gave him my the link to my journal.  He asked me if I was sure I wanted this info public and then said if he was a stalker there was enough info on here that he could track me down if he wanted to.  

I'm freaked out now.  I went through and deleted any entry that had anything to do with my jobs or school or anything personal.  

I'm not going to be writing anything personal from now on.  I guess that's a good thing since now I'll probably write more dirty stories. :)"

I love to just lie back in the tub and relax.  Take my time touching every part of my body.  Then when I actually get to my pussy...well you get the idea.  I'm such a tease huh?  Yeah I know I am a bad girl.  Wanna spank me?  hehe

So I am still siting here trying to write my webpage.  This is hard.  How does one entice someone else to call them over other girls for phone sex?  Ooo ooo I know! I'll just write ""My pussy is wetter than hers so you should call me"".  haha  

But seriously I can't believe what a hard time I am having with this.  Ok time to get back to work."

I'm trying to decide if I want to sign on to the service or not.  It can be fun but I'll probably end up as a shemale or something. Blah.

Actually I think I'll take a bath.  Mmmm that sounds nice.  

A nice long soak in hot sudsy water.  My hands running all over my wet body.  Whew, is it hot in here? hehe

I actually have a vibrator that works under water.  Now If I can only figure a way to sneak it in the bathroom with my roommate noticing. ;)"

Andy, a friend of Nikole's, and I decided to get in a little exercise this afternoon.  I had so much fun but I really suck. lol  

I worked a little on the website.  Resized some photos and such.  I am really having a hard time writing my description.  I was looking through what everyone else has to get ideas and there is so much I just can't say about myself.  

I can't call myself a whore or a cum slut or something.  I don't understand what girl can?  I mean don't get me wrong, on the phone I can get extremely nasty but I just can't write that about myself.  

I'm going to try to leave those out.  I don't want to attract the types of callers that are going to be rude or call me a whore.  So then what do I say?  Nice girl wants to get naughty? Would that work?

I want something sexy and flirtatious not vulgar like ""dirty whore wants you to cream her stink hole"".  Is that really what guys want to read?  I love anal sex and I love loads shot in my ass but I feel weird writing that about myself. 

I at such a loss on what to say."

While lying in bed I got so damn hot.  I was just going to use my fingers for a quick cum but decided to jump on AOL.  I met a great guy in a chat room and after chatting for awhile I decided to call him.  He kept saying all this stuff to me like ""you have such a cute voice you should do this for a living"". LOL  It took all I had to not bust out laughing.  Oh if he only knew.  :)

There is this little kid's voice that says ""challenge everything"".  Well, in my dream he kept whispering to me.  It was the same voice but he was telling me all sorts of scary stuff.  I was so freaked out when I woke up this morning.

But anyway, work went well today. Nikole brought her girlfriend in for lunch.  They are such a cute couple!  I got off at 4:30 and now I'm just surfing the web and being lazy.  I think I might cook something for dinner tonight.  My roommate told me all he ever sees me eat lately are apples with peanut butter. lol

If I get motivated I might get on the phones for a little bit."

Ok well since it is the middle of the night and I can't sleep. I'll talk about a fantasy that I want to try out in the middle of the night.

I was up on campus earlier today walking around and scouting things out. There is this big lawn behind one of the classroom buildings.  At the end there is a little patch of grass surrounded by 2 bushes and a tree.  It's very secluded.  

I am making a promise to myself right now.  By the end of my freshman year I will have gotten lucky in that spot!

I've had sex outdoors before but this patch of grass looks so lush.  I bet it would feel amazing on my skin.  I love rolling around in the grass.  But at night it would be sensual.  The feel of the soft grass on my back. The cool air whisping over my body.  

Screw getting laid I think I am going to go masturbate there!!! *heehee*"

OMG! I left my vibrator laying on the bed!!!

I felt completely humiliated at first but now I feel a little better.  I wonder if he saw it.  Actually I am wondering if he picked it up to look at it.  Maybe even sniffed it a little. Hmmm. I'm bad. hehe

I've only had 3 calls since I logged on.  The service is a little slow tonight.  Although I did have one fantasy about getting in on the the back of a jeep.  That was hot.  But otherwise I am siting here waiting for the phone to ring."

"event","shit.My speakers are broken.I wanted to listen to Regina.""uncle bobby"".I think that is on the other user name on this ol' computer anyway.Back to school has been eventful so far.Today i shopped around for some Halloween costumes at the mall.I'm thinkin' maybe I'll be the ""no rain"" bee girl?Otherwise maybe Mandark or possibly a greek goddess?Maybe not a greek goddess.Although I confess I would probably look like a damn fox in any of those leg ave costumes.Ahh!Ms Allen is just really making me very nervous.It is my belief that she supposing that I'm some artistic treasure(as she knows I've taken a few art classes and is simply misunderstanding time spent for talent)when really I'm the most mediocre nothing.This probably does not sound like quite a big deal to anyone else, but honestly it makes me just feel very self conscious now.THis is only adding to my previous worries regarding my artistic ability.More to mound upon my worries:I've got a project due this Friday that I've yet to begin, and should probably be attempting to not procrastinate with like I've done with every other project every fucking single year before this.I'm beginning to be concerned with what I'm going to do with my life.i love all things art related and would never want to live without that being a giant part of my life.The only difficulty with this is that is I've got absolutely zero talent.although yes that doesn't mean i cant do something in a field related to the arts.and that would be ideal if it weren't for the fact i don't have the grades for any such thing.oh how i would love to do something like art therapy!i could work with kids perhaps, and help them express experiences or emotions they're unable to with words by using some kind of art form.why am i such a defeatist? i could still work hard this year and try my best to accumulate all the knowledge i can regarding artistic techniques.I just need to focus.I'm really wishing i had a little patron saint to sooth my nerves right now.lame indeed.
i just realized as i was rambling that i am a worry warted idiot!i shouldn't be so closed minded!i can always appreciate art and incorporate that love in everyday life without it being apart of my career!this is the first time I've ever even considered that.only because I'm not much interested in anything else.mmh.ok.this will be weird now.I feel strangely elated!nice to end one of these with some positivity for one of the very few times ever!"

iv yet to listen to the new bright eyes album.mixed feelings on whether this decision was decided or not.
the computer may be single most depressing device to ever be devised.it makes me feel more lonely than i think i am in actuality.i suspect this is mostly because they removed daria from you tube due to copy write clauses or what have you."

today a girl in my class told my teacher she was accepted to the college she wanted.
it very suddenly dawned on me that this will not be the case for me.i dont care how much i talk about wanting a higher education.its not happening.my parents arent even saving for dana and i like they did for dan.that is probably the most discouraging thing ive ever heard.
my fallopian tube fucking kills!i can only assume thats what it is.i fucking want to gut my own self.all those wormy organs make me sick.ill take a spoon to em all!

"event","just not very happy.and the smiths arent helping any.

today sitting in the car i began to imagine the inside of my head and just assumed there might be tiny stringy peices holding your squishy brain to your thick granet skull.i dont know why i visualized it.but it came to me so clearly like i had studied it in a diagram in some nameless texbook at one point.it didnt make me squirmish or uneasy.it hurt.picturing this was physicaly painful.it caused me to shuddered and shut my eyes tight.

in other news im starting to think i seriously over react.im constantly thinking the when people talk to me and harmless dialog we share is really an attack on me.i listen keenly ofr any change in tone,sarcasum or malice.i dont know why i feel like everyones out to get me.maybe this paranoia comes from the fact that im extremely two faced.just becuase im a lying bitch doesnt mean everyone else is.going hand in hand with this,people's oppinions of me are really starting to wear me down.most of these ""opinions"" are what i simply assume most poeple think of me.again.why do i just accept and even create the idea of people dispising me?



i feel the way i felt about my lungs about my brain now.the residue i imagine is stuck in cranies,in pores and i feel disgusting.i feel revolting.its like dirt under your fingernails.but inside of you.you cant imagine how sick i am with myself.and now theres no way of undoing these things.and i even have thoughts of revisiting.like my brains actually begging for more filth untill every nook is filled,no longer pink and happy but blackened and used up."

you'd sceeve my drinking out of the carton/gallon/bottle(it just tastes better)
you'd be fatter than you could ever imagine!(not that im a good cook,just a pushy one)
we'd most likely have a bad track record with pets(anything put into my care dies,and i cant promise this wont apply for you too)
i'd never leave your side(mostly because im a scaredy cat who needs a protector)
we'd listen to allot of bad music and probably watch allot of bad movies(avril and teen 90s flicks)
we'd sleep outside allot,maybe even have a futon on the porch(though ill probably have a bad dream followed by a freak out in the middle of the night and leave you alone.sorry)
we'd have to live within short distance of a lake/beach/reservoir(muck up the drinking water,not that wed care wed only drink bottled)
we'd hike,and kayak,and white water raft(only well really just rock the raft and make it splashy out on the still reservoir
we'd take summer trips to iceland and new zealand and love in the terrain and learn to surf!(or drown trying!)
we would drive to petting zoos and mini golfs(except fucking golf quest)and throw parties and buy supplies at target
there'd be concerts to see and parks to invade and lots of grass to lay in oh!and trees to climb!"

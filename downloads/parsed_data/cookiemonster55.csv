"event","Today was GAY!! okay....I had lost My Uconn Jackett 4 like 2 weeks now or something like that...and today while @ breakfast(kind of lol Karley) I see someone WEARING my jackett!! I was like...flipping out!! (for anyone who dont know Uconn is university of connecticut,My favorite team!!) so Me and Karley go up to her and are like hey, where'd ya get that Jacket? And this retard goes..Uhm...My sister got it for me from spencers or somewhare! (HELLO spencers dont sell clothing...and IF they did It WOULDNT be sports and collage stuff!) So I say..Are you shure? And shes like Uhm i dont know My sister got it from a store! by the way she is a really bad lier!So WE talked 2 officer Morhan about it because You cant git Uconn stuff in any stores down here because its a Northern state and everything. He talked 2 her and she gave him a completly diffrent story. I think this girl needs 2 get a life!! Anyway officer said they were gonna call her parents and make her give it back to me...but not today says officer morhan because He said Its too cold outside...really it wasnt!!...That was earlie in the morning. I was late 4 Class and then Mrs.Pottter wouldnt let me go 2 my locker because shes a meanie poo head! I went durring second hour. Then everyone had 2 get their back checked 4 scoliosis...(or something like that) And Vision & Hearing! Whell I have 20-20 vision and perfect hearing...turns out I DONT have scoloisis. LUNCH TIME!!! YAY!! So i get to lunch and of cource I was my usual crayzee self and only to increase the chances of Passing out from high blood presure Veronica brought like...2 or 3 bags of candy!! we had Starbursts, Pixie sticks, Gummie Worms and other Yumo stuff! lol I was SOOOO hyper! (and people think Im am usually...u should see me when I eat food!!)OKAY~~>
GYM! 
I get to Gym and there she is again! That freak wearing my Jacket! okay I dont know about everyone else but I think its really low of someone to steel #1 And then Lie about it, and tell like 3 or 4 diffrent lies to people!...This girl needs help!!
Okay so Jordan and Ver and Maggie go up to her and ask her where she got her Jackett...and NOW she says she got it in the mall at North Port...im sorry but I dont particulary remember the mall in North Port. I am PRETTY shure that theres one in Port Charlotte but Not one in North Port.....SO they ask her if she knows what it means(Uconn) And she answered..It means uhh...like University of Kentucky or something like...University of connecticut! I was SOOOOOO mad!! 
So then shes like I have other Uconn stuff at home and I'd be proud to give her some! Whell If she has other stuff at home why did she need 2 steel my Jacket, And WHY didnt she know whta it ment, And Why dosnt she ever whare it? This girl needs serious help! OKAY so Thats purty much how my day went! Oh yah And...I forgot what I was gonna say so.....Bye--Lacey--


Heres a Little tip 4 everyone...DONT STEEL oh and have a nice day :)"

I had some Instring convorsations with Veronica today, we talked about bums on rails, Green jello in my pants, And lawn nomes! It was...Invigorating! We are becoming a part of the book club(how geekee is that!?!?) We have come up to about 100.00$ each In books that see that look Fun..to look at...not read! 
They might be inviting me in thir band...(her and Krys) But only if their manager (the lawn knowm named sleepy) Lets me in! I think it would be fun but one problem..none of us can play! Wow our band is gonna be awesome!!  At lunch I discovered Shot Glasses out of the little ketchup holders and as soon as i knew it everyone at my table was taking shots of water!! Fun times!! I think tommorow, If we go slowly, we can handle fruit prunch! But I dunno it seems like a big risk to me!!
In Science i just had  MERRY time...espicially since I got to be with MY FAVORITE TEACHER EVER (not really...Scarcasam people!..I hate her) WE didnt even eat Ice cream! Frikkin lozer!

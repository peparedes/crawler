"event","...Experience is an amazing, wicked, thing.  I've gained it by the bucketful by every little thing that I see or that happens near me or to me, and I move with it.  I have a bad habit of leaning into the touch of things I KNOW will hurt me just because I know it will bring knowledge and greater understanding with it.  Amazingly, it's never gotten me into trouble I couldn't ultimately handle, though I imagine a good part of that is only because of what the experiences taught me even as they crushed.  

   I've never expected other people to do the same.  I've been told I have some frightening and likely damaging coping mechanisms, which would include that leaning into what I know will hurt me because I believe it will ultimately be worth it.  I usually get roped into the idea of doing it for someone else somehow, being some help...  I just get more benefits than everyone else thinks, in my mind.  Just because I'm eager for life lessons doesn't mean I would suggest my methods...  they're mine, and I understand that.  

   So many people think I'll be callous towards their pain from something because I have so much history and day to day experience with it.  I've held people who are crying and trying to APOLOGIZE to me for not holding out, saying how I must think them such babies.  It makes me damn sad that they rarely ever seem to believe me when I tell them that pain is relative, perception, and they're in hell right now, I do understand.  My problems are not theirs, and... well, pain IS entirely relative.  I've often found myself glad that I endured what I did in high school just because it made me capable of handling what became of me once I started off to college, as it multiplied by rabbits.  

   I had shingles this past month and I'm only just finishing the last vestiges of it, and it's something I would never wish on my worst enemies...  I handled it horribly, experience or no.  It's strip-mined the resources I worked so hard to build up after being diagnosed and the fibromyalgia's back in all its glory with a few twists...  And I just broke down when I realized what I was in for, sobbing on the stairs.  I handled putting the damn thing into regression before without meds for it, pure determination and will, drive, a refusal to be beaten down...  But I've been so battered in the past few years by my own damn body's ails that...  It's just too daunting.  I don't want to spend another six months minimum making sure my meals are good and square and frequent in order to push that beast away again.  Not since my diet's been so changed that it's damn hard to get said good down period, let alone being sure of nutritious value.  It might work if I can get the nausea under a better handle because damn to I love to cook from scratch... the kitchen heat just got to be unbearable when the nausea got into full swing, when I was eighteen.  That would be lovely, really...

   I got into the mood to write this though, because I relived an experience after the subject was brought up chatting with a friend... and the details wouldn't leave me.  

   I love people, with all their dreams and loves and faults.  An old friend used to always scorn me in utter confusion because he believed the world was a terrible place and needed to be fixed, and I always returned that I thought it was perfect as was...  Sometimes I have a hard time telling the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" things that happen to people; in my mind, there's no such thing.  An event has an ill or adverse effect on a person entirely based on how they perceive it...  just like how I perceive many of the bad things that happened to me as having been good, and my ""leaning into danger"" has always been a worthy adventure or endeavor for me, even while I've made my friends shriek warnings before they tried to figure out why I wasn't getting burned.  

   I'm very familiar with seizures, though I use the term loosely.  I refer to my own disorder as ""the Twitch"" and it's not technically a neurological disorder we think, the more we go along, but a muscle disorder.  Unlike the classic case of seizures you see (grand mal) I do not lose awareness, and so far as we've been able to tell, nothing is firing oddly in my brain when it happens, as with epileptics.  On the other end of the spectrum, my ""fits"" are significantly more ""violent"" than most people with honest seizures; I've thrown myself close to two yards on occasion, slam my elbows into my thighs, give myself mass cases of whiplash, and that's when I'm being held on a king-size bed, without anything to hurt myself with.  I've almost flipped desks, been trapped under desks, slammed any part of my body as hard as my strength allows into the furniture and floor.  If there's a way to hurt myself during my fits, I've long found all the methods, though I've been careful to avoid some.  After a while you get enough ""experience"" as it were to predict and try to counteract the things that will end badly, like getting the hell out of a bathroom if you're lucky enough to feel it coming, shoving the things in your hands or lap to someone else so you make less mess, purposefully trapping your hands in blankets so the movement is slowed and you're less likely to smack someone.  

   I know myself, and I understand what I learn.  It took me years to really understand how horrifying it was to see that same sure knowledge in someone other than myself.  No wonder people crowded and worried, for all that it was my normal, I suppose.  

   I worked at this house that was sort of a step between for delinquent girls between house arrest and jailtime, with a lot of behavior modification program stuff instilled, pretty controlled environment.  Thankfully I was just graveyard staff, but we came on at 10pm and stayed until 8am, and we woke the girls at 6am, so there was some interaction.  

   We'd had one of the girls on watch for a while, she was apparently having seizures increasingly often, as of yet undiagnosed but they were working on it.  I'd seen some of the other girls getting under her shoulders and helping her walk when she looked dead tired, and how she was allowed on the couch hat normally they were restricted fro and let to sleep which was another rule...  And I remembered seeing some of the other staff look irritated, like they knew they were being scammed but had to tolerate it, and some of the girls with bits of jealousy and malice, even as so many girls were dead concerned.  I wasn't sure how much was genuine and how much put on because I was used to the manipulation games the girls thought they were subtle with by then...  

   I knew that weary bite of waiting to be told to stop misbehaving when I curiously asked her how long they lasted, how often they happened, because the staff seemed to be torn on what to believe, and I believe that every angle is worthwhile.  It's why I love people so much... it's all perception games and the truth has so many facets it'll keep me playing with it like a puzzle game for hours if not weeks.  I stayed neutral and empathetic, and made sure she understood hat I wasn't looking for more than an answer, and she explained what she had been told of when and how long because she wasn't conscious for it... that she only felt the pain and exhaustion afterwards.  

   I never lose awareness during mine, not unless I manage to fall asleep truly (which takes some real damn exhaustion, let me say), but I knew exactly what she meant by the exhaustion.  I had never had someone try to practically carry me the way her friends were catering to her, largely because it would have made me feel worthless, with my personality, but I could SEE that exhaustion and how she was trying to cope by doing her best not to care that some people thought she was making it out to be more than it was...  Hell, the poor girl didn't even know when it was happening, she just got the backlash, the bruises and the muscle pain and that deep, deep bone-weary exhaustion.  Your muscles were never meant to move that way, not regularly, not more than a handful of times a month and rarely together; we're not built for that abuse, so it hurts and it tires more than one would think given the amount of motion actually involved, especially with the normal types, not me.  If someone sees me in a fit they KNOW how much it costs, the motions are so exaggerated with mine and you can just see the power it takes to do them, but the ones so many can perceive as a kind of shakes?  It can be hard for people to get their heads around.  

   Unless you've experienced or tried to hold someone, or you've seen similar enough, or understand anatomy enough to see how purely unnatural the motion is, it can be very hard to comprehend the work involved.  The motions are normally so small because the muscle is already wound and constrained so tightly that they're not capable of moving more than that, even though they're doing their damndest.  As best as i can figure, mine are such big motions because mine isn't an electrical impulse gone wrong, it's that something has been slowly building tension in my muscles and they finally reached breaking point, where they could either seize to release tension or cramp, twist, and lock down on themselves.  My ""seizing"" is a reaction, a good, helpful one even, not the problem itself, and so in doing it, my muscles regain some of their power and... yeah, more power to fight back what's hurting them, with me in the middle.  

   I don't even remember her name...  I can think of five names, one of which I know was hers, but I've forgotten it now, for all that I'll never forget her face, how she looked and how I tried to ease her pain as much as I could that morning.  I wonder if she remembers my name...  I never actually filed the report I was supposed to on the incident, I figured there were so many witnesses that I didn't want to relive it, especially after they TAPED part of it...  I wonder if she even knows it was me who took care of her those two hours, refusing to leave her side, when the poor thing had only had a fit for up to iftten minutes before, if memory serves, even if they'd been somewhat frequent.  I was the only staff with a fucking clue of how to treat her properly, I swear to God...  

   The girls had a max amount of time for their showers and chores in the morning, the ones that shower in the morning instead of at night.  The girl with the seizures, we suddenly realized one morning, was behind, no one had been in that bathroom for a while, cleaning they did every morning behind schedule.  One of the sweeter girl came for us when she couldn't get the door open, and the other girl wasn't responding.  We did a search; she wasn't anywhere else in the house.  

   She was trapped in that tiny closet of a tub and toilet.  

   It took some maneuvering for me to get in, since I was the smallest and most flexible of the people working that morning, and I managed to mover her enough that we could get the door open.  She'd had aura's of some sort because she'd obviously prepared in whatever little time she'd had.  Her head was on a towel on the ground near the tub but not too close, and her legs half wrapped around one side of the toilet in enough of a way that she kept them trapped there ever as the rest of her shook and writhed; it had been her knees holding the door in place.  Before the toilet was put in, there was maybe 4x4 square feet of space on the floor, s like I said, tiny closet of a space.  

   Possibly the worst place to have a fit that I have ever seen, even more than being trapped on a tile floor against a wall under a metal and glass desk.  At least I was aware during mine and had some means of protecting my head, even if it was just cradling it with both my arms and sobbing because that made the whiplash harsher.  She was fully dressed, and I had to wonder why she hadn't bolted from the bathroom as soon as she felt it, or had she wasted her time dressing instead?  Or had she already been dressed and didn't want to face the humiliation, and instead risked her skull against the porcelain in a fit of pride?  

   Hell, I'd done stupid shit for my pride before, though my self-preservation usually kicked in before I could get too deep, and my pride is a pretty malleable creature, more than most people's, at least.  or had it been that with the auras coming on, she simply hadn't thought of it and went with the only immediate thought that came to mind: ""I need to protect my head from this tub, and I've got a towel.""

   A lot of things bothered me at the time; I was doing my damndest to both protect her form hurting herself with all the hard surfaces around and untwist her from the appliances enough to get her somewhere safer.  t first I didn't even bother with that, didn't bother with getting the door more open to let in Vicky to help me, assuming that this might be short-lived, maybe even on the tale end of a fit considering how long she'd been unaccounted for.  Trying to twist her out from her surroundings was like to hurt her and it WOULD take her a lot closer from the tub and wall she'd managed to keep as much distance from as she could somehow, and I hoped at first that I wouldn't have to risk it.  

   Looking back, through my ""danger mode"" thought frame, the thing that twists me deep inside that I mostly took as a good sign then is what got me on this tirade.  She understood what was happening to TRAP her legs, like I will mine, she understood that her safety alone rested not most in the towel for padding but in keeping her body from being CAPABLE of flinging her too hard into hard things.  

   Experience teaches...  I ought to know.  As I said, while I never considered too deeply what others honestly thought after knowing I'd been outcast and would be stared at whenever I twitched, it was something else entirely to see someone else go through the same thing, with that same tried and true teacher that liked to make or break you.  However much I like my method of learning some days, I would never wish to inflict on anyone what they don't want.  I am grateful for the lessons my twitch brought me in the long run, but I never wanted it; it was simply my lot in life.  

   I wanted to protect her more than anything, no matter what I had to do.  

   This wasn't exactly a new emotion for me... it's what I've always done, even as a small child.  I am also very clinical in my frame of mind when I see danger lurking, very analytical and cool, but I just UNDERSTOOD to such a degree...  and I wanted to keep her from hurting anymore than she already would from the motions themselves when she came back to herself.  I've always had that kind of heart, but it...  

   What really made it so poignant, in part, was when I finally let Vicky in to help, when I realized that this wasn't going to pass quickly enough for the bathroom's risks to be less than rising injury untangling her in such a small space was Vicky.  I was afraid she would get more power if she had her legs and I wasn't disappointed; most of my powerful ones come from when it comes through my lower back and hips, the lower body is just so much stronger.  I used body body as a constant cushion, barrier, and brace to keep her movement minimal until we got her straight enough that we could get her carried out, and that took a while...  I definitely got my share of bruises, and my arthritis was SCREAMING, but I hardly cared.  The position we ended up in for a while, because once we got her legs free they curled and it was almost impossible to get the door open again, was with my right knee boring down on her shoulder next to her neck to keep her from getting closer to the tub, right hand loosely over the top of her crown and behind her head, to take in the shock when she went up and to prove another barrier if she turned out more lie me than I though and surprised me with something stronger than usual and went into the tub anyway; she DID surprise me a few more times, more power than I thought she had in her by then.  My lower left leg was snugged against her ribs to keep her from moving too much my way, tightly held with enough cush from my calf that it shouldn't hurt her, and I was trying to direct Vicky on how to hold her other side, as her side and arm and hips were still thrashing rather well and while I was trying to hold that too, I've only got so much body to work with and restrain a young teenager without the restraint hurting her in the end.  

  I don't really blame Vicky, and I didn't then, for all that I was frustrated beyond all means with her.  She was in a brand new situation, I could tell she was nervous, and it was like she couldn't understand what I was trying to tell and show her what to do.  She made more general grab and hold attempts that won't work half as well and were more likely to hurt them both if the girl moved hard and unexpectedly.  She didn't understand how close she needed to be, to make her body into a buffer and that if she did it correctly, working as that buffer would not, COULD NOT hurt her because the idea was to also take away the girl's leverage.  Maybe she was more affected than I realized, looking back... maybe I was rambling and expecting her to understand a train of logic that is mostly just native to me; I've been known for that one extensively my whole life, it's always been what, along with my good grades and happy nature, eventually ended up with me labeled as the harmless, brainy eccentric.  

   In any case, her lack of understanding drove the stake of how important this was to me deeper, drove it into me how much I understood because of what I had been through where maybe others just couldn't follow sometimes...  Made me realize that however much I love to dive into the unknown, I was damn glad that others rarely followed me, that they DID dismiss me as the eccentric and left me to my devices.  I understood this girl's pain more than she would ever really know, wanted to protect and care for her all I could even though she was little more than a stranger, and it quickly became evident that I was the only one who had a clue as to HOW to protect her.  I shifted so that I kept my right knee to her shoulder but instead sat on my butt against her left side and spread my left leg over her body to snug my foot against her right side, pinned her arm against her chest with my left hand and used the girl as my base of balance, exerted more strength to keep her still without enough to hurt her, and told Vicky to just focus on getting the door open again.  My arthritis in my hips and knees absolutely hated me, especially with the extra strength I had to use, but as before, I didn't really care much; it wasn't relevant.  

   Once we got her out into the room outside, a bedroom, I had everyone fetch pillows to work as I had been just using me and kept watch over her, though most of the fight had gone out of her already, few powerful moves left.  At the same time, she didn't stop for... for hours, it seemed like, and I know it was in reality at leas ninety minutes, but maybe over two hours; I can't remember anymore.  For the most part I just sat on the floor by her, talking incase she could hear me, carding my fingers through her hair for until after nine-thirty...  I refused to leave until it had mostly passed, and no one argued with me on it.  Then it was home to sleep for the day and be ready to come back to work at night, and for the most part nothing was ever said about it again.  

   I just...  I noted a part of this story to a friend earlier and the emotions hit again like a freight train, refusing to let me loose until I had relived it all again, almost making me cry.  She was helpless, and I could do so little, yet it was so much more than everyone else, apparently.  I never would have thought that someone else might not have been able to do it, even though I've had so many people try to help me in my fits and it's only recently that I've found any method tolerable.  I always assumed I couldn't be helped other than maybe getting me somewhere where there were less surroundings to hurt myself with.  I assumed I was always alone, and it was frightening, but... it was what it was, I thought.  I didn't want anyone to even try helping me because it never actually helped, and then they would either get annoyed or feel terrible for having tried and not done anything worthwhile.

   ...Mari was the first one to change that.  He decided to try to comfort me anyways, even when I warned him not to be hopeful and... even just having a reassuring touch on my back that did nothing for the twitching itself was an amazing comfort.  It didn't technically help, but to not be ALONE...  I suppose that was so much of what sparked my NEED to help that girl as much as I possibly could, what made it mean so much to me when I now I was merely a passing face and I'm fairly sure she remembers nothing from what was likely the worst fit she has still ever experienced.  

   I wish she remembers, to maybe soothe that loneliness, but at the same time, it's alright if she doesn't.  It's never been a particular dream of mine to be some remembered hero...  It's a nice thought, and I don't mind when it does happen, but I don't go out of my way to help however I can for the sake of being recognized or something.  I just...  I think I would feel hollow inside, if I hadn't, you know?  I HAVE to try to help whoever I can... why else would I be here, wish a will and a want and the ability to, if this isn't what I was meant for?  It's what feeds my soul sometimes, I swear, whether it's by holding that girl when she had no defenses or covering for a friend when they could use help with an errand, to maybe saving someone in an ambulance to writing my stories and giving out entertainment that so many, myself included, seek out as an escape and relief from life.  

   All that is experience too...  Maybe I balance out what I'm told are stupid decisions with my moments of pure joy and contentment, the same way my pain comes in highs and lows, with little middle ground.  Hell if I know, but I'm more or less satisfied with life, so I'm not sure what's so unhealthy about my habits."

"event","Well, the good news is that it hasn't happened in a little over three years, and is infrequent.  The bad news, however, is that I just had on HELL of a twitch fit... the sobbing helplessly kind, though as least I was on my bed and not trapped in a desk or something (that had to be one of the WORST ones to have ever happened, mostly because I was terrified that a violent enough movement would knock me senseless).  My room is nice and relatively soundproof, which I normally appreciate for reasons I won't list, but I couldn't get my body under enough control to get out of the gate and screens blocking the bedroom from my office area without probably really hurting myself, and my phone was on my desk.  

In retrospect, I should have just screamed bloody murder instead of slowly giving into the sobs that Ammi eventually heard.  It would have gotten the attention I needed a lot faster. 

So Ammi eventually heard me and came to investigate and I imagine I was quite a site, thrashing and sobbing as I was (the fact that I was only wearing a completely open bathrobe and some blankets didn't help either, probably), and did an immediate ""Oh shit!"" and went running for Mari.  Mari's very practiced at helping me though fits... And some to think of it, I'm prety sure Ammi's never been around when I fit bad enough to sob.  I think I've only done that twice, and she wasn't there for them.  

The scary part was that I already had three soma (damn good muscle relaxers) in my bloodstream and it was STILL that bad. I shudder to think what it might have been without...  Probably a repeat of the worst time ever, in California, when I woke up my parents down the hall sobbing (Mari's narcoleptic and had had a damn long day and had already held me though a fit, I don't blame him for not waking from the cries even if he was next to me).  I black out a few times, for a couple seconds here and there in that one, and it was bead enough painwise that it's acquired that very surreal quality...  I mostly remember my Munna holding me and just moving THOUGH the twitching with me, so I could use her as a backbone instead of my own, and apparently Mari did the same for some of it, and seeing my father standing in the doorway with a look of horror and utter helplessness on his face...  Before that, he's only seen normal running day twitches, that were sometimes in fast succession, but never one of my true ""fits.""  Sunk the point home, but it figures that the only one he ever saw was the worse I've ever experienced.  

Like I said though, I WAS already on three soma and had had a hot bath and later a hot shower to try to calm the muscles before it happened, and it wasn't that bad, though it's pretty high on the scale to make me sob.  Though, technically, I haven't had regular fits in years, so part of the difficulty was likely that my body is no longer conditioned to handle it.  When I was, say, 15/16, i would have multiple fits through the day and twitch otherwise a fair bit in between, probably amounting up to several hundred a day...  But since I learned to avoid that around turning 17, and I'm now nearing 21, my body just can't take abuse in that fashion anymore.  I feel like a novice, or a pussy, for all that I KNOW it's a good thing that I don't have that conditioning now.  I'm far healthier for the lack of constant involuntary muscle movement, and I'm very thankful for it.  

I really should just scream as loud as I can next time so I get help, though.  Damn pride, or fear of scaring the shit out of someone, or something.  I promised Mari I would, next time.  

So Mari came up and helped hold me so I wouldn't hurt myself so bad...  Still did a bit, mostly on HIM, but he's currently being a man and claiming no pain for the elbow to the ribcage.  In the process of it all, we actually learned a lot about what could and couldn't be predicted about my movements (I can feel the tension building before the more violent ones) and how he could best help me without hurting either of us...  It's not the same as holding down someone in a true seizure.  Their motions are usually small, almost as though they're vibrating, limbs and such moving two inches max (though I've held someone through a seizure where her motions could go up to 4-6 inches, but those were the rare ones among the many smaller).  I, meanwhile, can fling myself across the king size bed with my bigger ones, on the other hand, and otherwise the full length of my arms, head, torso, or legs can and often WILL extend as far as they can go at high speed.  In a switch centering lower in my torso, my hips as a norm do that same fast movement up to two feet forward or bad, and sometimes a good foot to the side in the process, or as a separate movement; my back is the same, and when those happen the rest of my body is jerked along sometimes in completely unpredictable motions.  The bigger ones...  I've done the whole toes on the ground, crown of the head on the ground, with your body a perfect arch in between.  The doing isn't so bad, honestly, but the landing HURTS and knocks all your breath out of you as though you'd been punched in the gut.  It was a running joke in high school that I could hit someone and totally get away with it, though I never did...  Though I did have a tendency to accidentally fling shit around (like pizza across the table at Ammi when I was holding a slice and twitched).  

It felt like 20 minutes, which is thankful for me... it was actually more like three hours, come to find out.  For a few minutes near then end I though I was going into lockdown (Which is an utterly horrific, terrifying experience I never EVER want to experience again; once was more than enough to sufficiently cow me into avoiding it at all costs.  You see, the twitching isn't a problem, it's actually my body's solution to tightening muscles in my back, so that when I lose the strength to twitch, those muscles instead begin to tghten more, crap, twist on themselves, lock down, and then move on to neighboring muscles in the rest of your body.  All your muscles LOCED into a fetal position is painful as hell because it's far higher tension than causes the twitching in the first place, and trying to move anyway makes it scream more... as you slightly find yourself curling back into the fetal anyhow.  As I said, once was more than enough, if I see the start signs and I do whatever necessary to run like a screaming child.).  Anyhow, I was on FIVE soma at that point (Mari medicated me to try stopping it early on, and I've have done it once it started but the soma was by my phone, same problem) and there's far too many cases of people overdosing from taking six to consider it.  Granted, they took it in much faster succession and probably had a lower tolerance, but the last thing we needed to top the night off was overdose.  We also considered my painkillers to knock me out faster if I started lockdown, but while at lower doses the interaction between soma and opiates is negligible, at a high dose of the relaxer, it might be risky.  

So Mari babysat me in the bath instead.  It sounds funny to say, and I think I'd have been fine, but you NEVER let someone with that many drugs in their system, especially MUSCLE RELAXERS, in a body of water unsupervised.  I pointed out that I know warning signs enough to know to at least get out of the tub fast and stay on the floor if I had to, but he had a point about the dissociative qualities of soma and the chance that I might not notice if it were happening until too late.  

Mari messaged Kye while she was still on what was happening so I hadn't just completely disappeared, and I'll talk to her tomorrow, but I wish that I could have told Ammi when I got better (lockdown signs were the last of it fading out before the soma finished integrating into my bloodstream); she was already asleep.  Not that I blame her, it was three in the morning by then.  

I think this was a mass buildup of stress and stuff... the last two weeks have been a mild throwback to high school for intensity, and I was worried about it, but now that the body got it OUT through such a fit it's likely to calm so long as I relax more, and my emotional state has calmed dramatically in the last two days, as has the schoolwork load (last week had 4 midterms).  

So... yeah.  I think it should be okay, though I probably really nee to talk to my rheumy and possibly that neuro she wanted to refer me to when I told her this was getting worse on Friday... Was that Really only yesterday?  Hell, I hate to be a bother to her, but this probably fills in to the list of things I should call and discuss with her about because it DOES relate to my health, and she probably WILL send out that referral, and... Well, so long as it's not my old neuro (and it's not because he was pediatric) then it should be okay.  I still want to work out a records transfer, though, but hey, that means talking to his office, not his staff...  Did I mention my old neuro and I were never on vaguely good terms?  Something about me repeatedly more or less telling him to go fuck himself...  Him telling me I can't do things because they're impossible while I'm sitting there not doing them...  him making me more or less comatose for a few weeks, then sleepwalking every other time I was forced back onto his meds...  That or puking my guts out in the middle of class...  We REALLY didn't get along, though parting ways with him the last time was fuckin' hilarious because he seemed like he was on the verge of tears to see someone else had helped me solve the problem pretty completely (Munna's theory was that he wanted to do a paper on me), and he had some sentimental 'future' thing running, though my Da and I both agreed walking out that it felt as though we'd just gotten fired or something.  Good riddance, man...

*sighs* Anyhow, bedtime...  And in the unlikely circumstance that it happens again I'm going to scream, no matter that I sound like a dieing seagull.  Mari's other suggestion was to fling something on the floor hard because his hangout area is directly under the bedroom, but the only thing close enough on hand was Ammi's kitten, and not only would he have not made enough noise but... well, yeah, just not.  That one's against my morals (for all that flinging cats across the house in open spaces isn't) even if Ammi wouldn't kill me for scaring the shit out of her cat.  And if I'd had my cat, he'd have made more noise anyhow...  Still not conducive to thought processing, however amusing it still leaves me with the 'not working' factor... And screaming would be more effective anyhow, I prance about the room like a moron running story ideas through my sull anyhow and sometimes trip or make things fall (I  actually sprained my ankle bad enough to need crutches for a few days doing this) so a loud *bump* might be dismissed anyhow.  

Can You tell I'm exhausted?  Your muscles aren't meant to move that way ever, let alone for hours on end, and it hurts to do, and I'm stoned on soma too, which usually makes me act like mostly insanely tipsy happy drunks to start with.

...Right, I'm sleeping."

"event","The question, I suppose, is 'Will writing this out help?' 

I've been told it's supposed to be relaxing, or something... and I suppose that when I find myself in a tight spot, now and then I do come here, and now and then it, in turn, helps a little.  

A great uncle of mine is dying; I've known this for weeks now, but while we've met, I barely know the man, and can only grieve inasmuch as I would for a stranger, and grieve for the signs I see in my parents.  I am familiar with that sort of thing... after all, who isn't?  We have all known of someone or other who died but we didn't know well, and most of us have at some point seen how badly a death can affect a person they know and love.  

My grandfather had been dying for a few years now...  We realized yesterday that 'might not make it through next winter' was really 'He's suffocating from the inside out, come say goodbye and don't bring the six-year-old, she should never remember him this way'.  I'm half trying to stand firm for my mother's sake as this finally hits home, because I've always been the one to hold her as she screams and sobs because someone has died, be they family member or when she watched the towers fall.  She needs something to keep her grounded, and while my father understands this, he tends to be at a loss for how; understanding other people is only something he came on fairly late in life.  So I'm going back and forth between holding firm because my coping mechanism in large part is to simply make sure everything will still be okay once the storm finishes rocking the boat, and simply bursting into tears because oh God, I knew he was fading but now he really is going to be forever gone.  

I found out late last night, and it was both logical, because I knew it would happen eventually, but surreal, because it wouldn't hit home.  Today it was the same until I had to explain to a teacher who knows my father that we were having a mild family emergency, to see if he declines faster I can jump ship and take my midterm later so i can see him one last time... and again I find myself crying, just as I did in said teacher's office this morning.  I felt like a real ass for that, I hadn't meant to cry... though I should have realized I was going to, forcing the idea closer to reality when I knew it hadn't really hit yet.  

I was melancholy after that but it stayed vague until I realized I ought to tell Ammi and Micky, especially if I wanted to see if Micky wouldn't mind hanging out with me at mom's when she wasn't going to be at our house already, since she hates her roommate and so I wouldn't be alone in trying to take care of Jenai while mom's away, until Stephen and I can come up if it really is true that he's going now.  

There's a sliver of a chance he might recover again, but his lung capacity is so damn low that it's asking for a miracle.

Ammi saw it, and I didn't lie that I wasn't good, but wasn't feeling up to talking yet before she came over to try to drag me somewhere more private to talk, because she worries about me when I forget I'm supposed to worry.  It wasn't a secret or anything so I just gathered up my guts to say 'Maynard's dying' before taking my hand back; if I'd let her try to calm me down out of sight right then I'd have gotten deeper in it instead.  The tears snapped out a bit but not as bad that time.  Her face hardened and she asked for what plan we were going with, and offered how it sounded bad but that death was a part of life, but, 'though I know you know that, hell, you're going into medicine' and I agreed.  I've known that for a long time now, and I've known he was dying for the past few years... that doesn't make it stop hurting.  

Mari, Micky and her baby, and I went over to my folks earlier; Munna asked for me to come to dinner and bring whoever, so we could solidify the last few details of what I needed to do while she was away and I think so she could see some friendly faces.  I'd seen her just last Saturday, but...  God, I didn't realize someone could gray like that.  She was perfectly blonde on Saturday, but there's suddenly so much silver in her hair, up on top almost like it was just the sun that did it...  I worry what this is doing to her, and I can't even imagine the wreck I would be if Da died.  I love my grandpa Maynard, but we were never amazingly close... he was just my grandpa, if that makes any sense.  

We have a cat, Tabitha, that's the same age as me, roughly, meaning she's somewhere close to 21, like I will be at the end of the month.  We've thought that cat was dying on us on and off again for years now... for longer than we've known the emphysema was going to kill Maynard, but she kept surprising us, making complete turnaround comebacks.  Ammi likes to call her 'the vampire witch cat' and she and Mari have running jokes about how she's actually a zombie or vampire, living off stolen bits of the creatures around her or something.  She's always been very focused on getting attention, very talkative when trying to get it, and very talkative when being paid any attention, leaning into any touch in typical exaggerated cat fashion.  

Tonight she appeared silently and crawled into Mari's lap before curling up, completely silent, to stay unmoving for the rest of the night, not even protesting when I picked her up and moved her to my lap instead.  It's beyond strange behavior for her, not even reacting to being pet and adored.  She feels lighter than the little chihuahua my folks got Jen for Christmas, and I know that puppy is only a pound or so...  She's all loose skin and bones that feel like they might snap if I move her too fast... I could get four fingers up to my palm under her collar without pulling it tight, it hung so loose on her.  

I'm pretty sure Maynard is going to outlive the cat now, even if he only makes it until Tuesday.  And just sitting there on the couch, holding this ancient, fragile creature I remember finding behind the couch when I was three years old and being delighted, feeling her bones jut against my hands as I try to comfort her and she doesn't respond like she always has, I remember how frail Maynard was when I was saw him, or great grandpa Thatcher a few months before he died, skin drawn tight against a skeleton frame...  I wanted to burst out crying again but didn't because I wouldn't know if I was grieving my grandfather or the cat I've lived with for almost as long as I can remember, and that felt so wrong.  I love my grandfather far more than I could a cat, but she was what suddenly made it so real... to realize that he was just as weak, barely able to get the breath to speak a few words, as the strangely silent calico I felt was about to breathe her last there in my arms.

I'm crying again...  My eyes still hurt from the tattoo and crying makes them ache and burn, but that's well enough...  I'm not sure this helped at all, but maybe my eyes will rest until morning when I end up telling my Rheumy what's going on when she inevitably asks.

Heh, hey... at least the arthritis is doing better than it has in a while.  I always give Chris bad news, it seems, but she seemed so relieved the last few times, that we'd finally worked out how to end the constant pain...  Heh, wholly different kind of pain, the sort she doesn't have to worry about, this time.  If it has to be bad news, at least it's a different variant.

...Or something, anyway."

"event","...How good of a coping mechanism IS staring at the fire in dismay because it doesn't hurt anymore?  I was muttering about the same thing last post, but I'm starting to realize that that is what forms up the core of my personality.  How odd is the logic behind the idea that pain and being burned by other people is a given, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with diving in headfirst knowing this?  

...Exactly when did the fire cease to burn anymore?  I remember when it broke me down every other day to see something that wasn't right and good... and it's not that I don't care now, because I still do whatever I can to help, just... Well, like I said, the pain became a given.  It's all old hat, it's nothing I won't survive.  I'd like to avoid it if all that ought to be done can still be accomplished while doing so, but if not... it's no big deal.  I never expected anything in return from them, so it's not as if I'm let down if it all goes to hell.  

Why is it so shocking when someone is genuinely pleasant in return?  I used to expect it, or at least expect to not be noticed.  When someone I took a liking to seeks me out on their own... is it supposed to be amazing, and light up my whole world?  I mean, I'm not unhappy without that gift... it's beyond nice when I get it, but I do well enough with Mari, Kye, and my parents.  Those four people are the core of my existence... if something goes to hell with them, the world might start to crumble, but I wouldn't hop out on a line any faster for one of them than I would for someone else, because I'm already doing the best I can for total strangers without expecting more than a smile when they realize something in their day didn't go to shit.  It doesn't have to have anything to do with me... and my help isn't anything to do with that unconditional love... it's a given.  I just DO it... and so do my folks, so I guess I learned it from somewhere.  

I love the way someone's eyes sparkle when I do something they like.  That's what life is all about, so is it so bad to avoid things that might not cause that spark when seeing them?  I honestly don't care about the repercussions to me from any successful or failed friendship... what I care about and what worries me is that if I do something to upset them, will anyone else show up that can make their eyes spark?  I like Matt because he makes Ammi's eyes light up, and she deserves that...  My mother would say it differently, but she feels the same.  If she stops wanting anything to do with me again, she won't be miserable like she was so many times before, and that's a DEEP comfort.  I see the same kind of spark in my parent's eyes when I come home, and I love it, it makes me spend far more time than I meant to doing absolutely nothing with them instead of my work.  Maybe it's wrong to try to stir up that sparkle in anyone I meet but... what's the POINT if I don't?  I know some witty comment made by a total stranger can make my day, even if I never see them again.  It's not about the stranger with the comment, it's not about being remembered or any such...  It's just that I like it if I can make someone even just a tiny bit happier somehow.  

I'm not sure if it has anything to do with friendship.  Often enough, that IS how I meet people who become friends, but I'm not actively seeking new people.  If they come, they come, if they don't, I continue happily on with my life.  I don't care either way.  Is this equilibrium the key to happiness?  

I learned the hard way that people don't care to hear me go on and on about something in my head.  It gets you in trouble, because no one believes it's the sheer benevolence you meant it as.  I learned to sick more by the ""don't ask, don't tell"" philosophy, and it's works.  I can skim topics until I get somewhere they like, and maybe I'll dig up that spark.  I'll mention this or that about me and if they pursue, then maybe it'll be a friendship, or an aquaintance.  If they don't, I won't trouble them with junk they don't give a shit about.  I'm not sure if this idea is self-deprecating or not...  But it makes me more sure that anyone who associates with me gives a damn about whatever topic on some level and I'm not just annoying them.  I mean, me and Kye can go on and on for hours about whatever, but the foundation is already laid down for that equal free-for-all, even if the other doesn't actively care, we still want to know and hear about it if the other noticed... if that makes any sense.  I haven't met anyone else who wouldn't be annoyed by that eventually... Mari likes it on some days to a certain level, and my mother enjoys it when she's got the time, but... yeah.  I suppose that's what best friends are in essence, or something.  

I think Berg believes all the random crap hurts me on a deeper level than I realize, and I'm honestly just curious to know if she's right.  I used to bottle up, but... I don't think I'm bottling up so much as I'm just not taking it seriously.  Maybe I'm a lot healthier than she thinks, and come what may, I'm mostly ready...  but maybe I really am still back at the drawing board.  I suppose I'll find out eventually.  The idea that I might really be clueless and disillusioned isn't upsetting, somehow.  I suppose that's old hat too.  The only arenas where it would really upset me anymore are about those four people I mentioned before, and I'm deep enough with them that I know I'm not wrong there.

Maybe it'll be more than those four people eventually...  I care about so many others, some very deeply, but the entire structure of my existence isn't based off of them.  They could come to hate me and it would be awful, but I wouldn't have to completely scrap what I have and rebuild...  God, I had to scrap and rebuild my psyche how many times before I turned eighteen?  Is the fire not burning anymore just scars?  I never minded scars, to be honest, but I wonder if they are proud marks of experience and lessons learned or just signs of trauma hinting at the damaged final result?  I'm far more inclined to believe the former, but I can't help but wonder if there's truth in the latter.  

I just...  I'm here to enjoy myself, but I'm REALLY alive to help people, I think.  My happiness matters because you can't give what you don't have, and because I'm one of those people who needs that spark too... and looking for it in everyone else helps me find it in me.  I'm still lost and confused, and I imagine I will be for years to come, if not for the rest of my life on some level... and that's okay.  Giving happiness doesn't mean you have to be perfect, and I'm learning that, though perfection in some form or fashion certainly smooths the path.  I'll simply be me... and that's all anyone should ever want of me, or something.

One of these days I'll be more concise in my soul searching and epiphanies."

"event","Life is odd...  Looking back to the path of how we got to today always intrigues me on some level but when I start identifying possible crossroads...  It's not exactly scary, per se, but I will admit to it being unnerving.  

I was muttering about everything to Berg today because she wanted to try to get a better handle on my psyche before we dove into all the Reiki stuff.  Then somehow Kye and I got on the subject of how we came to be friends, and therefore everything with Yira...  How we got here and why, how things might have gone differently, and would might have been currently...  And it hit on some level that I affected Kye's psyche somewhat, not just the other way around.  

It occurs to me that this shouldn't be a new idea, but there you have it.  

Not going to go into details there because that's not my place to say in an entry I'm not going to bother hiding...  just...  All the crossroads, you know?  I don't regret the past, it's those choices and actions that brought me to where I am, and despite all the troubles, I wouldn't trade them for anything.  The pain is worth the rewards brought, just to see a real smile in another person, a genuine appreciation, is enough to go through the fire... and the fire ceased to hurt years ago.  I'm not sure if that means I'm burned down and don't realize it yet, or if it ceased to be a fire when it stopped hurting, but I'm more inclined to believe the latter.  

I'm not sure if it's unhealthy that I automatically expect scorn and dislike from anyone I meet, and that this doesn't bother me in the slightest.  It's something to kinda snort at in amusement and wave a hand to in a dismissive gesture, because it doesn't matter.  I give away whatever might please someone when I can just because I love it when I can get that smile that means their day went a bit better than it otherwise might have, and I don't expect anything back.  It's kinda surprising when I do get something back... I really have no idea what I'm supposed to do with that.  

So... I'm a people pleaser without benefits?  I mean, I get them sometimes, but the only person I'd expect benefits from would be, like, Mari, and that's not even vaguely in the same light.  

Berg says I give everything away too easy... she's worried about the worn down aspect, and she has something of a point.  I'm rather improved from the whipping boy I used to be, but I'll readily admit I haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  I refuse to put up with the absolute shit I would have taken without batting a lash when I was younger... I avoid instances where it might happen in a regular kind of way, but even so, the idea that I might be hurt from someone lashing out at me in the same way is... deeply amusing.  It just... wouldn't hit home, kind of thing, and it's always kinda sad and funny to see someone trying so hard to be vicious when it's completely ineffectual.  

I wear my heart on my sleeve and open up to whoever cares to look... Sassy called it transparency, or something, and the idea of doing it terrifies most people because they see it as pure vulnerability... while it's more along the lines of safety in my mind, because you just make it so there's nothing worth hiding.  It's all been done, kind of thing... I honestly don't think someone could hurt me emotionally anymore.  Not in any serious kind of way, anyhow.  There's always pain on some level, but the kind that can cause you to break down...  That's not a risk from anyone but Mari or Kye, and that's not really a threat.  There's something about having had the people closest to you damn you and take you back over and over again that just makes you stop caring about if you're ditched or not, because it quit being the end of the world after the twentieth time it happened.  Everything's kinda anticlimactic after being spurned so many times even to the point of utter alienation, after so much physical pain to boot, so that you just kinda roll your eyes and go back to what you were doing because there's submitting to what emotions someone expects when they hurt you just isn't worth the time and effort.  It's not going to change anyone's opinion of you, it's not going to change what happened, so keep your notes on not getting into that situation or making an ill choice that caused it again, and move on, because no one else cares what you think, so why bother brooding?  

I'm not suggesting other people take up this mindframe.... just noting that it's become my own.  I'm curious as to how much of it Berg thinks is inappropriate and wants to teach me out of.  I think she believes I'm worse off than I am, and do admit that there's a chance she's right, but I doubt she realizes how much progress I HAVE made in the process of coping.  It'll become more clear for both of us the deeper we go, so it's little more than idle curiosity, excitement as to what will get dug up... and kinda pleasant to have a different opinion on it by someone with training, instead of my shot in the dark method.  

Unconditional love...  Kye has a point abut how that's the key to good relationships.  I kinda throw it out to anyone I come close to, and it makes me sad when I come across those who say I understand them better than any of their friends, because I really DON'T know them when they say it like that.  It makes me sad when someone is so hungry for it because it hasn't been given consistently, but I learned the hard way that I need to stay passive in a relationship and let them take as much as they want before seeing if they want what's attached.  No one appreciates a random mother hen; you have to either earn your rights to be thought of even in passing, or step in and give everything you want to before dashing back out before they're over the shock.  Leave the option of being found if they decide they want to find you, be ready to step in again if you think it might be necessary again... but I don't make the moves for a closer relationship until I'm sought, anymore.  If you care too much, you are assumed to have ulterior motives, and in the end will cause more harm than good.  Down the line you can let them realize the full extent of the unconditional is there for the taking, and if they like the idea, then you can actually dote as much as you want to...  but very few people enjoy being swept off their feet for no reason, because the idea that there might not be a true reason is foreign... or something.  

I have the good luck that my parents have always been completely unconditional about love.  I also have the same luck about Mari, who I found surprisingly early in life.  And I can't begin to describe how it feels when my mother confides in me how happy she is that I found such a true friend as Kye so early in life, considering the fact that she only recently found the same sort with Brooke (well, recent if the last 6 years count, anyhow).  That's probably why the fire of scorn doesn't seem to exist anymore...  It can all burn down and everything will be okay, because the core is still there.  I'll be affected, of course, but... nothing terrifies me anymore.  Everything has gone to complete shit so many times that it's not upsetting beyond the moment, and even in the moment, it's more annoying than hurtful.  

The wondering over crossroads is more a matter of debating who I would be had Mari not come into my life, had Kye and I had not formed our bond for a variety of different reasons.  Mari has been with me since the beginning of true pain, and Kye came shortly after.  I got them when I had no one very close to me, because of all the fights...  I didn't think I might really be desirable before Mari.  When my health went downhill again and again I was often half convinced he would tire of the trouble I brought...  I suppose I never had that fear by with Kye by the time she and I quit having a pissing contest and started having a friendship, but my relationship with her is of a different nature than with Mari, for all that it's just as meaningful and, in reality, more time-consuming, lmao.  Acceptance of each other despite this or that problem was never questioned, probably just by the nature of how we were before becoming close.  

The death of pride is a hard thing, though... I used to be fairly strong, physically, and I took pride in being able to take full care of myself.  To admit to the one you want to share the rest of your life with that you can't do something so simple as change your clothes or open a jar/bottle by yourself... that's hard.  It's hard to believe anyone would want you when you're disgusted with yourself, even when you KNOW better.  When you try to prove you're fine by taking a walk then you break down crying because you can't make yourself walk the short way back... you have to finish damning yourself before you can begin to consider calling and asking for someone to come find you... especially when you only have a vague idea of where you really are.  

The times when I would scream in pain if he touched me, because the fibro took up residence in my skin and every touch, even from my clothes, BURNED... part of his way of handling it was to take up the role of taking care of me, protecting and comforting me... when suddenly he couldn't even hold me as I sobbed, I was terrified he was going to give up.  When I hit the points where all I could manage to do was sleep and focus on something as all-encompassing and mind-numbing as video games for hours on end, then I woke him up in the middle of the night because I went into a twitch fit and hit him on accident and he'd hold me tight to I couldn't hurt myself...  I'll never forget the night that he and my mother held me as I sobbed wildly, thrashing every which way, blacking out for a couple seconds periodically, knowing on some level that those sounds my mom was making were words but not able to quite put the logic to them... as my father stood in the bedroom door, looking on in horror as he realized there wasn't anything he could do.  ...I think I was apologizing as I was doing it... if I wasn't aloud, I was thinking it, that they were losing the sleep because they had heard me sobbing as I finally lost what was left of my control at 2am.  

On some level I expected Mari to run soon after that, because I wasn't getting better... he had no reason to have to deal with my problems, it wasn't fair.  I remember trying to tell him that it was okay, I wouldn't hold it against him, he was perfectly within his rights, I couldn't promise I would ever be who I had been before pain in every fiber of my being began to define my life...  and him demanding to know if THAT was what I had been brooding about for the past few weeks, and that if I honestly thought he was going to go anywhere then I was a fool.  He always read me for little bits of body language... would take things from me and insist on opening them before I could spend the five minutes trying then following ten trying to make myself ask, would offer to help me stand almost as soon as I bit my lip, realizing that there was no way I could roll my weight so that coming back to my feet wouldn't be incredibly painful.  He would tease me that he never had any qualms whatsoever with helping me undress, then when I pointed out that half of it was that I knew it wasn't THAT painful but I still couldn't make myself DO it, he would note seriously that obviously I COULD do it, but he would rather I didn't HAVE to do something that hurt, if he could solve the problem just by helping...  and eventually asking became less of an ordeal.  He likes to joke that I only keep him around for opening jars, and acts all pouty when I DO open something on my own, chasing me about, whining that I've robbed his life of purpose...  

He has some of the stupidest jokes you'll ever hear, you just want to groan, but he can always make me smile, and he cares... we're different enough that we complement each other well to boot, even while we communicate so well that we don't ever really fight.  We get annoyed with each other and sometimes we need to sit and talk something out, but it's never the stupid shit you see in most couples, my parents included.  He and Kye get along just fine, and that's important too, despite the fact that he came before she did.  Kye and I communicate a bit differently, but it balances out to complement perfectly in a different fashion.  Despite being so far away, she's always there for me, and I try to return the favor... whether it's important or just muttering about our characters while we do mundane tasks from the day to day.  It means absolutely nothing and everything at the same time, if that makes sense...  My mother and I are getting to have the same kind of thing the older I get as she asserts less control over me...

And all it boils down to is love that's given no matter what state any of us are in...  even something as stupid as Laura coming over to play video games at my house while I fall asleep on the couch.  Even if I'm in shit condition, it's the time spent, or even not the time spent, just the consideration of the company and letting the other do whatever they damn well please... and that's really convoluted, but that situation ends in us both kinda doting on each other even though we're not technically spending time together if I'm unconscious.  Laura's one of those few people who never thought I had a bad reason to want to sweep her off her feet and show her the world in the palm of my hand... she just enjoys my company and realizes that I enjoy hers and hat's all there is to it.  I think she finds it amusing that I enjoy trying to please her as much as I do, seeing as we both know she'd be perfectly happy if I did nothing of the sort.  I've developed a similar kind of bond with Ammi now that we're out of high school, though we interact differently because Ammi has seen the world in other lights, she wasn't such a blank slate, the way Laura was when she came to college.  It's nice to have friends who don't get offended or suspicious if I just give things out... I like giving gifts for absolutely no reason, I'm generally ecstatic when I DO have a reason.  

We all just... exist together... and that's all we need.  We do all the other stuff for the hell of it, but that knowledge of love is enough, whether or not we're spending much time together...  Anything can happy and everything will all be okay because of those bonds... and there are more of them than I mentioned, as should be obvious from Laura  and Ammi popping up out of nowhere at the end of the post, Kye and Mari and the folks are absolute constants, everything else is steady but full attention comes in fits and starts depending on the season.  

So no matter what happens... everything is happy, you know?  I'm becoming a better person day by day, more balanced, more real and less child... and the absence of fear is amazingly good for your health."

"event","^_^  I slept in today because I don't have any day classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays after dropping Physics, and just cuddled the cat and puppies until eleven something.  Well, no, I woke up enough to get Mari up and headed to work before eight, but then it was back to bed.  Spent the day lounging about reading a fairly good fanfic and kinda picking up, cleaned the cat box, organized clothes, vacuumed the living room...  I need to fold clothes, but I also need to pack for my weekend trip home and do my pre-lab for Anatomy lab at 8 tomorrow morning (no sleeping in for me tomorrow, I can sleep while getting remicade done...).  

Anyhow, called Kye and was being chattery like we generally do, then Mari called and was all...  happily/openly being sneaky, if that makes sense.  Like, it was obvious he was up to something, but he wasn't gonna tell me what... and noted that I didn't need to worry about dinner tonight.  

Anyhow, I went to class and was feeling kinda like crap... that's been happening more and more, lately.  I think it's largely the time of day, or something; the class runs 5-9 TWR, and... okay, I actually have no idea, maybe my body's still trying to unwind from what I put it through when the semester just started.  I REALLY felt like I needed to go have a fit yesterday to relieve tension, but I couldn't get away from class long enough to do it, but then she let us out early... and nicely enough, the worst stages of it were gone by then.  Anyhow, was getting a headache and feeling lightheaded today, AND was really sleepy despite sleeping in.  Called Mari on my break to give him a timeframe I would be out by, because it varies a bit day to day, and he was still being all happy sneaky.  Kinda just came home at 8:40 (said I'd be home at 8:30 at the latest) and no one was home... called Mari only to find out that he was about to come in the front door, and he whined at me about how I was supposed to call BEFORE I came home... 

...and asked me to hide out in the bedroom for 15 minutes or so, maybe take a nap, so I a) couldn't see what he was bringing in, and b) they could start dinner.  Apparently Brian (Mari's newfound very close/best friend that is actually rather cool and fun to hang out with, imo) was in on this too.  So I cuddled with Exile and called Kye again, and we chattered about this and that for a while, and ended up hanging up a couple minutes before Mari came to get me.  

Brian can cook rather well, so Mari had gotten him to make salmon and pasta salad and caeser salad.  And Mari had decided that we severely lacked in dusty candles and candle stick holders, and we needed to have them dusty and about but only used once, at least (you can see why we get along with that logic, ne?) so we had a candlelight dinner...  

And he got me yellow roses.  ^_^  I've really been hoping he'd get me flowers for a while now, Matt's been getting them so often for Ammi... and he finally did!  That sounds so horribly girly and shallow, but it really mattered when I was working so hard and we were hardly seeing each other while I was still doing physics, because it was like he didn't care, we couldn't spend much actual time together... but yeah, I love yellow roses.  Whenever we get arround to the wedding thing we're going to have yellow roses everywhere.  He's gotten me red before but that's just... weird, lmao.  My father always got my mom two dozen red roses just out of the blue, all the time growing up... and that's her color, you know?  It's, like, too serious... not that Mari and my relationship isn't serious (what else could you call it, honestly?), but the tone of it... I don't know, the deep red roses that are the popular thing for guys to give always strikes me as so formal/solemn that I'm terrified of messing it up.  I'm sure it's some kind of association I just tagged from my childhood because of the huge set-ups Da sent Munna all the time.

The yellow are just... sweet, and they suit me; forget the flower love language.  My absolute favorites are the yellow with the pink tips, though these ones are awesome too, more of a pale orangy color base with apricot edges.  Shit, he got me flowers, it wouldn't matter if they were black, it's just the extra bit of thought and effort... he knows I've had it a little rough and am just getting my breath back, you know?  

*takes a deep breath from them, all happy*  Maybe when we finally settle and have our own house, down the road, we can keep a rose garden... they mostly take care of themselves, and when I was a little girl we always had so many that we could just keep a bouquet in the house, then as I got older we just kept enough to look pretty on the walk up to the front door.  We had a ton of different colors too...  I would have been bewildered by the idea of wanting a rose garden when I was in middle school, but the idea of having roses about in some way really appeals, especially when I realize I wouldn't want to plant any deep reds... just playful colors.  Mari would probably want to coax briars into growing on the walls and that would be just fine too, even though I think they only come in dark reds... security and all that.  It's just... I'm not THAT into greenery, especially since I've found myself to be more allergic to the tropical kind as I get older, but not from roses... and the ones Mari gets me aren't much of anything like the kind Da always got my mom, in shape as well as color, so the association is really loose and it's comfortable...  

*grins* Though really, Da and Mari have waaaay too much in common, some days; what does Freud say?  You want to marry your parent of the opposite sex?  I'm not much of anything like Mari's mother, but my mother likes to poke at me that I DO realize I'm marrying my father whenever Mari does something like get lost getting to the house I'd lived in for over a year because he got distracted, and is consequently forty minutes late.  There's a lot more to it than that, of course, but that would take a while to explain...  and really, I just came on to gab happily about having gotten flowers.  ^_^"

"event","Okay, I'm not actually so annoyed by now, having given the rant in full to Kyle and Laura and pieces of it to other people who I'm sure could care less, but my EMT-Basic teacher has proven herself to be a contradictory obnoxious woman who is entirely in her own world without a care (in terms of teaching, she seems like she's kickass at her job as an intermediate).  One of those teachers who wants you to remember her wording more than the concept, and will mark you wrong if said wording is wrong.  My main issue is that she's insisting I learn and use the WRONG anatomical terms for her class (""midline"" instead of midsagittal plane, ""lateral cut"" instead of frontal or coronal plane - and I know that most anyone who reads this doesn't know the words anyhow, bt suffice to say that the latter just doesn't work logically).  If I answer with the CORRECT terms, she WILL mark me wrong.  

Okay, I can get over this, Out of the thirty something students only one person other than myself is pre-med.  It annoys the hell out of me, mind you, but I understand.  The extraneous connect the dots that teachers and similarly minded students in my other classes appreciate have no place there, I get it.  However, then you have a bunch of people who have NOT had any or barely any anatomy eduication in the class getting ALL of the basics today and that is a LOT if you're not familiar with the subject, especially adding in that she went over all the major systems and their functions in some detail.  This is the pace we have been moving at, though, so that's fine too.  However, a fair number of students are completely new to the ideas... and the test for the material covering the first three weeks of class, including today's anatomy lessons?  Yeah, that's tomorrow.  She's not giving them ANY time to absorb it.  *rolls eyes*

But as for the title of the post and the actual amusingness of it, I was muttering about all this in greater detail to Laura, and she had to go have lunch ( because she's in China and I think it's Wednesday there...) and came back.  There is a lot from me taken out of this excerpt because it would be detached and redundant, but yes:

"event","I'm really glad that I fell in love early in life and didn't go through all sorts of hell in that arena before figuring it out.  I really am.  However, trying to figure out exactly how to keep everything hunky dory for ongoing education for BOTH of us is fuckin' psychotic.  

Note #1: Mari is no longer sure he wants to go into medicine, is behind even if he does, and isn't sure what he might want to do instead.  He is taking this semester off to work and try to get his head on straight.  

I really have no problem with this; I want him to be happy, not for him to go into the same field as me; it's just that if it is the same field, it's easier to organize.  He's been muttering about maybe going into engineering, which I could see him absolutely loving, but he's unsure, etc.  Perfectly fine, if frustrating because he's not even focusing much on it right now and trying to figure it out, he's avoiding it, which is often a favorite pastime.  *sighs* Annoying as hell, but I understand, so I've just been trying to prod more action into him.

Note #2: Medical school is difficult to get into, and you need the best competative edge you can pull off.

This is especially true if I need to be applying to several schools at once and getting accepted into as many of those as I can so that hopefully where I get accepted and where Mari gets accepted overlap, because if not... shit.  I'm also getting REALLY annoyed as FUCK with people who are all, ""Just go and do it, boys shouldn't matter"" because, yes, he may be a ""boy"", but I have every intention of marrying that boy in the vaguely near future (which means something under 5 years, probably), and hey, I don't WANT to push and pull him unless I don't have a choice, and I certainly don't want to lose him.  The other end of this is that I compromised with him a few years back that I would do the small town thing for him (SUU, our current university) and he would do the big city thing for me, down the line.  

Anyhow, the competition thing can be solved in a number of ways, some of which I'm already into.  I work for the school's disability center seasonally, reading books onto a tape for the blind and dyslexic students.  I've done volunteer note-taking for a class, and I volunteer at Valley hospital from time to time.  I'm taking EMT-Basic training now, which I should be able to work as because I've knocked out most of my classes already, I just need to go through the cores of physics, chemistry, and come bio classes, and because I have THREE years left from fucking up with chemistry (classes are only offered in order, during certain times of year), I can spread those out a little more thinly, so working and doing school at the same time shouldn't be an issue.  Those things show a commitment to the style of work, a show of empathy/care or something too.  If I keep in EMT and progress for that long, it'll REALLY look good because it shows I already have experience and still really want what I want.  On a similar vein, I'd like to go to South Africa or Equador or something and work in a clinic for a bit, not just because it'd look DAMN good, but because that really interests me...  I could easily see myself happily trotting along with ""Doctors Without Borders"" down the line.  For diversity, I'm not just a geeky science type, I have my writing (which I need to FINISH) and my locksmithing, so it's obvious that I looked around, I'm not an egghead... and yes, I still want to go into medicine, not something else.  

Note #3: I really doubt I'll be able to get into an international internship to work in a clinic somewhere while at SUU.  Oregon State, however, has connections to get those kinds of things put through.  Also, going to Oregon State would greatly increase my chances of getting into Oregon Health & Sciences University, which is an absolutely kickass med school.  Adding to that, Kye is up there, and going so far wouldn't be so hard with the support network of her and hers to fall back to if I really need it at any point.  The weather and all-around landscape is also gorgeous, and God, I REALLY don't want to spend another winter in snowbanks and ice... give me a few years and I might be excited by the prospect, but I'm just sooo sick of mountain winters.  I love rain, but snow sucks.  

Note #4: Oregon State is in Corvallis, about 2 hours' drive from Portland, where the med school is.  I have three years left, and it's a quarter system, so it's feasible that Mari could finish at the same time as me, but it starts banking on chances more than I like.  This would be true for going anywhere, though, and I think we could part ways for a semester or so if we really had to if I was only accepted somewhere further away, but...  

You can see where this gets complicated, right?  Trying to keep us going where we want in the same city is CRAZY.  Ugh, I'm not sure what to do..."

"event","Mm, Daddy just called me and was all bouncy happy proud of himself because he's pretty sure he got Ammi a job, where she'll have good benefits, decent pay, and plenty of hours...  He was just muttering all happily at me about how he was planning to set her up with this and that; Da can be so incredibly adorable, and I daresay the mood is catching.  Benefits means she gets to see a doc, and that's happy.  ^_^  She called shortly after Da and was happy too, but with maybe 10% of the exuberance, lmao.  

Really though, it's all good...  Working hard to keep up in my classes, but I really like them, even the physics.  physics, anatomy, drugs & behavior, and emt basic.  Not so much time for other stuff, but I think I'm going back out of a ""MUST have computer!"" stage, because not having loads free time to kill on computer or games isn't bothering me at all.  Instead I'm kicking ASS in class, happily asking every dimension of question relating back to medicine in class and the teachers seem to have the same happy/excited mood...  I'm getting into peer mentoring once I work out where my free time is, and the idea excites me even though I KNOW it means I won't be able to write as much... God, I can hardly wait until I can get into the back of an ambulance...

There was a reason I decided to go into medicine, huh?  It evokes this bubblyness because it's going to really be important however unnoticed the work may go.  I've never really craved fame, even the want to publish is a want to get people to enjoy themselves; pen name, anyone?  I mean, I won't truly hide behind it, but it would be kinda like Robert Jordan where yeah, he's said his real name a good number of times, you can find the information... but no one really cares.  Obviously I don't expect THAT kind of recognition, but he was just the first author to come to mind that I actually know enough about who uses a pen name in the way I meant.  If someone gets curious, then they could find it out, but the point isn't anything about me.

I'm really a people pleaser at heart, huh?  Here I am muttering about Da being adorable for being all happy to give whatever he can, and my mother is similar if not quite on the same level of exuberance...  I get it from somewhere, you think?  *grins*

Munna's recovering pretty well, and I got to hang out with Brooke the other day and she's just as awesome as ever...  The house is driving me nuts but it's not AS bad, and this translates into me happily cleaning with aforementioned lack of free time instead of screwing around.  I hurt a bit, and I'll keep an eye on it so Chris can keep hacking at the exactly right med cocktail, but it's not bad...  I really don't care to notice it, or something?  If it starts to bug me I could, like, TAKE my ultram.  Doesn't matter when you're happy?  

I pulled a tendon the last week that's still hurting like a bitch (in fair part due to the meds, I'm sure) but that's just hilarious instead of sad because I did it from wearing the stupidest shoes EVER that no one could even see the heels on because I was wearing pants that went to the floor...  I seem to have redeveloped the dangly earring liking that i dropped in... 9th grade?  Either way, it's just fun because I DO have 3 holes in each ear, so it's still not the norm but I can play...  Brooke was poking at me about being femenine a bit ago, but I'm just running on impulse...  if it's less androgynous than my usual fair, I could really care less.  My mom got the idea at some point that I had cracked something and insisted I go see my father at work on Sunday, however ridiculous the idea that I might have broken my foot wearing cutsie little heels...  okay, if I had I would be laughing a LOT harder, because that's just so awesome it HURTS... or something... but yeah, after rolling his eyes and reassuring me that nothing was borken, my father conspiratorily lead me into the doctor's lounge, noting that now I could come in and steal all the food and no one would know it was me! in full fashion of the loud whisper and shit-eating grin...  

And then I hung out and watched him and one of his partners read a bunch of films while they flicked me shit about the literally hundreds of capsules I must consume for my detox of Avara, which is what was making my hair fall out, because I'm can't mix the powder into something like normal people without being so disgusted by the taste that I'm facing severe nausea.  I was happily explaining something I learned in the reading room in fair detail to Cherese (girl I sit with in EMT) yesterday, though, so I feel good... Cherese is fun.  She has hair envy though, lmao, despite how it's been coming out *sniggers*.  I met her because she complimented me on it the first day, then went into something of a rant when she found out it was natural, followed by all sorts of weird questions about medical conditions she's heard run in families with red hair...  She's more thirsty for any random bit of info about anything than I am, and all ecstatic to have me as a source of said random shit, medical or otherwise...  She has a hard time remembering things, so I've been helping her with little things here and there for the class, and she's just... so very open.  It's refreshing to meet someone so candid.  And little common courtesy things I do for her always take her by surprise, which is kinda cute, for all that it makes me sad at the same time that she hadn't thought someone would do the odd little things you just DO for a friend.  

So... the question return to is the mood really that catching, am I really that excited about absolutely mundane things, or am I just that sleep deprived?  *makes shushing motions* Don't tell my doc the last one, she'll give me hell...  *breaks into giggles*"

My mom's going into surgery again...  this is going to be the 10th surgery she's had since I turned eight.  Her immune system is shot.  She used to be like me, she got sick once a year, but she catches every little thing now...

...and the last time she had surgery, she stopped breathing.  Her heart didn't stop, they think they just put her a little too far under with the meds...  but God...

I'm TRYING not to think 'what if', I really am...  I was doing okay...  then I found out about the breathing today, when she snapped about how my Dad would be at the center so I needed to watch my sister...  How the hell am I supposed to take Jenai to see the damn Underdog movie when I have no idea what's happening?  I burst into tears when she told me and she was quick to try to calm me down, the five-year-old asking what was wrong and being told that Mom had scared me, then demanding to know what it was because she wasn't scared and us just shaking our heads at her...  Munna telling me that Da would have his cell phone with him so he could call me, and the only thought that's running through my head is so what, he can call me to tell me RIGHT when it all goes down the drain?  I shadow that surgeon sometimes, I WANT to know which anesthesiologist is going to have her... fuck, I wish I could BE there...

Everything's going to be fine, I know it will be... but I don't know what I'll do if I'm wrong, and my thoughts keep turning back to that."

"event","*considers her brush and comb* Not to sound like a scared little girl... but I'm really starting to worry.  

On the other hand, the severe nausea seems to have mostly cleared up.  I had a bad bout last night, but I think that was something I ate mixed with a lack of eating (convoluted, ne?).  It's gotten a LOT better since I switched back to methotrexate, and pain is less of an issue too in general.  I'm worried that my knees and hips might be worse in terms of condition, it's hard to impossible to find a painfree way to stand up if i sit on the floor, most of the time.  However, there's generally someone nearby that I can give a pointed look and they'll help me so there's one way out of that; if I'm alone I can obviously do it myself, but hey, if I can get a freebie on that one I'll take it.  

Standing up is a lot harder than it looks.  It takes coordination of a series of muscles, and puts a shitload of pressure on the joints from the hip down, especially if you try doing it fast.  It seems entirely negligable, since we've been doing it since we were tiny... but I'm starting to appreciate exactly how amazing toddlers are.  Jenai's five now, and she has so much energy...  and the flying leaps off the jungle gym she does scares the shit out of me, but some days I think the kid is made of steel.  The next minute, however, she's screaming at one of the dogs for scratching her, or insisting that I hurt her when I did her seatbelt even though I didn't touch her, so yeah.  I can never decide what I think of her in gymnastics...  I'd gotten to really miss gymnastics during high school and was planning on getting somewhat into it again, getting a little into parkour... and then Congratulations!  You have a chronic debilitating disease!  *shakes head* I've taken her a couple times, and I'm glad the kiddo's into something she likes, and she's really good for her age group...  

But I can't bring myself to admit to my mother that it depresses the shit out of me to see all these kids flying all over the place at this school.  I just try to come up with a good excuse to not be the one to take Jen, or give my mother a really skeptical look when she's happily asking if I want to go to one of the little shows the kids put on periodically because it really IS a bunch of uncoordinated 3-7 year olds bouncing about...  That one's completely true, the shows bit has no appeal to me whatsoever.  If she stays in this I'll start going to them when she's a little older, and it'll be fine, because I'll be focusing on... on the acts, the skill of it, not the open mats with kids everywhere.  When I'm there I just want to run and try it all so bad... and I know I'll never be able to, not if I want my body to last me well through the years.  Everyone always told me not to be so fast to grow up, because then there's no time to play, there's the burden of responsibilities...  and I really don't mind any of that.  The only thing I miss is that ability to be reckless physically... and not have it bounce back to bite me in the ass.  I miss being able to run and pace for an hour or two when musing for my stories, and not having aching knees and ankles for several days after.  

Wow, I sound like an old woman, ne?  Kids these days... *rolls eyes*

My terror of developing cowardice issues that could rule me keeps them from getting too far, while the issues themselves usually keep me from getting upset and therefore rebellious and in turn reckless.  I'm trying to avoid damage of any sort, avoid pain if it's within reasonable bounds of going out of my way... and then of course I do something stupid like go bowling with the guys and my hand's fucked up for several weeks...  But I had fun, so I don't really care, it was worth it.  Pros and cons, and.. happy mediocrity?  That's called being content, right?  Trying for something of a healthy medium here and I think I'm mostly succeeding.  I definitely have more than a few kinks to work out, but I suppose that's what you spend your whole life figuring out. It would be boring if I had it ALL figured out already.  What would be the point?  

I'm certainly glad I haven't walked into any of the stupid shit I see so many people currently coping with, or coping with the aftereffects of...  Mari was telling me about one of his coworker's serious marriage ups and downs and just... people do some amazingly stupid shit.  In a lot of ways, I appreciate my shit history with my friends because it taught me where to draw the line...  People can dole out more shit than I could ever have imagined when I was younger, and I will never be anybody's damn emotional whipping boy again.  There's a difference between being there for a friend and sitting through day after day of alternately being risen up and left for the vulchers.  I've learned that a thick skin is a good thing to have, so long as it's a coat that you only put on when the weather demands... or maybe now and again just because it looks really cute with those shoes.  

As superficial as that sounds, I hope it gets my point across; sometimes sweet and fluffy really needs to shove it.  I'm a compassionate person, sweet when the occasion calls for it, but I'm anything but fluffy.  I can play at fluffy if need be, but the more I'm out and about... the more I feel like worn brown leather.  Comfortable and casual, tasteful but not really fashionable, not dramatic but mostly blending in instead, a bit roughed up but still classy... for every day conditions but still really good quality.  I appreciate the things I've seen and been through because they've made me who I am and despite all the shit, I like me.  My parents like me, and my best friend and my guy wouldn't like me if I was anything but what I am.  Well, no, they'd probably appreciate me getting better so I was as good as I used to be at physical so forth and wasn't bitching about said problems all the time, but I hope to get better about that as time goes on...  

I like to think of the arthritis, the pain meds and the issues involved with them, the treatments and issues involved there, the periodic depression and fear of the future I face in terms of eventual disability as...  It's just one more set of trials forming me into the woman God means me to be.  I'm going to be useful to people, important somehow even if no one remembers my name, just because I was here...  I don't care if no one remembers me, that's not the point.  I just want to make a difference to someone, anyone, in some way.  I've already done it many times and I do it now, I'll continue to do it my whole life...  Even when I've fucked up before and left a bad memory... that's how we learn, I suppose, and move on to become better people.  I have no regrets and if I died now it would be okay, if that makes sense.  I don't want to die for a very long time, mind you, there's too much to do and I love life in every aspect just by itself.  Also, if something happened to me I think Mari might need to be moved so someone was constantly watching him so he didn't do something stupid, and it scares me to think of what my other loved ones would go through because of it...  What I mean is that I don't fear it in the sense of I don't have that common need to ""leave my mark"" because I HAVE left it... even if it only exists in those people I've touched as I walk down the path of life, even if most of them will never remember anything about me.  I mattered in some small way to many and very much to a few... and that's true, real.  I don't need anything flashy.  A little bit of flash to take out of the closet now and again, or to sit on a dusty mantle is nice to have... but I'm just as happy without.  

*looks back at the very long post*  I came on here because I was starting to freak out about hair loss from the meds...  But despite not having muttered about it, I feel better.  It'll probably turn out to be nothing major anyway... and as I told Kyle, I could pull off going with a shaved head.  I really am NOT keen on the idea, but I could manage it; it's all about attitude.  When it comes to your body, so long as you're okay with it, everyone else has to be, or else they're either A) not who they want to be, or B) not worth your time.  *grins*  I'm too happy with myself to not have the attitude I would need.  So... no matter what happens, it's always going to be okay, mm?"

"event","Mm, let's aim for more consistent posting that's happy as well as broody, so Kye can get creative with the background again.  *laughs*

Yesterday was all-around pleasant... I got up and actually did my make-up, played with the pups, and got to have a realtively low stress hour or two before bolting off to my Genetics final in time for some last minute group studying in the main of the science center.  That was anything BUT stressfree, but then, when it came to the actual test... I had seriously overstudied.  It was really easy, and I have high hopes for my overall grade.  I SHOULD have a B in Genetics lecture now, if I did my math right, and I either have a B+ or A- in Genetics lab, depending on whether or not she'll bring me up from my 89.4.  I'm trying to cover my ass so I don't have to take the class again and also so that I hopefully don't lose my scholarship for failing Trig.  I'm retaking Trig first thing this summer, so maybe I can talk them into letting me have a probation period or something if my GPA drops below the marker.  

I had the sheer brilliance *coughs* stupidity *coughs* to start the actual writing on my Adolescent Development paper last night, along with all 15 of my 30 something question online quizzes, AND my partway done take-home final for the class... all of which was due today.  I managd it... but I still ended up staying up until six something this morning working on the paper and final and trying to cement a few facts for my Evolution final, which will be at 3:00pm today.  Slept through the first half of the presentations in Adolescent today, apologized to the teacher and told her my alarm hadn't woken me up (excluding the fact that I had a hard time waking up because I'd barely slept).  She was all cheerful and answered a couple random questions before suggesting I have some of the donuts one of the presenters brought (my presentation was a couple weeks ago).  

I'm really going to miss having Dr. Berg as a teacher... not only does she have a seeming phobia of tests (which means everything is take-home) and is a general easy A, but she's has a kickass personality and can put the right spin on a topic to keep you interested.  She lets people, myself included, get away with far too much crap... but I genuinely like her as a person.  My next psychology class is with Marsha Garber next fall, and I'm really looking forward to having her again too.  She's very similar to Berg in a lot of ways, both in personality and teaching style, and also, my minor will be finished after that class.  I'll probably end up taking another psych class or two out of curiosity down the line, but it'll be nice to have that requirement off my chest, the same way it's nice to have all but one of my gen eds knocked out.  

Shit, I'm halfway through college... it feels like I only just got here, except somehow I know a whole ton of people that I didn't in high school.  I mean, I've learned a great deal both intellectually and in terms of experience, I've changed and matured a lot... but more and more it feels like I've always been this way, even though that is thankfully not a misconception I have when actually calling up memories of the past.  I understand a lot of my decisions I made way back when that were more on gut instinct, now... I like the hindsight.  I fully realize how very dysfunctional middle and high school actually was in terms of the things that happened with my friends and I... and I still don't regret it.  

I don't think I would be strong enough to handle my health problems if I hadn't been made to run that emotional roller coaster day in day out until I finally learned to back off and desensitize when enough was enough.  This weakness in my body, the blow to my pride in terms of what I'm not physically capable of...  I think it would have been too much if I had been so naive as most people my age.  The whole bit of people being all wide-eyed and trying to soothe me for going through a ton of crap has absolutely no appeal, it really tends to turn me towards depression... but I think I follow, at least on an intellectual level, why it IS such a big deal to them.  I mean, there's always been something severely wrong with my life: my mother's health, my friends' situations that I dove headfirst into, my brother's bullshit, my whacko scheduling/loads of homework, my health.  I suppose, in a way, all of it has been training for this.  It's not exactly the easiest path to follow.  I mean, it's easier than many, but far from carefree.  I'm a firm believer that it is our experiences that make us the people we are, and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger; often, when something snaps you in half and you're barely able to limp along afterward... you're still stronger in the long run.  

Anyhow, I should be getting an A in Adolescent, and a B in Evolution so long as I don't bomb the final, so that makes the best case scenario two A's two B's and an F, which puts me at a semester GPA of 1.1, which is obviously very shitty, but I think my cumulative GPA up until this semester is a 3.2, and I have 91 credits...  I think the scholarship is based off of cumulative GPA.  Elsewise, I can see about the probation bit, use my health as an excuse and plead for a chance to do better or something... or if all else fails, I might be able to find a loophole in having had the scholarship that denies me residence and get state residence before fall and be at about the same tuition anyhow.  Or out of state tuition for a little while won't kill me, I go to a cheap school.  I'm going to be looking into other scholarships I qualify for over the summer so they'll help, and if I'm publishing... Munna said she won't let me use book money, if I ever get any, on tuition, but if I'm proving my successes elsewise then my parents probably won't grumble a whole ton about it.  I've already made the point to my mom that since Mari and I are both going into medicine and we'll be in our thirties when my sister graduates high school, I'm totally up for paying for her college education in the future so my father can focus on his retirement fund more... and yeah.

Mm, schoolwise, this summer, it's volunteer and shadowing so forth through May along with my reader job with the Disability office (I have a book on parenting I get to read out!  I constantly evaluate different methods in my free time for the hell of it, let alone the story application, so I'm really excited...), Trigonometry through June, and the start of July, and Principles of Chemistry II lab and lecture July and August.  Da's going to run me through the gambit again on reviewing Principles of Chemistry I during May and June so that I really have it down in stone.  Also going to be focusing on the publishing so forth, rereading Harry Potter before the last book comes out... and who knows what else.  I'm really looking forward to this summer.... and it all starts once I finish my final today.  I'm probably going to crash immediately afterwards because I haven't slept much.... but yeah.  I might get some stuff done before I do just because I was sleeping yesterday late morning/afternoon, but yeah.  I've got a ton of crap to get done before I can head home for May...  I suspect i'll be up late/early again packing and cleaning.  

I'm trying out the mood thingie...  There's a whole LOT of them.  Kye, when you make mood themes do you do pics for them ALL?  o.O"

"event","Just for the record... nausea sucks.  

It's been getting worse... not that the painkillers aren't merrily feeding it fuel, but it's hard to make a choice between wanting to scream and crawl into bed for the rest of your life due to pain, or if you feel like curling in a fetal position and trying to shovel yogurt and bread without sitting up because if you uncurl, you WILL puke.  Either way, they seem to be either constant or a minimum of thrice daily (that's really a good day) of both symptoms.  Today, I didn't take any painkillers and I was really nauseated...  *considers* ...ten times.  Oh, fun, let's make that eleven, say the devil's name and he appears...  Though I wasn't nauseated as often yesterday, when I had to take two Lortabs to get through the day, though those bouts were much more severe... though I'm proud to say I stayed on my feet and walking for the first two major bouts, which each lasted almost two hours...  I had to hit the floor and curl to try to handle the last, then bolt for the bathroom when I realized the yogurt my mom got me wasn't so hot of an idea while it was still peaking...  Cold towel, ice pack, and about twenty minutes later and I was perfectly fine.  My mom's a sweetheart, she kept getting shit for me, then I actually got her to curl into bed with me until the dogs started trying to join us at around five.  

I'm getting better at forcing through it, of measuring how strong it has to be when it's time to run for a toilet NOW, and how long it can be ignored.  I'm trying really hard to have it not destroy my life, but it's kinda hard to walk and grin like normal when it's getting bad enough that I'm dizzy as fuck.  Is it normal for nausea to make everything seem surreal?  It's getting bad enough that I'm starting to feel like when I had the fentanyl patch slapped on when I'm not on anything... and pain is still an issue often enough that maybe I should reconsider the patches.  I ditched them because after feeling like I was trying to wade through really old jelly instead of plain air for a couple hours, I started throwing up or dry heaving every ten minutes until I took the thing off.  Maybe my tolerance for the nausea wasn't too good then...  I've had a lot more experience now.  If I'm going to be that bad anyhow, I might as well have the pain relief benefits.  And God, it would be so nice to have a patch I change every couple days instead of... shit, I really don't want to count how many pills I have to take every morning.  

The Dr. put me on Avara instead of methotrexate because she thought the latter was causing the nausea...  I think the worsening of nausea means she was wrong.  Methotrexate attacks the purine side of the DNA chain (the A and G bases, for those of you who only took basic biology in high school) in cells that are reproducing quickly, Avara attacks the pyrimidines (T and C) in the same fashion, and for unknown reasons when one version attack causes nausea, the other generally doesn't.  Considering how much worse the nausea got after the switch, I think the methotrexate wasn't what was causing the nausea (although it's incredibly uncommon for methotrexate to NOT cause nausea, but I was on it for something like ten months before the nausea started), the Avara's making me worse... which means I'm probably going back to injecting myself with a cc of methotrexate once a week.  That kinda sucks too, but it's nothing like the Humira was, the shot doesn't actively hurt to do; I just need to make Mari and Kye chase me around to make sure I actually take it when I'm supposed to.  

On the other hand, if methotrexate isn't the culprit... then what is?  It's not the nadolol, I weaned off then quit it for a few weeks and it made no difference.  I would laugh my ASS off if it was the Prevacid, which is supposed to make me produce less acid overall and decrease my reflux.  The folic acid is something that's naturally in the body, and I'm only taking a large supplement of it because it makes the likelihood of things like severe nausea and my hair falling out (since methorexate, Avara, and Remicade are chemotherapy agents) far less likely.  Removing the folic acid from the medley would probably increase the nausea and make me look ashen as fuck all the time.  The Flexoril is in such an extremely small dose that the doctors are boggled that it has such a dramatic effect on eradicating my ""twitch,"" so that seems unlikely, and also, if I quit taking it, the twitch will come back and with it the full glory of my fibromyalgia.  I'll take puking my guts out on a weekly, hell, DAILY basis before I'll welcome that monster back into my body.  I doubt it's the Claratin I started taking a week ago, because I've taken it during allergy season for year with only minor headaches as a side effect.  That leaves birth control, which I also severely doubt because I've been on it for almost three years with no issues, along with Avara, which I already mentioned I suspected, and Zofran... which is the anti-nausea med that makes daily life a possibility.  

The nausea started long before Avara, however.  Those are my daily meds, but I also have an IV infusion of Remicade every four weeks; it's a TNF-blocker that stops my body from being able to form as many of the inflammation cells that are destroying my joints.  The Remicade is my real savior... it makes pain nonexistant for the first two weeks after treatment, and then it only comes back to levels that I have trouble handling in the fourth week.  I only take the narcotic painkillers when I'm in the fourth week, and only sometimes, because I can generally only hold my cookies down for about an hour after I take them.  The nausea also started before the Remicade... but before that I was on a different TNF-blocker called Humira, that I injected every two weeks... and for the record, the Humira did jack shit and hurt like hell to inject.  And, of course, the nausea started after I started it... though it was NOTHING like it is now.  

So, if it's the TNF-blocker that starts the nausea... tough shit, I can't quit.  I don't want to.  If that's what it is, I have to just live with it, the stuff is what makes me human again.  You never realize how valuable living a painfree life is until you're in hell and somebody's dangling a cup of water just out of your reach.  You just WANT it so bad, even if you're strong enough to handle life as it is.  I want to scream because I used to handle so much more than this so much better... but it's just been so LONG I've has this constant crap going on... and I got a real slap in the face for learning to ignore pain.  If I learned to ignore it all again, I suspect the fibromyalgia will come back again... and the fibro will get worse until it can't be screened out.  I'm fairly familiar with the process, and I'll take gasping over a toilet bowl every day before waking up in the morning because my entire body is screaming and I can't do anything except start sobbing.  

Just... shit, I don't know.  I see the rheumatologist tomorrow... maybe she'll make it all make sense again.  she's good at that.  I need to tell her some of the other shit that's been starting with my body in terms of major cramps and unpleasant things in that region of the body that I should have told her about MONTHS ago, because they've been getting worse... but damnit, that means more meds.  I've been TRYING playing with my diet to fix it, but it's not helping at all...  with my luck, I've gone and developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome too, just watch.  I got the fuckin' weird health LOTTERY, I tell you.  

I'm just ranting...  I can hardly wait for this next week to be over, for school to be out for a couple weeks.  I appear to have a book ready for an editor to look at, which is very happy...  Maybe I'll be published before this time next year.  That'd be a dream come true... and I'll look kickass for med school too.  I'm doing volunteer stuff this coming week too, on top of the note taking I did this semester, and a lot of volunteering in hospitals and shadowing this May... My math grades might suck, but I'll look kickass elsewise.  Locksmith (if unpracticed), published author, job at the school's disability center, thousands of shadowing and volunteering hours, graduating with close to 200 credits, along with good grades in seemingly everything except math... I should be alright.  *sighs* I just need to figure myself out healthwise... again...  

I'll feel better by tomorrow, honest."

"event","Life is like some sort of strange dance, it seems....  when you're doing good, you're executing each step perfectly, when you're in the shitcan you're listening to the music and trying to will yourself to get back up so you can go again.... and the rest of the time you're somewhere between shuffling along and doing the steps okayish.  Lately, I'm shuffling a lot more than I ought to be, than I need to be.... and I'm not proud of it, but I can't seem to stop.  

*flexes hands* I've started avoiding the pain instead of striding through it....  I used to be able to ignore it, you know?  It's not bad pain, I know I CAN ignore it.... if I can make myself care enough about what I ought to be doing to take that deep breath and start moving in the measured steps I know by heart.  I'm not scared of the destination, what comes will come... be it happiness as the disease ceases to progress, or higher doses of medication that will slaughter my immune system, or the looming lymphoma swooping down...  cancer's not that scary when you know it's coming, right?  If you watch for it, you can start treatment as early as possible, and then there's no real risk of death, despite it being a form of blood cancer... and shit, methotrexate and remicaide are chemotherapy drugs anyhow, so starting more hardcore chemo wouldn't be too much of an issue, right?  I'm used to the fevers out of nowhere that last for a few hours before fading away again, to the nausea...  I've been through enough pain that whatever might be to come should be anticlimactic, at this point.  

Right?

I'm a coward these days... the pain's not bad, but I'm letting it rule me.  I used to be better than this.  What happened to the girl that said no fluke of the nervous system or disease was going to rule her life, it could all be damned, nothing was going to keep me from what I wanted.  And it's not, really.... the issue is do you really WANT to go to class?  It's snowing right now, and the arthritis is burning its way through my joints... the pain won't be so bad if I just lie stilll.... if I find something to distract.... but the issue is, it's NOT bad enough for me to baby myself like this.  I know better... but damn, I'm just so tired of the day in day out sometimes.  The dance seems less and less important than something of a passable shuffle.... and I've done better than this while in far worse condition.  

I need to truly care about something that I need to get done, but I do care about my school and all, I just... keep hiding behind this wall of cowardice I've built up.  I don't want to move more than I have to unless I'm enjoying it, because the price is more pain.... the more I enjoy myself, the more pain I'll reap once I slow down to catch my breath.  I think that the joy is always worth it, but at the same time, it's so tempting to just sit in stagnation some days, let it all stay fairly even and melancholy...

*shakes head* I'm better than this, I really am...  I just have to remember the tune I used to jig to, that somehow allowed both full performance and breaks to rest in, only a version of it that doesn't include slaving my body right into the ground.  *bites lip* Maybe it's not possible...  but I have to still try, right?"

"event","*taps at desk* I can't win.  

The nausea won't go away, no matter how I fiddle with my meds or diet; it's just resulting in me eating more like a meal and a half a day, though I try to make it nutritious wen I do eat, because fuck if I want the fibromyalgia back in its full glory.  The only reason I think it's not wreaking full havoc yet is because my solution to the nausea most of the time is to try to nap it off.  

Waking up on the bathroom floor, however, just doesn't appeal.  

I can't seem to balance between dealing with the pain or dealing with the pain meds, because avoiding puking seems to be absolutely impossible once they hit.  That and I can't think very well while high, for all that my psychology professor was quite impressed with my debate skills the day I went to her class high as a kite.  It can't be the remicade, because the nausea was in full swing for two or three weeks before I started it... and I don't have a fever, so I don't think I caught the stomach flu...

I'm so tired of being sick...  So tired of the aches I've learned to ignore but that never really seem to go away...  So tired of being drugged out of my mind...  So tired of being tired and depressed day in day out.  There's happy moments, but they seems so short.... and burning my hand on some soup and having a few minutes of euphoria where my senses are absolutely sharp and all the other pain vanishes shouldn't count, but it does.  I'm not going to follow that one because it'll lead down a path I KNOW I don't want to go down...  But damnit, I miss feeling good so bad it hurts emotionally, and the depression will only make it all cycle more viciously, i know that, but it's getting harder and harder to avoid. 
 
I just... I really fucking miss truly being carefree about my body.  I want to tussle with my friends again, I want to learn parkour, I want to start gymnastics training or just fill my old backpack and get lost in the woods for a week or two.  I want to eat only when I get hungry instead of when I know I ought to, I want to be able to get shit sleep and keep doing whatever needs doing and not get hit with it too hard...  I don't want the body of an old woman at eighteen.  Fuck it, I've been like this since I was seventeen!

Everything happens to me young, and in a lot of ways it's been really good, but I'll have this for the rest of my life, and it's my own fucking pride that made it happen now instead of maybe even just three or five years but hell, maybe ten years later!  What I would give to only be getting this when I was at least heading to med school...  

Fuck, but I'm seriously in for a long haul..."

"event","When I was a little girl, my parents always made sure i realized the unfortunate people in the world existed despite my privileged life.  Victims of poverty, those from abusive relationships and/or families, the unfortunate in cases of accident...  My parents were both in medicine, they understood the value of knowledge, and they showede me everything they could both good and bad so that I would have an understanding of the world.  They also instilled a deep desire to help whoever I could, whatever the situation.  

In middle school, that last got me in trouble near constantly... but I suppose that's not the point.  I always thought I was the lucky one, I was the one without problems, so I needed to be strong, stable point that anyone around me could hang onto.  By the end of middle school, I realized that a) no one wants help, b) trying to keep steady was fucking me up inside and really just making me walk on eggshells with everyone I knew, and c) it was okay to live for me too.  I wanted to help people, more than anything... but it was okay to step back and have a selfish moment too, before you burst from the pressure and shit hits the fan even harder than it did because you quit sidestepping those eggshels and started sprinting.  

Before 8th rgade really ended, I had realized that I had some physical problems.  By the time 9th was in full swing, I realized that they were really going to affect my life.  By the beginning 10th grade, I had begun to realize the meaning of true pain, and what people mean when they say pain can be disabling.  I learned to fear the sensations that told me a severe twitch fit was coming, learned to book my ass out of reality and into sleep as fast as I could when I felt my muscles start to tense even though they were already so exhausted from seizing up that i wanted to cry.  By March of 2004, pain was my entire world; the trick was to distract myself enough by doing this or that, so that i could forget for a little while.  Heh, and they thought I kept talking when I was supposed to keep my mouth shut during theater practice just because I was bored...  Everything the fan near the end of March and I finally gave in about seeing a doctor when what seemed like everything else in the world came crashing down at the same time...  I forgot my own sixteenth birthday.

After that it was series of side-effect jammed medication after medication until I finally decided to try what I'd heard about in stories, and the docs all said was impossible.  Even though it hurt like hell to do it, I learned to control that involuntary muscle movement though sheer will mixed with a fortm of self-hypnosis and relaxation techniques...  I mastered my demon.  I learned how to play with the idea of pain in my head until i could convince myself i didn't hurt, even when on some level i still wanted to scream.  If you refuse to let the pain touch you, it won't...  You just have to want it bad enough.  

Nothing could hurt me ever again.  At the same time all this was happening, I'd had an almost entirely parallel story of emotional pain, and was better for it...   I had conquered my hell, and I thought I could never be taken down again.  

I graduated a year early, and the summer leading up to my first year of college, I started getting some minor pain in my joints periodically.  I can't tell you what minor pain is anymore, but...  I think it was minor, and it didn't happen too often.  I knew rheumatoid arthritis ran in my mother's family, that most of the relatives on that side showed minor symptoms, so I didn't think much of it.... until I moved to college and it started to get worse.  I put it down as the weather; there's a good difference between Las Vegas and in the mountains in Utah.  

But then it kept getting worse.  I started taking the vitamins and supplements to help with that kind of thing...  No help.  And the pain was spreading beyond my joints.  I learned to just cope with it, it was only pain after all...  but then I screwed up my shoulders in yoga because apparently my shoulder joints are built a little oddly.  After that, it started getting worse faster, and I started to get scared.  The pain had no meaning, like the twitch muscular pain did; I knew what was happening, there.  Just, suddenly it would feel as though acid was searing down my bones, through my veins...  The slightest movement and all my joints in that limb would start popping, I limped around like an old woman, and the pain that wasn't in my joints was a million times worse, just excruciating, searing fire through every inch of my being...  I would wake up some mornings and just start sobbing.  I had mastered the pain from my twitch, learned to treat the kind of pain that would make most howl...  and now it seemed as though that awful pain was the same as when a silly child falls down and skins her knees and crying her heart out.  I was no stranger to pain, but I couldn't even begin to conquer this.  

Many tests and a rheumatologist appointment later, it was decided that I both had rheumatoid arthritis and a nasty case of fibromyalgia, the cause of which, apparently, was my brutal control over my own body.  I stressed my muscles too hard in order to manage my spasms, never let them rest enough, so they had started to steal nutrients from the rest of my body.  Bitterfuckinsweet, ne?  I do the impossible, and all I get is hell to pay.  Time to go back to the neurologist I had more or less told to go fuck himself almost a year previously, and beg for help, which came in the form of an anti-seziure med that made me twitch more than I ever had, then a test run with some muscle relaxers... which turned out to be almost as good as an on/off switch.  Then time to get nutrients back into the body I'd driven like a slave into desolation, and the pain started to ebb away in most of my body, but the arthritis became worse, and seems to be getting worse...

Seventeen is a shitty age to be diagnosed with a rheumatic disease...  though there's always worse, naturally.  The medications now are more serious, but not too hard to cope with, at least not yet.  They're destroying my immune system, bit by bit though, and... that's terrifying, really.  I'm eighteen now (finally legally responsible for my own person, woot), and it eats me away how much it hurts to use my hands most days, not even to mention any of my other assaulted joints.  I can't give blood anymore; methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug, it disrupts healing, and they don't want that.  Humira... well, the instructions include a label that says ""DO NOT PUT HANDS INTO NOSE OR MOUTH PRIOR TO IMMEDIATE WASHING"", so that should give you a general idea.  Some talk of being very wary of respiratory infections and how it raises your chances of getting cancer, specifically leukemia.  Then my father slaps an oximeter on me for fun and finally realizes what I've been telling him for a year, that my average heartrate when relaxing is 110-125, and now I'm on meds for that too...

It's terrifying when the pain gets to the point that you realize you would do almost anything just to make it stop.  I've been there before, the kind of blinding pain where everything is white and blurry and all you can do is flail and dimly realize that this awful noise is hurting your ears and your throat is raw but that sound won't stop...  Alternately, I've been down the avenue where you haven't stopped hurting like hell in weeks and weeks, and you're so depressed all you ever want to do is cry, because there's just no point in getting up, and your only escape is something that can steal your attention entirely, be it the company of a friend or a book or game, excitement over even the stupidest things or sex...  You just need to run away or you'll go insane and/or cry yourself back to sleep only to wake up in more pain...

*sighs* I just went to a cadaver exhibit downtown and caught myself thinking about how I'd consider giving my body to science if it weren't for the fact that my organs can be used to save someone... when it occured to me that no, actually, no one would want my organs anymore than they'd want my blood.  My best friend said something the other day that first amazed and confused me, then made me want to start crying as I thought to say that no, I wanted to do it myself... before realizing that if I'm in this much pain ON medications, what would happen if I tried to go that long without them, what a horror it would really be...  And that hurt, to realize that.  I want to be a paramedic, maybe even a doctor...  I want to save people...  but it seems like it's me who really needs to be saved.  There's so much I'm realzing I really can't do, that I'm not allowed to do anymore...  I finally got out of the house and have all the freedom of the world, legal or not...  and I couldn't take most of them up even if I wanted to.  

Shit, I'm depressed, I was hoping this might help...  It's just ironic, I always thought I was the lucky one.   Someone my age shouldn't know this much about pain...  Hell, no one should have to deal with this kind of shit, but life's never fair.  I've got so much else that's so good, maybe this is just the balance demanded of me...  it'll probably make me into a stronger person.  I remember being this depressed about the twitch, then later deciding I wouldn't want it any other way because I wouldn't be the woman I am today without that experience.  I just need to learn to cope again, I know that, and then I'll be fine.  Everything works itself out in the end, one way or another, and I'll continue on and think of my trials with this the same way I do about my past problems...  But shit, I just wish I could finish and look back already, and I guess I'm scared that it'll never truly end.  It won't ever end, not this...  but my lack of ability to cope will come to an end eventually, and I WILL be stronger for it.  That's who I am, and I'm not going to break myself over some fucking disease."

Today:
it was acutally really good, math was fun becuase all katie and i did was talk so i mean like that was good.

"event","hey! well i couldnt update yesterday because my parents were going psycho  on me but whatever. I mean i love my parents they're awesome i actually do have a pretty good relationship with them but sometimes i just want to like smack them! but i'm lucky with what i have i guess that part of growing up getting yelled at your parents for no apparent reason. I don't like it but oOo well i have to deal with it.

Well today was madd hectic omg! Well we had a sub for English and world themes so we like did nothing, and nothing special happened. Third i had a bio learning center with emily so we like were gonna go to Clark but decided not to and so we got a pass from miss rubin and we went to get soemthing to eat, but emily decided not too haha but i got my big hot chocolate =) haha my third one this week woot woot! Then i actually studied for bio and stuff since im gonna like fail. Then spanish was boring like usual. Onstage was pretty good sarah jessica and I praticed our piece but we didn't know it was lunch for like five minutes haha then today got hectic. Lunch was alright, i just ate with melanie and we walked around, and we witnessed a screaming fight! omg like my first fight it wasnt so bad i guess, jusy loud screaming this girl was upset that this other girl was talking about her, or osmething silly like that. Then we had the bio test it wasnt that hard so hopefully i did well.Well when i finished i went to clark to go to my locker and changed into my capris, well long story short i wanted to wear a skirt my mom wouldnt let me out of the house, and i was bad and brought the skirt to school but i wanted to wear that skirt! So i'm walking down and as soon as im in the student center i hear someone scream oOo shit! And so i walked and stopped and I looked and people were running like the security guards and other janitors and Jenna was walking past and we were like omg what happened and we saw a guy on the floor whpo was a janitor and we thought he fell down well then Jenna asked me to go to the student activites but it was closed and one of the security was just coming out and let us drop the hting she had to drop off. Then we realized this guy had a heart attack or something becuase they called the ems and was like there is an emergency get over here and we saw a guy holing up his head and saying come on breathe dont give up on us! It was so scary and we were like all scared becuase we just witnessed a janitor having a heart attack  or something i mean thats real scary. So we walked back to bio and told Mr V and we told him and everyone was like omg and so i was like all scared i had that like you know scary shakey feeling in your stomach oh i hate that, but we got let out early like five minuets and we saw the guy get pulled into the ems but he was sitting so i guess he was doing much better then we saw him. But so the bus was good, then i went home and took a nap until um 9:30 oops! But i dont feel so hott so yea that was my day

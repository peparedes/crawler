In my real home in Moldova a different animal pisses on my home; the beast of oppression. Just as I hiss at the cat to chase it away, so my music must hiss at the oppressors to speed them away. </p><p>Harmony must be a cacophony enough to make bleed the ears of the oppressors.</p><p>Deaf to the oppressors.</p>"

"event","I was locked up for eight long years, now I am free I lock myself up in my container.
I am comforted by the sound of the key in the padlock, it sings to me in my sleep and calls me each morning.
I do not know where the last two weeks have gone, they just slipped away while I was not looking. Maybe someone stole the days from my calendar, but it is hard to say since someone stole my calendar because I forgot to lock up."

"event","I am mongrel.

I was born Moldovan and Moldovan I will die, but many think me foreigner.

My mother was Romanian. Her father was Romanian, her mother was Russian. It pains me to say this but it is true. Her mother's mother was Georgian.

My father was Moldovan and his mother was Moldovan.&nbsp;My father's father was a Serb. It is said My father's father's mother was a granddaughter of a Turkish sultan, but nobody knows where this story came from. It is probably the lies of a dog.

The mongrel dog bites as hard as a pedigree, and harder than a toothless old man."

I have rotten feet from my wet Moldovan army boots and my papers are all fallen apart. I found no new members for Vodinkja and no good wines. Have been to a shop and bought a bottle of Chilean wine from Chile. It is too fruity for me, I like it&nbsp;sharp as vinegar. Hereford is very strange place do you not think?"

I am going to Hereford, Manchester, Liverpool, Peterborough and Deal to search for newe great people. I will be busy and staying with friends of friend Michael all this time. I will not be getting to a computer to bring forth my message. Hopefully, out of these five cities I will bring forth new harmony and uplifting of spirits. I am hoping to find new wine to drink also.

"event","The Leipzig photograph reminded me of Irina Mariescu. She was a prostitute in Kishinev who I dated for three months when I was just 18. She was 42 and very experienced. I learned a lot from her. Sex, card games, tin whistle, hula hooping and more else. Alas she died when she was 51 years old. They said she had a bad chest, but I thought her chest was quite good for her age.

I am sorry. It is bad joke and in poor spirit. I raise my class of cider to her memory. Szulte Irina. What is cider? It tastes like apples which have been kept in a bag behind the oil radiator of an old womans&nbsp;tenement building apartment. If that is hopw it is made then I shall not&nbsp;drink it any more.&nbsp;

Friend Michael says this is how it is made in a place called Falmouth."

Soldiers for a war on oppression. Only when people see that they are not free to choose shall they rise up and snatch freedom from the oppressors' grip. the people shall see the oppressors' treachery. See that they give with one hand, but wield the small knife&nbsp;with the other. We shall turn that knife with our song; strong voices will bring down their watchtower, our art shall be our banner, our freedom to resist will be unbound. We will never subjugate ourselves infront of their feet as a dog laps at the feet of the hunters horse.&nbsp;<br /><br />This wine of Michael's is very good.</p>"

"event","Red wine is a treacherous friend. He was very good for me last night, but in the night he hit me over the head with&nbsp;hammer and now he is gone and I am left with a head that is sore. If you see him, tell him I am as mad as a bull with ants up his nose and I will smash his pretty green bottle and cast his cork to the waves to be consumed by fishes. 

I am just now recovering from his deed. Moldovan government wine did not do this to me, but then it was impossible to drink three bottles of the stuff, one would render an ox incompetent because of the chemicals they put in it to keep people from singing political songs too loud. They do not wish to have freedom through harmony as&nbsp;we do my brothers. 

Freedom through harmony. Freedom through art. Freedom through a fine Merlot."

Unplug from mains electricity before connecting back up. I am hurting from the finger now as I just have elactric shock treatment from a kettle whilst connecting it to a Rocktek distortion pedal. I want to boil water on stage and amp it up the sound like a crescendo to atomic explosion. And then make a cup of tea for Limni who likes it black with two sugar lumps.

Ah. On stage. After eight years it will feel good to be on stage again. I must do it alone or find some new boys as my team are all back in Moldova, either behing bars in prison or in bars drinking dogs piss beer. I am drinking red wine and it is good."

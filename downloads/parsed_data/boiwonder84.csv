""Whooo-hoo!!! We won!!!!
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

It just goes to show how incredibly dumb the Bush voters are. They are not treating this like an election, with many lives at stake with a full blown war being fought by our kids in Iraq; cataclysmic errors in national security causing our civil liberties to be severely crippled; too great a divide between the haves and the have-nots culminating in the worst economic situation in nearly eight decades; the threat to women's rights by insane religious fanatics seeking to ban abortion and therefore do away with equality; the aberration of freedom that is the Federal Marriage Amendment and the dehumanization of gay and lesbian Americans, etc, etc, etc. They are acting like it is some kind of sporting event, like their team won, and they are going to celebrate by doing beer bongs and hanging each other outside hotel windows by their big, stupid, un- evolved webbed feet. They see America like a giant tailgate party, and they are getting ready for the big game with Al-Qaeda.

Unfortunately, this is not an action film, and therefore, having the Terminator on your side is no advantage. Might does not equal right, just as we must awaken to the hard, cold realization that majority should not rule. The majority is responsible for slavery, denying women and minorities the vote, Japanese internment, segregation, lynching and a million other injustices and inhumanities. Fortunately, this majority is one by a very small margin. I encourage everyone who is distressed by the outcome of the election to remember that just because Bush is still in office does not mean that his power will be increased. He is going to have a harder time doing anything, because he knows that everyone is watching and waiting for him to make a mistake, of which there will be countless many. 

Bush knows that people are terribly disappointed by his win, and that is really hilarious. It is an empty victory, because now he's got to attempt to steer the nation out of the muddy ditch he drove us into, and he will just be spinning his wheels while we stand by and laugh our Democrat asses off. Seriously, Bush is so fucked I hope he is popping lots of amyl nitrate and practicing Lamaze breathing. If we just don't allow ourselves to sit back and let the only-just-barely-majority rule, then we have the advantage. Everything they try to do can be shot down like a shotput, because we are watching. We are everywhere and we know that now. It is an exciting time, and I have to say I am thrilled at the possibilities, because now what is in front of us is the big show where the Bush administration goes down on themselves and their constituency Bangkok style. 

I love getting hate mail, because it makes me see exactly the mentality of the idiots I am dealing with. It is no challenge to outsmart them. It is just hard to comprehend how stupid they actually are. All I can say is keep those letters coming. I am not glad that Bush won, but I am glad to watch all those Neanderathals fall flat on their sloping, heavy-browed skulls. You know I am going to Tivo this. Those ""Christians"" that prayed for Bush to win are going to be praying a lot more in the coming four years because they are going to realize that losing this election will not deter anyone from fighting for what is theirs. The future is up for grabs, because the Bush administration and the people who love them haven't a clue what to do next. They think it is some big doofus cowboy homecoming game and The 700 Club are thrusting pompoms in the air on the sidelines. They don't know that this is about life or death. If they did, then they wouldn't have voted for Bush. But since they did, they are all going down. 

Whatever warrior rituals you might have, I suggest that you do them. Whether it is carbo loading or drinking down a dozen raw eggs, putting on warpaint or applying your reddest lipstick, drawing pictures of Republicans on the walls of your cave and stabbing them with your spear, dressing yourself up in animal skins and taking lots of hallucinogens, listening to AC/DC or Public Enemy or Heart cranked up so loud it distorts, come on! ""BARRACUDA!!!!!!"" Do whatever it takes to get your war on (that's a good one. read David Rees!) We need soldiers to fight the war at home. We gotta represent our hood, where justice, peace, equality and freedom live. We have a date to rumble with stupidity, ignorance, prejudice, laziness, hatred and greed. Victory is sweet, but revenge is sweeter, and we will know both sooner than we think. 

In those fateful words that fake American hero George W. Bush stole from real American hero Todd Beamer to justify the abominable Iraq war, ""Let's roll!"""

"event","To say my weekend was productive and one of the best I've had in a long time would be an understatement. Costumes, drinking, Margaret and boys. Can't get much better.

Friday night was spent seeing Margaret Cho in Jax at the Florida Theatre in the third row, with my girls/roommates when I'm homeless Karel and Lauren. During her opening, I yelled, ""I love you Margaret!!!"" And she looked at me, pointed and said, ""I love you too!"" I just about died. Like literally. And get this, this concert was taped for her next CD so I'm totally on it. Snaps for being ballsy and loud. Anyways, the show was amazing...it wasn't her traditional situational comedy that she's known for but more of her political agenda and about the current state of affairs in the US... ""You know Laura Bush's pussy tastes like Lysol!"" ""Whenever a fudamentalist/bible thumper gets in my face, I'm all like, 'Don't you have something else to do...like get ready for the rapture?'"" It was an insane show. So hot. Absofuckinlutely insane.

After the show, I hooked up with Jen and Randi at the Jax Landing for the Florida/Georgia game preparty. Landing was crowded like whoa...worse than Bourbon during Mardi Gras. It was hot. We met up with the imfamous Matt Clarke, who I briefly ""dated"" last fall not knowing he had a boyfriend already. Long story short, the boyfriend is Hunter Sleiman of Sleiman Enterprises, who owns the Landing and most of Jax evidently. Hunter understandibly hates me and we've never had a conversation that didn't end in him lunging at me or calling sercurity. Anyways, Matt was pretty happy to see me and we ended up taking shots of Grey Goose in the backseat of his boyfriend's Yukon. Just call me Holly Homewrecker.

So we end up upstairs going the the VIP section, never questioning that Hunter will be in VIP section and he probably wouldn't be very happy to see his boyfriend with the guy he was schelping last year. On the way there we stop to let Randi and Jenn use the bathroom and Matt ends up getting in a fight with a girl in line, pushing her, throwing his beer on her and getting arrested. Hunter of course manipulated the police with power and got him out the next day.

Randi gets lost. Jen and I party it up with some business owners and doctors on several yachts in the marina and start to worry about Randi, I think. I think we were worried, not sure. Anyways we leave about 430ish and get lost of the way back to the car.

I work Saturday morning about 8. Not so much fun.

Saturday was a a whirlwind of parties and falling over in my 6 inch stilleto heels. Very fun. I looked absofuckinlutely hot hot hot. Straight guys kept hitting on me and I ended up hooking up with a guy named Donny and his friend John from UCF and they stayed the night in bed. John is hot hot hot.

Went to Denny's with John, Rachel, Jeff, Sparkle, Kayla and Adam and yelled at that skanky Jersey cunt that walked by our table so that everyone could hear me and recognize what a bucktooth bitch she is. 

Karma's a bitch and her name is Eric."

"event","As I was checking my email Tuesday afternoon, I noticed an email from Meredith Brace-Sloss, a girl that I meet online before coming to Flagler and then hung out with the first few weeks of freshman year. Then something went terribly wrong, and to be completly honest, I don't remember what exactly it was, but it did include roommate fights, my moving out of my original room, the entire drama department hating me and rabid rumors circulating on both fronts.

It was messy. It was unneccessary. It was mean and immature.

I didn't talk to Paul for the rest of the year and it was a shame. About a week into this semester I saw that Paul was online and I AIMed him to let him know that I was sorry for all that was said and done, whatever it was, and that, although we didn't neccessarily have to be friends, I wouldn't turn away if I saw him.

I think karma has a funny way of coming back to you because that email from Meredith was very similar. I was very impressed with the way we all have handled the situation and was inspired by Meredith's candor and courage to speak to me....Later that day, thinking of what Meredith had written, I approaced a girl that I had had unneccessary beef with last semester and made ammends there too.

Thank you to Meredith for allowing me to better myself.

I think if we were to all do something similar, to better ourselves, that, somehow, the world would become a bigger and better place."

"event","I was at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport returning home on Sunday, trying to get to my connection on time. In the line near the food court, there was an older black woman, caught in the rope forming the line, her bags falling in disarray all around her. People flew past her, stepped over her, were clearly annoyed and made angry remarks, like ""How dare she have a lot of stuff! How dare she block the entrance with all her fucking...stuff!"" 

I had already missed my flight in Scottsdale and was on the way to miss my connector to Memphis, but I stopped, and helped her put the bags back on her rolling rack. They were tangled up in elastic because she had tried to put everything back together so fast because people were giving her all kinds of shit because she was in the way. I pulled the bags out and put them back in. Another woman saw us, and picked up a bottle of water that had rolled away from her rack. The lady looked up at me and said, ""Thank God there are still nice people left in the world."" She beamed, and stood up, in her silky blue jacket, and she waved at me as I ran to catch my plane.

She was wrong. I am not a nice person. I just hate it when people ignore others who are in need. That makes me considerate, maybe, but ask anyone who knows me, I am not nice. I am a fucking bitch. I have been known to shoplift. I complain all the time. I am unbearable and annoying. 

I have such bad physical problems from working so much that I have to rely on other people to take care of many of my most basic needs. I don't know how to use an ATM machine. I am possibly the most manipulative person you are likely to encounter. If you look in the dictionary under ""selfish"", you will see my name and a small artist's rendering of my face. 

The people in my world who love me the most live in a kind of hell from which they cannot escape, because even though I am who I am, what I am, how horrible I am, my love is overwhelming. This terrible incarceration they choose willingly, and their suffering is compensated many times over. 

I am ferociously mean and unbearably kind, and this paradox is what keeps my friends close and my enemies closer. I hate injustice, dishonesty, cowardice, greed, stupidity - but that doesn't stop me from committing all of these acts in one way or another. I am not nice. Not in the least. But that will not stop me from helping you."

"event","Jimmy Swaggart expressed a lot of anger and frustration on Canadian TV about the marriage equality issue. He thought the idea of men marrying other men was ludicrous and that he'd never met a man he wanted to marry. Also, he threatened to kill any man that gave him the eye, and that he would ""tell God that he died."" 

I believe in free speech, and Swaggart has a right to say what he likes, yet it is irresponsible and highly un-Christian to advocate murder and lying to God about it. His words just point to all kinds of crazy. He has a clear and defined history of insanity, with his well documented and odd relationship with a prostitute which caused him to leave his ministry and ask for forgiveness from his congregation. I think that his congregation did forgive him, out of embarrassment and hope that he would shut up if nothing else. I fear that they will not only forgive his last statements, they will echo them and take them as gospel. 

People think too simply nowadays. They only need soundbites to sustain them. This is why the anchors on FOX news always create and repeat catchphrases which brainwash and manipulate the masses. For a time, every time they mentioned Michael Moore, they always said, ""The man who believes not enough Americans were killed in Iraq."" As if this were his title, his job description. Not only is it untrue, it is actually completely the opposite, but unfortunately the audience that watches and believes Fox News doesn't feel the need to investigate or challenge what they are told. The ease in which the FOX message is heard and assimilated is the key to their success and may ultimately be the demise of democracy. Isn't that sad? That stupidity might be the thing that takes America down? 

Isn't it dumb to think that if you killed someone you could hide it from God? That is the scary thing about Swaggart's statement. It would not take a lot for him to consider ending another man's life, and he would be able to just tell God that the dude died. What happened to, ""Thou shalt not kill,"" or ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor?"" There is nothing in the Bible that says ""Thou shalt not cruise!"" 

Why does Swaggart get a free ride through sin city? Because God really hates gays too? When did that happen? There have been demands for Swaggart to recant his hateful statements and apologize to the gay community. If he does, it would be a miracle, and it would take more than a miracle to change the minds of those who believe that homosexuality is wrong. 

I have a terrible suspicion that you can't change people's minds, that even glaringly obvious logic wouldn't penetrate the hardened heart of one of these false Christians. They are too dumb to fight. They keep bringing God into it, stating and restating that the Bible tells us so, that we are going to hell. They've never even really read God's word in the first place. They just remember the slogans. Christianity has taken a wrong turn somewhere. 

There are major problems with the way that bigotry and prejudice is sanctioned by the church. It is at cross purposes with the nature of Christ, which is tolerance and compassion. Since when does the righteous God overrule the loving God? The only way to solve the problem of Christian chaos is to have a true separation of church and state. Only then can we begin to recover from this ecumenical nightmare and get back to the business of democracy."

I got backstage and was literally seven feet from her. I almost died. Absolutely fucking died.

Some mother on the squad called Christine to complain that Amy and I ruined her daughter's dance for the squad. Hell no, bitch. Your daughter's dance was dumb, looked elementary UCA and was not going to be out on our field, if Amy and I have anything to do with it. And we do so its not, thank you. Amy and I will have our girls the very best they can and we won't be stopped by protective mothers. Oh, no we won't.

"event","As I met Karel in front of the library for lunch on Saturday afternoon, we saw a Slip-n-Slide on the west lawn and nostalgia took me back to Saturday afternoons in the neighborhood with little friends and lemonade and riding bikes and going swimming in the pool. 

   That slip-n-slide looked like such innocent fun; running, hesitating for a moment and finally diving in all sorts of body-contorting positions onto the plastic smeared with dish soap and water, and laughing so hard if we made a fool of ourselves. Laughing at ourselves. What happended to that innocence?

   Seeing those crazy Christian Intervarsity kids lose themselves, if only for a few minutes, on that nostalgic slip-n-slide made me question a lot of things during yesterday... One year ago today, where was I? Six months ago? Am I stronger? More well rounded? Am I happy with the people I am around? Am I content in Saint Augustine? Is the west coast really for me? Am I really suppose to be in college now? Are my parents proud of me? What is my brother doing right now? Where am I going to be this time next year? In five years? How is my ten year class reunion going to be? Should I let my hair grow out longer? When am I going to see Greg again? Where will it be this time? Paris, Scottsdale? Hawaii? How am I going to spend my refund check? SHould I really move in with Jenn and Randi knowing damn well they love to party...a lot? Does anyone really know me? Am I really undateable? Unfuckable? Does that one person ever think about how much he hurt me? AM I ever going to be over that? Should I get the burgundy or the gold sheets? Am I going to make enought to pay rent this month? Do I really have that bad of credit?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ET has confirmed that Britney Spears and her dancer fiance Kevin Federline <CELEB>tied the knot in a surprise Saturday night ceremony in Studio City, CA. The bride wore a white strapless dress and Kevin donned a tuxedo as the two exchanged vows during a non-denominational ceremony. Twenty to thirty guests were on-hand for the event, which took place at a private home. <STRONG>Afterwards, everyone dined on a feast of chicken fingers and ribs while music played from a boombox.</STRONG></P>
<P>ET was there as the beaming bride left the house in the early hours of Sunday morning. A laughing Britney and her brand new husband departed the home in a black SUV. Marrying Federline makes Britney more than a new wife, she's also now step-mom to Federline's 2-year-old and newborn baby with ""Moesha"" actress Shar Jackson.</P>

"event","Effective 5:00pm today, my father will be forced into early retirement by the state of Florida and the Department of Corrections because he has refused to relocate for the fourth time in six years to clean up another mess someone else has made. David Crosby, secretary of the department, reassigned my dad to the 4th circuit in volusia, orange and someother county to reorganize the department ever since that scandal in that horrible scandal last month involving someone on probation in the Daytona area.
   
   This is ludacris. My father has committed 34 years of his life to selfless public service, working incredibly long hours, giving all of his soul and spirit to the public, putting his goals to the side in an attempt to better the state while raising three children moving to different cities, to different schools. My father deserves better than this.

   So this means that my father is moving again by May for another opportunity for my family...Athens, Scottsdale, Columbus, White Plains and Philadelphia have all been named as places he has leads. 

   I don't understand this. Everything was fine yesterday."

I don't know..

LA
By Beth Hart

She hangs around the boulevard 
She's a local girl with local scars 
She got home late 
She drank so hard the bottle ached 
& she tried 
but nothin's clear in a bar full a flies 
So she takes 
She understands when she gives it away 
She says 

Man I gotta get outta this town 
Man I gotta get outta this pain 
Man I gotta get outta this town 
Outta this town & out of L.A. 

She's gotta gun 
She got a gun she calls the lucky one 
She left a note right by the phone 
Don't leave a message 'cause this ain't no home 
& she cried 
She cried so long her tears ran dry 
Then she laughed 
'Cause she knew she was never comin' back 
She said 

Man I'm gonna get outta this town 
Man I'm gonna get outta this pain 
Man I'm gonna get outta this town 
Outta this town & out of L.A. 
It's all she loves It's all she hates It's all too much for her 
to take she can't be sure just where it ends or where 
the good life begins 
So she took a train 
to a little old town without a name 

She met a man he took her in 
but fed her all the same bullshit again 
'Cause he lied 
he lied like a salesman sellin' flies 
So she screamed 
it's a different place 
but the same old thang 
It's all I love It's all I hate It's all too much for me to take 
I can't be sure where it begins or if the good life lies within 
So she said 

Man I gotta get out of this town 
Yeah now I gotta get back on that train 
Man I gotta get out of this town 
I'm outta my pain 
So I'm goin' back to L.A."

"event","This is from Margaret Cho's blog...I'd thought it was poignant and well written, and thought I should share it...

Margaret and Bruce have begun their State of Emergency tour through many of the important swing states in the election. 

I was talking to a young activist named Todd in New Mexico who was working steadfastly on behalf of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which is quite a fierce moniker for a political organization. It conjures up images of SWAT teams and helicopters, riot gear and rubber bullets. He was telling me about getting to know voters in his area. 

New Mexico is an interesting state. It is fairly conservative, with a heavy military presence. It is also not very crowded, the vast expanses of desert take the place of cities and towns built up around Walmarts and Shoneys. There is also an amazing artistic community there, as well as a mega-rich elite class of divorcees, building second lives and second homes in Santa Fe, which makes it a strangely colorful and mysterious place. 

Basically, the NGLTF makes it their job of going door to door, and introducing themselves. ""Hi, my name is Todd. I am gay and I am an American. Let's talk about marriage equality."" This type of grass roots activism has helped them keep anti-gay legislation at bay. It is the simple act of humanizing the struggle, in the most poignant terms, putting a face to a name. When you put your handshake and smile on the brutal face of bigotry, the grimace has to go. There just isn't room in the heart for it. 

It seems like a scary idea, going in to someone's home that you don't even know, and telling them who you are and what you need from them. What you need from them isn't really much, though. It is just to pause before voting on something that would relegate you to second class citizenship. Marriage equality would do no harm to those vehemently opposed to it, besides the fact that it would exist. Yet, going to their house could be mildly upsetting. People might think you are insane, or worse, a Jehovah's Witness. Who wants to be associated with that Avon lady/Girl's Scout cookie religion? Yet the interaction is powerful. 

Most voters who vote against gay marriage are likely not to know what they are voting against, because they have no experience with gay culture, and are just going with the flow of prejudice. If they are not given a chance to change, the opportunity to face the exact person they would be negatively affecting by their vote, they will always choose the evil they know. 

It is very difficult to be mean to someone to their face. It isn't human nature. I can't accomplish this with any comfort at all. My spine gets tingly, my face starts to twitch. I get completely flushed and red with anxiety. If I have to be mean, I have to practice beforehand, because no matter what I say, I will be so nervous that the words will come out in a confusing jumble if they are not well rehearsed. If we take the human kindness factor and use it to our advantage in the struggle for marriage equality, then it will ultimately be what helps us win. Imagine, they will be thinking of you at the polls, worried that if marriage equality doesn't pass, that you will be back, and worse, they will think it is their fault and fearful that you think it is their fault too.

Bravery never goes without reward, because luck and fate always side with courage. Pelting people with emails and petitions is the coward's way. The freerepublic.com e- snipers are the perfect example of a spineless attack. They bombard you with hate filled emails, but you will never know them, they will never show their face anywhere, they are too ashamed of their beliefs to really stand side to side with them. Could you imagine conservative bigots actually going door to door? 

When I was at the big protest against the Republican National Convention, there were easily over half a million protesters, and about 11 counterprotesters. They were mostly crazies, with multiple signs tacked onto their bodies and they had to have armies of police surrounding them to make sure that the protesters wouldn't mock them too badly. But again, since the brave are recognized for their bravery, the media published multiple images of the same counterprotesters trying to start fights with the protesters so it looked like there were many, many, many more than actually were there. 

For the most part, the conservatives couldn't ever have a protest march the size of the one in New York because they would never be proud enough to advertise their homophobic hatred out on the street. We have pride on our side. Isn't that enough to make you want to do something? We cannot have equality by degrees. This undermines the entire message and meaning of equality. Equality is an absolute. You cannot give equality to one and then deny it to another. That is not equality, that is something else. That is what we have now. What we are trying to do with marriage equality is bring our nation closer to the dream of democracy. It is less about marriage than it is about properly interpreting the constitution in a fair and just manner, one that is not determined by the religious affiliation of the current administration or the tides of the times. 

A thought that my friend in New Mexico left me with was that this year, it is not enough to vote. We must all be activists. We are being called up, like the draft, to serve our country. The good news is, it isn't overseas, and it's a war we believe in. It's a war for everything we are. Not as gay and lesbian Americans, but as Americans. 

Whatever you decide to do, whether it is go to the house next door and tell them you would like to get married, to making donations to those organizations who are fighting for your rights, to telling everyone you know everything you know about marriage equality, to having a bake sale, to organizing a letter writing campaign, to whatever you think would assist the war effort. If we want to win, we have to get really low fi, analog, hands on. It has come to this. 


*Note From Team Cho: New Mexico is a swinging swing state with 5 electoral votes. In 2000, NM barely went to Gore with 47.9% (Bush: 47.8%). In the most recent Zogby poll, Kerry is up 10 points in NM, although a recent Albuquerque Journal poll has Bush up 3 points over Kerry.

In February of this year, Sandoval County Clerk Victoria Dunlap, issued more than 60 marriage licenses to same-sex couples, until the state Attorney General intervened and said the licenses were illegal (article here). Groups working for Marriage Equality in New Mexico include: Coalition for Equality in New Mexico, Coalition for Gay & Lesbian Rights in New Mexico, Rights New Mexico."

"event","I love the show ""The Best Week Ever"" that is on VH1 on Friday nights...I think the hosts are funny, original and frank. But what if the show were reversed, some sort of cynical, ""The Worst Week Ever""? Then that, my lovelies, would be my week.

Fuck.

  Begin last Saturday. My aunt flew down to her condo in Ponte Vedra for a mini vacation seemingly innocent enough. My mother goes over for a few days and invites me up for Saturday evening for dinner and what not. Sounds good but anytime with those two, its like going to dinner in the lions den, throwing yourself to the beasts. But I'm getting free dinner and a chance to get filled in on the gossip from the city and all those I left behind in NY so I happily oblige.

   Anyways, so my mom tells me that her ovarian cancer surgery two months ago didn't go as planned and that the doctors didn't remove all of the maligant tumor in the ovary and that part of the cells had spread to the utereus. 

Fuck. 

   So chemo is in the future she thinks but we can fight this shit and thats that. She had breast cancer a few years ago and beat that so we are optimistic, this is just taking a little longer than she had hoped, as if you can try to schedule it in to your life.

   After dinner as my aunt flirts relentlessly with the bartender, mind you she is of a certain age and married with three breathtakingly beautiful children, I mean seriously my cousins are like unbelieveably gorgeous, my mother begins with, ""So, Eric, listen, don't tell your aunt I told you but..."" and I'm like oh shit. My mother informs me that the real reason my aunt flew down to Ponte Vedra for the mini holiday was not because she like the sea here better than in Southhampton, not because she wanted to get away from the city, not because she had another plastic surgery procedure and had to escape the glaring eyes of those ladies who lunch but because she discovered that my Uncle John, the American vice president of the Pioneer electronic company, the man she broke the glass with at her lavish Jewish wedding, the man that fathered her three unthinkably hot children is having an affair with a much much younger woman...Twenty years old in fact.

Fuck.

   Thats okay, divorce is typical and she can collect on a handsome reward for dealing with the shit for 20 something years. But, no, not in this dog eat dog, no matter what you do, you're gonna get fucked world. Evidently, my uncle doesn't know that my aunt discovered this and she took the prenupitual agreement they signed to my grandmother's attorney. Good idea to see what shes dealing with. But, no, not really. Evidently, the prenupitual agreement classifies her as what is called a secondary benefactor so in the event that my uncle divorces her, she gets half of everything, the money, the real estate in the city, the stocks and bonds, the home in southhampton, the condo in florida, the cottage in connecticut, the peublo in arizona and the house in manhattan beach, cali. Sounds good. However, if she divorces him, she gets nothing as a secondary benefactor since he earned all the money and all she came in with was her trust fund from my grandparents and a degree from Sarah Lawerence. She gets nothing.

Fuck.

   So should she take her pride, divorce the bitch and start anew? Or should she stay with the bitch, hit 'em up style and drain the bitch's wallet? I'm not sure which she is going to do but I do know Hannukah is going to be very colorful this year.

   Fastforward to Margarita Monday at Scarlett's with karaoke. I'm not really feeling it and don't want to go but I oblige because I know Karel is going to get shitfaced and it is my duty as a college student and as a friend to look after those who cannot look after themselves. So Paul Greener from work and I go down to Scarletts with Karel and I pick ""Dark Lady"" from Cher to do as my song. So I'm out in the car with Paul listening to it one more time so that I can get it in my head and give show stopping performance like I always do. So I'm out in the car jamming to campy Cher and I see Karel stumbling towards the car with a glass in her hand and a SAPD car pull up behind me.

Fuck.

   In the end, I am freaking out and going through my head all the things I could pawn off to bail her out...my extra DVD player and TV, my rosary from Tiffany's and my Louis Vuttion luggage I got for graduation from that same uncle. So the cop goes realitivly easy on her and just gives her a open container/public intoxication citation for $108 and scaring the shit out of her.

I end up not singing Cher.

And I haven't even touched on my shitty ass birthday Wednesday...I'll update that tomorrow."

"event","So this has been a crazy two days. Sunday night I'm over chilling with my girls Lauren and Karel like normal because I'm unofficially moved in to their condo while we search for another home for the fall since the one we were intent on renting for 1300 increased overnight to 1800 when they saw that three responsible college students wanted to rent it. 

   Anyways, so I'm chilling over there and I get a call from Kate Wallace, a friend back from middle school that I've started talking to another since about March of last year. She lets me know that Susan McComas is with here...Susan McComas?!? Omg, I haven't seen Susan since the second grade in ballet classes when we were barre partners. 

   Anyways, so I go over to Kate's condo and get completely shit faced with Susan (Kate passed out really early, I guess thats pretty convienent since she is a sister and the frat guys love that). So Susan and I are plastered with this guy that she brought along, Mike or something...he wasn't extremely impressionable, and get completely naked and go to the ocean for a good hour or so. But, Susan has the key for the beach access gate to the condo and drops it in the waves while we are frolicking completely naked...fuck. So being as drunk as we are we think we can swim around and catch the key before its whisked out to sea, never to be seen again. Of course, we never find the key and are locked out of the gate... Completely naked. Fuck. I don't exactly remember how we got into the gate from there but I definitely remember some yoga-pilates-Madonnaesque contortions that would have been perfect if I were in bed with some WET lube and an Austrailian hottie.

We decide to tell Kate that she, in fact, lost the key while she was drunk.

   Susan and I eventually get to the pool and say good night to that guy and then we, I swear to god, held this sexual embrace in the pool for like 45 minutes that would have the ultimate for any straight guy but didn't really phased us at all at the time. 

   We dry off and go into the house where I proceed to call Trey, the infamous exboyfriend that I still have a slight thing for and who definitely still has a thing for me. Anyways, he evidently caught his current beau smoking crack in the bathroom at his aunts house. Trey's standards have evidently skydived into the pits of welfare level drug abuse since we broke up. We talk for an hour and I get nostaliagic. But I'm not going to lower my standards to get laid. No, wait, to have a relationship...there are no standards for just fucking, I suppose.

   God, this took longer than I thought...I'll update about lasts nights run in with the law at Scarletts (TEASER handcuffs are involved) and ""The Adventures of The Sweet Potato Queen and The Metrosexual Cowboy: A Trip to Cingular and Wal-Mart"" next time."

"event","Fuck. So I got up at 8.30 this morning to be at the campus by 10 because I had a tour at 10 and 11 but evidently Brittany decided to rearrange my schedule while I was gone on Wednesday and took those two tours and now I have a 1 and 2.30 with single families, which is a bitch because I have to talk more and be all one-on-one and shit. DOn't get me wrong, I love doing the tours but I love large group tours more. Anyways, so now I'm up for the day.

   Tuesday night was a blast. My girl Lauren and I went to Tampa for ESPN's FightNight and had ringside seats. I didn't know if it was boxing or white trash wrestling when I originally agreed to go with her to replace her fuckup of a ex (we hope) boyfriend and I was thinking, ""What exactly is kosher to wear to a white trash event on a Tuesday night in Trampa?"" So I hoped for something a la Ocean's 11 George Clooney and glamorous and settled with a hot hot hot floral print shirt from that I bought with Rachel last weekend and my newest favorite accessory, the brown pinstriped fedora. And it worked perfectly. 

   The crowd was really chill with hot metrosexuals all over and a Scottish military guy in a kilt that was adamant about trading me and Lauren a peek under his kilt for the fedora. I swear to God, this exchange lasted at least 3 rounds and he kept grabbing our arms to push them up his leg, evidently to get a handful of his Scottish love. He was cute and the kilt was sorta sexy in a Mel Gibson/Braveheart sort of way but I knew at any moment those hot metros could metamorphesize into raging heteros and beat my ass, so I graciously yet regrettably declined a nice grab.

   More about my hot fedora...get this, on the way out, as I was in what was basically a headlock because Lauren was ABSOLUTELY SHIT FACE DRUNK (thanks to much love from Long Island), this group of guys, actually pretty cute, where like, ""dude, thats him, thats that guy from that movie, that ""Win a Date with a celebrity."" (Tad Hamilton) Do you think of Topher Grace (also from American Pie) when you see me? I don't know, perhaps. But anyways, Lauren whips around, all of a sudden completely  sober and coherent, and is all like, ""Sorry, guys, no autographs or pictures tonight. We're just trying to enjoy a night out without paparazzi."" And they were all like ""omg, it was him...thats so cool. We love you man!"" 

You see, its destiny, I meant to be a star. I already look like one.

   So I'll get pics from this weekend to post...including my trip to Gville and Slowcala to see my girl Rachel.

   I pulled my old Yankee cap out of a box last week and I've been wearing it nonstop since. Awww...I miss NYC. And it looks super hot on, I feel sorta frat boy."

"event","Okay, so I've been on the house hunt for the past few weeks and found a few I like, but none as much as this one of Saragossa, about a block from school. I'm in love! Love!

   Lauren, Karel and I are looking to live together next year because the dynamics between us work. We get along great, have ""lived"" together before, and have such different personalities that its a great match for living together. And we're just so much fun, I mean, damn, who wouldn't want to live with us?

   So this house. Oh my god, this house. Absolutely fuckin amazing! I think it may be even nicer than my family home! Its a four bedroom, 4 and 2 1/2 baths, two story home in the colonial style. In the historic district, it features hardwood floors, 
crown molding, high ceilings, three fireplaces, huge backyard with a large, tiered brick patio with a cabana and terrace, wrap around front porch and a beautiful balcony.

   The problem is, the owner lives in massachusetts and is listing the property through a realtor here in town, i called the realtor and he claimed that the owner doesn't want to rent to anyone under 30, and he does have the right to discriminate if he independently lists the home but because he is going through a realtor, the laws of Equal Housing do not allow for age discrimination.

   So we have three options: 1. meet with him and convince him that we are responisble, financially secure, mature yada yada yada. 2. my roomate lauren's boyfriend's mom is a real estate tycoon here and town, buying and selling for profit each month, we could have her talk to the realtor and work out a deal or 3. get the realtor to put it in writing that they wil not rent to under 30 and then turn it into a lawsuit with the ACLU for discrimination, not necessarily to go to court but to prove the illegality of the situation and just to be bitches.

   God, I love this house. I want this house. Soooo badddd."

"event","So today, I got up this morning at 8am, watched the Today show, made breakfast, got my paycheck, took care of some banking issues, went to the gym and am ready for my tour at 1pm. I was so effective this morning and I should be impressed but I'm sorta let down. Why? Because now, I have nothing to stress out about or run around for for the rest of the day. The chaos needs to start again. I'm bored.

   In other news, my paycheck wasn't as large as I had anticipated so I'm on the edge of a slight panic in regards to the CFTC trip and all the glamour and grandeur Amy and I are requiring. It'll work out though, I think. Another credit card may be in the future. Not good. Not good at all."

"event","You know that feeling you get when you see someone for the first time, you don't even know their name or anything about them but you just know that they are a complete bitch and can't help but make a snide remark to them? I did that today. I didn't feel bad either.

   Karel and I turned into Ladies Who Lunch today and dined at the Yallah Cafe on San Marco...quaint, dark and not busy at all. However, I loved my Fatula pita and Karel and I commented on how this would make an exciting venue for a future engagement. I'll keep you posted.

   Being at Yallah reminded me of my dear Rachel's infamous 20th birthday at Kasba in Jax...and more importantly the ride home. ""Get me off this fuckin rollercoaster...I hate Osama."" Classic Rachelism.

   Birthday coming up August 4th. Not terribly excited. I always have huge celebrations. Last year we rented the Voodoo in Gainesville for sushi and martinis and then went to the Red Party (thrown in my honor) at JetSet, it was an indredible evening...Anyways, Rachel and I were tossing around a theme idea for Metro but with her relocation nothing evolved. So Karel and I tossed around some ideas today over lunch but its hard to do with so little of my Flagler friends in town and so little of others willing to travel here. Something will work. It has to. I can't spend my night like I've been spending others recently, watching an entire disc of Sex and the City a night until at least 2am while eating a boxed pizza. Sure, I'm content, its actually relaxing for me.

   I'm looking for a new home. I like the apartments above the Energy Lab and Butterfield Garage galleries. I want something cosmo loft chic with white oak floors and high ceilings with crown molding and a large kitchen and larger living room. I want a bar area. I want to entertain. I want to throw parties.

   Gearing up for this trip to Sobe for the CFTC next week. Should be a blast. It better be for the money I'm spending, lol. Kidding, Amy. Looking to go to Twist on Thursday night, Niki's Beach on Friday and Mansion on Sunday, I think, and Opium Gardens on Sunday. May have the days/clubs screwed up but none the less will be an amazing time with Amy's friends. Here's some links of the places we're staying, doing and suggestions from my friend Ayinde...check them out!

"event","Last night went marvelously well, for those of you vehemently desiring the salacious details of the evening. After an afternoon of primping and changing no less than seven times with the ever vigilant guidance of my girl Savannah in Jacksonville. Thank you to Scott as well for the the final critique. I settled with a thick fitted black button-up with a pair of white linen pants and squared toed shoes. Hair a bit more natural since its growing out and getting nicely curly. Still debating whether or not to grow it out and if I should have it straightened. I'm inspired by Kyan on Queer Eye, he has a great head of hair .

   Anyways, we had dinner at Buca di Beppos, one of my favorite restaurants of all time. It was his first time there so he definitely had a good time. And I am definitely having my birthday at the Pope table, fyi. Afterwards we went to my girl Savannah's house and chill with Scott and her roommate Ashley, whom I can't decide is genuine or not. We joined a party across the hall for a girl name Tasha who I met last time I was there when we needed ice to mix drinks with. It was definitely lesbos-a-go-go all over. It was fun just the same. The girls were all really nice. Josh and I mingled for a while and were a real hit among the ladies and then retreated back across the hall for a mini make out session that was quite nice. He left a little after and I crashed with Savannah and had an incredible discussion about everything. I love that girl.

   Josh called me this morning to tell me he had a great time and that he couldn't wait to see me again. And invited me over to watch a movie tonight but I had to decline since I have an early morning tomorrow but we made plans to see each other Friday and Saturday so I'm definitely excited about that.

Color me blushing."

"event","So tomorrow night, Wednesday, I have a date. A real date. And I'm actually excited  about it; normally I'm just nonchalant about going out with a new guy because it normally turns out at the end of the night, regardless of amazing conversation and shared interests, the other person just wants a little ass and I am willing to give it to them. Or like my last date, the virgin freaks out after I kiss him and he has a nervous breakdown complete with a crying bit and shaking seizures. 

   But I think this is different. At Metro on Saturday night, after going with my girl Savannah, her ex-drag queen friend Scott (aka Barbara Streisand) and the above mentioned virgin who claims he just wants to be friends...and friends with all of my friends, friends so close he calls them now and not me, but I'm not bitter, I just pity the first guy at FSU in the fall that gets in his pants because the boy will probably pass out and loose his pulse. 

   Anyways, at Metro on Saturday night, Scott introduced me to one of his friends, one of his cute friends, Josh, and I spent the next three odd drunk hours flirting and dancing with this guy. Great dancer. Really great dancer. Okay, yeah, REALLY great dancer. Anyways, at the end of the night he asks for my number and says he wants to hang out again. I admit I was skeptical since it was a club and we were drinking but I get butterflies. 

   So the next day, THE NEXT DAY, he calls, not like late night or whatever but less than 12 hours later at 2pm. He says he knows there are certain rules regarding how soon to call but that he didn't care about those since he was interested and wanted to talk to me again. Oye! Okay, so I'm like wow, this kid is sincere and we plan to meet Wednesday night for dinner and drinks and he asks where I'd like to go. I tell him I'm not sure what I feel like yet but evidently I had told him on Saturday night in my drunken rambling that I loved Buca di Beppo's...so he says he remembers me saying that it was my favorite restaurant and suggests that we go there. Wow, drunk and he was still listening to me and digesting everyword. I'm pretty impressed.

   So after some phone confusion today as to who was to call and make reservations, I call Buca di Beppo's only to find out that not only has he made reservations for two but that they are in Passion Cave, a romantic booth for two.

Wow. Color me impressed and butterflied."

"event","Last week, an odd rumor circulated up through the Midwest. There was talk of a slaying of a teenage homosexual male by a group of vigilante types who had decapitated him and carved ""F-A-G"" into his forehead. I thought that this would be all over the news immediately, yet, when I looked into all my internet news sources, nothing was found. I kept looking. The facts were hazy and few. It had apparently happened in Illinois and was described as a kind of revenge killing in the name of Nicholas Berg, but that was about it. 

Why was this an urban myth going around? Am I guilty of spreading it further? I just want to know, did it or did it not happen? I looked everywhere, from police blotters to the obsessive compulsive's favorite news provider, YAHOO!, reporting around the globe in seconds flat. If anyone knows what I am talking about, please write me and let me know. 

This incident spurred me to research historic cases that were clearly motivated by hatred. James Byrd Jr.'s horrible death by dragging in Jasper, Texas was one I looked back on. It is a sad story, making me sick in the senselessness of it, the violence of it. The man who was convicted of this murder has a hard time in on death row because there are so many Black people who want to tear him limb from limb. 

I would like to tear that man apart myself, frankly, because the crime is incredibly, unbelievably inhumane, and the punishment for it seems like it merits the loss of my own humanity. He was even rejected by the Imperial Wizard of the Klan, who lived in the town just next to Jasper at the time of the Byrd's murder. The Ku Klux Klan renounced him. You have to be just shitty if the fucking KLAN says they don't want to have anything to do with you.

He maintains his innocence, which is certainly possible, however, he has numerous tattoos celebrating Aryan power. He even has a large image of a Black man hanging from a tree emblazoned on his arm. You can bet he doesn't ever go to the showers without multiple guards flanking him. I am sorry for him, that hate would consume so much of him that it isn't enough to have the emblems of it embedded permanently into his flesh, he had to live out the stupid shit on his arm like it was the story of his life. Like it was fucking directions telling him what to do. What an asshole. And who the fuck would do that tattoo?

Tattooing is an ancient warrior art with a kind of infernal beauty few understand, and less take as seriously as they should. What self respecting tattoo artist would say - ""Oh - okay, lynching. Gotcha!"" Maybe I have no idea the array of Aryan tattoos readily available. Maybe the alleged killer's tattoo is one you could pick off the wall, right next to the ""MOM"" or the anchor, or the playing cards. Man's Ruin. 

The fact is, that this nation brought slaves here from Africa was the biggest hate crime of all. Then when the slaves were freed, there wasn't anywhere for them to go. Then there was the wave of terror the Ku Klux Klan began that never really ended. Then there is the fact that none of this is taught to children in American History, at least not the details. They are skimmed over in order to get from the Revolutionary War to landing on the Moon as quickly as possible . 

Then there are the laws against homosexuality. Then there is the Asian exclusion act. Then there is the internment of Japanese Americans. I am not even going to talk about Guantanamo. And then there is the first American hate crime; taking this land from the Native Americans. 

We can keep it up forever. Hate crime Trivial Pursuit. There are enough hate crimes to play a decent round. I'd hope I could play it with Cornel West, bell hooks, Harvey Milk, Martin Luther King, or even just a cool gang of ACLU lawyers. 

I just want to love everyone. I don't care if that sounds stupid. I want to love everyone."

"event","I've vacationed in Mar-a-Largo. I've summered in West Hampton. I've spent time on the west coast. I've toured the Mediterranean coastline. I've hiked the mountains of New Zealand. OKay, maybe not the last one, but nonetheless, I have never had a dull summer. So when I found out I'd be roughing it in Saint Augustine for almost five months I was less than excited, if you will. It's dull enough during the school year with tons of drunken nights and petty drama, how could five months without Flagler work for me?
   It has marvelously. I'm in a new apartment...it is in immediate need of some queer eye but I'm happy with it. My new roomies and I drank a few beers (yes! beers if you can believe it) last night after I was already drunk from karoke at Scarlett's with my girls DK Karel and Cupcake Lauren, I of course, did a scandalous rendition of Sweet Charity's ""Hey Big Spender,"" complete with a striptease and lap dance for DK Karel.
   Rachel, Allison and I went to Plush last week for a faux MTV casting call but did get to hang out with some cast members from the Real World and this has just further fueled my desire to appear on the Real World. I made it to the final round this season and I think I've done at lot of growing since then so we'll see, anyways.
   Lauren, DK Karel and I are going to Metro Friday night which is convienent since my favorite porn star, Matthew Rush will be there. That should be interesting to say the very least.
   I'm working at the Casa Monica which is exciting and at Savannah Sweets which is not. I really do hate it but its easy money. Crystal's manager skills are so flawed. But I'll stay untill I find another minial job.
   I keep getting distracted by this student travel site. God, I wish I could budget my money better so that I could travel Europe on my own. No more family trips, they were always so structured and boring. I want to work in Europe for a summer I think. Live in hostels, eat at cheap cafes. I want to travel more in the wine country of Italy. We briefly stopped in Tuscany one year but I don't remember much of it. Since seeing ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" with Diane Lane, wonderful wonderful romantic movie and not just in the love story sense, romantic in a sense of independence and self-realization. Okay, everyone, I am going to save $2500 by the end of the spring term to take a semester off and travel Europe. It's official. If I don't do it now when am I going to?
   Anyways, I'm tired and need to study so I can go back to Rachel, Kristin and Jen's house. I'm really really enjoying my summer with them. They are amazing girls and I love them to death. Rachel is my Karen and I am her more masculine and hotter and more stylish and less flambouyant (okay maybe equally? fine more so) Jack.

Here are so pics from my summer adventure thus far...

"event","I'm watching Larry King and wondering why he hikes his shoulders so high up. His elbows lean across the all too familiar desk and he seems to have his chair slightly too low. I believe this will give him back trouble and it concerns me. 

He is concerned, as we all are, because the pictures and video of the prisoner abuses in Iraq have been viewed by Congress. Apparently, they are worse, far worse than anything we have seen so far. 

Yet there is a paradox. In the wake of media assault on the public with the footage of Nicholas Berg's terrible death, the prisoner scandal has been eclipsed. The word used by the congressmen present to watch and review all the photographic evidence of the abuse, is 'heinous' - although one of them kept saying it was ""hyenaous"" which made me want to throttle him.

Another word used was ""barbarous."" Barbarous just conjures up images of Conan (the Barbarian not the talk show host), swords and sandals, impalement, and people being drawn and quartered. Barbarians are inhuman. This word makes them seem more like monsters encountered by Jason and the Argonauts than human. ""Heinous,"" although, a bad thing, and definitely something to be reckoned with (and to be released to the public), is slightly softer. It is veiled in a kind of secrecy, behind pixilation. It is to be viewed with discretion. It is the skeleton in the closet, the Pandora's box yet unopened. 

Now the Bush administration is using the death of another innocent child, Nicholas Berg, to indict the 'barbarians.' By showing the beheading over and over on the news and the internet, like we were locked in some ""Faces Of Death"" marathon, they stir up anger and the public's 'patriotic' rage, letting us forget that we have been at least equally barbarous ourselves.

I don't justify actions on either side, but we must remember, we started it. ""We didn't start the fire,"" Billy Joel would sing, when his music and driving got bad. He may not have started the fire, but he did write some righteous songs (GLASS HOUSES is a masterpiece, and just for that, all is forgiven and I remain a lifelong fan), but in this case, we actually did start the fire. George W. Bush started a war with Iraq to punish them for 9/11 when they actually had nothing to do with it. Now, we have destroyed their country, committed dire offenses in the name of 'freedom,' and lost too many of our own children for what basically amounts to a lie.

I worry about Larry King's shoulders, for he seems to carry so much weight on them, showing America its dirty drawers five days a week. However, this has not altered my deep, complex affections for Aaron Brown. 

This is a Holy War. Strange. There is so much religion in the world, but only enough to make us fight over who is right. Not enough to make us love each other."

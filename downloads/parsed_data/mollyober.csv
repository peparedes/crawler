"event","so for a while now i've been thinking deeply about what on earth other people would want to read about... from me. <br /><br />i'd love to write about <a href=""http://thinkindigo.livejournal.com/"">ethan</a> and how wonderful he is but most of you already know him and love him. he writes extensively about his life and the places in which i interface with it so that topic is already covered. <br /><br />most interesting in my life is the work that i do. for those who don't know i am finishing my psy.d. in clinical psychology. i've focused my clinical work on children and adolescents who have experienced <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder"">complex trauma</a>. especially kids who are in the foster care system (which incidentally i have a lot to say about- which i will save for another time).&nbsp; i'm desperately trying to finish my dissertation which is on adult mental health outcomes of foster care alumni. once that is complete i will be done school (forever?). it's a huge project so it's difficult to motivate just taking the stacks of paper out and arranging them so that i can do edits.<br /><br />i'm finishing up internship and feeling enormously guilty about leaving my clients- most of whom have complex trauma and who have developed trust in me over the past year. i am doing exactly what hurts them the most- leaving. there's been a fair amount of crying (mostly them, although it's hard for me not to tear up when people say heart-wrenching things about me being the first person they've ever been able to talk to... ouch). one boy in particular is constantly on my mind. he's hospitalized right now for suicidal ideation and we JUST began connecting after 9 months of him pushing and pulling. adults are not safe or predictable and are not generally worth his trust. i gained his trust. and now, i'm leaving him. just like everyone else. how is that not supposed to confirm everything he believes and nail the door even more securely shut. is it going to take even longer the next time? did i do more harm than good?<br /><br />so these are my struggles.<br /><br />i did get a new job that offers something a bit more like my internal model of what good care is. i'm working at a residential treatment program for adolescent girls with complex trauma. long-term, intensive, systemic work- not one hour in my office once a week. i'm excited.<br /><br />so now that i've written something i feel that i can request friends. <br /><br />m.<br /><br />"

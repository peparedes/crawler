"event","Not much to update for this week.  I'm going to try to keep updating this website because as I've said before; I prefer the website where all the pedophiles are at *cough*myspace*cough*

^_^

Let's see.  Last time I updated, I saw freaky unbalanced boy in a car driving pass.  That same day, I had received my grades from my classes for the semester.  Good news is nothing lower than an ""c"".  Even better news: the grade was in my general education class (I didn't really give it my all in that class anyway)  >.<

Computer Animation: Maya ==>  A
I know!! An 'A'!! I'm still fainting every time I'm seeing the print out of my grades.  The teacher hated my guts, he just thought he was being very discreet when he was saying things about it.  Who've thunk he'd give me that letter.  Rest assure; I'm still trying to double-check if he's going to change it this coming week.  LOL.

Animation Camera and Sound: ==>  B-.
Not bad considering the halfway mark I was getting a 'B'.  I had to stress over gen ed's final project and family too.  The minuses and pluses don't really do anything; the letter's the most important thing (and my employer won't be so fond of grades in the first place)

Gen Ed class: ==> C.
Didn't like the sub teacher.  First teacher wasn't really there.  It's a science lab and we only had a lab class ONCE with another fill-in teacher.  No one stuck to the syllabus...pft.  If I really wanted to, i would contest the grade, as long as they don't lower it.  If they do; well the principal, vice, dean, and most staff don't like the entire floor they work on anyway.  Of course it helps knowing someone that was on the board that's in charge of all the colleges in the nation  ^_^  Oh please piss me off.

Between all of that and having some 'aha' moments to keep up with my summer schedules; I've been a busy little chocolate latte; but I'm dealing.  I'm not to the point I need to slit anything so...I think things are looking up.

TTYL people."

"event","I'm just getting over coming off the high school had me on from finals.  I was minding my own business; planning on heading to the bookstore.  All of a sudden, I hear some guy from a car call out ""Hey.  Hey!!"".  At first I had assumed that he was speaking to somebody else, so I kept walking.  Next thing I know I heard ""HEY!"" louder this time.  I had recently helped a couple looking for Randolph and Michigan to get to their destination; so I had a fleeting notion that maybe this guy needed help as well.  I go to look at the driver's seat and it wound up being someone I was hoping that I didnt' have to run into for some time.  It was DAVE!!!! yea; the weirdo-stalker Dave I had previously informed you all about.  Still a bit in shock, I heard him tell me 'Hey! You have a nice blouse'.  I didn't have anything to say because my stomach felt as if it immediately turned to stone and no words could form a sentence to retort back to his statement.  All while this was happening, my cell phone had rung, so automatronically I had went to retrieve it.  I look to see my mom's work number and had automatically thought ""<i>I can't deal with this right now</i>"" and hung up on her (sorry ma.  '^_^).  He continuously told me he thought my blouse looked nice (even though it's a pink jacket) until I gave him an answer.  What do you tell someone that was stalking your friends and threatening bodily harm to anyone that gets in his way of what he wants??  

But anyway, I did answer him finally; though I barely remembered what I said.  Whatever it was, it was enough to get him to continue down the street and out of my eyesight.  I was turning to rush away from the spot when I had immediately thought about trying to catchi his license plate.  By the time I turned around however, he was already turning the corner (note: this block is pretty long so he was zooming out of sight).

There was nothing else I could do except notify friends and security and maybe security could do something about it.  I didn't get that restraining order for nothing!! not even 100 feet from me!! (it would be bad enough there's eye contact) I'm not trying to be mean, I'd just hate to have to kill the bastard (or attempt to) because nothing was finalized and he may indeed have superhuman abilities when it comes to the supernatural (which would mean my edge I usually have on others would be false)  T.T

More to come later...

"event","I'm a fan of Myspace, so it's rare that I come here; but alas; here I am.  I have been so busy with school, that's it hard to come on here, just sit, and write my heart out.  I would feel guilty for not getting more homework done sooner or with a better quality.  Geez; is it May yet? 

Anyway: I'm here to update people that feel like checking out my page.  i have even more questions than before about the difference of my identity and my REAL identity.  I know what I am; but for once in my life I would like to know WHO I am.  I know who I am is a variation of all the events that have happened in my life and my interpretation of said events along with the possible lesson that has derived from it, however I'm still not sure about all of that.  I walk around in my waking life dazed and confused.  My sleep feels more real to me than my waking state (even though it's about killing people or someone penetrating my defenses and killing me), I feel as if I can't talk to anyone about these problems; I'm not sure what it is I'm looking for and which direction to even start looking.  I know my answer is out there, I just wish the way to obtain my treasure was easier to reach than the way I am going about it now.  This entire world is envisioned through a filter of lies and deceit that I feel no one else can see but me.  I try to explain my findings to people in order to break them free from their bondage, but they shoo me away as if I am something too insignificant to matter.  There are other places I suppose I should be at this time (incarcerated, nut house), but fortuantely I haven't broken the law, so I don't think I will be winding up in those places anytime soon.  

I feel as if I'm stuck within this rut that I cannot see, taste, touch, or smell.  I feel my way around the dark mist, but I cannot find an exit; for to know where to go, I would have to know an entrance.  Neither are found.  The fog is surrounding my senses and overwhelming my sense of being; I feel completely submerged and as if there's not a damn thing I can do about it to stop it.  I want the exit, but I can't find it: a constant cycle endlessly searching day after day after day for weeks; months; years; decades.  it is surprising that because of this my mind has not completely turned to mush and made me go stark-raving mad.  This along with family problems; I am constantly surprised that I haven't turned into a lesbo chasing, alcohol guzzling, coke snorting, manic depressive, satanist practicing, american-african female instead of the being I am today.  I use the word being instead of human because to be human is to be bound to time, rules, and most importantly: EMOTIONS.  In order to transcend thought, one has to sacrifice what one was in order to become what one wishes.  Not crazy about being human with the mass murders taking place every generation due to the fact that humanity is too stupid to actually remember the things that constantly happen throughout history to keep from repeating; so why not try another specie I figure?  And everyone knows that pain causes knowledge and with knowledge comes understanding and only through understanding can we ever thrive to the next step of the evolution.  Humans can go ahead and kill themselves; I'm not exactly inclined to.  

That is all; for now."

"event","Well, this weekend turned out to be such a crappy weekend. I was suppose to go see ""Hostel"" with a friend.  I've been making sure I didn't have any chocolate 3 days prior to go seeing it so the lack of energy I would be experiencing mixed in with angered emotions I would have on a daily basis ALONG WITH my monthly cycle would form a huge PMS bout that would have me kill the first male I see on the street.  SO naturally, going to see a film where men would have their fingers/hands/limbs/feet chopped off and their eyes ripped out of their sockets would interest me.  I wouldn't of been surprised if I had laughed so hard, people would leave my immediate vacinity in fear that something was terribly unstabble about me; to which I would laugh even harder yelling out ""I AM THE BURGER KING!!"" 8oD.  Unfortunately, my friend cancelled on me at the last minute and since I didn't wanna go see it without a friend (wouldn't be as fun), I decided to spend time with family -- big mistake.  My dad was being more of an ass than usual and my mom kept escaping to go to work and finish up whatever she needs finishing up.  I decided to be smart this time and go along with her in case I had made a huge mistake and try to out-talk my father which, the only way I'd do that is to curse up a storm and be kicked out of the home.  The only good thing I've found out is that they're all cool about the curfew thing; my problem is that I still try to make it home by at least midnight because I'm worried about them staying up and worrying unnecessarily aboout me instead of trying to get a good night's rest.  I think I only come home at that time for my mother because my dad; pfft.  I could honestly care less.  I know he's there for my physically and financially sometimes for the things I may/may not need, but it sucks to hear that you need some things and all you hear is ""no no no no no.  I have bills.  I have bills to pay.  I don't got it.  I can't.  I have bills.  No no  no no. (fill in rest)"".  So I guess he might still like me, but I'll be damned if I know or not because I can't tell.  *Sigh*. I just want to stay at a bookstore until they close and have the option of heading over to a 24-hr diner, sit and drink some coffee and maybe have a slice of cake/pie.  Why is that such a bad thing?? I just don't understand.  I mean, it's not like I'm going to be able to do that when I move out; hencefor I'm trying to do it now because once I get a job, that WILL be my off time.  I get sick of my job, I focus my energy back onto school.  Vica-versa until I either graduate or finally get picked up by Electronic Arts, create my own studio, or Studio Ghibli (But I'm pretty sure we know which one will come first, don't we?) i haven't been able to talk to my friend since July and I was facing the problem with L.A. Dreamer and I'm having some ""issues"" with life that now I have to start practicing a bit more so I can try to maintain my control over my primal self.  The problem is, when I do that (which I've tried to sworn off attemtping EVER again), doing such would make the other side of me stronger than the previous time which is what I'm used to.  So essentially, I have to take my game 2 steps ahead to keep supressing that other side of me.  And here I was wondering why I'm not taken yet.  I'm worried about supernatural forces, friendship links breaking unknowingly, trying to move out of parent's place because they're driving me up a wall, my portfolio for animation companies to take a look at, working on a production comapny idea, studying different possibilities for stories in my portfolio, figuring out how to graduate before the year 2010; it's no wonder why I'm not worried about looking for my mate -- at this point might have to be female because I'm convinced my husband's in a hospital on life support right now :o_(  But then there's the whole intimate thing -- then again, I'll stick with men.  *sigh* Life sucks; but then again if you read my journals, you'd know that I say that all the time.  Just enough to make you slit your wrists in a bathroom and just fall asleep in some warm bath water.

BTW Char, still hard to contact you due to not having a phone of my own.  Have to share because I don't have money to pay off my already outstanding bill (WOuld you believe they sold my number after saying I would of payed them off?!?!? Now I have to get a whole new number Arrggghhhh!!!!) Care to catch a flick sometime before school starts because I'm going to be even more busy than I had been before.  Wish me luck sweetie."

"event","Woot!!! Guess who has enough money to go sit in a theatre!!  Oh yea, that's right.  And i know exactly what movie I want to see.  I was trying to save enough forever for Aeon Flux, however since the only place it's playing has a matinee price of $7.50, I've decided to change my movie-going experince from action to ""crapping in my pants"" horror.  For those that don't know what I'm talking about, I'm going to go see Hostel and laugh at the people that need to be taken out on stretchers foaming at the mouth because the movie was ""too much for them to handle"".  I say, if it was too much for them to handle, try entering thearer 5 instead of 4.  I'm pretty sure they're still showing Harry Potter or ""Chicken Little"" somewhere.  Hahahahahahhhhhahahah! HAH!

I'm actually happy, it's such a warm feeling to have.  Gonna go see a movie that has more blood stains in a room than a butcher shoppe.  And from some of the american and overseas previews, it seems the people get off on it.  How fun! ^_^

Well, can't stay long, have to get home and make sure everything's set (as well as work on portfolio: i'm contstantly working on my portfolio now.  *shrugs*) so I have enough free time to interpret what I'm gonna go see for about 2 hours on a screen  Finally!! The ideas on my head will be seen on a jumbotron.  W00t!!!

And btw: Char, Happy New Year's.  When are you off so we can hang out, I've got a lot to tell you and after reading your journal, you've got some stuff to tell this vanilla (though the only place I'm a vanilla in)"

I had a really bad nightmare the pass weekend.  Let's just say it had to do with a man, not enough running space, and a billy club.  Wouldn't mind it so much, but it was one of those feely dreams.  T.T  I didn't know my heart beat could beat so fast; I thought it was going to leap right out of my chest.  Gaia knows it hurt like it was going to.  >:(  Nothing like waking up and having your body feeling bruised as if you were beaten the previous night.  Of course, this wasn't the first kind of dream I had had that happen with.  The last one was where I was dreaming about something or other, someone was chasing me around a boat, then finally got a good spot and shot me in my side.  In my dream I physically felt pain and when I would wake up...EVERY DAMN TIME I WOULD WAKE UP, I would have a nasty ping in my side as if I had fell on something that had jabbed me real good.  Problem is...nothing's on my floor and my bad springs (which have now been replaced with a foam pad.  One word: *ssssssiiiiiiiiiiggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh*) could not possibly make that happen.  So the next question would be: what did?? I know it can't be my parents because....WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Anyways, on a semi-lighter note, my New Year's Resolution is to try and not be so pessimistic about life and not look so negatively upon situations that occur.  Try to be as open-minded as I was in high school and give each and every opportunity the same chance as if I had never interacted with something of that nature before (basically keep myself somehow full of hope, happiness, and bright, shiny, gushy stuff.  *eye roll*) Also very hard to do when I have to share things with a friend.  A very demanding friend that doesn't want you to question anything.  I kinda wonder why I even search for a significant other; I'm so busy with the kind of life I have now, it's surprising that I even care at times.  Also, with despising men physically at times (then again, I hate ANYONE that wants to put their arm around me during my PMS bouts anyway -- male, female, or intersexual), being shot/abused by them emotionally and psychologically through dreams, and mentally not being able to think the way they do because my brain cannot reside within anything in my pants ... I just don't understand how I'm suppose to fall in love and have children by them.  It makes no sense and it seems too intangible; and yet at the same time, I just can't see myself stroking anyone's kitty other than myself so I would NEVER go gay.  *sigh*  Life is really strange, sometimes I wonder if I'm really human at all.  And if I'm not, WHERE THE FCUK (mispelled intentionally) IS MY MOTHERSHIP?!  COME TAKE ME HOME AND COME TAKE ME HOME N-O-W-!-!-!"

"event","This day turned out to be full of horse manuere. My Human Sexuality Seminar teacher hadn't showed up today after I RAN basically from one building to another.  (When doing this, it consists of leaving my 3rd floor classroom located in a building 2 blocks away total.  I have to wait for the elevator to take me and is soon to be at least 10 other students down to the first floor, push pass the people that await upon the first floor as if no one else will be inside the elevator once it is there, and race out of the door of the building.  From there, it is a mad dash one block south and the equivalent of a 3/4 quarter block east, turn the corner, and race another half block south to the next building.  Once entering the building however, the same luck and skill can be compared to winning the lottery.  Four assumptions are made just so you would be able to reach the class on time: <p>1)Do all 4 elevators work?<p>2) If not, how many people are waiting for the remainding elevators?<p>3) If there's a lot of people, what are my chances of being able to make it to the remainding elevators without having to push anyone out of the way<p> and 4) If there's only 2 elevators working, a lot of people, and you have to push your way in; which way is the best way to go to get a good spot for the next elevator ride going up?<p><p> Of course, after you figure all of this out and do make your way to the front, there's always someone else that slips just in before you, keeping you from being towards the back of the elevator and secure a space for the next ride up to the floor of your class.  So after you arrive, hoping to slide in and not disturb the rest of the class, the instructor calls you out and makes sure you're considered ""absent"" for the day.  <p><p>Ya know, school sucks.  the only difference between high school and college is that some of the classes are a little more fun and you have to PAY for the classes you want instead of just picking them for free."

"event","1. Tell me something obvious about you.<p>
I'm not sure why some people consider this about me, but apparently I appear ""overweight""??  I don't seem to understand though, I can run and chase down a CTA bus whenever necessary so is it really fat or just an overabundance of tissues??<p>
2. Tell me something about you that many don't know.<p>
Well, only close circle of friends really know that I don't claim Christianity as my religion anymore.  As a matter of fact, I try not to claim any religion anymore.<p>
3. What is your biggest fear?<p>
Deepest darkest secrets being divulged in a room full of people when I am not ready for them to come forth.<p>
4. Do you normally go the safe route or take the short cut?<p>
Took the short cut, got bruised and came back with something.  Now taking the safe route, but I can feel the short cut calling me.....oh, I'm sorry.  You were asking me something weren't you.   Um.....the answer's 42.  ^_^<p>
5. Name one thing you want that you can't buy with money.<p>
Ultimate knowledge of one's self and that which thrives around her<p>
6. What is your most treasured possession?<p>
All 6 of my HP books, except for #6.  My mom spilled lemonade all over the cover.  AAARRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!<p>
7. What is the one thing you hate most about yourself that you do often?<p>
Sound maternal at times that bugs the hell out of my friends, but out of respect no one says what it is, which is kinda frustrating because in orde for me to change it, I need to know what it is and I can't identify it (I can thank my father for that family trait.  Damn you!!)<p>
8. Tell me something sexually about you that I don't know.<p>
OOOOHHH, naughty naughty.  The LEAST you can do is buy me dinner to know that.  Cuz I'm not a cheap date thank you very much.<p>
9. Tell me something sexually about you that everyone knows.<p>
I crack lewd jokes for the sake of doing so because I can<p>
10. What is your favorite lie to tell?<p>
{Fill in situation here} Oh, see what had happen was...I was walking down this street, right? And I heard this, like, bark in the distance.  So I turn around...and there was this, like big dog.   So....well you know....I start running, right? And then this dog, it started to chase me, right? So I was running, and the dog was like chasing me.  You know what I'm saying right? So that's why {Fill in same situation here}.
11. Name something you've done once that you can't wait to do again.<p>
Hanggliding!!!!!!!  I'mma lose some weight so I can fit more people there with me *cough* Charlotte and Kim *cough*.  Free as a bird, nothing tying you down, and the irony of being free within a caged society<p>
12. Are you the jealous type?<p>
Not necessarily.  Just because you have obtained the latest gadget out on the market, trust in the fact that I'm not losing any sleep on your new gain of property. What you do behind closed doors is YOUR business, not mine.  Just don't come shoot me 3:00 am and we're good. <p> 
13. What is the one person, place or thing you can't say no to?<p>
I know I put my friends above most of my own wantings, but if it really does come down to crunch time, I don't have much of a problem saying ""no"".  It just really depends upon the circumstance.  Unless the matter's life or death, I'm pretty understandable.  That much hasn't changed since high school<p>
14. What is the nicest thing someone has ever done for you?<p>
Oh that's easy.  Hands down buying me dinner at an expensive restaurant because he had money to spend.  I usually hate being treated and rather not have someone pick up the check (I mean, who's chivalrous in this day and age anyway?? Can barely get a guy to hold the door for you unless there's an insult that follows behind it nowadays)<p>
15. If you could do something crazy right now, what would it be?<p>
Shout at the very top of my lungs right where I'm at ""Cum diddle my skittle, because there's only one peach with the HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.  Also, okay a maybe then, run up to a Jehova Witness and try to convert them to Satanism.  LMAO!!!!!! ""Have you had a talk to satan lately""  ROFL!!!!!!<p>
16. When was the last time you cried?<p>
About an hour ago after coming in from outside.  Do you have any IDEA how frecking cold it is out there?<p>
17. When was the last time you felt so good that nothing else mattered?<p>
[img]http://graphics.gaiaonline.com/images/template/smiles/icon_ninja.gif[/img] It was a long time ago and with a subject I'm not quite comfortable talking about, I can only suppress, not make go away.<p>
18. Do you feel comfortable in public with no shirt on?<p>
Not in public, but I can do whatever within the structure of my own dwellings as long as it's not illegal and I don't get caught.<p>
19. Name something embarrassing you did while being drunk.<p>
Well that's easy.  Don't drink so no embarassing stories.<p>
20. If you post this in your journal would you like me to answer it?<p>
Sure, just don't put something stupid like ""your image didn't work"" or ""you spelled { } word wrong"".  You will taste my squirrely wrath if you do.<p>"

Well, last time I left off, I was complaining about L.A. Dreamer, a nigerian boy that was pissing me the fuck off, and a boy named ""Dave"" whom I haven't seen since this past summer.  My semester's pretty crappy.  I have only 2 classes I'm halfway interested in.  One class I'm just about going to fail - even if I pass the final.  the other class is pretty alright, it's just that now the interest has faded and I have a 10-12 page paper due.  Ick!!  Another class I actually like because you take apart computers, but I found out I was nearly failing that, and then there's Computer Illustration.  joy and sorrow; I had to lie to the teacher because one part of my final project wasn't completed and I feel tacky as hell.  Knowing my life, every time I say something that could possibly be a jinx, 9 times out of 10 it happens and it's not the way I would want it to happen - EVER!!  It's a real surprise that I haven't had to go to a funeral yet.  My grandfather died from my dad's side of the family, but I had figured that I never met the man that screwed over my grandmother; why the hell should I even bother to try and show up.  I would be going to someone's funeral and view a bunch of people that the only thing I would share with them is DNA blood traits, but that would be all.  Deciding to skip it, I went to ACEN that happened in Rosemont, IL back in May.  JOY!! http://stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/classic/smile.gif .  But moving back to this semester, I've had pain unlike which I've ever felt before in my mouth to the point where I needed an extraction and surgery done as well (need to go back in Jan to have a cap placed).  I need a new mattress, but in the meantime, I'm in excruciating pain that I'd rather sleep in the living room on a couch, or even a bean bag would feel significantly better.  I've had yet another fall out with my father, even though his day of birth has past as of yesterday.  I've been pissed ever since my birthday after giving him a chance to do something for my 21'st birthday and he has turned my day into his own day full of venting on me and my mother about everything that has happened at his job that he could of stopped at any time simply by telling them to screw themselves with a huge, crusty pole and by giving them his middle finger quoting ""I quit!"".  But instead, as usual, he moves everything that happens at his job over, brings it home, and vents it on us.  Ungrateful bastard! http://stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/classic/angry.gif  And he wonders why I can no longer stand him and want to move out ASAP! Who wouldn't?? 

Anyway, getting back onto the original topic; life sucks, just like usual.  However it has sucked significantly so because I no longer had a phone as of Sept 23 (just in time as i grabbed new names for info on making a portfolio), I lose my phone and because I have no job to keep the payments going (and T-Mobil screwed me), I lost my number and couldn't find my charger so I can call people.  Losing numbers is not fun, and not finding a charger when you have the numbers, but can't get to them is a horrible feeling.  I need a job and I need a job bad so I can hurry up and move the hell out of my parent's home.  Granted, I will miss the abilities of home-cooked meals and free washes, but I'll deal.  I have been doing well so far.  It's fine, I think I've sufficiently dealt with worse.  

Life also sucks because it's kinda hard not to back slide to where I use to be.  I truly think that only sheer determination keeps me focused and heading forward in the positive direction.  However it would just be easier to slip back to my old ways and not give a fuck about humanity or the entire population in general.  Play with a star located inside a circle just to fuck with someone's head.  Yet I suppress the demoness that is inside me, sealing them underneath my blood veins, which is why it's so easy to get my blood boiling.  They say that you can measure a person's character by testing their waters on how quick you can aggravate them.  For me; this tactic is not a smart idea because my patience strand has been worn thin by crappy ass teachers my entire life (since 4th grade to be precise) and it's amazing that I haven't killed anyone with my bare hands as of yet.  If this freaks you out already, imagine living in my day to day operation."

I've ran into a big bump on my ladder to success and now I've been bumped back a year before I'm able to do anything else that will help me to my commencement to graduation.  The ""crazy stalker"" guy I'm still on high alert from, I've ran into a supposed big-connection to Hollywood who would up being a complete flop, and I'm way too close from killing a Nigerian boy that doesn't understand the fact that just because I'm female doesn't mean he can say or do things that suppose to be funny in his mind, not funny to me, and get away with them.  As a matter of fact, if I ever even locked in the same room as this sad sack of crap again, heads will roll.  If i get my way, both of his WILL!

"event","Hello and welcome to my sucky life.  I am about to rant on what's been going on, so if you don't want to hear a bluegrass country song without the instrumental background; it's suggested that you look up someone else's profile.  However if you have time to kill; well it shouldn't matter if you read this or not should it? <p><p>I wasn't for sure what to do with what's been going on in my life, so for some strange reason or another I was compelled to share my expeirences online with whomever wishes to read it.  I suppose if I were to think about it, sharing my intimate experiences on an online journal website might even be healthier (not to mention cheaper) than seeking out a psychologist.  There's the bill per hour, the mind probing, the ""Let me figure this out"" shpeel the guy/girl gives you; it's just a bigger waste of time so they can get that extra minute in and claim yet another hour paid increase.  Bunch of nonsense if you ask me.<p>Well when you last left off with me, I was going through some things that I'm not really done treading through, however keeping them bottled inside me is not helping either.  My problems, I believe, started around late March.  A supposed friend (let's call him Dave) whom I met through a good friend of mine had something happen in his life that suddenly turned him from a pretty cool guy to claim to know, to an all out psycho - stalker - scary guy.  Along with that installment, I have had experiences with a tiny star within a circle that wasn't going so well at the time either, then having to deal with not only a yearly remembrance of an uncle who had past the previous year, but less than a month later to begin the grieving process again with my grandfather's funeral procession.  Then there's school with four classes and only one teacher that rocks.  The second week of March 2004, I was attempting a spell which had been a bit out of my league, though I hadn't known it at the time.  I sat down, drew a penta, sat in the front with my little ingredients all ready to preform it.  As soon as it was underway, there was trouble.  Bowls full of ingredients tipped over, candles went out, line of sugar was blown across the room; it was a big mess let's put it that way.  After a second try, I got the hint when winds started blowing in the room and decided against trying for a third time.  As if that wasn't enough, the very same day my friend <i>Kim</i> had told me of an incident that happened to her the night before in a computer lounge (at my college there's a couple of open internet labs) where <i>Dave</i> had came up to her from behind while she had earphones on and snapped her over the head with the front end of a baseball hat! Apparently he had believed this incident to be funny, but <i>Kim</i> had thought otherwise and made sure she let me know this.  I had not run into Dave since December of 2003 at that time, so I could not comment on his more than rude behavior.  I was told by her to make sure I kept an eye out for him and to be as less talkative as possible when he's around.  I informed her that it was food for thought.  <p>As if that wasn't enough on my plate, I had a boring class which I knew the information to accompanied with a very anal teacher that expected nothing but perfection, yet had an experience complex of ""no matter what you do it could never trump my success"" attitude with the class.  Annoying little f***sandwich IT WAS.  This along with a college instructor that insists that whatever your craft will be once you graduate; not only will you never achieve your goal that you set out for, but shall be ridiculed because of the simple fact that you SUCK.  Being told that on a daily basis after making sure it was too late to withdraw from the class; yea my life was pretty screwed up.  The only upside I had the entire semester was a class that you only used your hands to speak in the morning: Sign Language One.  THAT WAS IT.  That was the highpoint of my week and I had the classes on a Monday and Wednesday from 10:30 - 12:00.  Things quickly began to deteriorate from then, because between school, family, an unknown stalker doing weird shit, and becoming more and more apathetic about the world the more times I lit a candle and threw in some incense, I was on a fast track to misery and suffering and didn't know it until it was W-A-Y too late.  The next big event happened around the thrid week of April.  My friend Kim, once again, told me something weird happened and that she met up with Dave once again.  She didn't want to talk to him, obviously because of what happened previously to her.  What she told me is that he was acting normal, nothing was wrong, and that he EVEN apologized for what he did to her that day.  Then he ""flipped the script"" supposedly when he claimed he would apologize to her only if she would apologize to him (even though there was nothing that she did that would need an apology).  I didn't quite understand what she meant until she told me later on into the conversation that the day she was hit in the head with a baseball hat that she reported the incident to the security guard that works in the comkputer lounge building.  Naturally taking her side, I agreed with her that she didn't have any reason to apologize to him and that he SHOULD apologize for doing such a childish prank against her for someone being over the age of 21.  This was the second incident that happened to my friend and now I was trying my damnest to run into this guy, but I would later find out to no avail. Later on that night, trying a completely different spell, I was curious about ""protection"" amd wondering if it was possible casting it on a person that is more or less has a rather black and white view of how things that are supernatural behave.  Oh, did I mention that all of this was happening while I was supposedly attending a ""bible club""? Yea I know what you're thinking: Well if you want to be a Pagan then why are you in a Christain believing club""? Good question actually. Perhaps peer pressure, doubt, commitment/promise I had made previously to a friend; I wasn't exactly sure.  Now looking at it in heinseight, of course, I realized that even though I was pushing my friends to continue with the club, that I myself had no business being there in the first place.  Anyway; apparently I SILL hadn't done all my research correctly because once again, the charm was incorrect and it cost me. cost me big.  Next thing I knew I was looking at my hand and I saw my third finger bleeding as well as a bit of skin missing.  The problem was that I didn't even realize that this had happened, nor did I know when it started or even how.  My hand was previously hovering over the penta, but I quickly grabbed it away; not knowing of the consequences of blood being spilt over a pentagram and the effects that it might have caused on me at the time.  Rushing to the bathroom to clean it off, I noticed that my shrit had a red spot on the upper shoulder.  Rolling back the sleeve I also noticed that in my skin looked like I had slashed myself with a razor a star; the EXACT star I had made on a paper that was lying on the floor in my room.  Right now as I type to you I manage to get rid of most of the star, but I still have a small scar(?) that remains of the original shape.  The lines don't connect so you almost can't tell.  Figuring I had done enough supernatural-ness for one day, I decided to call it quits, but had some really freaky-ass dreams the night that I preformed that charm.<p><p> Like I said I am going to give you this story in installments.  I would keep typing, but I'm honestly tired and still have to log on to neopets and check to see if <a href=""http://neopets.com/refer.phtml?username=virgo18chick>My Ixi</a> is alright.  
Good night people"

"event","Yes boys and girls, ladies and germs, children of all ages.  It is I, bringing you back into my complicated bitching life once again (Isn't that just what you've always wanted? ^_^).  

My mother; whom I love dearly and care for massively, got a chance to leave early to my grandmother's house way out in Pennsylvania and left me and my father behind.  Not a normal thing, for I would be with her mostly because; my dad is damn boring. ( He's one of those people that when you make a suggestion about something fun to do on a dull day, he'll look at you as if you just made the stupidest comment in history, wait about ten minutes, then make the EXACT same suggestion rewording it, then expect you to praise him because it took a lot of ""hard work"" to come up with such a grand idea ).  Anyway; because I have an exam this coming Friday I wasn't able to go along with her (she rode Amtrak.  I love riding by train, but the prices can come down anytime now ^_^), so I saw her off at the terminal and wished her a happy, safe, well-rounding trip.  It was at this point when I left the terminal that I realized a major problem:  I'LL BE WITH MY FATHER A-L-O-N-E FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK WITHOUT A ""REFEREE"" ( Did I mention that we don't get along well?) ^_^.  My father had dropped her off to the station, waiting for me to return.  Not 10 minutes into traveling had he asked me about morning situations and what I'm going to do about school.  He made me feel as if I was in screwing high school again (note: i'm in college and still broke.  This shall be remedied soon; I HOPE).  
Just for kicks, I mention that I have an early morning class and that I'll use an alarm clock as oppose to relying on heavy-footed family members walking bare-foot across the floor.  Ya know something; for some reason he didn't take kindly to that statement thusly a verbal dispute about what's going to happen in the next week.  The only thing I know is between fighting over chicken, fast food, sleeping times, and lunch; I can only hope to survive this next week without killing the semi-man.

Yea, I know I said I'd tell you everything that happened, but hell, I'm tired.  Im going to sleep now."

"event","Here I am, forced to keep a secret that if I were to let it loose, would cause devastation to everyone around me and to my reputation.  I am sick and tired of everyone considering me to be a sweet, kind, innocent little child when in reality I am  comspiring 17 different methods of chopping off heads, phalluses, and limbs.  I am NOT sweet.  I am not KIND; mostly.  I am a very deceiving person when I need to be.  I don't read a Bible, I can't even remember the last time I had picked one up!<p>
I have not read it, I even stopped once I looked in Revelations that all types of sorcery shall be condemned.  That woke me the hell up.  What about the people that didn't get to have a say in the matter? Should  W E  be condemned as well?  Some people can't help the fact of who they are; goodness knows I can't.  I didn't ask for any special abilities when crossing the threshold of life.  I don't remember THAT being on the menu when I got here, because if I would of known about it, I would of promptly asked for my money back and waited a little longer.  I would rather walk down the street and not have people stare at me.  I feel their accusations before they even reach me.  Their minds being much quicker than their mouths, agitated about how different I am; being a minority within a minority.  I feel their eyes pierce right through my skin, damning every little thing that I do.  Yea so what I'm different.  Isn't that what makes up the human race.  Different races, political stand points, and <b>BELIEFS</b>?<p>
Ok, so you might think I'm paranoid; and perhaps I am a bit.  I'm willing to admit it that it is a possiblility.  However I don't think that I should be persecuted just for the simple fact that I believe my God may be a GODess.  Why should that give anyone the right to prejudge me? I'm human just like anyone else on this miserable planet, I shall vote for Kerry this upcoming November until a Plan 'c' shows itself besides Nader, I am an individual personality yet I don't receive the same respect that anyone else would get.  America's fair my multiracial black ass.<p>
Yea, that's right.  A black pagan.  Shocked 'eh?"

However some of these people are the same who can't work the clock of their VCR so that they may record their soap operas during the week.  

But anyway I stumbled into a website where people can randomly submit their haikus for the entire world to see.  Some I have to admit were good; for instance:

A sharp pain and then,
my hand bounces off to the floor
Bad chainsaw! Bad! Bad!

My stuff was not saved

Damn you AOL
Then I realize just how much of my time was being wasted when I saw this put up here:

Yes, for some reason; you all had to know that.  And the fact that you have read my journal and want to comment on how stupid this might be...It's nearly 23:00 CST in Chicago.  I'm sleepy.  Deal with it!"

What the hell is wrong with the world we live in now? Every little thing we do has to be challenged, everything we have to know is changed, everything we try to understand abruptly changes to something we were not meant to handle, yet we must handle it anyway.    Ths so-called ""world"" we live in can kiss my multiracial behind.  And yes, if you are wondering why I am acting as if I am on PMS, that's because I am.  And if you have a stick between your legs it might be a good thing you are not physically here with me, for that stick would be coming up about five inches SHORTER.  Screw the bloody lot of yas for cursing everything that people work so hard in commiting their lives for.  Screw the freckin bloody bastards.  Go have a long sit down and eat a big bowl of brown!!

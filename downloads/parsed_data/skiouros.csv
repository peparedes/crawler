"event","Despite the presence of a moon unobstructed by clouds and the vibrant illumination of electricity and human progress pulsating into the atmosphere like a rapidly beating heart, the grounds of the Ventrue compound were surprisingly dark. Skiouros frantically shifts his gaze around the perimeter of the sprawling building before remaining transfixed on the imposing and intricately carved wooden entryway doors. He pauses and quietly giggles to himself before following the grooves of the doorway with his hand, mumbling inaudibly to himself. Skiouros sharply removes his finger from the door and retrieves the invitation that Fatima had sent to him requesting his presence after her <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/kindred_haven/14420.html>Camarilla meeting</a>, pausing to glance at it reflectively before tearing it into small pieces of gold colored confetti, festively throwing it in the air, and excitedly fluttering in place as the shredded pieces fell to the ground.

Skiouros nervously fondles wayward pieces of his tail fabric as they undulate in the frigid breeze before returning his attention to the door. He takes his hands and presses them against the door, appreciating the many textures by petting the carvings and the absences that gave them form. After a few moments, he knocks on the door and begins to bounce enthusiastically in place while talking to himself.

""Golden lotus, transcended from the azure pools of fortune and into the crimson throne. Half-filled is the amphora; it is half-empty that one, without effort, sees it. Fruits of the nightshade, rendered unattainable through the casting of oceanic shadows, liquidity sifting through the fingers in a putrid sludge of fuzzy mold. Soon the amphora, filled with the crimson and not with the blackness of the hirsute squids."""

"event","Skiouros inaudibly mumbles to himself before frantically shifting his gaze from the radiant dais table and the partially obscured reflections which reside just underneath its meticulously polished surface to Janus, the newly <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/kindred_haven/13101.html>elected</a> Prince. Skiouros sharply rises from his seat and begins to voyage around the room in amorphous patterns, oscillating his velocity between a manic frenzy and a virtual standstill while randomly undulating and giggling to himself. He places his hands in front of his body and follows them around as if controlled independently of his body, admiring the metallic shininess of his armored gauntlets, until ultimately approaching Janus and addressing him.

""When the scales move, sitting, like turgid streams, floods the crimson fields with fog of many layers, struggling against the winds of excavation. As the water grinds the stone, we rise and fall; even drowning in the flood of sulfured light, we will shine eternal.""

Skiouros tilts his head to the right and remains transfixed on Janus before popcorning wildly in the air, fondling various strips of tail fabric as they make their descent, and laughing to himself. He redirects his focus to Janus' arm, where the interplay of moonlight through a translucent curtain is casting shadows; Skiouros twitches and sharply grabs his arm.

<i>The balmy breezes delicately flowing through the vineyard whimsically blow through the majestic cork trees in the distance, revealing the glossy underbelly of each leaf as they react with the intense moonlight. The thick tendrils of vines dominate a dilapidated medieval castle in the distance, encircling its perimeter and pushing stones away from its foundation. Skiouros wanders through the rows of well-tended grapes until approaching a meadow. A cat, sitting on a nearby rock, approaches Skiouros and contentedly rubs against his feet, its luxurious coat emblazed with radiant stripes of oranges, browns, and grays. 

Skiouros follows the frisky feline as it prances through the landscape until arriving at a concrete table placed near the edge of a cliff. Skiouros approaches the edge of the cliff and gazes at the expansive vista, the charcoal skies dotted with millions of stars, before returning to the table. On the table is a tomato and a fish tank filled with octopi. Skiouros picks up the tomato and stares at it as it undergoes a rapid metamorphosis from edible fruit to an overripe sludge covered in brown fur. Quickly discarding the remnants of the tomato, Skiouros removes an octopus from the tank and places it on the ground near the cat; the cat ravenously bites one of its tentacles, causing a defensive black ink to squirt everywhere. The ink begins to squirt haphazardly in the air, covering the totality of the surroundings in darkness.</i>

Recovering from his period of temporal paralysis, Skiouros releases his grip from Janus as he violently jerks his head back, the momentum of which causes him to tumble to the ground. Skiouros remains silent for a moment, frantically surveying arbitrary points of the room before looking up at the Prince and addressing him with a rushed pace and unusually wide eyes.

""It makes the stars dissolve."""

"event","The moon, intermittently obscured by the passing of clouds, casts irregular and quickly fleeting shadows on the ornately decorated exterior of Blood Haven walls, temporarily marring its highly stylized, sophisticated ambiance with crude swashes of abstracted darkness. Skiouros briefly observes the undulating interplay of light and darkness with an intense fixation before abruptly shifting his gaze toward Luscious, who is standing next to him wearing a bikini constructed out of thick brown fur, turquoise vinyl knee-high boots, and a silver dog whistle around her neck. Skiouros pauses for a moment, lifts his pointer finger, and begins to move it in a circular, serpentine fashion before addressing Luscious.

""Shadows, undergoing their metamorphosis from creation to destruction, so quickly fleeting like the nocturnal brethren in the crimson playgrounds. Alas, the control of this destruction, like the heavenly body itself, is out of reach, the goal separated by layers of empty space needing to be filled with celestial epiphanies.""

Skiouros' frantically shifts his attention to random and disconnected points on the horizon before looking down at his tail, lifting a few pieces of diaphanous purple fabric before giggling to himself and bouncing with manic, nervous energy.

""Although devoid of assless chaps and a repertoire of sexually explicit prose, delighted our Prince would be at the incorporation of purple on my splendorous tail.""

Luscious looks over to Skiouros, places her hand on her right hip, shifts her weight, and does a sassy, stylized triple snap before addressing him.

""Damn, you be one crazy mo-fo! Sometimes I wonder why I don't slap you until my hand hurts, and then slap you for making my hand hurt. I know you think The Prince should be more like Prince, but it ain't gonna happen... and I know you thought it was a good idea that I wear this werewolf fur so they wouldn't attack me, but the fur panties just make me think I should go home, watch my stories, eat some bonbons, and then shave.""

Skiouros, with an overabundance of energy and frivolity, frolicks towards the Blood Haven entrance with a zesty, childlike abandonment. Upon entering the ostentatious interior, Skiouros approaches the heavily textured drapery and presses his body against it, mumbling to himself inaudibly while appreciating the resulting friction of the fabric against his skin. He then quickly surveys the room, and upon not seeing anyone with whom he would want to engage in conversation besides Luscious, makes his way to the center of the main room, where he participates in a combination of non-rhythmic body moments, perplexing gyrations, and other pendulous movements which fall somewhere on the kinetic spectrum between severe epileptic episode and postmodern dancing.

Ultimately, after a few minutes of his dance floor display, Skiouros' eyes dart around the room before he locates a vacant table in a secluded corner of the main room. He examines the blue velour upholstery of the seat before sitting down and vocalizing his thoughts.

""Sitting, the great leveler; from the mightiest Pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, everyone enjoys a good sit. In a world made unstable by the absences of the mighty, rendered powerless and dark through the quantum singularities of lycanthropic liaisons, it's best that I not leave my seat and ascend toward higher ground. Of beasts without the capacity for psychological invasion, resources are best allocated to non-linear moments of prophecy and history. Sifted in a sugary sea of dizzying manias, abysmal lethargies, and purgatory filled creamy centers. Conventional baking, I dare to abuse, but this prolonged instability does not provoke my muse.""

Skiouros continues his prolonged and increasingly indecipherable monologue, pausing occasionally to follow invisible poltergeists around the room with his eyes or to play with his diaphanous tail fabric, his mace, or his spear."

"event","Immediately after hearing the shattering of glass amidst his conversation with the Prince, Skiouros redirects his attention to the ravenous lycanthropes as they begin to devour the nearby kindred. Before reacting to the invasion, he inhales deeply and experiences an aromatic bouquet of sulfur, moist soil, and urine, the putrescence of which was reminiscent not only of the homeless man, but of the creature that had <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/kindred_haven/8811.html>attacked</a> him in the Prince's mansion. After this connection is made, Skiouros giggles to himself before observing one of the destructive beasts approaching him with astounding velocity; he attempts to evade the beast by leaping behind a large, abstract sculpture, but even with his phenomenal speed, the werewolf is successful in grabbing him. Skiouros struggles to prevent the werewolf's claws and teeth from penetrating his flesh as gravity pulls them both to the floor. The excessive animation and velocity of their conjoined movement makes the simultaneous action and surroundings appear almost frozen or static, creating the illusion that they are traveling outside of time itself. Once their interwoven mass hits the ground, Skiouros attempts to destroy the beast through total dementation, exposing the shattered fragments of his dementia filled psyche with the beast.

""This sanctuary for the concentration of the liberated kindred is sacred like the masquerade itself; like the perpetual toiling in the center of the underworld, your heresy will be punished with a damnation more insidious and eternal than death itself. The feeding grounds of unparalleled delight, the stratosphere of crimson magnificence, will not be taken away by your unprovoked carnage.""

Skiouros immediately realizes that, given the werewolf's incapacity for rational thought and primarily instinctual behavior, his attempts at dementation would be unsuccessful. As such, Skiouros successfully produces his mace and plants it into the lycanthrope's midsection, allowing him to escape its immediate grasp. Observing the massive jousting pole from behind the entrails cascading from the ceiling, pendulously rocking in the wind, he runs toward it, seeking additional camouflage from the opaque tendrils of disembodied organs which had once served only as decoration. Skiouros grabs the elongated pole and, without turning around to face the beast, thrusts the pole into its chest. The force of this impalement is sufficiently extreme not only to penetrate the werewolf's frame, but also to impale it completely; the cone shaped point of the jousting pole emerges through the lycanthrope's back. Skiouros thrusts the bloodied end of the jousting stick into a nearby wall, incapacitating the injured, yet still breathing werewolf. Skiouros walks over to the beast and intently observes it.

""Restricted in this fashion, like a boar on a rotisserie, perhaps a new realm of subcultural fast food has been discovered. Alas, dubious probability abounds that the Prince will be any more willing to adopt a Southern Colonel mystique than a flamboyant pop star persona. Powerful and overflowing with a rage hotter than a thousand suns, your potential is staggering; however, it appears as though someone else has harnessed your energy. Ah, my sulfur drenched foe, you are the manifestation of a great natural resource, but then again, linear existence has demonstrated that all great natural resources are exploited and misused.""
_____________

Skiouros hobbles over from the impaled lycanthrope toward the Prince, looking over the expansive sea of severely injured and deceased kindred. When he finally reaches the Prince's location, he observes the Prince's injuries and pauses for a moment before addressing him.

""The aromatic bouquet of sulfur, moist soil, and urine, the putrescence of which is reminiscent of the creature that attacked me in your mansion while trying to find the worm whose entrails were once the only ones that adorned the sanctuary. Alas, most of the kindred have experienced the ultimate liberation: death.""

Skiouros pauses for a moment, observing the minuscule proportion of kindred that still remain conscious, before redirecting his attention back to the Prince.

""Like an upturned cemetery, the smells and spirits of death permeate like a thick fog, obscuring our vision from the true nature of our surroundings. Perhaps we should relocate elsewhere, perhaps your purple palace?""
____________

After conversing with the Prince, Skiouros walks over to Janus with a labored hobble. In a barely audible and discreet fashion, Skiouros begins to address Janus, ensuring that any of the nearby kindred are unable to overhear the conversation.

""Are there any magical enchantments on any of these sulfur drenched beasts? With a glowing, luminescent aura like the victims of Chernobyl, it is clear that there was already unexpected and unsanctioned magic afoot.""

Skiouros pauses to gaze at the lifeless body of Lobish before giggling to himself, looking at the remaining entrails cascading from the ceiling as they delicately undulate in the wafting breezes, and returning his attention and focus to Janus.

""Like the existence of the masquerade itself, this secret will remain as clandestine and mysterious as a quantum singularity, away from the grasp of this over-conscious world deeply concealed in the hidden recesses of my liberated mind.""
____________

""Like Jamaican infomercial psychics and allegedly clairvoyant singers, kindred would likely find such proclamations to be inaccurate prophecy even if I wanted to share it.""

Skiouros giggles to himself and begins to walk toward the dense piles of corpses on the main floor. As he approaches the atrociously thrashed collections of bodies, he pauses, changes directions, and walks to an adjacent room at the greatest velocity possible given his minor injuries from the lycanthrope attack. Almost immediately after departing the main room of the sanctuary, Skiouros returns with a roll of aluminum foil and hands it to Janus, becoming briefly transfixed by its reflective quality.

""It's almost a living mirror; I had a premonition that you might be needing aluminum in the near future.""
___________

""Feel free to keep it, it's one of the more common elements.""

Skiouros returns to the main floor of the main hall and begins to poke at the various corpses on the floor with his jousting pole.

""These bodies are like supernatural gelatin, with organs suspended inside instead of the conventional marshmallows. Alas, these remains would make an adequate dessert only for cannibals, insects, and bacteria."""

"event","Skiouros bounces in his seat and quietly giggles to himself before fixing his gaze upon arbitrary points of the Conclave chamber. Ultimately, after his whimsical observations of imaginary phantoms lingering in the room's stratosphere, he focuses his attention upon the Prince.

Skiouros: ""Like the subtle nuances of irony, your regal title provokes conflicting imagery. Disappointment, lingering like the stifling heat of the desert, abounds at the absence of flamboyant purple attire and often sexually explicit popular songs riddled with synthesizers and feminine moans.""

Skiouros looks distantly into the center of the ornately decorated table and begins to bounce rhythmically back and forth, as if enjoying the musical samplings of a song only he can hear. After a few additional seconds of this nostalgic musical indulgence, he returns his attention to the Prince and continues his verbal exchange.

Skiouros: ""Like the notorious crack fiend mothers to their children, perhaps I have been negligent in my observations of my surrounding kindred. The general trend of funeral chic tends to have kindred with hair like charcoal, and not like gold. The only white male with light hair and eyes would be Izaak, and his involvement would be inconsistent with his nature. An affiliation between him and Ember would likely be undesirable to both parties, and the shreddings would splatter blood over his painfully sophisticated and linear attire. The human blood and the overwhelming need for assistance, like a divining rod toward water, lead me away from our nocturnal dwellers and toward the reservoir of humans. I question our killer's vampiric validity.""
_____________________________

Skiouros looks around the table, focusing on each of the chairs. Upon the arrival of his gaze at the Gangrel seat currently occupied by Everette, he pauses, starts to rub his temples in an attempt to concentrate, and then wildly waves his hands in front of his face, as if trying to deter outside distractions from entering his field of vision.

Skiouros: ""Our subcultural Rubik's Cube is incomplete, making this mystery difficult to solve. Donovan, fiercely independent, has failed to grace us with his presence and insights, creating darkness to our Conclave cube where there would otherwise be color. If it were not for the presence of human blood and the desperate need for integration and acceptance, my suspicions would had lead me to identify him. The disregard for the rules is obvious; Ember could be considered a sister not only because they both have the primogen equality, but there are many similarities between the Nosferatu and Gangrel inclination of shredding. Alas though, there is more evidence that a human poseur is the culprit. How would this mortal discover the clandestine secrets of our kindred, and why would this mortal have a connection to Ember?""

Skiouros stops, looks at the pile of slightly shredded police report papers and begins to laugh heartily.

Skiouros: ""All of this discussion of shredding and the presence of paper bestows upon me the desire to create more fleshless confetti.""
_______________________

Skiouros smiles, momentarily reflecting about his swashbuckling contemplations and oceanic sounds associated with the disembodied <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/kindred_haven/7663.html?thread=57327#t57327>eyeball</a>.

Skiouros: ""Since our organ adventures will not be filled with miniature eyepatches, pirate treasure, and exotic maritime ports, is there a way to locate the culprit by using the eyeball? This human, not only having knowledge of our existence, but the skills to prolong our investigation, will likely be more elusive than the typical mortal."""

"event","Skiouros, finished with his reflections on the underrated greatness of <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/kindred_haven/6586.html>sitting</a> or the political fluidity of English Muffins, focuses his attention on Everette and begins to giggle festively before addressing him.

Skiouros: ""Ah, Gangrel Kitty, blessed with the esoteric splendors of the tail and the character not to succumb to the mundane style of funeral chic. Having just arrived, her departure would be unfortunate and surprising; she may be feral and untamed like the majestic felines of the savannah, but I doubt she is a nomad. Arboreal, like those mystical, two-dimensional cookie making elves, perhaps. This city has neglected its urban forest, for the air smells of pine only when enhanced with an automobile freshener.""

Skiouros pauses for a moment, enthusiastically sniffs the surrounding air, and sighs before continuing his vocalizations.

Skiouros: ""Alas, this atmosphere is laden only with the aroma of stagnant death, sexual expectation, and sugary lubricant. Having failed to satiate her hunger with the mathematically shaped blood orange and catnip confectionery creation, to the collection of abandoned ones at the orphanage we went. Eager to overindulge at her peril like the gluttonous monarchs of oppressive empires, my interference prevented her from breaking the Prince's mandates. Being filled with propriety, she had intentions of bringing a gift to the Prince himself, despite the woeful deficiency of assless purple velvet pants and a repertoire of catchy pop songs. The decade of decadence, what memorable times. The Egyptians of ancient times worshiped the feline, and I had hoped Scorn might be receptive to Luscious in her Cleopatra attire. Congruent with more recent celebrities for those grounded to a linear existence, perhaps I should had gone with the Jamaican television psychic Miss Cleo instead.""

Skiouros begins to giggle to himself again before climbing on the table and rolling around on it with exuberant jubilation and complete indifference to the severity of the discussion. Rolling around with a sporadic rhythm asynchronous to the background music and serpentine undulations which provocatively combine flexibility, epilepsy, and a severe disregard for chiropractic dogma, he uses various pieces of his diaphanous tail fabric to replicate a veil before pausing, gazing at arbitrary areas of the room, and calmly returning to his seat.
_____________________________

Skiouros, perplexed by the uncharacteristic lack of focus exhibited by Everette, follows the path of his gaze with his own eyes, leading his sight to Luscious. He giggles quietly, rapidly rolls his eyes, and addresses Luscious from across the room.

Skiouros: ""The gravity of your precious fluids has a pull stronger than that of most celestial bodies this evening; your circulatory system is pumping interference. Return to the sanctuary and fulfill another fetishist's fantasy -- perhaps the feline one along the vein of this evening's discussion.""

Luscious: ""Whatevah, I'm tired of wearing this ridiculous costume anyway. Me and my asp are going home. The feline one? Fine, I'll take off all these crazy clothes, put on a bra and pair of leather hot pants, slink around like a cat on the floor, and drink from a bowl of milk while 'Me So Horny' plays in the background.""

Luscious, irritated by the spectacle of the evening and eager to leave, forcefully and directly exits Blood Haven. Skiouros chuckles loudly, bounces in his chair, and briefly mumbles to himself before returning his attention to Everette.

Skiouros: ""So many questions, the floodgates have failed under the enormous pressure of curiosity's reservoir. Linguistics, like a pool of molasses, filled with sticky situations and deadly misunderstandings. The concentration of abandoned ones, the orphanage, was a feeding, not a murder. To violate the Prince's mandates would be more deadly than exposing the kindred's flesh to sunlight. Mesmerized by her tailed splendor, I encountered Scorn here recently; she is new, fresh, and compelling, like the seedlings that take root after a forest has been set ablaze. Alas, I have no experience of the Conclave shreddings, only what has been told by the investigation team. Scorn being involved seems too obvious, devoid of the subtext our brethren so eloquently, eagerly, and frequently provide.""
______________________________

Skiouros glances at the severely thrashed manila folder and enthusiastically chuckles at its current condition.

Skiouros: ""Deconstructed, and slightly shredded, organic like the unlimited labyrinth of the mind, I see that you alone were not the only entity to have a brief and intimate relationship with Scorn's claws. She may be a mysterious new friend, but it is unlikely she befriends many with such ease.""

Skiouros looks at the torn manila folder again, intently staring at it with a concentrated, almost mesmerized focus before returning his gaze to Everette.

Skiouros: ""Shredding, the opposite of the negative shreddings of the Conclave meeting; perhaps we can shred these papers and make some carnage confetti? Weeeee! It's time for a party.""
______________________________

Somewhat oblivious to the multitude of conversations and perpetually increasing awkward tensions, Skiouros frantically looks to arbitrary points of the room before returning his gaze to the eyeball still on the table. While bouncing nervously in his seat and twitching slightly, he collects the eyeball from the table, holds it directly up to one of his eyes, and giggles nervously.

Skiouros: ""Like the panopticon, omnipresent and watchful without the ability for us to watch, this optical organ is unsettling. It emanates sensations of paranoia, as if still watching us through a microprocessor or mystical force.""

Skiouros briefly glances over at Everette, taking his attention away from the disembodied eyeball.

Skiouros: ""Like the unseen forces of the moon on the oceans, are there any magical enchantments on this amazingly fresh organ? Perhaps I can find half a pair of sunglasses, or even better, an eyepatch. Yes, an eyepatch, complete with a miniature parrot replica comprised of an eye socket bone, a pirate flag of human skin, and a peg leg of fibrous tissue. Our optical organ evenings can be filled with swashbuckling adventures of exotic ports, bountiful booty, and the occasional bout of scurvy. Aargh!""

Skiouros begins to laugh to himself hysterically, occasionally interrupted by his generation of barely audible oceanic sounds like waves hitting the beach or the distant communication of seagulls.

Skiouros grabs the paper, affectionately holds it to his chest, enthusiastically squeals with delight, and giggles before tearing the paper into small pieces and festively throwing it in the air.

Skiouros: ""If only I had a mathematically shaped confection to complete this impromptu celebrations."""

"event","Skiouros enthusiastically opens the imposing doors to Blood Haven and whimsically frolics inside in a motion which seems to incorporate rhythmic dance moves, nervous twitching, and general dementia. Having experienced a recent temporal episode in which those seen adorned themselves in brightly colored garland, his already eccentric wardrobe has been enhanced with long, decadent strands of fluorescent garland integrated into his tail fabric. Not to neglect prominent fashion statements of ancient civilizations, he has also enhanced his outfit with a belt constructed of bones for that caveman chic look.

Luscious enters immediately behind him, reluctantly costumed as Cleopatra; the uncomfortable expression on her face is a clear indication that although she may had been earlier convinced to wear such an outrageous outfit, her mind was quickly changing. After a brief survey of the room, Luscious looks over to Skiouros to ask him a question.

Luscious: ""Now why I am wearing this ridiculous costume again? You know, if I weren't your retainer, I'd slap you until my hand hurts, then slap you for making my hand hurt.""

Skiouros violently chuckles with highly vocal, wild abandonment, occasionally falling to his knees from the overwhelming nature of his amusement until regaining his composure and addressing Luscious.

Skiouros: ""There exists a sense of bonding and cohesion through our shared homage to ancient attire. The Egyptians of ancient times worshiped the feline, and perhaps Scorn might be receptive to you if she is perhaps present tonight; the reunion of tailed kindred is an event to encourage and celebrate.""

Skiouros briefly searches arbitrary points of the room while intermittently focusing his gaze upon either the shiny garland or the reflections emanating from his wrist armor. After a moment of illuminary entrancement, Skiouros notices Izaak and Sasha pressed closely against each other, gyrating in hedonistic unison. Intrigued by the meeting of two Primogen outside of a Conclave meeting, Skiouros scurries over to their location in the plush corner of the club.

Skiouros: ""Unlike the recent meeting at the Prince tragically devoid of assless purple velvet pants and a repertoire of catchy pop songs, there is no dessert to excuse my imposition. Have you joined together to discuss the recent mortal shreddings and the kindred violations? Shreddings should be reserved for sensitive documents; I enjoy an impromptu parade filled with streaming bunches of sensitive document confetti. Many years ago, after a feeding, I contemplated a way, efficient like German sex, to dispose of the lifeless remains. This person, covered in sensitive skin, seemed like the prime candidate for the paper shredder, as the shredder was accustomed to the consumption of sensitive entities like confidential documents. The arm was placed through the eager blades, and his remaining fluids splattered throughout the room; Pollock likely cringed with envy at such innovation from the supernatural realms. After that, the paper shredder always had a perplexing and distinct aroma of hand lotion and expired luncheon meat. It seems like centuries have passed since our brethren had an official parade.""

Skiouros ceases his tangential ramblings and shifts his gaze around to the corners of the room, occasionally fondling random pieces of his tail fabric and quietly giggling.

Skiouros: ""Crazy is nothing more than a misunderstanding for liberated. Underrated are the pleasures of sitting, the great leveler; from the mightiest Pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?""

Skiouros enthusiastically giggles and bounces in his seat, focusing his gaze upon Everette as he arrives and sits in a rather frazzled manner.

Skiouros giggles quietly upon hearing Ember's words before delicately bouncing in his seat and responding.

Skiouros: ""Freedom, like the fruity splendor of quadrilateral candies, is a word bursting with multiple, potent flavors. Perhaps when the government, eager to transfer its guilt to other nations, will further defile this bountiful word by adding Freedom Muffins to the political menu of Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast?"""

"event","After a prolonged period of uneventful entrancement from the various tailed creatures seen during his <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/6167.html>park</a> <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/6167.html>adventures</a>, Skiouros regains his focus and continues his travels back to the Malkavian sanctuary, oscillating his movements between whimsical skipping and haphazard scurrying on his hands and knees. The bright illumination of the moon, combined with the harsh radiance of fluorescent street lamps, cast fascinating and amorphous shadows on the otherwise sterile concrete of the sidewalk. Skiouros stops his carefree frolicking through the labyrinth of urban pathways and gazes down upon the ground, devoting significant concentration to the patterns of shadows undergoing their perpetual metamorphosis. 

Skiouros: ""Like the constant transformation of a lava lamp or the incessant rippling of cellulite attached to the obese in motion, these phantoms of the light are mesmerizing. Inferior are the creatures found in clouds, as they are stagnant with consistency; this one looks like a unicorn swimming in a lake of gelatin.""

Skiouros begins to giggle at the realization that he has been conversing with himself. As such, he fondles a few stray pieces of tail fabric, quickly admires the reflective nature of his wrist armor, shakes and bounces with nervous energy, and forfeits his shadow appreciation in place of returning back to the sanctuary before the sun rises. He effortlessly navigates the narrow, disorienting corridors as would a mouse that has been subjected to the same maze experiment for its entire life.

Skiouros arrives at the entrance to the great consolidation of liberated kindred, the Malkavian sanctuary. He glances toward the nearby orphanage where he had recently experienced his juvenile feeding engagement with <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/4950.html>Scorn</a>, one of the few kindred equally blessed with the splendors of a tail, noticing that the ineffective single-pane window still had not been repaired. From the pungent aroma of urine and pine trees, combined with a distant echo of hysterical laughter, Skiouros realizes that the recently demented homeless man is still loitering outside the premises, unintentionally serving as a beacon for the depressed and destitute while simultaneously repelling mortals and kindred alike with pretentious or delicate sensibilities. Skiouros follows the sound of laughter around the corner, coming in contact with the homeless man currently laying on the ground amidst a pile of his clothes saturated with urine. 

Skiouros: ""Nothing is more indicative of the rapture of insanity and liberation than the uncommon fragrance of artifical coniferous trees and excessive urination; delight abounds in your decency of keeping the car freshner around your neck. However, what is this other object that you grasp?""

Upon closer examination, Skiouros notices that tightly grasped in his left hand is Morag's Claymore. He zealously removes the Claymore from his grip, lifts the homeless man from the ground, carries him to the entrance, and throws him through the door, making a festive sound as he gracefully flies through the main room of the asylum.

Skiouros: ""Weeeeee! Roller coaster rides are best without a track. After my altruistic act of liberating you from your residential alienation, financial condemnation, and malodorous emanations, you betray my graciousness with this egregious act. Alas, you will now be subjected to a fury which burns hotter than a thousand suns.""

Skiouros calls for Morag, playfully dangling the Claymore in his hands while looking at arbitrary corners of the room and following imaginary poltergeists with his eyes as if gazing through the ceiling itself and toward the stratosphere."

"event","Skiouros departs from the Malkavian sanctuary with a sense of sedulousness which although quite desperate, definitely is not serious. As such, he produces a piece of sheer fabric and wears it as a veil while rolling around on the floor in the style of Madonna mumbling to himself and laughing hysterically before composing himself and commences his journey. Motivated by his current goal to assist Morag in locating her missing <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/5512.html>Claymore</a> both to mitigate the suffering of his fellow kindred and to prevent any further creative redecorating of the asylum, he bursts through the door and begins to giggle festively, skipping down the darkened corridors with joyous frivolity, inattentively swinging his mace at his side. He frolics and scurries with considerable velocity toward the Blood Haven in hopes that there will be evidence of the Claymore itself or that another vampire will have some information. During his travels, he passes by a costume shop where a suit of armor is featured, complete with a conical jousting pole. Upon gazing at this establishment, he stops his momentum and looks through the window while talking to himself.

Skiouros: ""The ideal companion to my mace, reflective with the retroactive sensation of medieval feudalism. As the other Malkavian vassals report to their liege like the times of castles and lords, the primogen should possess such a manifestation. Perhaps a double order is in order if the Claymore does not surface; however, the preference points toward something more easily concealed.""

With this brief weaponry diversion, Skiouros continues his quest toward the Blood Haven, walking at a calmer pace, intermittently following shadows and reflections with his eyes as they undergo their perpetual metamorphoses by the changing of light sources and the blowing of branches in the wind. Suddenly, and without external provocation, he stops his movement and simply stands in his current location, seemingly paralyzed.

<i>The trees in the park are unusually saturated in their color, accentuated by an uncanny iridescence of the leaves as though they had been coated in refractive glitter. Either this park had been abandoned by the neighborhood citizens many years ago, or the spiders in the region were unusually active, as spiderwebs are haphazardly strewn throughout the walkways and the branches. Approaching the park closer, Skiouros notices a brisk aroma in the air, as if it had just rained, magnifying the smell of the wet soil and newly budding foliage. Gazing into the center of the densely forested park, there is something small, metallic, and elusive.</i>

A fairly strong gust of wind blows the accumulation of tail fabric against his skin, interrupting his paralyzing episode and bringing him back to his more tangible environment. Upon the realization of his physical location, he turns around and heads back toward the Malkavian sanctuary. On his way back, he gazes to his left to see both a peacock and a squirrel running around in a park. 

Skiouros: ""Such ornately tailed creatures truly are gifts of unparalleled transcendence and rapture.""

Skiouros, transfixed and by these mesmerizing animals, stands there mesmerized, giggling to himself as his gaze follows these creatures as they playfully interact with his field of vision."

"event","Skiouros, after his immensely satisfying interaction with Scorn at the nearby <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/4950.html>orphanage</a>, enters the Malkavian sanctuary with Luscious as he giggles to himself and bounces with the usual nervous energy. Noticing that the room is not illuminated at all, he attempts to turn on the lights as he fixes his gaze upon arbitrary points of the room. Upon realization of the electrical failure, he lights a candle; Morag, although partially obscured by the inconsistent light emanating from the candle, is visible as she pants heavily in the center of the room amidst the destruction she had just created. 

Skiouros: ""Morag, of hair aflame like your unrestrained passions, clearly something afflicts you as if your blood has been heated to a boil.""

Skiouros joyously frolics over to one of the walls which has been made inconsistent with holes likely caused by Morag's fist. He begins mumbling incoherently and quietly to himself before sticking his head through the hole in the wall. He pauses, looking at the interior of the adjacent room, before  enthusiastically bleating like a goat and replicating its horns with his fingers. After a brief period of  this perplexing agricultural entertainment, Skiouros removes his head from the architectural absence to focus on Morag.

Skiouros: ""What is the nature of this feng shui carnage of offended chi? Like the exposure of the kindred to sunlight, nobody would dare to desecrate the sanctity of the asylum, lest they willingly invite the liberation of the mind and the Prince's wrath.""

Luscious: ""Did you just wake up and decide you hated everything?""

Skiouros consistently stares at Morag with great concern, interrupted only by the occasional glance around the room, following imaginary phantoms with his eyes while fondling random pieces of his tail fabric.
________________

Skiouros: ""Truly the theft of such a sacred object deserves such rage; your fire should burn hotter than that of a million suns once the culprit is discovered.""

Skiouros pauses for a moment and looks around the room at various objects and corners before giggling to himself and returning to the subject of Morag's Claymore.

Skiouros: ""The voices of the kindred have not told me of its location, nor have the internal voices which spread throughout time. Perhaps it is ideal for you to trace your movements from the discovery of its absence; meanwhile, I will see if the voice of Prophet or the others will lead me to it. The Malkavian boat will stay afloat despite even the most diabolical attempts to capsize it.""

Skiouros looks at the hole in the wall where he had just bleated like a goat and begins giggling to himself again.

Skiouros: ""Perhaps the resulting interior carnage has a hidden benefit; I believe the bleating hole will remain after the mystery has been demystified.""
_________________

Skiouros: ""Like the starvation of human females in an attempt to emulate the image of their fashion paper counterparts, your apologies are unnecessary. The emotional chasm of despair grows as you remain separated from the Claymore, and without a bridge to traverse the abyss and a destination to direct your rage, it is bound to escape at those unintended.""

Skiouros looks about the walls of the sanctuary for a moment before scurrying about the premises, searching for Prophet to see if she has any knowledge as to the location of the Claymore. After a brief period of frolicking about the sanctuary while nervously bouncing and quietly conversing with himself, he returns to the initial room with Morag.

Skiouros: ""If Prophet is herein contained, she is well concealed like shadows within the darkness. Alas, it is difficult to interrogate one who is absent, and thus we must wait to see if she can provide the key to unlock the mystery.""

Skiouros begins to hum the theme song from the ""Jeopardy"" game show while following invisible phantoms about the room before ceasing his musical endeavors and yelling at the ceiling.

Skiouros: ""Curse you Trebek and your musical interludes! What a delight it would be to liberate your mind from the tediousness of being grounded with reality and the mundane obligations of sanity; your quiz show legacy would be exponentially improved. If you resist, I would remove your condescending mustache from your lip and sacrifice it to the follicle gods in a fiery, hedonistic ritual akin to those of tribal lore.""

Luscious looks over at Skiouros, interrupting his popular culture diatribe as she taps him on the shoulder.

Luscious: ""I think he lost the mustache years ago. Good thing too, they always get in the way.""

Skiouros: ""Ah, then the source should be sacrificed, the entire upper lip will be substituted.""

Skiouros closes his eyes and vigorously shakes his head before enthusiastically giggling to himself, opening his eyes, and returning his gaze upon Morag.

Skiouros: ""The cohesive threads which bind together the many tangents eager to disperse and distract must be loose. If someone violated the holiness of the sanctuary, this person must be chastised. If it were taken, perhaps it was discarded, as this society believes itself to be disposable. I will venture to look nearby and see if I can discover it or anyone that might provide enlightenment. Unless you are alternatively inclined, you may want to continue searching inside or outside in the surrounding area."""

"event","Skiouros grabs <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/3703.html>Scorn</a> by the hand and, with great vigor and jubilation, thrusts the intricately carved Blood Haven doors open and scurries outside. He chuckles and squeals with unbridled delight as he prances upon the sterile concrete of the deserted sidewalk. The excessive animation and velocity of their conjoined movement contrasted with their static, almost frozen surroundings creates the illusion that they are traveling outside of time itself. Skiouros gazes back at Scorn and releases a giggle reminiscent of the quintessential shy Japanese schoolgirl; Scorn, in addition to a faint detection of ravenous hunger concealed behind her eyes, appears moderately entertained by the experience.

Skiouros: ""Windswept, like the iconoclastic models of unattainable beauty, our momentum is accentuating the seductive anticipation before the feast. Our tails, interwoven from our frenzied movement, have become omens to those they represent. Soon, slightly past the concentration of the liberated kindred and the man of coniferous aroma, awaits the feeding grounds of unparalleled delight, the stratosphere of crimson magnificence.""

Skiouros and Scorn turn down a darkened corridor and pass the Malkavian sanctuary where the demented homeless man still stands, laughing hysterically and smelling of urine and pine trees. Approximately two buildings past the sanctuary, Skiouros abruptly stops his movement, bounces enthusiastically, becomes briefly distracted by his shiny wrist armor, and focuses his attention on Scorn, pendulously switching his gaze between her eyes and her tail. 

Skiouros: ""Prophet, the liberated kindred comforted by the perpetual embrace of multiple arms, was surveying the window of television when I was distracted by the imposing blond begging to feed the children. Magnetized like the mosquito to the ear, feelings of elation came over me as the discovery was made that I could feed on the children and be humanitarian. Curse you colon and the woes of this social contract called language; it was only later that I realized that it was feed the children, and not 'feed<b>:</b> the children.' Years of suffering and torment felt by these underdeveloped mortals from abandonment slowly washed away the facets of happiness, like glass smoothed by the constant attrition of the sea. Demented, many were made through my powers, to liberate them from their demise of conscious suffering. When the children would disappear, there was nobody for the reclamation, for there was nobody to whom they were entangled, lest the state be a being.""

Skiouros points to the building in their direct vision, specifically highlighting a sign which reads 'Greater New York Orphanage.' The building is rather mundane in its architectural style, resembling what appears to be a concrete box. Painted light blue in the attempts to create a calming aura, it appears to radiate its own light source as the surrounding lights bounce off the glossy paint. As such, it seems like a beacon amidst the other buildings obscured by the encompassing darkness. There is a small playground on the property outside of the building where currently, a small child sits, crying to herself as she sits motionless on a swing. Skiouros then smiles intensely as he plays with his tail fabric and sporadically pets Scorn."

"event","Skiouros, frolicking and skipping down the ornately decorated hallway with an uninhibited childlike abandonment, encounters his retainer Luscious waiting impatiently in the lobby, and follows her outside the Prince's chambers. Satisfied with his personal <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/skiouros/904.html>contributions</a> to the most recent <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/1001.html>Conclave</a> meeting, he begins to giggle in a maniacal, yet quiet fashion. As Skiouros and Luscious continue to travel the vacant streets made eerily luminescent by the intense illumination of the full moon, Skiouros' steps take on a whimsical quality as he practically bounces each time his foot comes into contact with the concrete. Luscious looks over at Skiouros, who appears to be transfixed on some indecipherable and possibly imaginary object in the distant horizon, and begins to speak.

Luscious: ""So, what happened at the Conclave meeting? The Prince doesn't just call these things for no reason.""

Skiouros, without making eye contact with her, responds at first with a giggle, and then an extended period of silence before speaking at his typical frenzied pace.

Skiouros: ""The Prince, comparable to the majestic empires of antiquity, significant and worthy of eternal fame throughout the ages; however, much like the empires, the collapse can only be delayed and not avoided. It appears as though the end of his reign would create euphoria, and not misery. Constant disappointment abounds because his reign is not like purple rain; Prince is the pinnacle of greatness when expressed as a flamboyant musician with a penchant for wearing purple. Regardless, having been the Prince for so many years, he must know what it sounds like when doves cry, the suffering of innocence and the corruption of purity. The dove is nothing more than the albino pigeon; what an undeserved elevation that symbolism and lore can bestow.""

Luscious: ""Whatevah, you say that every time, and I don't think it's going to change. Hey, remember that guy I dated that looked like Prince when we first moved to New York? I saw him the other day, and he's gotten faaaaaat! I still remember the day, for our anniversary, he rented that posh hotel room, and when I got there, I saw a case of cheap ass malt liquor on the bed, and I'm like to myself, 'Hell no, I'm not drinking that. You better get me some champagne.' I mean, I'm not a broke ho -- I have expensive tastes. Look at me, I've got six ankle chains around my waist. It was my mission to get my sip on, and all he could do was look at me and hand me the case of Saint Ives. Then I was like, 'I already told you, I don't drink Saint Ives, and you better recognize.' He never did, and so I walked out, for good.""

Skiouros, unaffected or oblivious to her petty recollections, continues with his retelling of the Conclave attendees. 

Skiouros: ""Ember, the kindred without a face, but hands pointy like the plastic couple from a wedding cake, was accused of shredding the flesh. There is a danger of exposing the kindred like an undeveloped photograph to light, resulting in agonizing nothingness, its negative, its more comforting companion. The immaculate but touchable one is leading a team to investigate. The Gangrel Primogen was not there to give the mathematically shaped pie to the Gangrel Kitty from our <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/547.html>meeting</a> at the club. There was a note in it so we could meet again at the Blood Haven, but if the note she does receive, I can resist the temptation to grieve.""

Skiouros and Luscious arrive outside the entrance to the Malkavian sanctuary. To their surprise, there is a destitute, homeless man begging for change. The homeless man, violently shaking from what appears to be the inability to control his movements, grabs a small cup and lifts it toward them. Skiouros looks at the impoverished man as his eyes travel across the totality of his malnourished, emaciated frame. Skiouros then intensely stares into the man's vacant, clouded eyes, approaching the man more closely as if to assist in penetrating the man's soul. The homeless man begins to chuckle, and then laugh hysterically. This laughter continues until the hilarity becomes so overwhelming and intoxicating that he loses bladder continence and urinates on himself. 

Skiouros: ""If I am unable to change your residential condition, at least I can change your daily disposition.""

Skiouros and Luscious enter the Malkavian sanctuary as the freshly soiled man continues to experience his inexplicable jubilation and dementia outside in the darkened corridors. Skiouros rapidly looks around the initial room of the sanctuary, devoting slightly more time to the corners of the room that intersect the ceiling and any other places of geometric interest. Hearing the incessant changing of channels emanating from the Sitting Room, he scurries throughout the other rooms of the sanctuary without paying attention to their condition and approaches the Sitting Room to discover Prophet standing on the highly scuffed coffee table of questionable structural integrity. Entertained by Prophet's rapid shuffling of channels on the television and intrigued by the ecstasy derived from it, Skiouros enthusiastically jumps on the coffee table and begins to move about in a fashion which combines minor epileptic seizure, seductive pelvic gyrations, and the occasional kinetic display which faintly resembles a recognizable dance move. He then looks at Prophet, smiles, and begins to speak to her.

Skiouros: ""Prophet, the Tail has returned, and because your comfort and happiness I desire to enhance, I have a present for you.""

Skiouros then reaches behind him and searches through the accumulation of tail fabric, becoming intermittently mesmerized by the reflections caused by his shiny wrist armor. Ultimately, he produces a large remote control about two feet in length, adorned with fluorescent, brightly glowing buttons. He then hands the remote to Prophet as he points to a corner of the room where a massive television with an enormous screen has been installed. 

Skiouros: ""Even Napoleon, who started small, was ultimately able to conquer vast lands. The people on the screen are the same size as the people outside, but unlike the flesh outside the sanctuary, you have control over the television people. Your increased power may help you acclimate to when nocturnal departure is prudent.""

Skiouros then randomly gazes around the room, moving his hands about in abstract patterns and laughing at the distortion his hands cause as he places them in front of his line of vision. He then focuses his attention on the couch where Morag has been sitting, ominously and destructively interacting with her dagger. Enchanted by the unexpected presence of Morag, he gleefully jumps from the coffee table and approaches her, staring at the incision on her hand as he speaks.

Skiouros: ""Morag, like an eclipse or the Harvest Moon, rarely seen and frequently treasured. Usually absent like light escaping from a quantum singularity, I am pleased that you are in the sanctuary, transcending the excrement of your kindred displeasure and blossoming like the transcendent lotus. Surely your intuition informs you of the foreboding events that have transpired.""

Skiouros, formerly focused on Morag's incision, now begins to look about the room randomly, as if addressing the entire room in general rather than the specific people contained within it.

Skiouros: ""It is said that this city is an apple; however, the apple has been spoiled by a worm. Three people, marked like they were perpetually unclean with the affliction of a guilty conscience of a Shakespearean lady, were scratched until disfigurement. Alas, this was not an internal itch, but rather an external itch of oppression, like Prophet maybe once suffered in the clinic. If only the itch were internal, then the suicide would not expose the kindred and its order. Flesh authorities, institutions of ideologies used to subjugate the masses, have knowledge of their demise, otherwise their movements could be fabricated into an imitation of life once I had a Hawaiian shirt and a vacation spot. Oh, the foretelling of abysmal cinema! Although I have an itch of curiosity for truth, and Morag has a desire for the pangs of war, the Prince has mandated, and the investigation is without Malkavian. Perpetual war for perpetual peace is a worrisome policy, but hopefully the karmic forces will forgive any conflict and maintain the peace, unlike fornication for virginity.""

Skiouros then begins to replicate the motion of deliberate and intense self-scratching without actually touching himself in a fashion similar to that of the Conclave meeting. His movements become more chaotic and animated until he suddenly stops all movement together, indicative of another episode of temporal paralysis.

<i>Skiouros is temporarily blinded by the intense illumination of artificial light originating from the overhead halogen lamps of the midway. Once his eyes are able to distinguish objects in his environment, he notices a large Ferris wheel in front of him and the distant sounds of carnival music and children laughing. Walking around the mysterious terrain, he notices there is a picturesque, ancient oak tree with a heavily textured trunk and intertwined branches on a hill in the distance. The newly formed tendrils of this tree are ablaze with a fire which is so hot, it burns blue at the base of the flame and slowly fades to the more common reds and oranges as the flame's length increases. Next to the tree there is a woman making cotton candy and placing it in front of the eyes of the carnival spectators, obscuring their sight so that they fail to notice the flaming oak. The surroundings then become completely dark, as if in a void.</i>

Skiouros then realizes that he is back in the Malkavian sanctuary. He looks over at Luscious, who glances down at her watch.

Luscious: ""Don't worry, it was only seven seconds that time.""

Perplexed by the imagery of his temporal episode or hallucination, Skiouros walks over to the couch and sits down to reflect about any possible meaning behind the symbols."

Skiouros simply stares at Luscious, instructing her to remain in the lobby while he prepares to enter the conclave chambers. Luscious looks around the waiting area, noticing that there is already someone else in the room likely given a similar command. She appears somewhat uncomfortable as she peruses the ornate interior, deciding to say something just to distract herself from the ominous tension.</i>

Luscious: ""Whatevah, I do what I want!"" 

<i>Skiouros continues to proceed down the elegant hallway with immense vigor and energy with both boxes still in hand. He enters through the ornate doorway and places both of the boxes on the table in front of his chair. Producing a small red pen from amidst the accumulation of various tail fabric, he writes ""For the cat"" on one of the boxes and places the box in front of the currently vacant Gangrel chair in response to an earlier <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/community/kindred_haven/547.html>interaction</a> in the club. He then takes the other box and places it in front of the Prince, opening it to reveal a cherry pie in the shape of the mathematical concept pi. Immediately after showing the contents of the box, he glances at the Prince for a moment with a slightly crazed and expressive glare before bowing slightly before him. He then, at a moderately frantic pace, begins to speak.</i>

Skiouros: ""Conventional baking, I dare to abuse; desserts in esoteric shapes provoke my muse. You seem exhausted, but satisfied at the same time, like the euphoric sensation of drowning victims before the final fragments of life escape them.""

<i>He then walks around the table to his designated chair, standing behind it, frequently looking around the room, often at the corners where the cathedral walls intersect with the massive vaulted ceilings while effervescently bouncing in place. While waiting for the others to arrive, he occasionally fondles the accumulation of fabric replicating a tail or becomes entranced by the shiny nature of his copper colored wrist armor. Amidst the anticipation, he notices Janus and his elegant cloak.</i>

Skiouros: ""Updrafts and cloaks are the best combination. You would be loved by all, like that iconic blond cinema actress; the cloak should be diaphanous, or shredded, or maybe both.""

He then looks as his hands and waves them in front of his face as though they are making hallucinogenic trails. After doing this for a few seconds, he looks over to Ember and, while focusing on her claws, begins to speak.</i>

"event","<b>Character Background</b>

<i><b>Pre-Embrace</i></b>: Skiouros Kabar was born on November 21, 1950 in a small village on the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean. The night of his birth was unusual in terms of astronomy, since the moon was in its earliest waxing stage and thus was hardly a sliver in the sky. This, combined with an intense storm whose clouds dominated the otherwise exposed heavens, obscured all natural light which would had normally been seen after dark. Furthermore, the storm had eliminated any electricity, thereby providing no escape from the darkness which engulfed the entire community; as such, there was not even enough light for a shadow to be cast. Despite the confusion of the storm and the minimal visibility, the labor was free of any complications, with the exception of one. Upon feeling Skiouros' back, there appeared to be a slight protrusion near his lower back. It was later discovered that this was simply an extra calcification of bone matter, which is sometimes referred to as a tail. It is for these reasons that he received the name Skiouros, which is a combination of <i>ski</i>, which in archaic Greek means <i>shadow</i>, and <i>ouros</i>, meaning <i>tail</i>. For purposes of simplicity, Skiouros' name was often shortened to either ""Ski"" for the people on the island that spoke Greek, or ""Shadow"" for the English speaking inhabitants. Since his tail was not readily visible, it was rarely mentioned.

Skiouros' parents were, like many people in the village, monetarily poor but land wealthy. His parents had converted one of the smaller cottages on their property into a quaint inn to secure income during the tourist season. His mother, whose ancestors had lived on the island for as far back as their genealogy could be traced, tended primarily to the tourists, while his father, a swarthy recent Tunisian immigrant from Carthage, focused on the finances. As a child, he enjoyed conversing with the endless cycles of tourists, delighting them with his complex and intricately developed imagination, even if he thought it was more an influence of outside forces rather than just an imagination. 

When he was 10 years of age, in December of 1960, Cyprus transformed from an occupied territory of the United Kingdom to an independent nation-state. This political transition was primarily a bureaucratic process relatively free of violence or uprising... relatively free. His village had been accused of concealing criminals who performed acts of vandalism and civil disobedience prior to the transition. As a result, the occupying forces decided to raid the village, murdering most of the residents. Although he was able to flee the village with the aid of other villagers, he was informed that both his parents had been killed as a result of being a threat to domestic security. Fortunately, he was not completely abandoned, as his mother had a twin sister who lived in Berkeley, California. 

Berkeley during the 1960s was a place of social liberation, experimentation, and controlled upheaval. His Aunt Laura was the stereotypical hippie with her beaded dresses, hemp sandals, long hair, lingering aroma of marijuana and wet dirt, and an inclination to partake of many psychotropic drugs. She lived in a large house filled with extravagant expenditures; however, the origins of her wealth were at first a mystery, since she never appeared to have a job. Unfortunately, this revelation was accompanied with some rather pernicious consequences. Around the age of 14, Skiouros was asked by his Aunt if he could help her with her work. Whereas this request seemed innocent enough, he graciously complied with her request. They drove from Berkeley to Oakland, ultimately stopping in a parking lot near a primarily industrial and commercial part of the city. After a short walk to an inconspicuous warehouse, the nature of his Aunt's money was revealed: her wealth had been amassed from years of prostitution as well as a more recent venture into the exploitation of other sex workers as a pimp. The clients seemed primarily to be overweight, middle-aged men desperate to find someone who would touch them without being repulsed, even if under insincere pretenses. How was Skiouros to help in this commercialization of sex? Although his Aunt had many female workers, there were few male workers. Then again, there weren't any female clients. Therefore, he was occasionally used to satisfy the clients that had a craving for younger boys and the pocketbook to fund such social vices. Additionally, there was a particular client that would pay outrageous amounts of money to witness incestuous sexual acts. As a result, Skiouros and his Aunt would occasionally engage in carnal acts under the auspices of financial security. This occurred from the age of 14 until the age of 18, at which time Skiouros left for college.

Skiouros' desire to leave behind the objectification of the skin trade motivated him to excel in his academic studies. He received excellent marks in all of his classes, and was situated to be accepted into college without any difficulties. During his high school career, he occasionally experienced visions which he believed were images or situations from different periods of time. Although most of the visions were too esoteric and indecipherable to be translated into prophecy, they did occasionally impart some form of knowledge of understanding. As a result, Skiouros came to believe that there is a mystical thread through which time and all experiences are interconnected, and when given the proper blessing or comprehension, the barriers which limit individuals to experience life only in a temporally linear fashion can be subverted. At the time, these temporal transgressions were minimal and non-disruptive.

Skiouros left Berkeley to go to college at University of California, Santa Cruz. On his way to Santa Cruz, he stopped by the warehouse in Oakland which still housed his Aunt's concubines. There was a tall, slender girl with skin as black as charcoal and eyes as green as emeralds. She was 15 years old at the time, and had been abandoned by her birth parents as a baby. Skiouros' Aunt had found her as an infant and trained her from birth to be a sex worker, starting with giving her the name Luscious. Whereas teeth were more of a liability than an asset to some prostitutes, Luscious was never given any toothpaste and thus, she had already lost all of her teeth. Feeling an unusual amount of sympathy, Skiouros took Luscious from the warehouse and had her move with him to Santa Cruz. Their relationship was never sexual, but did have a master/servant dynamic out of appreciation and gratitude.

Fascinated with the study of time as a result of his temporal lapses, Skiouros decided to study physics, primarily focusing on quantum physics. Like in high school, he excelled in college as well, acquiring his doctorate at the age of 26. During this time period, the temporal lapses increased in frequency, usually showing him bizarre images of what appeared to be the future, or the times of extreme antiquity. Although these episodes appeared to only occur to the outside viewer for seconds, they did lead to a complete paralysis during that time period. He sought medical advice from a few different doctors; however, they could only attribute it to ""conscious narcolepsy"" or ""lucid dreaming"" and provided no solution. After receiving his doctorate, he was offered a research job in New York City, where he moved into a former warehouse that had previously been converted into a loft and studio for a rather eccentric artist along with Luscious, who had become his chauffeur, bodyguard, secretary, maid, and general personal assistant.

<b><i>Embrace And Post-Embrace</b></i>: Two years after moving to New York City, Skiouros, at the age of 28, was immensely enjoying the vibrance and eclectic nature of the city. The beginnings of punk and new wave were approaching, and the New York nightlife and underground scenes proved to be quite exciting. Since his research position was fairly flexible and did not involve much interaction with the general public, he could make his own hours and look however he wanted. One night, after dancing at a club until sunrise, hedonistically gyrating and participating in various sordid acts of debauchery, he returned to the loft to find his Aunt Laura already inside. Skiouros was definitely surprised to see her, since he had not communicated with her after leaving for college almost ten years earlier. She had aged exceptionally well, or so he had thought as he examined her; her breasts were still firm, her skin was still smooth and elastic. It was only her eyes that looked as though they had aged, and it truly was an intuition of experience one felt when gazing into her eyes rather than the eyes themselves. Aunt Laura rose from the chair in which she was sitting, dramatically placed in the corner in front of the lamp so that her silhouette would be dramatically featured against the illuminated background. She slowly walked over to Skiouros, powerfully gliding along the floor as if each step had its own independent purpose. Upon her arrival, she whispered into his ear, nibbling the earlobe along the way, that she was in fact not his Aunt, but rather his mother. 

Shocked by this traumatic and perplexing revelation, Skiouros was unable to formulate a response. During this period of silence, she explained that shortly after his birth in 1950, she began to hear internal voices, primarily that of a woman named Laura. Laura, who had become Aunt Laura, was a calloused hypersexual with an insatiable thirst for money and material possession; however, Skiouros' original mother, who prior to his birth had no psychological disorders, began to develop Munchausen by Proxy, the disorder which motivated individuals to hurt those they loved intentionally so that those hurt would develop a dependence on the afflictor of pain. Unable to allow his mother to hurt him, the Aunt personality dominated, ultimately eliminating the mother under the guise of collateral damage during the village uprising. As for his father, the mother had poisoned his food earlier that day during one of her Munchausen afflictions; however, the potency of the poison was too intense for him to survive. Clearly, Skiouros was conflicted and confused, both because she had saved his life from his mother, was actually his mother, but had been responsible for the death of his mother, who during her reign as mother, never exhibited any malevolent tendencies. She continued her confession, explaining that although she had thought Skiouros' mother was forever eliminated, she could sense the mother resurfacing within the depths of the Aunt's mind. Although she had failed to express her love in a healthy, symbiotic fashion, the Aunt truly loved him, and wanted him to be forever safe. Therefore, she had come to inform him of her final solution, to kill herself physically so that the mother could not return. However, before her death, she wanted to depart one last gift that would ensure a long life free of mortal disease. With this, she grabbed his neck and ravenously penetrated his flesh with her sharpened incisors. Skiouros felt a sense of desperation as the air and sensation seemed to flee from his body; however, this sensation was quickly replaced by an uncanny sense of euphoria, as if the fear had been placated by some external force. Hours later, Skiouros woke up with a rare hunger, the Aunt offered her blood, from which he drank until she was almost completely drained of blood. Then, as she had earlier stated, she threw herself from the highest window in the warehouse, exposing her pale flesh to the unforgiving sun, turning to ashes before her body ever hit the pavement.

Skiouros decided to remain in New York City simply because there was still something compelling about it. His temporal episodes increased in frequency, so much so that it became a distraction from work and from some daily interactions; however, it did bring about a sense of satisfaction and wisdom which he found increasingly desirable and less arcane. After a few months, he came in contact with other Malkavians, and finding some sense of unity, as disjointed and incomprehensible as it may had seemed to most others, associated with the clan quite frequently. Recently, he became the Primogen of the Malkavian clan -- a position which he still holds. In addition to money saved during his research days, he makes money through writing strange literature and the occasional person who wishes to stop by for a twisted psychic reading.

<b>Character Traits</b>

<b><i>Personality</b></i>: As a result of experiencing temporal anomalies in addition to the general dementia with which all Malkavians are burdened, Skiouros is perceived to be out of touch with daily reality. However, although he often communicates with words that are understandable, the content of what he says is occasionally incomprehensible or incoherent, like understanding passages from a book, but failing to understand the message given as a result of an absence of context. His dementia varies dramatically from moments of complete lunacy to brief occasions of perfect lucidity. During his more lucid moments, he may refer to himself in the third person, but not always. Moments of lucidity often occur immediately following a temporal episode in which he ""travels"" to a time period prior to his embrace.

He has a mild paranoia which is occasionally enhanced by the sight of military or police officers and sex workers who appear to be content in their current situation. Paranoia amongst other Malkavians is practically non-existent, and is negligible with members of other clans. Unlike many Malkavians which prefer solitude, he strives to incorporate many Malkavians into his everyday existence, and strives to create a sense of diplomacy between rival clans so that they can experience the freedom from the confines of sanity which tend to dull the mind and the spirit. 

<b><i>Allies/Enemies</b></i>: Skiouros' main ally is his mortal assistant Luscious, a former toothless prostitute who he removed from the confines of his Aunt's harem. No longer a prostitute and sporting an exquisite set of false teeth, her loyalty to him is incorruptible and eternal. Luscious tends to business that needs to be accomplished during the daylight hours, as well as provide him with transportation and protection to ensure any accidents do not arise from the paralysis caused by a temporal episode.

As a result of his writings and lectures which are further explained in the Resources section, he also has a cult following of mortals that appreciate his fiction and are mesmerized when he speaks. Skiouros also has allies with the lower members of the Malkavian clan that prefer company to solitude. These specific individuals, as well as any other allies, will be included as they are known or created.

He has no known living enemies at this time; however, the identities of enemies will be updated and disclosed as they are created. 

<b><i>Physical Appearance</b></i>: Skiouros has a slender physique, being approximately 6'1"" and around 150 pounds; however, the majority of his mass is muscle. He has large eyes which are primarily black with a magenta overtone; his eyes always seem to be emoting an intense expression. He has an olive complexion despite his lack of exposure to the sun and his hair is often dyed multiple outrageous colors and styled in a punk fashion. As a result of his time shifts, he has perceptions about what people are wearing in the future. Therefore, he can been seen wearing a variety of bizarre attire, from colored saran wrap to orange traffic cones. Often, he wears tight vinyl pants and brightly colored shredded tops. Furthermore, he likes to accent his wardrobe with various pieces of fabric tied around his waist to replicate a tail, since he was born with one. Without exception, he always wears his pair of wrist armor -- two ornately decorated, shiny metallic copper colored armcuffs which extend from the wrist to the elbow, that he inherited from his father after his death. 

<b>Resources</b>

<b><i>Residence</b></i>: Skiouros resides in a warehouse in the Soho district of New York City that was converted into a loft/studio many years ago. The only other permanent resident at this time is Luscious; however, the space is large enough to house other individuals, and does contain a space for mortal business transactions.

<b><i>Mode Of Transportation</b></i>: Skiouros does not drive himself, as a result of the unpredictable nature of his temporal paralysis. He prefers to walk on foot; however, if a vehicle is necessary, he will be driven by Luscious in a purple 2001 Honda Accord which has been adorned with sculptures of various geometric shapes which he believes prevents the government from tracking his movements. Fortunately, the general public simply attributes this vehicle to the eccentricities of an artist rather than subscription to this conspiracy theory.

<b><i>Equipment</b></i>: Skiouros finds that the most effective and gratifying way to subdue an enemy is through a scrambling of the mind. However, in situations where physical violence may present itself, he declines conventional and easily concealed weapons like guns and knives for more unexpected weapons. Thusly, in terms of physical weaponry, he either carries a crossbow or a mace. 

<b><i>Miscellaneous</b></i>: Skiouros, as a result of his previous research position, still has ties to the scientific community and access to various laboratories throughout the city. He can fund most ventures as a result of money saved during his research days as well as from money from his literature. He attempted to write down what he had seen during his hallucinations/temporal adventures. These attempts were later transformed into three published works of fiction: <i>Tail</i>, <i>Flower Of My Secret</I>, and <i>The Density Of Lunacy</i>; royalties collected from these works provide more than adequate income. 

<b>Character Specifics</b>

<B><i>Vampire Disciplines</b></i>: 

Dementation (Level V): Use of this discipline has always been innately powerful; however, it has received massive amounts of dedication not from a desire to use it in many situations among vampires of other clans, but as a magnificent asset should the need for combat arise. Realizing it is both a great defensive and offensive tool, it has been enhanced to a truly gifted level. Its potency is completely adequate to eliminate the sanity of mortals without effort.

Auspex (Level III): As a result of perceiving the mystical currents through which existence itself is bound, or at least the belief in this, he finds that he has a severely heightened perception of his environment and those individuals contained within it. His superior mastery of the discipline is demonstrated by the notion that what appears to be paralysis to others is actually a window into the disintegration of time. This ability also allows him to communicate occasionally with others through telepathic means, although the messages are often received as disjointed images rather than coherent words or messages.

Obfuscate (Level III): This discipline would be higher, except that Skiouros' outrageous demeanor tends to make him more conspicuous than many other Malkavians.

Level II Disciplines: Animalism, Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude, Potence, Presence, Protean. 

Unless otherwise noted, all conventional disciplines are at Level II as dictated by the Malkavian clan characteristics. 

<b><i>Flaws/Merits</b></i>: Skiouros' temporal episodes are more frequently triggered during periods of stress or confusion. Although in the perception of others, the paralysis tends to  last for only a few seconds, the paralysis can prove to be a detriment during interactions where an immediate response is required.

Skiouros, being born with a tail, has a inclination to enjoy and become distracted by creatures with disproportionately large and ostentatious tails or tail feathers. This primarily refers to squirrels and peacocks. If either one is seen, there is a possibility that he may become distracted, even during times of danger, or may regress into a state of diminished lucidity until the creature passes from his vision.

As an unanticipated resurfacing of suppressed trauma caused by working in his Aunt's harem, Skiouros will refuse to feed upon mortals who he has seen consume phallic shaped objects like bananas, eclairs, and corn dogs, in a suggestive, sexually provocative manner. Fortunately, since this fact is rarely advertised, it is likely to be a significant obstacle.

From having the belief that he can occasionally transcend linear existence, he has the ability to sense and even predict the outcome of some events before their occurrence, even if he is not directly involved in them. Also, this ability allows him greater access into the minds of those around him, and increases any latent telepathic or empathic abilities. This ability, although perplexing and obscure even to himself, can manifest itself either as  a remote viewing or as a inter-character telepathy.

Skiouros, considering himself an emissary to the Malkavian clan, tends to be more liked and accepted by members of rival clans than would a standard Malkavian.

<B><i>Generation</b></i>: Skiouros is currently an <b>8th generation</b> Malkavian Primogen.

<B><i>Physical, Social, And Mental Attributes</b></i>: 

Intelligence (Excellent): His many years of schooling and exposure to different stimuli have greatly enhanced his intellect.
Charisma (Excellent): Perhaps it is what is being said, or the way it is said, but people tend to listen and to agree.
Perception (Excellent): A byproduct of heightened Auspex skills as well as a supernatural connection to existence itself, he tends to perceive that which most are unable to see.

Wits (Average): Although he may have a high sense of perception, communicating it is usually most effective with other Malkavians.
Manipulation (Average): Others tend to do what he wants, but the problem is having that want understood all the time.
Appearance (Average): His appearance is unusual, and tends to torment many, at least those of mortal composition.
Stamina (Average): Not of a warrior or fighter level, but certainly comparable to most.

Strength (Poor): A lack of physical altercations combined with natural body structure, eliminated the need for this to be enhanced.

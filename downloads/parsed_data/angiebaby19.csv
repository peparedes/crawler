Ok Friday. Well I worked. And my rents were SUPPOSTED to go up north but since God hates me, my brother had a concussion and they had to stay home. So I didn't do nothin Fri. night.


Saturday. Didn't have to work so that was sweet. Me and my mom went shopping and bought a bunch of shit for school and such. Then Mel came over on her break and I took her back to work then picked her up when she got off. So we decided to get sum alcoholic beverages for the night. Yay. We went to Misty's house and chilled there for a few. Me and Misty went to Norrus' for a lil bit. Ummm then me, Misty, Chris, and Bret all went back to Mel's house. Wow. What a good night. We got trashed and had a good time. Ahhhh...I love that gurl. lol.


So yes, Sunday. Worked till about 8. Then me and Mel went to Seth's house to see Adri. I was so happy to see her. I miss that lady. So we were gonna go to the movies but that didn't happen. Lol. So we stayed there then went to Duran's on the way home. Mel stayed the night and it was fun as hell. And good news, Mel is getting a house key soon. We love it. haha.


Monday we woke up and went shopping for a few. Of course Ang has an obsession and bought more thongs. Wooo. They are so cute. But we didn't find nething else which made me mad. Umm, then I came home and went to work. After that I did nothing cuz my grandparents came over and then I had a shitload of homework I didn't do. 


You kno that you are an alcoholic when you get drunk before school. So yes that is what me and Mel did. lmao. We are so sweet. haha. It was funny as hell and fun as fuck. Then I didn't want to go to 4th hour so I made Jess skip with me. We went to McDonald's and then to Jayson's house to see everyone. That was so much fun. I missed her. But yah so it was a good day.


Now I'm sittin here cuz Mel is sleeping in my bed before she has to go to class. ""Excuse me but you're in my stretching space"". haha. She's nuts but you gotta love her. :D

So when I got home I watched the freakiest most f-ed up movie ever. Yahhh. House of 1000 Corpses. Wow. I was so scared and it gave me chills. Ahhhh. But it was actually a good movie, I recommend it.


Today. Mel came and got me and we went to her house for a lil bit. We went to pick up our checks at Outback, dropped off a movie, and picked up my pics. Then out to eat wit her fam. That was interesting. Mel kicked my ass in the Trivia game thingy. She rocked. Her fam is outta control tho. But it was a good laugh so I'm not complaining. :)


So after. We cashed Mel's check then came back to my house. And it's let's be gay night for the rents so they made me stay home instead of goin to hang out wit Mel and Misty. Oh well.

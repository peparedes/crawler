"event","Well it's been awhile, but this thing wasnt working but i fixed it...sooo.....well a lot has happend latly, starting with the death of two very close people to me.  My aunt Katie, and little Ally died last month in a car accident.  IT was really hard to get over @ first, and still havn't fully excepted that the life of two wonderful people has ended, and i dont get how it could have, and why that mother fucker had to drive on the WRONG SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. like, i dont get how you could drive across the median on the highway and not notice it...but ya what ever.  so tonight I went to the Hincks, and had dinner with Kate, Dave, and uncle Ricky, just like we used to do before all this happend.  The Gagnons came to which was nice, because that is how i remember them, our three familys spending as much time toghether as we possibly could.  I feel so bad for Kate, I could never imagine loosing my mom and sister @ my age, but you can tell she definatly is having a hard time with it.  Kate hunny I love you and im always here for you kiddo.  

But on kind of a better note, i got an A!!!! i thought i was just gonna get all C's, but i got 3 C's a B and an A! that kinda made me happy...i guess im not as dumb as i thought. 

Thats it for now I guess, its definatly bed time"

"event","nothing has happend latly.  Well, i havnt.  my grammy is sick so i have just been majorly spacing.  I havnt done homework, or gotten off the couch in a few days.. I was at Ashtons sunday and my dad called and said she went to the hosptial becasue she took one of her pain pills and she had a hard time breathing...at least i think thats what happend..my dad doesnt tell me much. she was better by the afternoon though so i wasnt to worried.  but around 10 my dad told me that him and mom were leaving because she got really sick but that is all they would tell me.  my dad didnt tel me much..but from what i heard from his phone conversations...she almost died.  they took the day off monday and tuesday to go up but they wouldnt let me go.  I went up today and now i know why.  I cant stand seeing her like this. There is so much we still need to do.  Next time i was going to her house she was going to teach me how to knit.  It was good seeing all of my family though at the hosptail today.  It helped alot.  I went in with my dad to see her because only 2 can at a time or whatever and that was really hard because i have never seen him cry before..and he almost did.  having my cousins and aunts/uncles there really helped. i was there for  a few hours then had to come home.  I feel so guilty everytime i do anything...like if i laugh, i feel guilty becuase shecant laugh, and i am just so fucking scared and dont know what to do.  But Brendan has really been there for me the last few days, so hjasnt shane which is really nice.  Thank you everyone for helping me..it means alot

ya im gonna stop rambling now"

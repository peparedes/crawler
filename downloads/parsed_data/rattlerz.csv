"event","if it wasn't for the science program here at st. marys i would have left this school a long time ago. everyone is so immature and stupid. i dont know about anyone else but everyone here is far more immature than everyone in my high school. its so stupid how no one will talk to anyone unless they are a part of their ""group"". its like you go to a party and you dont even know if it will be fun or if there are going to be bithcess and assholes giving you ugly looks just because you're not kissing their ass like everyone else.  and heaven forbid you bring someone who doesnt go to st. marys. that is the reason why i hardly ever go to any of the parties that stmu students throw. anyways, i just needed to bitch once again about this stupid school"

"event","to catch up:
i never thought that i would ever miss the people in my high school that i left hating. well i wont say what happened but lets just say girls at st. mary's are full of drama. back home i never had drama and its sad to say that my first high school moment happened in college. well if i did ever experience some drama it was nothing compared to the one experience here at good ol' stmu. back home when you had probelms with a person you would confront them, tell them off, even kick thier ass if need be. after that day though people moved on and went their seperate ways. the issue was resolved in one afternoon. here bitches like to drag on the problen and act all childish. its quite funny and pathetic really. but oh well all that matters is that i've moved on.

anyways other than that. atlanta was fun, school still sucks and i cant wait for it to be over

im going home this weekedn so that will be fun"

"event","yesterday was the most random day. in the morning during biochem this dog cam in to the class out of no where. i guess he also wanted to avoind the rain. what a way to start the morning. then for english we had to write a sonnet and of course i didnt. she only wanted a rough draft so i didnt think she'd actually pick them up, but of course she did. so i told her i would give it to her by the end of the day. then for lab the most wonderful thing happened. we only had a lecture and no wet lab. so we got out like at 3:30. so then i get to my room and one of our friends is in here and i remebred she is good at writting peotry, so i asked her for help. and she ended up writing the whole thing for me and it only took her like 10 mintues. it was GREAT. it was overall a good day. 

this morning i woke up at 12:08 and i have cal at 12:20 and i eneded up missing physcis. it was horrible. i guess i had to make up for yesterday

unfortunately tomorrow i have a biochem test and i am freaking out. i need to do really well and i hate having that kind of pressure. so back to studying.. wish me luck

anyways this weekend my family came down and it was great. we went shopping at foley's like at 10. yay for it being open 'till 12. anyways, sunday we went to this shopping center that sold mainly jewlery and purses. it was a cool place. they hadd all sorts of necklace sets. even those sparkly ones that are sold individaully at the mall in those little stands. the sets were like $6. we didnt get to do that much shopping there because everyone still had to drive back, so they left early. 
anyways, i feel like i really, really, really dont want to go back to school. its something about st. mary's that im not looking forward to being there again. hmmm, could it be the MCAT? damn test. i didnt even study shit like i was planning, so im screwed. oh well. here's to a year of no sleep or social life"

"event","this weekend was crazy. lets start with the stupid GRE class. so for the verbal and essay part of the GRE the classes were split up. last satruday we focused on the stories and senetence completion. this past saturday we were suppose to go over our essays and do analogies. the same guy was teaching both saturdays. last saturday i was the first one there and everyone shoed up like 10 minutes late. this past saturday everyone showed up 20 mintues late. so he was already mad that again everyone was late. then he asked the class if we knew the meaning of this one word. fof course no one knew it so we all stayed quiet. this one girl had made notcards of words that were in the book they gave us. so i asked her if that word was in her notecards. i guess other people were talking because the man got all mad and said that we didnt acknowledge he was there. so he steps out of the room and starts bitching about the entire class to the coordinator that was there. he comes in to the room and hands out examples gives us the answers, hands back our essays and tells us to leave. 
so at least we got out early. we all thought the whole thing was funny. 
annyways. i went back to my sisters and was bored out of my mind. so my old roomate calls me up and says that several people are going to have dinner so i decide to drive down to galveston and go. thats how bored i was. i then went fishing with my sister, her husband, and some of their friends. so that was fun. i caught 3 small fish. i was so happy. 
after catching up on my sleep on sunday. i went to this stupid church, if u can even call it that. it was retarded. it was a waste. i really wanted to go to an actual mass. oh well
my mom came down so that was fun. she here for two whole weeks. susy and my dad left to LA to visit my brother, but it was nice seeing them.

so i dont know if y'all remember me talking about this bulemic girl in the program. well she went tubing with several people in the program at the guadalupe river. for those who have been you know that the river is really cold. well my roomate told me that she was about to colapse because she got so cold. i mean if us normal people are cold can u imagine her. she has like no body fat. i felt so bad that shes like that. and that even when they had been out of the water for a while (like 4 hours) she was still shaking.
poor girl
so that was this weekends drama."

"event","so yesterday i didnt have to be in lab until 10 because they were cleaning the BSL3 lab. i knew parking was going to be hard to find, but i still decided to wake up later and drive at a later time. so ofcourse when i got here there was no parking. i drove around for a while and finally found one all far from my lab. so after walking like a mile, i was almost close to my lab when i was hit by a bird!! thats right HIT. the damn crow flew right next to me and hit my cheek with his damn wing. i got so scared because it came from behind. I HATE BIRDS!! that should have waved a flag that yesterday was not going to be a very good day. so i was doing my transformations and i had an hour to spare. so i decided to go pick up my check and deposit it in my bank because its not that far. i was walking to my car and about to take out my keys when i noticed they were no where to be found. i thouhgt i had lost them and i was praying that i had just left them in there. and of course they were. so i had to call a locksmith to open my car. it took like a second for him to open it. it was the fastest 40 he ever made. 
i got out of work at 5 after i went back from the drama of my car. i had an hour to spare since we were going to have a dinner at our coordinators house. you know, the one that looks like dr. wild. so i decided to do some shopping. i bought the last two books of dan brown. hopefully they are as good as the others. 
hopefully today wont be so full of drama as yesterday.

"event","not much happened this weekend. i moved out of the condo i was staying in. there was no problems with the roomies, but it was so expensive. i decided to live with my sister, rent free, for the rest of the summer. why i didnt do this earlier, i dont know. i enjoyed the time i was there because i did get to meet a lot of people. it wasnt like at a&m where it was just st. mary's crew. i actually had to meet people.lol 

so i am planning on staying in an apartment next year. my sister found these cool apartments that are being built on bandera. 3 bedroom for only 7 something. BUT, there is a stupid requirement that we dont meet. first of all, they dont do cosigners, but since we are full time students they agreed to have one. all tenants and cosigners must earn a minimum of 4,000 a month! why would anyone who makes that kind of money want an apartment and not a house? thats ridiculous 4,000. excuse us poor people. AND if u are a student who doesnt have a cosigner you have to make a minimum of 2,000 a month. yeah because i dont even make that in a semester's worth of work study. why if rent is so cheap do tenants have to make so much? so it doesnt look like we will be getitng those. the search continues. any suggestions?

im still here in lab just waiting around. i could've left already but i have a lab meeting at 3:30. i've had nothing to do since 11. and there is only so much you can do on the computer. so i took a 2 1/2 hour lunch. well that includes this seminar we had to go to. they ususally feed us there, but they ran out of meat. by the time i got there there was nothing. so i had to buy my own lunch."

later we went to this girls hotel to eat. it was fun and i was talking to these two guys about kaplan. they strongly recommended it. but they said that you have to use ALL of their resources. you cant just go to class and expect to do well. i asked them what they got and one of them got a 35 and the other a 36. yeah i was in shock because they were so not cocky about it at all. and they are really cool. not like that guy brice who expected everyone to kiss his ass because of what he got. one of them was saying that his montor at kaplan had suggested that he take a worst case scenerio mcat prep test. so he agreed. he said that his mentor and him went to a bar, got wasted, and woke up extra early to take the test. and do u want to know what he got? a 30!! i wish i got that now. 

so that was my adventure. what a day. 
and i stil dont know what im doing for 4th of july. i hope something fun.

"event","this saturday was our first official GRE class.  it was sooooo boring. imagine taking a prep class on the SATs. its basic algebra and geometry. what the hell does that have anything to do with grad school? 

anyways after class i rushed over to my sisters because i thouhgt we were leaving early to SA. but ofcourse things dont always go as planned. we finally left my sisters house at 6. but then we stopped to eat at applebees (so no complaints on stopping and eating). but then we went to outdoor world. so by the time we were actually on the road it was 11. we got in to SA at 1. my sister and i stayed talking to my mom until 4 in the morning and we had to get up at 7 to leave. we went beacuse my sister was going to leave my nephew with my mom because she went on a cruise. so got in to houston at 11. then i had to go drop them off at the cruise terminal. so by the time i finally got to rest it was 3 in the afternoon.
 
i also watched the movie the incredibles yesterday. its sooo cute. i really liked it."

"event","yesterday was a long day in lab. i didnt get out of lab 'till 5:15. thats the longest day i've had to since i've been there. so the police have decided not to grant me access to my building. you know how us students like to deal with selective agents and terrorize people with it. so im going to be a nuisance to my lab from now on because they have to go down and sign me in and out. 
anyways, i didnt do much yesterday. i just went to wash the salt off my car. damn hotel has to be so close to the beach. today we go on a boat trip so that we can see the wonders that is galveston. that would take what, ten minutes. lol. it actually a whole hour long. we are having dinner after, so that should be fun.

 i think i'm going to end up moving to my sisters because it will be cheaper than living where i am. so hopefully by next week i will no longer have to share a one bedroom condo with  3 people."

"event","so yesterday i went at it with the lady at the front desk. i was bitchin' about our internet not working. at first my voice sounded upset, but then the bitch decides to raise her voice and i just went off. she was telling me that maintenance had been notified of the problem and that if they could fix it they would. (what do u mean IF they can fix it, they better fix it)so i asked her, well if they can't fix it what then, what am i suppose to do. the bitch said ""dont assume it's not going to get fixed. i didnt say that they couldnt fix it because they wont know until they get there. and if they can fix it they will."" so the i started yelling telling her that i can assume whatever the hell i want and i can assume that its not going to get fixed because in the past two weeks nothing has been done and if it doesnt get fixed then what the fuck was i suppose to do. 
at this time my roommate got the phone and started to talk to the lady telling her that she wanted the managers number and that she was going to call everday until it got fixed. or she would be there at the front desk bitchin about the problem until something got done. 
and of course they went to the room and of course it still doesnt work

to liven up the day, some of the people in the program and i went to go play beach volleyball. it was a lot of fun. i hadn't played since high school and i'd forgotten how much i like it. we are definitely playing again. that was basically the highlight of my day. 
this weekend i'm going back home so i'm excited. i can't wait. im just counting down the days until saturday. i'm only going for a night, but i'll settle for that. it beats not going home at all. 

this is so random, but i just thought i'd share. there is this girl in the program who i take to the GRE classes on sat. she is sooooooo skinny. like i'm anorexic or bulimic skinny. when we went kayaking she was waring a bathing suit and u couldnt help but look at how skinny she was. it's hard not to wonder why she's so skinny, but i just thought that some people really are that skinny and can't help it. anyways, yesterday one of the guys that went to go play with us said that the other day he had gone running with that girl and that she burned him. she was a lot faster and had more endurance than he does. this girls said, ""no wonder she's so skinny"". and the guy said that she IS bulimic. we asked him how he knew and he said that u could tell by looking at her teeth and gums. i just thought its so sad that's she's like that because you could tell that she's not a healthy skinny."

"event","so friday night i decide to go to nick's house (the other student who works in my lab) with my two roomates.  i'm a little shy around people i've never met, so i was kind of quiet the whole time. but overall it was fun. i played this beer game, i forgot what it was called, but it was fun. loser me had never even heard of it, but thats just me. you basically form a triangle with beer cups, with only three rows, at both ends of the table. the key is to make it into ur opponet's cups with a ping pong ball. if u make it the other team has to drink that cup of beer. what can i say, i lost. so not only did i have to dtink all if my cups, but theirs as well. good times. and to top it off, i had to take a  practice GRE test in saturday. that wasnt too bad. its kind of like the SATs that includes two essays. 
i also went to my sisters this weekend. im staying over there until tuesday because she and her husband are out of town and i have to take care of their dog. 
traffic was a btich this morning. what should  have taken me 30 or 40 minutes to get to school actually took me a little over an hour.

"event","so since last summer i promised that i was going to atlesast read any book since i hardly do any of that. so i asked ashley to lend me one of her books and i ofcourse never read it. but yesterday waiting on my PCRs, the other student in the lab told me i look bored, do u want a book to read. so he lend me his copy of Angels and Demons by dan brown (its the prequal to da vincci code). and i loved it. after i got out of lab i called several book stores to see if they had a copy of it so that i can continue to read it. after like 7 that i called i finally found someone who had it. luckily it was down the street where im staying so i didnt have to go that far. what made it better was that near that bookstore was marple slab. so later that night we went out for ice cream. we also went to the beach. anyways, the book is so entertaining. im half way done and i started yesterday. i even stayed up reading, which is why im so tired today. 

i didnt drive to school today and im regret that because im done for the day  and the bus doesnt get here till 5!!! tomorrow is my first GRE class. even thoough i dont plan on taking the test, it was only 25 dollars as oppose to 1100. so what the hell 
the student in my lab invited me over to his house because he's having people over just to hang out. it sounds like fun, but when i asked him at what time he said around 11. i've become such an early bird that it seems to be so late. damn UTMB is draining me and turning me into a dork. 
well im gong back to my reading, being that i have 2 1/2 hrs. to go"

"event","so yesterday was the first day without my mentor. i was left under the supervision of their lab tech. and i hate that. the tech's nice and all but she's kind of just babysitting me and she doesnt really know what my project is and i dont want to fall behind on it. 
the entire lab went to go eat at this restaurant where they serve south american food. it was pretty good. the only bad thing was that because people had to be back early, we left at like  11:45 and i was just barely finishing my mini preps and because i was being rushed i put in double the amount of one solution. i hope that didnt affect anything. i'm a little worried.
anyways, i was done with everything that i had to do by 2:30. i literally had nothing to do and i asked her if there was anything else and she told me no. so then i asked her if i could leave and she was like ""ok"". since when is ""ok"" an answer to a question, but whatever. i felt kind of bad leaving because it was so damn early, but what was i going to do. sit and stare at the wall till 5. yeah right. luckily i drove yesterday and i got to leave early. 
i am not looking forward to these next three weeks. today i have a meeting with my P.I. so we'll see what he says about my project. 
in the afternoon i went to the pool with a couple of people in the program and we went to go eat at this greek restaurant. it was pretty good."

oh well. every tuesday we have to go to seminars like the ones we would go to at a&m. and yesterday our speaker was talking about rodopsin. aww cell bio memories. (and they arent good ones)
i also had a lab meeting which wasnt too bad. i have a scheduled meeting with THE BOSS on thursday im a little nervous. 

this morning i was planning on taking the shuttle so that i wont waste gas, but i just could not wake up for the life of me. so i drove here again. maybe today i can go over to the gym. i promised my sister i would get in shape before school started. and so far i've been off to a bad start. i've gone twice to the gym in the past two weeks."

as i mentioned earlier, student parking here is all along the side of the street. so today i had to parallel park and i got it on my first try. i thought i was going to be there forever trying to figure it out. im just here at the library waiting to go in to lab. today my mentor gets here from out of town so ill be meeting him for the first time. ahh scary. and sadly i will also be meeting the new post doc that im going to be with for the next three weeks because the grad student im with right now is getting married. he's so nice. and i really like him. i just hope the new one is as cool as he is. we'll see"

yesterday i went to one of the professor's house that is in charge of the program. you know the one that looks like dr. wild. anyways, he has a beautiful house. its right on this lake. so several students were attempting to kayak. only one student fell into the water. good times.

<P>so today because i need someone to open the door everywhere, its kind of embarrasing to ask my male mentor to come escort me to the bathroom, wait for me, and escort me back. so during lunch i was practically peeing in my pants. so that was intersting. </P>

overall one of my roomates is really nice and the other one is kind of mean beacuse she has literally said like two words to us. but oh well. 
yesterday we also had a cook out for all thoise in the program and i swear one of the professors in charge reminded me of dr. wild. only the funny thing was that he was wearing the tiniest shorts i had ever seen. i wouldnt even wear them. it was so funny.
today we had what had to be the longest orientation of my life. i was falling asleep. im just glad its over.

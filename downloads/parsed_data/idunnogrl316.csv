"event","Hello!!! 
I'm alive, I promise...
Thanksgiving was nice, two of my friends who go to Rice and didn't go home for thanksgiving came over.  I think they scared my parents, I don't realize how smart they are untill I actually think about how they must sound to other people.  They spent at least an hour discussing how to build your own computer from scratch with my dad and being amazed with books on soil engineering on our bookshelf.  And Ian talked about how he invests overseas.  I dunno.  We then got into a long discussion about D&D (dungeons and dragons) and they decided I should join their group thing (whatever they call them).  So now I'm a hypothetical monk-assassin (female, I might add.  I didn't know there was such a thing as a female monk, but aparently they exist in D&D world.  And being a monk gives me martial arts skills...).  Although I don't think I'll ever find the time to play.  Gosh I'm becoming such a nerd!  AHHH! 
As for school, busy as usual.  Our last day of finals isnt untill the 20th ahhh.  And I have 5 finals :( And a paper.  Hopefully I can be done by the 15th so I can visit my sister in CS for her birthday on the 18th.  Well see how productive I can be..."

"event","Yeah ok so update!
Life has been crazy busy; all my classes have caught up with me at once and so my workload is harder then ever :(.  Three tests last week...  Hopefully this week will be a little better, because fall break is next weekend.  And the weekend after that NOD!! Theme: NODical adventure: a tribute to seamen.  Gotta love Rice...  I didn't do any work this weekend, yet.  I'm trying to avoid the library because thats kinda where I lived last week, studying. But its sad that thats the place where I can be the most productive.  
This afternoon, powderpuff game!  I'm a starter this year, at least I have been for the first three games, but I think that thats because the startes weren't all there.  I play o-line now, which I don't really understand, but I get pretty bruises.  And Monday night football!!  Go broncos! AHHH
As for drama, that's caught up with me too unfortunately.  I'm seriously debating swearing off of boys forever...  It's gotten so bad that my roomate says shes been having dreams about my boy problems...  Miss you all a bunch.  I will get around to calling yall sometime, I hope.  Love you lots!"

"event","So on Monday, I went down to Rice to help Davinia move into our room. The door to my single off of the common room was unlocked, so I got to arrange all of my furniture and stuff.  But it was way too hot to be moving the couch, recliner and boxes up the stairs.  I suppose I should be used to the humidity after lifeguarding all summer, but that is something I don't think I'll ever become acclimated to. After we moved in, me and 6 other ppl piled into my car and we drove to whataburger for dinner.  And then to get boba tea.   

Anyways all of the advisors for orientation week were going to go camping on Tuesday, and they said I could go too, although I'm not an advisor.  So I drove back to Kingwood on Monday night, and then took the bus back down to Rice yesterday morning.  We drove to San Marcos and ""floated the river"" and were going to stay the night there at a little campsite thing, but the owner was going to charge an extra 5 dollars a person.  We decided that $100 for our party was a little much.  We were all hot and sweaty and gross, so we drove back to Houston instead.  And I spent the night at my bed in Martel in my sleeping bag.  I don't think that I would be very good at the whole backpacking thing like yall are. 

So Matt drove me back home this morning with Davinia who wanted to pick up some things that I had kept at my house bc they wouldn't fit in the storage area.  But in a blonde moment, I left my sleeping bag and my duffel bag in his car.  So now they're back at rice.  And so I won't have my toothbrush etc. back until Sat when I move in. Ahhh..."

"event","Ok yeah so an update...
I got a job!  Yay!  I was proactive for once and it paid off.  So anyways I got an email from our water polo captain saying that the aquatics director was looking for ppl to lifeguard during freshman orientation week. So I emailed the lady and went down there today to meet her and stuff.  I got a t-shirt, and a staff badge and a schedule!!  I was going to apply for a lifeguard job anyways so now i don't need to fill out an application or do a resume (which I had been procrastinating on all summer).  I am also excited about this b/c it means that I get to move on campus a week early (and the aquatics ppl pay for my housing and food for that week).  :)  So an extra week to get all of my stuff moved into my room and organized (which i need).  AND I'll be w/ Davinia during this time and not having to drive back and forth to see her.  ALSO she comes on Sunday.  (ie the 13th)  and I help her move her stuff into our common room on Mon. !  And I'm spending the night w/ Anita this weekend.  Aww yay for girl time. So now I'm moving in the 20th.  Classes start the 28th. :)  I also kinda have a job as a physics grader kinda.  So now I can save up money for europe (PRAGUE?:)...)"

"event","So the 4th was fun.  Not as much so as that one 4th in Midland at 6 mile w/ the fireworks and driving the jeep into the ditch (which I think the 4th will allways remind me of.  I went downtown (again).  The Houston Symphony played patriotic songs at Herman park which is right by Rice complete w/ the 1812 overture and CANNONS!  Then fireworks.  Then discussions of patriotism w/ the 4 guys I went w/ (all Indian)(well kinda).  No work today! I got to sleep in!   

Anyways I need to figure out when I'm comming to Midland.  I really want to come when I get to see everyone...  The problem is, I was originally going to come the last weekend in July; that's when I sceduled vacation days for work and such.  But now burn won't be back untill that Sunday.  So she thinks I should come the next weekend, i.e. the 4th through the 7th prolly.  But I might be able to have the 3rd off too... we'll see.  Anyways, will people still be in town then, and Jenny and Steph esp when is camp over, and Jenifer were you going to be in Midland at all?  Ahhh so complicated."

So burn, this one made me think of you.  And New Zeland.  And Cole.  And Kevin.  And backpacking.  If anyone would colonize new planets I could totally see you doing it.  Don't ask me why. It reminds me of an Orson Scott Card book.  So Matt loaned me Speaker for the Dead against my protests against science fiction.  I think that he is trying to get me to like it.  ALready he's loned me two matrix-like sci fi books:  Neuromancer and Snow Crash.  Have you heard of them?  They were written quite a while ago.  But it's cool b/c of the things that they predicted as part of the future are actually here in some form.  For example in the last one there was this thing that was completely analogous to google earth.  WHich my dad is totally addicted to.  But anyway i digress...

In the famous word of Ryan North: MORAL: if you are faced with something that doesn't seem to have a desirable solution, maybe try adding rockets! space rockets! 

Also this one made me think of all of yall too...

Oh and I'm back from the cruise in case you didn't notice.  More on that later.  Back to work today actually.  I might go down to Rice and see superman tonight.  But my parent's decided to start charging me for taking the car down there: 10$ each time.  Which is annoying but I guess justifiable b/c of the price of gas.  But my wallet is considerably lighter after Mexico.  I bought this hammock-chair thing like the one that Jonothan used to have in his room w/ the pool table and stuff.  If I loft my bed, i think that I can hang it from the underside of it w/ an s-hook or something.  Is this the right word?  I have a single next year, so I can decorate the way I want, IF I can get motivated enough.  But again another tangent..."

"event","So the weekend was pretty busy.  The Bells just got back from a cruise so they were in town on Friday.  We had dinner and they spent the night.  It was so good to see them again and to find out about what's happening over in Midland...
On Saturday, I woke up early and went to the Galeria with my sister and my dad.  My sister bought a pair of shoes and I got a necklace that I can wear with my twirly blue skirt.  :)
That afternoon I lifeguarded the birthday party of one of the daughter's of one of my mom's co-workers.  It was fun.  Except I got like 20 mosquito bites.  It was funny: There was a little boy there named fransua.  That was kinda cool.  The dad of the little girl kept giving me grapes, saying I had to keep hydrated. I dunno...:) I think I had more grapes yesterday that I've had the entire year...  After the party, I was downtown, so I went to Rice.  Me and all the guys:  Adit, Siva, Mithun, and Deep went to go eat sushi!  And naturally the guys had wasabi-eating contests: to prove their Manhood or something I guess.  I don't really understand.
Yesterday I worked a swim team party.  It was crazy.  There were something like 150 kids in the pool at the same time.  But I had Rosa's tortillas and rice!  Because my mom and my bro brought them back from Midland.  THey went up there for the weekend.
This morning we're leaving on a cruise!  Off to cozumel..."

"event","So acording to Davinia, in relationships girls fall into four types. 

There are those that are high-maintenance, but know that they are high-maintnence. There are those that think they are high-maintenance, but are really low-maintenance. Likewise, there are those that are low maintenence and know it, and then those that think they are low maintenence but are really high maintenence. 

Acording to her, I fall into the last category which ""is the worst to be in"" because it means I'm hard to please. She might have a point. Maybe this is my problem. 

This reminds me of the four types of presidential character we learned in government: active-positive, passive-positive, active-negative, and passive-negative. I know, I am a nerd. But I looked them up in my old government notes because I kinda remembered them, but not really, and it was bothering me. And I was bored. It actually fits in a sorta convoluted way. But it means that presidentially I'm in the same category as Nixon, Hoover, and Johnson. I don't know how I feel about that. But it could depend on your interpretation.  I could also be like Reagan and Clinton.  Not much better. :) <a href=""http://academic.regis.edu/jriley/414%20presidential_character.htm"">if you're interested and bored too...</a>"

"event","So finals were crazy and torture.  I think that the only thing that kept me sane was the water polo trip to chicago in the middle of them.  I had to try to squeeze all my studying time in mostly before and after and the accademic advisor gave me a hard time about going, but it was great!  And so pretty!  The weather was gorgeous the last day we were there, like 75 or so and the previous days it was even cold.  It was strange.  It was beautiful because everything was blooming; there were tulips along all of the streets in Evanston (the city we were actually in b/ thats where northwestern is.)  The pool itself wasn't the greatest, but it had a suit dryer and was right on the shore of lake michigan.  So you would walk out the back door and be on the beach.  It was great bc I love all the water polo girls to death.  Next year will be interesting though bc our coach is retiring, and well have a much harder time convincing the academic people to let us go in the middle of finals.  So after the trip, 2 more finals, but my motivation was leaving me fast.  I finished about 4:30 on Wednessday (like a week and a half ago); and didn't leave untill friday, but Thursday was pretty much spent packing (and sleeping in untill 1).  I also had a date :).  But things are complicated in that area as they always seem to be... And now I'm home.  Davinia (my roomate) was in town for a while.  More on that later...
 Oh and trip pictures!

It reminded me of the old swim meet days;  crowded warm up, the great feeling of finally getting dry after being in a wet suit all day, etc...  We won all 3 of our games today; we played against Baylor and UT too.  The bad thing is we're leaving again tomorrow at 7:45.  And I haven't gotten any work done this weekend... oh well."

"event","Today was a beautiful day, 77 and sunny.  There were people studying out on the sun deck in their swim suits.  

I have fallen in love with water polo, even though I am not very good at it.  Its so much fun and I didn't know how much I missed swimming until I really started doing it again.  We have mini 1 hr workouts just swimming at the beginning of each practice, and I feel like I'm getting more and more in shape, although I know that I'll never get back up to where I was.  For the swimmers:  the other day we did a set like we used to do on Ted's team, 4 100s, 4 75s 4 50s 4 25s descending one to four, 2x.  The first round was free and I actually went a 1:08 on the ""fast"" 100, which is good for where I am right now, don't laugh, burn :).  The next round we did IM, but they let us do freestyle head-up instead of fly!  We work out a lot, 4x a week for 2 hrs, and next week is ""hell week""  so that will be interesting.  We'll see how I feel about water polo next Sunday :).  I'm looking forward to the tournaments, they're all out of town- our first is in college station, so maybe I can see you, Steph!.  We have a tournament in FL the last weekend of spring break!

Opera friday night!  Don Basquale (sp?) which was amazing.  We got free tickes through rice and had excelent seats.  It was fun to dress up.  In March, they're doing Carmen!

Last night was interesting.  Moulin Rouge casino night, as Jenny said an excuse to dress slutty.  I wore my corset :).  But I discovered that running in high heels on wet coblestone pavement is not a good idea.  I also found that my heels have no traction.  It hurt, but the party was fun for the most part.  A lot of dancing, but more evidence to the theory that many boys are stupid."

""Give a man a fire and he's warm for a day, but set fire to him and he's warm for the rest of his life""

""And therefore education at the University mostly worked by the age-old method of putting a lot of young people in the vicinity of a lot of books and hoping that something would pass from one to the other, while the actual young people put themselves in the vicinity of inns and taverns for exactly the same reason."" 

""He was the sort of person who stood on mountaintops during thunderstorms in wet copper armour shouting 'All the Gods are bastards.'""

""They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it's not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.""

""It is often said that before you die your life passes before your eyes. It is in fact true. It's called living.""

""One of the universal rules of happiness is: always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual.""

""Using metaphor in front of a man as unimaginative as Ridcully was like a red flag to a bu-- was like putting something very annoying in front of someone who was annoyed by it.""

""He was not, by the standard definitions, a bad man; in the same way a plague-bearing rat is not, from a dispassionate point of view, a bad animal.""

""No one had asked her, before she was born, whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether she'd prefer, say, a miserable personality but a body that could take size 9 in dresses. Instead, people would take pains to tell her that beauty was only skin-deep, as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair of kidneys."""

SOme of the houses were doubbly gated and you had to call the intercom button to get them to open the gate to the driveway.  Quote of the night: ""I'd say that's quite indicative of the upper crust (said in a fake british accent)"" .  Kevin dresed up as a british gentleman and was saying that all night long in this sean connery voice.  It made me laugh. Maybe you had to be there. :).

"event","Yay, today is Friday!!!
Not to mention, midterms are finally over and we get fall break (another long weekend, and this time I will be going home voluntarily and won't spend the long weekend watching the weather channel).
Midterm exams were alright, and I didn't fail any of them, (the closest I came was a 77 on my diferential equations exam but that is to be expected).  The mythologies exam was crazy though; it was all short essay and take home which meant an hour and a half of straight typing in front of the computer from 10:30-midnight last night (I ended up with almost 4 pages, single spaced, something I would have never thought possible).  Like Jenifer, I am perfectly happy with the fact that I won't be an A student anymore, and it's kinda nice not to have that pressure or expectation from others anymore.  
Did I mention I'm excited about the 4 day weekend? Plus negligible homework, YAAAAAAAYYY.
Tonight is Gary Johnson's birthday, so theres a party up in Sid (the college).  Us Martel girls bought him a bottle of acholol(Kaluah), which is an appropriate present seeing as how I don't think I have ever seen the guy sober.  It will also be an interesting night because he's one of Felix's suitemates (there's a story behind this but its a long one that will have to wait until later)...
I'll probably end up going home around Sunday sometime, and i might try to go up to A&M on Monday night ( I miss my sister, and maybe I could see you this way too steph?)

"event","So...
Yesterday was my suitemate Christine's birthday.  So our room got the bright idea that because she loves dancing, we could have a dance party/rave in our common room last night. We put together a music mix, and then got one of those twirly light balls and a fog machine.  Were like ok, a fog machine might set of the fire alarm, so we decided to cover the smoke detector in the common room.  The only problem was that we thought the alarm on the wall was the smoke detector, when the real smoke detector was actually hiding on the ceiling.  So were getting the room ready to surprise her when she gets back from a symphony concert she went to.  Of course, the fire alarms go off; not just in our room, but all of Martel.  Everyone comes out on their balconies and start milling around the commons just as Christine walks up.  Meanwhile, the fog is pouring out of our now-open door so it is pretty obvious who set of the alarm...

Then last night was also Martel Pub night; one of the many benefits of having a wet campus and a bar in the Student Center basement.  Free beer and pizza for everyone from Martel, and I knew one of the bartenders from my LPAP...

The hurricane's comming.  Parent's weekend is canceled, so is my brother's school for the next 2 days.  (Lucky.  I still have a big chem test tomorrow.  Does anyone know how to name chemichal compounds or graph electron probability density graphs?)  My mom's pretty nervous, along with the other people of Kingwood aparently.  SHe says they've run out of gas, and people are leaving already.  Rice is pretty safe.  We have backup generators for our backup power generators.  And in true Rice style we're throwing a party in honor of the hurricane.  As for me, I joined the ""Lovely Rita, Hurricane"" facebook group..."

"event","Well here's my update...
Getting into the second week of school means a lot of work, but I'm having my share or fun, and next weekend is a three-day weekend so yay.  I'm going home (to Kingwood) on Saturday and I actually have work lined up on Sunday and Monday.  This is a good thing, I'm trying to tell myself, because buying books killed my checking account, and they pay extra on labor day weekend.

This weekend was a lot of fun.  Friday night, I went ""college hopping""  which is the normal Friday night pastime around here.  Started of at Martel; I tried Captain Morgan (shots and w/ coke), had some vodka in there too, and one of my suitemates can make an excelent Bloody Mary (which I had never tried before either).  I was slightly tipsy by the end of this, but didn't drink any more the rest of the night, so just joined up w/ groups of people i knew and walked around.  I got back to Martel and watched the last half of Boondock Saints (in a guy's lap).  After the movie, we went to Taco Cabanna (my first time there)which was surprisingly crowded for 3 in the morning. Back at Martel, I got a drunk phone call from my sister and then went to bed.  On Saturday, I went home to pick up a couch w/ Evan (the guy from the night before; he has a truck) and my two suitemates.  Saturday night, we played Lord of the Rings Risk, and a huge thunderstorm blew in, so we stood out on the balconies and watched people playing mud soccer down in the Martel ""quad.""  Sunday night, we went to the Movie theatre downtown to watch Four Brothers (a pretty good movie).

Now I'm procrastinating on homework (as usual).  I have a chem class after lunch and a Physics and Math tutorial scheduled at the same time tonight (I don't know how that will work out).  I miss you guys a lot!  I hope yall are having fun wherever you are..."

Last night I went to go see Wedding Crashers again, I opted out of the club experience mainly because I was SO tired.

Today was outreach day, so I went to a service project with Anita.  It was actually fun, and nice to do something for someone else for a change.  We painted, and sweated a whole bunch.  Apparently the heat index was like 105.

So now I'm off to take a shower.  I think me and Anita might ""take"" Jesus into Rice village for ice cream because it's his birthday.  He'll be driving though because he's the only one with a car...

"event","Well, the internet is back up.  The power went of yesterday when we had this huge thunderstorm and it nocked out the intrnet network.  I didn't realy realize how addicted I had become to facebook until I was deprived of my internet.  
Life's been good the days haven't been terribly exciting; they've mostly been figuring out what classes you are going to take.   We've been pulling ""jacks"" on other colleges at night, so I'm feeling slightly sleep deprived.  Tuesday night (or I guess Wednesday morning because it was like 3), we went over to Jones (our like big rival college) who's O-week theme is Harry Potter week.  We posted fliers all over their hallways that told the ending of the 6th book, and then painted dark marks and various phrases all over all the windows. The next night, they tried to get us back.  I was asleep but my suitemates and some guys stayed up waiting for them filling up water baloons...
Wednesday, we also had Maptek.  Apparently Martel's namesake was Greek, and when you write ""Martel"" in Greek letters, it looks like Maptek.  It was basically a scavenger hunt whose sole purpose was to get you as gross and dirty as possible.  They gave you a clue, you ran to the place, and then you had to do a task.  We played twister with the mat covered in ketchup (on the red dots) chocolate syrup (on the blue dots)  mustard(on the yellow) and relish on the green.  There was one that involved picking up the people on your team, running them to a blow-up pool filled with ketchup, flipping them upside-down, and dunking theyre head in the ketchup.  By the end of the night, I was also covered in shaving cream, oatmeal, spaghetti, and egg...
Last night we had the real full-blown scavenger hunt that was also a lot of fun.  It involved getting random items, people and picturesof people in front of Houston landmarks, etc.  Later last night, or I guess this morning, around 3, we pulled a jack on Brown who was out having their own version of Maptek at the time.  we snuck into the college, went to all of the bathrooms, they have community bathrooms there, unscrewed all the showerheads, and hid them.  I feel so evil :)...
Today I'm registering for classes, and tonight is Houston night out.  You got to pick what you wanted to do, and I'm going clubbing with my roommate, my suitemates, and a group of our friends and other people (including Jordan Davis).
I miss ya'll, and i hope you're having fun!"

Rice is awesome, Martel Rules...
I finally got my internet set up today.  I just had to plug the cable in but there were three cable ports (or whatever you call them) and I tried the 2 that didn't work so gave up.
My roomates are awesome, and so is my group. (They divide you up into groups within your college which you spend a lot of your time with the first week.  I'm in the Tidlywinks Group.)
The best part about Sunday was Matriculation.  All of the colleges dressed up in church clothes and processed across campus to this big auditorium.  We listened to motivational words and then processed again to Rice's Sally Port where we walked under the archway with are college to innitiate us into ice.  There were fireworks and confetti and cheers; it was a lot of fun. 
Yesterday, we learned our cheers and had orientations based on our majors.  I saw Jennifer and Emily Fortuna at the engineering one.  We also processed down to the auditorium again, yelling our cheers at the other colleges and screaming their anti-cheers back at them.  Once in the auditorium, we had to do our ""silent cheers.""  We listened to another speaker then too.  After dinner, we walked around to all of the colleges yelling our anti-cheers for them.  At this point, Jesus drove by in his truck and yelled at me.  I have no idea how he saw me among all the other Martelians in our matching shirts, but oh well.  I left the pack, and talked to him and his roommate for a while.  By this time, my people were gone, and I was tired of walking, so I got in the truck with them and drove around untill I realized that I had to be back for a separated Marticulation ceremony which wouldn't be good to miss.  (Our college has its own Sally Port so we have our own ""procession through the arch""  (I've used that word so many times and I don't even know if I'm spelling it right)  They got lost trying to get me back and ended up at Brown, so I ran back to Martel and got back just in time.  Afterwards, I set up my email and went with my group over to the Weiss ""party"" which was actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be.  Me and my suitemates are pretty crazy dancers :) (so is Jordan Davis).  We left the party to go to house of pies. And got back like 1:15 or so.  I also talked to Cole last night which was very entertaining...
This morning, our advisors woke us up at 7 for a ""mock beer bike"" we painted up and went down to the tennis courts where we had chugging/roley cart races and a giant waterbaloon fight..."

I worked in the afternoon, but not really because it was stormy the whole time.  I played Speed, war, and ERS, as well as Battleship and Guess Who.  We tried to play Risk, but it was like the first version of it, and the rules were different than they are now, so we couldn't figure out how to do it.  Annother guard had brought the Harry Potter book, and I didn't have it yet, so she let me read as far as she had gotten in it, which was only like the first 3 chapters, but it was still good.  Then the other lifeguard there called his dad and got him to bring up a laptop to the pool so that we could watch movies.  We made it about halfway through Bad Boys II when our boss called and told us to close the pool early.  So I got off an hour and a half early, which was nice.  

I also met this guy named Joey who's a lifeguard.  We were talking about Midland, and he was like, do you know a girl named Lindsey Bassam (I'm not exactly sure if that's how you say her last name), and I was like yeah, she used to be in orchestra with me, and she's actually there staying with my friend now.  And he's like yeah, she's my ex girlfriend.  And he's like do you know someone named Brian Ulmschneider, and I was yup and I laughed.  It's a small world.  

Last night, I went over to Jimmy's house and plaed Trivial Persuit Pop Culture Edition.  It was really hard, and I was horrible at it.  It was still pretty fun though...  Oh and I talked to my roomate, too.  She seems really cool.  She lives down by Brownsville, and she said that they were in the Hurricane when she was talking to me.

Today, all I did was work, it thundered again, so we were closed for like the last hour and a half of my shift.  My mom got the Harry Potter book, so I've kinda been reading that.

"event","Ok, finishing up my recap of the last few days, I didn't have time to finish, I had to go to work.
So, after going to the museum yesterday, we went to Freebirds for dinner and then to Jimmys house and played LOTR monopoly b/c we had just seen the exhibit the other day.  One of the twins, Matt, is a LOTR nut, and we made fun of him because he knew what all the names of the characters were and what all of the obscure names went...
More later sorry, i g2g again..."

Past few days:
Yesterday, I worked from 930-3 and it was annoying because for the first time this week it didn't thunder and I had to work untill the last 5 mins when it finally did.
After work, went downtown w/ Jimmy and girlfriend steph, and two of their friends, twins, Matt and Michael.  We went to the Houston Museum of natural science, saw the LOTR exhibit, which was awesome.  Conversation from the museum:
Jimmy:  Look Beth, those are Orlando Blooms tights.  His legs were actually in those tights like a year ago...
Yep, we're a weird bunch.  They have this thing where everytime you see a yellow car while in a car, you yell yellow car and touch the roof.  The last person to touch the roof has to take off an article of clothing.  Well, apparently they did that once, and now its kinda a permanent joke...
They seem pretty tame compared to yall though :) *misses friends*"

Last week was awesome.  Honestly, Synod weeks are like the best weeks of my life, and last week was probably my best Synod week ever.  It's really hard to explain, it's just kinda something that you have to experience to understand.  I'll try to show ya'll pictures when I'm back in Midland if you want.
Friday night I stayed up until 4:40 in the morning, probably a record for me.  I woke up at 7, left U of Tulsa at 8:30 amd was home around 6:00.  That night, I had a social life!!  I rode to Synod with 3 other people:  Meghan, a girl from my church in Midland, Kristen, who got kicked in the face the last night and had to go the the emergency room to get 7 stitches on her lip,  Jimmy, who sat on the floor of one of the dances with me, screaming the words to the Strawberry Wine song while everyone gave us amused looks  (You should try doing that sometime, if you have never experienced it), and me.  Saturday night, I went to a put put like place called Mountasia with Jimmy, his girlfriend, and one of his other friends (I forgot his name, ahhh, I'm so bad at names!)  We mini golfed (I got last), played DDR (I was pretty bad at that too) and this X-Men arcade game.  Surprisingly, I was the only one who didn't die and have to put in annother token during our ""mission"".  I went to bed around midnight and slept untill my alarm went of at noon.  I had breakfast ( a bowl of cereal)  and hung around the house untill 3 when I went to work.  We were closed b/c it was thundering untill around 7, so I played cards and other games w/ the lifeguards until then.  Work was officially over at 9:30, but we had a lifeguard inservice untill 10.  It was ok, we played sharks and minnows, but by the time I got home, I was starving (despite the pieces of cookie cake I had at the inservice).  
Today, I've been reading lj posts, trying to get caught up w/ yalls life.  Right now, I'm about to leave to pick up Mollie at the vet.
Miss ya'll..."

"event","Wow.
I just realized how fast this summer is going.  On Sunday, I'm leaving again for a week to go to ""church camp"" in Tulsa.  It will be kinda strange b/c I'm going w/ people from the church here, the only one which I know being a girl I used to go to church w/ in Midland.  (Sorry that was a long sentance; I'm not sure if it makes sense, but I'm WAY too lazy to change it; it's summer)  After that, I'm home in Houston for about a week and a half, then hopefully back to Midland and ya'll!!!  I don't know how long I'll be able to stay.  If I try to stay a week, I'll only have a little more than a week to get ready for college, which is really scary because I haven't even started yet... Hmmm...  My plan now is to get into Midland on that thursday, but I don't know when I'll leave.  A lot of it depends on ya'll.  Haha, I'm sitting ant Emily's computer, listening to her Texas country music while she's in class. 

One of my favorite songs so far:
When I look south and see the storm clouds roll, 
on their way from old Mexico
don't want to be alone.
The rays of light through my Shiner Bock bottle 
make me wanna turn the key and put down the throttle 
and get lost down 35. 

When I get tied down by the ties that bind 
seems like I'm never gonna find the time
to do what I need. 
That's to find me a place where I can think;
talk about love, laugh, and drink. 
And there's someone there who cares..."

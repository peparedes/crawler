"event","OK here we go again went to Union on wednesday it was great except there was no power so we had to cancel it which sucked but what r ya gonna do!  Blane a worship leader from texas that came up and did some stuff for us sang a couple of songs for the adults and it was really powerful.  Thursday was not that productive at work I was tired and bored GZJV was awesome we had a blast, Blane did worship for us and the youth band got to play with him which was cool and Dylan did an awesome job giving his t-mony(thnx Lace).  Friday, same at work except I got paid which was hot and GZV was awesome same thing with Blane the youth band got to play with him, Went out to eat afterwords which was cool I love hanging out with friends and then went to bed.  Saturday, Went to home depot bought some stuff, then worked on the christmas decorations again and hopefully they are finished now!  Then I went up to see a service at the worship center with C and Blane but we did'nt make it because of traffic and we realized we were hungry instead, so we went to the park city mall and got food and hung out for a little it was fun.  K now it is bed time once again so I will be driving the van for church tomorrow so I will see u cats there if not, then you better come anyway sinner, just kidding bye. Ernie<><"

YUCK, I know right.&nbsp; So I stayed home from school today seeing as I couldn't walk on it, I went and saw a doctor.&nbsp; He told me ""severe sprain"" and that I could possibly be out for like a month, AT THE MOST!&nbsp; That is a little extreme for just a sprained ankle.&nbsp; Probably like a week or two, two at most. We'll see how well it heals. :)&nbsp; I'm going to miss a tourney this weekend :( Go figure.&nbsp; But now I have a softcast on my foot for a week and I also have to wear this HUGE boot so that I don't move it.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and did I mention I get to walk around school w/ crutches! NOOO! I'm going to hate it! YUCK!&nbsp; People babying me and such, I hate it.&nbsp; None of that!&nbsp; Oh well its only tomorrow and Friday, and hopefully I'll be alright for next week. :)</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=5><EM>Well...hello there...just kind of being lame at the moment...posting some song lyrics (if you haven't already noticed), for the hell of it.....well mostly because I'm bored!</EM></FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ccccff size=5>I really need to change my mood towards my game (volleyball) because lately I've been sucking it up. It may be because I keep telling myself how much I suck&nbsp;at middle and keep saying how much I don't like to play that position.&nbsp; If thats the case I really need to just suck it up and play my best. I mean..I'm not going to get to play outside (options arent really open for me at the moment) so I've just got to make the best of it!&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ccccff size=5>It just makes me kind of sad because if I were to play for a college,&nbsp;I DEFINETLY wouldn't be playing the middle position, so its really hard for me to show schools what i can do...while playing the middle position. Ya know. and this year is the ""scouting time"" for me...so it is kind of frustrating.!!!! ah! Oh well...just gotta make the best of it!</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ccccff size=5>plus our team is having some issues at the moment...and coach is getting upset.&nbsp; I totally see where he is coming from, and I myself is getting upset, I totally understand....its just a tough situation sometimes and&nbsp; Ijust want to take a break from it sometimes!</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ccccff size=5>Well I better get some sleep, I actually have to get up tomorrow! YIKES! WEll I'll be around! :)</FONT></EM></P>

I feel like such a loser, and if you knew what it was, you'd probably think I was an idiot, or beat me up (quoted from Jarrod)!! Sometimes I just feel like I have NO CONTROL, and it really makes me angry, to the point that I just breakdown!!!&nbsp; Somedays seem better than others, but thats just how it is!&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like an idiot! This isn't that big of a deal, if you're reading this, don't freak out! This isn't about drugs or alcohol (Drugs are bad...mmmk!), its not really anything to worry about!!!! :)</FONT></P>

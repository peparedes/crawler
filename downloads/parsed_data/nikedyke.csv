"event","Hello to all after an almost two year absence I am back. Life has given me an interesting turn of events over the past two years. I haven't always faced them well, but then again no one is perfect. First I am glad to say that charlottesmts is back in my life. I have missed our time together. She is truly the little sister that I always wished for. She may not be blood family, but she is family in every other sense of the word. I will always wish the very best for her in her life, and I hope that her challenges are never too much for her to handle. I am still with my partner of many years, but I must admit that my heart is not always were it should be to make this relationship work. I have gone through many changes with being bi-polar, including a very severe mania phase while on medication. I see a therapist once a week, a ""shrink"" once a month for med control, and my doctor once a month. Constant blood tests. the meds that I was on made me diabetic, so now I have to watch that too. My liver is now compromised due to the same med. Ended up also getting diagnosed with fibromyalgia.The new med seems to work but it makes me sick every time I take it. Doctor is working on that one. the head ""shrinker"" that I have I don't like. I think that I could get more out of a blow up doll and a tape recorder. (No pun intented here) Linda is still in my life and is always the light and sunshine when I need it. I love her dearly and wish that her life was better. I hope that all of you out in lj land are doing well and that your lives are on the upswing. I am trying to learn not to let life get you down, make the best of bad situations. It is true that every dark cloud has a silver lining. Sometimes you really have to look very hard for it."

Even stripped of<br>exaggerations, Your real life was as dramatic<br>and as tragic as a cautionary tale. Born to an<br>ancient and noble house, you were married<br>(against your wishes) to a middle-class heiress<br>for money, caused scandals with prostitutes and<br>with your sister-in-law, thus enraging your<br>mother-in-law, who had you imprisoned under a<br>lettre de cachet for 14 years until the<br>Revolution freed you. Amphibian, protean,<br>charming, you became a Revolutionary,<br>miraculously escaping the guillotine during the<br>Terror, only to be arrested later for<br>publishing your erotic novels. You spent your<br>final 12 years in the insane asylum at<br>Charenton, where you caused another scandal by<br>directing plays using inmates and professional<br>actors. You died there in 1814, virtually in<br>the arms of your teenage mistress.
You are a revolutionary deviant. I applaud you.

"event","Life is truly a hard job. It is the hardest job that any of us will ever go through. I feel that through the pain we grow. But, damn, why does it always have to be so hard! After rereading and watching ""What dreams may come"", I realize that life is short. To short to be around people who make you miserable. I also believe that each one of us has a soulmate on this planet, and, if we are fortunate enough to actually meet with them, then we are complete. I think that some of us spend our whole life searching, without really knowing what we are searching for. But, then when we find we know. I think that people are meant to come and go from our lives, and, bring something special to that time. When they leave then, we to have been blessed with their presence in our lifes. We are not meant to love just one person our entire lives, but rather many different people for many different reasons. So, for now, I am currently at rest, within myself. I need to time to heal and regroup. Who knows what lies in the future for me, and for now, I am tired. Tired of fighting the battles and waging the wars. Now is the time for be just to be quiet and listen."

"event","Today i showed my mom my report card and she got mad at me for an 83 in math!!!!   She keeps on telling me that ""i can do better than that"" and stuff like that, so my question to her is do u really think that if i could do better than i wouldnt?,    which is basicly what shes saying...  o well


Science and french quizes tomorrow dont thin either will be that bad but im actually gonna study a little tonight

Orchestra was... ... fun because my bass wasnt there and is P.O.W. ooooppppppssss i mean M.I.A..   instead of playing i just did my math and french homework with rishi sitting next to me.   Apparently my bass is lost or acccidently sitting in the parker orchestra room, but im fine with that cuz it means i can slack off with an excuse.

"event","Today i was different and actually did my homework when i got home...  now i face a boring night, but im waiting for csi.  Thats truly a great show!! 
school was same as always and boring.  Tommorrow i believe i get to skip L.A. second-to-last period so i can practice in the orchestra witht the 6th graders.   it will be our last practice before tanglewood.

      The other day i was talking to people in swimming about mr edgecomb and him being himself.  then my 24 year old coach went ""u mean the 8th grade teacher??  I had him""  she went on to say he was ""weird"" and ""annoying with 'those stories'"".  Then i asked about Mr. sargent to see if she remembered him.  I said the name, she thought about it, then she said ""was he the pysicotic war guy?"" . Apparently she remembered both of them lol.  That was the greatest part of my day!!
   im  gonna go see if theres anything on t.v. so...

"event","Today at practice we had a few sets that should be easy to swim but im so out of shape they were somewhat tiring. for instance we had 8x50s on 50 seconds, and i was barely making them.

     Today in history we went to the computer lab to set up our email accounts.  Ms. tada (no kidding thats her name!) must of been in a bad mood because she yelled at Mikey for doing what he was supposed to do. o well
      Sunday im going to Tanglewood with the orchestra. Should be fun. we get a comfy-ish coach bus to take us there, so it should be a  lot of fun.  just hope i dont mess up  lol.    
other than that im happy with my L.A. midterm (89).  Also i got a 92 on the very easy french quiz, and all my mistakes were stupid(like forgetting ""e""'s and stuff like that) 
    I gotta go eat so i can do my hw.

"event","Let's see.  today i went the malones' for pats sisters confirmation party. twas lots of fun. we basically ate in the rain and played basketball even though we were all dressed up. I stole pats gum and had him convinced that i didnt have it in my pocket then i flashed it in front of him(kinda confused the hell out of him).  Then i came home and did my pile of homework.  Then i sat there and was bored.  The ni decided i needed ice cream so i convinced my parents that they wanted to take me to kimballs.  then i came home again, and now ifind myself bored.


   yesterday i got up at like 4 fuckin 30  and got dressed to go deep sea fishing with a group of my uncles friends and theyr kids. my uncle chartered a boat and filled it with people. it left from gloucester(cape ann) at 6. when we finally got to the spot in the middle of nowhere on the ocean the fishing was so/so.  There were rather large size restrictions tho. haddock had to be 19 in.  cod had to be 22 in.I caught about 5, and had to throw 2 back.  IT WAS REALLY YUMMY FOR DINNER THO

"event","Not too much is new.  Today my heart felt funny in science and it was pretty weird :/.  I had a dentist appointment and got elastics for my braces. 
     Vacation was awesome,  theres always something to do in 'Zona. The London Bridge looks so out of place there.  It actually came from london and was flown to Arizona in sections by plane or something like that.
     Pat, Keith, and I had a great time relaxing and playing around at the pool.  We went to the local pool/recreation center. That was pretty cool.  It had a wave pool, a hot tub, and a 3 floor ""pipeline"".  It also had one of those mushrooms that pour water over the edges( i think most people have seen those right??)  Other than that Vegas was great.  The bright lights on the strip burned!  Definatly a completly different culture then ours.  Good times all around.

"event","hey.  havent updated in a while. Todays a day off which has been ok so far.  It;'s consisted of cleaning the garbage dump  , i mean room  ,  going to the safety deposit box with mum and missing some hoops in the driveway. Later on im going to starsky and hutch with tim.   Other than that its been a really plain day.
   ONE WEEK till vacation brings me something to look forward to , and im dying to go. Arizona with keith AND pat is gonna be sweet. not to mentio the fact that for most of the day we're on our own whihch makes it even sweeter.  We'll most likely go kart, play videogames, roll quarters downa hill (dont ask) and go to the indoor water park thatr has a three story spiral slide. On the way to Arizona we're flying to Las Vegas getting there at like 11 pm (about the equivalent to our 2 am) . we'll go to a hotel, get up early and start the about 3.5 hour drive through absolutly nothing except desert cactus and funny golfball shaped houses( no im not kidding).  The best part of the ride is where there were dunes that they paved right over, so its a section of camel hump-like dips, that when driven over with your eyes closed gives u the sensation that your stomach is in your mouth. Then you finally get into denser annd denser civilization until you are in Lake Havasu City, Arizona!!!.  
   Ill bring along my camera and if there's anything good to tape ill do my best to put it on a website.  
I gotta go do some wash and take a shower(yes cuz im stinky) so i'll ttyl

"event","Over all today was a boring, regular, bland day. yesterday was greatbecause i went scuba diving. If  you have any interest you sould seriously try it because its seriously amazing. Once you get under water its just unexplainable knowing that you have faced the water and stayed under the water but managed to defy its tendency to drown people. If you dont think its safe listen to this: Theres statistically more af a chance of getting hurt bowling then there is s.c.u.b.a. diving.  I did a beginner course and it really inspired me so i am really trying to get my parents to let me get certified for open water diving, which means you canb go in the ocean and places like that. For me this would be cool cuz i have an uncle tht scuba dives and lives on nantucket so i could go visit him and he could help me out and take me to some good spots, like wrecks or something like that.
     MICCAs are sunday /:.  im not too sure that i want to go but i kinda have to. last year we got a gold and this year im guessing that we wont do as good cuz we had a bunch of really good 8th graders, but they've moved on to the high school.  Next year ive decided to drop orchestra, just cuz i really dont have a desire to do it.  Good enough reason right?
     I'd really love any sggestions for video clips or movies to make and then display on a website. The emails nperkins214@hotmail.com    please write!!

    I've decided instead of hating my nickname ""perky"" ill embrace it and support it. Its noth that bad ... i guess. 

   Well i gotta go finish up the homework , including the science note book

"event","i just got back from my vacationwith keith in florida. we stayed in a sweet ass ""villa"" where we were kickin back on huge leather couches watching the fifty freakin two inch tv. thats right 52 inch. we decided to scratch seaworld cuz lets think about it: we had a resort to relax at for the day or we could go to a theme park that was bound to smell like fish. that decision wasnt too hard. 
the first park we went to was disney. we chose to go to the magic kingdom sectioon cuz it has the well known rides like the mountain series ( splash<-- didn't do cuz it was actually to cold, big thunder, space) we did those and the pirates ride. then we froze r b hinds off and went to ther monorail and waited for our ride to come.
 then the next day we did universal, and chose to go to islands of adventure cuz it has the rollercoasters (hulk, deuling dragons) they were pretty sweet roller coasters too. then weds. to fri. we went to my grandparents summer place down in florida and enjoyed the pool shuffleboard, and bacci, along with biking(including the evil purple bike). It was great because u need to be 55or over to live their so it was all old people that could barely walk so they use golf carts. about half of the people there had the carts so i was trying to convince my grandparents they needed one. (golf carts are a way of life and also a neccesity of life). thats right if u havent driven a golf cart then u havent become aliveyet. yea u heard me. other than that we just relaxed and slept so i would give this trip a grade of A/A+."

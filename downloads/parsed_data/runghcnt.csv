You scored 93% Beginner, 93% Intermediate, 93% Advanced, and 66% Expert!  
You have an extremely good understanding of beginner, intermediate, and advanced level commonly confused English words, getting at least 75% of each of these three levels' questions correct. This is an exceptional score. Remember, these are commonly confused English words, which means most people don't use them properly. You got an extremely respectable score.

"event","It's a long, long journey
Till I know where i'm supposed to be
It's a long, long journey
and I don't know if I can believe
When shadows fall and block my eyes
I am lost and know that I must hide
It's a long, long journey
Till I find my way home to you

Many days I've spent
Drifting on through empty shores
Wondering what's my purpose
Wondering how to make me strong
I know I will falter I know I will cry
I know you'll be standing by my side
It's a long, long journey
And I need to be close to you

Sometimes it seems no one understands
I don't even know why
I do the things I do
When pride builds me up till I can't see my soul
Will you break down these walls and pull me through?

'Cause it's a long, long journey
Till I feel that I am worth the price
You paid the price for me on calvary
Beneath the stormy skies
When Satan mocks and friends turn to foes
It feels like everything is out to make me lose control
It's a long, long journey
Till I find my way home to you

"event","When my mum told me she had free tickets to Alegria, the new show from circus de soleil, i was stunned...how come?? later she told me her friend (Mr Yun)'s daughter is the only singaporean to work in the circus de soliel and they went to the premiere of the show together...she said she meet lots of our local ""stars"" from both TV stations...so envious...thats not all...she also got to explore the circus the day before...meeting all the performers and stuff...the cooks there even prepared a meal for them...The most fun part was that on Chinese new year, miss Yun invited ALL the performers to her house to eat dinner and everybody was there...including my mum and others (mahjong kaki's lah)....ARGHH!!! why didnt i say yes when she asked me to go??
(note: she didnt tell me about the ENTIRE circus being invited too)...*sobs*...i wanna meet the dancer babes...

As a consolation, miss yun said she would give me free tickets to the show...hehe

   The show started at about 8pm and i was nearly late cos i was playing games at jz's house before that..didnt even have time for dinner..*sobs*...anyway, I was sitting in the 4th row from the front so the view was very clear...Before the show started, the clowns were walking around, disturbing the people coming in...there was this one clown carrying a huge luggage bag walking around looking like he was lost...haha...then he sat down beside this fat guy and started showing him stuff from his luggage...haha..hilarious!! 
    The show started off with all of the performers running out and waving to the people, sort of like a teaser..then came the clowns to warm up the audience for abit...then came(not in order, cos i cant remember which ones came first) the fire-juggler sort of guy, dancers in weird costumes, acrobats(there were dozens of them) doing somersaults flips and other acrobatish thingies, the strong man who can bend bars and lift tremendous weights, 2 female contortionists who could use their butts to touch their heads, the lead singer whose voice is like the most beautiful thing ever, musicians, and on and on...The thing about this circus is it has a very theaterish feel to it....the music and the costumes they use are unique and i just loved the show and i wished i could go tour the world with them!!!"

"event","""Where are we, Master?"" I asked the wizard. He stood behind me as I stared up at the sign. 

""We are here,"" the wizard replied. 

""So, in which direction shall we head?"" I stared up at it for a long time, the word was as obscure as any word could be. 

""What does the sign suggest?"" the wizard asked. 

Painted on the face of a solid looking piece of wood was the word 'Nowhere'. Arrows sprouted from both sides of the word, indicating it could be found in either direction. 

""It does not suggest anything, Master,"" I turned to him. ""It directs."" 

""Then which way does it direct us, my pupil?"" He was smiling. 

I looked off to the left, and saw nothing. For as far as the eye could see, there was nothing. Even the ground on which we stood was void of color. We were standing in a field of white and grey, a sea of nothingness, and the test had only just begun. 

""It indicates that we may travel either right or left and still arrive at our destination."" 

The wizard raised an eyebrow, ""Ahh."" 

""How can this be possible?"" 

""Perhaps we should follow the sign's enigmatic direction?"" the wizard suggested. 

I agreed and made to take a step, but could not decide in which direction to let my boot fall. I stared up at the sign in bewilderment, my foot raised in the air like a child playing hop-stones, scratching my dull witted head. 

We were going Nowhere, fast. 

""Perhaps I should decide in which direction our tread shall fall?"" the wizard said after an eternity of my indecision. He wore a discontented expression, and I was suddenly embarrassed. 

""Nay, Master, I shall decide, for what does it matter which direction I choose?"" 

The wizard's eyes came alight with pride and I heard whispers of approval from all around me; hushed, as though caught on a hint of a breeze. 

We began our journey immediately, and I took the lead. The ground upon which we strode was solid feeling, though like no other ground I'd ever traversed. My perception was not as strong here, for this place was disorienting. Everywhere was nothing; nothing was everywhere. It began to weigh on me and my steps faltered. 

""Why do you slow?"" the wizard asked from behind. 

I halted and spun, ""I cannot tell if we are traveling in the right direction,"" I said. ""My senses are off here for there is nothing to indicate where we are going or where we have been. I have tried to keep my feet falling in a straight line, but in this place, does 'straight' even have meaning?"" 

The wizard raised an eyebrow and the whispers of approval sounded around me again. Only after I heard them did I realize that by voicing the question, I'd discovered the answer. 

I smiled back at the wizard, then turned around and continued the journey. After a while there was a speck ahead of us, a black dot on the white and grey horizon. As we approached, it became clear that it was another sign. Once I'd realized that, I was eager to see if we had come to our destination. 

The word was there, in the same place it had been before. 

<-Nowhere-> 

It seemed as far away as ever. 

""What does this mean?"" 

""Do you seek an answer to that question?"" the wizard asked, and the whispers became mutters of disapproval. 


""No, Master, I do not."" My eyes remained on 'Nowhere.' ""I am simply being free with my inner dialogue."" I shook my head in disgust. ""This word taunts me. This place hides from me."" 

The wizard raised his eyebrows once again, a crooked finger followed, ""Is the place hiding from you, or are you hiding from it, I wonder?"" 

I thought about that as we began our journey again. I could not be more open in my desire to find Nowhere, so I could not be hiding from it. Not consciously, anyway. Nowhere was proving to be tougher to find than I'd anticipated. It was as elusive as a dream lost between consciousness and repose, always on the fringe of the mind, flirting shamelessly with total recall, yet never completely recovered or remembered. 

However, Nowhere seemed to be everywhere. The void was gnawing at my thoughts. Every step I put in front of the next, brought me closer to Nowhere than the last. 

Or did it? 

""Speak to me, Master,"" I said after a while. My ears longed to hear the sound of a human voice in that empty place. 

""I may not speak simply to ease your loneliness, it is not allowed."" There was a moment of silence and then the wizard sighed, "" I'm afraid that this is the last you will hear of my voice for the duration of the test."" 

I blinked in surprise and swooned when I realized the consequences of my words. The test had just become much harder than before. 

I came upon the third sign hoping the word would be the same, but the arrows would be missing- they were not. <-Nowhere-> watched me watch it and I shivered in frustration. 

The whispers were there again, surrounding me with doubt. The voices, mingled and nondescript before, were each distinct in their displeasure now. I felt as though my time was running out. 

I looked out from under the sign, off in one of the directions it wanted me to go, and pondered the journey thus far. Upon my entry into the test, the Elders had encumbered me with but one task: _Arrive at your destination._ 

It was much easier sounding than going. My destination was a place that does not exist. Nowhere was to the right, and Nowhere was to the left, and I am here. 

We are here. 

The words the wizard had spoken in answer to my first question, ""Where are we?"" suddenly reverberated through my head. 

_We are here._ 

The whispers became silent, and I knew my delving thoughts had just tasted the outer crust of pay-dirt. 

I looked at the wizard and smiled, ""I could walk for days and months and never find this 'Nowhere,"" isn't that true, Master?"" 

The wizard said nothing, as the whispered voices said nothing. I, however, found it difficult to hold my tongue. 

""Nowhere was never my destination. I just assumed it to be because of the sign."" 

The whispers did sound then, mingled as before. The wizard was staring off in silence, his eyes unfocused, indicating he was taking part in that whispered conversation. 

After a moment he shook his head as his mind rejoined me here in the void. ""I have been allowed to speak to you again for you have come to the crossroads."" 

""I have come to no crossroads. There are no crossroads here."" 

""So then where are we?"" the wizard asked, his eyes were alight with intensity. 


""We are here,"" I said. 

""And where is here?"" 

I smiled, ""Here is Somewhere."" 

The whispers grew loud, the Elders were excited. The wizard stared at me with his arms crossed, however, waiting for more. 

""This sign is not for following,"" I said in compliance, ""it is simply here as reference. It exists to let me know where I am."" 

""And where are you?"" he asked once again. 

""I am here. I am in the middle of Nowhere."" 

He smiled, ""And just a moment ago you said you were somewhere."" 

""I am both at the same time."" 

""And how is that possible?"" 

My smile widened as the idea became clear in my head, ""It is possible to be in the middle of Nowhere, and call it somewhere, because I . . . am . . . here. Nowhere becomes somewhere because of my presence. Because of me."" 

""And what about when we leave this place behind, and somewhere becomes Nowhere again?"" 

""That will not happen, Master."" I told him. 

""Why not?"" 

""Because I shall always remember this place, as shall you, and all others who've ever taken this test. Nowhere is somewhere because we were here. And wherever we are, it is with us."" 

The wizard smiled and spread his arms out to the sides. ""My pupil, you have passed the test."" 

The whispers in my head became shouts of congratulations, and I smiled in satisfaction 

One thought tickled the corners of my mind as the wizard cast the Portal spell that would lead us to the real world. I put my hand on his shoulder when his conjuring had ceased, and said, matter-of-factly, ""If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it . . . it doesn't make a sound, does it."" 

The wizard crooked an eyebrow and asked, before stepping into the Portal and disappearing, ""What do you think?"" 

The End"

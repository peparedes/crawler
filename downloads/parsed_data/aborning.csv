take the wheel and straighten out my life for me?
there's a deaf and blind soldier's ghost hitchiking for you and me,
but it doesn't really matter if we're just as handicapped.
you have the smoothest hands i've ever touched,
and it's not fair that i can't hold them for very long.
this sunset's drying up quickly, and lashing out for maturity.
it can take all of mine, i don't care.
i've seen twice the sadness as someone twice my age.
are you hungry or tired?
i'm wide awake like a gunshot.
like a bang bang gunshot. 
i'm so glad that you're here,
because you have the softest hands i've ever touched."

"event","all of this? is fake. i'm not happy at all. 
i think there's something wrong with me, because i really honestly don't like anyone except for maybe four people. someone came up to me at the record store and said hi and complimented something about me, and i just gave them this look of total ""fuck you"". i dont know what's wrong with me. i've become an aggressive driver too.
i hate talking to friends in ohio, people i use to talk to and see all the time, and them telling me about their life. i dont like hearing how great they're doing without me. it makes me feel like a used t-shirt or something. maybe i should just stop using aim. maybe i should just throw away my phone. maybe i should just change my name. maybe i should just fuck off and die. maybe i should comit myself. go on pills. get a labotomy. i don't know. maybe i do need friends. i don't see anyone, it's just me everyday all day. 
i cry myself to sleep everynight, did you know that? did you fucking know that?
everytime my dad tells me about something STUPID that has happened in the world, it just makes me so angry that i start shaking.
why am i pathetic. why does anyone like me. i'm drinking again. i had a beer this morning. when i woke up. what the fuck is wrong with me. my art is so shitty, who am i kidding. there's so much shit i want to say to so many people, but i'm either too lazy/scared/stupid to say something. i want to do all this stuff with my zine, and my art, and this board comic, and greeting cards, but at the same time i just want to go to sleep and never wake up. im sick of horrible movies. i'm sick of horrible bands. im sick of fake people. im sick of seeing stupid fake scenesters from toledo on myspace and people being friends with them. they don't deserve friends. theyre morons. i dont give a shit if im stupid for saying that, because im right. everyones stupid. im stupid. fuck me. i have no sexual desires anymore. im just a fucking robot with nothing. i am nothing. i hate myself. why am i ugly, why am i fat. why do i hate everything. why cant i just be cheerful. why are people so lousy. why am i even fucking breathing. why am i complaining. im fucking rich off my stupid art. it doesnt make me happy anyway. who cares. i should just shut up. im like a wet kleenex. you can blow on them, and they'd break in half so easily, and it feels like my mind is doing that. there's holes in my head and i dont even know if i want to fix them. i havent hugged another person in weeks, and it feels like im slowly just dissapearing and i want to just touch someone. i want to touch someone i want to touch someone i want to touch someone. please, god. I JUST WANT TO FEEL SOMETHING.

<font size=20><b>WHY CAN'T I JUST FUCKING DIE</b></font>
and i just miss you so bad. i miss you so bad it scares me, because i don't think ive ever missed someone as much as this. and i get angry, and i get sad, and i get happy when i talk to you, and its like explosions on fast foward inside my head and i can't slow it down. and the only thing that i want to do right now is be in the middle of nowheresville, iowa pumping gas in the middle of the morning. ive forgotten so many things about myself that i don't know if i'm even sane anymore. i have no grasp of anything, and im so isolated."

"event","im sick of everything.
rash on my god damn face, my mom bitching at me all day, and then someone ditching me, and then no one fucking called me tonight like they said they would.
ive lost faith in everything. why do i even try to talk to people. why do i even have hope to make friends. i'm better off by myself with my shitty music. im moving to europe or fucking antartica or something.

Pffft. Silly Allison. I forgot this was solely an Art journal. So here's some fucking art.

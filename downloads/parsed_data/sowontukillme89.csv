"event","So ive decided Im sick of people trying to create images for themselves. I mean, why cant people just wear and act and do their makeup the way they want to?!?!? why do they go shopping and be like ""oh well im going to get this shirt only cuz itll make me look punk rock and thats whats IN right now"" ITS SO GAY!! i mean, i get up in the mornings, put on a tee shirt, some jeans, comfy shoes that range from adidas to vans to chucks and put my hair in a mohawk. And i do it cuz i like it, not jus cuz i want to look a certain style of genre that day. LABELS ARE GAY!!! oh im sorry i just felt like ranting about that for aminute

So anyway, tonight me and some peeps are going to Joyrides for some ""haunted"" activities should be fun indeed. Im excited i guess. i really want a certain someone to come with us, but im too scared to call him...haha. im such a freak. i know. Im kinda hungry. im getting picked up at like 7 30 and i need to eat something before then, im just not sure what...hmm maybe cheezy brocoli rice? hmm es possiblamente...haha. Ok im out. peace out yo. ha"

AAAAHHH. but no, not any normal doctor who weighs you and takes your temperature, no. Its the doctor that plays 21 questions with you to find out if you medication is working. (Yes, for those of you who dont know, i have depression, anxiety and minor insomnia....So im on a little bit of medication for it.) but anyway...i hate going to this doctor cuz whenever i go there i feel wierd cuz in the waiting room theres always these really wierded out crazy kids and its really sad but it makes me uncomftorable all at the same time. but anyway. so i was watching some show about reuniting this lil girl with her dad...and it made me think about my dad. i dont know my dad watsoever, i mean i havent seen him since i was 1. And i wonder, does he even remember that he has a daughter whos almost 16? Hmm. i mean i dont know him so its not like i cry everyday cuz i miss him. It just kinda hurts cuz he didnt even bother to try and find me. Oh well. who cares its just life. well im ""need to get off the computer"" so yeah. later yall. thus concludes my thoughts of right now..lol"

So today was pretty boring...Ive sat around...but its cool im always out with people so its nice when i can have a day to just hang around and do nothing. It was cool, i did a few cool sketches. ok i will admit it, i think that ""helena"" (MCR) is absolutely beautiful. i dont care if shes pale and dead shes gorgeous. well, you know in the video when she like comes back to life or whatever and she kinda just gasps in a breath of air and opens her eyes? well i thought that in that shot, the eyes are amazing! so i sketched it. and it looks cool.Ive been in my pajamas all day..HECK YES. i am too cool. so its like 7 45. and nothing is on tv. except some wierd mom switch show? hah who knows. Im so glad i started going back to church...I mean for a while i just gave up on trying to find a church that just understood me and wasnt judgemental of me...ANd then i found one! and its awesome. i love my youth group to death...theyre amazing. theyre so understanding, and they dont judge me for the things that i have done. and thats awesome. when i first started going i was afraid that it would be really clique-y but its not..i mean everyone talks to everyone and hangs out with everyone its great ness...well ok i guess im done...byebye you sexy people you <3"

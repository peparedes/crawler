The people that would be interested in what's happening are folks I talk to all the time.  So....I won't be updating anymore.  That's one less thing off my list that I don't need to worry about.  Cleaning, cooking, general upkeep of our lives, and saving for a house and normal life things is taking precedence over a weblog.  Good luck to you all, and peace out."

"event","Yes.  I know.  Long time no see.  I have been far too busy to post lately, and the only reason I have time now is because I'm waiting on a phone call from Steve letting me know when the guy is coming to fix the dishwasher.  The guy was here earlier to fix the hot water heater, and it turns out they have to replace it.  So that's cool that the landlord gets to take care of that.  Got the gardening done, mostly.  Now all that's left to do is to clean out the lilacs, and transplant the columbine to a better location.  I worked my butt off yesterday, and have the sunburn to prove it.  Thank god it's starting to cool down a bit.  

Oh!  I turned 27 on Monday, June 5th.  Yay me!  Steve got me a printer doc for my digital camera.  The pics that come off that thing are sweet!  Mom and Dad got us a tent with the mesh sides so we can sit outside at night if we want without being eaten alive.  The grill, however, from Marcy and John was not so great.  We're trashing it as a lost cause, considering we can't even get the thing back together, and the parts we'd have to order for it would be about half of a payment for a new grill.  So...we're scrapping it.  

Anyhoo, have to get going...lots to do, and so little vacation time left!"

I've been working on getting my gardening started, working, and running around doing all sorts of sociable type stuff.  I forget when the last time I talked to my parents was...hmm.  Perhaps a call is in order.  

Oh!  Last night Steve's band opened up for Steve Azar....a country star, if ya didn't know.  I got to stand BEHIND the rope.  Yup.  He and his two bandmates were really cool, and we got great pics, and if I could recall how to post them here, I would.  I was up far too late last night, and had to get up for work this morning.  Tomorrow morning is another early one because my friend Marcy and I are doing a walk for asthma, so that should be cool.  Sunday we're getting together with Marcy and John for dinner or something, and then the week starts all over again.  Yay!  I still have to get a spade and mulch and stuff for the garden.  Hell, I still have to dig the front gardens out...heh!  

Well.  Anyhoo. I'm gonna go play with my new mp3 player.  Back to your regularly scheduled programs."

I have plans for the gardening, even though we're only renting the place.  I want to take care of the lawn like it were my own, mostly because I want to get into the habit of having to do the work.  I don't want to sit here, not doing anything for the upkeep of the house, just because we're renting, not paying a mortgage.  We have been house looking, though.  Steve and I think that in about a year, we can have our bills paid down, and some money saved for a down payment on a little house in a town not too far from here, or his job.  It would about midway for both of us.  

I'm tired of not having any money.  I just wish I could pay everything now, and have my money that I work hard for in the bank, working for me.  Oh well.  Can't have everything.  Gotta run...have to call my dad to see if he can come fix our dishwasher.  Oh yeah...that's another reason we want to move ASAP.

Things are starting to pop up in the yard.  Since this is the first spring we've been renting this little house, it's been interesting to see what's going on.  The landlord had a company come in and take the big maple out of the front yard, since it was dying, so the yard looks bare now.  The house looks dirty and empty, too.  We're going to get a power washer and spray the house down, and I'm starting on yard work.  Nothing fancy, just trying to clean a few things up.  I also told Steve we need a new mailbox, since ours is all rusty and the mail gets wet when it rains, and I want flower boxes to put under the windows in the front of the house.  It needs something, ya know?

I'm going to run to Home Depot and get a rake, and maybe some pruners today, and start my great cleanup project.  I'm tired of the landlord basically mowing the grass, and that's it.  After the lilacs bloom, I'm asking my mother to come over and help me start clearing out the dead wood.  Things have been neglected for so long that they aren't healthy anymore.  Ron (the landlord) is redoing the roof this summer now that the tree's gone, thank god.  The rest of the yard will just take time.  So.  Enough for now...I'm going to get my rake, and do some yard work and cleaning and laundry.  Later gators."

"event","I have to go grocery shopping by my lonesome today.  Steve has to work, so he's gone, and won't be back until 11pm.  Poop.

So, I know this ""Steve"" thing is new, considering before finding this journal again I was still living at home and sans boyfriend.  So I'll give a little background.  Around March of last year, I was really tired of being alone, and really tired of having people try and fix me up, and really tired of the shithead Ron that I was ""seeing."" (that was his word, not mine.)  Ron was a terrible person in my life, that taught me exactly what I DIDN'T want in a man.  Since I've always known what I wanted, I'm not totally sure why I settled for so long, either.  Anyhoo.  A friend of mine at work had gone on eharmony, and while she hadn't met the person of her dreams, she strongly suggested trying it.  So, I did.  A week later, Steve messaged me.  We talked via email for a couple of weeks, then exchanged phone numbers, and started talking on the phone.  Around that time is when my friend Marcy realized she knew him from being his sister's friend for like, 10 years.  Crazy world, lemme tell you.  So, about a month after meeting and talking, we decided to actually physically meet.  It was April 13th, 2005 that my life changed forever.  We haven't been apart since.  My family and friends LOVE him to death, and my parents crack jokes all the time about grandkids and marriage, because they just KNOW.  I know too.  He told me he loved me three weeks after we were dating, and about another week after that, we decided to see eachother exclusively, not that we'd been seeing anyone else, anyway.  I moved in with him last September, which was about 6 months after meeting him, and we're planning on the forever thing.  Sometimes it's hard to wait for him to ask, because I'm so ready to begin our lives as hubbie and girl, but...waiting is okay.  When something is worth it, one waits.  So, I wait.  ;)  Our one year anniversary is in a few weeks, and while I'm not expecting the ring, I know that it's not far down the road.  So. He's 34, a drummer/all around musician/exceptional singer, works security at our friendly local nuclear power plant, and is the most hysterical human being I've ever met.  He's messy and disorganized, and completely laid back, which balances me out quite nicely.  Fundamentally, however, I know we're perfectly matched.  Example:  One day, we were in the mall, and there were these pre-pubescent girls ahead of us.  They headed into Victoria's Secret, not that they had anything to fit into those clothes, and Steve and I looked at eachother and said, at the same time, ""There is no way our kids will go in there until they're 16.""  And then we laughed our asses off.  Stuff like that happens all the time.  We finish eachother's stories and sentences, know what we're thinking before we think it, and totally have the same ideas about kids and marriage and future.  My old supervisor's prediction came true.  She told me, after a particularly hard day of dealing with Ron, that she was totally confident that I would find someone that was absolutely perfect for me.  And, I did.  Peeps, if you doubt, try eharmony for yourselves.  It works if you're honest about yourself, and what you want.

"event","Living with someone is an amazing thing.  Steve and I ordered our elliptical machine today.  We are both far too overweight for our own good, like...to the point that I changed three times last night before his gig because I couldn't find anything in the millions of articles of clothing I own that didn't show my fat rolls.  I used to take pride in what I wore when I went out, and last night I wore an old Gap tshirt and my hiking shoes.  I've just been so damned uncomfortable with myself that it makes me cranky.  My friend Amy and her husband went to see a nutritionist because our insurance at work covers 4 visits a year, and she gave me her name.  I'm going to be making an appointment ASAP.  Steve doesn't seem to be fazed by his weight, and I worry somethin fierce about him.  But, the elliptical will be delivered in 2-7 business days, and it was a whole lot cheaper than it was when we were looking in the store.  I guess waiting for that New Year's fitness rush to pass paid off.  

In other news, I posted my first homework for my College Math for Business class tonight.  I have to say I'm not pleased with my quality of work lately.  It's just that I'm so damned tired.  Last night Steve had a show, and a crapload of his coworkers were there, so a good time was had by all, and we didn't get home after he broke down his drums until about 3am.  Then I had to wake up at 8am to get ready for Steve's sister's baby shower at 10:30 in the morning.  Who has a baby shower that early???  EEsh!  Anyhoo.

I came home, started putzing around on the net, and found out not only had my federal tax return been deposited, but my state one had too.  Miracle of miracles!!  I paid off my computer through Dell(unholy bastards who like to charge 30% interest on the purchase of a computer, but I fixed them and paid it off and am closing my Dell account, like, forever.  Nyah!!)  Then Steve and I paid all our bills, and since his federal return came in too, we bought the elliptical.  I cannot WAIT to be able to work out in any weather, because my current location doesn't really provide for a safe run if I wanted to go at night.  Scary!  I can't wait to start paying my debt off, so we can start stashing the money away for a house.  I'd like to be out of this place as soon as humanly possible, because it would be nice to be homeowners.  

I just realized something.  I rediscovered this journal the other day, and read all my past entries, and am FLOORED at how different my life is.  In just a few short years, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING has changed.  Blows my hair back, I tell ya.  Enough for now, I'm just ramblin'.  Night."

"event","His name is Jason.  The situation surrounding our introduction is complicated, and odd, but...we've met.  I'm finally at a comfortable spot with the situation now, so I can write about it.  

There's this new girl at work named Kelly.  She and Jason transferred to our branch at work from Dallas.  I didn't know this until recently, but they were engaged, and had been together for 2 1/2 years.  There were problems in their relationship starting in the last year of them being together, stemming from her.  5 months before the wedding, she broke off the engagement.  3 months before they came to Rochester, she broke things off completely.  He says he's alright with this, and that they're friends, but I know better.  He's still working through issues.  So they hang out, and go to lunch together, and sometimes carpool together.  They don't live together, and she wants to go out and do the single thing, and find someone else.  We've talked about it.  Me with Kelly, and me with Jason.  Kelly wants to have fun, and find who she wants.  Jason told me that he's just not what Kelly wants.  Stupid girl, for giving up that man, but, I'm not complaining.  They both transferred here for job advancement.  So, one day, I was talking to a woman in another department, and Jason stopped by to talk with her for a second.  I recognized him from seeing him at lunch with Kelly a few times, and told Kelly he had a nice smile.  It was an innocent comment, just to sort of break the ice in conversation with her.  She immediately started talking about introducing us.  Some people have mentioned that since she's so willing to move on, maybe she was excited at the chance to have him hang out with someone else for once since the move.  Again, if that's the case, yay for me.  I told her, laughingly, that I'd think about it.  By the time I got back to my desk, however, she'd already emailed me, and told me she'd told him that someone thought he was cute.  I went back over, laughing, and she told me to check my email again.  Thus began our email conversation, that went very well, and led to a three hour conversation on the phone after work one night.  We made plans to hang out, and he came to visit me the next day at work, and we spent Friday night hanging out at Applebee's, just talking.  It went well, and we were supposed to get together for my 25th b-day, but....he didn't call.  He called Sunday to explain what had happened, and said he would call me later that night to get together.  Again, no call.  By this time I'm upset, despite my ideas about going into this for a new friend, not to push someone into something so soon after losing his fiancee.  But irrational as I am, I was slightly devestated.  Monday comes, and the emails are less frequent, but he calls out of the blue Monday night, sounding upset.  We talk a bit, but his sister from Texas calls, so he goes.  I email Tuesday to let him know that he can call when he needs someone to talk to, but I feel like he's pulling back and feeling pushed.  He's also visiting Kelly a couple times a day, and calling and going to lunch with her.  That made me feel worse, despite my attempts to convince myself that I'm just going for friendship.  I can go a bit overboard, trying to impress new friends.  Even my mother tells me I wear my heart on my sleeve.  

Wednesday, I'm really upset, having only a couple emails from him, and I go home, feeling terrible.  My friend Jamie calls, and we talk about it.  She raises the possibility that the reason he backed off so quickly is because he liked me, and is still having issues handling the breakup.  I'd be gunshy too, if something like that had happened to me.  Hell, I haven't dated anyone since Bob cheated on me.  She also suggested that I back off myself.  So....no emails, no calls, nothing, for two days.  That might not seem like a long time, but for someone like me, who's used to calling people up if I want to hang out or talk, it was hard.  

I wasn't planning on hearing from him again, at least not for a while.  I was supposed to go out with Larry on Friday night, but by 10pm he hadn't called.  I was getting a bit frustrated when the phone rang.  It was Jason. I told him I was a bit surprised that he called, and he asked, ""Why...because we haven't talked in two days?"" I had been sure he hadn't taken much notice of not getting any emails or calls from me.  Guess I was wrong. He had been out with some folks from work, but was heading home.  He said since it was so early on a Friday night, he didn't want to just go home.  So I met him in the parking lot of his apartment complex, picked him up, and we went out.  We spent another 3 hours talking, then I drove him back home, and ended up spending another hour watching TV and talking.  I met his two guinea pigs, and when I left, he walked me down to the door, and we hugged.  A nice hug, not too gropy, but not just a pat on the back, either.  We said we'd talk to eachother later, and I'm sure we will.  We haven't yet, and I'm much more comfortable with that than I was.  I just have to give him some time, and space.  I don't want to be a rebound, and I don't want to shove him away and sabotage this like I've done in the past.  So.  We shall see."

I might have talked a lot, but fuck if he just...stopped listening.  If he wanted to really hang out, to get to know me, he would have cared enough to listen, and at least TRY to understand where I was coming from.  Instead, I got this...""Ohh..yeah...okay then.

"event","...well, not quite really.  I went running today, because it's like, 55 here today, so the rents and I went during the day rather than going tonight.  It was so much easier than the last time, for some reason.  I know the warmer weather makes it easier to breathe, which was great, but I just felt....well, like it was easier.  I could have made it farther, but I stopped when my parents did, so I wasn't completely winded when we had to continue with our walk.  My mom said my legs look thinner, too, which was cool.  I've lost a total of 16 lbs since January 25th, and it's made a difference.  I feel better.  Now, I just need to lose 2 pounds a week for the next 8 months, and I'll be in the proper weight range for a girl my height, and my age, and my frame size.  Yes, I measured my elbow and consulted a proper weight and frame chart, to determine what my healthy range would be.  I'm finally tired of being fat.  It's going to take a lot less time than I thought to lose this weight, too.  My mother put it into perspective the day she told me to figure it out.  I weigh 180 right now.  To be in the range that I should be in, which would be 115-129 for a medium frame, for my height, I would need to lose just about 60 pounds.  She said to think of it this way.  2 lbs a week, multiply that by 4 weeks a month, on average, and you get 8 lbs a month.  Divide 60(or 64, to make it even math), and it will take me eight months of losing at the recommended rate, to lose the weight I want to lose.  The way time has been going lately, that doesn't seem like a very long time to me...And while I know it's sort of like cheating, when I get this reduction, that will probably knock off 10 lbs or so too.  Heh.  

I can do this.  It's getting easier every day.

I got a low interest credit card through my bank to balance transfer my high interest cards to, and will be able to make one payment now, rather than 5 or 6.  Yay me!

Things are looking up.  Now all I have to do is get approved for taking classes at RIT, and find a knitting class I can take, and I'll be excellent.  EX-cellent, I say."

Friday night was my company Christmas party.  I got this nice shirt, with fun red jewelry, and had my hair done for the occasion.  I walked in, and there was already a good gathering going, and immediately found out that they don't take debit card at the bar.  Yikes!  I have to pay someone back, come to think of it.  Second thing I find out is that the DJ had an accident on the way to the party, because of the weather, and he wouldn't be able to make it.  So we spent a near frantic 10 minutes trying to find someone available, on a Friday night, to come to the party.  Surprisingly, we found someone, and he was really good.  The party went well, I won a really nice phone, and had a good time.  I was actually one of the hits of the party, with my dancin skills.  Heh.

Saturday was supposed to be better, and started out sunny until I had a fender bender.  There's a nice dent in my hood because of a truck speeding around a near blind curve, and a gent having his truck parked in the road on said curve when he was shoveling his driveway.  Bleah.  It was either be run down, head on, hit the old guy shoveling to avoid a dent, or take the dent.  I took the dent.  So then I got into this huge ass argument with my parents over what I'm not even sure of anymore, and then went out with a friend of mine from work, to just get out of the house.  

Sunday went well because my parents were back to normal, the weather was snowy, and I got things done in the house.  My mother left for Florida for her job.  Well, former job, now.  I'll get to that.  Dad and I watched the Survivor finale, which we were very happy about, and went to bed too late.

Today work was not so bad, despite being tired, and when I came home, my mother called from Florida to tell us that she'd found out today that in March the company she works for is laying everyone off.  So, she has until March to find another job.  I want to do something.  I NEED to do something, but I feel useless.  I'm frightened for her, because I don't know what's going to happen.  I mean, if anyone can find a job, it's her.  But, sometimes it just gets to wear on a person too much.  I have to try and help her in any way I can.  

Our neighbor called around 8pm ish to tell us that there was a huge 8-point buck in the backyard eating out of our bird feeders.  Sure enough, there he was, gorgeous against the white snow, tipping the feeder towards himself and having his fill.  We left apples outside as well, for the squirrels and rabbits to eat.  He liked those too.  Dad opened the window trying to be stealthy so we could hear him, and get a clearer view, but ended up scaring him away.  I love this house, and this backyard, and this chair, and this desk, and being able to look out into a lovely scene, and just...be happy.  I've got to help my mother, for all those times she helped me...pulled me up, made me feel better, cooked, cleaned, slaved, swore, and felt let down.  It's the only way I could ever come close to paying her back."

We have this bird feeding post, with small birdhouses, and feeders and such.  The squirrels love this area, frequenting it to snag the food we put out for the birds.  My parents bought a squirrel feeder yesterday, in the hopes of deterring the critters from stealing the bird food.  My father built a small shelf for it to sit on, up on the post.  This morning, one industrious little squirrel ran up and down, through the feeder, down to the ground, burying all he could to tide him over this winter.

Deep down, even though I'm generally over my anger at the situation, a small part of me was glad that they felt discomfort at seeing me.  Bet they felt like crap.  That tiny little vindictive voice laughed when I saw the looks on their faces, their unwillingness to look me in the eye.

Also after yesterday, a man walked into a Xerox credit union here in town attempting to rob the place, shooting and killing one man, and injuring another person.  What's really disturbing is that he was wearing a regulation FBI jacket, a U.S. Marshal's badge, and a bullet proof vest.  They still haven't caught him yet.


I took my second to last level test at work today.  I believe I did rather well, and the next thing to do is go on to Senior Specialist school, where I'll get another raise when I pass.  And I will, too.  


OO!!  I got my check from Rochester Clinical Research, and will be paying it to Discover, mainly to pay for my new glasses, and a little bit extra.  I'll be getting a check in the mail for the transport costs of having to transport my father to the medical school, so that will go towards another bill.  I feel like I'm doing well, but am constantly in a slight state of worry that something is going to come crashing down on me eventually.


My horoscope today said...""Bad people exist.  Walk like you know where you're going.  Don't mistrust the man with the arm full of tattoos who doesn't communicate well, however.""  What the hell is that all about?  Way to scare the pants off me before I really wake up."

I cut my hair again, much shorter than before because I just couldn't take it anymore!!  It's been muggy since the beginning of time I think, and my hair was just asking for it.  


Oh!  I just got new glasses today, too.  They're funky chunky Armani frames, and they match my hair really well.  The color, I mean.   I tried to take a picture to show y'all, but my webcam sucks, so I have to wait for better lighting.


That's all for now, but when there's more, I'll write, kay?  Kay."

"event","I've been busy, as per usual.  I worked an extra day this week.  You wouldn't think an extra day would be much, but....it was.  This is how my weekend went.  Thursday I worked all day at Paychex, which means getting up @6am to be ready and to work @ 8am.  Then I worked at the gym right from Paychex until 10pm.  Friday, I worked at Paychex, then went right to the gym to cover for Sarah, and went home, showered, and got to bed by 11pm.  Then I had to be up at 5:45am to be to the gym by 6:30ish, to work until noon.  After I got out of work yesterday, I went to this festival called the Ten Ugly Men.  It's this big kick ass party down in a park here in town where they have bands and everything, volleyball, slip-n-slides, and of course, beer.  All you can eat and all you can drink for $30, which goes to charity.  


I got trashed.  


And I got another tattoo.  Which wasn't bad or anything because I've been meaning to get another, I just wasn't sure when.  So, yesterday was the day.  I got the kanji for ""Wisdom"" on the small of my back.  It didn't hurt much at all, and the artist thought I rocked cause I was so casual about it.  He told me to come see him any time I wanted more work done, which I will, cause he was cool.  Anyhow, I got into a fight with my parents when I got home, but that's no big deal.  Weather is crappy right now, so I'm going to read my new Harry Potter book until my parents come home, then am going to run some errands.  Late."

"event","I'm eating these things I bought in the organic section of our grocery store, and let me tell you.  Yum.  Capital ""Y.""  They're called Genisoy Soy Crisps.  They're a lot like rice cakes, but...made out of soy instead.  I've had the creamy ranch, and the rich cheddar, and both were really good.  I think I've found a new favorite snack.  I'm making a concerted effort to eat better, because I'm never going to lose weight if I don't.  I'm becoming fitter, yes, but the weight is still there.  

Oh, and an investigation into a breast reduction is in the works.  I have to make an appointment with my doctor to see if she thinks it's something I should look into.  At this point it might be the only thing that will work to get rid of the back pain that's bothered me for much of my young adult life.  I work out nearly every day, and lift weights, and relatively watch what I eat, and yet my back still aches all day long.  Bah.  I'll keep the investigation updated.  I have to work at 6:30am at the gym tomorrow, so I'm going to play a quick game online, then head to bed.  Night."

"event","We're supposed to get some nice thunderstorms tonight...or at least I thought we were.  It's been windier than Chicago here today, and it was sort of nice to be able to look out the window at work today and see things changing.  The clouds were always different, there WERE clouds, and the trees were always moving.  It was kind of nice, seeing as it was the day from hell at work.  

Coming back to work after a few days off when you work in payroll is like..taking a year long hiatus from the computer world.  Everything piled up, everything was changed, and I was frustrated, considering half the shit that should have been done while I was gone, wasn't.  Not to mention today was the day that everyone decided to send their problems to me, causing an even bigger pile of shit to appear in my In box.  Dammit.  

On the upside, I went to the gym tonight, and had another re-evaluation to see how things are going.  I lost another inch around my waist, lost 6.8 lbs of fat, and gained 5.9 lbs of muscle.  People keep telling me they're seeing a difference.  I'm still not, not really anyway, since I see myself every day.  I'm pretty pleased with how the clothes are fitting, however.  

I might go test drive a Mitsubishi Outlander on Friday.  I have only a half day of work, so I might go see how they drive.  A dealership here has a really good deal on them, so who knows?  I might have a new mid-sized SUV by Friday.....though I highly doubt it.  Anyway, gonna run, since I'm beat.  Nighties."

Not much to update.  =)  I got up at 5:30am, worked from 6:30am until noon, came home, ate lunch, and painted the trim around my windows and door.  All that remains is hanging my bamboo shade, getting a curtain for the closet door, putting down a final piece of molding, then making some curtains for the windows.  I'm excited.  Mom and I had dinner, sat outside admiring the yard, then vegged in front of the tv, watching Trading Spaces.  Love that show.  Anyway, been up since early this morning, so I'm beat.  Nighties."

"event","I forgot to update about jury duty.  I had to go in for jury duty on Wednesday, and it wasn't all that horrible.  I sat and talked with a nice girl named Sarah, since we hadn't been selected to sit on a jury, but had to wait until 12:45pm to be dismissed completely.  That part sorta sucked, but I got to read, and look out the window at the pretty intersection in a part of the city that I never go.  There was a gorgeous old cathedral, the oldest building in Rochester right on the other corner, and the building that I was looking at directly had all these American flags flying.  The sky was blue, the sun was shining, and it wasn't altogether that bad.


Yesterday was my birthday, and despite having had to work at the gym, it was a good birthday.  My parents and sister came up to see me at work, unexpectedly, and brought me little presents.  I thought it was so sweet.  Melanie asked me to go to yoga class with her this morning, and Mom's taking me out for dinner tonight.  Melanie is a girl I work with, who happens to know a guy my parents and I used to work with when I was in high school.  We sort of hit it off, and I thought it was really nice that she asked if I wanted to do a class with her.  Larry, a friend of mine from Paychex also said something about taking me out this weekend for a little birthday celebration, but who knows how that's gonna go.  Oh!!  Christy called me from Cali, and sang Happy Birthday to me on my voicemail.  I miss that girl so much.  I called her back for a few minutes before my sleepy sister came in to inform me that she was indeed in bed.  Oh well.  I told Christy I'd try and call her back tonight or something.  Yay!  And, I have the day off today, my Road Runner is working (finally), and it's gorgeous out.  I think after yoga I'm going to clean the house, and maybe mow the lawn.  Late."

Aside from dealing with everything that went along, and still goes along with my father dying, things are going well.  I'm still working out at the gym, and working two jobs, and seeing a definite difference in my bills.  Tomorrow is my birthday, and I have off from Paychex, but not the gym, so I have to work for a few hours on my birthday.  No big deal.  I have Friday off from work as well, and some coworkers want to take me out for a bit of a celebration.  We'll see how that goes.  


My parents and I have spent nearly two weeks redesigning my room.  We put in a hardwood parquet floor, painted the walls and ceiling, and repainted my furniture to match.  It makes me happy just to sit in here now.  I finally got everything moved back in, and got my computer set back up today.  I'm still waiting on the Road Runner hook up, however, since the router still isn't working for some reason.  I'm going to close for now, and watch some tv before bed.  Night."

"event","Things are hard for me right now.  I've had a rather rough couple of days.  I'm finding my fuse rather short with people this week.  I went back to work today for a few hours at the gym, and every time someone said something stupid, I wanted to tell them to shut up.  That wouldn't have done me much good, but it would have made me feel a hell of a lot better.  


I don't know why I should be so damned cheerful all the time. And I don't see the point in holding back what I think, either.  I understand the concept of tact, but what point is there?  Life is too short to hide things, so why hide contempt either?  Why hide it when someone says something that's flat out wrong, and I know the correct answer?  Why bother trying to tip toe around other peoples' feelings, when no one bothers to tip toe around mine?  Why bother helping people when all they do is turn around and look out for themselves when it comes time to help me?  These are all hypothetical questions, and I'm not referring to anyone in particular, but these are things I've wondered for a long time.  Why not just tell people what I think when I think it?  I wonder how long I'd last if I started doing that.

I spent all day yesterday, and most of today taking care of his affairs.

Despite going to bed at a consistent time, working out, and all that jazz, I've been exhausted.  I mean, like, super fatigued.  So, I went to the doctor, and they want me to have blood drawn to see if there's something wrong with my thyroid.  Which, they think there is.  Ick.  But, if that's what it is, I guess there's a little pill I take every day, and Dani is all better again.  I haven't updated in a while because I'm hardly ever online anymore.  I'm trying to get the rest of the wallpaper down in my room, work out consistently, do well at work, eat better, and have a social life.  Which isn't easy, considering I'm also saving for a new car, and trying to get things ready to eventually move out.  Which, I'm hoping will be by my 25th birthday.

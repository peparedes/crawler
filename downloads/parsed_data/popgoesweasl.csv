"event","One day will be THE day.  THE day that I realize I'm too old to live.  Hopefully that day is a long way away.  Hopefully, I'll remember life is a journey and to enjoy the trip.  Each day I look at life passing me by and I wonder, do all those people out there enjoy their journey?  Do the radicals enjoy blowing people up?  Is their part in the fabric of life worthwhile?  Do the little kids ever think they'll be old one day? Do all the policy makers who put conditions on life, do they enjoy their end result?  Will they be on their death beds saying, ""Wow, I really made those peoples' lives better.""  What about all those people staying connected on their cell phones while they drive, are they enjoying their journey?  Will they enjoy their journey more if they run someone off the road while they are talking on their phone?  Will they regret texting while driving?  All those people in a hurry to get to work, are they having fun?  Do they enjoy their jobs?
I watched someone begin their journey out of the corporeal world and into the spiritual.  It was quick and long at the same time.  It was a long time coming, but still a surprise when it happened.  When it was all over, I clearly remember thinking, I don't want to go out that way.  I don't want to lie in the bed with tubes coming out of my nose, family around feeling helpless, and feeling every bit of my physical body die.  
I've heard of conscious dying.  That one of our goals on earth, when we leave, is to consciously die.  One of the lessons we are to accomplish is the spiritual awakening of knowing what is going on when we die.  I don't think I'm that enlightened, because the thought of living through the dying is frightening.  I'm not sure I want to find out how much physical pain I can endure - it seems like dying would be painful.
So, when THE day arrives, will I know it?  Will I be in a hospital bed with tubes coming out of my nose?  Will I have enjoyed every minute leading up to that moment?  Makes the thought of living fast, loving hard, and dying young very appealing.  I don't know if I'm brave enough to get old.

"event","I'm running through a hardwood forest, it's daylight. I know this because I can see sunlight filtering through the treetops. I'm in a hurry -feeling of urgency and dread control my flight. I'm running to a stronghold where I'm wanted as a fugitive. I must go to the stronghold to see if the rumor is true-the rumor that THEY are collecting all the young ( <100) dragons.

I have a friend following behind me, a roundish girl with blonde hair cut in a swinging bob. She's a cheery sort, smart, likes to dress in pinks and lilacs. Her name is Lilian.

I have another friend, James, who works as a guard at the stronghold. He wears glasses, has a stocky build,and milk chocolate skin. James plays the role of a double-agent. His uncle is high-up in the guard ranks and it is a family duty to work in the fortress. James is a rebel sympathizer and in love with my pink clothed friend.

A village surrounds the fortress. It is a marketplace that acts as the front door to the stronghold. Recon can be done from the market, but it's a double-edged sword. Lilian and I survey the stronghold, but see nothing from the front. James finds us skulking around the market and tells us we need to recon from the backside. We follow him to a small cluster of bushes next to the bridge. Here the security is lax. The enemy is secure in their superiority, their crushing force. James leaves us by the bushes to spy and returns to his duties. We stay there all day and night watching carts roll through with enormous crates. The carts are followed by drummers to drown out the dragons' bellows.
I'm enraged, upset to tears. I decide to follow one of the carts. I roll underneath and hitch a ride by holding on to the planks of the cart.
I'm enter into a rough stone built room. It is a huge cavern with tunnels branching off from all sides like a giant spider. The cart I'm holding onto goes down one of these many tunnels. The way is lit by torches recessed into cutout shelves of the tunnel wall. The tunnel opens up into a large, long rectangular shape room with stalls on either side of the cavern. Housed in these stalls are dragons. The stables are so narrow the dragons cannot spread their wings, and so short they cannot fully extend their necks. I see a large bale of hay and roll of the cart to conceal myself in it. I watch as armored men load the dragon into a hay-lined stall. It contains a barrel of water and a food trough. The dragon's neck has a circlet of metal attached to a long rod which the men use to control the head. The wings are bound at the shoulders with a fishing net as are the hands and feet. The men are surprisingly gentle as they release the dragon into the stall, cut the bindings, and detach the pole from the metal ring. The men fill the water bucket by pumping the water through a metal pipe and then leave.

Later:
James comes to me, says he needs to show me something special. I follow him, he tells me not to worry about being noticed because no one comes down this particular hall. We pass cell after cell of dragon, most are asleep. A few dragons noticed us and their eyes light up. Some speak to me as I pass. They are all beautiful. I feel as though a big event is about to happen. I can feel the energy pricking my skin. We come to an area of shower stalls, huge dragon-size stalls. A curtain is drawn across one and it is this one James goes to. He pulls aside the curtain and then leaves out of a side tunnel.

I look at the dragon and she returns my gaze. She drops her head so we are eye-to-eye. Her snout is long and tapered. Her coloring has a royal blue base with purples swirling and melting together. I'm enchanted, filled with wonder. She dips her head to the side so I can see the curve of her neck where the metal circlet is. She is attached to the wall by a pole running from the circlet to a ring on the shower stall. I unfasten the pole from her circlet releasing her head. Her head comes up in a rush, stretching and twisting the kinks out of a long-time cramp. She comes back eye level, puts her mouth onto my lips and nose, and holds me fast. I'm not hurt, but I feel a tingling, an energy rush. It feels like light bursting out of me, my whole body feels on fire. I can see nothing but blinding light. I hear nothing but an ocean's roar and smell only the breath of dragon, which smells oddly enough like honey. As soon as the rush of energy began, it was over. I felt sleepy, but supremely aware of everything. I could hear the mice in the hay, smell the market a mile to the front of the fortress, see not just the blues and purples on the dragon's skin, but the entire rainbow as dragons know it. I was truly alive.

I wasted no time in untying the dragon from her stall. We both left by the side door James had taken earlier. We were in too much of a hurry to speak, we quietly ran into the forest. The dragon took some time to wake up long unused muscles and I began putting to use the newly given energy. After a while, I began to tire. The dragon allowed me onto her back. I sat just below the wings and lay my head between her shoulder blades, wrapping my arms underneath the wing joint. We flew many miles and set down in a large ring of stones with concentric rings going ever larger. Here we rested for the night.
  We talk, we learn of each other, we speak of the capture of so many young dragons and why. We talk of THEM and THEIR plans, why I'm a fugitive. We speak of James and Lilian. We speak of a plan.


Much later sequence:
A burned out village, a chariot chasing us, we are blackened with soot. We are dirty from running and injured. My dragon is carrying me, but is losing altitude. A maniacal man dressed in black, bald, wide-mouthed, gleaming teeth, is laughing at us. He is twirling a lasso while riding his horse under us. He catches my dragon around the neck and brings her out of the air. I tumble from her back. He uses the lasso from the dragons neck to hog-tie her as she lands. I land on a roof beam from the burnt out inn and am stunned. My dragon is tied to a pole attached to the chariot pulled by four stallions. The man laughs and shouts as he drives of, ""I do not have to capture you, you will come to find your dragon."" He rides away as I am sliding and slipping down the inn roof. When I reach the ground, scrambling up, I am running after the chariot. I am sick and hurt. I am left to follow the trail the chariot leaves. I can hear the shrill keening of my dragon. I stumble and fall on the rocky path, staring at the dust of the driving chariot.


The Sentinels are coming; the big, red and black dragons who guard the clans. I feel their presence in my mind. They have been watching, they understand. They received our hard won message, they will help, it is no longer a human matter that will clear up. They will carry out the plan.

"event","It's our second day touring New York. We arrived the same way we did the day before, the New Jersey Transit (Metro). Our goals this day were to see Central Park, Strawberry Field, Times Square, Coney Island, and Wall Street. We began with Times Square taking a leisurely walk for maximum sight-seeing. It's so cool to see all these tall building with moving bill boards. Hailing from central FL, we don't see to many sky scrapers. We wandered into Times Square, saw the building where the ball is dropped on New Year's, and found a 3-story Toys R Us. Well, we had to visit that! What a huge store. Well equipped with staff to help and give demonstrations of certain toys. They had a great Lego department complete with an Empire State building (including King Kong), a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Chrysler Building, and the Statue of Liberty all done up in Legos. They even had a mini ferris wheel for the tykes. Very cool place. From there we went on to Central Park.

Our first view of Central Park was the day before from the Observatory Deck on the Empire State building. It looked like a huge patch of green walled in by concrete and glass. When you're on the ground and in the park, it feels like a sanctuary. Even with kids playing, bicyclists, roller bladers, dog walkers, and street dancers - it still feels like this private, quiet place of refuge. We stopped in the park for hot dogs and ice cream. Contrary to my belief that the park was just grass and trees, there are enormous granite rocks laid out. It makes for a nice picnic area. We sat atop these rocks surveying the park and being harassed by bold squirrels. 
We continued on through the park on our way to Strawberry Field. My daughter is a huge fan of the Beatles, so we had to make a pilgrimage to Lennon's Memorial. It is a quiet place also. We arrived at the memorial on one of three sidewalks that leads into it. There where the three sidewalks meet is a round metal disk set into the concrete with a pattern of stone bricks encircling it. On the disk are flowers, pictures, a guitar, and coins left by Lennon's fans in farewell. This shrine to Lennon left me with a very quiet and sad feeling. We moved on to Coney Island.
The ride to Coney Island, by subway, took about an hour. Approaching the island you can see gaudy billboards, a small amusement park, and the ocean. Our first stop was to Nathan's Famous Hotdogs. We all got hotdogs, cheese fries, and lemonades. The fries were real potatos with real potato taste, they even had the skins on! The hotdogs were the best. Now I can say I had a hotdog from Coney Island, which is the reason we went. After the food, we walked the boardwalk. What a dilapidated, sorry looking sight. The planks were worn and badly patched, the atmosphere was like a bad carnival film, and the place was dirty. Not much to see. We did stop by the coaster so my daughter could have a ride. It's an old rickety, wooden coaster that was probably the greatest thing back in the day. All the kids seemed to love it.

Our last stop was to the Wall Street area where the Towers were. We took the subway back to lower Manhattan. Of all our experiences on the subway, this last trip was probably the most realistic of NY life. We were on during the rush hour home. I have never seen so many people crowded on a mode of transportation! As fast as the doors open and shut on the subway, we were worried we wouldn't be able to get out on time with the crush of people. Of course we made it, but there was pushing and shoving involved. So we land at Wall Street moving with the onrushing flow of people to where the Towers stood. Today, it looks like any construction site. People were getting off work, heavy machinery left in piles of sand, and it was quiet. Turning around I could see a couple of buildings that still wear the mark of the terrible heat from the blast. It really is something to stand in a place where so many people lost their lives. Looking around me, I tried to imagine the push of so many people fleeing for their lives that day. I tried to see how emergency vehicles would've managed to edge their way into such a crowded and narrow place. I'm amazed more people didn't die that day. It sure does give testament to the strength of humankind.
Wall Street was our last stop in NY. We made our way back to Penn Station to catch the Metro back to NJ. We made the train fine, but another train had broken down on the tracks. We waited half an hour for it to be removed, and then a switch failed. It took us 2 1/2 hours to get back to NJ that night. Everyday life in the city.

I have to say, coming from the South we have a preconceived notion of NY and the people who live and work there. We hear rumors of how crime ridden the place is, how rude the people are, how filthy it is, and expensive. I have a new understanding of city life now that I've visited as an adult with open eyeballs. Yes, the city does have crime, but no more than our major cities in the South. Yes, the city air is dirty when you compare it to the clean air of pasture land; however the city itself was clean. There wasn't a lot of trash and grossness in the streets, or around the base of the buildings. I left with a very professional feeling about NY, it's all business. And because it's all business it gets a reputation for being rude. I don't think NY is a rude place and here's why. The amount of people in the city is unbelievable, and with all those people trying to make appointments on time, getting to work and doing what they've got to do there's bound to be some brusqueness. It's a necessary thing. If you stop to apologize for bumping into people, or to say ""Hey how's it going?"" you'd NEVER get anywhere. There are just too many people. Another thing is that it is very fast paced. Even getting on and off the subway. You have 10 seconds to get your butt on the train - it waits for nobody. Everybody has deadlines to meet and for the city to work efficiently it is a MUST that it moves so fast. The entire time I was in NY, I was only bumped once in all that foot traffic. People make it a point to be considerate by staying out of each other's way. 
Some riders on the subway overheard me speaking with a member of our group on how to get somewhere. The riders politely asked if we needed assistance on figuring out the correct train to take and gave us correct directions. This happened more than once. So, I can't say that NY people as a whole, are rude and unconcerned. 
I think the South, especially in the country, isn't as populated per square whatever as the North. As a consequence, it would be real awkward if you and one other person were traveling in the same direction and didn't say hello, or make eye-contact. Just a different way of life.
On that note, people's need to constantly be in connection is a side effect of city life. Out here in the country, I'm pretty close to my family. It doesn't take long to see them, we don't have long work hours, and the pace is slower. But up in the city, it takes FOREVER to get somewhere so that travel time adds big time to the work hours. I figure a person up there has to get up around 5, get to the park and ride parking lot by 6/6:30 to catch a train into the city, then get on the subway to get to work by 8. Take that same route to go home and, I figure, they don't get home until 8/9 pm. When do they get to be with their family? Their family time is on the cell phone while riding the train home. It's sad when you really think about it. I think the boost in technology is made for city life. For the longest time I couldn't understand the fascination with all the techno gadgets, but now I do. It's a way of keeping in contact with family you live with but hardly see. It's a way of keeping to yourself when the crowded conditions of a city presses its nose into your business.

It was very different visiting NY. People ask me if I had a good time, and I guess I did; but the overwhelming feeling of having learned something, of gaining new perspective is what I really came back with.

"event","New York City was on the schedule for days 4 and 5. We drove to NJ to pick up our other half and to catch the Metro. Going this way into the city takes about an hour on a good day. A good day is when nothing happens to any of the trains, the tracks, or the switches. Our goal for the first day was to see the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Little Italy, and China Town. We were a little ambitious. 
The Metro landed us at Penn Station in Manhattan. From there we walked and gawked our way to the Empire State Building. There was a line outside just to get in and wait on another line. Then you go through security where some people have to practically undress. My husband and I had to take our belts off and empty our pockets completely. A word of advice, don't wear steel toed boots, it makes the security guys nervous. It takes about an hour of waiting in various lines before you can get your ticket. When you get to the ticket booth you have a choice of buying a ticket for the Observatory or the Observatory Plus. The Plus ticket includes an audioview which is a radio that you rent to explain what you're seeing while at the top. You can also spend some extra money to go up to the 102nd floor (regular ticket is for the 87th floor), and xtra $ for the Express Pass to avoid waiting in line. To get to the top, you go in a slightly elderly elevator with 19 other people. If you're not claustrophobic, you will be after this. The 87th floor Observatory is quite an amazing view. From there, the Statue of Liberty is the size of your thumb. You certainly can see a very long way. You can take as long as you want looking around and taking pictures. Then you begin the long wait in line to go back down. You go down the same way you got up -packed in the elderly elevator with 19 other people.
After all the long lines, our group was hungry. We stopped at a hot dog cart and got some food. I've always heard that NY was expensive, but the hot dog cart was a good deal. We got a skewer of steak, 3 hot dogs, and three cokes for $10. I was happy.
With satisfied bellies, we made our way to the subway station. There are no tokens to get on the subway like you see in the movies. You have to go to this machine and get a metro card. FYI- A metro card is only good for 4 swipes in one station at a time. We found all this out the hard way. If you have a group of more than four, buy two metro cards and put at least $20 on each. Every time you go through the turnstile it takes $2 off your card. Anyway, we took the subway down to where you catch the ferry for Liberty Island. If you have a large group, select two people to go get tickets for the ferry and have the rest wait in the security line. The line is long enough that you'll have your tickets well before you get into the security booth. In the security booth they check your bags, everything must come out of your pockets, belts come off, shoes sometimes come off (as in our case), and you're not allowed to use your cell phone while in the booth. After you redress, you're on your way to the ferry. The ferry ride is a fairly calm ride to Liberty Island. They swing the boat around so you can get plenty of good shots of Liberty herself. You're only allowed to go onto the island. Unless you call the parks service well in advanced to get special permission and tickets, you aren't allowed inside Liberty or the the Liberty Museum at the base of the statue. The plaque that used to sit on the base of Liberty, the one that says: send me all your tired, poor, and hungry; that is now in the museum, so I didn't get to see it. The view from Liberty Island is fantastic. The NY skyline is still a sight to see, even if it is still wounded. We stayed awhile and took pictures then took the ferry back to Manhattan. If we had gotten there earlier, we could've taken the ferry to Ellis Island too, but nobody wanted to go.
Since we were so close, we decided to walk down to Little Italy and eat dinner. It was the one thing I insisted on doing before leaving NY. We got a nice view of the city on our walk, even seeing a tiny part of China Town on the way. By the way, NY's China Town is much cleaner than Philly's. We got to little Italy and it was great! All these restaurants with great smelling food and people speaking in Italian was wonderful. I felt like I was a kid again. Little Italy was clean, bright colored, and brisk. Everything in NY moves fast. I finally found a place that was in our price range and could get a table ready in 5 minutes. We ate great food, had great service, and were able to relax and people watch. 
It was getting very late to be in an unfamiliar city, so we made our way to Penn Station. We took the Metro back to our car in NJ to get ready for another day in NY.

"event","Day 3 of our trip to the Northeast was to Hershey, Pennsylvania. I got very lucky in that a friend, who lives in Ohio, agreed to drive out and meet us. Being that the drive from OH was a 6 hour drive, we agreed to meet at noon. The drive from Delaware, through NJ to pick up other family members, and then through PA was a beautiful drive. We drove through curvy hillsides, pasture land, Amish country, and family farms with gorgeous trees lining the road. It took only two hours to get there. When you arrive at the Hershey attractions, it is run like any other amusement park. You have to pay to park and, of course, you can see the roller coaster rides from the main road coming in. It's all very exciting.
We met at the Hershey museum but came to the conclusion everything we wanted to do was at Chocolate World. On our way to Chocolate World, my daughter trips down the stairs skinning her knee and jamming her finger. Our first stop then was to the first aid room. The staff was very nice and patched my daughter up thoroughly, including a small bag of Hershey Kissables to make things better. 
From there we took the Chocolate tour. On this tour you sit in a moving car and are taken through the chocolate making process by films and displays complete with singing cows. You learn a little about the cocoa beans, the trees they come from, what part of the bean is made into chocolate and how it's all done. Quite interesting. 
Next we did the chocolate tasting experience which is like a wine tasting class, but for chocolate. The guide takes a small group of 16 people back to the tasting room. There he taught us to look, listen, and savor the chocolate starting with nibs (pieces of the cocoa bean). We tasted everything from hot cocoa, to milk chocolate, to some fancy European brand of dark chocolate. It is such a rich chocolate experience -I haven't had a piece of chocolate candy for 2 weeks!
Leaving the tasting room with nauseous stomachs, we concluded our Hershey experience with a trolley tour. There are two kinds of trolley tours. One is purely informational, the other is informative with a singing duo. We had to do the singing duo tour because the other was sold out, and now I know why. We get on the trolley which takes you around the town of Hershey. You see the mansion that Mr. Hershey built, the school house that Mr. Hershey built for orphan boys, Hershey factory (which you're not allowed to tour), the lights in the shape of Hershey kisses, Hershey Hotel, and the Hershey amusement park. As you're seeing all this, your two tour guides are putting on a very cheesy (not chocolaty) show demonstrating the history of Hershey and singing very loudly. I left off the trolley with a beautiful migraine. It was very informative and I have a new appreciation for the Hershey family, but I could've done without the singing. By the time the trolley tour was over it was about 4 o'clock and our group was hungry. We left Hershey to go get a decent, non-chocolate meal at a local restaurant. Since we began our stay at Hershey so late in the day, we decided spending $50/person to get into the amusement park really wasn't worth it (even the staff at Chocolate World suggested this). All in all, we had a good time. If we wanted to do everything Hershey had to offer we would've had to stay over. It is a two day experience.

"event","Vacation, a time to relax from your up-tight life and enjoy the wonders the world has to offer. Wonders that can sometimes resemble an episode of Ripley's Believe It Or Not, for example, how many people can fit into a high-speed elevator going down 80 floors. I think the answer was 20, or it sure felt like it, more about that in a later entry. 
I got a chance to go tour a few of the big cities of America with my family. Our first tour was of Philadelphia. My husband and I dutifully looked at our map for directions to parking garages in the area, picked one out, and aimed the car in its general direction. Sounds a lot easier than it was. We were doing well until we ran up on a road with construction and had to detour. Then our detour led us down a one-way street going in the opposite direction of our destination. After 30 minutes of cursing, being honked at, nearly running over 3 pedestrians, going on a pier we had no intentions of getting on, and back-tracking many city blocks we finally found a place to park. For all our trouble, $10 for the day didn't seem so bad. That was our introduction to Philly. 
Our first stop was the Liberty Bell. It's in a covered area with security guards and bag checkers.  Apparently, government officials think terrorists want to blow up a 200  year old bell. Anyway we got to get our picture taken next to the bell. There was a bit of a walk through to get there with the history of the bell on displays, but there wasn't a person guiding you through. If you're not big on the history of the bell it can be a blaise stop. Next, we went to the visitor center to get tickets for a tour. The tickets are free, but you can't get in some places without one. The security people limit the number of visitors for certain areas. We wanted to see the room where the Declaration of Independence was signed, so we had to go get tickets. We had a very informative guide who explained any and everything about the process, the dates involved, and the people who made history happen. Some of the guards in the display areas were very tightly wound. If you left the door open too long, they yelled at you for exposing precious documents to too much light. If you asked about touching any of the artifacts, you'll get an indepth explanation of why you must not touch it with your bare hands (because of the acids on them), and how you have to wear special gloves to touch anything. These may be the only facts my daughter remembers from the whole trip due to the excitability of the guards. 
After the tour, we wandered around a little bit and found the US Mint. We thought that sounded like a neat place to see until we reached the doors with a placard declaring that no photo equipment of any kind was allowed (including cell phones), no book bags, no large purses, and of course no weapons. Well we were all equipped with something that wasn't allowed in the mint and no easy place to store it. We saved the mint for day 2. We continued on towards China Town to see the shops. We got about 3 blocks into it before we could no longer stand the stench of garbage, fish, car fumes, and other grossness. We turned back around and went to The Gallery which is an enclosed mall. It was huge. Three stories high with all kinds of stores. We stopped there for lunch at the food court. We were all so hot and tired, and my daughter looked as though she was going to pass out from heat exhaustion, we called it a day. Went back to the hotel and swam in the pool.
We stayed at a hotel in Delaware it being central to our plans for the first week. For dinner that first night, we went north on 202 and ate at a British Pub called Stoney's. It was a nice little place, friendly atmosphere, and good fish and chips. 
Day 2 in Philly didn't start too much better than the first. Finding parking in an unfamiliar town with construction and too many wrong-way, one-way streets is a recipe for aggravation at best. We were wise to the rules of the Mint, so we left all our stuff in the car and made it our first stop. It is a self-guided tour with all the information you'd want to know posted on the walls and on push button video. You can see part of the coin making process which gives you an idea of the immensity of US currency production. It was very informative. And of course, the self-guided tour ended in the souvenir shop. By the way, all those security measures are by the book depending on WHO is at the metal detector when you come in. Plenty of people got in with stuff that was marked a no-no by the front door placard. 
After the Mint, we found Ben Franklin's Printing House. It was a nice quiet place where a guide gives you a demonstration of how the printing presses worked back in the day. I really liked looking at all the old equipment. They even had old book bind machinery with a huge corkscrew to push the papers together. Very nice display with friendly people willing to explain the printing process of old. After that we went to the building the Philly visitor center was located in. I'm not sure if it was City Hall or what, but the building itself was fantastic. It has a statue in gold paint on the very top of the building. You could see it from a long ways away. There were carvings all over the building of people and animals. It had wonderful stonework. It was worth the walk just to look at the art of the building. From there we were hungry so we went to this huge indoor market. You could get anything here. It was on Arch St, just before it dead ends at the above mentioned building. In the market you could get books, beer, fresh butchered meat, vegetables, food to go, pastries, candies, just bunches of stuff. We couldn't decide where to eat. We ended up going across the street to a British Tavern called Independence run by Hard Rock. They had pretty good food, very quiet atmoshpere, waiters who wanted to be actors, and roomy booths. I liked it. 
After eating I wanted to see Edgar Allan Poe's house. We walked all the way across downtown (with a very tired, and soggy spirited child) to find out that Poe's house is only open from Wednesday to Sunday. WTF? I didn't remember that being in the tour guide book, but in fairness to AAA it did say to call ahead for hours. If ever you decide to visit, drive. The neighborhood doesn't give off the warmest vibes. On the way back into town we stopped at a park so people could get ice cream and rest. After resting we walked back to the car. We had one more stop to make. We got out our handy maps again, this time looking for Pat's Steaks. We found it in a not so nice part of town, different from Poe's place. The parking is crazy, the drivers are insane, and the locals all know you're not one of them. This, however, didn't deter us. Pat's is the place where the Philly Cheesesteak was born, so we had to give it a try. They have special instructions on how to order your food, very efficient. We ordered a Philly Cheesesteak and some drinks, took pictures of everything in the area, and then made our way quickly out of Philly for the last time. The next day we were off to Hershey.

i move slowly
to attempt quickness would cause pain

i'm in a state of chaos- i am everything and nothing
i am tired, but cannot sleep
close my eyes but get no rest
run nowhere and sit everywhere

the lead is poisoning me
seeping through my being, leaking out my pores
a graying vapor surrounding me

my mind whirls in infinite thought yet i feel sluggish and stupid
it's like a mirrored room, too many sharp images become vague shapes
i hear laughter on the wind only to find the breeze stilled
the radios play on and on in my head

solid liquid rolling in my gut
bullets jockeying for position
which one(s) will get the upper hand?

i'm not in a good place 
this everlasting maze of chaos
to which i cannot find the door out of
i wonder if the door is made of lead?"

Driving out of my neighborhood, I stopped at the stop sign on the road leading out onto the highway. I sat there in my car for a few seconds, thinking before I checked traffic. The flowers around the stop sign caught my attention. Pretty little things they were, little spots of whites, yellows, and violet. Clinging to one of the violet colored flowers was a butterfly - black and yellow striped, almost as small as the flower he was supping from. I watched for a moment and found his scene to be so poetic, so full of the trials of life. Here beside a quiet little street, that intersected a very busy truck route, was this delicate little life grasping on to the nectar of a vibrantly beautiful flower. His fine line legs were clearly defined, black sticks dug into the flower petals. The wind was blowing rather hard, as we had a front coming in with rain. The wind blew the flower and the butterfly back, they streamed together like the mane of a running horse. I was impressed with the strength of such a fine, fragile creature in the face of the wind.
The butterfly doesn't contemplate its station and the intricacies of life. It goes on doing what's necessary for the moment, not worried too much about long-term consequences. I guess survival is a little different when you only have 3 weeks to live a lifetime. What can I learn from this butterfly and his snap-shot of life that I was so fortunate to witness?

"event","OMG, I suck! Like every other journal I've started, this one has fallen by the wayside.
I cannot keep a consistent diary, journal, update page, newsletter, or any other written medium up-to-date. Yep.

Whether I write about it or not, life still seems to go on. School is quickly coming to an end for the 2006-2007 year. As of today, we have 29 days. That will free up some time. Not that it will matter for journal writing (har).

Let me begin with some comments about the VA TECH shooting spree. Since it is the hot topic of the week, I'd rather not dwell on it too much. It is an incredible tragedy; a terrible waste of youth and potential. Those youngsters had an abundance of life to share with everyone and some crazy took it all away. If you're gonna go crazy, do us all a favor and get help. If help is not enough to save you, then save the rest of us by taking yourself out and leaving the rest of us alone. People are in an outrage, screaming ""how can this happen,"" ""why did this happen,"" and ""could somebody have stopped it?"" People go crazy all the time. If we are allowed to properly defend ourselves, any potential threat may stay just that, potential. If the colleges and other school campuses aren't going to allow the faculty, staff, and student population to carry weapons, then those who are in power need to be responsible for everyone's welfare. If they aren't up to the challenge, then give me and everyone else, the right to defend ourselves with the appropriate tools. I bet if one of those professors were allowed to carry a weapon, a lot less innocent people would've died. This is our wake- up call. Imagine this same scenario with multiple shooters, not a nice thought is it?

Warm weather and butterflies are here. The hawks and woodpeckers have returned. I can smell the bobcat on the wind. My flowers are in bloom. The plum and peach trees have tiny fruits. Spring is here in full force, and I'm loving every minute of it. Spring is passionate this year. It came in teasing, kinda cool, then warm. Now its wind whips us around and leaves us dizzy. I welcome Spring with new plantings and meditative healings. I am blooming with my flowers under the mischievious gaze of Spring. 

Life has been life these past few months. Some ups, quite a few downs and the world keeps spinning. The drama of ""the baby"" is still center stage at my mom's. Mom is still caring for her and it seems likely that she'll have that role awhile. The baby is doing great. She looks like a real baby, not some emaciated doll. She responds to her name. She mimics sounds and facial expressions. She's able to eat sort of solid food, like rice cereal. So far, no ill effects of biological mom's drug abuse are evident, but it's still very early. This child has given my mom a second wind in life. Mom has so much more energy and is happier. I think this baby gives mom purpose, and is the blessing in disguise that a wise old owl once told me about. 

That's it for now, ta ta 'til next time.............

"event","It's that time of year when all who have school age children have to deal with the big yearly assessment. For us, it is the infamous FCAT. Actually, the FCAT wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't the 'be all, end all'. A kid can make straight A's all year but flunk the FCAT, and that one test will ensure they are retained. It's not right. Some children freak out during testing. My household didn't sleep all weekend because our FCAT taker was so worried. If the FCAT was just a loose assessment of how much the child has learned during the year, if it was one part of the whole, I wouldn't mind so much. If the FCAT tested the children on their ability level and not the state expected ability level (which are two totally different things), it wouldn't be so bad. There are some children, no matter how hard they try, they will never meet the government standards. For whatever reason:  learning disabilities, family situations, frequent moving; some kids never reach the state's goal. It makes our education system worse and jips our children out of a fun learning environment.  blah.

Soccer season is coming to a close which means I won't be too drag-ass tired to log in. This soccer season sucked. The kids were immature, the coach had no control, and too many of the parents were uninvolved. It was a frustrating season. On the positive side, my soccer player discovered what a wonder she is in the goalie box. She was able to punt the ball past half field. She didn't do too badly on offense either, although no goals scored thus far. One more game to go.

For any who has been wondering right along with me on the baby saga, it's not his. The test came back and dropped a bomb on my brother. My mom still has the baby and is caring for her as an adoptive parent. Mom still wants to raise her, we'll see if the courts will allow it. Now comes the mind-boggling amount of court dates, paperwork, and social worker visits that a situation like this warrants. Yippee.

On the bizarre and incredibly remote chance there is of the government ""listening"" in for key words like bomb linked with any of our government officials' names, I have a message for you. Tell Big Dick Cheney to stay home. Hearing that a suicide bomber went after him (coincidence or not) in Afghanistan doesn't make me happy. I have family bravely serving over there and would prefer they didn't get caught in any attack due to the fact that Cheney can't just stay home. It's a shame any of our service members were hurt in that attack. I think it's terrible when our military people get hit because some bomb-crazy ass-wipe is going after our political elite. Stay the hell home.

On that note.............everyone have a great evening!

"event","Wow! It's been a little while since I've posted. The craziness of life doesn't end with the holidays and consequently, I've been running like a loon.
My family's a little spread out now. My step-son is in Kabul. His wife is in Iraq. They are both armed and in dangerous zones which makes part of my life very sad. I send safe and happy thoughts to them daily, and boxes of pop-tarts bi-weekly. Not much else you can do.
The brother's baby situation is in suspense. We are all holding our breath for the outcome of the paternity test and the court dates that follow. In the meantime, mom has really taken to being a ""new mom"" again. With some extra $ support and positve feeling she's doing well. My brother, on the other hand, is angry at the world because he only gets to see the baby one hour a week. Tough times for him makes tough times for us all.
I've been back to work. The kids keep me sane. They may grow up a little, but they don't change much. They are a much needed constant in my life. I like helping them to see more than just reading and math. They help to give me another purpose other than worrying about my family.
My new year resolution is the continuation of bettering myself. I'm still working on centering and balancing my life. My eyes are open to advice and guidance. I'm dreaming with a purpose. One of my guardians told me I have much work to do in the dreamworld so I'm getting busy on learning how. It is slow work. I'm scared to enter this realm. I'm not ready for this push of spiritual leadership in my life, but something greater than me is getting impatient. 
That's it in a nutshell.
.....'til next month......

"event","Aaaaahhhhh! The week before Christmas and the week after school got out - what a relaxing time. 
I'm almost done seeing family, one more day for that. That day will be a bit stressful because it's my mom and brothers. Unfortunately, we can't all be together at the same time. My mom is now the temporary foster parent of my brother's baby until the paternity test results come in. Until the results are in, my brother isn't allowed any contact with my mom while she has the baby (which is all the time). So for the holidays, I can visit with mom and the baby and then go visit my brothers at their apartment. Since we can't all be together, we can't do the family traditions together, which sucks. It's the one thing I look forward to when I visit at this time of year. Somethings in life just make you go: aaarrrrgggghhhh! But as some wise person said, ""this too shall pass"", I'll get over it.

Life at home is good, full of cooking and baking. Over the weekend we got a huge box of apples from some people at work. The entire box of apples has been turned into apple sauce and apple butter. It took me about a day and a half to finish it all up. It was nice. I get into a kinda 'zone' when I cook for long periods of time.
My daughter is doing well. The broken wrist hasn't slowed her down much. She has a determined spirit about her. If she really wants something, not much will stand in her way. I guess breaking her wrist is a lesson in creativity and perserverence. We try to make the most out of everything.
In other news, my step-daughter got engaged last week. I'm so happy for her. I think she's doing it right the first time. It's nice watching others live their lives. You get to see so much from standing on the side lines. Seeing her go from scrawny, angry teenager to a beautiful, independent, happy young woman is wonderful. 

My few friends sprawled around the US have been dropping notes. I may not hear from them all year, but come Christmas/Winter time, the cards/emails arrive. I can feel the strings inside me grow taut as people remember and think of me. Those bonds never do really die, just fade. Every year they are lines redrawn in my spiritual body and mind. Winter: a time for dying, but also a time for rebirth after a period of dormancy. I light a candle for all of them in remembrence of what was, is, and can be.

Happy Winter Solstice to everyone.

There's been so much food and outpouring of gifts. I like watching all the fun, games, and giving. It gives me hope for us all - at least until I turn on the news.

It has been a long week. I think it started last Friday. My daughter had her birthday celebration with all her friends on Saturday. We thought it would be nice to go skating, and it was nice for about an hour. Half way through the party my daughter fell and hurt her arm. I thought it was badly sprained, but no. Tuesday I get a call from the school nurse saying my daughter broke something in her wrist and I need to get her checked out. What a way to spend a birthday. On her actual birth day she was getting a cast. On the bright side, it's a fracture that may heal in 3-4 weeks rather than 8 weeks. On the down side, she gets to spend winter vacation in a cast. At least it's not summer when she'd want to swim. :sigh:

My long running week will continue at least through Sunday. Tomorrow morning I have two class parties to go to. Tomorrow night I have a mandatory Christmas party for work (who makes parties mandatory?). Saturday we have company coming and a Christmas party, so I get to clean and decorate the house. I get to do lots of baking for all these things. Cookies will be made for the class parties. Pies and spaghetti will be made for Saturday's party. Sunday morning is Christmas with said company, so there's wrapping to be done. Sunday day there's a family reunion - but I only have to bring fruit for that. And Monday? Monday I get to sleep late and make everyone eat leftovers. I'm tired just thinking about it. The holidays have their own kind of fun, and I love it; but I'm glad when it's over.

I hope everyone is having at least half the fun I am. I wish everyone lots of love, good company, good health, and of course, good food.

I mean, all things go in cycles, and I understand each season lends its importance to the earth and winter has a special place. For me, it just makes me groan that it's cold. I feel all the aches and pains I've ever had in one season. I do like the baking of winter, especially breads and cakes. I like the scenery of winter, as long as it's on the tv, in a book, or in a painting. Anyway, enough complaining about winter for one night.

The kids at school are starting to get that soft hyped up spirit. This is the only time of year I ever see it. They're hyper, but it has a gentleness to it. They sense the deadening of the world around them, the hunkering down for the cold season, the need to shelter and stock up. Deep down somewhere, even if they don't celebrate the winter season, they sense it is a season of dying and that they need to make the most of each person. They understand the giving spirit, the caring. They become vessels of sentiment willing to share a hug and smile with everyone. It is a beautiful time for humans. I think the stars shine brighter because of them, the kids.

Even though winter is a time of dying, my world is swirling. Preparations are being made for farewells, birthdays, anniversaries, family reunions, newcomers, school events, parties . . . the list could go on and on. I feel a sense of joy watching all the commotion, being a part of it. It gives life meaning to be a small part of so many. Even though I'm a small part, I'm an important part. I see the trails I leave through people's lives and am proud for the moments of joy, and realization, that I have helped to inspire. May everyone feel those tiny sparks of happiness in their lives.

Time to settle in. Winter's here and I must prepare, colors and decorations to be hung. Baking to be done. Love to give.

My Thanksgiving was good. I have a lot to be thankful for and got the chance to appreciate all of it up close and personal. Thanksgiving Day we did the traditional turkey with all the trimmings. The in-laws came over and we all had a pleasant time. While we were all together, we got phone calls from other family members. It was nice to pass around the phone and say hello. Friday was spent checking out thrift stores. There's a lot that's going to be needed for my brother's baby, so we looked for bargains. Saturday I got to meet my brother's baby. She's so small, only 4lbs 12oz. All the baby clothes we got are way too big. She's doing well. Not too many side effects from the drugs or the detox. Still has a little ways to go before she can come home. I spent all of Saturday with my mom, brothers, and my daughter. Lots of time spent being thankful, and celebrating birthdays. Everyone was grateful for acting like an adult. Maybe my family relations are on the mend. 
Today was spent reflecting, communing with nature, settling down on the inside. I have a lot of work still to get my mind where it needs to be. Thanksgiving was a good holiday to put things in perspective. Holidays in general bring out the worst, and best, inside us all. It'll give me a chance to work out the really hard stuff."

"event","Today is a good day. Even though I'm on day two of a migraine, the kids took care of me today. Sometimes they really surprise me. They can act like a bunch of ruffians, and other days they are sweet, caring, and hardworking. One boy in particular, I don't know what it is about him, but he sure knows how to push my buttons; today he worked so hard. He kept telling me he was bored and didn't like what we were doing. I told him I understood but it had to be learned (division) and the sooner we made it through, the quicker we could move on to another skill. He kept right on plugging along. He was so proud of himself when he finished. I told him it proved to me that he was smart and capable. I got a huge smile. Days like this make all the others worth it.

Baby news: So far the baby is doing well in detox. Apparently moving ahead real nice. Sunday morning her mom got released from the hospital, right into the arms of the authorities who took her back to her state where she is wanted on outstanding drug warrants. So, my brother is a single parent. He's got a few weeks breathing room until the baby comes home from detox. He doesn't have a place to live, so my mom is letting him move back home. They plan on taking shifts watching the baby. She works during the day, he watches the baby. He works at night, she watches the baby. Not something most grandma's sign up for. My brother not being responsible throughout his life, but most importantly these last few months will now impact an entire circle of people. My mom is too old to start over and it's not her responsibility. I wonder how far the ripples will spread?

And so, life goes on. I'm slowly, ever so slowly making changes in my life. I've started with my name. I'm finally cutting ties to the past and moving forward. I'm finally deciding I only have one family to take care of. I am reaching across the small gulf I've been looking across, grasping the hand that has been held outstretched for so long, allowing that person to help me across the divide, and fully realizing where I belong. 
I'm using calming techniques to deal with work better. Really trying to look at the kids and see some of them for who they really are - good and bad. I'm trying to picture how they see me and wondering if I'm showing them a kind, helpful teacher, or a monster.
I'm working my body - using weights the school offers to keep my strength up. If I feel strong, I can BE strong. I'm working on my flexibility, training to be fast and in control. If I feel flexible, if I feel in control, then I can BE those things. Perception can mean the world. 
I think somewhere deep inside I know I'm training for a marathon. I feel winter is not going to be kind to me. I'm going to have a lot of stressful events going on. One day at a time, baby steps all the way.

She stopped when she was supposed to. She'll be in the hospital for 30-90 days until she is weaned off the methidone that's being used for detox of her mom.

I had a friend apologize today, and at the same time thank me for being me. I'm truely touched and glad that things didn't end in a bad way. Often events in life don't work out the way you want, or plan, but there's always something valuable you can take away from the experience. There's a greater plan for each of us and I think we're on our way there. I'm hoping that I had a positive impact on my friend's life, and that in some way I nudged him in the right direction. I know I learned some valuable things for myself. Thank you.

Veteran's Day is tomorrow. No matter how you feel about the wars in the Mid-East, I would hope that you take a moment to thank those who protect our freedoms. They fight so we have the right to be who we are, hated or loved. Not only should you thank a veteran, but you should thank their family as well. Military life plays havoc on everyone in the family. Without the support of their children and spouses, many military members would find it difficult to carry on. We need warriors, because the human race, no matter how civilized they claim to be, are a warring species. We fight for the sake of fighting, for dominance, for material goods, for the rights of others, for peace. Without those willing to be aggressive, the rest of us would be slaves and serfs. Time and history prove this. Shake the hand of a veteran tomorrow, and maybe the day after too.

i'm moving on in life. i had a message from an unexpected source who said that i'm in a time of great change. so, i am beginning with myself. i'm taking short sabbaticals inside my mind and soul and seeing who i really am, if i like me, and coming to terms with all of me. i think by opening myself up more to people around me, i can withdraw deeper into my shell. makes no sense, right? but it does. if there is only surface area of me being shared, no one will miss the deeper pool of me. they will be too occupied with the surface information. this messenger suggested i begin by celebrating me, by calming myself, and cleansing away the worry and negative vibes that cloud my vision. the messenger has good advice.

my brother's baby has a C-section due date of November 24th. we all await with held breath. i have to say he's done well by his fiance. he's insisting she get into counseling programs and going with her. he's gotten her on WIC and checking out headstart. he's cleaning up a place for mom and baby to come home. i just hope it's not the nightmare the rest of the family fears. the rest of the family is beginning to come to terms with all of this. after some knock-down, drag-out fights (literally), things have cooled off. we're all trying to be the understanding shoulders for him to stand on. we'll see, we'll see.

When you have guests that have left their houses at the crack of dawn, with not much in their stomachs, serving them eggs from egg powder and mini pancakes just doesn't feel right. Running out of things to drink (water, soda, juice) with around 100 people gathered in 90 degree weather, some of them old and sick, well that's just not a good idea either. Leaving your sick, elderly parents and parents-in-law in the blazing sun for half an hour (before the ceremony even starts), especially when one has an oxygen hose, it's not a good thing.

You see what families are about, meet some you've never met, see some you'll never see again. You get a chance to contribute to the merriment of joining two lives together. But aside from the few special moments that occur, weddings are a royal pain in the ass. Sometimes seeing what a family is all about isn't always a pleasant thing. You get to see how selfish some are and know for sure how disappointing family bonds can be. I believe weddings have the ability to brings out both the very best and worst in people. I think today provided way too much information. I could've done without some of the eye opening experiences. Gee, other than that, the wedding was beautiful. Ha.

"event","Just when you get a handle on life, something comes up and smacks you in the head. I thought that I couldn't have a lower opinion of my brothers. I was so wrong. I found out tonight that my brother's fiance is pregnant. You'd think that would be good news, reason for congratulations all around. You'd think I was some jerk if I said I cried to hear the news, but they weren't tears of joy. My brother's fiance is wanted in another state on outstanding drug charges. She is evading her warrant by going to live with my brother. When she hooks up with my brother (she'd been gone for 10 months), he immediately takes her to the ER because her withdrawal symptoms are so bad she thinks she's gonna die. She's been using drugs while pregnant. Both of my brothers knew she was pregnant for months, both decided it would be better to tell my mother and I at the last moment about the pregnancy. I think the only reason they told us now is because fiance is back in town. I can't believe my brother went and got her pregnant. He knows she uses drugs. He knows she is supposed to be in jail serving a 5 year sentence. He knows her first child has been taken by the state she is currently wanted in, because she abandoned him. But no, I'm just being a bitch. My brother couldn't even take care of a dog. He made a poor choice and gave the dog to my other brother, who also couldn't take care of the dog. I had to go clean up their f------ mess. It's animal abuse when you don't feed the dog, don't take it out to go bathroom, and it lives in a one bedroom apartment that is filthy and has no AC. That dog didn't see the light of day for months. I had to be the bad guy and go get her. It was a very bad day. Now there will be a kid, in about 4 weeks. How the hell is that going to work? Am I gonna have to go get a kid now? My brother already said that if fiance leaves, like she's done before, and leaves the kid with him, he'll put her up for adoption because he can't take care of her. WTF?! He has no clue the kind of care this kid may need. Her mom was on drugs for the majority of the pregnancy. That can't possibly come out well. Why in the world would he do this? Now some poor kid may have to suffer grave consequences because of him. What an asshole."

"event","Yesterday went so well I was worried. Well, the other shoe dropped. By Monday we will have four more students. This doesn't really seem like a lot right? Oh, but it is. We have to arrange a lot of schedules. We have to add group lessons that normally I don't run by myself, but now I do. It's gotten to the point where if I take a day off, the lesson groups I run won't get done. There's just no one else to do it, and the teacher has her own lesson groups to run. It's a mess. Besides the new students, we found out we may have to temporarily share the classroom with another class. Don't really mind sharing, cause that's what this profession is all about, however, the chaos that will ensue will be phenomenal. We will have way too much. There is absolutely no down time. Any other job you're required to take two ten minute breaks plus your half hour lunch. There are no such things as breaks for us and sometimes lunches come and go without eating. I'm thinking more than one shoe has fallen.

The afternoon was good. Got to catch up with a friend who needs a strong shoulder. It's nice to be able to carry her because I know she feels so lost. On a selfish note, it felt good to be emotionally useful to someone else. It made us both smile.

Lets see, that leaves the evening. Yeah, that didn't go so well. You'd think after working out for a period of time, I'd get better. It doesn't seem to be happening. I think I'm going in reverse. I'm actually shying away instead of stepping up. My shying away seems to really piss off my workout partner. Maybe he thought he saw something that isn't really there. Maybe he thought I'd learn something instead of always reverting back to what is comfortable to me. I guess it's time for me to stop having fun and get to work, because I've found this week's workouts difficult to manage. I've hit a low spot and can't find the motivation to move forward. Instead of fighting my way up, I just wanted to curl up and cry. It took more energy to fight that urge than to follow thru on technique. Sheesh, not tough enough--how tough am I gonna be curled up on the floor crying? yep.

Second, we had a switching around of students that could have been really nasty, but so far isn't. Third, there was a shortage of substitutes for the teachers' workshop and I was lucky enough not to be pulled. Today at work went so well it's scary. Things never go this well. I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.

The afternoon went pretty well too. I got a few things done that needed doing. I got to work out and I thought the exercise was pretty good. I worked up a sweat, my muscles hurt, and I'm tired. All good signs. 

My family is in good shape. Homework got done on time. People went to bed on time (except for me). No hassles, no arguments, and moments of clarity and strength were shared - this has been a good day/evening.

Now all that's left, is to sort out the muddle of a mess inside my head and I'll be good to go. Yuppers, good to go.

Winging a class by the seat of your pants when you can't think through the fog of a bone-crushing headache is a lot to ask. Somehow I managed to teach a science, and a math, lesson without stringing any children up. Overall, I count that as a good day. Yay me.

I ate a good breakfast, had all my stuff together, left plenty of time to get to the testing site.  I get in the room, and other than two of the proctors, I'm the oldest living thing in the room.  I think, ok-I can do this. We're all told to open the test booklet and fill in the info about ourselves.  There are only 5 of us who can follow the directions.  The rest of the students had to erase and redo putting us behind 10 minutes.  I guess getting old has one perk, I've learned how to follow simple directions.  If the group I saw in the test room is any indication of the youth that will be running the world, we are all in some really DEEP crap!  We went through the test:  Reading, Math, English, Science, and the Writing.  I suck at math and science.  Out of 60 questions, I got to number 47 when the 5 minute limit was called.  Yeah, a lot of my answers are C's.  It was the letter I chose to fill in all the blanks.  That happened on two of the tests.  Just about everyone else in the room is done and here I am Christmas treeing the last 13 friggin problems.  So I think, these people can't follow simple directions (a problem we had throughout the test), but they can tell you if angle A is equal to angle C if the tangent is some such number.  WTF?!  I'm just old.  I was one of 7 who had all the correct materials.  The other students couldn't remember to bring a regular #2 pencil.  They are coming to take a test to get into college, but can't remember a pencil--what the hell is that?  Yes, I'm old and intolerant. Really intolerant.  yep.

They just couldn't control themselves, bouncing around, mouths going a mile a minute.  Others were quiet because they were afraid of the thunder.  Can't say I blame them.  Some of the booms rattled the windows. 
I feel so mellow, like I'm dream-walking.  The world looks a little unreal.  It's not good to be like this.  I have too much to do.  Part of my mood is because of the rain, part because I haven't slept well in a couple of weeks, and part because autumn is coming.  I can smell it on the wind.  Autumn is such a nostalgic time for me.  Memories flood me and I live half in the past and half in the present.  The Harvest Moon is tonight.

Sometimes I'll go to the well and peer into the tiny hole, but as I get closer the hole seems just right to fit my head in.  I lean in a little farther and find that my shoulders will slide through, and if they fit then so does my whole body.  At first going into the well seems comforting because it is warm and dry - like being wrapped in a soft blanket.  I am lulled into a semi-content feeling which seems to deepen the farther down I go.  Then time stops - all goes quiet and then the tingling, itching sensation begins.  I'm quickly becoming uncomfortable and think now is a good time to leave the well; but, I'm stuck.  I can't get out.  The tingling awakens other senses; I feel everyone.  I can feel thoughts pricking at my mind.  I feel the energy of their bodies pushing against mine.  I don't like being able to feel so much of them.  I get agitated and antsy.  When the feeling intensifies to where it is almost unbearable, I drop into the bottom of the well.  The bottom of the well is velvet dark and cold - a cold air blows; but, it ignites my fires and I light up the dark with anger.  I begin to rage at the world, hating everyone and everything.  I feel like I'm caught in a sandstorm - the stinging sand biting into my skin, whirling sand blinding me and whipping me around in all directions.  I feel like I'm in a panic and I can't calm down.

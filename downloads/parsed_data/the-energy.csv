"event","i haven't updated in forever.  it probably doesn't matter, but i know patricia would want to read i suppose so i'll update.

plus i'm bored out of my mind because i've been cleaning and i want a break.

<lj-cut text=""no idea how long this will be"">

so yea, i've been cleaning most of the day, and you can actually see a difference.  for some reason whenever i clean other days it never seems to look cleaner in the end, but today it does.  probably has something to do with actually cleaning the trash off the floor and vacuming up the rest.  it feels good to have it clean, i can't wait til she gets home and sees what i've done and feels good about it.

what have i been up to?  working and feeling like a loser.  all i do is work at home depot and spend time with my gf.  i actually don't feel that bad about it.  i love spending all my free time with her, especially since it's been pretty good lately, i lover her.  i just want the job to be different.  but i'm SERIOUSLY making progress to change that, so i feel good.  i got a promotion of sorts at work.  sorta ... kinda ... i'm the lot in-focus leader which means i'm in charge of safety and security issues in my department.  nothing huge, but the point is i'm actually in a leadership position now which means i'm much more likely to move up in the store now ... probably in a year and i'll have been moved on by then.  haha.

i have no idea what to write.

i've discovered a horrible thing, direct deposit advances.  basically if i have no money in my bank account i can forward 20 bucks at a time in my account, it costs $2 per forward.  but i got into it too much and now i basically spend my whole paycheck before i get paid.  so i have to do more advances which just causes an endless cycle.  but i hope to get out of it.  i was dumb this last pay period though, i did way too much because i wanted to take patricia out to dinner a few times now i'm worried i won't have any for valentines or our anniversary, but i'll figure it out, anyway ....

do we all need private places to vent?  hidden even from those we love the most?  eh, nevermind ... 

hmm ... yea i'm bored and have nothing else to say.  i haven't updated in months and nothing more has happened than a couple of paragraphs.  my life is fucking boring."

on December 10, 11, and 12 I'll be home in Fremont!  I'm so excited.  I don't know specific times yet, but I'll be leaving on a place with my gf and mom sometime that Friday morning on the 10th, then have all Friday and Saturday to hang out and show Patricia where I used to live and the sights.  then Sunday I have a brunch with my grandpa (it's a Christmas yearly thing, the real reason I'm going down) then I'll probably have a few hours tops on Sunday before I have to leave that night to come back home.  but I'll be so happy.  I'll get like no sleep Friday night so I can wake up early and have a shitload of time on Saturday.

so all my friends who are perhaps reading this, since I'll be down I'd love to see you if I get the chance.  so far the only plans I have (and they can easily be changed.  i'm thinking that the time available friday will be spent in fremont, maybe going to a movie, seeing old friends, going to bay street, and my old high school, stuff like that.  Saturday is a San Francisco day, exploratorium, and whatever else to do there in san fran.  sunday, whatever time is left i don't know, more friend time, there maybe be only a couple hours there, maybe more, so i'm not sure.  

<h3>friends, please comment if you have any idea if you're available dec 10th in the evening cause i'd love to see some of my old friends.</h3>"

"event","ok, hopefully this entry won't get too long but i have to write this.  something very sad has happened.  my cat, lucky, has died.  

long story short, she's been feeling sick, we went to the vet, we were unable to save her so we have to put her down.  

i've spent the last hour digging a hole to bury her in, and it's finally done.  

i can't believe my cat is gone forever, i loved her so much.  she's been around about as long as i can remember.  i've had her since i was 4, that makes her 15 years old.  yes, i know she was old, and it was probably her time to go, and i know i did the right thing by putting her out of her misery, but that doesn't make it easier really.  

she's always been around, and i'll always miss her.  she was very special to me and i still don't think i've really realized she's gone.  it just hasn't hit me yet.  this is the first time in my ENTIRE life that i do not own a cat.  from the time i was born til now there has always been at least 1 cat with me.  i don't look forward to this really hitting me.




i need to give and extremely special thanks (again) to my old friend liz.  liz, if it wasn't for you she'd be gone long ago, and the last year or two of her life wouldn't have been so wonderful.  it was solely because of you liz that she was made happier than she ever was in her life, and gave her a chance to move up here to oregon with us so she can have all the space and nature up here she loves.  thank you liz, thank you from the bottom of my heart for making it possible for lucky to die with her last memories being happy ones, instead of a life of general pain and hatred by other cats.

got a bunch of pics from it.  and they weren't even at the peak.  it snowed like two more inches.  and on top of the hill like 1/4 mile away it snowed like 6 or 7 inches.  it was only like 3 here.

but i wanted to update because i got two weird messages from nicki in my e-mail.  one was this.  and yes they were all in caps 

""I AM A HURTFUL PERSON. BUT I HURT MYSELF IN THIS PROCESS THIS WEEK. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS WEEK.""

so whatever the fuck that means.  it almost sounds apologetic you know?  saying she's hurtful means she knows she hurt me or something, and saying she hurt herself in the process, i don't know.  she'll never forget this week?  i have no fucking clue what's going on.

then i got one, i'm not sure if it's the second one or the first one since i got them yesterday, but here's this one ... all caps again

""SOME OTHER GIRL WILL RUIN YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART TO."" 

the only friend i have there is jon, and he wouldn't be stupid enough to go for nicki, wtf?  she didn't have the heart to?  

i'm rather curious to find out what she's talking about, but i'm afraid if i ask her i'm gonna get a world of hurt.  now i'm trapped cause ... what if she is sorry for everything?  regrets leaving me and going off and doing drugs?  and wants to give it a second chance.  then again what if she's just acting that way so we'll have a conversation and she can be really mean to me.  i don't know what's going on.  

i think i may text just to ask what happens, but i'll not wait around for it.  i'll text, then leave the room for a few hours to calm back down so i can handle it better when i come back.

"event","i'm having like an epiphany here.  i'm listening to a song and it helps me think in more depth about this idea that i've had lately.  
here's some lyrics, and i know most of you just skip over lyrics, but i'll keep them to a min and it'll help you see where i got the idea for this ... idea.

This is from Jewel - A life Uncommon

Lend your voices only to sounds of freedom
No longer lend your strength to that which you wish to be free from
Fill your lives with love and bravery
And you shall lead a life uncommon
Set down your chains, until only faith remains
There are plenty of people who pray for peace
But if praying were enough it would have come to be
Let your words enslave no one and the heavens will hush themselves
To hear our voices ring out clear
With sounds of freedom
To live, we must give
No longer lend our strength to that we wish to be free from
Fill your lives with love and bravery
And we shall lead a life uncommon 

And this is Papa roach - Lovehatetragety

Human behavior, peculiar it seems
some thrive on hate
and some love and dream

ok, the idea.

especially that line, ""no longer lend our strength to that we wish to be free from"".  i do this.  personaly, i have always been strong.  i know myself, i know what i want.  i'm intensly passionate.  i have a strong sense of self and who i am.  insanely stubborn about it too.  i think to compensate for this enormous amount of power i have over myself and my thought, i completely give myself to another.  this goes along with personal views of love and connection to another human being, but as we see this is what i do.  i let nicki have all the power over me for the longest time, and i refused to take that power back, i wanted her to have it.  despite my strength in myself, my own comfort with me being who i am, it seems i refused to do anything but give her control over me.  and i liked it that way.  honestly i still do but the problem is the person i lend my power to usualy abuses it.  so perhaps i should be hesitant about it.  but that's not the point of this, that was just to say i reconize this in myself
the idea is we all do this.  but it's not always a person.  we give all our strength to something in some way.  some people they give all they're power to temptation.  some people give all their power to work, or weed, or some idea of the way they think the world should be.  it seems so stupid that we give all the power for us to an idea.  when we should be giving all the power for ourselves ... to ourselves.  we are the only ones that should have the power over us, at least until we find a healthy idea, or a good person you can trust.  don't give all our strength to some idea that kills us and holds us back.
i like it, if we fill our lives with love and bravery, and take our strength back and put it in ourselves, along with let our voices only speak of freedom, we truly will lead ""lives uncommon"" and it'll be allright.  

i need to do this, but it's harder than it looks.  i still want to give my power to some one because, well, even with all my confidence in myself, i am human and so crave contact, and love, and connection with others.  i am not smart enough to understand if there's a way to keep all my power, and yet still have a close connection, the kind i'm looking for.  perhaps i'll someday figure it out.  
thinking about it though, i don't need to figure it out.  this way works just fine, the problem is i cant find anybody who will understand that my strength is a gift, and theirs is a gift to me, and it's to cherish.  it's always one way hoping it will someday be both ways.  i've only had one way relationships.  it's always for them, not us.  i hope there is some one out there who knows themselves well enough to think that idea is right for them as well.

now i just need to find them ..."

"event","ok, here's something funny that i found in all my stuff.  i said i'd write it a while ago, and here it is.  it's funny ... 

------------------------

A letter to you from Satan

  I saw you yesterday as you began your daily chores.  You awoke without kneeling to pray.  As a matter of fact, you didn't even bless your meals, or pray before going to bed last night.  You are so unthankful, i like that about you.

  I cannot tell you how glad i am that you have no changed your way of living.  Fool, you are mine.  Remember, you and i have been going steady for years, and i still don't love you yet.  As a matter of fact, i hate you, because i hate God.  I am only using you to get even with God.  He kicked me out of heaven, and i'm going to use you as long as possible to pay him back.  

  You see, fool, GOD LOVES YOU and HE has great plans in store for you.  But you have yeilded your life to me, and i'm going to make your live a living hell.  That way, we'll be together twice.  This will really hurt God.  Thanks to you, i'm really showing him who's boss in your life with all the good times we've had.

  We have been watching dirty movies, cursing people out, stealing, lying, being hypocritical, fornicating, overeating, telling dirty jokes, gossiping, being judgemental, back stabbing people, disrespecting adults, and those in leadership positions, no respect for the church, and having bad attitudes.

  SURELY you don't want to give all this up.  Come on, fool let's burn together forever.  I've got some hot plans for us.  This is just a letter of appreciation from me to you.  I'd like to say ""THANKS"" for letting me use you for your most foolish life.

  You are so gullible, i laugh at you.  When you are tempted by sin, you give in. HA HA HA!  You make me sick.  Sin is beginning to take it's toll on your life.  You look 20 years older, and now i need new blood.  So go ahead and teach some children how to sin.  All you have to do is smoke, get drunk or drink while underaged, cheat, gamble, gossip, fornicate, and live being as selfish as possible.  Do all of this in the presence of children and they will do it too.  Kids are like that.

  Well, fool, I have to let you go for now.  I'l be back in a couple of seconds to tempt you again.  If you were smart, you would run somewhere, confess your sins, and live for God with what little bit of life you have left.  It's not my nature to warn anyone, but to be your age and still sinning, it's becoming a bit ridiculous.  Don't get me wrong, i still hate you.  

IT'S JUST THAT YOU'D MAKE A BETTER FOOL FOR CHRIST.

signed
Satan

P.S. If you really love me, you won't share this letter with anyone."

"event","oh, fuck fuck fuck.  

so i went to the coffee place to ask the girl out.  she wasn't there.  but aparently her friend was there.  and i got some stats on this girl.

25
1 kid
got engaged last weds on her birthday 

= NO CHANCE! hahah

so oh well.  but the lady aparently was her best friend, and she said she'd be very flattered.  and she's always looking for new friends, they're very welcome, so she thought i should come and ask her to coffee anyway.
it was kind of embarassing because i ask her if she knew the lady who worked there yesterday and when the next time she was coming in.  she said, ""oh, got a little crush on her huh?"" i denied it cause well it's not a crush, i don't even know her name, we just got along well enough i thought for a date.  haha.  
anyway, that was a bust.  but i am very happy i even had to courage to drive up THINKING she was there.  and ask her friend about her so smoothly, not all stuttering and stuff.  
when i got home i had an urge to call angela again, but since then it's gone away.  oh well.

damnit."

"event","warning.  now that i've looked through the stuff that used to be on my walls, i want to share.  so i'll be putting some stuff up.  it's reading material, but a lot of it is inspiring and really worth reading.  i hope you actualy read it. 

<lj-cut text=""couple poems and a comic thing that i'm typing out"">

""will the real you please stand up""

submit to pressure from peers and you move down to their level.  speak up for your own beliefs and you invite them up to your level.  if you move with the crowd, you'll get no further than the crowd.  when 40 million people believe in a dumb idea, it's still a dumb idea.  simply swimming with the tide leave you nowhere.  so if you believe in something that's goo, honest, and right; stand up for it.  maybe you're peers will get smart and drift your way

a comic of calvin and hobbes.  i have no idea which is which, so the kid is calvin and the cat thing is hobbes.  i think that might be right .. hobbes doesn't seem right for a kid.  anyway ... 

calvin: today at school i tried to decide whether to cheat on my test or not.  i wondered ""is it better to do the right thing, and fail... or do the wrong thing and succeed?""  On the one hand undeserved success gives no satisfaction.  but on the other hand well deserved failure gives no satisfaction either.  of course almost everybody cheats at some time or other.  people always bend the rules if they think they can get away with it.  ... then again that doesn't justify MY cheating.  then i thought ""look, one little test isn't such a big deal.  it doesn't hurt anyone.""  but then i wondered if i was just rationalizing my unwillingness to accept the fact i didn't study.  still, in the real world people care about success not principles.  ... then again maybe that's why the world is such a mess.  what a dilema!! 
Hobbes: so what did you decide to do?
Calvin: Nothing.  i ran out of time and had to turn in a blank paper.  
Hobbes: simply acknowledging the issue is a moral victory
Clavin: Well, it just seemed wrong to cheat on an ethics test.

hahahah, i love that comic.  its' wonderful.  hehehe

ok, last comic, then poems, bout a kid and the last day of school.

board says last day of school, have a nice summer. 
teacher: I know how dearly you love school pasquale ... but summer vacation STARTED5 minutes ago outside!  you wouldn't want to be ... TARDY, would you?
Pasquale: well if you put it THAT way i guess i can live with it.
teacher: see you in september

haha, cody gave this to me cause i was the same way.  i loved school and just never wanted to leave.  

ok, poem time.  

actualy, nevermind.  i was gonna put one of mine up, but i'll just put that favorite one in my info.  and the other one isnt' worth it.  so i'll just post this like list of ... well here it is 

""if i had my life to live over"" by erma bombeck

i would have talked less and listened more
i would have invited friends over to dinner even if the carpet was stained and the sofa faded
i would have eaten the popcorn in the ""good"" living room and wories much less about the dirt when some one wanted to light a fire in the fireplace
i would have taken the time to listen to my grandfather ramble about his youth
i would never have insisted the car windows be rolled up on a summer day because my hair had just been teased and sprayed.
i would have burned the pink candle sculpted like a rose before in melted in storage.  
i would have sat on the lawn with my children and not worried about the grass stains
i would have cried and laughed less while watching telivision and more while watching life
i would ahve gone to bed when i was sick instead of pretending the earth would go into a holding pattern if i weren't there for a day
i would have never bought anything just because it was practical, wouldn't show soil, or was guranteed to last a lifetime
instead of wishing away nine months of pregnancy i'd have cherished every momen realizing the wonderment gorwing inside me was the only chance to assist god in a miracle
when my kids kissed me impetuously i would never have said ""later, now go wash up for dinner""
there would have been more ""i love you""'s ... more ""i'm sorry""'s 

but mostly given another shot at life, i would seize every minute ... look at it and really see it ... live it ... and never give it back.  
-- in honor of erma bombeck who lost her fight with cancer

that's a very powerful thing to me.  i love it very much.

these are the things i put on my walls.  they're not fancy paintings, they're not odd sculpters.  they're not weird peices of whatever that are sold by the masses.  they are something inspiring, something deep and important we should all listen to.  i want these things on my wall to remind me to live life to it's fullest.  i took them down because i felt i had already, but here i am, still with a beating heart, so it must not be over.  so back up they go.  to further inspire me to achieve great things in my life.  

i hope i make it a worthwhile one.

and also later i will type something up called ""a letter to you from satan"" that is pure gold.  i think i'll do that tomorrow.  my hands hurt cause i've been typing for hours in weird positions with cats sleeping on me.  well cat, singular.  so good-night"

the cat still isn't better.  she's been on the meds 10 days and not a major result.  she's a little better today, but we'll see what happens.  she's been causing mischief lately, but she is a kitten so i'm not surprised.  she eats a lot, but it's ok
my dad visited this weekend.  it's nice to see him.  we played pool for a couple hours.  i miss him.  i hope he can move up here soon.

Nicki texted me today from her phone to my e-mail.  she's being nice to me so i don't know what to think.  i'd like to think she was just annoyed and is now over it, but i'm still not sure what to make of it.  i knwo she has me blocked on her sn as i have her blocked too.  i suppose it makes no difference.  no contact and with her being terrible to me (not that i didn't deserve it) has finally made me remove her from my life.  however, i know it could be easy to get her back into my psyche if she wanted to be there.  oh well.  so we're talking through e-mails at the moment, sentence at a time.  not sure how i feel about it.  i know it makes me want a cigarette, but it's been like 3 days for that anyway so it's no wonder i want one on the first place.

i went to this craft fair that portland has every weekend for 9 months of the year.  it was nice.  got lots of little boothes with all sorts of handmade stuff the people make.  i went specifically for a ring because i got rid, well packed away, the ring that was nicki's and my 1 year anniversary ring.  but like i said i felt naked without it, so i wanted a different one.  i went around to the different stores and looked at everything.  eventualy got down to three different rings.  i also got a necklace, and i really like it.  it's got a big peace symbol, which is nice, and a yin-yang in the middle which i'm trying to incorporate in my life.  i want this thing around me to inspire peace and balance into me, so the necklace was already fantastic, but then i noticed on the top beads a circle with a dot in the middle.  which in case any of you know i have a weird form of symbol writing, weird stuff, but anyway, a circle with a dot in the middle is supposed to represent the universe, and balance, and wisdom.  when i had the symbol for my name Mercimelis Lithecrim Viracocha that was the 2nd symbol that stood for wisdom.  so this necklace was perfect.  although the symbol was in the name ""mercimelis"" the symbol alone does not stand for mercimelis, so it's not going backwards or anything.  also got a nifty little keychain from this son and mom who make stuff out of clay.  so here's a picture of the three.

yea, and one last thing.  i called that girl that one night, and it just rang and rang.  tried a couple times.  and that was like last weds.  how am i gonna make friends if i don't actualy call anyone?  i feel stupid.  i'm gonna call her tomorrow.  i think she had this thing today, if i recall this being the right day.  

ugh, i feel like shit today, honestly.  i need a cigarette."

"event","i hate my fucking mother.
i'm trying to get a job.  like seriously, i'm going out, i'm driving, i'm turning in applications, i'm looking for places that are hiring.  and all she does is bitch.
this morning apparently at 10 she woke me up and said that the CLackamas Target has a big sign that says their hiring.  i said ok, i'll go today, but i don't remember any of this.  i woke up at 1.  i couldn't sleep last night and ended up in bed at 5.  so no wonder i didn't remember at 10.  she's getting completely pissed off that i didn't remember.  she gets so annoyed that i sleep late and that i can't remember anything.  fucking bitch, it's not my fault.  it's not my fault that i have insomnia and can't sleep until fucking 5 in the morning.  it's not my fault i can't remember any fucking thing anymore.  it annoys me just as much as it annoys her.  goddamn, i would love to go to sleep at 10 and wake up at 6, and have the memory i used to have, but i can't fucking do it.  she claims, ""oh just get in bed at 10 and you'll adjust your shedule.""  you try going to bed at 3pm!  i'd toss in bed for hours until at least 2.  and during that time i'd want to scream because i'm so uncomfortable.  it actualy hurts to lay in bed awake that long.  i've become fucking resistant to my sleeping pills in less than a week, so those don't even help anymore.  if i go to sleep late, and wake up early, i can't function that day and i need to function.  if i stay up all night it makes no difference.  i swear, i've fucking done it before.  i wake up at 2 i stay up all the next night, and i'm exhausted all day, but big fucking surprise, when nighttime comes around i'm awake again, so it doesn't matter.  i go to sleep at like 3 instead of 5.  big whoop, and then i have to make up for the sleep i missed the night before and wake up at 2 anyway.  it's just fucking nighttime, makes me wide awake, i'm tired all day, but nightfall wakes me up.  i hate it.
so i asked if it was the target that i talked to the guy and he said they weren't hiring or the one i did the electronic application at.  she said the one i did the application at.  i know that you're not supposed to do the application more than 90 days at a time, and i only did it like 3 weeks ago tops.  i told her about the 90 days thing and she yells in my face ""THEN I'LL GO DOWN AND DO IT FOR YOU!!"" .... wtf?  i never raised my voice, i was never disobedient, not like i care about that anyway.  all i did was explain a fact.  now i can go down and try for an appointment or something, but she was talking about applications which i can't do.  and she just yells in my face.  
i'm serious when i say this, there's a lot of love in the family, and between me and my mom, but she's more bitch than mom.  i've dealt with this for years and she's just a terrible person now.  i can't stand her.  i honestly try to avoid her as much as possible, she's just plain stupid.  
so she yelled at me some more basically saying ""if you were really trying you would have gotten up right when i said they were hiring and gone down there"" ... wtf?  if i was so tired i couldn't even remember it it's no surprise i didn't have the thought process to get up and drive.  
she's all complaining that i do nothing and she's paying for everything.  which is true, but goddamn it's not like i'm not trying my hardest.  i bothered the fuck out of that guy at target on tuesday.  i even suckumed to applying for a job at borders ... i fucking hate reading and hate even being aroudn copious amounts of books.  i drive around in circles.  i went to petsmart like 5 times just to be told ""ok, we're not hiring but we'll file this for when we are"".  it takes half an hour to drive there by the way.  no fucking way she can't say i'm not trying considering i have insomnia, i'm fat and so no fucking energy, i'm depressed still, i have no friends, no life, no nothing.  there's nothing to keep me happy besides myself up here and we all know how well that works.  i'm doing the best i can considering what's going on.  

i hate my mother.

so now excuse me while i go get ready to get an interview.

oh, and btw, i'm a little worried that if i get this job, and the other new target job, what's going to happen.  i want the wilsonville one (the new store) so i guess i'll just call the other target and say i found a better job.  then again, aparentl they're only hiring full time people at the new store, so maybe i could work at 2 stores and that way i could have full time or more.  ... hmm ... i gotta ask them about that."

so i'm listening to my music and missing my friends.  i wish julie were here.  i wish i could hang out with my mission friends like at that superbowl party.  
but instead i get to sit here alone, waiting for call backs from jobs that may never come. 
in the last 8 months my best friends have been loneliness, depression, and thoughts of suicide.  heh, just being a little poetic there.

"event","ugh.  don't know if i said this already on the other journal, but i put up a personal add on a local portland site, and i got a response.  i was all excited that some one responded and what i found out about the girl is her name is Lisa Emery and she's 42 and insane.  there were definite times where i doubted her stability as a human being.  that was like 2 weeks ago now, maybe longer.  anyway, she said she'd call me the next day but she never did.  i hoped she realized that she's 42 and i'm 18 (she can't read, i said i was 18 very first thing in the add) and so she gave up trying to chat with me.  well tonight i got a message from the same girl asking me to call her back.  wtf?  i'm kinda annoyed and scared.  well not scared.
i won't call back, but my problem is i hate not calling some one back on purpose if they're expecting my call.  grr.  i just got over screening my calls!"

"event","i realized i have a real problem with smoking and it's not the one that you'd normaly think.  not about that i can't quit, although that seems true, but that i do my best thinking while smoking.
i smoke outside, and while i'm inside i'm on the comp or doing something, or paying attention to the cat or on the phone or whatever.  it's not become that smoking is my only time when i go outside, relax with some introspection, think about life and some new ideas, come up with stuff.  it seems i need this time to relax and enjoy life believe it or not.  i've tried just sitting outside and not smoking to think, and it doesn't really work.  nothing else or no other place really is as good in providing me with thinking time as sitting outside and smoking.  
perhaps this is all just an unconscious way for me to continue smoking, maybe not.  but at the moment i think i do want to continue, lightly, but i do.  it's still my only real stress relief and thinking time.  
i will quit, but not right now i suppose.  hopefully the strong idea will hit me and i will stop, but in the meantime, i live in a happy little cloud of smoke.  
haha, i'll stop if i get a gf who disaproves, that's for sure, no issue.  

ok, i'm off to clean or whatever.  now i just have the problem of the cat sleeping on me ...."

<lj-cut text=""just a couple other things so far today"">

well, i went back to the target thing and bothered that guy Jason.  i feel bad about bothering him so much.  i waited around for him to be done with an interview.  i explained a couple things and said what i was willing, not just wanted.  he said he'd go back and add it to the application, so i was happy about that.  going back out to my car i remember this other thing i wanted to tell him, so i went back in to talk to Jason, haha.  outside though there was this guy that i talked to on my first time in, i asked him if Jason was in there so i didn't waste my time.  i talked to him for a few minutes this time.  i told him what was going on with me for the target.  he says he just transfered here from Massechusets .. sp? .. and he had the same fear i do.  i already work for target but there might be no jobs available up here, so i might lose the job.  we talked for a while about other stuff too.  his name was Randy but i don't actualy know if he's working at the new store or what he does.  Jason is going to be the etl of assets protection.  did i already say that?  whatever.  so i went back in and told him the other thing.  i get the feeling i annoyed him, but i really want that job and feel comfortable there, i want to make sure everything is right.  so now i've done everything possible and all i can do is wait for that call telling me if i have a job.  oh well.  i hope hope hope.

i can't get this girl Angela off my mind.  i'm going to call tonight.  it's pretty funny, i fell asleep yesterday and i had like 5 dreams involving her in some way.  haha.  it's probably just cause it's been so long that i've been physically near some one my age, and it's some one in the area.  i'm all happy i might have a new friend you know, so it's pretty big to me.  i hope she actualy wants to be friends, otherwise it'll be really weird.  i bet she thinks i'm older than i am that's why she was slightly weird when i asked her number.  

anyway, that's about all for today.  i'm really hungry, i didn't sleep last night, but i presently have a cat sleeping on me.  it's so annoying.  she's so sweet, but she does not sleep unless she can be by me or on me.  i can't sit at my computer chair without her wanting to be on me.  i get no private time with this cat, it's like a 2 year old, haha.  i have to lock her out of my bedroom if i dont' feel like having a cat on me.  haha.  but then she meows the entire time.

yea, that's it."

"event","ok, well i have so much to say about today and thoughts recently that i really shouldn't say them because honestly, i want people to read my journal and not many people are willing to spend 10 minutes reading a journal entry, so i'll make it blunt.  

first thing i want to say is i chose all the icons for this journal.  you can look here http://www.livejournal.com/allpics.bml?user=the_energy hopefully you take the 3 seconds to look 'em over, and let me know what you think.  i like my default one, it's yin-yang, but a really fancy one, so i enjoy it.  it's also my background on my comp now.  the other one to me looks like what heaven would be, but it's also ""the energy"" to me.  it's got this high spirituality thing to it, i just like it a lot.  the death and dying one is mainly for when i'm in bad moods.  but i think it's funny cause it's all in happy and upbeat colors even though is says ""death and dying"" haha.

ok, today.  i went to the target mass hiring thing.  no luck.  well actualy sorta.  long story short, the guy loved me.  i got about 30 ""outstandings"" from the guy.  His name was jason and he was going to be the Executive Team Leader of Assets Protection.  he was great.  i really impressed him.  but i found out a few things that might not be good for me.  one, their not hiring full time, and i wanted full time, and so since i said it, i might not get it.  however, i am going back tomorrow to say ""look, i want a job, i'll takes what i can get, ya know?""  so anyway, also for some reason they're hiring the flow team, stock and pricing teams, and night crews first before everybody else.  so he couldn't hire me right then.  ""we'll call you back"" which worries the fuck out of me, i mean they'll call me back?  i knew i was the most qualified person there for what they wanted and i was applying for.  which is part of the reason i'm going back.  things that may have prevented me from being hired right then, i want full time, there is no full time for my level of employment, i asked for 7.50 even though they pay 6.90 at first, but i explained i'll take what i can get.  i know there was somethign else i dont' remember, so yea.  but i as i said, i'll go back and explain a little more.  i think i'll get a job no matter what, but it still majorly worries me that ""they'll call me back"".  i don't see how i can't get a job.  hell, i have recomendations from my previous store, i HAD a previous store and wasn't fired, i even helped set up that damn store like we're setting up this one, and it's not like i worked at target for a month, it's was almost a year.  and i'm GOOD at what i do.  so yea.

oh, i found out something weird.  they don't have garden sections in oregon.  i never heard of that.  haha.  no garden section?  trippy.  

i was kinda pissed.  my mom did the same thing, the whole mass hire thing, and SHE GOT HIRED! ... goddamnit.  i had way more qualifications than her, but because i was applying for cart attendant first, i didn't get hired then, and i may not get hired, pisses me off.  my mom didn't even want the job, it's a backup, grrrr.  so she got hired as a sales floor person, which is my 2nd choice job.  i made cashier 3rd.  i'm good at it, and they know i am, i do everything wonderful, but i've been doing it for so long now i want a change.  and i'm better at cart attendant that cashier, and (this sounds really dumb but ... ) it's like my dream job.  i always wanted to be cart attendant, hahahaah.  i'm fucked up.  

but one really good thing came from all this today, i got a girls number.  she was the only person ahead of my mom in line.  we sort of acknowledged each other.  but in the waiting room and decided to go for it and sit next to her.  we talked and got along pretty well.  it was fun.  she is oh so sexy, and very sweet.  there's only one problem with her, and i won't mention it here, haha, ask me if you want to know.  so as she was done with her interview and about to leave i asked if she had a sn or a phone number where i could reach her at she said ""i don't really do the only thing, but you can have my number"" i said great, and i gave her mine cause i didn't want it to be like ""yea, i have your number, just to make you feel good for a day til you realize i'll never call"".  things should be even.  oh, and i will call.  haha.  so i'm pretty happy about that.  i'll probably call tomorrow.  not sure if i should call morning or afternoon or evening.  but anyway.  even if nothing happens, i'm happy to at least have some one i know in the area who's NOT 42!! haha.  

anyway, that's all."

<h1><marquee>SWEEEET!!</marquee></h1>

so yea, here's what i did today.  i woke up early, well 11:30, same thing, so that my mom and i could do a bunch of stuff.  

um... give me a sec to remember ... 
<lj-cut>

oh yea!  first thing i did was go to my sisters house because she's away and i'm supposed to be feeding her cat.  so i went there and took care of that.  next we went to this ferret show.  it's supposed to be a bunch of people and their pet ferrets in costumes and stuff like that prancing around.  but when we got there it was really small, i only saw like 10 ferrets, none were dressed up, and the only thing going on was an auction for ferret stuff.  we walked around for no more than 10 minutes and decided it sucked ass, so we left.  well i thought it sucked ass, mom thought it ""wasn't very good"" haha.  old people.  
then we went up to this place joane's or something that's a fabric store that my mom wants to work at.  they said they were hiring, which is good for her.  she tried finding this kind of fabric but it wasn't there.  after that we went to wendy's for breakfast.  up here they have something different on the 99 cent menu!  it's called the 1/4 point double delux something.  i got it.  and it was allright, but the jr. bacon cheeseburger was so much better.  show me from deviating from my normal menu.  haha.  every time i get something different there i'm always unsatisfied, i should just give up.  
anyway, after that we went down to this new target and costco.  i bought some CD-Rs because i gotta burn some stuff.  also to look at the target.  it's not actualy open yet.  but there's a fair tomorrow where there going to do most of their hiring, me and mom are both going.  anyway, she wanted to look because she would want to work in garden, but since it rains like 9 months a year up here if garden was outside she didn't want to be there.  we didn't see one so we're good to go!!  yea, and for some reason the hiring thing is going to be at the holiday inn down the street, not in front of target, which makes no sense to me but whatever.  we're going early.

so that's my day so far, nothing special.  but that took hours.  that's the problem with living in a semi rural area.  everything is so far.  

haha, i still think it's halarious that safeway is over the hill and my ears pop going to safeway *giggles*

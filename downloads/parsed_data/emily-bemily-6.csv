It was so much fun we totally have to do it again!!!! IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!!!!!

"event","today school was really hot... I was so out of it i didn't want to be there in that building. super gym was awesome we killed the 6th graders they cheat a lot! 4 a few days now i feel as if the friends i had in New York aren't my friends anymore that the only friends i really have are the ones in Maine. Kennebunk feels more like my home then any other place i've ever lived. i love it up her and i love the people up here a lot they let me be myself. 

it's thundering now... thunder is strange scary to some but wonderful to others. i like thunder the calmness before the sky breaks... the crack of lightning across the sky i love it the low roll of thunder that gets lowder...

i'm so bored and i don't even know why i just wrote about thunder but watever. 

Leave me a comment 4 some excitement!"

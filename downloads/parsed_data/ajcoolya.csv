"event","I think there is a certain point in our lives when we stop and think about everything... like sit down and really think about the way we act and the way we carry ourselves, the way we come across to other people and the way other people see us... i havent written for ages, and i have so much to say and feel like i have so little  time to say it... i've been bottled up for weeks now and its time to crack...

I recently let go of one of the most self defining things i had in my life, a relationship with a boy... for weeks prior to this the emotional rollercoaster i was on was one big fuck up... it went from wanting him every second of the day to questioning myself as to why i was even up here... time like when your sitting there and you know you have an opinion and your right and someone is stubborn enough not to accept it then  you start to wonder... I think my problem is i wonder too much, I analyse every situation and in some hope want to find an answer....

when you break off something for good and all is said and done your supposed to pick yourself up and carry on right... well i cant... im stuck.... right here, in my bed, alone, afraid, scared, hurt, sad, crying, feeling empty and wanting to have some meaning to my existance once again... power trips of self control and proved to be not a positive thing to benefit from, and i speak from experience... when you think your doing something that is right for you and your thinking about your future and what you want to do, then you should be happy about it right? I was... i was excited to finaly go back to my old uni degree and major in marketing and be all little mr. career orientated for a change and look after me! do what I want to do,... i've reached a point where im sick of being there for everyone else whether i want to or not... im sick of caring what other ppl think,... i mean right now im wondering if anyone will actually read this shit! 

so there i was thinking right i know what i want to do and im going to do it... and no-one can stop me... except for you... when you think u have the support of someone you love and then it all backfired in your face u start to wonder if they were concerned about you and your future @ all...I mean if they have rejected the offer/proposal of what you want to do with your future in your past isnt it time to start thinking about things... 

having a constant war with myself everyday doesnt help either but we'll save that for another time...

after deciding to finish off my old degree, I thought i would be happy, going back to see friends and living @ home with not responsibilities or anything, but u wont be there... u wont be there to see, hear or smell or just feel around me... you wont be there sneak a look @ when your sitting @ your computer hunched over and listening away to the latest band you've fallen inlove with... I still am trying to justify my actions inside...

so many ppl have told me so many different things and i dont know whether to listen to them or myself... of course i should listen to myself but if i dont know who i am then how can i expect and accept and outcome? just hearing you move on the squeaky lounge provides the trails of comfort i need...

i thought i believed in the whole - if its meant to be then it will happen, ie. getting back together in the future... but im not to sure if i do anymore... it leads to me thinking that once i have finished uni and done my time in sydney that everything will be fine... and wont go back to the way they were, but will start over and fresh and everything wil be great... for once...

im scared of being alone.... not sure why, just am afraid i will end up like the seedy old men in clubs who no-one wants to know and everyone feels sorry for and pittys and thinks YUK.... another reason why i hate the idea of me being gay...

how is it that all my life i've wanted a relationship with someone who think the world of me... someone who loves everything about me.... even the things i dont...who will do anything for me and says im beatiful... someone who makes myheart beat just that little bit faster when he walks into the room... someone who's smile makes me smile... who's laugh makes me laugh, who's face i want to press against mine for as long as i can.... who just came into my room dressed in jeans and a buttoned up yellow shirt asking my for the mail key... who leaves a tear running down my face right now... someone who u thought u could never live without and then you are... someone who you vowed to yourself never to cheat on and you did... someone who makes u so worked up inside that you fall into old habbits that need to be broken... someone whos mere existance makes things ok, someone that you know you will never forget...
someone who's body you crave,who's kisses you cherish... whos name means love and thats all you ever wanted to do... and now that you;ve stuffed up that then what is there to really look forward too???

in the process of bottling things up and not talking to anyone i've pushed my best friend away, as her an him became closer... fear of being replaced and to some extent being so... its not her fault its mine and im sorry... i saw them together laughing and happy and it made me think well what am i here for then.. 

its as if bc i know what i want to do career wise now everything else fucks up and bc of that everyone else doesnt give a fuck... but me... i do... i care where i am in 10 yrs time... i want a good future and im sick of ppl being selfish and not allowing me to do it... im sick of giving everything my all to start with and having it thrown in my face and blown up... im sick of living for yesterday and dwelling on the past and feelings and hope... i just want to live for now, day by day... week by week... and maybe month by month... but nomore...

i thought u used alcohol as a way to numb things... maybe i was wrong, and thats how i wanted u to deal with things... maybe i was the one that needed to do that... maybe im the one that needs to drink and drink and drink until he cant feel anything anymore and end it bc he knows he wont ever find love like yours again... i say this with such passion and anger but i know that we both brought on the end ourselves...

it seems everywhere i go and everything i do reminds me of you in some way shape or form... there isnt anything that i cant not relate to you somehow... and it poisons me and drags up the past... 

there is so much more to say but i feel so exhausted right now... emtionally and physically and your online and talking to me... were talking for the first time in ages... my stubborn self has come to realise that your not worth loosing... not one bit, not even a little... not at all... so i leave you with these words from brooke frasers 'arithmetic'... which makes me thinkg of u with every line... makes my cry... makes me have hope that someday when i sort out myself we will be happy together...

I've been staring at the sky tonight 
Marvelling and passing time 
Wondering what to do with daylight 
Until I can make you mine 
You are the one I want, you are the one I want 

I've been thinking of changing my mind 
(It never stays the same for long) 
But of all the things I know for sure 
You're the only certain one 
You are the one I want, you are the one I want 

I've been counting up all my wrongs 
One sorry for each star 
See I'd apologise my way to you 
If the heavens stretched that far 
You are the one I want, you are the one I want 

I won't find what I am looking for 
If I only ""see"" by keeping score 
'Cos I know now you are so much more than arithmetic 

'Cos if I add, if I subtract 
If I give it all, try to take some back 
I've forgotten the freedom that comes from the fact 
That you are the sum 
So you are the one 
I want 

When the years are showing on my face 
And my strongest days are gone 
When my heart and flesh depart this place 
From a life that sung your song 

You'll still be the one I want 
You'll still be the one I want 
You'll still be the one I want 
You'll still be the one I want


im sorry i didnt make our year..."

"event","""The Special Two""

I've hardly been outside my room in days, 
'cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays. 
The darkness helps until the whiskey wears away, 
And it's then I realize the conscience never fades. 
When you're young you have this image of your life: 
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife. 
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross, 
And if you happen to you wake completely lost. 
But I will fight for you, be sure that 
I will fight until we're the special two once again. 

And we will only need each other, we'll breathe together, 
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's, 
When we were the special two. 
And we could only see each other, we'd breathe together, 
These arms will not be taught to need another, 
'Cause we were the special two. 

I remember someone old once said to me: 
""Lies will lock you up with truth the only key."" 
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell, 
And couldn't see this place would soon become my hell. 
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face? 
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place. 
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now, 
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not 
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again. 

And we will only need each other, we'll breathe together, 
Our hands will not be taught to need another's, 
When we're the special two. 
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together, 
These arms will not be taught to need another... 

I step outside my mind's eye's for a minute. 
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease, 
Or something that could ease the pain. 
But nothing cures the hurt you bring onto yourself, 
Just remembering, just remembering who we were...



That song has so many things in it that relate its nor funny...

like the image of your life part - i never thought i'd be here... fighting for a boy i love... 
and boundaries you thought you'd never cross... covers alot of stuff but mainly falling inlove with a boy...

and the special two... thats all that needs to be said... 


""couldnt see this place become my hell"" and ""lies will lock you up with truth the only key..."" for those of you who know... you'll know what im talking about...

""nothing cures the hurt you bring onto yourself..."" you've been your own worst enemy thru this and i want to change that... i want you to see the beautiful soul who i love... and i want to rid you of all the baggage... the hurt and the pain... the crap and the things that make you weak... i want you all to myself... 


i need you... i want you... we need each other... i just dont want to have to worry or be hurt or worry about being hurt again...

"event","im anxious to see what jaime has to say tomorrow... what he has to offer me... what he wants and what he needs... and what he thinks and feels...

i know he wont be completely mine... for a longtime... if ever... sometimes i think were too immature between the both of us to be in this... 

*pauses as tears roll down my face... excuse me*

im waiting for him to blurt out all the things that he's done since i've been with him... who should i say who... why does it make me so jealous if i've turned around and done the same sort of thing? it doesnt make sense.... im my mind he is everything... i just dont want to be hurt... i want the hurt to stop... i want to be happy and carefree and trusting and loving and patient and caring and there for him... but only if he'll let me... maybe he wants an open relationship where he can be with other ppl but im still there...? is that bad? my ongoing dislike for jarred and marc are subsiding... which is an indication to me that im moving on... slightly and to a certain extent... 

i just want us to live together and be happy... not just in general... but with each other... and to be honest and understanding... and respectful towards one anothers feelings as a result of actions carried out...

i just want to be loved right and treated good and not lied to or fucked around or screwed over... i want to be able to trust and love again... to be free from worry... to have my mind set @ ease... is this too much to ask?

there is a song by missy higgins that reflects some stuff right now that i'll post in a sec...

tomorrow i wont be angry, i wont be sad, i wont be hurt, i wont be taken for a fool... i'll be strong and walk away if i need to... if i have no choice... im preparing myself for the worst... anther relationship... another spark... another encounter... another person.... another example of me jumping to conclusions and not listening 1st..."

is it wrong to want to love someone because your addicted to them... like you need them to breathe?
is it wrong to not know what i want?
is it wrong to be jealous?
is it wrong to want to be somewhere else right now... and not here in this hell i have created for myself?
is it wrong to be my own worst enemy... i just want to be loved... and love... and have everything back to how it was before the truth of it all came out... i need, i crave, i want, i can't...

maybe its a sign for us to move on and away... be friends... or not... maybe its a sign saying that he was kidding himself... that i was kidding myself... that we were both kidding ourselves in thinking that one day and forever we could live happily ever after... im not all you want otherwise none of this would have happend.... there has got to be a reason... there has to be... maybe were better off alone and stop lying to ourselves... its clear... or is it?

"event","where do i start....


it wa sover a month ago that my world came crashing down... the one i loved kissed ""friends"" and it was all over... i have never felt so used and disgusting and hurt in all my life...  we tried to make it work after i let go... and now i've fucked up even more... even more than before... possibly the worst i ever will in my whole life...
i took him back and it felt weird... to start with... maybe we rushed back into things too quickly... maybe i was just being stupid...

sometimes i feel like i make myself be unhappy... that i push away the good and fuck up everything bc i dont feel i deserve to be in the state of mind of complete happines... maybe i can never be happy... 

i cant go on like this... i've told him that i dont think i love him the way he loves me... i've pushed him over the edge and now he's gone... fallen down and out of my life... for good... i wish i would get a rope and save him but i cant ... i've said what i've said and i think about it everyday... it hurts to breathe knowing that he wont be there... it hurts to think about him, it makes me cry when i think about him with someone else other than me... i  cry and the tears roll down my face... they sting... sting like hot water... why do i feel this way?

is it because i love him more than i will ever know... do i love him more that i know... am i scared to love him and to be commited to the one person... i dont know why that is so hard... because its all i've ever wanted... i keep asking ppl what should i do but all i can do is answer it for myself... but i even if i did change my mind he wouldn't be there... his heart would be gone ... his soul lost from me forever... its harder to breathe....

my head spins and im in my own world... a world of heartache... i world of regret and what ifs... i can't even begin to think about life after him... how long does it take for the hurt to stop? everyone tels me i'll be fine but i know i'll only be fine if i get the one thing that will make me happy... but why do i push him away... i keep pushing him more... i keep fucking up.... i want to cry and let it all out...


he's going to meet someone tomorrow night... its all over... he's moving on... and even tho i know i should i can't... why do i care? because i love him... whether my head thinks it right or not... its the truth... my heart says i love jaime... and thats it...


sure i dont like paul much bc he is a free spirited young man who isn't afraid of what people think of him and lives life to the fullest.... and im a stupid normal rule abiding shit that lives my boundaries and i hate myself... i hate me because i have driven and pushed him away... i hate  it... why do i do everything wrong... why cant i be normal... why cant i be happy... why cant something i not fuck things up and love something beautiful... why is it so hard...


i love you whethere i like it or not... i love you whether you like it or not... i love you whether you will let me or not... i love you whether i ever get to love you again or not... im scared and paranoid and fucked... geez swear words are over used...

Love makes you go crazy on every way... loving you drives me crazy... its all i think about... and now i have gone and fucked it up...

your all i have thought about for 7 months... day in day out... in my dreams... in my exams, in my work, in my family life...

i dont know what to do anymore... or say... just a hug and a cry is all i want and i feel so alone now... you hate me and there is no going back... please forgive me someday for making you like this..."

4) i drink lots and lots and kiss boy again
5) say stop bc i think i still have a boyfriend, but really, who the fuck would know because you fucking didnt asshole!!! fuck me, who doesnt remember they break up with their boyfriend!?? thats right, YOU because you always seem to be drunk or trashed or pissed off or annoyed...
6) me feel sick and go home
7) msg u and call you for several days after to try and sort out what the fuck happend!
8) come home and abuse me 
9) now your acting like a cunt! you said it not me!

the sight of me makes him sick, and he feels like dying... im the bad guy here and i cant do anything about it - i've fucked up... i've fucked up the one thing i thought i knew... he is so cut by my actions and i don't blame him... but somehow its not the same as the time he made out with 4 friends... i think its similar, but its obviously not... part of me just wants to brush it off and go, yeah it was, but other parts of me are going, no, its worse... i dont know what to think anymore...

i still have his rufus tickets here... part of his christmas present... 

its funny bc so many couples i know are having problems right now... it seems that after christmans and before new years is the most major break up season - well then and in mid may...

i know i've never been in love like this before... but does it always hurt so much? maybe only when im involved bc i know so many other ppl that seem to be fine... then again on the surface so do i.

maybe its easier for straight couples... maybe its gods punishment of to us freaks... well some would call us that....

i think its safe to say i have issues... and i dont think jaime wants to deal with them... or have anything to do with me anymore..."

"event","well after a shitty nights sleep.... i've become numb to any feelings... i dont know why... but all i want to do is cry but i can't... im angry and i want to be but i can't... im emotionless and everything is just a blurr...
i think its apart of growing older... you don't get excited the same way about things... you dont think about things the same and there is less emotions all around involved in everything... well in things that used to make me emotional when i was younger .... mind u, half the things im doing now i wouldnt have been doing 10 years ago...

its funny you know, bc half the time i step bakc in my mind and go - wait... this isn't right, im not in this situation... or, this person can;t really like me, im nothing like them and so below them its not funny... i always tend to look at it as if other are judging me and that they are only being nice on the surface... dont know why, its just another way that my stupid twisted mind works.... i sometimes feel like i don't belong... that im not supposed to be here... like in situations... not life, life itself is precious, yet im fucking every aspect of it up right now!

i had alot to say but now i can't rememeber one bit of it...  i'll take a break and come back...


i know there is nothing better than this or is there?> im probably not making any sense right now... but i don't care

looking at my arm right now, it looks like art... but stings at the same time... im just weird i know... ergh - aren't we all!

have you ever wanted something so badly and then once you have it your so happy, and then things start to change and then you dont know if you want it anymore... then there is all the what if questions and then after things happen, you regret even thinking about it and want to take it back... and its at that point you realise that it's not what you want at all and that you were happier with your 1st want...

i've been there, done that... and trust me its not worth testing the other side of the fence... it fucks things up big time!
 i love you to nicole, and im sorry you feel that way - you are one of the good things in my life! we've become so close over the last year and then some over these past few months... who knows, i might be back home and @ uni with you agaain if things dont work out up here..."

"event","well this is the first time that i'v posted... and there is so much to say


firstly i wanna walk about pop dying... he had bene in hospital the week before because his calcium levels were too high from chemotherapy and he was just on a drip etc. then on boxing day dad got a call form my nan saying that he had gone into a coma.... my first instincts was that he isn't going to make it... that he is dead and thats that... i saw my dad cry... weeping like a baby for the first time in my life... it scared me but also comforted me to know that he is capable of showing emotions. i sat there frozen for a secind while dad and mum packed the car and drove home back to lismore, leaving me to pack up everything and say goodbye to mums family... we go to brisbane every 2nd year for christams with my mums side of the family. with pop in hospital i really dont know why we didnt just stay in lismore with him... i remember seeing him the week before... he was so weak and frail but he was still able to pump out the humour...  something he will be famously remembers by... i remember thinking how thin he looks and all i wants to do was cry because this was the 1st time i has seen him since he had been diagnosed... mum kept looking @ me and i kept looking away coz i nearly cried...

anyway on the drive back home all i wanted was to be with my boyfriend jaime and for him to tell me it was all going to be ok... i wanted  him to meet me back @ my place, but being the boy he is, he goes ohh ok.... then msgs me later and asks if i wanted to come over... b4 i lef. i wish he had have made the effort to meet me @ my house.,.. but thats little crap... i started singing some old christian  songs that i used to sing @ church .... back in the times when things were a little simpler and life wasn't dominated by sexuality.... but thats the next part of discussion... they made me cry... because as i drove down the highway i knew that he was gone...his body gone forever... 
i got to lismore @ 11:30 and then went straight to bed bc i was so bloody tired... i fell asleep with the thought of jaime hugging me and how much i wanted him here... to hold and to say everything will be ok...

there is this photo of him on his livejournal where he has his lips near a friend cheek and i think about that photo all the time bc it sums him up - one big ball of love and laughs... soft and kind natured... handsome and cheeky...

i woke up the next morning with dad in tears hugging me saying that his dad had passes away that morning... i cried bc i didnt get to say goodbye while he could hear me... i cried  bc i knew that this was the start of the downhill slide... where everyone dies and its only a matter of time... i cried bc i was thinking of my nan and how sad she would be and how much of her life is just gone... i often wonder whether nan will never wash the sheets again to savour pops smell - like its her breathe of life... and what keeps her going... it makes me sad...  i wonder if they held each other the night pop found out he had lung cancer and cried themselves to sleep...

i didn't cry that much that day... i went to see nan and gave her flowers and all my auntys and uncles were there... she loved the flowers and all i wanted to was hug her and take away all her hurt and pain and sadness... 

the funeral - 3 days later was bad

i woke up in a state of i dunno, silence and peace... then i got to the church and saw the hertz and just cried... as ppl passed me i hid under my sunnies and wept... i cried bc i knew it was the last time i would say 'goodbye pop'... 

i walked into the church and just looked at the coffin... crying, i sat down and stared... i sat there, not moving my lips or mouth, or making a sound... all i did was cry... i was half expecting pop to jump out and say ""hi everybody""... or for someone to start tapping from the inside of the  coffin... it was a light wood grain with gold trims and a huge bunch of purple, yellow and blue flowers....it was so beautiful... i just sat there and remembered all the times i spent with him... and all the hymns and bible readings made me believe that he was on his way to heaven...and it got me thinking.... all this religious stuff is a comforter and even tho i'd like to think that i'm a christian, other believe when they want to

the time came when i had to listen to my dad read his rememberance speech, in which he started off crying and ended by crying... then it came tim to carry the coffin... i had to breathe and focus on the task, i got up and stood tall, and walked out of that church with nothin in sight but the door - i had ppl touching my arm as i wept and didnt wipe away the tears... i brushed them off bc nothing they would do would make me feel any better @ all... or anything. the worst part was seeing everyone after we put him in the hertz... i cried more


then cried more and more and more when we lowered him into the grave - it seemed so final and wrong and heartbreaking... i couldnt even see properly that afternoon, i had cried myself to sleep several times that day/...

when i was sitting in the church one person came to mind... one person i wanted next to me, to hold my hand and hug me and comfort me... to take it all away... the one i wanted to reach out for and never let go... that was jaime...


thats enough on the funeral and pop part, i feel like crying now... i am crying now...


new years was a shit! i did everything wrong imaginable...

i dont even need to start saying anything on that note bc i drank way too much and kissed another boy...

i dont remember much, but i remember feeling crap after kissing him and drinking alot more... if only i had have stayied in lismore, none of this would have happend...


jaime is another thing that i want to talk about...
we've been through so much and its hard to believe its coming to an end... well i think it is...  im being distracted by the tv so i think i'll stop right now...


tv is off!

life right now is one big confused mess...

i dont know if i want to be gay, yet being straight would be so much the easier way out of things... the outing to parents... the public displays of affection, society, friends, work.... everything! altho this hasnt stopped me yet - i;ve been hiding my tru feelings for one special person for a while now...\
religion is  a huge deal, bc i was brought up a christian and went to chruch and youth group and sunday school ect ect. and prayed everyday... and now i've discovered this whole new world that is supposed to be evil... yet feels ok... its a fuck up on my mind and spirit.... i know god is real and i believe in him... but how i live my life the way i am and have him still love me and me go to heaven... when what im doing is apparently wrong...
its a condradiction!
by saying im Bisexual, i leave  my options open to go straight or gay... when really im just scared to admit to myself that i am who i am... not that i know what that is right now.... but i do know what some loves me, well did love me very much... untill i fucked up things...
sexuality is such a fucked up piece of shit! i've wrestled and struggled with it for ages and ages and i just want it to all end.... i want an answer - i want someone to tell me what to do - clearly it wont happen...
sexuality is so over rated  -  i mean i look @  queeny guys and they dont appeal to me and if i ever became one i would shoot myself in the head! and then the straight marcho assholes piss me off bc they treat women as objects... but thats going form one extreme to the next on the sexuality scale. i know that right now i am happy, and want to live for now and for the moment and who knows what might happen! being gay may be just a common as being str8 and the world will live happily !
most of all this is a reflection on how my parents expect me to grow up - to comform to how ythey want me to live would be stupid... but i dont know any better... but then again, i do know im in love with one of the worlds most wonderfulest guys... he makes my heart beat one pace faster every time... he makes me smile and lights up the room he walks in... with his cheeky smile and funny humour... god... what have i done....

on sunday @ work, after new years,  i was in a depressed mood - actually i think i still am in one as i type... i havent done this for ages, not since my last boyfriend moved away and everything got to hard and everyone around me wouldn't listen.... i havent done this for about 8 months... im talking about cutting myself... ot make thing better... to make me feel... to make me better... thats why my friends said that i was so happy when i met jaime  =  they could see a dramatic change in my mood and outlook on life and they said "" its good to see your happy"" ""havent seen you this happy in a long time""
i used a box cutter from work... it was just big enough to make me bleed but nit do any major damage - i can still see the scars faintly when i sweat...

but last sunday, as i was breaking up picture frames a sharp piece of glass cut me, and it felt good to feel something again... well since new years... so i stole 2 pieces and was out in the bacf office cutting my wrist... not hard, but softly...more scratches rather... but then had to stop bc one of the girls form work came in and i got called to the registers... maybe if i had have kept going things would be different now... im in  the mood to do it again right now... @least this way i can fell something of what jaime does right now... 

i new it was a mistake - to even think about kissing him... he was there and i was drunk... i'd already said no to another slease b4 that, and then no to him initally....  but i dont know if it was the moment or the alcohol or the large amounts of passion popi had drunk 5 mins b4 that had gone to my head like a drug.... but i kissed him - it was gross actually - cigarettes and booze... nothing like the taste of jaime - infact the opposite... maybe thats why i did it - to see what was on the other side...  and now i  know that its not the otherside that i want... that side is plastic and fake and queen ridden.... sorry - i dont like drags much... or queens...

that is a defining moment for me... the moment where people go  -  wow, he is a cheating slut! with just one kiss, everything that was me, my self respect, dignity and worth was gone... i was now no longer me... and i felt sick... sick with guilt and alcohol... i sent him an sms saying i had kissed someone else... then he dumped me... 3 text messages consisting of "" i dont want to go out with you anymore, fuck you its over i never want to see you again, and i hope you get this in the morning bc we are over"" ... and thats when i wanted to die... everything i had known for the past 7 months had gone... im still lost... in a drunken state we  both redefined out relationship and said and did things we shouldn't  have... so was i technically single then? i dont know.... was he off with someone else?> i dont know... i don't know!!! i don't remember much after that - bc i just kept drinking and drinking and forgot about everything - i remember kell and krystal sitting me down on a bench outside MPs and told me to sit up... 

there will always be doubt in my mind whether i like it or not, who im with, or what ever they say they are doing... as to what they are really doing... are they off with a secret lover, or kissing another, of flirting... or having sex with someone else... i dont have camera's placed on all of you watching you every second of the day! even though i wish i could, i can't... and it's time for me to start letting human instincts take charge and leave you to do what you do when your away from me...
trust is always an issue with me for some reason... its fucked up... like me...

my head hurts from thinking right now and it's in these moments when i think of him ... and wonder how i can hurt you... hurt you so bad ... hurting jaime seems to be all that im capable of... and right now i cant do anything to take it away... im the bad guy here and i want to hurt myself over and over...til there is nothing left... i want to scream out and punch love in the face and everything i know... how can i long for something for so long and with so much will and then get it and fuck it all  up... everytime! its what i want so badly and then i wreck it all...  i love you too much... even if i dont like to admit it... you are my rock... and apart of me and my life... and everything i do... im the bad guy - so shoot me - i;ve fucked up and there is nothing that i can do about it... i make you sick @ the sight of me and i can see you now ripping down the photos of me on your wall... deleting me from your life... i think its that time again... to take the pain i've caused you, into my own feelings... i love you"

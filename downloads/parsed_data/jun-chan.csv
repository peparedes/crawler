And for those still wondering about my last entry... its way out of date now.  Someday I shall post about what happened, but not for now. I've too many things to do to get ready for halloween.

"event","Yep, another one of those dream entries.  But I hope this one proves to be entertaining to you all.

Starts out and I'm walking to my car in a parking garage.  This guy starts to approach me and my first thought of course is ""oh crap I'm gonna get robbed or something.""  Of course it's my dream world and I'm always right.  So I unlock my car but the key fob unlocks all the doors on accident instead of just the drivers door, so he opens the passenger door and starts rifling through my shit.  I'm pissed and start yelling and run around the car to chase him... he manages to evade me, comes around to the driver's side and steals a bunch of my cds and stuff... there's about three rounds of this and I'm getting really frustrated because every time I actually manage to save something he steals yet something else.

Well, I finally do catch him as he's running off satisfied with himself, and what do I do?  I knock him to the ground and stomp on his head til he's ""unconscious.""  I don't check to make sure of anything here, I just assume ""unconscious"" with a great deal of satisfaction if you get my drift. 

Naturally, while I'm beating guy number 1, his partner sneaks in and finishes the job of robbing my car.  Now I'm really pissed.  I see him sneaking off, and after LOCKING MY CAR I sneak off behind him. I lose him for a little bit, but catch up at his house which is right next to the garage. (Ie: he went somewhere to stash the loot, because he hasn't got it when he gets there.)  His wife and little daughter come out to greet him and this dachsund that's with him, and here I'm crossing the yard from the other direction.  Here's where it gets interesting, I start acting like a bad guy, but I really don't care.  I say to his daughter ""Your daddy is a dirty theif!"" right in front of both her parents.  And you know what?  They don't say a damned thing! That felt really good, so I did it a few more times to make sure it sank in.  The wife actually seems bothered that her husband has been stealing, and tries to help me figure out what's going on while he just stands around quietly and kind of smug.  It gets a little fuzzy here, but the next part gets even more interesting.

So I'm storming about their shack and I see the little dachsund that had come back with him.  The little dog is kinda pitiful and is obviously a bt nervous of attention.  In dream-terms I know that he's neglected and starved for affection by theif dude, but that he's grateful for what little he gets.  So I pull a Cesar Millan/Dog Whisperer and in 10 minutes the dog is totally obedient to me and in love with me and I'm all dominant and shit.  It was cool. So then I ask the dog to take me to the loot and he does and it's in another run-down house a little ways away.  I wander around the place before finding my shit on the top of a stack of shit sitting on the fireplace.  So I grab it and the wife shows up and it gets fuzzy again and then I follow the dog to this yard which is apparently where he actually lives and his owner abandoned him in this yard which was when theif dude kinda took him in and what not.  The end. (Hey, I know its not a very satisfying ending, but I woke up to go pee!)

So I beat a guy (possibly to death), foiled a crime, and saved a little dog.  Quite a night!"

Just a quick note, because I want to talk about this a little.  It made me really sad today.  I suppose that most of the time I'm a pretty selfish person, if only accidentally because I just don't think about it.  But today I had to make one of those hard decisions.  I had to decide whether life was worth living for a dear pet of mine: my hairless rat, Godiva.

She had a tumor on her belly that had grown and swollen her entire abdomen region, and also consisted of a large open abscess on her belly.  The abscess was constantly oozing and smelled bad.  She'd also just lost an eye.  The eye had been infected for a long time, and though we never determined an absolute cause for it, it was probably because of some bedding fuzz getting caught under the lid and injuring it.  Seeing this, and how she had slowed down so much... I had to wonder how much pain she must be in just trying to live.  So I decided that it would be best for her to die.  I didn't feel bad about this, so much as sad.  I didn't feel guilt, so much as pity.  I loved her enough to kill her.  I had to ask my Dad to do it though, because I wasn't sure I had the physical strength to do it in one strike, and I didn't want her to suffer.  I had thought that breaking her neck would be the way to go... but he said that it was actually pretty difficult to do.  It was sweet that he was so worried about me, and I was definitely crying about it... but I just knew I was going to miss her.  I'm not disturbed by death or even by gore... and I suppose that's rather callous of me in some regards... but to me her life was more important than her death and my memory of it will last me longer than whatever happened today.

So, after some discussion, he suggested using a hammer.

I had her wrapped in a towel to restrain her a little, though she didn't much need it.  She used to squirm so much whenever she was held, prefering to climb and explore your shoulders and arms... but today she only wiggled a little and poked her head around meekly.  The tears streamed uncontrollably down my face, and I didn't try to stop them... I just blew my nose and held Godiva close to me.  

I took her outside where my Dad was preparing a spot to do it.  

He picked a disposable white rag to replace the towel I had her in and after covering her he placed her on a board that he had put down on the concrete of our driveway.  I stood beside it, just inside the garage.  He made sure of where her head was, and held her fragile body to the board.  The hammer came down.  Twice.  She made no noise.

Her body went into some nervous twitching and he told me to look away.  I did, though it was unnessesary, while he looked under the rag to make sure it was over.  Her legs were still kicking when he handed the bloody bundle to me to put into the plastic bag in my hands.  I held her while the twitching stopped and she finally went limp.  My parents helped me bury her in the backyard.

It's always so hard to lose a pet.  I still remember the Betta fish I kept when I was at TCU.  I remember a beautiful yellow one named Honey, that had died so suddenly.  I remember most all of them, and there were several.  Over the years, this has been the first pet for whom I was there at the moment of death... and I think I truly prefer it this way.  Some died naturally and there have been others we've taken to the vet to end it... but this was the first for whom I watched over the action of ending their life.  Honestly, I should have liked to have been the one holding her in that final moment.  I'm crying, even as I write this... because I will miss her.  

I don't really know what else to say about it.  I told two friends about it today, and looking back on it, I suppose I seemed a little callous about it when I told them.  I just told them about it very matter-of-factly.  I don't know why it came out that way either.  Well... at any rate... I don't know what else to say about this.  As I said at the start, it's not something that's so horrible in my life.  In fact there's really a sense of relief involved as well... I'm just sad about it, as I should be.  I felt a need to describe the moment, and so here it is... take it for what you wish.

And for those who read this and were looking forward to a post by me at some point, sorry this was such a strange and sad one.  I'll try to find some kind of happy event to cover in detail for the next one.  I love you all, very much."

Ok, so I haven't seen Walk the Line yet, but my parents went to see it tonight while I was on a date, and now that particular Johnny Cash song is stuck in my head and I really want to see the movie! And when I say that Johhny Cash song, I mean the chorus to that song... exactly as written there.  I don't usually like country music, but that is one DAMN GOOD SONG!  I just wish I could listen to the rest to either know more of it or get it out of my head because that one little bit has been circling around in there so much I even have a little dance number to go with it!

"event","Well, I've been out of school all semester,and not doing the things I swore up and down that I was going to be doing, like sewing for my dollies.  Bad me.  But, the coming semester sounds like it will be alright.  I'm not taking it full time, but my classes will last me TR 9:30 to 4:20 on one of those days (BIOL lab... really makes it hard to plan a good sched.)  But only driving to Denton 2 days a week will save me a bunch on gas.  I'm still driving old Harmony the Accord, though she's looking a bit battered these days (honestly, I need a Honda with a higher front end that still hugs the road... good luck, right?).  So apart from being absolutely lazy, there hasn't been much going on except the usual frustrations.

And I wanted to go to LA so badly, but there's an odd paradox to this.  Namely, I can't go because A: I was dumb and didn't do most of my ""paperwork"" on time for all the cool stuff, and B: I don't have a job and thusly I can't afford it. (Did I mention I quit working at the Velvet Hooker?  Had I ever mentioned I was working there before?  Maybe I'll go into that little adventure at a later date) So ANYWAY, the paradox here is that if I had a job where I could afford to go to LA for the weekend, I probably would not be able to take the time off since I probably would not have been working there long enough to have earned any vacation time.  Even though its on the weekend, nice office jobs in this area are pretty tough to find it seems.  And I DEFINITELY don't want to work in customer service anymore.  I hate customers, I hate people, and while I don't mind grovelling for someone professionally, customers suck.  Customers are all about their entitlement and I'm sorry, but you aren't entitled to fucking shit.  I only wished that while I was working in customer service that I'd practiced spitting. But, on that note it also sensitized me to how to treat wait-staff and customer service people.  I'm pretty polite to begin with, but now I usually tip better than 15% unless you were just downright the crappiest person I've ever met.

So yeah... I've been too lazy this semester to have really talked about anything of worth, and only enough to bitch about once in a blue moon, not to mention I've been spending ALL my freaking time on www.denofangels.com/forums/index.php.  Yeah, I'm a dork, but hell... between my dolls and my ferrets I've got warm fuzzies and a perfect ""boyfriend"".  So I'm going to stop here for those of you who have suffered through this horrible mess, before I alienate you further by drolling on about weird shit.  Maybe my next post will contain all that weird shit.  And a final visualization to all of you: On the Hello Kitty Vibrator, the face is the most erm... stimulating part."

For those who don't know what exactly I mean by this, I dare say that further explanations will be following, but suffice it to say that I'm not the only voice who will be posting on that journal and it will probably involve many pictures as well.  Friend it if you like, but keep in mind I also plan to start updating this journal as well, so this will be MY journal, and the other will be for my hobby-related posts.  Fun Stuff!

Oh, and like the title says, I don't plan to be so whiney on here anymore.  I'm sure it will be a bit boring like that, but I really don't need the whole world to read about how horrid I think my life is at times and believe that I feel that way all the time.  As nice as a verbal outlet can be, I think this journal would better suit me at being able to update people on the events of my life rather than the bad thoughts that occasionally scurry through my pretty little head."

"event","Don't pay too much attention to that last post... It was just me trying to get out some feelings that were bothering me.  Its kind of like... I don't want to feel this way anymore, so I'll spill it on LJ and hope that gets it out of the way.  I didn't mean for anyone to read that and get mad at me. ^^;;;  I mentioned that I realized it's mostly my own fault for not contacting anyone myself.

Anyways, it was really nice of everyone to respond to that like you did... it made me feel a lot better knowing that everyone read that and wanted me to feel better... and on that matter I do now, though since I wrote that I was a bit devastated by something happening at home... its a longish story, so here goes:

I was out yesterday afternoon with Jeff (my brother), he needed shoes and I was navigator and we got dinner afterwords.  We were in his truck and he'd noticed it had been overheating a bit.  So, when we got home he checked under the hood.  Now, I'd already gone inside to let the ferrets out when he came in asking me to come out and help him with something.  I went to the garage to find water ALL over the driveway and he explained to me that the radiator cap had popped off (he'd been burned slightly by the boiling water spewing out just as he reached for the cap with a towel to tighten it).  So we tried looking for the cap on the ground but couldn't find it, so I offered to drive him to work and pick him up this morning. (He works a 7pm-7am shift.) Well, we were in a bit of a hurry cause it was already 6 and his job is out in Irving and we didn't want him to be late, so I grabbed my keys and purse and took him to work, to return home some 45 minutes or more later.  See any problem here? (I mean besides Jeff going to work with burns on his shoulder and neck and me having to get up and leave the house by 6:30 am this morning).  Yes, the ferrets were still loose running unsupervised havoc.  Goober had pulled his usual stunt of knocking the Gerbil cage off the desk, spilling the two gerbils on the floor and setting them loose.  Mira, the one who'd lived in the wild for who knows how long before being rescued and my purchasing her, is probably the one who did it, but I came home to find two little bloody bodies on the floor.  I buried the Gerbils in the backyard near where Curly Sue is buried.

So, as I said, I'm a bit broken up about it... Its a bit nerve-racking finding one dead body in your room, and not knowing if the other one escaped to safty or the cat's belly and having to search the whole house only to find the other body under your dresser and much stiffer than the first.  *Sigh*  I won't be replacing them.  Its probably for the best, but I can't help feeling a bit sad about it.  I just hope that...well... that they're ok now.  I know that seems like a silly thing to say, but... Yeah.  

I'm gonna jet now, and I again apologize for any feelings hurt by the last post.  I really was just tired of feeling those things when in my mind I had no excuse for my own lacsidaisical approach to correspondence, so I wanted to get them out.  I guess I could have put it on private, but I decided a long time ago that I wouldn't do that, and anything I put on here I feel people should feel free to read.  It lets people see a side of me I normally wouldn't talk about in person... the thoughts I'd never be able to say face to face.  I just want to be honest with the world, though perhaps discretion really IS the better part of valour. ^^

Until next time, I love you all and miss you terribly and I refuse to make any promises about changing my ways, cause you're supposed to love me the way I am. ^^"

I get so lonely all by myself around here, and no one notices because NO ONE BOTHERS TO GET IN TOUCH!!  I'm tired of being the one who has to contact everyone else if I want to talk to them.  I have YET to get an e-mail or anything from Becca, and the last time I called she didn't have time to talk because she and Kat had something to do.... Rachel only calls or e-mails if there's something for the movie... Abbey... well... technically I've given up on Abbey completely, but when you have nothing to do but mope angrily around the house you tend to dwell on that sort of thing.  It would be nice if there were something besides junk mail when I occasionally check my inbox... I mean, even if its just a little bitty e-mail to say hi, or such and such happened to me... I mean, I may not get online to chat very often, but I still want to know that at least one person out there thinks about me as often as I think about them... but I guess any thoughts of me are just fleeting... not even enough to invite a simple e-mail.  *sigh*  I realize that its my own fault I don't talk to anyone anymore because I'm never online... but that doesn't mean I'm impossible to reach.  It would just be nice if someone out there would put out the effort to reach me.  To show me that they care... or even just to tell me what's happened to them lately... I suppose I should e-mail all of you... but its hard to do when there's nothing happening to me... I have nothing to say but I miss you and love you and can't wait to see you again... *sigh* That's all... I just needed to get this off my chest.  I'm not... I'm not all THAT mad or anything, not at everyone... Becca and Abbey, maybe, but I can understand why I don't hear from everyone else.  I guess I just have too much free time that I don't know what to do with since I have no one to spend it with.  I don't suppose anyone else has nearly as much wasted time and energy as I do... But anyways... I guess I'll talk to everyone later..."

"event","And so, after a lon hyatus from the internet, I have given in and finally dragged my poor overheating laptop to school to sit in the cafeteria til it closes and take advantage of the wireless internet here.

I just got back from Spring Break... and I wish it hadn't ended. Sure, we didn't do anything special, and I was driving ALOT (boy, my legs felt like jelly when I got home), and even though I missed my ferrets more than anything... it was nice.  I got to spend so much time with Dani and Chrislea... I'd almost forgotten what it was like to stay up past my bedtime doing nothing but hanging out.  I'd forgotten what it was like having friends that you didn't have to go out and do anything with, and still have so much fun.  I had a hard time leaving when I was dropping them off.  I didn't have anything to say really, but I couldn't get my feet to move to the car.  I wish it hadn't ended.  It was kinda funny... As I was driving through Houston after dropping Dani off a song came on that I've always loved, but suddenly it made a lot more sense to me. I'd put in my first Fuel CD, and Shimmer came on... I nearly cried, but I had to pay too much attention to the road since traffic was pretty bad.
Anyways... I miss having all my friends close at hand... I don't have anyone I'm really close to down here... no one I feel I can open up to or be close too... no one I seem to share an unspoken bond with... and with me, I feel those things pretty quickly, even if it doesn't show.  
I actually went without my medicine for like, 2 or 3 days in a row, and you never would have known except that I started to get a bit grumpy and snippy... though even that could have been contributed to my having stayed up for well over 24 hours one night.
Well, not much more to update here... short on funds, as usual... trying to get a work schedule set up so I'll actually be able to start saving money again. Hopefully I'll stick to my promise and get online more like I should.
Until next time, love and kisses to all in cyber land.

You prefer mostly males, but some females catch your interest. You tend to be submissive. This will impact the interpretation of your various sexual interests. Clothing is an important part of your sexual fantasies. Materials like latex, vinyl, and leather probably excite you a great deal. You become aroused when you reveal information about yourself, or perform a sex act in a public or semi-public setting. Your mouth is a sacred area that houses a variety of sensations and desires for you. You enjoy having things in your mouth, and you enjoy teasing your tongue with a variety of different stimulation. You like sucking on fingers ... whether they are your own or those of your partner.

The ONLY thing keeping me from going insane is that cute little fuzzball occupying the big cage in my room... and he does it by driving me insane in a different way. A... a pet that needs training but is still irresistably cute way.  Grrrr... I never see my parents... I never see my friends... this both blows and SUCKS.  Dad is home for the weekend, but after throwing a fit in the kitchen while I tried my best to ignore him and enjoy cartoons, he ran off with his buddy John. As for mom... she's working today.  Like she does EVERY day... I think I'll go to a movie... that's one of the few activities I don't feel embarrassed about doing alone. And I could just thrive on popcorn or something. -_-"

Alright, this telemarketer calls, trying to sell me a subscription to the New York Times, get a month free, blah blah blah and all that... well, he doesn't try very hard, but instead ends up just talking.  ABOUT EVERYTHING.  Ok, so its this 21 year old guy named Andrew.  I didn't catch where he was from, but we talked about college (and the financing thereof), music, his Mom's new Mitsubishi Lancer, and all sorts of stuff.  SO WEIRD!!!  I've never had one just sit and talk like that. Poor guy must've been really bored at work. But anyway, so he asked for my e-mail and he's apparently going to e-mail me at some point. I dunno... I don't really care or anything... it was just SO WEIRD. I'm talking to this telemarketer for like, 20 minutes or something.  Well, mostly I just said, ""Yeah, Oh I KNOW!"" while he talked... but still. It was just strange. Well, anyway... I'm prolly gonna be stalked or have my identity stolen or get a lot of porn spam now... but whatever.  I just thought I'd talk about this in here because it was so random. So yeah... His mom is a postal worker who's going to be retiring soon, raised 4 kids by herself, he couldn't get much grant money or financial aid, but he had friends in 2 story luxury houses who were on full ride. And that's just a little bit about what we talked about. I'm just so baffled right now.  But I think everyone out there should have a random telephone convo with a perfect stranger.  Its very interesting."

"event","Ok... so today was the first day... started out innocently enough.  I got to school WAY too early, but managed to get an allright parking spot, not great, but mildly decent.  So anyway, I park and drag my big ass guitar in there.  I was like, 30 minutes early and the first one there, but people started showing up soon enough... most people being quite friendly and talkative.  I was in a good mood, so I was yakking away at a mile a minute.  Kind of embarrassing, now that I think about it.  I mean, my big mouth got me roped into an extra class.  But its just Chamber Choral, so I'm actually pretty ok with that.  I haven't sung in a choir or anything in quite awhile... so it feels good to be doing it again.  But that class is after Japanese.  After Guitar (We got out a little early, so I dropped off my guitar in my car first) I headed across the creek to my next class... Japanese 1.  It was incredibly easy... but I guess I should have expected that from the first day of Japanese 1.  Watashi no Nihongo no sensei wa Huransujin desu. Yeah, I thought that was funny.  But he's pretty cool.  Both of my teachers were late today.  Like... seriously late for the guitar teacher, and only slightly late for the Japanese teacher.  Before Japanese class I thought about my journal, so I started writing stuff down as I sat there since I wasn't even remotely inspired at the time to doodle.  I did doodle afterwords though. Oh HOW I DOODLED.
Anyways, here is the entire manuscript of today's pre-Japanese ramblings:
There's a hot guy in Jap. 1.  Asian, and his hair is just like Hikaru's.  All the Asian kids sit together... but I will try to admire them from afar... wishing to be one of them.  All the white guys so far have been very nerdy.  Not like, skinny w/ glasses and a pocket protector, but slightly bulky with an air of ""I've been picked on for being so smart.""  The kind who <u>think</u> they'll be the next Bill Gates.  Fanboy types, but its hard to tell if they like Anime, though I suppose being in Jap. 1 <u>IS</u> a bit of a giveaway.  I guess I shouldn't have advertised my own geekiness by wearing my Mashi Maro shirt - but I couldn't help myself.  Its cute.  I haven't been paying attention.  There's a cute white guy next to all the Asian kids. Well, I solved the fanboy mystery.  I'm surrounded by them. Cute latino boy alert! Ok, I'm happy.  3 choices.  Eye candy enough for little ol' me. Man, they're such nerds though! Talking about the different DVD regions....  [FIN]
Ok, so later I realized there were 4 eye candies.  The first one with the Hikaru hair is Korean and another Asian boy who is half Chinese half Tai.  The white boy and the Latino, who's American... just tan with dark hair. I didn't catch any of their names today... but I shall!!! And I shall stalk them mercilessly!!!  As far as my Mashi Maro shirt... I spilled Chili soup stuff on it as soon as I got home and had lunch. >(  There isn't much to say about Chamber Choir (The one I was recruted for) except that it should prove challenging, I'm an alto, and the teacher sets of my GayDar.

Well... that concludes today... I shall update again tomorrow after my second set of classes.  Much love! MOI!!! *kissies*"

"event","Well! Today is the first day of classes for me... and I'm pretty nervous and excited.  I start the day with guitar, which I don't know what to expect there, and then I have Japanese.  And I'm out around noon.  So I'll ceck back in later to tell you all how that goes.

Something I forgot to write about yesterday:
I was going to go to the Mike & Spike's Sick and Twisted animation fest, but the people in front of us in line bought the last tickets.  So they were sold out.  Only slightly bummed by the ordeal, the posse (Me, Rachel, Christi and Russ) stood around near the Magnolai Theater laughing and showing off our best dance moves (IE: Sprinkler, Lawn Mower, White Girl, Copy Machine, The Riff Raff, etc) to the music of the club across the street.  After awhile my mother suggested we go to Denny's to which we promptly responded that Denny's was evil, but IHOP sounded good.  Of course... It took me awhile to remember where an IHOP was... but we ended up settling for the one near Webb Chapel on Forest Lane... which was all I could remember about its location and we turned the wrong way first, but found it without too much difficulty.  Well, dinner (Breakfast? It was around 1:30-2) was pleasant... full of sexual humor as usual.  At the end the waiter came by and asked if he could take our plates, to which my mom used her usual joke of ""Oh, I was thinking of taking them home with me.""  AND HE ACTUALLY SAID YES.  He'd been there for some 11 hours apparently.  So he brought us a bag and we put the plates in it, left him a GOOD tip and left.  And when I say we left, we stood in the parking lot for about hour and talked, laughed, danced, and generally celebrated the evening.  It was nice... and something I've missed this summer... but I suppose it bodes well for the semester at hand.  I'm very grateful that everyone came, even though they were tired, or had restrictions to the mileage on their car, or had to bug the crap out of their mom to do it... It means a lot to me.

Well... that didn't take nearly anough time to write... and I got up WAY to early this morning.  I didn't know how long it would take me to get everything done that I needed to do... but it was definitely excessive.  I will remember that next time.  Let's just say that class starts at 10 and I was done getting ready at 8:30.  Yeah.  I thought so too.  Plus its overcast today so my connection is screwy... I prolly won't be online tonight, or much for the next week for that matter, as there's a chance of rain through Sunday.  Which I hope it DOES rain because our yard needs it.  But it sucks for my internet connection.  ANYWAY... So YEAH.  This weekend is going to be awesome too!!!! I can't wait for everyone to get here.  Lalala... trying to waste more time so I'm not so damned early.  And I wish I had a cigarette... but mom and I both are going to quit.  I HAD quit, but its so hard to quit when they're RIGHT THERE. So yeah, and mom was supposed to quit at the end of this last carton... which the last pack went with her to work today.  So I'm without. :(  But oh well... I need to quit anyway. I'm gonna go ahead and post this even though I have plenty of time to keep rambling... My connection is up at the moment and I don't want to miss a window of opportunity.  Bye guys!  Good luck in all your wandering and adventures!!!"

I don't like that mom works two jobs.

I miss the summers where I slept til 2 and then would go be a bum at the mall with my best friends... but those days seem long past. Now just shopping isn't enough... I lack so much excitment and company that a simple walk around a mall satisfies very little.  I'm a human being, despite what seems to be a very common misconception. Unlike a chat-bot... I have a pile of organs, topped with a big juicy brain! Much like a sundae. Only, I'm not a Sundae... I'm a human... so kinda like a human sundae. The only company I keep anymore is Scuzzy, my ferret.  He satisfies a great deal of the need for love and companionship... but he doesn't talk.  I can't talk or just sit calmly with him and think.  He's a ferret. He doesn't really think a whole lot except in terms of ""OOOOO! Wha' Dat???"" To think that my only friend is a warm-blooded snake with legs. ^^  Anyways, I'm gonna cut this pity-party short. I can say one thing for my happy pills and Scuzzy... it IS a lot easier to let it go. I mean, yeah I'm depressed at the moments, but I'm not sitting on my bed sobbing and refusing to leave it. I CAN still function at least. Alright... I'm off, hoping to never see many of you again. Hah hah... just kidding. I'm just hoping never to see SOME of you again. Ok, ok... so that's a lie too. I'm really just very lonely.  And now that I'm no longer so sad, my mind resorts instead to anger. I now have anger-management issues instead of depression. Who knew?"

"event","... is that movies of the 70s suck.  They do.  They're just bad.  Even the good ones are pathetic. Wanna argue? Oh... what about horror movies?  They sucked too. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a mishmash of good elements that really just didn't congeal for me.  It had ONE good plot twist.  It had TWO interesting characters and a guy with a chainsaw. It had one LONG ASS CHASE SCENE shot in the exact same spot of woods from different angles. It had some good slash, and it had a few spots that had an excellently creepy mood and moderate mese 'en scene. But that was it.  It also had some LONG ASS sitting around watching some doofballs spend summer vacation that was supposed to pass for character developement for characters who die in two seconds. It was a bit boring most of the time.  Now, I understand why its a classic, because it had its moments... but it was a GOOD 70s movie, and quite frankly it was terrible.  Ok... so what about Stanley Kubrick?  Um... Space Odessey? Has anyone sat through that entire movie and enjoyed it when not ON DRUGS?? It was dull, at best. Long... arduous.... and painful.  A classic? YES. Because again, it was a GOOD 70S MOVIE.  Which is sad.  
Now... I was going to let these go by the wayside... but no.  I say that among the various decades before the 90s, the 70s was the worst, and then I get 3 people who feel it is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT to prove me wrong. It is difficult to argue with three people at once. Especially when they are on the same side as eachother, each feel that they know more on the subject than you do, and don't take the time to actually absorb what you have to say or even listen to your own arguments before rebutting them. I meant to say that if you took THE WORST 10 movies of each decade, that the ones from the 70s would by far be worse than any of the others from any of the other decades... and so they start naming good 70s movies. Which even then, they DON'T ADD UP.  Classic DOES NOT equal good.  It only means that it has a large fanbase... which unfortunately says NOTHING for the movie itself.  Star Wars epsisodes 1 and 2 have HUGE fanbases... which says nothing for the horrible script, acting, and reliance on special effects to carry a floundering franchise.  Sorry fanboys, no dice.  So I hate the human race and their desire to change my mind and brainwash me to think just like everyone else.  Stanley Kubrick... 70s horror films... they do NOT equal even one Ferris Bueller's Day Off... The Last Unicorn... Casa Blanca... I can't think of anything good for the 50s and 60s because I'm not an expert.  And you know what... I realise that I have not seen EVERY MOVIE on the face of this planet... I just know that I have seen some BAD movies... and the worst of them were from the late 60s and 70s. I have been unable to watch more movies from that decade than any other.... and that is MY experience.  MY opinion.  I'm going to go have a smoke now before I give myself a hernia. Peace out, movie buff(oon)s."

"event","I think its because my life has been so turbulent since 6th grade... not spending more than 2 years in one place, ever.  And now I'm back home... back in Dallas... and I feel like its time to pick up and move again... to go somewhere new.  I don't quite understand it myself, because I don't really want to leave or go anywhere.  Its just this feeling... the need for a new space to live... the need for space at all... the need for space to call my own.  I want to go home where its safe and comfortable, but even so my feet won't be still. I'm restless... pacing. I've been in one place for too long and its time for me to start all over again.  But where would I go?  And why?  I can't justify it anyways... why spend the money when I can go home? When I can be with my mom and dad? And my cats?  Am I restless for home, or a place to call my home. Even in my house, I don't feel comfortable in my room.  The only place I even feel comfortable in my own house is in the living room, on the big sofa in front of the TV... or maybe in the backyard.  I need room for my things... I need room to live and settle and make my own.  I'm territorial by nature and I know that instinc says its time to leave the nest.  But I can't justify it by any more than that.  Home is cheap, and comfortable... and I'll be with mom.  I can destress there.  Unwind.  My dad drives me crazy, but I love the old bastard anyway.  I'm just so antsy at the moment... as if my future sways in the balance, but just beyond view.  I think I'll do a reading on it to see what's going on... or what I should do.  I think maybe it'll clear up once finals are over... so we'll see.  We'll see....."

"event","You know... I know I'm not the easiest person to get close to... I'm not openly affectionate... but its really because I'm a lot shyer than most people think I am.  I'm afrai of touching people because I never feel like they want me to touch them, so the only way for me to do it is by tickling, or warting or hitting... or anything of the sort.  Very few people ever try to get close to me.  I don't smell bad... and I'm not hideously deformed... so why don't people ever get too close to me?  I just... I need to be touched and hugged and things like that just like everyone else. And no one really knows very much about me either. I forgot to put an away message up at all today, and I didn't even get any ""Where are you?... hello??""  Kind of messages. No one talks to me, and I know I'm not the most talkative person ever... but its because I'm bad at small talk. Tell me you're hurting and I'll be there for you, or that you have a problem and I'll try to help you sort it out... or even just talk to me about some kind of philosophical or social or world issue and I can go on for hours... but no one knows me at all for that.  They know me as loud... or funny in a dark way... I'm a clown and no one knows the thoughts or feelings beneath the surface... unless of course I'm bitching about something.  And even then its always with a ""I know you have it rough, but...""  Kind of feeling. I just... I'm lonely. I want someone to dig... to find something in me that they can really love... to find something that they really care about... a reason to get close. I want someone to find me attractive and let me know it.  For all my ego, I'm so very tiny... and frail...  My only defence is to block it all out and act out, but rarely does a person try to get past that wall. I think Rachel and Becca are the only two to ever get past it, even for a little.  But I think part of that is that I'm around them so much. Spend enough time with a person and you're bound to discover a little deep thing, or be physically affectionate.  It just feels so awkward for me to reach out to someone... I never feel as though they realy want me to, so I curl away and hide behind myself.  Behind a strong face that could defeat the world with a simple glare. No one knows that its just an act.  A shell created for the sole purpose of keeping me alive... of keeping friends by making them laugh at my dirty and outrageous antics.  Its not me at all.  I can be funny, really funny... but I'm reduced to simple slapstick.  I need someone... anyone... who would bare themselves to me and draw me out.  I want to know someone, but I want them to want to know me too. Few people ask me personal questions, even though I've never made any attempts to hide anything.  Is that why they don't ask?  They know I'd tell, and they don't really want to know?  I can't tell anymore.  I also wonder why I never get hit on... I know I'm not repulsive, at least I don't think I am... and most people tell me I'm cute or not so bad... so why not?  Why can't anyone try to take advantage of me?  I would probably let them, if I only felt that they wanted me. Could someone ever be really honest with me?  If I don't want to hear it I won't... so no one has to worry about hurting me... I just need the truth... whatever it may be... I need love, but honesty would be just as rewarding I think... at least then I would know.  Not knowing is something that hurts the most... Just ask... just tell... please......"

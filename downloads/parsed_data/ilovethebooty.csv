I don't care about you and your fucking issues.. you just need to know that you are fucking sick and pathetic to have used Carlos's funeral to get out of your senior project.. despite what you say and all the excuses you make.. you had a chance to come say goodbye to him, whether you needed the funeral or not to do that...
you sit here and complain that Nancy and Carlos's family hate you so much.. well then you should have tried to reconcile that.. not in a note.. not over the fone.. in person!....You didnt give a flying Fuck about Carlos.. and everyone around me sees that... not only do we see it you've proven it to us!... less than a month after Carlos's death you take him outta your profile, stop writing your sad poems and song lyrics in your journal,and you fucking have sex with Spencer...wow can I explain how tight you are... its a surprise to me that you have any friends at all...

"event","*Friday*
After school went with Leann to party city to get decorations and other shit for Dylan's graduation party... then we met Alicia at <i>Lightning Jack's</i> in the Clairemont Square... haha we all were sitting at the table and I leaned forward to grab my cellphone, and the chair slipped right out from under my ass.. and I ended up on the floor... haha embarrassing as hell but funny... then this fat ass bitch sitting at the table next to us goes ""looks like someone fell off their ego"" ... dumb ass broad.
Then we went to Alicia's and chilled for awhile.. then off to the gym.. HELL YEAH!!... man I don't think that I have ever ran so long in my life...Leann had her training session and I was up in the hot room (thats the room with the good treadmill's, but it has no fans or air conditioning).. I got stuck next to this guy who was about 450 pounds and smelled like dog shit... Leann finished up her session and we went to go sit in the Sauna and I checked my fone I had 2 missed calls.. one from James the pimp, and the other from Los's house... so I called his house and Cita picked up... they were all there just hanging out... and they asked if we could come over... so  we went to Leann's and showered it up, and went over... IT WAS SOO FUCKING FUN ... we were playing basketball and it was Jhett and Leann vs. Cita and I ... man whatta workout ..haha we got Friendtree flowers this time... haha .. Junior and this other girl were outside...Junior is joing the NAVY!!... what a pimp!... Carlos and him had planned on doing that for awhile and now he is doing it... I AM SOO PROUD OF HIM!... I went inside to go see how Rachel was doing (she has strep throat)... poor thing... Mike Came over... that guy is by far the nicest person I have ever met... the SHIRTS ARE IN!!!!... so excited to get one...he listened to the voicememo's and mail's from Carlos... and in one of them Carlos says ""I want you, but I can't have you right now"" .. it was a voicememo from 2 days before we were going out ... and Mike goes ""thats all you need.. at least you can listen to that eveynight and know that he wants to be with you but he can't be"".. he goes ""get it?"" ... ""he's still with you just not here"".. he really made me feel better... then we left at like  10:45 and went to see Ky and Shayne... then went home

*Saturday*
shopped all day ...went home...

*Sunday*
Nancy(Carlos's mom) called me at 10: 30 ish to ask me for some help and to tell me that the police report was in!.. its about damn time.. she had to go because she needed to get some information from people who spent that day with him ...the PI is going to be calling people soon.. its gonna bring alot of shit back up.. we all know.. its just finalyzing the fact that he is actually gone... ITS REALLY HARD... his family is tha best tho!

"event","Today is Carlos and I's 2 month anniverary, and the one month anniversary of his death.... It's really hard to know he is gone but today was actually pretty good... instead of crying we celebrated his life...Leann and I went to Jhetturo's house(Carlos's dad) ... and we picked up Rachel, and Cita and went to his site... his site is not looking to good..when we got there Candles were lit which was good.. that means someone had been there and visited but everything was gone... no balloons, flowers (except for a few).. and a few notes and poems... the whole fence looked as if it was going to collapse and fall over at any moment... but we were all just remembering the good times... haha... funny stuff... then we went back to Jhetturo's house and played with Jhett(Carlos's little brother) ... mostly leann ... but still... he is  hands down the cutest thing I have ever seen... Rachel told me her mom had beeen going thru Carlos's clothes and came up on his Miles Davis shirt...he wore that thing on seriously EVERY date we ever went on .. and it brought back soo many memories... IT EVEN SMELLED LIKE HIM ... after like an hour or so of just talking and hanging out with his family we left and went back to Leann's to a bombin dinner.. she had a portion for a mouse ... hahhaha.. it was hilarrious ... we were so TIRED still even after an hour and a half nap .. so we watched real world and off to bed!...

"event","Where to start...

This month has been by far the hardest thing I've had to go thru in my ENTIRE life.. All the people I have ever lost have gone in a matter of two years...
1. My Grandpa:Papi(Lung Cancer)(January 1,2003)
2. A close Friend:Mikey Timmons(Hit by a car while crossing the street)(December 13,2003)
3. My Boyfriend:Carlos(Hit by a drunk fucker in the crosswalk walking home)(April 14,2004)

The hardest By far has been Carlos's death. There is this huge emptiness not only in my heart but in my life.. I don't think there is one thing I do that doesn't remind me of him. It's already been one month (well his one month is tomarrow), and to tell you the truth I don't know how I've gotten thru this.. other than the fact I have awesome supportive friends that are here for me 110%... There will never be a guy like Carlos or even one that can fill his position..He will forever be the LOVE OF MY LIFE...just like little Brandon always says... ""just because he is gone doesn't mean that he isn't still with you"".. that is very true....but on the other hand Carlos wouldn't want me to sit here and Cry about it, and wait all of my life to find someone again. He would tell me to be happy and live it up.. I know in my heart I will move on when the time is right, but I will never fully be over him... and I shouldn't be expected too... if I love him as much as I say I do than of course I will never be over him, but I will have to find someone who can show me just as much Love and compassion as he has. It would be our two-month anniversary tomarrow..and I can just tell.. I'm not going to be a happy camper... I've been pretty good with holding in my emotions unless I'm around Leann, and we both just say ""fuck it"" and let everything out.. we both sit and just think about how fucked up both of our lives are.. and then we sit there and laugh about how this shit just all needs to stop ... I mean seriously... WHAT MORE COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN?!?... I know that God has his plans or whatever.. but me and Leann figure that we are both at about negative fifteen right now, so things could only move up from here...
I think God does thigs to prove points or to make us stronger..who knows why he does the things he does.. but I know that ever since Carlos passed, I pray everynight... I've turned to him.. I've put my life in his hands, and it is his to make of it what he wants... God doesn't do things to put us thru pain.. he does things for a reason, and behind everything he does there is a purpose for it ... just knowing that helps me to get thru each day...

*I Love you Los*


This friday was May Crowning mass and it seriously took about 2 hours... it was one of the longest masses I have ever been too... But it was worth while. I was sitting next to Leann, Justine and Ryan.. and Ryan was high as fuck... it was HILLARIOUS... we all stood up at the end of mass, and he started chanting ""FRESHMAN,FRESHMAN"" .. hahaha... and then he finds this little square box made out of paper and he couldn't beleive tha ""AMAZING CRAFTSMANSHIP"" it was built with... haha I don't know it was just plain funny me and Leann were cracking up the entire mass.. Then we had like 30 minute classes which was great cuz we didn't do jack shit in any of them..and the day went by hella fast.. then I went with Leann, Ryan, Ryan's brother and CJ to drop Ryan's brother off... Ryan came with Leann,CJ, and myself to the beach.. it was hot as hell on friday!.. then we met up with Derrick, Robert, Teddy, Cassy, Nick and Dane.. and we went and chilled at fiesta island.. it was pretty tight...


ME AND BRAIN FINALLY SAW NEW YORK MINUTE... I AM BUYING THAT SHIT ON DVD THE SECOND IT COMES OUT.. IT WAS SOO FUNNY!!!.. "" umm, can you give me some space please!!?"" ... haha funny shit..
Saturday went to L.A -- saw the familia.. my cousin broke up with her boyfriend that she has been with for 3 years and just recently moved in with, so she was like playing all anti- social.. I guess I understand but what is locking yourself up in your room not talking to anyone going to do for you ??..NOTHING.... but everyone handles things differently I guess...
Sunday --- I cleaned and went to church.. not a very fun day...

Tommarrow I'm going to the site with Alicia, and Leann and hopefully seeing his family afterwards..

*Nancy,Rachel,Jhetturo,Jhett,Cita, and all Los's friends and family your in my prayers*

Nicole- when I hear you tell people shit about Leann and I at school it doesn't really give me any insentive to trust you..."

"event","<i>Friday went like this :</i>
Got to school and I had first period with Leann she turns and tells me she doesn't have her car because its broken so Alicia told us we could go with her after school to go to Party City, Leann's, Alicia's, deliver Ky's present, go get a mother's day gift and then go to see New York Minute... We go to Party City and bought the two cake pans,and the pink and skin colored icing.. with Leann's discount it came to be quite the bargain.. haha ... Nicole calls us cuz she was supposed to come help us, and says she can't stay and help but she could buy the cake batter, and the white frosting. We get back to Alicia's and wait for Nicole, and then we started baking.. while the cakes were baking we went and picked up Lil' B (Brandon) probally one of the nicest and sweetest guys I've ever met... he really helps with alot of things... he is such a good person to talk to... but anyways we got back to the house and frosted the cakes... then we decided to go drop them at Aly's were Ky was... they almost didn't make it thru the car ride may I add... BUT THEY WERE STILL BY FAR THE BEST TITTIES CAKES EVER!!!... Ky loved em! ... We got there and hung out with Ky, Sheri, Mike, Elise, Brandon, Aly, and John came later... it was getting to be around 7:30 ish and we still hadto go get a gift .. so Me, Alicia, and Leann decided to Leave...we get into the car and Alicia goes to start the car.. and guess what happens next????? ....
IT WOULDN'T START... we tried everything.. Jmping it, pushing the gas pedal, coolant, oil... everything imaginable... so after about an hour and a half.. Leann calls her mom and tells her to come get us.. so she picks us up and we got to get Alicia some coolant. We get back and give her the coolant, adn after all that when we were gone at Autozone, the damn thing started!!!!.. wow what a day!

Saturday:
I went to my Grandma's house and had this family dinner thing...for Mother's day. It was funny actually... but yea it always is... my family is VERY random... then I got back here at like 9:30 and finished my book... wow what a shocker at the end... but yea, then at like 11:50 Leann and Victor call me .. they were driving around trying to find a taco bell... no luck!.. they wer all closed...Vicotr had to go adn said he would call me back .. and he definatley did at 1:38 in the morning.. but it's all good my phone was on silent and I didn't get the calls until the morning ... but one good thing about Saturday was that is was ... KYRON'S 18Th BIRTHDAY!!!..... HAPPY BIRTHDAY PIMP!!!... that was pretty much my weekend other than on Sunday I took my mom to lunch and then to a movie that she wanted to see. Pretty Gay weekened... but its all good...

* BACK TO FUCKING SCHOOL * 

Monday: Had to wake up at the ass crack of dawn like always... got to school .. another shitty day...but hey whats new... most of my friends are mad at each other, or have drama.... SUZIE HAS A BOYFRIEND by the name of Gerry .. so happy for you girl!... Monica got a job at D'Lush and got me this cool cha cha chai poster... haha wow its great... Thanks!... I think thats about all that happened on monday.
Tuesday: School REALLY sucked today ... it was going good until my last period.. we watched this movie called ""why bad things happen to good people"" .. it hurt soo-0o0o0-o0o bad to watch it.. I couldn't help but sit there and think about Carlos the entire time... I started crying in the middle of class, really embarassing but I've come to the realization I have to let my feelings out I can't hold them all inside. I LOVE YOU CARLOS AND I MISS YOU SO MUCH. I NEED YOU NOW MORE THAN EVER. I can't even begin to comprehend why he was taken from all of us. The movie didn't solve anything for me.. there really are no answers. no reasons. what did he ever do to deserve this?? .. yea I know he is in a better place and he is happy now... but it hurts so much to know that he isn't here anymore, and he will never be here again.. I can never tell him I love him and hear it back, I can never jsut call and talk to him because I'm having a shitty day or because I miss him .. I really have tried to be strong but this is soo hard... to tell you the truth it hasn't fully hit me yet... I know he is gone. but it just doesn't seem real... Then I get home and I get this IM from Nicole.. She really has been helping me alot.. Cuz she is feeling the same things... I mean I don't know how often she talked to him or saw him, but she says she talked to him everynight, and saw him 3 to 4 times a week... THATS ALOT!... that is a huge adjustment.. I know exactly how she feels.. I talked to him 2-3 times a day, and saw him at least 2 times a week... or as often as possible... ITS A HUGE CHANGE to have sumthing in your life thats part of your daily ritual, just be gone... 

.. it's seems as if someone lied about Los'funeral in order to postpone her senior project.WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT ?!?! ... I didn't even realize how sick people are... what the fuck.. how could you possibly be that fucked up as to say you couldn't do your project because you were going to a funeral.. WHEN YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE!!!.. it would be one thing to use that as an excuse and actually go, but its not even like that... you fucking flat out lied!!!... I can't even begin to explain how fucked that is ... and another thing ... Prom ..
hahahahaha ... wow to bad My friend Alicia has been talking to him WAY longer than you have.. and your in highschool now, maybe you should think about asking him yourself, not having your friend do it!.... this isnt third grade anymore.... and if you invite someone to prom you really shouldn't sit and talk shit about them in your classes!... just a few words of wisdom for everyone to live by:
1. DONT LIE ... it only makes the situation worse..WAY WORSE
2. Dont put the blame on EVERYBODY else except YOURSELF, you just come out looking like a bigger bitch!!!
3. DONT TALK SHIT! cuz one way or another what you say is gonna get back to the person your talking the shit about!.
4. Worry about yourself and not everybody else.. stop trying to make everyone's life shit, just cuz your not happy with yours.

I got to ride in the ""happy van"" yesterday.. Alicia took me home cuz she has lifeguard training over here!... we went to this Nail place to get her nails done for prom and i painted my nails while I was waiting for her and put my nails up to the fan to dry them and my super long pinky nail got hit by a fan blade... wow it was fucking hillarious!... even the asian guy doing her nails was laughing hysterically... I think I jumped about 10 feet.. when that happened... it scared me!.. haha Alicia started calling it the "" monster nail"" cuz the guy mumbled sumthing ... i dunno it was just funny!...

Today: 
Today was alright ... my little ray of sunshine, Leannmeister, was on the down side... but its all good we turned that frown upside down in no time... I HAD A KILLER MATH TEST TODAY .. bombed that shit!!... and then to top the day off, I had cat dissection right after lunch... I can't touch the cat .. I feel queezy just looking at it let alone touching it... NEVER!!!... I can't do it so my group Dani, and Rachel do the dissecting and I am the secretary... it owrks out alot better that way... 
CJ THAT LITTLE FUCKER trys to touch me with his cat gloves... PROBALLY NOT!... your not that smooth.. lol .. oh and I'll have you all know he is back to making  fun of me... haha ... and then when I get mad at himm he goes ""I love you Rios!!!"" ... I could never stay mad at that kid he is way to CJish... haha if that makes any sence!... other than that nothing much really ... movie and pocorn postponed till friday ... BUMMER!... and I have to go to the gym tommarrow I really have been slacking off and football is starting on Monday!.. ahh .. it came up fast... I don't know if I even want to play anymore... it's just not about the sport anymore.. people aren't really into it.. Tyler isn't playing... Coach White isn't going to be my coach anymore cuz he is going to westview... I don't know.....I got to make my mind up soon tho .. I only have a couple of days.


But Yea I think that was pretty much a novel ... and I'm out of things to say for right now...(that rarely happens).. but I'm out ..
Much Love!



* oh I forgot to add... on Friday we went past Carlos's memorial.. it looked really nice, its good to know people are keeping it going, and 
taking care of it *

Oh and I got the most bombin' ringtone ever... SAVED BY THE BELL THEME SONG... super tight!"

"event","Talked to Ky last night...
made my entire night, and then to make it even better I talked to John.. Here's the dilemma it's Kyron's birthday on Saturday and he really wants a hotel party.. 
1.People are not gonna help put money in.
2.Someone is going to end up paying for it all by themselves or with the help of two or three people.
3.There are gonna be alot of people there who are gonna be fucking freeloaders. 
4.Alcohol is going to need to be purchased and people are gonna drink the shit but not put money in for it .. (again, Freeloading)
5.Its Ky's birthday its not <i><u>up to him to him to pay</i></u>
6.There is bound to be a fight with all the different ""varieties"" of people there... 
7.People are going to show up who probally dont even know Ky... 
8. and with all these shit-faced people there  stuff going to be broken,we are going to get in trouble for the noise, and we will end up getting kicked out.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALEX!!!!!!!!!!

John is such a pimp he really made me smile yesterday. I'm sorry you had a bad day yesterday and that you got your ass sunburned... thats all part of the pain in the ass of working. But you at least are making bank right now. your definately the homie for life..thanks for all you do ....Much Love<u>Pimp!!!</u>

Ky thanks so much for what you wrote in my journal you trully are one of the greatest people I know. Know I am here for you and I love you. Man I can't wait to give you your birthday gift... your gonna love it. 

oh and to Erika..
My post was not intended to come off in a rude/bitchy way. I know it wasnt you who wrote that I was just commenting to tell Ash that Nicole actually did get that right. like I said I don't have any negative feelings twords you and I wouldnt want to start shit after all this shit just got fixed. Peoplewho wanna fucking comment in your journal anonymously or whatever are retarded and dont listen to what people say.. as long as you know what really true thats all the matters. Sorry people are fucking dick heads... but you gotta look at it in a positive way obviously people have NO LIFE if they are going to CONTINUE to comment about stupid shit in ur LJ..then FUCK THEM its not worth your time. and the update I made wasnt about you either its about stupid petty bullshit that a select few UNI kids try to pull. Im sure there are people at your school who try and pull that shit too ... like they think we wont fucking find out that they talk shit or sumthing.. wow .. but anyways.. confusion sorry.

* Oh man I hate reading, but I started this bombin' book called ""Addicted"" ... its a fucking good book.. gotta read it.. Justine lent it to me, and its really good. *

Well I think thats it... today was alright my teachers are tight as fuck ... and oh yea... IT WAS FUCKING HOTTER THAN HELL!... I had a long-sleeve Black polo on: Definatley not good..

but yea thats it for now... New York Minute Tomarrow!!!... with Leannmeister.. cant wait!.."

"event","Leann's Journal entry really made alot of sence... 
People throw the word love around as if its nothing... Love is something that is expressed not only in thought but in actions. It is sacred. It is a feeling that is undescribable.
She is right when she says live everyday as your last..live your life to the fullest... you only live once.. make sure to surround yourself with a positive group of people... the more I sit here and talk to her the more I just realize how people make everyhting about themselves, and if they aren't making it about themselves they are talking shit about others... still making others look to them as if they are some kind of superhero or sumthing or trying to get pitty from others.. DRAMA IS BULLSHIT... and I've come to realize who my true friends are.. I may not be the one you are talking shit about, but when you sit there and talk shit about the people I consider my best friends, that I love and care for more than anyhting..that really makes me mad.. I do apprectiate everyones sympothy and prayers... but a week after all of this happened everyone is back to normal except for the SELECT few who ACTUALLY DO CARE.. I know that I need to begin to move on.. but I'm not ready for that yet, everything reminds me of him, and I cannot be expected to get over someone that I love in 2 weeks... if you didn't know it's going to be awhile I'm really having some trust issues and there is a spot in me that is empty and I know that spot will never be completly filled, but until I can begin to trust people, and maybe get to know people for themselves before anything happens.. I don't see me moving on for quite some time...I can honestly say that right now I trust a total of 3 people.Carlos was my boyfriend, a best friend,the person I loved,the guy I wanted to be with for the rest of my life. Yes, I do understand that he may not have been that to all of you but he was a BEST FRIEND to two of my best Friends and close with mostly all of the people I hang out with... (only 2 from UNI. Leann & Alicia) but that does not give you the right to sit here and give your outlook on the situation. It would be different if you approached it in a different way.. but instead you all sit in your little corner whispering your little secrets...I'm glad you all have men in your life that you care about maybe even love.. it's the best feeling in the world.. TRUST ME I KNOW.. but when you sit there and basically rub it in our faces about how shit-faced you all get, and about the great hook-ups.. it just goes to show how heartless you all are.. Me and Leann are almost in the identical position she may not have literally lost the man she loves, but physically she has..This time is so hard for all of us, and I wouldn't expect any of you to know what it feels like especially those of you who don't know Carlos.. now is DEFINATLEY not the time to be sitting and whispering if you have something to say at least have the decency to say it to our faces, Sorry that me and Leann have found someone(s) who makes the pain go away at least for a portion of the day, who gets our minds off whats going on... and just lets us be us for awhile, adn laugh and just have a good time... Im not gonan sit here and say that I have never shit talked.. cuz I would be lying if I did.. but never would I think of saying one thing to your face and turning around and saying the complete opposite to EVERYONE else. I know that I have some WONDERFUL friends, I may not have 30 close personal friends but the ones I do have are good enough for me.. I have been blessed to have them in my life to be there, to support, and just to lean on. Love is an abused word and Carlos would be the first to tell ya that.. we had the deepest conversation one night about how guys only say what they think you want to hear. well im not going to name any names but SOMEONE is turning what he said into an actuall reality. If you don't feel it then don't say it. and that goes for everyhthing not just love. I think the reason me, Alicia, and Leann get along so well, is due to the fact that we are BRUTALLY honest with each other sometimes its so honest its hurtful... but thats a good thing.. I would rather here the truth than to sit there and waste my time being lied to... Just remeber that...
* IF YOU DON'T MEAN IT THEN DON'T SAY IT! * 

and as far as living everyday as your last... you may not do that.. but try to make the best outta things.. maybe before looking at all the negatives look at the positives...just be thankful for everyhting you have.. because I know if its one thing that I've taken from all of this.. It's to value and tresure what you have. because things can go just as easily as they came. I AM TRULLY BLESSED TO HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW CARLOS AS WELL AS I DID.. AND TO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRUE LOVE AND COMPANIONSHIP. THERE IS NOT A DAY THAT GOES BYE WHERE I DONT STOP TO THANK GOD FOR LETTING ME HAVE HIM IN MY LIFE FOR AS LONG AS I DID. HE WAS A TRUE BLESSING, AND NOW THAT HE IS GONE, I KNOW HOW MUCH I TOOK FOR GRANTED. BEING ABLE TO SEE HIM, TALK TO HIM, BE WITH HIM... JUST EVERYTHING.. HIS SPOT WILL NEVER BE RELPACED... CARLOS, I MISS YOU MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW... I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE TIMES I TOOK YOU FOR GRANTED, AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY THIS PROUDLY AND WITH ALL MY HEART AND ALL THAT I AM ... I LOVE YOU."

New Favorite Song :

Watch this...

(Chorus)
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I dont know what to do
I guess I gotta keep part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

(Verse 1)
Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

(Chorus)
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

(Verse 2)
Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said one second baby please hear me

(Chorus)
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

(Breakdown)
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

(Chorus)
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta keep part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions"

"event","* Well My Day was actually pretty good... and it all has to do with having the bestest friends ever... Alicia and Leann thank you so much for being here thru all of this...and Dani thanks so much you really have helped alot... LAFBNN .. haha never forget that ... Robert and C.J you both are amazing and have put so many things into perspective.. thanks for brigtening my day...

I talked to Carlos's mom .. Nancy for a good hour last night... I love that lady to death .. she really just keeps me smiling.. and to know she turns to me when she needs sumthing... makes me even happier... I mean I thought I was in a lot of pain but I can't even begin to comprehend what she is going thru... Losing a boyfriend and one of my best friends is bad but losing a son must be un-bearable.. she filled me in with whats going on .. and is keeping me posted as stuff happens... no trial date is set yet.. but I can guarentee you that I will be there thru every second of it ... We just talked about the good times... and she was talking to me about what Los had said to her...  it just was really good for both us ... I'm glad she called.. I really needed that...


I really can't even describe to you how much in life I've taken for granted... my blessings, my family, my WONDERFUL friends, my life in general, all those that mean so much to me... every breath I take, every time I'm with somebody... just everything... I have to write a story for religion class tommarow and I was really apprehensive about sharing this story with everyone... but I got to do it ... the assignment is to find a story with a moral ... and I'm going to use Carlos's story for it... I don't know how to word it tho ... gotta help me ... this is what I have so far....

Carlos was 21 ... he enjoyed things that ever other normal kid that age would... he loved to flow and free- style, hang out with his firends, skate, party, draw, make skating vidoes.. just the usual ... He was real Unique.. Carlos and I started dating awhile ago ... and he was everythign I could ask for... One of the last memories I have with him ... we went to Fashion and saw a movie... he really enjoyed it and it seemed like he was having a really good time, and we were just happy to see eachother and spend time with each other.. after the movie ended... Leann had an appointment so we had to drop Carlos off.. the next day he called me just to say Hi, and remind me that tomarrow was our anniversary not to make plans cuz we were going to hang out ... That night Carlos went over to a friends house and they went to a party.. Carlos got tired and decided he wanted to go home... So he walked .. his friends offered him a ride home but Carlos wasn't the type to inconvience anyone.. and said he would rather walk home... about 3 blocks later Carlos was hit a killed by a 19 year old drunk driver... and I never got say goodbye...

Moral of the story :
* Live everyday as your last * 
* Let people know how much they mean to you*
* Dont take life for granted *

Reflection question:
What one thing in your life that you've taken for granted??


* So that's it Tell me what you think... *"

"event","Yesterday was an interesting day... after all this stupid fighting bullshit, I realized ( with the help of Leann) that this shit is unnecissary and it needed to be put to an end...so I updated an appology and stated my feelings. Erika came on later, and I felt it was necissary to IM her.. (just in case she didn't read my journal).. we got into a serious conversation about all of this.. and relaized neither one of us had the same story. I felt I knew my role in Carlos's life as his girlfriend(and still do), but she did also.... after knowing what was going thru her mind during the week before his death and the way things were left between them...I understand why she thinks the way she thinks... We just talked about everything... It really cleared alot of shit up..I know she is going thru the same thing as I am ... they may not have been on the best of terms, but she still lost someone that played some part in her life... We discovered that people have been talking ALOT OF SHIT, and like I said before several times... KARMA'S A FUCKING BITCH.. AND ESPECIALLY TO BE TRYING TO START SHIT AT A TIME LIKE THIS... ITS GONNA COME BACK 10 TIMES WORSE!!!... you've gotta be pretty fucked up to try and start shit between people who are mourning a loss in there life... 
* all that I'm sure of right now is that I DON'T HATE OR DISLIKE Erika, and all of this time that we have spent arguing was due to some other peoples lies, and those lies are eactly what helped to make this Whole Situation better .. * 
Im glad we have gotten past this shit.. 



*But anyways onto Yesterday * 

I went to the gay ass walk-a-thon... really wasn't bad at all... I got off at 9 so it was tight... Then me and Leann went and got our hair done at Hair Hustlers. She got more blonde and I got red highlights... I don't really like it ... she put WAY to much red on top... but I guess I'll just have to get used to it... Then after that we came back to my house got ready and went to pick up Ky... I love that kid.. he is just an all around funny person... Leann and him went and got food.. and then we went to meet Alicia at Mission... We saw Mean Girls... It was funny except for the part when the girl gets hit by a FUCKING BUS!.. I didn't find that to be funny.. we were all kinda shocked after that part... I felt like a fucking loser.. I got up and walked out.. I just didn't want to see shit like that right now.. I came back after that part tho.. oh and I forgot.. I got a call from Cita ( Carlos's little sister ), and she wanted to go to the movies with us, Rachel( Carlos's older sister) wanted to go too but she was at dance class.. I told Cita I would call her back after the movie, and see what was going on... But anyways... after that Ky, Alicia, Leann, and Me just walked around tha mall, and we went to the arcade, and watched Ky do Dance Dance Revolution.. he is quite the expert when it comes to this game... 
-----> ANYWAYS<------
After that we left and Leann and Ky, took me home ( I had to be in early... fuck UNI they always get me in trouble)... but on the way... Usher's song Burn came on... and I broke down .. it was just bad... it all just hit me, that I would have been hanging out with him at the very moment... and it just sucked... I miss him so much .. more than ever yesterday!... I just don't know... but his friends have really helped me thru this.. and thats good... I love them all...

* I LoVe YoU CaRloS moRe tHaN aNyThInG iN thIs WoRlD aNd I misS yOu SoO-0o0-0o0o mucH * ...Te QuierO MuchO BaBy....
This isnt getting easier... but I'm trying to get thru this one day at a time... and staying strong with your help...

* I'm twisted cuz one side of me 
is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side I
Wanna break down and cry (ooooh) *  <--- this is why I think I really started to cry, it just really hit me...

haha but the stories, Nicole,and Ky told me about the party last night really made me smile, and feel bad at the same time... I feel bad for Mike, Val, and Ky... it sounds like they had a terrible time.. why the fuck do people have to try and start shit at parties, when people are trying to chill, and relax??!?!?but I also feel bad for Nicole.. she got punched... as far I know for no reason .. 

but yea... I'm gonna go ...

Today opened my eyes... to sumthing I really needed to see... I really need to appologize to Erika, I don't hate you, or dislike you, or have any feeling twords you. You just have to understand that as his girlfriends, I've heard different things, and I know you have too... I just have to respect that fact. We both are going to hear different things, not nessicarily meaning they are true, but people are going to say shit. I understand that your friends are going to back you up, and my friends are going to do the same. But this whole thing is getting blown outta proportion. Leann is right.. Carlos would not want us fighting over this, and like I've said its definatley not tha time. We are both grieving and I'm not gonna lie this is the hardest thing I've had to go thru, and this bullshit drama isn't helping. So I'm sorry and this really needs to stop!

*Jean- Thank you so much for the talk today you really helped me, and just know that I'm here for you if you ever need anything.. love ya lots *

* To all my friends- Thank you for being here, and I love you all more than you'll ever know. *

* Robert you brighten my day * (( Thanks for showing me that SuNsHiNe ))"

(( R.I.P ))----> I love you more than life itself. This whole time knowing you has been a rollercoaster of events. Mostly good.. some bad, but all relationships have bumps... we were able to get over our problems and see how much we truly loved each other. No one can ever mean as much to me as you did. We went out three times, and we had a wonderful realatonship. I wouldnt give the time I spent with you up for anything in the world.. I know your in a better place but the best place for you would be here with me and all your friends... we LOVE you and MISS you so-oo-0o0o0 much and the pain of you not being here is unbeleivable.. I wish more than anyhting you were here so we could sit and have one of our late night conversations.. knowing that i'll never have one of those again with you kills me inside. I wish you were here for me to just hold onto.. you've given me sooo many unforgettable memories, and I will never forget any of them.. i have your Letter and your wristband... and i hold them as great value... 


*I love you and miss you, and you will never be forgotten .. *

Obviously through getting over our problems, and talking alot more it made things better for the both of us. I am really glad that we talked things out and realized that we missed each other alot. Even if you were'nt my boyfriend, i've been very blessed to have in you in my life as one of my closest friends. You know me better than anyone else, and I'm glad I got to know you just as well...
You are such a special person, no one even comes close to comparing to you. You can make everything better all in a matter of moments, and I am so thankful to have someone like you in my life.

"event","<i> Wow so I guess you can say me and Leann are officially the biggest pimpettes ever!</i>

* So This is how it all starts... Leann and I go to her work after school to pick up her paycheck, and then we went to <b>Hair Hustler's</b> in Carlsbad where she got her new HOT blonde highlights...we get done there, and decide to go get food and go to the gym... well on the way to my House we stopped at Vons to get water and Managerial Jay( the asian that wants Leann)was there. We went over to a register to purchase our water, and I was kinda making fun of Jay saying shit like "" don't managers usually check the customers out, not bag their groceries?"" ...."" Managers usually are over the age of 17 "" .. just stuff like that... so as we were leaving Leann and I turn around and Jay and his friend are following us out of the store, we turn around and he goes ""come back over here, I want the digits"". Mind you this guy is uglyier than my left ass cheek and his Friend Randolph is soo beat there is no words to describe it. So Jay asks for Leann's number and Leann DEFINATLEY didn't want this fool calling her so he gave him another number. Then to make this whole situation even worse Randolph the cart boy goes "" so which one of you is giving me your number??"" ... I was efffin speechless so I gave him the first number that came to my head, and we definatley ran the hell outta there. As we were leaving, I noticed what looked to be some fine picketers. So we decided to go chat. We exchanged numbers and left..So from there we go to My house where we got money and gym clothes. We then went to encenata's tacos and got food ... and wow those FINE ASS guys working there were all up on Leann. Then we went to the far gym... 24 hour sport... and as soon as we got there we got a call from Mike Vons, Mike L.A, and Matt(?). we decided to go see them but on the way there we got lost and sidetracked... these 2 other asian guys signed me there number... and we called them and met them at this Del Taco which was on the way to the Mike Vons house, but when we got to the taco place we couldnt find them, and then we ran into 3 REALLY HOT black guys... wow ... too bad they were hella old. Anyways we finally found these asian kats and we went to go to talk to them... Angelus and Ceasar... Angelus wasn't really my type but Ceasar was kinda fine... and they told us the worked for budwiser and that there was a frat party at State on Thursday and they wanted us to come. After like 10 minutes we left and called Mike and went to his house and Met his bombin cousin Mike L.A and this other character Matt... he didnt really do it for me but shit let me tell you... they all smelled so good, and they were clean, and well dressed, and FUCKING HOT!and they didnt partake in any 
""extreme sports"".... so yea we are supposed to be  hanging out this weekend and I can't wait.

Me and Leann officially decided that when we look like circus freaks, we really get picked up on...

So John, Ky, Junior, Mike, Val, and Carlos came to where we were. Wow Carlos is seriously the finest thing I have ever seen, and it was really good to see the rest of them too, it had been forever since I had seen them. Well they all left except Los and me and him had a realy long talk. I think we covered everything. That boy, besides being the hottest thing I've ever seen in my life, is very insightful. He had alot of really good information... let me say that I DEFINATLEY understand guys alot more now.  but anyways ...

1. Friday we go to the game at Mira Mesa High School against Scripps Ranch..( yea thats right bitches DONS win Again... 27- 10 )...( Double header)...so we were at the feild from 4:20 to like 10:15... We Get A Call From Supa Johnny Boy, and he is gonna come visit us and get part of his birthday present. So he shows up... mind you that he has to be sumwhere else to pick up Crystall and Tommy... so anyways I can't leave  the feild cuz i have to do "" hydration  team "" ... anyways, so sUzie tells him to wait till half time which is like an hour and 20 minutes away.... so John buys a ticket and comes into the game to get tha gift.. and Suzie tells him that her money is in the car *cough* bulshit *cough* ... so pretty much Suzie tells him to leave and come back later, which wastes gas money, and it costs him $7 to get into the game..for nothing... so he calls and leaves a message & she gets mad ... and tells him to come get it at her house...
so0o0o I give Suzie my part of the gift and she puts it in an envelope so he can get it... seals the envelope, and sends him off... so all in all he had to drive all the Way to POWAY to get his gift and just to top it all off half of the gift was missing..

2. Johnny Got his Pimp Status Tat... yeah!... can't wait to see it!! ( but he was bleeding alot so he coudlnt get it finished completley until monday ) 

3. Saturday was Homecoming ... it was off the freaking chain .. had sooo much fun ... <u>SO MUCH FUN</u>.. much love to my gurls, had a blast with u guys. 

so0oo0oo0o here's when things get worse : 

4. Suzie Spends the night at mi casa after H.C ... We get waken up on Sunday morning by a fone call from Suzies mom... her mom said that the fire was gettting close & so they got evacutated, and she had to stay here because all the freeways were shut down. Anyways.. (her house is fine) but then we hear that the fire spread all the way to Clairemont and thats the home-town of the pimps.. so me and Suzie are sacred shitless we are watching the T.V.. and we call to make sure they are alright, but John doesnt answer, and I only could get ahold of Armando's G - ma ... but yea..they are alright cuz we got a call back from John. 

5. So we go to Church at 5, and Suzie gets a call from Elise's cell Dizzle, so she calls back after church ... Ky picks up and says "" hey .. blah blah blah, then makes the Rudest comment I have ever heard... "" well ur house is probally gone by now !"" .. and he was being totally serious, so Suzie starts Crying hands me the fone, and I tell Ky how fucked that was ... he gets mad calls back, and i do it again ... so the next time he calls Suzie blocks his call, and he leaves sum bullshit message... ""oh i didnt mean it badly my house is open""... so she is even more mad now!... cuz hes trying to kiss her ass!!!...  

7. Ky calls again this afternoon, trying to be all nice, and here's how they converstation went 
K : hey wats up? , are you o.k?... is your house o.k ??
S : umm, yes why are you being nice to me ??
K : Cuz ur Suzie!
S : wat the fuck, are you tyring to kiss my ass cuz ur so called Girlfreind is my best freind or do u really give a flying fuck ? yea think about that one buddy
K : WAT?
S : THINK ABOUT THAT ONE * click * ( she hangs up ) 

~ He calls back ~ 

K : hey, wat was that?
S : I told you to think about it Ky!!!!
K : Watever Suzie * Click ! * 

* p.s - its not called shit talking if its the truth ... the only thing ive said is that u were being a bitch, and that is the truth!...oh and Suzie talked to Brittani, and Brittani told her that she isnt ur girlfriend... also isnt that kinda weird to call sumone ur girlfreind if uve never even seen them ?!?! ... hmmm???\





 * well anyways that was a SHORT summary of this weekend... i know im leaving out alot of things probally but ... oh well * 
*much love and peace *"

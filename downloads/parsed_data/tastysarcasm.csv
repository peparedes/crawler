He won't say it. He says ""it's only waterweight"". Ad I'll lose it.

I'll never have a boyfriend.  want someone to massage my cramps. 

I also wish Ed woud get back online momentarily. 

I feel really unwelcome. But I know he  has his reasons to stay off.

I love Becca. Even though she won't lick my cat."

Sigh. (good sigh)

Again, I do not want to go to school tomorrow. Daniel's all horny on me. I'm so manipulative with my ex's.......eep.
 We just got home from The Italian Oven....I'm very satisfied.


I want Ian to call me. He didn't last night......

And why do I want guys that don't want me back?

And why do I corrupt the minds of guys that do want me?

Myke, if you read this if you get home tonight before you talk to me, was it bc you were at the hospital w/ Di? How did things go?

*hugs*  Feel better. *pets*

I really want Ian to call me....
I wanna be asian. 

Maybe the knucka will call me.

I miss Becca. I'm talking to Ed. I'm lookin at Penelope. 


I'm such a whore sometimes. I think I'm giving Ed a really hard time for no real reason, but then I see a reason when my feelings just got hurt, but over being pretty?

But I just honestly don't understand.......

Maybe you are being too hard on yourself. But remember just because I have a pretty face shouldn't mean you should overlook everything else about me.  This isn't exactly a problem I've always had to deal with. In fact, I think this is the first time I've had to have it enter my mind. I'm flattered you find me attractive. But that shouldn't pull you to or against me in any way. Because I think I have a lot to offer as a friend......

I really like ya. If we lived closer, I would most definitely date you. And it saddens me people like you are far away. At least, I haven't stumbled upon ""Ed""s anywhere else. I am lonely for all the ""Ed""s in the world."

Going to Waffle House is like a return to the mother's womb to me...

So I'm absolutely committment phobic now.....how bout that?

(And lonely as hell.....but comfortable? I'm whorish and have no energy to like anybody.......)

JERRI REVEALED!!!!

A fast talkin lotion salesman got me to pay twenty bucks to buy a bottle of lotion and a nail file and buffer. But it was all natural! He massaged my hands! Becca looked up at me with her big brown eyes. Huffs.

There went twenty. 

Then I went to Hot Topic to buy JTHM and a fairy poster. I picked out my fairy poster and it was awesome, and I picked the poster out of the tub that said ""23"", the number that corressponded with the number on the corner of the display. SOMEBODY put number 22 in number 23's crate, and I get home, open it to find a kitty fairy. Yes, a fiary with wings....

NOT NEARLY AS CUTE AS IT SOUNDS!

That one was about ten bucks. WHORE!!!!"

"event","I should honestly get a citation for the way I've been treating my good points lately. My conviction, morals, and good judgment have quite honestly turned into one big apathetic sex toy.

 However, as I've let myself slide, I've become pretty damn picky about the guys I wanna be with. I used to have a very open mind about the people I wanted to commit to, but since everything with Brent, Calen, and most recently, Travis, has happened, I scratch them off the list if they don't eat their Nutty Bars the right way. Sigh.

Quite exasperating.

There's a guy at school that's a definite potential. Just my luck, he's not as interested in me. 

Alas, when will it come? *slaps forehead daintily*

Or end, for that matter.

Ok, I'm hungry....

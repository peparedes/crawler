"event","<p>Long story short, my week of house sitting next week might be a week of babysitting then house sitting. Of fucking course. Kathy's boss had a stroke when we was on holidays I the sounds and because it took a while to get back into civilisation and get medical help has meant he's now in a coma and they aren't sure if he'll make it. Her boss also happens to be the father of Paul's boss' wife so both have had to cover at work so aren't sure if they can get the week off and go away or if they need to stay because of a funeral or what not. At least Kathy asked me if it was okay to head in regardless and to maybe stay extra if they don't get to leave for the Bach on Sunday but leave a few days later. But when my brother rung earlier in the week he made it sound so much more complicated and pretty much gathered I would go up regardless, no asking me if that was alright. That is what pisses me off. It's the not asking but just assuming or just organising what will happen then just tell us that we are expected to look after their children in the holidays. Asking gets you so much further. But if they don't go away I'm only looking after the kids for a week, if they want any longer they can pay for us to bus back down here. I'm not wasting my time in Chch to look after then.</p><p>It's a pain though if I don't get to just house sit. I had all my trips to the malls and other places I wanted to go to all sorted out, madmen plans with people to catch up, downloaded a fuckload of to shows (The Wire, Veronica Mars, Falling Skies), packed a pile of DVDs (Star Wars trilogy, Day of the Darleks, Firefly) and books (Harry potter and the Goblet of Fire, The First Casualty, Room, plus all my iBooks library on my iPad) to watch and read while I'm up there seeing as I won't be able to download anything up when I'm up (How can I live that without seeing the final of Sherlock on Monday or miss 2 weeks of shows! My download schedule will be mammoth when I get back). I had it all planned and I was really looking forward to being on my own in Chch for a week. But now it could all be cancelled. All the window shopping may not get done *sign*. Nothing my brother says or plans ever works out. </p><p>Haven't done much this week. Went out to Maggie's place on Tuesday while mum and dad were out in Temuka for a bit. Today I went to lunch with <LJ user=""artic_fox""> drive around the Scenic/Country roads and Point area for the last time because she flys out back to London! not to be seen again to who knows when. Then I cam home and procrastinated in packing but finally packed the bag. Think I have more food than anything in there seeing as there is not proper food in their house. I'm all for healthy eating but there is only so much celery or carrots a girl can eat. Tomorrow Maggie and Sarah are suppose to be coming in but Sarah will pull her usual tricks but hopefully they come in for a coffee. Other than that my week has been spent watching Jericho. God I forgot how much I loved that show! Finally good to see the end of the show (which makes the comics make more sense now). I had watch about the first half of season 1 then went to the states for Camp and because back then there wasn't so many options for recording or online watching etc I never got to watch the rest or season 1 and season 2 never screened here. Skeet Ulrich really deserves a better career than he's had!</p><p>Anyhow I'm just procrastinating from reading more the <i>Mad About the Boy</i>. This book is torture to read. if you are a Bridget jones fans! it's probably a good idea to not read it. Even if Mark Darcy wasn't killed off, I don't think he would even save this book! </p>"

"event","So Christmas and New Year have come and gone to very little fan fare. For Christmas We (parents, sister and I) went up to Chch to stay for 5 days with my brother, sister-in-law and nephews. Most of the time was spent playing with my nephews and off course the Doctor Who Christmas Special (OMG THE FEELS! - Basically it was a crap episode and the world's weirdest/shortest regeneration and not the great way Matt deserved to go but then that's nothing unusual for the story lines he has had in his time. But it was fun watching for all the easter eggs and the glimpse of Capaldi! I did enjoy the cameo of Amy (and the terrible wig made from her own hair) and Amilea. Am excited to see Who goes from here). Presents wise I got quiet a good haul. Lots of nerdy gifts :P Mum and Dad went nuts on me randomly.

Although my sister has become a spoilt brat and complained that her wall art was only of shots that were of New York if you had been there blah de blah so I gave her the one with the words on it. I'm sorry I talked mum into getting the set for us and splitting it so I took the ones that match my other wall arts plus I liked the one that said New York. You are lucky you were getting any. Mum felt bad cause it was the only thing on your list you weren't getting. Ungrateful brat. This also came on the day when all she did was bitch about how she has got no sleep since we arrived because I coughed and sleep talk (My whole life she is the only person to tell me I sleep talk) too much so I gave her another Christmas present and slept on the couch. When everyone woke up Boxing day they all told her off for behaving like a spoilt brat and she claimed she never asked me to. Everyone just rebuffed her by saying that they didn't blame me after all the snide remarks she had said all day. But I'm the shellfish spoilt brat.

Did manage a super quick visit to Riccarton Mall on Boxing day but didn't buy anything other than some onsies to put into my basket for Maggie. We got Saturday and I haven't really done anything in the few days I've been back.

Am catching up with Stacey and Lynsey tomorrow before they head but to London in the next wee bit. But other than that I have no upcoming plans other than house sitting for Paul and Kathy cause they are heading down to the lakes with the twins. I'm actually begin nice and doing it this time as the idea of being in Chch with an entire house to myself for a week sounds AMAZING! I'm looking forward to shopping in the malls, playing the wii and just having freedom that comes from not being around the parents and in a city that has a decent amount of life in it! Sadly I have around 10 days to wait till I head up. Kathy said she book my ticket up there and back so we'll see if that happens otherwise I guess I will have to pay.

Right time to stop re-watching Sherlock and curl up in bed and read. Ciao."

"event","<p>Well New Years brought me... Tears. Wonderful but I guess that is expected when you have no one to celebrate it with. I didn't even get a pity invite to any celebrations. I know that it is one of the most over-rated days, second only to valentines day, but I just can't help but want to celebrate it, do all those cool things people do to see the new year in but it always ends up being a very lonely night. This year just seems to heighten the loneliness. Christmas is a day for families and New Years is a day for friends. I'm used to Christmas being shit with my family, they always let me down and vice versa but its the day for going out and hanging with friends but it always ends up either being alone, the pity invite or I'm just the girl on the outskirts looking in, never been really incorporated. </p><p>It doesn't help that lately I've been realising how little I fit into the lives of any of my close friends anymore. I don't have a hubby and children so I get shunned by those friends who do and forgotten about. I don't live in an awesome place with a cool social life or anything like that so don't really get a look in by those friends that do.</p><p>I don't fit into any of their worlds anymore and I feel like the hanger-on who tires and tries and tries but am never really part of any world I am trying to fit into. I feel like I'm the friend people have because they don't know how to get rid of me. Old friends are hard to cut off. But the drifting away from them one by one, year by year is slowly killing me and certainly driving me insane.</p><p>I'm the loner. I grew up alone with no one ever at home. The girl that moved every year or so so never kept any friends. The girl forced to keep everyone at arms length because it made the enviable easier to deal with. The loneliness it just so hard. Why is life just skipping me by.</p><p>What is about me that makes people exclude me? I really wish someone would just grow some balls and tell me. I can't change unless I know what the problem is. It's obviously something.</p><p> Then there's this other friend who is fighting so hard to tell me how much our friendship means to her just about every time we talk. I feel like she is trying to convince herself not me. She seems like she's trying to refuse to accept that our friendship is drifting apart. At least she's fighting as much as I am but should a friendship be like this after almost 18 years?</p><p>I'm just making my head go around in circles now. Also I'm starting to to make sense to myself. I'll update about Christmas and Chch in the morning when hopefully I'm in a slightly better mood. It's almost 3, I better get some sleep. Think I might need it.</p>"

Anyhoo I forgot to write in my last entry that we got out marks back. Not really happy with my results but not much I can do about it. So I got:

Employment Relations: 84.3% A
Commerical Law: 82.7% A
Business Computing: 69.5% B+

Pissed off cause I no longer have a straight A average. Stupid thing is I got an A, A+, A for 3 or the 4 assignments for computing but still end up with a B+! So right up to the end they paper has been fucking everyone around. Also surpised I only got As for Law and ER! I was 0.7% off a A+ for ER. So close! but Law seriously I really expected an A+ for Law. Don't know where I went wrong in the end but they are not marks that are good enough. Happy that even after all the tears and rants and raves I got 92% for my database assignment and the exam I got 82%. ER assignment 3 I got 82% and the exam I got 89%. Law exam I got 72%."

"event","I know it's been ages since I updated this. It was an insane month finishing up clases and exams and the mess of a computing class just got worse and worse and who know what my grades will be when we get them back next week. I went into the Law exam with 61 so I've passed, it's just a matter of wheter it is with an A or a A+. Employment Relations I was on 49.97 so I think with the assignment and exam I should get either and A or A+. Computing I got a D for excel *rolls eyes* don't get me started ont eh shambles of THAT! Only 3 people from both campuses passed and they still wonder why we are complaing about the paper? The Access Database assignment was bollocks too, we had only been taught a fraction of what we needed to be and we had to create an entire database whereas previous years they just had to edit it. I don't why they thought it would be a good idead to have 3 tutors for one bloody paper and that they could get away with poor organising for it when thye had made it so much harder. Hopefully I've passed the Database and they theory exam to hopefullky passed and maybe even get a B. I hate it when you can get A's in all the assessments bar 1 but still not get an A. But ast least I have completed the Human Resources compoments so I can graduate with the Applied level 5 diploma in the feb ceremony. Finally got around to off my application for the New Zealand Istitute of Management Diploma too. $210 later... I don't see why it would take $35 per paper for a company to look up whether I have actually done the papers I said I have especially when I had to provide a copy of my student transcript with my application form. Waste of money but it's a second diploma I guess. Anyhoo, just 3 more papers in semester 1 next year and I have finished my NZ Diploma in Business. Marks are out next Friday tho. 

Bugger is that it's a hell of a smestrer - Taxation, Economics and Accounting Principles. Fun times for the non-number loving me. It will be a hard semester especially as my classes are 3 in a row AGAIN! Seriously every semester I had 3 in a row. At least it's day times and not night time!

Other than tech, really haven't been up to much... Went up to Chch a few weekends ago to pick my sister up from her around-the-world 40th trip and wnet and hung witht the nephews for the day as it was a few days before thier birthday. How those little boys became big 8 year olds! Oh and Maggie is expecting twin boys. Fun two more friggin boys to buy for. When will there be a little girl for me to buy stuff for?

My poor mac is very sick :( The left fan has been mulfunctioning for a while but now it's at the point where after about 10 minutes it starts sounding like it's trying to fly or something. Such a loud buzzing noise. So I'm currently making suare everything is back upa dn download a weeks worth of stuff to watch and dump it on my ipad so that I can send it up to Auckaland to get fixed. How can I last without my poor baby :( I'm trying to use it as little as possible so I'm currently on my old shitty bearing working 5 year old windows laptop. Hopefully I won't go to insane while it gets fixed or it won't take to long.

Have Strassman on Saturday so that should be a good show. Otherwise nothing else on the plans at all for the summer except job hunting to no avail and hinding from this cold cold weather.

And yes, last weekend. Doctor Who. I still can't say much else other than WOW and Ten and Eleven. Together. Agh! Bad Wolf = AMAZING. TOM BAKER at the end = SO MANY FANGIRL FEELS! Easily of of my favourite episodes ever. I had a hell of a lot of fun watching all the documentires et all that were on and I still have the whole 10 episodes of the Mosnter and VIllans to watch and some of the ultimate still to watch. the Five(ish) Doctors Reboot was awesome. Those were the doctors of my childhood. Loved how they were getting the credit that was due to them from the current Whodom who like to think that the reboot series is the be end and end all of the series (these are also the ones saying they will stop watching because Peter is to old and not hot enough, i.e. not the real fans). It's the whole 50 years people, all of it that makes it so great. Anyway, less than a month and it's the Christams episode which of course I am excited about and am in complete denial that it's Matt's last hurah. I know I'll love Peter just like I did when Matt first started. But I'm just not ready to go through tha pain of losing a beloved doctor again. I also loved wearing my tardis earrings and necklace! I have this <a href=""http://www.weeklyshirts.com/10th-Quotes/94dab6"">Ten t-shirt</a> and <a href=""http://www.weeklyshirts.com/11th-Quotes/1121cf"">Eleven t-shirt</a> (cause I couldn't decide which one to get) and the Her Universe <a href=""http://www.heruniverse.com/tardis-a-line-dress.html"">Tardis dress</a> but I got it through <a href=""http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Girls/Cosplay/Doctor+Who+Her+Universe+TARDIS+Costume+Dress-10056664.jsp"">Hot Topic</a> cuase it was $10 cheaper then they had 25% off. Shipping was a bitch though. 

And completley unrellated I so want Her Universe's <a href=""http://www.heruniverse.com/brands/star-wars/vader-a-line-dress.html"">Darth Vader Dress</a>.Oh and <a href=""http://www.planetrawr.co.nz/collections/all"">Planet Rawr</a> has a whole lot of new awesome jewllery on her site. Want so many things from her it's not funny. Have so much already though. Thinkign of getting the Wonder Woman W custom made by her to match my cool new iPhone case :P Speaking of nerdy/geeky things to buy, I need to get cracking on finding something for my twitter #nzsecretsanta present.

Really don't think there is anything else to ramble about. Really should start list crap to sell on trademe or reading some more of the economics books I got out of the library that are week issues. I'm such a nerd that I've started reading books for next semester 9 or just smart enough to know I'm lazy/will lack motivation later on in the summer to do it)?

Anyhoo, till next time!

ETA: Happy Birthday <lj user=""artic_fox"">! Hope you had a great day and the start to the dreaded thirties wasn't all bad! (you'll get your pressent when you come home. Sorry I was too stingy to post it this year lol :P)

Also new journal layout. Dunno if I like it but it will do for know."

"event","So seeing as I randomly gotten a few new adds that I just added back I thought I would do one of those welcome blah-de-blah posts that sums me up :P

<lj-cut text=""Introduction"">So welcome to the newbies! I'm Julie, an in denial 29 year old who is refusing  that her 20s are over in all but a few months. Although I look, act and probably should be a lot younger than that. I'm currently a business student (which is ridiculously my 5th tertiary qualification!). I was born in South Africa, moved to New Zealand when I was 4, grew up all around NZ until my parents ended up stupidly staying in Timaru for High School so I guess it's the closet thing to a Hometown I have. Went to Uni at Canterbury then did the whole summer camp counsellor thing in New Jersey before moving to London for my big OE then came back to NZ where I have been <strike>stuck</strike> back here 3 years looking for my way outta the country again. I'm into anything nerdy/tv/movie/pop culture related. Well actually into pretty much most things but you'll figure that out as you read this. Love to travel and feel like the further away from home I am the more at ease and the happier I am. Dreams of finding a way to live overseas for the rest of my life. I've had some form of a lj since I was 16 so I'm to friggin loyal to this thing to give now.

<b><u>Frequent mentions:</b></u>

<b>My parents:</b> Pretty self-explanatory. I living with them atm (argh). Retired ministers who think I am the devil child and am a complete failure and waste or space (more my father's view than my mothers). Had me accidentally when they were in their mid-40s a decade after they stopped having kids. Have spent my life reminding me of this and how much I was unwanted. Are stuck in a loveless marriage they can't get out of because God say it's a no-no. 

<b>Paul:</b> My eldest brother. Is the greatest gift on earth and can do no wrong. The perfect child who the rest of us have no chance of ever living up to the same greatness. Best dad in the world and it's all mine, my sister and parents fault that his children aren't perfect.

<b>Kathy:</b> My mostly awesome sister-in-law who was crazy enough to marry Paul. Does need to learn how to spend more time with her child than her career or coming up with ways to dump them onto my family. She think her family is so much better than mine despite the fact no one in her family make any effort to spend time with her or my nephews and never visit them in Chch.

<b>Caleb and Josh:</b> My adorable twin nephews who are 7 going on 20. I'm sneakingly turning them into miniature nerds. So far have managed to get them into Star Wars. Latest attempt was to turn them into Whovians. They think I'm the best Aunty cause I have an iPad, iPhone and ""like lots of boys stuff even though you're a girl"". Which is helping me to teaching them to not be sexist bastards like their father is.

<b>John:</b> My older brother. The rich prick who lives in London. Has decided to completely cut himself off from the family but yet expect us to shower him with affection on his birthday and christmas.

<b>Tracey:</b> My older sister. Lives her in Timaru as well. Have a love-hate relationship with each other. At the moment we are very affectionate towards each other.

<b>Maggie:</b> My best friend since Form 2. We are polar opposites in many ways but so alike in many others. Have a freakishly close bond to the point where we can think the same thing and will frequently contact each other at the same about the same thing. Is more like my sister than my sister has ever been. My parents were forced to treat her like a fifth child because I was the only one left at home.

<b>Stacey:</b> Otherwise known as <lj user=""artic_fox"">. Is basically another version of me, expect a hell of a lot more smarter and hotter! Everything I am into she happens to be into. We watch, read and agree on just about everything but when we disagree it's passionately :P Have been friends since 5th form and went to the same uni and we even moved to the other side of the world together and flatted in London for a year. Best travel companion EVER. Is living the life I wish I had. 

There are other frequently mentions but I can't think of any and I'm bored with this now cause it's making me realise how cynical I sound. You'll soon figure that I have a pretty messed up family and being stuck back in NZ near has really heightened that fact.
</lj-cut>

In other news, my test on Wednesday was just horrible as I expected it to be. Probably did half of it and not confident that I got that 1/2 right. I really think I am looking at my first paper where i won't be getting an A as a final grade. DAMNIT! I highly doubt I will get full marks for the assignment and exam so I'm screwed. Have mock negotiations for Employment Relations to work on over the weekend. I hate group projects I'm over them. I also have a group law assignment also. 

Had coffee with Maggie today after tutorials. Was nice to see her as it's been ages cause Sarah has grown bored with bringing into town on Fridays but she will begin again soon once she hears Maggie's news that she pregnant again and with twins this time. Spent money I don't have on a red lace dress from Pagani for $20 and some new sand OPI nail polish cause it was 3 for 2 at Farmers.

Anyways getting headachy again so gonna go have some pain killers and a cuppa tea while watching XFactor and the new White Collar. HELLO MAT BOMBER! It's wonderfull to have your hotness gracing my TV screen once again!"

"event","I hate useless tutors, I hate useless tests, I hate excel, I hate tests with no instructions.

I have a 25% test tomorrow on Excel and I will be lucky to get even a few marks. Doesn't help I've been feeling sick and achy the last few nights. But yeah going to completely flunk this test. Out tutor is rubbish and is one of those that tell you what we are going to do today then tells us to do, doesn't really explain it. He's one of those she'll be right people and being the perfectionist I am I need to know why an how. It is no point telling to add a data validation to a spreadsheet but WHY do we use one so I can know WHEN to use one. Especially as that is out test. We have a list of things we need to know how to use but no instructions as to when to use them and on what task. Yip it will be 1.45 hours of shit and that's the other thing it's not the full 2 hours we are meant to have! If it's anything like the word test we had it will be a 2 hour exam that we have to do in 1.45! It's like the word test and that it is written by one person but marked by another. The one marking it is also the tutor known for having the lowest marks in his classes. I just have to hope I get good enough marks in the assignment and end of year exam we have left to get a decent grade overall.

So over this computing class! Just one more friggin month left. It is seriously the biggest mess of a class. Watch out the end-of-year student feedback focus group, I'm going to let rip! At least the other papers are going well. Finally got Assignment 1(b) back for Employment Relations and got 12.87/15 for it. 

I really should be studying but every time I try to I just can't. I know it will be a disaster so why waste my time studying on things that I am never going to understanding until I have a better teacher. SO why bother and I can barely move without getting a chill, nauseous or dizzy or a combination of the 3. Anyone have any last-minute excel tips? (apart from the obvious of never getting a job where I have to do one). Anyway I've given up for the night and just gonna watch TV. I missed all my shows last night cause as soon as I got home from class I went to bed for 14 hours and barely slept any of that time as I was to busy freezing to death or boiling to death or waking up in my own sweat. I really hope I not coming down with something really bad.

Anyhoo haven't down much the last 2 weeks of the holidays. My nephews came down for a week. Same old same old of course. They stayed longer than my sister-in-law said they would be here, brother demanded where we had to take them (like swimming and when told we were going to take them, they got so upset cause they didn't want to go), they don't eat anything sister-in-law said they ate, and the clincher - they only skyped ONCE in the entire 8 days they were down here. But they did skype the second time when they knew mum and I had taken them to Smurfs 2 so weren't home and they knew it was safe to just tell dad that they were not coming down the next day to collect them cause he's the soft one who doesn't judge them for being bad parents. Oh yeah and I'm to blame for their failing writing at school cause I let them play on my iPad to much! AH WHAT? The one week every 10/11 weeks that I actually see them and let them play game son my iPad is the reason they are failing English? What about the 11 weeks you have then and never help them with their homework, never test them on their words or never get them to draw to build up their motor skill muscles? Nope, It's my fault, how stupid of me to think otherwise.

Anyway I can't stop shivering which is making me ache like a motherfucker so I'm going to go and add a million layers and hop into bed to warm myself up."

"event","Last week of holidays and head back to tech tomorrow. Horrible schedule this semester though:
Commercial Law 1:00-2:45pm
Business Computing 3:00-4:45pm
Employment Relations 5:30-7:15pm.
It just makes me cringe. Then I have to walk home in the DARK AND COLD for 45 mins!

Pretty much done nothing this week. Just the usual. Although this weekend has pretty much been me geeking out over the NerdHQ live streaming of all their Comic-Con panels. This years panels are EPIC! Zac Levi even managed to get Nathan Fillion to host a few of them. The mystery panel one was AMAZING - Zachary Levi Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, and Rob Kazinsky! Agh so much Chuck/Castle/Firefly geek-out feels! Also the Zac panel by himself was amazing too. Just finished watching the Dr Who which was again amazing! Desperate to watch the Orphan Black, Joss Whedon, Hannibal (Hello Hugh Dancy) and Sherlock ones and so many more. I'm going to be watching them all week :P Oh and the epic pinnacle of the NerdHQ this weekend is the open-air screening of Serenity at the Padres Stadium (Um hello Firefly <u>AND</u> Baseball, together!) - What I would give to have been there. Every year it just gets more and more epic and of course raises so much more money for <a href=""http://www.operationsmile.org"">Operation Smile</a> and it just makes me want to go so badly every year. Seriously someone needs to clone Zac so I can marry him. And as usual is always makes me go on a Zac Levi craze and must watch him in stuff (yes even though I only just have a Zac Levi craze a few weeks ago and watched Chuck) resulted in my watching a documentary he narrated on the history of Monopoly. Yes you read that right and shut up it was really, really interesting. Best documentary I've seen in a while and discovered that NZ not only has a National Championship but the reigning champion went to the 2009 World Championship and got second????? What the?

Reminds me I need to watch Zac on Jay Leno from this week.

Anyway had Maggie's b-day lunch for her 30th today which turned into all afternoon and early evening but had a fun time. We went out to the Shearers Quarters then C-Bay. 

Also the nephews arrived yesterday for the week. Those little boys and spurted in the last few months!

Anyhoo, I really should go and try and get an early night like before 4am after I watch a few more NerdHQ videos."

"event","Last week was boring as fuck. Mostly just marathoning TV shows (re-watched Castle and Sex and the City) and movies. And that will probably be the aim for this week (Luther and Breaking Bad). Barely left my bed or my room. Just seem to have no energy to do anything except sleep and watch stuff and read.

Did venture out last Friday to polytech to get my final assignments and exams results back. HRM assignment 3 I got 74% and  for the exam I got 73%, O&M Exam 61%, RSA Report 76% and evaluation 88.5%. Leaving me with the overall grades of:
Human Resources: 82% A
Applied Management: 81% A
Organisation & Management: 82% A

Surprised to not get an A+ for O&M but stoked with Applied Management which almost makes up for having to deal with all the RSA crap. 

Currently I am watching what feels like the most boring movie (<i>The Escapist</i>) which is a shame considering it starts Damian Lewis and Dominic Cooper and it a British production. But I am over 100 films watched this year! Sadly though my reading challenge this year has gone the wayside. I really need to get into reading again. Just wish I had more time to do it or make more use of holidays to read it.

Brother has informed us that we will have the nephews the second week of the holidays which is conveniently the first week back. So I get out of looking after them :D Poor mum will have to do it alone and hopefully that will make her say no next time and my brother and sister-in-law can get a reality check. But yeah about 10 days left till Semester 2 begins!

Mum and dad got the new ariel put up on Monday so I have TV again :D. Although the Igloo box won't connect to the net damnit :|.

Nothing else really to report. Life is totally boring. I need adventure!"

"event","I know it's been an eternity since I last updated but my god was this last month of tech was INSANELY busy and  top top it all off I was sick with the flu for the week around Queen's Birthday. Had so much due and exams and argh, just no time or motivation for anything else. But everything got handed in on time including the horrible group report and presentation. The presentation was good. Poor Josh had to do it on no sleep after his wife had their baby 4 hours earlier but he didn't want to postpone it. The RSA wasn't happy though and went a bit nuts but we oh well the presentation or over, the report is in and they can't do anything about it and can ignore what we have done and we will still get a grade. Exams went ok too. Organisation & Management one was so easy I left over an hour early and had answered every single question. So either I completely aced it or flunked it. Human Resource was a lot tougher and a LOT more writing. SO MUCH WRITING! My poor hand was so sore. Now it's the wait to find our my marks and final grades. I got 97% for the last O&M assignment so I went in that exam sitting on 64% out of the 72% already allocated so have passed regardless of the exam result but fairly confident I should get an A+ for the paper. HRM I'm siting on 40% out of the 50% allocated so that's another A hopefully. Applied Management is the one I'm worried about though. I'm sitting on 17/20 of the allocated but the bloody group presentation and report and the evaluation can go either way. Surely we will get a decent grade cause we worked SO HARD and had so many obstacles and had huge issues and we still managed to get a 69 page report done and I had spent an entire weekend going through it all to make sure it covered everything we had to and there were no mistakes and I will loose the plot if we don't get an A. I was s stressed and was loosing my mind over that damn report.

Sorry just had to rant over this semester. It was such a hard one and was such a heavy workload. Next semester will be a breeze :P I'm doing Commercial Law, Business Computing and Employment Relations. Downside is they are 3 in a row 1pm - 7.15pm! LONG DAY! Anyway I have three weeks off and I have (as long as I pass this semester) completed 1 out 3 diplomas I'm doing! YAY! (Technically have enough credit for 2 diplomas but I haven't done one required paper for the second one).

Must remember to ring WINZ today. They have me set to stop studying this semester so my allowance is about to end but I'm not finishing up and am continuing for another semester so need to ring and see if I can extend the date or have to re-apply again. Why are they always so complicated?

Argh my left shift button has randomly stopped working and it's driving me nuts.

Done lots of watching stuff too, while doing study of course lol. I marathon-ed Chuck while I was sick and stuck in bed for a week. I really do love that show with all my heart. It's wired to think it only ended last year, feels like it was an eternity since it ended :(. But re-watching all the TV rips files I had were shit quality and inspired me to finally bite the bullet and buy the boxed set which arrived last week (brought from Amazon UK cause it's not avaliable in NZ). So of course that meant I just had to rip all the episodes and bonus features to replace the TVrips so that is what I have been doing since my last exam on Monday. Plus had to re-read the Chuck comic too. I'm such a nerd lol.

Also just finished marathoning The Big Bang Theory last night and am now onto to Castle. I am running out of shows to re-watch. So think I need to start downloading some new shows. Downloaded and watched The Mindy Project the other week but am thinking of doing How I Met Your Mother (but argh downloading all of the season just seems likes such a mission), Parenthood, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Workaholics, or Broadwalk Empire. Don't know where to start or what ones I actually want to watch. Also feel like re-watching Sex and the City as well.

Only other thing that has happened lately was the Bookarama. I went on first day at 9am and within in 5 minutes I had 2 bags full of books. Finally got a copy of <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest</i> and the last 3 Harry Potter books along with a whole lot of other books. Think a lot of my 3 weeks off will be spent reading, reading and reading :D. I also picked up a couple of management books for $1 each so hopefully they will come in handy.

Right I don't think there is anything else I can bore you to death with. I'm amazed if you are still reading this!"

"event","What a couple of busy weeks! Assignment, focus groups and group meetings coming out of my ears. The guys of end of semester I guess.

Got my RSA group proposal results: 25.1/30 for the group part and individual self-reflection part: 10/10 for a total of 35.1/40. Also 40.75/50 A for Human Resources.

Marathoned the entire 7 seasons of Gilmore Girls in the last week or so. I really hadn't realised how much I missed that show. Forgot how shit the last two seasons were though and how stupid the Logan and April characters and their story lines were! Not to mention Christopher (esp season 6 & 7!) Although it's funny watching it now. Rory was only a year younger than me when the show first aired so when I first watched I was so into her story lines and she was my fav character (and she still is) and of course totally shipped Rory & Jess. This time round I found myself loving Lorelei and her storyline more than before and shipping Her and Luke. Man I must be growing up! It's also interesting how many people guest stared in it like Abed from Community, Sam from Smash, and Bay from Separated at Birth (as stupid April) that I just never paid any attention to but do now lol. It's also the seeing all the dated stuff like VHS tapes, cellphones that can barely text and the many references to Dial Up or ADSL internet being install (When did we start calling it broadband and stop calling is ADSL?) or random social references from that era. Love the old school-ness

Anyways, that was really pointless random spiel about GG! This weeks show marathon is Chuck. Not having a TV is making me marathon a lot of shows. I will no doubt run out of shows soon. At least Rookie Blue and Offspring have started back up so there is some shows to download at watch.

Not much else to report. 

Kayleigh and I have been discussing our camp reunion and US travels for next year. We are looking at
<a href=""http://www.trekamerica.com/tours/tn.html"">Trailblazer</a> or <a href=""http://www.trekamerica.com/tours/gn.html"">Grand Trek</a> as tours we want to do. Man I need lots of money! I've been to most of the places they go but Kay hasn't so it's really up to her which one we go on. As long as we can go to Yellowstone and Mt. Rushmore, I'll be happy. Would be nice to go back to the Grand Canyon, Canadian Rockies and Vegas. We are going to start and end in NYC. Hopefully if money permits I can sneak a stop in London to see people there then Kay and I can fly over together seeing as she is terrified of flying. Am I good friend or what. But that's more money but maybe I can get a RTW ticket. Ah well see I guess.

Right gonna curl up in bed at watch or read something."

"event","It's been a while. But basically, the nephews came and went. Weren't that badly behaved and were Little Mr Independents this time round. Sis-inlaw sent then down with only 1 pair of pyjamas each. Caleb's pair had a big hole in them which he put his foot through the first night. Nice one. So we had to go out and buy new pjs the next day and off course cause Caleb was getting a pair Josh had to. Well played Kathy, Well played! That's a new way to con your mother-in-law to buy YOUR children new pjs. Especially seeing as you had the entire week they were here off. WHAT WAS THE POINT OF SENDING THEM DOWN! If you were able to look after them? Mum and Dad agreed to have them for part of each holiday so that my brother and sister-in-law didn't waste their annual leave on staying at home. Then she takes a week off when she is already kid free? Really taking the mickey now! Good thing at least is mum is starting to see Paul and Kathy for the gold diggers they are. 

So that was the shit end to he holidays and have been back a week at Polytech. Got my O&M assignment back and got an A. Why does saying I got an A or 16.6/20 sound so much better than saying I got 83%? It's the same with HRM which I also got an A or 11.5/15 but in an % it's only 75%. But seems like a few people in class failed so I shouldn't sound ungrateful but 75% is pretty low for me. I also got asked to be the student rep for the Business School for the year so that's cool I guess. Had an intro meeting  this week and will be having a meeting with the Departmental Heads once a term.

With the digital switchover and the student Timaru ariel pointing the wrong way I can't get any digital TV so have had a lot of downloading to do but with all the winter shows finishing up in the states there is not a lot to watch. At least I've caught up with my movies. Finally found a copy of <i>Remember Sunday</i>. SUCH A CUTE MOVIE Y'ALL! Alexis Bledel and Zachary Levi in a movie, together - WHTA IS THERE NOT TO LOVE! I watched like 10 time sin one week. Made me realise how much I missed Alexis Bledel and <i>Gilmore Girls</i> so have downloaded the entire 7 seasons to do a re-watch marathon! Also gonna re-watch <i>Chuck</i> cause Zachary Levi is just a pure god. 

Also watched the documentary <i>Craiglist Joe</i> which I recommend as a good watch. Interesting to see how far someone can go on the generosity of strangers. We need craigslist in New Zealand!

TV3 needs to get an app like TVNZ to make it easier for me to watch shows on my iPad. Better yet if they get it so I can watch them through apple TV would be even better!

Have Applied Management class tomorrow. Hate Saturday classes but only tomorrow and on other to go. The group project is going okay. The RSA had an open public meeting on Tuesday. What an interesting insight. Terribly run, too many old men yelling at each other, no one listening, everyone yelling and disrespecting everyone. They have till December to try and fix their financial issues before they go bust. Getting annoyed with one of the team members though. She is the ""co-ordinator"" who has gone and written our executive summary for the report. 1) Her and I were suppose to do this TOGETHER (she did this for the proposal too, wrote my part). 2) The executive summary is suppose to be written last and it's the conclusion that goes int eh front of a business report. We can't write it till we know WHAT we have researched and concluded and come up with suggestions. How can you write about that when we haven't done it? She has just gone and taken over everything and pretty much made all the decision on everything without even asking us and she's done everything I am meant too. So pissed! Our group meeting during class will be interesting cause I'm sure the others will not be impressed.

Right should stop procrastinating from my assignment. Managed to procrastinate yesterday and most of today. This O&M assignment is crap. Absolute crap. At least she gave the class a week extension on it so it's due on the 22 not the 15. She was only giving us a week for it and she hadn't even taught us anything we need to know for the assignment!"

"event","Seriously SO BORED now! Managed to actually do some backing up of my hard drives yesterday which I have been meaning to do for ages but it's such a slow, boring and time consuming thing I procrastinate with.  And with that my highlight of my week. 

I had a group meeting for the RSA thing today. Rachel has some surgeries that she has to get done sometime over the next week weeks/months. The poor thing. It's preventative but still bit scary and she was all worried about our group being let down by her. I think her health should come first and we can do the bulk of the work and she can contribute as much as she feel she is able to do. We got our 40 copies of the questionnaires to fill out. Not sure if I know 40 people in Timaru let alone 40 who will fill in a 3 page survey for me. put we have a huge lot back from our surveys we left at the RSA so we have plenty of internal stakeholders views, just gotta get these external ones filled out. Then we can start getting the report written and prezi for the next stage done. 

After that went into town for some shopping. It must be winter. The shops are full of boring clothes. At least red is on trend and purple so there is at least colour int he shops

Anzac Day tomorrow. Planing on going to the Dawn Service as usual. Will also be going to the 10am one and the RSA afterwards. Have to do personal observations, hopefully will see other group members there. We decided to do our own thing for it seeing as we are all coming and going and Charlie being a territorial, has to do army stuff for the day.

Such a boring post I know but I again just needed to do <i>something</i>.

The itchy feet feeling is just not going away. I mentioned last entry about the Camp reunion we had planned well I'm thinking or possibly doing the 12-month recent graduate visa the USA have. Just discovered it doesn't have an age limit! As long as you have completed your first year or graduated within the last 12 months and hold a kiwi (or aus) passport. Really tempted to do that next year. It's open all year round so can go whenever. Depending on money I could go for all of 2014 and not do the last semester or go at the end of semester 1 next year. I won't bother doing the graduation ceremony as I've been there done that. I might even be able to go back to Camp to work :D. Then after that head up to Canada to do their work visas as they are till 35 and it doesn't matter about the student/graduate status. I just need to live overseas again. That's when life makes sense for me. I just need to live in the states again. I really feel like I should have been born a yank or a pom and not a kiwi.

It might also give me the kick on the pants to pay these debts off and get a job, any job. Stop procrastinating and find one. Including full-time ones that could get me the money I need.Of course the parents will dislike this and go on about how all I spend my money on is travelling and living overseas and that I need to seattle down etc etc. Oh whatever. 

This is all dependent on paying off the money I owe on the credit card, my brother and my fees from mum and dad. Then save up enough money to get there and stuff. Jesus, I need to win the bloody lottery.

This or course means getting a job which don't exist in Timaru for me. God dammit! This isn't going to happen I can see it.

So sick of my dreams never coming true. So sick of always having to settle for less. So sick of not being able to just move to another country permanently forever. Everyone else seems to make it seems so easy - to get a job, to get money, to seattle down, to move overseas permanently. Luck seems to smile on everyone else but me. It's like fate/powers that be said grant her 3 wishes (degree, camp and OE to London) and that's it no more. 

I just keep hoping and waiting for my luck to change but it never has, once in the last 3 years. I'm just over this god damn town, country and life. Seriously, never struggle setting up a life for myself any other place or country I live but here - 3 years later and I'm still stuck here, in the exact same spot. Just so totally over it.

Gee the things I think about when I have nothing to do and have plenty of spare time.

ETA: Why are my gifs not uploading for userpics? Have some Skylar Astin ones I want to add but they aren't working :(. I have now watched pretty much everything he has been in that I can get my hands on. Need more Skylar!"

"event","I don't think i have ever been so bored in my life. There is just nothing to do. The internet is boring as hell and I'm over watching movies or TV shows or reading. There is only so much of that I can do.

I need to get out of the house and do something. I need some to keep me busy. It's only the start of the holidays and I'm already counting down to the end of them. At least I have a team meeting on Wednesday so that gives me something to do and then Anzac Day there is the dawn service and my team are going to the RSA afterwards to hand out questionnaires and talk to people I think so that gets two days doing stuff. But seriously i can't take this sitting around doing nothing. I need to get out of this place and do something.

I don't know if it's just a I need to get out of Timaru or out of NZ but I have itchy feet. I just wish I could fast forward to this time next year, add a minor miracle on the money/job front, and be gearing up for the USA/Camp reunion trip. I need another grand adventure. I'm over this seattle life now. Been back here nearly 3 years. I need to live overseas again. I need to feel like I'm doing something other than just going through the motions.

Really don't know why I'm updating this or the point of this entry. I'm just really restless and bored."

"event","So I'm officially on holidays for the next two weeks and a bit. I handed in everything that was due this week by Monday and had my last class yesterday and down't have any assignments to do over the break so only the RSA group stuff to worry about.

Last weekend was the presentation for the RSA group proposal. Our tutor said our group was the best and that we had a real in-depth written and oral proposal and it was noticeable that we were the only group that had practiced. So that's good feedback. She couldn't believe how much we had done already and that we had surveys already out at the RSA bars etc. If you want to read the prezi we did for the presentation you can do so <a href=""http://prezi.com/npm-uirufg38/untitled-prezi/"">here</a>. Don't have our marks back but it sounds promising. Got my HR assignment back and got 82% for it so that's 8.2 marks towards that final mark.

So have been wasting a lot of time this weeks watching stuff. Watched the old documentary called <i>Dear Zachary</i> (That just almost emotionally ruined me) and I had watched it just after watching the shooting episode of <i>Glee</i>. Also watched <i>We Bought a Zoo, The First Time</i> and in between all that I watched <i>Pitch Perfect</i> a few hundred (OK more like 5 or so) times (Skylar Astin is totally my new hollywood heartthrob crush). Now I'm watching the <i>Top of the Lake</i> series. Currently am downloading then have <i>Anna Karenina</i> to watch. Need more stuff to watch though. Have two weeks to fill in and don't want to get to bored cause then I will online shop. Any ideas on shows or movies I should get into watching?

Also will be using some of the spare time to catch up on my reading. Must finish reading <lj user=""facingtheanimal"">'s book and then read the new Jodi Picoult book and start the <i>Harry Potter</i> series. Also need to re-read <i>The Crossfire</i> series seeing as the third (AND NOT THE FINAL!!!!!) book is due out soon. Have my nephews down the second week and the first, with Anzac Day, will be getting people to fill in out questionnaires.

What a week this world is having bombs going off in Boston and Iraq, deadly earthquake in Iran, American senate blocked bipartisan legislation and the explosion in Waco. What is the world coming two, we are hating on each other, blowing each other up and threatening to fight each other. When will the world learn that violence hasn't fixed anything but history just keeps on repeating itself.

But at least one good thing that has happened this week is that Marriage Equality became equal. We are the 13th country to do so! Although it was monumentally historical moment last night you know what? MY LIFE HASN'T CHANGED ONE IOTA. I really don't get why it was such a big deal. How dose is affect my life or my idea of marriage if my gay friends can get married. They have the same rights as me as a human beings. It has no bearing on my life at all. So yeah so happy that ANYONE can marry their loved one in NZ!

Anyhoo, I wasted enough time here. Off to try and find something else to cure my boredom with."

"event","Got my O&M test results back on Monday. Got 89% so have 17.8 towards my final mark already. Also handed both my HR assignments in this week! So only have 2 assignments and 1 presentation on the go. Probably get the next HR assignment next week which is all for the term.

Also had a meeting with the manager at the RSA meeting. Was quiet interesting but discovered just how close to shutting down the place is. They are already in talks with some of the other clubs to see if they can amalgamate together. He's very forthcoming with stuff which makes me feel better about doing them rather than Movie Max. He also invited our entire group to have a free meal there one night so that we can chat to their patrons and experience the RSA first hand. Our proposal is almost done and we are prepping for the presentation. Will be glad when it's over on the 13th and we can get into the full report and start surveying and researching etc. 

Also realised the other day I, without even trying, can get the NZIM Diploma in Management. Just have to apply to the NZ Institute of Management at the end of the semester to cross-credit stuff to them. Costs $205 but for another Level 5 qualification, might as well. 

Been naughty and spent lots lately. Being Easter and all everything is on special. I brought a <a href=""http://www.pagani.co.nz/ProductDetail?CategoryId=5&amp;ProductId=1074&amp;Colour=RED"">red trench coat</a>, <a href=""http://www.pagani.co.nz/ProductDetail?CategoryId=5&amp;ProductId=1055&amp;Colour=RED"">red blazer</a> and black and red dress (Don't have it on their online store) from Pagani. Some <a href=""http://www.glassons.com/product/Fingerless-Bear-Gloves?i=GL15414BEA&amp;v=22805843"">bear gloves from Glassons</a>, a <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/Women-Summer-New-Fashion-Short-sleeve-Dots-Polka-Waist-Dress-Korean-ES9P-/281041192231?pt=AU_Womens_Clothing_2&var=&hash=item416f5c4527"">Black polka dot dress</a> (sans the ugly belt, I'll get a prettier brown belt to go with it). and a few necklaces from <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AnnieBlackberry"">Annie Blackberry</a> including my own nz necklaces to match my earrings I got last year, a love spinner necklace and cool rose ring.

Must stop buying things! But I also really really want these <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=291382704327553&amp;set=a.289443594521464.1073741834.173203856145439&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=5"">Wonder Woman earrings</a> from my favourite jewellery store.

Ages ago did one last craft project before class load got epic. made myself a nail polish holder by painting an old spice rack. It also holds my perfume bottles:<center>

So that's pretty much my week. So terribly boring. Nothing much other than studying, procrastinating and a bit of shopping tomorrow with mum makes up my easter.

Hope you all have a far more exciting easter than me! Enjoy the 5 day weekend!

Right should got finish question 5 for O&M assignment. If I do one a day I'll finish it just before it's due on the 19th. Stupid assignment has 19 questions to it."

So after the O&M test on Wednesday (it went alright) I've had a four day weekend seeing as we didn't have tutorials on Friday and I didn't have my Saturday class but as exciting as the Farmers Club day was (Brought the coolest hoodies and Keep Calm storage tins) and hanging out for lunch and shopping with Maggie and Sarah Friday and tea at the new sushi place in town with my sister on Saturday. My weekend has looked like this:
Finished HR Assignment 1(a) (Due 27/03)
Started and finished App Man Group Proposal Evaluation (Due 19/04)
Started and finished HR Assignment 1(b) (Due 03/04)

My brain is now fried! But now have a lighter workload for the last 3 weeks of term. Have to do:
13/04 App Man Group Proposal & Class Presentation
19/04 O&M Assignment 1
19/04 HRM Assignment 2

"event","SERIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE!

When there are a group of people in their pjs standing in the middle of the road shouting and waving at you to slow down and stop! FUCKEN DO IT! We are warning you of a car crash and stop you from killing yourself and your dickhead drunken mates! Boys racers really do have death wishes!

A hoon just raced down Athol Place, lost control then hit the loose shingle and smashed into a pole (coincidentally a pole that no one in the neighbourhood could remember even being there), us neighbours were cleaning up, making sure it wasn't a power pole with lines down and stopping traffic and this car full of dickhead guys race down at 70km towards us all and almost run us all over then almost smash into the already mangled mess of the original crash.

The guy that hit the pole was about 16 or 17 so would have only just got his licence. I would say restricted so was speeding home to beat the 10pm driving curfew (and driving mum and dad's 4WD most likely). Didn't realise there was a give way island at the corner of Glen/Athol and then two slight bends at the corner of Athol/Elmsdale (my street), lost control, hit the execrator to try and get out of it and hit the loose shingle and went into the pole. Then tried to drive off but didn't get very far.

Could hear the whole thing happen though. heard him racing down the hill, then hit the brakes as he went through the island, then the screech of the brakes and crunch of the shingle before the massive bang. Mum and Dad stayed inside and they said they could see all the people staying at the camping ground all wondering around trying to see what happened. Show how loud it was. So luckily the only casualty was the pole. Although it took the cops almost 1/2 and hour to bloody well get here.

So needless to say that really has put a stop to my marathon study session for the night!"

Haven't really done much. had a full week of classes last week so that was pretty full while trying to get my HR assignment done (stuck on one question but have done the rest) and study for this Wednesday's test for O&M. By god, Monday I got 2 more assignments handed out so I have 1 test, 6 assignments and 1 presentation due in the next 4 weeks. My god, bring on the end of term!

For those following the Applied Management assignment we got a no from Movie Max because according to the accountant, tit was far too commercially sensitive to allow us to do it or something plus the manager was having triple by-pass last week. So after getting no from the Hospital (we were going to try and sort out how to get people turning up wot appointments or how to let people know when specialists are running late so they don't end up sitting int he waiting room for hours) and the NZ army (why the retention rate is so low) we have gotten a resounding YES from the RSA so we are going to investigate low attendance/membership to the RSA (Returned Services Association for the overseas peeps, like you Veterans agencies) for young to middle aged people. Especially as youth attendance at Anzac Days are at an all time high. Our working title is ""Keeping the Legacy Alive"". Should be a good project and with Anzac Day coming up next month it's perfect timing.

But anyhoo I should stop procrastinating and go have a shower then start studying for tomorrow's test and do some RSA research for the group meeting tomorrow."

Two pairs of  sunglasses later (Although they were buy one get one free :P). Brought some pacman earring and a R2D2 necklace form Mr Vintage and a couple pair of boots this week. So need to stop spending. I feel like a broken record saying that. Thursday went out to see Maggie in Temuka. Other than that I really haven't done much. Brought some pacman earring and a R2D2 necklace form Mr Vintage and a couple pair of boots this week.

Had a boring weekend full of study. Crap weather so didn't miss out much. 

Get my Human Resources assignment this week. FINALLY! Really need to get back into studying and out of holiday mode. Also have a test Wednesday week. Still getting a run around by the owner of Movie Max about whether he will allow us to do the project. He demanded that we make a proposal for him outlining exactly what we want to do and what information we want from him and we gave him it and gave him till end of business Friday to make a decision but then he decided he will decide over the weekend and get back to us tomorrow because he feels that the information we are asking for is too sensitive and industry sensitive. Oh for fucks sake! I'm not holding my breath. Plan B or C might be coming into play. I think if he is going to stone wall us this much at the start it doesn't bode well for the next 4 months and as we have to have the formal proposal & presentation due in under 4 weeks. We ned to get cracking on it. I don't want to waste time with someone we will have to ditch before we do the report. Anyhoo, Josh warned us he was a strange shifty guy so hopefully we decide to scrap the movie idea altogether and choose something else.

Finally went into town on Friday and brought it seeing as I had to go to the polytech to pay my fees. ARGH! All the decent stuff I could have brought with that $1444.06! Instead I'm buying a pointless education. But anyhoo, love my new toy. So much easier watching stuff on my TV than on my iPad or laptop. I can even stream websites onto it. Rest of the day will be spent watching <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>Les Miserables</i> and <i>Raise of the Guardians</i> plus trying to do some study and readings. Oh but fucking small town Timaru. Last entry I mentioned eye-candy's ex-flatmate was in the class this week I find out one of my group members is related to eye-candy through her husbands. 

This week hasn't been so bad. Slowly settling back into the swing of studying. Think I will enjoy my papers this semester. Has Applied Management yesterday and we found out who was in our groups. Got what seems like a really good group! For our project we are hoping to do the declining rate of sale at Movie Max 5 and how they can rectify this. One of the guys in my group knows the owner of the place and is confident that he'll be willing to let us do the project. I mean a Bond movie on a Saturday night 2 days after it's release should have more than 6 people in it! Surely he's aware that there is a major problem. We have to investigate the reasons for the problem then try and come up with solutions to fix it. We don't have class next Saturday! YAY! The Saturday classes are a killer! And cause Timaru sucks there aren't any buses early or late so I have to walk to and from class.

Also have had the house to myself all week and have so till Tuesday so it has been nice and peaceful. I totally couldn't live alone but certainly want to live with one one flatmate or something. Over living at home and not really wanting the whole big flat thing again that's for sure!

Saturday's class was horrible! It's a 600 level (2nd year Uni level) and it mostly consists of a team project where we find a business with a problem, them approach the actually PRESENT you solutions to the actual senior management of said organisation. HARD CORE! Especially as I am doing this relatively early on in my studies instead of at the end like everyone else. In fact on old toffee-nosed accountant lady int he glass informed me I had no right doing the paper and why was I doing it without having done anything. I also had to do some group work with her at point and she just refused to let the rest of us have a opinion on what management was (It's all to do with the hard skills and numbers etc, nothing to do with soft skills or people). So hope she's not in my group for the assignment. But yeah I didn't know if I wanted to cry or laugh over the class on Saturday. Have a few people in the class I know including Su who I got on well lat semester so she'll keep me sane hopefully. BUT NO EYE-CANDY! Result! Although his ex-flatmate is in the class and was talking about him with some other guys in the class. So I don't get away from him totally but at least he's not there!

Saturday night I got invited to Kalo's birthday party out at Nia's place with a whole bunch of the internationals from polytech. That was a chilled out but night night. Then caught up with Maggie for coffee on Sun morn. 

So busy few days. Feel like I have hardly had time to think. Typical though 2 weeks ago I was climbing the walls out of sheer boredom and then this past week everything happened!

Dick Smith has sent my warranty gift card for my old camera which has black spots on the screen. They never asked for the actual camera so I will hang on to for it a bit then sell if. But I got my full money back in Dick Smith vouchers so hello Apple TV, you and I will get aquatinted soon! Also just sold the Samsung phone I won on TradeMe tonight FINALLY. Ended up lowering the price to $750 which is a bargain for the buyer and it's $750 I didn't have before. The buy had a Westpac account the money is in there already. My credit card likes it! Although some of it has gone on textbooks :| But I have managed to get them all for just over $140 second hand for all 3. Now just to pay the stupid fees when they bother to send out the invoice. 

Right I'm off to try and sleep. I think I need a biiiiggggg sleep. Have a lot of readings and study to do tomorrow before I go to the movies with my sister to see Mt Zion seeing as she has free tickets to use up before the end of the month."

Two years goes so fast but the pains is still there. Just finished watching the stream of the memorial in Latimer Square. You can just see the pain in the people who are still struggling with the loss of their loved ones. It days like today that you remember the huge loss from that day, the city at its knees. You tend to forget the shock and enormity of it all because we are all so used to the broken city, to the rebuild, to it all. We tend to forget what life was like before the quakes.

Kia Kaha Canterbury!

"event","So first week of classes is almost over with! Have my Saturday class still to go but I have no classes for the next 2 days. Human Resources seems ok. Today's class was a lot better than Monday's one with a good tutor and classmates. But it sound shard core and I'm going to have to work my butt off to get an A+! Organisation and Management sounds easy. It's basically my leadership class I did last year but a level down. It's with the tutor I had for marketing so that is going to be horrible but at least I know she's an easy marker and how she marks so it should be an easy A+. I don't much like the guys in the class but some seem ok. Have mates from last year in both classes so that's someone to sit with. Poor Grant has me in all 3 the poor guy! No new eye-candy in HR but there is one in O&M so at least I have something to distract me lol and more importantly <u>NO</u> original eye-candy so far. Applied Management on Saturday sounds HARD CORE. We have to actually have to FIX a company - we come up with solutions and then present to the company or something and the classes really aren't classes but us doing this assignment or something but I guess I will find out on Saturday. But argh no buses run in time to get me there at 9 so I will have to walk all the way there! Well won't that be fun but at least it's only 6 Saturdays. But I think I can kiss my A+ average goodbye this semester. Hell, I'll be lucky if i can finish the semester with straight A's.

So that's pretty much my week. Rachael from course started working at Bed Bath and Beyond over the summer and is trying to jack me up with a job there as two staff are leaving and they have hored one person but still deciding if they want another person or not. Dunno whether I want too or whether it will actually happen but we'll see, sounds all up int he air and complicated. I have to drop my CV into the store. Also still waiting to hear back from TnT about their stocktake day. Other than that there are <u>NO</u> jobs going that fit around work. So over job hunting. Really just want something already.

Gee, what an exciting listing this bloody well is! I need some form of life, if only just to give you lot a better read."

So went into town today with Mum cause I'm on the lookout for a old spice rack to make into a nail polish holder (DAMN YOU PINTREST!) and mum wanted to look at Farmers for Kathy's birthday present. So we had a nice wee shop (I brought a black clutch from Pagani that I have been eyeing up for MONTHS and it's finally went on sale for $16 and also a pair of combat boots from Dawson's cause I can't find the exact pair I want in Timaru or online anywhere :|) and we went to Sopheze for lunch. We had 20 mins to waste till the next bus so we went to Acquisitions to see if there was anything for Kathy there and as we were walking out to go to Dawson's - BAM eye-candy is up the street walking into Pascoes. So luckily he did not see me at all but argh the last I want is to see him (Nevermind that he's walking into a jewellers the day before valentines day) but he seems to always have a knack of appearing out of nowhere when I least expect it! I'm just glad he didn't see me.

But argh the effect that boy has on me. I HATE HATE HATE it!Just when I almost got him outta my head and the butterflies had disappeared I'm sucked right fucking back in! It's like the air got knocked out of me. This boy has been do wound up in knots it's driving me crazy. I just an't seem to get away from it. I can't do this. It's just some stupid pointless crush that is going nowhere. DEAR GOD, PLEASE DON'T LET HIM BE IN ANY OF MY CLASSES!

Anyways I'm just rambling here for no point. Just needed to get that out of my system. He needs to leave my system, my head and my life. Okay Universe? You can continue to kick my arse in all respects of life that you are currently tormenting me in and I won't complain if you just do this one thing for mkthnx!"

Such as the Crusaders warm up match on the 2nd. It was sooooooo hot and I realise now that rugby jersey aren't made to be worn in summer. It must have been about 30ish degrees. It was the third tier players but Dan Carter and the non-reserves player were sitting a few rows behind us.

A silhouette of each of the original Big Bang characters. On the back I wrote a catchphrase they always say:

Leonard was really hard to come up with a catchphrase and I couldn't fine a silhouette for Penny so had to hand draw her which is why she look horrible. Took me many attempts to find a pen/how long to bake it int he oven for so that it wouldn't come off when it was washed. But over all, pretty happy how they look.

I also made a tea one:

Speaking of Polytech. Got the dreaded, half-expected call on Thursday to say Tourism isn't be run this semester... AGAIN! So I had to head in on Friday and change into Applied Management. Oh fun, Saturday classes every 3 weeks AND the chance of having Eye-candy in another class. It also means I will be doing 3 management classes (Human Resources, Organisation and Applied) which is mean a very dry and boring semester. But the worst is it means I have to do the Human Resources as my endorsement rather than Tourism so it stuffs up all my class options and means I have to do a paper semester 2 regardless of whether I do level 6 or not. At least I don't have 3 classes in a row again. But argh SATURDAY CLASSES!?!?! Even if it's the next 2 Saturdays then only every three Saturdays it still sucks :P

Haven't done much this week other than to much online shopping. Got some more jewellery stuff so getting a wee stock pile of stuff before I start selling them online. Waiting on some more to arrive them once they are all here I can organise myself and sell them. Had coffee with Mags and Sarah on Friday but other than that have done sweet fuck all. So much boredom it's not funny. Slowly working my way through all the crap on computer to watch. Have about 5 movies and season 2 of Homeland to left to watch this week. Although most of yesterday was spent mum and I going through the office and rearranging it and throwing a whole heap of dad's stuff out much to his chagrin! He is such a huge hoarder but we can move in the office again. One desk and it's entire contents of crap has gone!

Oh and also the tablet I won turned out to be a Samsung Galaxy Note II phone which are worth over $1000. So that is going on trademe soon so hopefully I can get close to a grand for it and pay off a fair chunk of my debt. Thank you ZM!

So not much planned for this week. Wednesday there is a Business School lunch thing on that I might go to for sheer boredom. Mum wants to go out to Geraldine at some point so I might so out to Temuka and visit Mags. Otherwise it's just stop myself from spending online and trying to get through the last week of holidays.

Right I'm gonna hop into bed to catch the rest of <i>Life is Pi</i>. Man the movie is a billion times better than the book! But them again I HATE the book!"

The nephews got picked up last Sunday arvo at long bloody last. God is it good to have my room, bed and own space back. This week has been a catch up week - getting the house/my room back together, catching up on two weeks of TV shows, podcasts and the such. Almost caught up. Just Banshee to go then I can get back to marathoning the TV show movies I have sitting on here to watch. But how awesome is that there are 3 kiwis in major roles in TV shows in the US! Jay Ryan is absolutely rocking it in Beauty and the Beast as is Anthony Starr in Banshee. Also Michelle Ang in Underemployed. It's about time more kiwis took on Hollywood!

Still doing some crafty things to pass the time:

Made another pair of comic shoes but this time with a Marvel calendar I brought (<lj user=""artic_fox""> will love the Ironman & Wolverine parts :P). Some glitter jars to put my make up brushes and nail art stuff in. Also made some earrings. I have really gotten into the jewellery making. Made my sister some earrings & necklaces for gifts for her friends too. Some of these are meant to be presents for the year but I might just have to keep them for myself. Charms were dirt cheap from <a href=""www.craftrunner.co.nz"">Craftrunner</a>. Also made felt batman and superman to stick fabric cubes to keep the boys toys/books in (also made a couple for me :P) and a scarf with all my Shakespeare quotes on it and a sunglasses holder. I hate how they look all cool on pintrest then crap when I do them lol.

Have a few more necklaces and earrings half made as I'm waiting on some charms from e-bay to arrive. Also making a travel changing/nappy/wipes holder for Maggie for her birthday (How organised am I! It's in July and I've already got half her present sorted). 

Saving just hasn't worked. The Warehouse must have heard by moaning about needing new red chucks cause they had then for $69 on their online daily red deals things so grabbed a high and low top pair. Other than that, haven't spent to much. Gotta stop buying shit I don't need. I'm back on the student allowance in 3 weeks so have to stop spending NOW!

I'm super stoked it's Feb now! The next two weeks need to go by quickly! Semester one starts on the 18th and it can't come soon enough! I need to be doing something again. I am going insane! Everything is just so boring! There also needs to be more part-time jobs out there. I need to start applying for jobs again. Speaking of which I really need to drop my CV off at Briscoes!

Found out tonight I have won a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet off ZM (a radio station her in NZ) for rating their music! Didn't even know I could win one so score! Dunno what I'll do with it. Wether I'll keep it, sell it or give it to my mum or sister. I probably don't need it myself seeing as i have an iPhone and an iPad. Can do with the money I get from selling it though! Did a quick google and if it's the new version it's worth $600!

It is far far far too hot to sleep or do anything tonight. My room feels like a sauna!! But I shall hope into bed and do something else other than be online!"

"event","Dear Safari: You suck! I had a nice albeit boring entry typed up. Safari crashed and I lost it all. Totally not motivated to redo it all but I will anyway.

Had last Saturday which was Christmas 2.0. Paul, Kathy and the boys came down for the day and to leave the boys here for a fortnight. Hate the years when we have 2 christmases. One bah hum bug day is enough thank you very much. Wasn't too bad this time around, not too many domestics amazingly enough. 

So yeah have had the twins here all week. Trying to keep them entertained gets hard and harder! As much as I love those boys to death they really are a great contraceptive! Took them to the carnival last Sunday, Art gallery Wednesday, bailed on the Chipmunks trip on Friday and shopping yesterday :P.
Have the museum bug haunting this in the botanical gardens tomorrow. A can foresee us all becoming very  muddy.

Caught up with Maggie and Sarah on Friday argo for lunch and a little shop. can home with only a necklace! Well done me :P I even managed to talk myself out of a red bag in Evolve despite it better uber cute, I can't justify having any more bags. So cutting down on my spending is kinda going well except I had a wee blow out on a new external hard drive and a couple of pairs of second-hand chucks (black low tops and blue with white stars high tops - even though I was looking for new red ones!). I hate buying second hand shoes and yuk! Other people's feet (I have such issues with feet) but they were in almost new nick and I just can't afford new chucks atm and I can't live without at least a pair of chucks! Trying to keep my pocket money spending to under $30 a week and it's working (sans the hard drive which I really needed). Next couple of weeks I want to try and get enough money away to buy a necklace or two  that Roe makes. Good thing with the boys being here is that it gives me something to do and doesn't cost me any money. 

I was gonna upload some more of my craft projects I've done but I might leave that for the next time seeing as my battery is about to die and the cord is the office (where I have to sleep while the boys invade my room). BUT OMG I am so over have my stuff strewn all over the place. I hate not having my own space. I also hate having to sleep on a springy fold out bed. Bring on the weekend and I get my space, room, and bed back."

New Years has been pretty lame. Well all of 2013 has been lame so far. Only really exciting this I've done was go to the Annah Mac concert last Saturday at the Bay. I am so glad I didn't pay for the concert cause it was pretty crap. Most of her songs were the same and I felt like I was at a funeral not a concert. Saw Nikki while we were there and she completely ignored me. So whatever. Min you I didn't exactly run over to say hello. I'm over it. Her loss, my gain. I have enough real friends in my life that I don't need to waste time with fake friends who only want to acknowledge me when it suits her.

Mum and Dad came back for Chch a few days ago. I'm back in the good books somehow but that won't last long.

I love how well the ballet flats came out. Don't know how well they will be for walking in but they look cool. Want them to dry so I can wear them :P. I love the Darth Vader necklace too. I love the Stormtroper necklace I brought a while ago when it was 1/2 price but didn't want to pay full price for the Darth Vader one so made a cheap knockoff. Doesn't look too bad and only cost $15 not $50

Have a few other things I plan to make over the next few weeks till I got back to tech next month. Just gotta find the bits and pieces and have to wait for some to arrive in the post. Some more earrings, a sunglasses holder, scarf with quotes on it and superhero bins. We'll see what I do end up doing.

Made about $140 selling crap on trade me this week. Most of it was just crap I had lying around like my old touchscreen phone, digital camera and the rest was just crap. But regardless, it's a bonus! 

Done two of my 52 random acts of kindness for the year:
1) Donate a pile of brand new baby things to Family Works to help a mum with a prem baby.
2) Gave a little boy my lollipop

Other than that I really have done nothing or seen anyone. Really need to find a social life! I'm going stir crazy with boredom! I'm also going through another whole I-hate-myself-and-everything-about-me stage which I really need to snap out of but I don't how to this time."

"event","Most of these are just last years one rehashed cause I was a failure last year at them all.

1)<b>Finish my Diploma with straight A's:</b> Complete level 5 and start level 6.

2) <b>Get a job:</b> Preferably business related one that can become full time once I finish studying. But ANY form of a job would be great.

3) <b>Pay off debts and save some money:</b> Pay off the rest of my debts then save money for moving back out of home then same money for my next OE.

4) <b>Move:</b> Be it just out of home or out of town. As soon as I have a job, I'm out of here in some way shape of form. It's most likely to be somewhere in Timaru as I will be studying all year at this point.

5)  <b>Leave the country at least once:</b> It's been over TWO years since I have left the country. It's doing my head in. I really want to go to Samoa this year and see Aigia!
 
6) <b>Get my license:</b> Aiming to get my restricted at least, but hopefully my full. Once debts are paid off I can start paying for lessons seeing as it's been a good 4 or 5 years since the last time I drove. Do a defensive driving course once i have my restricted so I can cut down the time till I can get my full.

7)  <b>Lose weight:</b> start with baby steps with little changes to the way I eat. I will try and keep a food journal. Do at least 30 mins of walking a day. Drink 2 glasses of water before every meal to bloat me so I don't eat to much. Cut out snacking. Make sure I have a decent breakfast each day. Then will start at the gym once I have my debts paid off and can afford the membership fees (Aiming at April-July sometime).

8) <b>Run 5 kms:</b> I'm not a runner in any way shape of form but I have always wanted to be. I want to try and do the <a href=""http://www.c25k.com"">couch to 5km</a>. Aiming to this in the later half of the year once I have hopefully lost some weight before I try it.

9) <b>Do 52 random acts of kindness:</b> Last year my aim was to read a book a week so going on that theme I've decided each year to do something 52 times kinds thing. So this year I decided to random acts of kindness as this is easy and not very time consuming. It has to be anonymous though so leaving money on a vending machine or putting money into an expired meter kinda thing. I will keep track of them <a href=""http://mznaughty.livejournal.com/275605.html"">here</a>.

Well. I'm not very hopeful about any of those but hopefully I can fulfil a few of them. Most of those goals were the same as 2011 and 2012 and they still haven't been achieved. They are not that unachievable are they?  I really really need to feel like I am achieving something in life. I can't keep going along with the status quo. I can't continue hating myself like I do, especially when I look in the mirror. I've always hated the way I look and tell myself to do something about it every year but never do. It's like this big hurdle that I just can't seem to start and complete it. I just don't get it. I used to be such a motivated person and anything I put my mind to I would hard my arse off, sacrificing whatever I had to to make sure I achieved said goal. But this one I just can't seem to do. It's the same with the driving.

Maggie got me a vintage airmail looking iPhone case, couple of <a href=""http://diva.co.nz/dog-tag-best-friend-necklaces.html"">Best</a> <a href=""http://diva.co.nz/kick-it-with-my-bffl-necklace-set.html"">friends</a> necklace (Absolutely love the boot one!) and a charm bracelet and white flower brooch thing. My sister got me a The Big Bang Theory calendar, iTunes voucher, Keep Calm and Carry on notebook and homemade Paris and London cut out word things. My parents got me a Union Jack rubbish bin (Seriously a bin? Ah ok) and salt and pepper shakers (Ah what the? I don't eat salt of pepper) (you know you are getting old when your christmas presents become boring and practical). They also got me Little Miss Naughty note book and Union Jack socks, Union Jack teddy bear kinda thing (I don't really know how to explain it. It's like a cushion and a bear in one):

I got myself a Big Bang Theory t-shirt and a American themed t-shirt from Jay Jays and a sellotape dispenser in the shape of a high heel! Noting from either brothers but that's no surprise! Don't expect anything either.

The day was good. Just a quiet get up, get ready then went out to Maggie's place in Temuka for lunch with her family then came home for tea, bad TV and the rest of my margarita mix. 

Haven't done much since Christmas, just mucking about home and in town. Also having to go over to the sister's house to water her plants and clear her mail. 

I got soooo bored the other day and signed up to <a href=""http://pinterest.com/mznaughty"">Pintrest</a>. Oh dear. I put it off for so long. It's a great way to waste a day. I now have plenty of things to make during the rest of my holidays such as comic book ballet flats, my favourite quote on a scarf, superhero storage bins, big bang theory mugs and hangers to hang sandals & jandals.

So that's it for 2012. I'm seeing the new year in by drinking a bucket (literally!) of strawberry daiquiris and watching bad TV not eh couch. I am so hard core and social and popular you know.

Anyways, thanks for sticking by me in 2012. Hope you have a great night however you are celebrating (or aren't). Stay safe and I'll see ya all next year! I hoping 2013 will be my year and full of new beginnings and opportunities."

"event","I feel like it has been that long till my last entry. I think it was just after my birthday? Not a hell of a lot has happened since. Just usual stupid family crap. I am so thankful to be away from the family for Christmas this year. Drama-free X-mas and New Years! Hurah! Man I wish I came from a proper family. One that actually love each other and just not the hot mess that mine is. That's what Christmas is like right? 

I really have shit all to write in here but I'm wasting time till midnight so I can open my presents! I am opening them tonight so I don't have to get up early tomorrow to do it before I head out to Maggie and Chris' place in Temuka to spend the day with her and her family. 

Her little boy turned one last week! So had his party Sunday afternoon. Man I love the small town mentality of this area! There were a few peeps from Temuka High days and they are still just a snobby and self-righteous as they were back then.

Oh and looky <a href=""http://www.aoraki.ac.nz/about-us/news-events/aoraki-polytechnic-timaru-graduation-special-award-winners"">here!</a> Scroll to the bottom and viola! There's my name :P Under the Bank of New Zealand Prize. I hear it was int he paper too. The prize finally arrived int he post the other day with my official results (Oh look I got two A+ and A, what a surprise) and it was $50 paper plus voucher. Damn, wish it was a Whitcouls voucher as they have a better selection of books and actually have DVDs and stuff. But I'm sure I'll spend it somehow. Probably on stationery for next year otherwise hopefully mum or dad will buy it off me :P

The guy that abducted that that boy from around the corner has been <a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/8089826/Schoolboy-assault-accused-named"">named</a> and low and behold it's a Krouse! I use to have to look after all those kids in Sunday School back in the day. He was always a loose unit and it was only a matter of time that one of those 7 kids ended up committing a crime. 

Been feeling really down and lonely and crap lately. Going through another one of my ""I hate everything about myself"" stages. Just feeling like a complete and utter failure and like I just haven't gotten a thing in life right or that I don't have a thing going for me. I have no significant boyfriend (and not even close to the fact), I have no kids, no house, no job, no career and no friends (in this hemisphere anyway). I am up to my eyeballs in debt, my stupid degree is in useless subjects and I'm studying a business diploma which isn't helping me in any way, I can't drive, I'm fat and ugly. I have absolutely nothing going for me and my future is not looking very bright.

I'm also missing not having classes with damn Eye-Candy. I miss not getting to hang out with him and I just can't stop thinking about him. haven't seen him since our exam together and that seems sooooo long ago. I miss the fun crap we did in class together. Where my serendipity moment where I get to run into him? But it seems we don't do anything similar for us to run into each other and being a lot younger than me, we won't have any mutual friends. I don't even know why I'm bothering with him, I just miss his company.

30 mins to Christmas here. Even thought most of you reading this are still in the early hours of X-mas Eve. But anyhow I won't be updating till after the fact. SO HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE. Hope you have a safe and merry christmas and that you enjoy yourself whatever you are doing."

My sister got me Ritchie's book.
Maggie got me the iPhone cases.
I got myself the complete box set of Outrageous Fortune.
Stacey got me those AWESOME AMAZING tea bags and this cool heart wall thing that you can write stuff on and rub off it: <a href=""http://mznaughty.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/467/173328"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/mznaughty/496576/173328/173328_300.jpg"" alt=""Quote Heart"" title=""Quote Heart"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>
Mum and Dad got me the Mr Vintage voucher, the red belt and star necklace. They also got this compact mirror: <a href=""http://mznaughty.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/1223/177798"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/mznaughty/496576/177798/177798_300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0402"" title=""IMG_0402"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a> yes that's a mirror that looks just like my mac. So friggin cute is that!

Anyways, had a get together with some of the girls from course on Friday and Nia and Ashlee had made me a cake awwww. The catch up ended abruptly when we found out another classmate had been in a major car accident so we had to rush out to Waihi and pick her up. THANK GOD she is okay and everyone walked away uninjured but it could have gone so differently. Our friend had been driving down from Ashburton and had stopped at the train tracks as the lights were flashing. The woman behind her that was riding up her ass wasn't paying attention and rammed into her sending both cars onto the TRACKS! Lucky her instincts kicked in and she was able to drive the car (and the other one that was stuck to her car) off the tracts seconds before the train came through. The other women had a 4 weeks old baby in her car too. But thankfully the first responders were a nurse and a first aider so everyone way all ok. So relieved. Poor thing.

Rest of my birthday weekend was spent mucking about and wishing I had more of a social life. Sunday was the family meal out. Argh. Hate family stuff!

I was in tears on Sunday morning cause of my a-hole brother who decided to abuse me instead of wishing me a happy birthday. Paul messaged me on skype saying they needed a favour and was told that they need someone to look after the boys on next Thursday as they finished school that Wednesday so I had to go to look after them. I can't and said that so them they grumbled and me and did the whole ""don't you love your nephews"" thing (Umm, excuse me Pot, Kettle, Black. If you took 2 seconds out of your clearly far more important life than mine, and realise you had forgotten my birthday, and them wished me a happy birthday you might just get a little bit further). He then said I had to ask mum or dad to do it. Of course mum agrees that her and dad can do it. Then somehow the conversation ends with mum yelling at me cause I won't go up (HELLO I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS I have stopped doing anything for them). So I storm off before I really let rip and let everyone know what I really feel. Then about 10 minutes later another skype message saying that seeing as it is mum and dad going up can they go up a day early and pick the kids up on the Wednesday and go to their prizegiving so they don't have to (WAIT WHAT, we are REPLACEMENTS now?). So I have now deleted skype and refuse to use it now. If they want to talked to mum or dad they can go through some other channel. I am completely done with them. Which sadly means I probably will no longer get to spend much time with the nephews but I have just been pushed to many times by them.

Which is why I refuse to go up there over Christmas/New Year to house sit while they are all away with Kathy's family. Mum, Dad and Tracey are all heading up there and I refuse. So I am having a lonely Christmas down here by myself. Sounds sad but I am kinda looking forward to having a drama and family-free Christmas! Will be lonely sure but as long as they are no Layts around it gotta be better than the alternative. So have the house to myself from the 19 Dec to the 8th Jan. Can't wait!

But in other better news. I got a letter on Saturday from the Polytech saying congratulations on my great results and high standard of work and to inform me that I had won the BNZ Communication Award for being the top student for Business Communications for the year. My prize will be posted to me but they never said when or what it was but I guess it will be sometime after Graduation and the ""official results"" get posted on Thursday. Wonder what I get :P

Have absolutely no plan this week expect heading into town on Thursday to watch the Graduation procession down the main street so support my classmates that are graduation this year.

No news back from the Comtecphone guy (PHEW!), ANZ, Postie Plus (Again, PHEW) or Pagani (who are advertising again so re-applied). So still going around in circles on the shit end of the ride of life. No other new jobs listed this week that are applicable.

Only other exciting thing to happening lately is that I have finished my christmas shopping! The ThinkGeek Big Bang Theory tees arrived on Friday so at least go to post stuff to John for b-day/x-mas for him. Just hope they made it to London in time! Still have to send yours Stacey as I ams STILL waiting on one part but I think I will send what I have now and then send the other part when it arrives. Otherwise it is done including my twitter #nzsecretsanta gift which is some make up, bath salts, and a pair of earrings. Received my gift from my one and I got those little paper foldable cube speaker set things. Very cute.

I feel like all I have done this entry to rant and rave. I'm sorry guys."

"event","So I've actually had a life this past week! Which is most likely why I haven't updated 6 million times with pointless entries over the last few days.

Last week I went to 7 Days Live last Thursday. We had front row seats which was totally awesome. Front is always the best. The first half was just all the guys doing a set before they actually played the & Days game show. It was funny as hell although most of the comedians needed to find more jokes as they were the same sets they did when they were down for the Comedy Convoy 6 months ago. Not everyone in Timaru is a hicks and forgets things :P

Got my marks back last Friday. I got 73 % for my Business Communications exam and 87.4% overall for the class which is top of the class :D. Got 94% for my huge Marketing assignment and 72% for the exam which meant 87% overall for the class. Leadership was slightly less spectacular - got 93% for the last leadership assignment and 83% overall for the class (OH SO close to an A+!). So two A+ and an A. I can't really complain. Pretty high marks.

Then I went and spent the day hanging out with Maggie before i ran around like a headless chicken trying to get my CV and a last minute interview for Comtecfone that a friend hooked me up with. But the job sounds dodge. It was like there wasn't really a job, my friend said it was one thing but the boss made it sound the other. There was not set job description, there was no set hours and the guy seemed like he didn't know which way was up. He also said about how he didn't want to pay my the $13 an hour but he knows he can't pay me $10. WTH? You think I am going to take a job for $3.50 LESS than minimum wage?!?!?! Just sounds so sus so don't see that turning into anything. Also he seemed like a bit of a bully trying to get me to work hours that I can't once classes come back. Sorry mate, my study comes first to a stupid job I don't really want.

Saturday I went to the Orari Races. T'was all dressed up and had a good day. My picks got a few places but only one won so I won a whopping $20 which pretty much was the money I spent that day I got back lol. Spent most of Saturday recuperating tho :P

In other job hunting news. I've applied to ANZ for the casual job they have going. Don't know if this is at the ANZ or at National or whether it will be a merger bank or what but hopefully it turns into something - good experience for me tho. The other job I applied for was Positie Plus. ARGH but it's a job. I wanted to apply for the Office one that Presbyterian Support but the others class with classes. TYPICAL! The past 6 months I was able to work Mon, Wed, Fri-Sun and all the jobs had Tues & Thurs hours. Now for next semester when I have classes Mon & Wed all the job have Monday arvo hours. Life, why do you hate me so much?!?!?!?!

So to starve off boredom, I'm thinking of volunteering somewhere over the summer. I am thinking YMCA or Girl Guides but that will mostly be next year so thinking maybe Literacy New Zealand or something like that. At least being a volunteer you don't get ignored, rejected or anything :P Might actually get somewhere rather than nowhere.

Not much else on this week other than a catch up with the girls from polytech on Friday for lunch and a catch up. Sunday my parents are taking me out for lunch as a belated birthday thing. But I have nothing to do on the actual night of my birthday. Ideally I want to hit town and get drunk but as usual there is no one to do that with. Sign. I need more friends in this place especially seeing as I'm here potentially for another year or two. I've pretty much decided I will do the Level 6 Diploma as well so that takes me up to June 2014. Cause you know, I'm never getting a job ever so I might as well keep on studying and wasting my life.

Brought my brother's birthday and christmas presents from ThinkGeek. I got him some The Big Bang Theory t-shirts as they had buy one get one half price, so I end up getting two for myself as well. As you do. So <a href=""https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b9c7/"">this</a> and <a href=""https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/d194/"">this</a> shirt will be turing up on my doorstep soon :D. I got my brother the paper rock scissors Spock one too (obviously the guy version tho) and <a href=""https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/2891/"">caffeine molecule</a> one. I really wanted the Bazinga <a href=""https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/efac/?srp=23"">pj bottoms</a> but they are sold out and the <a href=""https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ea67/?srp=1"">Soft Kitty toy</a> but I just couldn't justify that :P BUT IT EVEN SINGS SOFT KITTY TO YOU! IN PENNY'S VOICE! OMG! SO MUCH WANT! I will most likely end up getting it eventually cause it is just too damn cool not too! Dear Santa though! Also got him <a href=""http://www.geekstore.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=1064"">camera mug</a>

So the only presents I have left to buy are Mum, Dad and the other brother. As usual the hard ones. Although for Dad, Mum, my sister and I are getting hime new frames and new photos of us kids at our graduations and him and mum at his and then putting them up on the wall in his office. Mum is going to get a Susan Boyle CD and who knows what else. Paul will just get stupid vouchers cause he is an ungrateful sod who never like what any of us get him.

Have nothing else to rabbit on about so I'll bid you adieu till next time."

The days are just going so slowly. It's unbelievable. At least the later half of this week I have a few things on. Going out to Temuka to see Maggie tomorrow arvo. Thursday night is 7 Days Live then Friday is lunch and shopping with Mags and Sarah in town. It is also pick up grades day! :S 

I've officially enrolled in the classes next year and got my acceptance letter yesterday which has been signed and sent back. I am doing Human Resources Management, Organisation and Management and enrolled in Tourism but will most likely change that to be either Economic Environment or Applied Management. If I do Economic Environment then I have 3 classes in a row from 10-4 Mondays and Wednesdays. If I do Applied Management then that's three papers on management in one semester and classes on 4 Saturdays throughout the semester (Not to mention there is certain company in that class). But I have a while till I have to decide for certain. Think I'll talk to the tutors again on Friday when I pick up my assignments and exam papers."

One Directions 'Little Things' just came on the radio. You know what I kinda really sort just totally love this songs. Even though it's total bollocks and guys never think like that in real life it is so sweet. I taking it that because Ed Sheeran wrote the song that this is why I like it and not because I like One Direction. Argh.

Random online shopping for christmas presents lately. I brought <a href=""http://diva.co.nz/shop/new/black-birdcage-jewellery-wall-stand.html"">this</a> jewellery stand thing for myself and one for Maggie as part of her christmas present plus this <a href=""http://diva.co.nz/shop/geek-block-necklace.html"">Geek necklace</a> (I just HAD to have it). Even though Diva has a few stores in NZ, they send their online orders from Aus. All good and well. A card appeared in my letterbox saying I had a parcel to pick up from the post shop, so I walk into town and get it. Then the next day another parcel from Diva arrived. They had sent me the order twice (and have only charged me once). So I now have two of those stands for myself and 2 for Maggie and 2 of the necklaces. Umm, ok? I should really send the second order back but by the time I pay for postage back to Aus it will be almost as much as the order itself so score for me I guess.Never had that happen before. I've had things never turn up or turn up very late, I've had the wrong order sent but I have never had an order arrive twice. Wired.

My other attempt at online shopping, was searching for geeky guy presents for my brother. I brought <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/listing/111576283/dr-who-tardis-earrings?ref=sr_gallery_5&amp;ga_search_query=dr+who+tardi+earrings&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=NZ&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_facet=dr+who+tardi+earrings"">Tardis</a> and <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/listing/110348324/r2d2-earrings-fun-and-affordable?ref=sr_gallery_10&amp;ga_search_query=r2d2+earrings&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=NZ&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_facet=r2d2+earrings"">R2D2</a> earrings for myself (Even though I really wanted Yoda ones but they were so expensive). That makes perfect sense right? I don't know where finding stuff for John turned into me buying stuff but oh well. But every time I go shopping, I end up buying myself stuff and not the presents I set out to buy!

So I only have the brothers (including one for John's birthday) and the parentals left to buy for. Just need some stuff to arrive in the post then I can wrap and sent Stacey's present away so it gets there in time!

Managed to keep myself relatively busy this week as in staring at my facebook feed, rearranging my room, shopping and downloading stuff, watched most of Season 2 of Downton Abbey. Downloaded Firefly to watch. This week I will download Homeland to catch up on. So yeah week one of doing nothing was boring enough. C'mon jobs where the hell are you all? I need you NOW!

And for those you are interested Operation: Get Eye-candy out of my head isn't going so well. He just won't leave despite him not being welcomed there! Thankfully I haven't seen him anywhere this week. Here's hoping it stays that way and eventually he gets out of my system.

So cannot think of anything else to write about and I'm bored of this now so I will go find something else to be bored with.

And off course a HUGE GIGANTIC HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the wonderful and brilliant <lj user=""artic_fox""> for tomorrow! Hope you have a fantastic day. Hope you like the present!"

"event","So as of 10:40 yesterday morning I finished my exams! and it only took about an hour for the boredom to set it!

Anyway Business Comms went really well, too well really. I walked out 40 minutes early so I either knew my staff or just totally stuffed up but I knew all but one of the answers and answered all the questions. Marketing exam was okay too, again left 20 minutes early but think I did alright. Find out the marks and our grades next Friday :S Fingers crossed I have done well!

In between the exams was a vary social weekend which probably have involved more study or sleep and less alcohol. I was so drained on Monday I could barely concentrate at the start of the exam. Anyways, the weekend was full of class break ups and goodbyes to the international students who all head back to their countries this week.

So now my concentration turns to job hunting and trying to entertain my days. I want to try and keep active and as little time at home as possible. Try and keep my current momentum going and try not become Nigel-no-mates, depressed, lonely, critical me by sitting at home. But in one respect that has already happened and that is a nice segway into my next topic

Eye candy - I knew this would happen. I knew this was going to end in me being crushed. I had kept a tap of my feelings all semester and just liked the occasional eye candy n class, it was just a bit of innocent flirting and seeing as he only came to classes when he didn't have work it never got to ""I want something more to happen"" serious feelings and when it did it was easy to squash them with the whole out of mind out of sight thing. Then BAM the last few weeks it completely just ended in me crushing big time and in typical Timaru style, I keep running into him everywhere and he came to the revision classes. Realised I had missed him and seeing him around everywhere, just couldn't get him out of my mind. The exam was torture. We hung out before the exam as we both arrived early. He just HAD to sit next to me :| (WHY?!?! He had the entire room full to choose from. So great distraction there esp as he kept looking over at me. then he finished the exam, sat there are waited till I had finished so we could leave together. WTF. Just go away so I can actually concentrate on my bloody exam and just watch you walk out and leave me alone but no he had to wait. We ended up walking out of the exam and standing about talking for ages. But now, there are no more classes and so I don't have to see him again anytime soon (if ever!) OMG YAY! Now just have to get him out of my head! Thankfully while we were talking after the exam found out what paper he is doing so I know which paper I'm NOT doing (except it is my back up paper if Tourism doesn't run).

Right I'm tired and can't be bothered goings into the boy situation any more cause it just makes me sad, ugly, fat and just all mopey."

"event","I've been meaning to write some movie reviews for a few weeks now.  God knows why I kept putting it off, I just chalk it up to apathy.  This is important though, because they're for two really good movies and I should share them with you.  Even if it's too late, you can still have the common sense to rent them when they're out on DVD.

First, let me tell you about a little movie called Gran Torino.  This is about a man who doesn't fit into modern society and doesn't really care to.  He's a man who grew up in a different time and will forever hold onto his beliefs and values.  He's a man who sees the world changing around him and is disgusted by it in a way that I really understand.  Between his selfish, patronizing family and the fact that he's the only white (racist) guy left in the area, he has a lot to be upset about.  Clint Eastwood gives a solid performance as Walt Kowalski, and aging war vet living in a neighbourhood that's slowing falling victim to dilapidation and gang activity.  After he catches the neighbour boy, Tao, trying to steal his car, under pressure from his gang member cousin, Walt becomes involved in Tao's life, and that of his family.  Unfortunately, it also results in him getting caught up in his problems, which lead him to confront the people who are making things difficult for Tao and the other people in the area.

Most people think that Eastwood doesn't have a lot of range in terms of the roles he can pull off, and I can see where they're coming from.  He's well-known for the rough-and-tumble, grizzled hard ass personality, and it's no different here.  It's still a very subtle role though.  You may think that he's just angry for the hell of it and will just solve his problems with guns, but he plays a more complex character here.  A lesser movie would have a man like Walt learn a lesson and become more humane and tolerant by the end of the movie, but he doesn't change and he doesn't have to.  He shows compassion and makes a difference without ever letting go of what's important to him.  I thought this was a wonderful way to handle the character because it allowed to movie to stay away from an obvious gun fight over the neighbourhood and resolved problems throughout the movie in a much more intelligent, yet suspenseful way.  This movie was an absolute pleasure to watch, free of cliches and predictable plot twists.  Don't let first impressions by Eastwood fool you, he's capable of much more than some people give him credit for.

Mike gives this movie: 9/10


Next we have Taken, starring Liam Neeson.  He play Bryan Mills, a recently retired government agent, tracking down his daughter who buggered off to Europe for the summer with her friend (under false premises) and got kidnapped due to her own stupidity.  With help from some friends he used to work with, Mills determines that he only has four days to find her before he loses track of her completely.  He then proceeds to beat his way through everyone in the organization responsible hoping to run into her eventually.

There's not a lot to say about this movie because it's a pretty standard action movie.  I appreciated that there were no fights or shoot outs, and only one reasonable car chase.  In fact, the pacing throughout the whole movie was really great.  Nothing dragged on and all of the less relevant scenes were nice and short.  You really get a sense of him as a government agent good at quickly taking people out of commission, as opposed to kicking in a door and just shooting everyone from behind some cover.  However, the best part if Liam Neeson and his spectacular acting job.  A lot of people may not agree, but to hell with them.  Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor.  He has a great toughness to him, but can show more gentle and caring emotions very well too.  He brought every aspect of this character out extremely well and made the movie a lot better than it would have been without him.

"event","I got through the birthday bash last night about as painlessly as I could expect.  We went to the Beach and the Honest Lawyer.  I still hate bars on weekends, but I was at least able to get some decent drinks and hang out with some people.  The Beach didn't really score well with any of them (Jess, her friend/birthday girl Cait and her boyfriend Rick), probably because there were a lot of old men there to see the girls dressed up for the Sexy Santa event, which I don't mind telling you aroused me greatly.  So if a night like this ever comes up again we may not have to worry about going there.  And the Honest Lawyer seemed to make them happy, which is good because it's my favorite bar.  I find that it gives me the perfect balance of atmosphere, good food and drink and things to do (i.e. pool, air hockey).  So it's likely we'd go back there again.  So now the night is over with, everyone had a good time, Jess is happy with me and I can enjoy my weekend now.

A while ago I picked up Chrono Trigger DS, another remake of an old SNES game.  That system was known for having some exceptional games that have really withstood the test of time, such as Chrono Trigger.  I'm hoping this is becoming a big trend and we'll start seeing more in the future.  I'm more impressed with Neverland Card Battles though.  It's a strategy game where you use cards to summon units and casts spells and such.  It's a pretty unique combination that I've really liked, but it's also great because you really have to plan out smart strategies in battles to gain advantage and fuck over your opponent.  It's one of the few games where I don't mind getting my ass handed to me because all I have to do is adjust my deck for the situation and get back into it.  Unfortunately, it's one of those obscure titles that will be forgotten in no time and never be heard from again.  Thanks to obscurity though, I got it for $20, so who I won't bitch.

Finally, I have a movie review.  AS part of our recent anniversary celebration, I took Jess to see Bolt.  I won't type around the bush and leave you guessing.  I really liked it.  It's about a dog who has superpowers and uses them to help his owner rescue her father from a criminal mastermind.  The only thing is none of it is real.  Everything that happens is just a TV show, and the twist here is that Bolt thinks it's all real.  The director goes through extraordinary lengths to make Bolt think it's all real in order to get the best possible performance out of him.  Bolt winds up escaping because he thinks his owner is in danger, and he goes all over trying to save her.

That's all I'll spoil for you because by this point you either would like to see it or you have no interest in it at all.  I really liked it though, and if you like a silly little cartoon movie from time to time then I'd recommend it.  It's cute and imaginative and different, which is a nice change of pace with all the shitty movies out there I wouldn't even show to lab monkeys.  It has a lot of the usual Disney themes of friendship and togetherness.  I'm worried the president of Disney has no friends to be honest.  It's presented so well though, I still really enjoyed it.

"event","I found a really great way to pass the time at work; books on tape, or mp3s if you want to be technical.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not just slacking off there.  I've been working hard and I keep moving.  I've already lost a few pounds even, which I'm pretty happy with for just three weeks of work.  No, the challenge here is keeping your mind occupied while you go about doing the same things over and over again.  Granted, there's a lot of shit to clean there and it all gets really dirty really fast.  It just wears down your mind after a while when all you do it scrub, wipe, spray, vacuum, etc., repeatedly throughout every single day, no matter what object you're applying these actions to.

So I downloaded a bunch of Lewis Black stuff, him being my favorite comedian.  Among it was his first book, Nothing's Sacred, and I started listening to it today.  Not only did it take up about five hours to get close to the end, but it was very entertaining and gave me something to think and laugh about to myself.  So as I type I'm downloading his second book, Me Of Little Faith, to listen to at some point.  I'm also downloading Moby Dick because I've been wanting to read it for about a year now and don't have the motivation to actually open a book and read.  If anyone has any suggestions for really good books feel free to voice your opinions.  Reading isn't really my forte so I don't have a lot of favorites myself.

I'm starting to get dragged into traditions with Jess and her friends that I'm not sure I want to really be part of.  Her best friends birthday is in a couple weeks and two things will happen; Jess, her friend's boyfriend and myself will have to make a cake.  Originally it was the other two that would make a cake for the one who's birthday was coming up, but now that I'm a part of Jess' life I'm obliged to be there for her sake and to show her friend respect.  Second, we'll be going downtown to party and drink.  Of a fucking Friday.  If you know me you know that I'd rather run a carrot peeler down my arm than go downtown on a Friday night.

It's not that I have a problem with these two (Rick and Cait, for future reference), it's just that we're not really good friends yet.  We know each other and we get along, but I'm not close to them like Jess is.  Yet now I'm drawn into these traditions, and I will be whenever it comes up with any of their birthdays.  I can handle Jess' since I'm dating her and all, but I'd rather do things myself.  It just bugs me because I'm expected to take part or else it looks like I'm just being selfish and don't want to associate with them.  I have to go downtown because otherwise I'd be leaving Rick with two annoying drunk girls all night, and they get very annoying when they're drunk.  And I have to help make cakes and go out to dinner and make preparations for people who I'm not exactly friends with yet, and if I don't I make Jess feel bad and I look selfish.

I understand that there's very little I can do about this.  This comes with dating someone.  If you have a reasonably healthy relationship you become a part of each others lives.  I'm just a little pissed that the only alternative would make me look like a bad person.  I'll say this; my birthday better be pretty fucking good to make up for all this.

I should be getting my first check on Friday too, so spending money won't be an issue ever again.  I'm starting by getting Jess' family a $100 gift card for a restaurant they like (don't know which one yet).  Despite a few annoyances, they've done a lot for me, they've accepted me, and her father even gave me a Goddamn job.  If I did any less I'd be a fucking tool.  Second, I'm buying myself a few games, just as a little treat for myself that I think I really deserve.  Next, I'm taking Jess out for a belated six-month anniversary celebration.  Anything left after all this from here on out is just walkin around money for my own amusement.  I'll likely put away a bit here and there, but I don't need it for anything at this point in my life, so let the good times roll!"

"event","I'm only two days into the new job at Rapid Delivery so far, but I absolutely love it.  It's the best and most rewarding job I've ever had.  Here's why.

1) I can make my own hours.  A typical schedule for me would be to go in for two full days throughout the week, and to go in for a few hours for the other three days.  This can vary a bit depending on how much needs to be done and how fast I work.  I'm free to go in any hours I want though.  I went early yesterday morning so I could see Jess for the rest of the day, but today I'm not going in until 3:00.  Even with an eight hour day I could start at noon.  As long as I don't slack off like the last guy, it doesn't make any difference to them.

2) All the money I need.  I'm making $11/hour while working a minimum of twenty-eight hours a week.  That's plenty of cash for me right now.  Plus, I can work a few extra hours during the week for good measure.  It may even give me enough to move out with Sabo, whenever he gets around to it.

3) Simple work.  I don't have someone telling me what to do all day, I'm not on any kind of schedule, and I don't have to deal with anyone there.  I'm free to clean how I see fit and I can just be by myself with my own thoughts, which is my favorite thing about a job like this.

4) I'm going to get it great shape doing it.  I'm constantly moving around, crouching, kneeling, pushing, lifting, etc.  As time goes by I'm going to end up losing a bit of weight, building a bit of extra muscle and increasing my stamina.  Plus, I ride my bike to work, which will only help more.  I'd say this is a nice little bonus.

The only thing I really have to adjust to is the dust and grime I get on me.  I breathe in a lot of dust and I get absolutely filthy by the end of the day.  I don't mind it for the most part, it just makes cleaning up afterwards a bitch.  Plus, I see a lot of black gunk come up in my mucus, which freaks me out a bit, but doesn't really surprise me.  I just have to get used to working around it and doing what I can to keep myself protected from it.

So soon enough I'll finally have some money I can start throwing around again, so I'll be ready for some nights out.  Even if we're out late, since I can go into work later the next day.  It's a tiring job though, so there will be times when I'm exhausted or when I just want to get some sleep, so try to understand if I don't want to be out too late.  I hate being a party pooper, and I'll try to go with the flow as much as I can, but I only have so much endurance."

"event","My job search is finally taking a turn for the better.  Here are three reasons why.

1) I had an interview at Dollarama Yesterday.  This wasn't so great because the ""interview"" consisted of five people filling out a quick form and being sent off.  What they're doing is hiring seventy or so people to help them (the current Dougall location) move to a new location (near the Wal-Mart on Dougall).  After that, there's a chance they'll keep on a few of them to work indefinitely.  It's not much, and I have no guarantee of getting anything out of it, but it's something to keep some hope alive.

2) Gilligan's just called me about a resume I dropped off there, like, two months ago for a night server position.  I have an interview for that on Wednesday at three (just as a reminder to myself).  I'm not sure if I have it in me to do a server job, but I can learn and I'll be sure I'm as ready as I possibly can be.  Not only do I love Gilligan's, but I love working shifts later in the day.  Plus, if I get it, it can work around my third thing.

3) Jess' dad, the manager of Rapid Delivery, is offering me a part-time cleaning job there because;
 a) He knows I'm a good worker from some work I've done for them around their house
 b) He knew I was in need of a job
 c) He actually likes me and has accepted me into the family thus far

I'll be going in two days a week cleaning place.  AND I can go in whatever two days I want, as long as I spread them out throughout the week a bit (to make sure I the place is actually dirty again when I go back).  AND I'm free to go in whatever hours I want, as long as I put in eight hours each day and get my work done.  Plus, on the side he'll have me driving a forklift to help him out from time to time, since he can't drive them, and doing whatever other odd jobs may pop up.  It's $11/hour and I can expect to work about twenty hours a week, give or take.  The best thing is, this job is a sure thing, unless the place burns down or something.  The guy who was doing it before got his two weeks and I'm set up to take over.  Fuckin' eh!  

So at the very least I'll be working at Rapid and earning roughly $200 per week.  That'll ensure that I can finally have some money to throw around.  And if I can get this job at Gilligan's too I'll have enough money to move out with Sabo whenever he gets around to it.  Then we'll be free to have gay sex as much as...I mean, watch the game and talk about chicks with a bunch of other manly men!  GRRRRR!!!

On the subject of moving out, it's become irritatingly clear that my dad doesn't want me to move out.  I've had a good run living here.  I've had a lot of freedom to do pretty much whatever I want, as long as I don't break the law or burn the house down or anything.  They never charged me rent.  I can come and go as I please, eat whatever I want, and they've always helped me out when I need it.  And in exchange, I help keep the house running smoothly, these days more than ever.  My dad doesn't want to be an ""empty nester"" and doesn't really see why I should move out right away.  He was partially kidding when he first said he, but it told me he would fix up the old boarding house in the back for me to live it, since no one has lived there for years.

I have to look at it from my point of view though.  Moving out means I start establishing my life again.  I could move out with Sabo and have a roommate I actually like having around, while splitting the rent and making things ten times easier on each of us.  Jess could stay with us a lot and have a much easier life, seeing as she has to come here from Amherstburg almost every day for either school or work.  And it would just be kind of cool to finally be out of here and change my life a bit.  Not that I have anything to complain about here, it's just about time for me to move on.  Things probably won't go as well around here without me.  My parents are getting old and need more help around the house, running errands, etc.  That's just the price I'll have to pay though.  I guess I'll see what happens Wednesday.  Wish me luck, everyone."

"event","This one is for all you fuckers who watch CNN and Fox News and get your political opinions fed to you by Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly.  Twats.  Sabo, Jay and myself saw W last night to find out if Oliver Stone could redeem himself after that coiled pile, Alexander.  He did not.

I don't need to tell you what it's about.  It just goes through Bush's life (as seen by Oliver Stone), alternating between the present and various parts of his past and leading up to his presidency.  For the most part though, this is an interpretation.  No one knows for sure what went on in these meetings.  No one can say with certainty who was opposed to the war or to what degree.  This is an interpretation by a man who's trying very hard to be creative and thought-provoking with his movies.  Some things we know for sure.  We heard his speeches, we saw some documents, we heard the claims.  That's in there and we can't really argue with that.  The rest of it though, is just what Stone felt like saying.  He doesn't know what they talked about in their meetings, but he makes up some dialogue.  And he doesn't know how some of them really felt about the way deep down, but he makes them voice their opinions.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  You just can't go in expecting a fact-based mockumentary that gives you all the details.  I didn't, I just don't care what Oliver Stone thinks happened, or wanted to happen, or whatever.

My problem with this movie is that it felt like watching a two hour episode of Saturday Night Live that's all about Bush, with no audience or laugh track.  It was like a political satire, which is a problem because it's supposed to be a serious movie.  It didn't help that the acting was really overdone.  Think of some teen drama with really bad acting (i.e. Smallville) and put it in a political setting.  That's what it felt like to me.  And it didn't help that occasionally Bush was on screen mispronouncing words and not taking his job seriously while wacky music played.  The movie tries very hard to be taken seriously, but you can't believe it because everything is either unproven and open to interpretation or a fucking clown moment.

This isn't a movie that makes Bush look bad.  He may come off as a little silly or unfocused, but not bad.  This is a telling of his life from a man who doesn't know shit.  If you're one of those people who thinks that he's stupid just because he mispronounced some words, you'll think this is funny.  If you think he's a good president, you'll think this is a compelling movie.  If you're a recent victim or cranial drill intrusion, you'll like the pretty colors and moving pictures.  Or if you just liked Oliver Stone's recent movies, you'll probably have some interest in this.  But if you fall under any of these categories in the first place you should really consider dying of really painful cancer.

"event","I feel pretty good lately.  I'm not entirely sure why, but I do.  Life hasn't changed much.  I'm still looking for a job, but I'm not discouraged.  I know I'll find something and I expected it to take some time.  I'm not going to be one of those people that says there are no jobs here because if you read the paper, look on any job search website, or go to any employment service it's obvious that there are hundreds of jobs in this city.  People just get bitter because they're not qualified to do any of them so they say stupid things like there's nothing but factory jobs here.  I hate hearing people say things that stupid, but I like proving them wrong too so it works out okay.

Things with Jess are going fantastic.  I had my doubts but this is the most stable, rewarding relationship I've ever had and I honestly have no complaints.  I have a woman who's caring, considerate, fun, responsible, hard-working and not only tolerates my stupid crap, but joins in and has fun with it.  We've really fit into each others lives well too.  My parents really like her and she's made an effort to get to know all of you, my closest friends, and be a part of our activities.  Plus, we enjoy a lot of the same things, including just being lazy in front of the TV sometimes.  And I guess her parents have grown to like me too.  They give their fair share of grief, but apparently they think I'm good for her and they like how happy I make her, and I guess that's good enough for them.  We've only been dating for four months, but we've really come along.  We're very compatible, we live well together over extended periods of time (about a week), and we've both done a lot of good in each others lives.  We're not getting carried away or anything.  Neither of us are looking to get married or have kids for a long time.  We're just very happy and enjoying it.

So, yeah, I feel pretty good right now.  My life is calm and peaceful, I have my friends, family and the love of a good woman and I'm keeping busy and active.  Nothing has actually changed recently though, so I find it a bit strange that I'm so content.  Maybe it's just the nice weather.

I'm also looking forward to tomorrow very much.  It's September 11th so I get to make insensitive 9/11 jokes all day.  Get ready everyone, you may not want to be around me tomorrow."

We had good food, we went to a couple beaches and I got out of the house for a couple days.  It was full of its annoyances too though.  I could barely sleep the whole time, it was terribly uncomfortable, the bugs were unmerciful, it was pretty boring, Jess got obnoxiously drunk at one point, the boat ride there was delayed for an hour until they decided to put us on a smaller, crappier boat and I can only be around Jess' friends for short periods of time before they start to bug me.  The worst part had to be the bugs though.  There were an obscene amount of daddy long legs around there.  They literally fell out of the trees and onto our tent.  They we could always see their silhouettes walking around the outside, trying to get in or fighting with one another.  I know they're not actually spiders but they're close enough to warrant a freak out from me, with my horrible fear of spiders.

Anyway, I'm extremely glad to be back.  I'm just not a camping person.  It's a shame too because Jess is so into it, though that's something we'll have to work around.  Under better conditions I don't mind too much, but I still don't care much for it.  I'll be catching up on my sleep for a few days but I'm still around if anyone wants to do anything."

"event","Being an X Files fan, Sabo had to force me to go see the movie yesterday using beatings and intimidation like he usually does to get his way.  So after I got the feeling in my legs back and he calmed down and sobered up a little bit, we hit the Palace.

My knowledge of X Files could probably fill a piece of paper in a fortune cookie so I'm not the best person to judge the movie.  However, I think I got a general idea of how it compares to the rest of the franchise by the look of disgust on Sabo's face during the movie.  If someone wants to check on him that'd be great, because this movie may have made him kill himself and I can understand why.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it the way he did.  For a while I was kind of into it.  The problem is we started noticing problems with it the further in we got.  I'm getting ahead of myself though.

The movie starts off with the FBI searching for a missing agent out in a snowy field with the help of a former child molesting priest who's been getting psychic visions of the woman what happened to her.  Take a minute now to process all that or else you'll get a headache.  To help figure this guy, they call upon Scully, who for some reason is working as some kind of neural brain surgeon all of a sudden, to go track down everyones favorite conspiracy theorist, Mulder.  This is when things started going downhill.

I think one of the main problems is that this didn't feel like X Files most of the time, and when it did it was very half-hearted.  The only time it did resemble X Files was when they had Mulder and Scully on screen, but only because they show their trademark characteristics of being a believer and a skeptic, respectively.  It's old ground that was introduced in the first fucking episode of the fucking show and they didn't need to make it an issue again.  And that doesn't help the fact that the dialogue between them is atrocious.  It's the kind of weepy, dramatic dialogue where Mulder says some abstract one-liner, then Scully pauses a bit, probably looking in another direction, and says something equally bad.  Then you copy and paste that for about 5 minutes worth of screen time and drink some drain cleaner and you have an idea of what it's like sitting through this.

My second main issue is that it feels more like a CSI movie than an X Files movie.  What do you think of/want to see when you hear about an X Files movie?  That's right, aliens or some other paranormal phenomenon.  Yes, there was a priest with visions from God, but it lent nothing relevant to the movie.  The only reason they needed it was because all of the FBI agents were legendarily stupid, missing key pieces of evidence laying right next to a crime scene, or failing to check the woods next a house where a kidnapping took place.  They could have axed the priest and gave the agents some common fuck sense too.  There was nothing mysterious or compelling to draw you in.  It's just a search for a missing woman like you would see on any cop drama.  It's gets a little more messed up than that towards the end, but still not in an interesting way.

All in all, this was a disappointing and unnecessary movie.  It offers none of the charm of the rest of the franchise and goes for that nostalgic touch that made people like the characters in the first place, only to fail miserably.  There's very little action or suspense, and when there is it's very unnecessary and out of place.  The dialogue makes you pray for death, but death won't come.  And the characters have all the charm of a sewage encrusted rapist.  Worst of all though, is that this doesn't even give X Files fans what they want.  Of course, I'm not a fan, I can only base that on Sabo's reaction and expertise.  I didn't hate the movie like he did, I just didn't care about it after the first half hour.  So basically what I'm saying is that even if you are an X Files fan this may not be right for you, which is the most insulting part of all.  The least they could have done was rip off Fire in the Sky.

"event","I'm not going to beat around the bush here; Hancock was an excellent movie.  It was different, it was fun, it was interesting, it was just an all-around good time.  For those of you who haven't looked into this movie at all, Will Smith play John Hancock (yes, the name is intentional), a superhero who just doesn't care anymore.  Sure, he'll save people now and then, or foil a robbery, or whatever.  He just does it with little to no regard for the people around him or the property he damages.  Not to mention he tends to do a lot of his heroics drunk.  Obviously a lot of people don't like him for this but he just doesn't care.  After a run-in with a man who works in publics relations, he decides to help Hancock by turning his image around and making him a proper superhero.

This is the first superhero movie I've really cared for.  I haven't been a big fan of any others for a lot of reasons.  Some were just downright bad, others didn't show me anything new or particularly interesting.  This one is refreshingly different though.  The emphasis is mostly on Hancock and how he changes throughout the movie.  The villains aren't what's important here and that's great because I got sick of jackholes with mysterious backstories who's only purpose was to destroy someone/something or take over somewhere.  The focus is on Hancock, his origins and how he changes as he tries to turn himself around, and it's all done with a lot of humour and just the right amount of a serious tone.  I won't give it a higher score because the one thing that was missing was a more detailed explanation of his origins, which I was really interested in.  It's given to you but it's still somewhat vague.  Ideally there'll be a sequel where it'll all be explained clearly, but until then;

Mike gives this movie: 9/10

This is a unique and very fun movie that I think anyone can enjoy.

I'd like to thank everyone for being so nice to Jess too, not that I expected anyone to treat her badly.  She's very interested in getting to know my friends, which is why she added you all on Facebook.  She thinks you're all interesting and wants to spend some more time with you (including you, Dave, the one she hasn't met yet).  I really appreciate the kind welcome you've given her.  She's very important to me and I'm really working hard at this relationship.  We're extremely happy with each other, we have a lot in common, we act a lot alike, and so far we have a very healthy, normal relationship without any drama or bullshit to get in the way.  I hope none of you mind if I bring her along for an outing from time to time.  She feels comfortable around you  so far and she wants to be a part of our lives.  Thanks everyone."

"event","Summer seems to be turning into the season for actiony super hero movies and fortunately this year they're doing a little better.  I don't know about you but if I had to see another Spiderman or X-Men movie I was going to go yell at cancer patients in the hospital.  So far the only ones are Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, both of which are leading to a new movie some time in the future, and both of which gave me varying levels of joy.  We've covered Iron Man so let's move onto the big, lovable, green guy.

I'm going to get this out of the way now and say that this is a very predictable movie.  It starts with Bruce Banner living in Portugal, serperated from his loved ones and learning to control his inner meanie.  Sure enough the government finds a trace of him and set out after him so they can study him and use his condition to further their own agenda.  It's a bit more complicated than that since Bruce's girlfriend's father is the head of the group trying to track him down but we've both been there and seen that.  He spends a bit of time trying to cure his condition and remove the gamma radiation from his body but it pretty much just goes from him hiding to them chasing him and getting beaten by a big green man with no shirt and back and forth again until the end.  It throws in a new villain for a climatic final showdown at the end but you can see it coming so early that the guy might as well have followed Bruce around with a ""Bad Guy"" sign around his neck.

I don't mind this too much though because the movie gets down to what the Hulk is all about.  Like most comics, the Hulk series was a busy one, with a lot of far out shit happening to keep in interesting.  It was never very complicated though, which was nice compared to how over-done a lot of other series' were.  Unfortunately, this means that this movie lacks the superior story-telling and acting of the first.  I'm not going to be one of the stuffy ""movies are art"" fags and say it was brilliant but it was better.  Granted, you want to see action and destruction when you see the Hulk but it'd be nice if they at least tried to give us that <i>and</i> a good story.

One thing I did enjoy in particular was the couple of cameos they included.  Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, the actor who played The Hulk in the series from the 70's, appeared.  Each of them were on very briefly so it would have been hard to even notice it was them but it was still pretty cool.  It's hard to rate this because it wasn't a bad movie in any particular way but it wasn't compelling either.  I don't feel any need to talk about it after this but I'm glad I saw it.  It was just a fun little stroll down Super Hero Lane.

Mike gives this movie: 7.5/10

Admittedly, I'm a little excited over where this will go too.  It ties in with Iron Man and makes a mention to the 'super soldier' project that created Captain America.  Over the next few years we can apparently expect to see movies about Thor, Captain American and, of course, the Avengers, a super hero group consisting of the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Captain American, Giant Man, and some others that don't really matter.  Not to mention that in this movie we see a brief indication that one of the Hulk's future foes, The Leader, will be making an appearance.  So stay tuned, super hero movies and the butchering of even more franchises are inevitable."

"event","It was a lot time coming but I finally had my graduation ceremony yesterday and my time at St. Clair is at an end once and for all.  My mom and Jess went with me since this was really for them.  This was nothing but a formality to me.  I knew I was done school after I finished my final presentation, this was just a little show to make them happy.  I don't understand the appeal of seeing my graduate, I was on stage for about ten seconds and then walked back to my seat, but whatever, women just like shit like that.

I'm not really sure what to say about the whole day.  Eleven people from my class didn't show, we were the last class to go up there, the public speakers droned on for what seemed like a slow elevator ride to nowhere and I said my good-byes to everyone I really cared to say good-bye to.  I talked briefly to Len and the gang to offically end my time with them, although I didn't leave a significant impression on them over the years.  Then after partaking in the refreshments after the ceremony, I bid a final farewell to some friends and left for the last time.  I always said that I hated that school, and I did, but there are things there that I appreciated.  I got an education in a practical and interesting field, even if the people teaching it made it hard to get into at times.  I earned a college education and gave myself a good foot-hold for the future.  And I made some good friends that I'll stay friends with even after being done there, which is probably the best thing I could take away from there.

If anyone would like to have a night out I'm up for it.  I just want to hang onto $40 for the end of the month.  Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2 is coming out in a couple weeks and I've been waiting for months for it.  I'm going to treat myself to it as a little pat on the back for finishing school.  I've earned it.

I had some good times and plenty bad.  I've made some good friends and met people I'd like to shank with a rusty bike chain.  I've experiences great successes and humiliating failures, good fortune and irony.  Len, a strange man who's gone through massive(ly entertaining) mood swings.  Sandy, a woman with a cuckoo clock for a brain.  Gord, who has a hard time speaking with his own flaccid penis in his mouth, the self-pleasing fuck.  Steve, the only decent teacher I had there who always acted reasonably and didn't care if we played around on the computers.  And let's not forget the others who made my time there more interesting.

-Jay, who I ran into at orientation after not seeing him since grade school.  He would go on to become one hell of a friend.  If nothing else, at least St. Clair brought us back together.
-Dave, who gave me someone to bother while I was on break or didn't feel like going back to class.
-Kuli, who gave us an endless source of entertainment with his nonsense and bumbling.
-Frank Graziano, who's outbursts at Kuli made some classes absolutely priceless.
-Art Whited, compulsion to give everyone who takes his economics class a B helped me get through third semester a bit easier.
-The man with the table, who said say much while saying to little.
-Wendima, who just wouldn't leave Griff's for anything.  Fight on Wendima, fight on.
-African American Janitor, who made the most of his days and ours by hitting on white women and taking fixin's from Mr. Sub.
-The dean, who showed us that you don't need to show up to work to earn a six figure salary and own a flying chair.

And many more that aren't really worth mentioning.  So let's all embrace my new-found freedom as I say good-bye to St. Clair College forever.    Maybe a time will come when I cross paths with you again but until then...

"event","In an attempt to interrupt the string of disappointing movies lately, Sabo and myself finally got around to seeing the Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian today, and it did us both a world of good.  In a sea of shit-encrusted movies I wouldn't show to torture victims, Narnia has given us something to talk about and be thankful for.

The only part of the movie that really seemed odd to me was the beginning.  You know the four original characters are going back to Narnia but they show up there so quickly that they may as well have dropped in with parachutes.  I don't have a problem with this though.  There's nothing to say before they go back anyway so they might as well just get to the point.  In fact, I really appreciated how the movie didn't really waste any time on frivolous crap that didn't contribute to anything.  Anyway, this time around they wind up going back to Narnia after being summoned there by Prince Caspian, who had run away to avoid being murdered and wound up being saved by Narnians.  His people had taken over and Narnians were thought to be extinct, but Caspian and the others were destined to show up and change all that.

There's not too much to say other than it's just a fun movie.  It's a whimsical, magical couple of hours that amaze you in a way.  The whole movie looks really nice, the acting is good enough that you won't really have an opinion one way or another and nothing drags on too long.  The story isn't going to make anyone think too hard, it's just exciting and fun to watch.  However, there was one thing it did that I absolutely love it for.  There's a part where someone tries to summon an old enemy from the last movie and when you see it you start to think ""Fuck!  Now they're going to add twenty extra minutes just to pander to fans of the first one!""  But then they say ""Fuck that!"" and just end it there, without bringing anyone back or adding an unnecessary fight.  After seeing a movie like Indiana Jones, where everything was tacked on needlessly, this was a huge relief.

"event","Mr. Michael Sabo and myself, having enjoyed the previous installment, decided to go see The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian last night....but then we saw that an early screening of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was showing soon.  It's something you have to check out, it's a beloved character and series.  Well, we dropped the fucking ball on this one.  We were worried about this one ever since we found out it was from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg but they're quality of work really shines through here.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a08PnAc76CI

That's a clip from American History X.  It depicts a person getting what is known as a Smiley.  That is what I want to do to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg right now because they're too stupid and useless to come up with an original idea and need to continue preying off of old movies to get anything in theaters.  It's the same Goddamn thing over and over with them; formulaic crap that exploits past installments with constant references and over-the-top characters and scenes.

It starts out harmlessly enough.  Once again we're dealing with some more foreign soldiers (in this case, Russians, with the movie being set in 1957) seeking some incredible power<b>*</b>.  I won't shoot the movie for that, even though it's already as played out as a Tom Clancy novel at this point.  Indy is kidnapped and taken to some warehouse with a shit load of crates just like we've seen before<b>*</b> to find one with some ancient relic inside.  You know it's him too because through 90% of the movie he's not without his fedora and brown-pants-white-shirt get-up.<b>*</b>  He manages to use his quick wits and whip<b>*</b> to escape but he still get involved in the whole mystery and starts learning about the secret of the crystal skull that was found.  And that's all the detail I'll give you because it's just not worth following along with.  The script is so tired and lazy and just prefers to go through the same motions over and over.

Step 1: Learn a bit about the skull and it's power
Step 2: High-speed chase
Step 3: Learn a bit more about the skull
Step 4: Another high-speed chase

And repeat.  He gets a few helpers along the way but who cares?  All they do is contribute to a bullshit side story that's so pointless and minuscule that there's just no need for bring it up at all.  The story is already stupid enough without all that.  It runs around in every direction like it has a shard of glass stuck in it's head and doesn't know what to do.  And I immediately gave up at the first mention of aliens.  Yes, I spoiled something for you.  Too bad, because if you can't figure out that aliens will be involved when George Lucas is on the job you should get a Smiley too.  Name one of his movies made in the last twenty years where he did something unique and creative instead of just sticking to his obsession.  That's right, you can't.  It was as if he went to all the meetings and kept whining until they fit aliens into the script just to shut him up.

You may have noticed the asterisks I put in a couple of paragraphs ago.  Those are to mark points where the story just panders to Indiana Jones fans by giving them references to past movies, predictable plot twists and overdone scenes.  Others include;

-Villains so evil they should be in a Saturday morning cartoon
-A reference to how much Indy hates snakes because, well, it wasn't clear enough before
-Traveling indicated by a red line going across a map
-Hearing the Indiana Jones theme played an embarrassing amount
-Solving complex and ancient riddles in mere seconds using knowledge of archeology
-Formulaic switching between action and non-action scenes because that's apparently they only way they can drive a script
-Exaggeration used in stunts and special effects, resulting in characters surviving situations that would destroy a person's body and other dying in situations that wouldn't actually kill them

Mike gives this movie: 2.5/10

I won't give it lower because I still like Harrison Ford and he didn't ruin the character of Indiana Jones, who I do like.  It was the script and lack of original ideas ruining everything around him that's to blame.  However, this movie did something no movie ever should; it destroyed my hope.  I had hope for this movie and the franchise but this just shits all over it and panders to people by exploiting their cherished memories of past Indiana Jones movies, which, although not fantastic, were pretty good.  I don't know what else to say, I'm just pissed off."

"event","Beginning to enter my eighth week without my internship, I wondered if the marks I had received were final and ensured that I would graduate, or merely temporary until actually completing my internship.  I decided to email Wieland to find out and got this response.

<b>""Hi
I'm glad you've emailed Mike, as I have sent some emails to you but not received a reply. I apologize that this delay has gone on so long. I'd been assured the internships were about to begin each time I've spoken with Bob. I emailed him last Monday, but have not received a reply. He is an honourable businessman, but I think he may be a bit overwhelmed with all the tasks he has taken on for the city, and didn't realize the time commitment for internship. I will not let this week pass without giving you a definitive answer as to whether he is prepared to proceed immediately.
Please let me know, Mike if you are interested in interning - as it hasn't been your fault that this delay has occurred - and we are prepared to waive internship if you wish to just pursue a job at this time. Another student in Toronto has had the same start-up problem, and we waived internship as he found a job while waiting. You may recall that we advised students to start their job search as soon as classes ended, especially as Windsor has been a very tight market. We wanted to ensure you would be graduating, and based your internship grades on your resume, and 968 participation, etc.
Chris - I'd like to know what you are thinking at this time too. It was my understanding that Bob had spoken to you about the possibility of staying through the summer, once he received his grants.
I have two internships available, but both require transportation to the Amherstburg area as they are with Boblo Island marketing.
Please reply asap, as i'll be calling Bob in the morning.
Sandy W.</b>

For those of you who don't want to read all that, what it's essentially saying is that I don't have to do my internship if I don't want to.  I have the option of doing it and waiting God knows how long to start still, or I can take the marks they gave me and be done with it.  Unfortunately, I don't exactly have the means to do an internship in Amherstburg, although I wish I did since my girlfriend lives out there (more on that later).

I thought about it for a little while and I got a couple of opinions on the matter and came to the conclusion that it's just not worth it.  This would have been very nice to put on my resume no matter what job I apply for, and maybe I would have actually learned something from it (like how to get jerked around waiting for an internship).  I don't have time for this crap though.  I want to get back to work and start earning real money again.  I want to get a car, I want to plan moving out in the near future and I have a girlfriend to think about now.  And even if I wanted to do it, who knows when this guy would get me started?  I could end up waiting another two months.  So I'm ending it now and cutting off all ties to that school once and for all.  The graduation ceremony is next month and then I have the rest of my life to look forward to, a life free of the St. Clair run-around.

So, yeah, I have a girlfriend now.  Her name is Jess and she's pretty fucking awesome.  When we met I wasn't planning on dating her but she told me that she likes me and wanted to try going out so I figured she deserved a chance.  We've always gotten along really well and she doesn't seem to have any problems with me, so why not?  I guess it just felt right.  It worked out and we just went from there.  She's so into me it's just baffling.  I don't know what it is she sees in my exactly but I make her extremely happy and she asks for very little from me.  I know part of her is just happy to have a boyfriend but she still enjoys everything about me so I know I'm doing something right.  I'm letting you all know because she wants to meet my friends and it'll probably come up at some point.  And I promise I won't act any different.  She has to get used to everything about me, even the vulgar, offensive side.  And who better to bring that out in me than you guys?!"

"event","It's time to move past Iron Man, something I should have enjoyed greatly and didn't, to something I shouldn't enjoy greatly but do; The World Ends With You.  This is a DS game I just picked up solely because of the hype it's been generating in the form of fantastic reviews across the board.  I don't normally buy a game based so heavily on the opinions of others but it looked kind of cool anyway, and I had an extra $40 so why the hell not?

The story revolves around a life-or-death game run by a group called the Reapers.  It's held in Shibuya, a real place in Japan, but Players can't be seen or heard by anyone, even though they can see and hear the non-Players as if they weren't even in the game.  Players in this game are given the task to survive for seven days by completing a mission each day.  Failure to complete a mission results in them being ""erased"", while those who make it through the week are set free from the game.  To succeed, Players are given ways to survive.  First, they can (and pretty much have to) form a pact with another player who they then fight alongside with, which leads to one of the main gameplay aspects.  Second, they have access to pins that grant them different psychs, which are basically just special attacks and abilities that allow them to fight.  Fight who, you ask?  The Noise, monsters that the Reapers summon to either get in the way or play a role in missions.  You play as Neku, an anti-social fifteen year old boy who wakes up in the middle of an intersection, surrounded by people who can't see or hear him, with no memories of anything but his name.  After being attacked by Noise, he forms a pact with a girl named Shiki and begins to learn about the game and what it'll take to survive.

The reason I say I shouldn't like this game is because of it's connection to Japanese culture and hip-hop.  I'll admit it, the music is catchy.  I can't actually describe it so here's a sampling of some of the music.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geZ5rxq1v4Q

It's not just the music though.  The characters are trendy and fashionable, they use street talk and slang, they tag shit with graffiti, they dress in hip-hop and punk clothes, it just goes deeper and deeper in the culture.  You have to take local trends into consideration because the clothes (a.k.a. armor) you wear are affected by what's popular in whatever area you're in.  If the brand names you're wearing are popular you'll get pretty significant stat boosts, but if not you'll lose power.  I despise hip-hop culture of course, but I really don't mind it here.  Probably because it's set in a fictional setting as a tone to a very unique and fun action RPG.

Since Neku has to form a pact in order to survive you end up controlling two characters at once during battles; one on the bottom screen using just the touch screen and one on the top using direction button combination like a Street Fighter game.  The same enemies appear on both screen but each character fights them differently.  It's very difficult to learn to manage both screen properly, but the creators have mercy on the uncoordinated and give you the option of letting the computer handle the top screen for you.  I prefer to control Neku because it's incredibly fun using the touch screen and he gets to use pins to attack, and with over 300 in the game you can have a shit load more fun trying them all out and seeing what combinations work for you.  The story is very interesting too.  What I described above is a fraction of what happens.  It becomes much more complicated and mysterious as it progresses and I really can't wait to find out what happens.

On a side notes, I apparently passed all my classes, despite not having done my internship yet, or the journal I was supposed to complete chronicling my adventures there, or posting of a discussion board where I (gasp!) discuss it.  I'm waiting to find out if I actually still need to do the internship though.  As much as I'd love it if they just made up some marks for me and sent me on my merry way due to this ridiculously long delay, I doubt it can be that easy with St. Clair, them being the fucking cunts that they are."

"event","Iron Man has always been one of my favorite superheroes, providing you use the term ""superhero"" loosely, seeing as he has no actual super powers.  So the idea of an Iron Man movie excited me in a way no woman has in many moons.  I wish I could say that my excitement and joy led up to some kind of intense climax in the middle of it all (HA HA!  Double entendre.), but it didn't.  It was like waiting for you favorite meal at a restaurant and when they bring it to you there's a log of shit in it and no one will give you your money back.

I will say two good things about this movie right away because I want to get to the parts I didn't like.  First, Robert Downy Jr. was very good in the role of Tony Stark (Iron Man's secret identity).  It was an odd choice at first but he really got into the role.  I would have liked to see the role played a bit different, and he could have done it I think, but he pulled it off anyway.  Second, the parts where he was actually Iron Man kicked a reasonable amount of ass.  Not a lot, but enough to get your attention before it runs off in the other direction.

Now, the problems.  I found four things wrong with this movie (feel free to share opposing viewpoints so I can laugh at you and say you're wrong).  Keep in mind that I'll be judging based somewhat on how it compares to the comics.  I'm not a comic book geek, I don't even read them, I just think that a movie might as well follow its source material, which this doesn't.  Otherwise why not just make Iron Man fight giant robot Nazis in World War 3?  Now that's taking creative license!

1. In the movie, Tony Stark is made into a fun-loving party animal who makes jokes around, sleeps with models and is drunk all the fucking time, making Robert Downy Jr. perfect for the role in retrospect.  And frankly it's taking it way too far.  Tony Stark is a dick, plain and simple.  He doesn't care about other people and is entirely self-serving.  I wouldn't crucify a movie for changing the character a bit (we should all be used to it by now) but they take it to a bit of an extreme, especially for the first half hour.

2. It drags on unmercifully in a lot of places.  This is hard to say too because every scene had a point and (almost) all of it contributed something relevant.  But every scene also felt like it could have been done a lot faster or not at all.  Honestly, I would have liked to see some scenes shortened/removed and more time given to the fight at the end.

3. Too much emphasis is put on Tony Stark's personal life, and by ""personal life"" I meaning his partying and having one-night stands.  This time let's ignore the fact that this isn't representative of the original Tony Stark and get into the real problem with this, mainly that nobody cares.  Do you care what beautiful women Tony Stark has slept with and plans to sleep with?  Or about the wild parties he goes to?  Well, if you do then get a life.  I'm sick of movies doing this, they throw in scenes like this because the public gets a kick out of it.  I guess they didn't get enough of it in the American Pie movies so now Iron Man has to suffer.  This is not why people (should) see Iron Man.  Granted, Tony Stark does learn his valuable life lesson and sets out to make a difference, but diluting with all this other crap doesn't help.  Just get to the point.

4. The bullshit comedy didn't do it for me either.  Everyone had their witty one-liners and even the lifeless objects provided some slapstick humor that everyone in the theater laughed at like fucking chimps.  A little joking around here and there doesn't hurt a movie but they lay it on so thick sometimes.  It's like the writers were purposely trying to waste time.

I'll go ahead and give the green light on this one but I wouldn't expect much, especially if you love Iron Man as much as I do.  This didn't really do it justice.

Mike gives this movie: 6.5/10

Feh!

I did hear one of the funniest things ever while watching the previews though.  A trailer for the new Indiana Jones movie played and the two guys behind us thought it looked pretty good and claimed that <b>George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are geniuses.</b>  I could sit here and try to come up with something funny to say about that, making it painfully clear that I'd rather watch a bowl of shit than anything these two make.  But this was funny enough on its own.  I can only hope that someone gives these two gentlemen some electro-shock therapy to get them back on track."

"event","I thought Fearless was supposed to be the last movie Jet Li would be in, but then he goes and stars in The Forbidden Kingdom and fucks all that up.  Not that I'm complaining of course, at least it was a good movie.  It's all about this kid named Jason, who, after getting mixed up in a robbery at a pawn shop he visits frequently and suffering a fatal injury, wakes up in another world that resembles feudal Japan, but not before grabbing an ancient staff from the shop and running off with it.  I think it happened a bit too suddenly though, like he may as well have just dropped into that era with a parachute at the beginning of the movie.  The movie progresses along pretty quickly and it has it's fair share of montages, which I made it feel like it was originally a short, twenty-six episode series and they condensed it into a movie for us.  But I digress.

After waking up in this new world he meets some helpful strangers and learns that the staff belongs to the Monkey King, a warrior from 500 years ago who pissed off some immortal and got turned to stone.  That immortal then began oppressing people and stuff, so Jason and his helpers set off to free the Monkey King and save the day.  This was where the movie scored big points with me.  I love the story of the Monkey King and his journey to the west.  It's been used for inspiration in a lot of things and has been used so many times in TV, movies, anime, theater, etc.  I highly recommend it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West

Anyway, I really liked this movie.  The story did made it seem kind of kid-friendly.  You know, teenage white boy finds ancient weapon and travels between worlds and makes a difference.  It's like a Canadian-made anime that they'd put on YTV.  Whatever though.  Jackie Chan is in it and plays another role as a master of the drunken fist (see: Drunken Master a.k.a. fucking awesome movie that'll totally kick your ass), and Jet Li plays a simple monk on a mission to learn the secrets of the Monkey King's staff.  And of course there was an asian girl who me and Sabo spent a large amount of time staring at for....psychological study...*cough*.  So anyway, everything about the movie was very entertaining.  The fight scenes were elaborate and fun to watch, the music was decent, the story revolving around the Monkey King and the immortals was sweet, it was good fun all around.  The trailers made it seem a little silly but it was really a very enjoyable little movie which exploited my love for martial arts movies.

Mike gives this movie: 8/10

Some people has asked about my rating system, being unclear about what a certain score means to me.  It's pretty simple but let me clarify.

1-2: Complete and utter garbage, don't bother seeing it.  This is kind of movie that I complain about every so often because it was just that terrible.  There's a slim chance there was one brief moment that was funny, exciting, genuinely scary, etc., but don't count of it and don't expect it to save this shit burger.

2-4: Not completely terrible but I don't recommend you see it.  It may have had an okay story or a few good scenes here and there but it was still very unsatisfying and didn't do anything as well as other movies could.  See it at your own risk.

5-6: Not great, not terrible.  It just had no real lasting effect on me.  It wasn't necessarily a bad movie and I didn't regret seeing it, it just didn't show me anything that was going to stick with it after leaving the theater.  Whether or not you see it should come down to your own personal preference, I won't steer you in either direction.

7-8: Very good movie that I do recommend to anyone, although I don't expect everyone to like it as much as I do.  It has a lot of good scenes and good comedy, action, story, characters, etc.  There was something that didn't really do it for me and made me not care about something in the movie, but not enough to make me dislike it.  Go for it.

9-10: Fantastic movie, possibly perfect in every way.  If you don't see it then hang yourself.  There was nothing about this movie I didn't like and the only thing that separates a 9 from a 10 is how much ass it kicks.  It's like if Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin were going around kicking ass.  One would inevitably be better than the other but either way there's going to be some serious ass kicked.

Let my widsom guide you."

"event","I almost forgot to write a movie review for something I saw last week, 10,000 B.C.  I probably almost forgot because it didn't stand out too much to me.  It seems to have fallen in with that rather large group of movies that you don't hate but don't really care about one way or another.    It takes place in a certain time period (who knows what year?) and follows the journey of a hunter who's village is attacked while he's away.  The invaders ruin all their shit and kidnap a bunch of people so this guy sets out with some of the remaining hunters to find them and bring their people home.

If you've seen commercials or trailers for it you probably know what to expect.  They have to follow closely behind the invaders and protect themselves from them, deal with dangerous wild animals, enlist help along the way from other victims of the invaders, and in the end it boils down to a massive confrontation that doesn't really stand out much.  I'm probably giving the impression that this is a bad movie but it's really not.  It's something a little different, the acting is solid and it doesn't really drag on or waste time or anything.  It's just that you've probably seen something like this before already so it doesn't leave any strong impression on you.  One thing I did like though was how everyone in the movie had a solid grasp of modern day English, which was nice.  More foreigners should just learn English and saves themselves a lot of trouble.  Anyway, I'll give you the green light on this one, just don't expect to be talking about for days to come.

Mike gives this movie: 7/10

Before the movie started I saw a preview for Wanted, a movie which I believe will be a strong contender for the worst movie ever.  I don't even know how to describe it, you have to see this shit burger for yourself.  It has Angelina Jolie in it though so it must be good.  I mean, she's never been in any terrible movies that have spelled the end of her career.  Oh, wait...

And while I'm berating movies that shouldn't exist, here are three shows that I'm absolutely sick of and should be taken off the air.

<b>Family Guy - Let's give Seth Green way too much creative power and let him come up with even more overrated crap.</b>

Are you a devoted Family Guy fan?  Do you quote the show or prattle on about it with your friends every day?  Well I hate you then.  It was bad enough when Family Guy started going downhill and people still raved about it, but then they had to give the guy Robot Chicken too, which gets way too much credit too.  Anyway, isn't anyone else as sick of Family Guy as I am?  Let's examine the main elements of the show.

1) Pop culture references and social commentary as seen by a person who doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.
2) Ridiculous overuse of flashback/side story things to make jokes, all of which have absolutely nothing to do with anything in the episode.
3) Over-exposure to popular characters that aren't that funny to begin with (coughcoughStewiecough), including throwing them into way too many scenes just to give them an excuse to be ""funny"".
4) Run-on and recurring gags that either drag on beyond the point where people get the joke and want to move on, or that are brought back in several episodes because, well, if it was funny before then logically it must be funny every time after that too, right?
5) Completely changing every character on the show to have different personalities, values, interests, dialogue and everything else that used to make them who they were.

I.E.;
Stewie: Evil dictator looking to take over the world and exterminate anyone who gets in his way ======> The gay best friend

Lois: Peaceful, reserved housewife with strong morals ======> Increasingly wild wife with a history or drug use, promiscuity, drinking, cheating, etc., often contradicting her former self

Brian: Good friend of the family and loyal sidekick ======> Hippie, liberal douche who uses pot often, complains about corporations and protests industries harmful to the environment, and has an obsession with Lois that should have been left alone after the first season

Seriously, enough of this.  Only newer episodes suffer from this, leading me to believe that either the people who used to work on this show are gone or Seth Green has more control over the show now, neither of which can be good.  I'd enjoy older episodes more if I weren't watching them for approximately the 470th time.  Can't it just stop, please?

<b>Keys to the V.I.P. - Let's not just act like dirt bags, let's make a game out of it!</b>

As far as I know no one cares about this show, but it bugs me, and anyone who has a significant understanding of me knows why.  Apparently now it's okay to turn meeting women into a game by seeing who can pick up the most in one night.  Why?  Because women apparently don't mind being treated like Easter eggs.  But wait, how come they always complain when guys don't respect them and treat them like toys for their amusement?  Hmm, something doesn't add up here.  I know it's just a show, and not even a popular one, but this is how things really are and crap like this doesn't help the situation.  It's not just scumbags like these guys that make the world worse, it's the women who let it slide.  Granted, it's just bar trash waiting for guys to hit on them anyway, but it's still not showing the better side of humanity.  Seriously, ditch this bullshit.

Of course we can't forget the stupidity of the show itself.  These guys are such masters that they have the courtesy of passing on their golden nuggets of wisdom to regular guys like me.  For example (paraphrased in my own words but still the exact same message): ""Don't get discouraged when you get turned down by a bunch of women in a row.  Keep going and never give up.  People may not remember the failures but they'll always remember the successes.""  Yeah!  Just keep hitting on everyone you possibly can and eventually someone will go for it.  Who gives a fuck about things like standards, or mutual respect, or whether or not people have diseases, or a penis AND a vagina?

<b>Seinfeld - Let's completely fucking rape peoples eyes with a show a decade after it's over.</b>

I don't mind repeats.  In fact, a lot of my TV time is devoted to repeats because some episodes were just so great you had to see them again.  But come on!  Think of any episode of Seinfeld.  Now how many times have you seen that episode?  Is that number in the triple-digits?  I thought so.  It's on seven times a day if you have a decent cable package, even more if you have satellite or digital cable.  Yes, I know, I don't have to watch it and some people still enjoy it.  I don't care though.  It's taking up a lot of time which could be used to put other shows on, show that haven't been beaten into the ground.

It's not even the fact that they're repeats that bothers me, it's that I've grown to genuinely hate the characters.  I've been watching the same antics over and over and over again for so long that I've gotten sick of their stupid crap.  I mean, if I wouldn't like someone in real life why would I like them as a TV character?  I know there's value in the show, it's practically a timeless classic that will probably always be remembered in the history of television.  And I know there are funny parts throughout the show that still give even me a chuckle now and then.  But I don't like being bludgeoned repeatedly with a blunt object until I slowly fall asleep and die.  There comes a point where repeats can stop, no matter how popular a show once was.  Once technology allowing people to download their favorite episodes became available crap like this really became too much to handle.

And those are my top three choices for shows to abolish from television.  If you don't agree or think you can rebuttal by dismissing my favorite shows, I don't care.  I'll simply wish a gypsy curse on you."

"event","So...no, I haven't started my internship yet.  Me and Chris, the other guy in my class waiting to begin at the same place on the same work, have been sitting around for the last few weeks waiting for things to rolling.  We've had interviews with him, we've been in email contact with him so we're up-to-date on what he's doing.  It just doesn't involve us.  The last thing we heard from him was last week and it went like this.

<b>Subject: I haven't forgotten you

Gentlemen!
Please bear with me as I'm working to get our project(s) started while 
I'm in the middle of managing a major convention in Detroit.
I did speak with the Director of the Festival office and we think we can 
work toward a Tuesday afternoon meeting.
I will keep you posted over the next two days about our next steps.
Bob</b>

I can understand, he has a lot on his plate and I've been willing to wait it out and work around his schedule.  I mean, fuck, I've had three weeks off, why would I complain?  The convention he's talking about is the Automotive Engineers Association Convention, so yeah, it's a lot of work.  I guess Chris is getting sick of waiting so he emailed Wieland and we both got a response that went a little something like this.

<b>Hi Chris and Mike
I assumed your internships had started, however Bob did say he had the Automotive Engineers Association Convention in Detroit, and it's on now. I spoke at length with Bob before we both agreed on these internships, and the opportunity he is able to offer far outweighed the wait, although I must compliment you and Mike for being so patient as we work around his schedule. YES, you and Mike are both eligible for graduation.
Please stay in touch. I'll call Bob early next week for an update.
Cordially
Sandy W.</b>

What's she saying here is that we won't be marked so heavily based on our internship journals or posts on the discussion board because we have less to write about.  We have to do our work for those by the 25th so they can have our marks done on schedule, but even though we'll have considerably less to report they won't hold it against us in any way.  Unfortunately, I'm still stuck here waiting, unable to look for work.  I was really hoping by this point they'd just give me some other way of finishing, but at least this way I get some time off school before starting my internship and getting back to the working world.  And that's my update."

"event","I'd just like to confirm with you all that for the next month I will be a lowly intern, fetching coffee for those who fetch coffee.  I don't know what I'll be doing yet or when exactly I start but I should find out later this week.  Until then I'll be sitting around here like a welfare case if anyone wants to do anything.

I just finished Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7, and I have to say, that was one hell of a great game.  I was hesitant about buying it originally because it's a prequel to Final Fantasy 7, a game so ridiculously over-hyped and blindly praised that it's become almost insufferable.  After finding out it was an action RPG though, the kind of PSP game I've been looking for, I decided to try it out.  And I'm sure as hell glad I did because it was fantastic.

It's the story of Zack, a character only briefly mentioned in Final Fantasy 7 through flashbacks.  He was the mentor and best friend to the main character, Cloud, who had died a few years before.  The game follows a period of his life as a member of SOLDIER, a group of elite soldiers working for the Shinra company.  He dreams of rising up in the ranks of the company to become a SOLDIER 1st class and a hero.  But as time goes on and more and more significant events take place, he starts to realize that there's more to becoming a hero than just being strong and respected and that being in SOLDIER isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Zack is by far and without a doubt the best thing about this game.  He's an entertaining, charismatic character who brings and lot of life and energy to the whole experience.  He has a light-hearted, funny side and a serious, determined side and he works with all these emotions so realistically that you really start to feel for him when something happens to him, good or bad.  I found it downright depressing to see how things ended for him at the end of the game (which is fairly obvious considering he had died just before Final Fantasy 7).

I liked the idea it used in battles too, the DWM slots.  Basically, every special attack, summon and even level up you get is controlled by a slot machine spinning during battles.  When you get certain combinations of character portraits and numbers you get certain bonuses.  I didn't like this at first, the idea of not being to control when you level up or get special attacks is pretty annoying.  Fortunately, it happens often enough that you don't really need to worry about it.  You may go a while without leveling up sometimes, but you'll get there eventually.  I love when a game tries out something different like that, and I love it even more when they make it work.  It's obvious a ridiculous amount of work was put into it, most likely because if they hadn't put the effort in they would have pissed off a lot of fanboys. The graphics are beautiful, the music is great and the story and characters have a way of making you care about them.  I was really impressed by this, too bad none of you have a PSP or you could enjoy it too."

"event","To protest Earth Hour, every light in my house is on right now, every appliance is plugged in and I'm wasting as much power as one human being possibly can.  Maybe now Mother Nature will think twice before she buries us in snow like she did this winter.  And if she mouths off again I'm just going to keep buying and plugging shit in.

I am officially done school and I'd like to tell you about my last day there, the day of our presentations, because they went so well for me.  I was a wreck going in.  I was fighting off a flu, I hadn't eaten for two days prior, I was sore, we were finishing the project the day before from 11 a.m. till 2 a.m., and as the added little boot in the ass we had to sit there for five hours before we even went up.  I considered skipping most of them until Len told us that missing any of them or leaving early would result in a 50% reduction of our mark for the project.  Let that sit with you for a few seconds.  The point I'm trying to make is that it was a long day.

Our presentation went well though.  We were worried we'd get more negative feedback, especially from Gord concerning our ads, but he didn't have any major problems.  None of them did, just minor things.  But what they liked best was me, I presented my part so well that I received absolutely glowing comments from them.  After we finished Steve McEachern was the first to speak up and the first thing he said was ""You did an excellent job presenting, Mike."", noting how me not having papers to read from while I was up there, like everyone else did, made it more convincing and believable.  Len and Sandy concurred too, but not Gord because he's a cunt.  So I got all these compliments about how well I did from them and from a few people in class, but that wasn't my favorite thing.  My favorite part was when I finished my part and moved aside so the next person could take over, as when I look towards Len and the gang to see if their writing anything, Len, with his arms folded, gives me a hidden thumbs up.  I recalled him doing this before to express his approval and I thought maybe I was doing something right after all.

We did have to go in Thursday as well, but it was just so they could tell us about our responsibilities during our internships and gives us some last minutes advice before Monday.  I don't have mine yet but that very morning Wieland sent me an email saying I could set up an interview with the head of J.R. Williams and Associates.  This is a big company too, they're working on something for the casino, they're organizing a golf event of some kind and they just took over the Downtown Business Association.  It's not like working at a major agency in Toronto like Holmes & Lee, but for Windsor this is huge.  If I can at least walk away from there with that on my resume and a good recommendation I'll look a lot better when I start looking for work again.  I'm waiting for the guy to get back to me about an interview on Monday so I'll be sure to let everyone know what will be going on.  If all goes well this will mean much less drinking.  But if it doesn't go well, much much more."

"event","I ended up buying Monster Hunter Freedom 2 because I knew that if I didn't it would haunt me and I'd torment myself for months trying to decide whether or not to buy it.  I'm not very far of course, I'm just taking on some beginners' missions to get used to the different weapons types and to collect some crafting materials.  It's hard to get used to at first, this is the first action/adventure game I've bought for the PSP and playing one on a handheld system takes some adjustment.  I'm getting there though, and it's enjoyable so far.  I'm still concerned the MMO elements may make it seem more like a job than a game but I love how much there is to do in it so I think it deserves a chance.  I picked up a couple other games while I was there too.  First, Dragoneer's Aria, a turn-based RPG that didn't really do that well.  It's supposed to be pretty unbalanced if you don't spend enough time training and creating new equipment.  By unbalanced I mean you'll find yourself suddenly being murdered and raped in just a random encounter all of a sudden, even if you had been doing well up to that point in the dungeon.  I'm willing to put the time into it though so I'm hoping I won't have too many experiences like that.  I had to give it a chance, I've been interested in trying it, I like the amount of customization in it, it was only $20 and I couldn't find Brave Story anywhere so I made it my first turn-based RPG for the PSP.

The third game I picked up though it where things really started to get out there.  Every generation has it's game that completely mind-fucks you and makes you want to find the wonderful, psychedelic drug that the creators were on when they made it.  Last year we had Loco Roco, before that were the Katamari games, and now we have Patapon.

<lj-embed id=""32"" />

This is a rhythm game with an action platformer twist.  Rhythm games are games that have you matching beats, playing music and using patterns of some kind to do...something.  You know, stuff like PaRappa the Rapper or Dance Dance Revolution.  This is different though because it's more of an action game.  You play as this god of the Patapons, the eyeball creatures you see in the video there.  Years ago they were exiled to the ends of the world by the Zigotons, an equally strange race, and your job to leads them in battle against them and find a place called Earthend so they can see ""IT"", which could be anything, I have no fucking clue.  As strange as it looks, it's actually a very strategic and well thought-out game.

You control a small army of Patapons that you can customize completely.  You choose which unit types to use (spearsmen, archers, melee fighters, etc.), you can equip each individual one with equipment you find by playing and replaying levels, and you can create new ones by gather materials, with a lot of different combinations and different Patapons you can make depending on the materials you use.  After starting a level you issues commands by inputting various button sequences in time with the beat playing in the background.  They then hear the beats, which is basically how you're talking to them, and know what your orders are (and they even sing and chant as they go along!).  You just have to advance them through levels to a check point at the end while having them defeat enemies along to way, and that could be easy or hard depending on what types of Patapons you bring along, how strong they are in terms of stats, how you've equipped them and especially how you control them with your funky beats.  As the game progresses you learn more commands, like advancing forward, attacking, falling back, defending, and various special skills.  And you have to use your commands smart too, or else enemies will have an advantage while you scramble to organize yourself.  I normally don't care for rhythm games but this one is pretty exciting, I love leading armies for some reason.  There's a lot to do in it, a lot of customization, and it's not too mindless like other rhythm games tend to be.  I'm going to show it to all of you just I can blow your fucking minds with it."

"event","I just finished watching the first episode of Lewis Black's Root of All Evil and it was just as great as I expected.  Each episode involves two comedians debating in a courtroom manner which of two people or groups is more evil, with Lewis Black serving as the judge.  I highly recommend it.  And for those of you who haven't seen it yet, start watching the Jon Dore Show, it's brilliant.  Seriously, get with the fucking program.

So I guess tomorrow is my last actual day of classes.  We just have to go meet some Steve McEachern about our media section one last time and we're free to finish the project our own way before finally presenting on Wednesday.  I'm pissed at Wieland though because today she tells me that they're not getting the responses from businesses they're looking for regarding my resume and internship, so she tells me I have to change a bunch of things on my resume to try to get a better reaction.  Keep in mind that we started work on our resumes as soon as the semester began and then her, Steve and Gord all (supposedly) looked them over to make sure they were good enough to send out.  I got mine back with no problems or suggestions so they sent it out.  Now I have to rewrite half of it to say the exact same things in a different way, and a week before we're done to boot.  It's possible God may not want me to graduate.

It's setting in now that it's almost over.  It's not an exciting feeling, just strange.  It's so different from just finishing another year and just having the summer off, I'm almost completely done my education forever after twenty years.  And I'm proud of myself too.  It's not something I've wanted to do this whole time but I have stuck with it and I've done very well, despite some rough patches here and there.  Since I've started there I've gone through the most significant events in my life, both with my education and my personal life.  And I know I've learned a lot, even if it's not something I care the world about.  I can do work that a lot of other people can't and aren't trained to do, including most university students in similar programs.  It hasn't been a very fun journey, but at least I can walk away with my head held high.

I honestly don't know why, but I've talked to Amanda a couple times lately.  A couple of you probably remember her and know I hated her for a long time.  I was baffled when she added me on Facebook recently and it turned out that she didn't even remember anything that we had fought about before.  I don't like that either, I don't like when someone can just ignore and forget about significant events like that like they didn't mean anything.  Maybe I'm not one to talk but it still bugs me.  I'm just sick of being mad.  I don't know what the hell to say to her, I have nothing really, it's been a long time and I have no reason to trust her again yet.  I hate to say that but I'm not going to leave myself open to more accusations and insults.  I don't want to be a dick and hold a grudge though, especially if she doesn't even remember why.  She's not even doing anything wrong (though she still has a temper).  There's still a trust issue though so I really don't know what to think.

I need a new PSP game I think but I'm not sure what to get.  I'm leaning towards Monster Hunter Freedom 2 but some parts of it sound just awful.  It's an action adventure game that plays like an MMO.  You take on quests to kill monsters scattered throughout a large, nicely designed world, gather materials for over 2,100 weapons and armor and work out all these strategies to beat each type of monster with various items, traps and weapon types.  The problem is, like with any MMO, you have to do a ridiculous amount of grinding to get the things you need.  It can take several hours and multiple killings of the same monster to get just one of the materials you need for that next great piece of equipment that'll keep you alive in the next quest.  I don't like that at all but with so many different weapons to try out, and monsters to kill and such a large world to explore I'd like to think that it would still be fairly fun to do all that.  I'm weighing my options but so far I think that's at the front of the pack.  It doesn't really matter though, once I'm done school I'll treat myself to a few games anyway."

I went into school more days this week than I did any other week of the semester because of all the work my group has to get done for our final projects.  It wasn't even a huge amount of work, we just got fucked over at the last minute.  I'll explain.  For the last couple days only four of the seven of us were able to meet, two were in Toronto for interviews and one just didn't show up.  The one that didn't show up decided to do our media plan, which includes listing what TV shows, Internet sites, magazines, etc. we'll advertise on, our advertising schedule for the year, costing and rationales.  It's a good ten pages of work so he asked for a little help.  I showed him the project my group from last semester did so he would have a format work from.

So he sends it to us, supposedly ""95% done"" and most of it was the exact same as the old project.  He changed a few things to suit our current project and left the rest the exact same because he thought it would work.  Well it doesn't.  So the group members who are available have it fix it, along with everything else that was due for this Sunday.  That included plans for sales promotions, public relations, E-marketing, mobile marketing, a blocking chart outlining our advertising schedule for the year, and all our creative.  This media plan is a ridiculous amount of work too.  It's not just writing ten pages off the tops of our heads, it's finding costs for every individual thing we're advertising on, deciding our advertising schedule, setting objectives and tactics and rationalizing them all, and all kinds of other stuff on top of everything else.  I could go on about how mad I am at him for screwing us like that but I'll just let you picture how much work this is for us and you can work out your own conclusions.

I hate being in such a foul mood but I can't shake it tonight.  We're done school in less than two weeks and I don't have my internship lined up yet.  They're still waiting for businesses to reply so I can go in for an interview and the longer I wait the longer I have to put off looking for a job.  I'm having the same problems as always with meeting women.  I met someone a little while ago who showed a bit of interest and said she wanted to go out with me and now she doesn't even respond to me anymore.  I'm sick of being ignored, I'm sick of being lied to and I'm sick of not being taken seriously as a man.  There was someone else I was thinking about asking out too but there's no chance of anything happening.  Not only is she seeing someone (who she doesn't even like anymore, apparently), she's leaving town for her internship anyway and isn't coming back to Windsor.  Just as well I guess, she talks about the kinds of guys she likes and I'm just not one of them.

Anyone else I could have seen myself going out with just doesn't appeal to me anymore.  When I hear about them getting drunk, acting trashy and making out with someone new every time they go out somewhere with people it really turns me off.  And I know all that stuff has happened, my group member like to gossip about things like that.  I'm just tired and stressed out and disillusioned with so many people right now.  I'm going to go make some Kraft Dinner and play some Game Boy, it's been a long day."

"event","First I just want to quickly honour the recently deceased Gary Gygax, a co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons and one of the fathers of tabletop RPGs.  I've never been a D&D player, and I never really care when someone I never met dies, even if they were involved with a good game or one that I care about.  But I am a fan of the RPG genre and most RPG elements seen in games today stem from D&D, so I appreciate his efforts and honour him for helping to revolutionize gaming in such a way.  You done good Gary, you done real good.

I'm off for March break until the 17th, or whenever the hell I feel like going back.  What are they going to do if I skip some classes, fail me?  Pfft!  We're tearing ass trying to get these projects done, and we present them on the 26th so we're almost at the finish line here.  I don't have another internship, or interview, or anything lined up yet.  In fact, most of the class is still waiting.  Sandy Wieland keeps reassuring me that something is in the works and that they're just waiting to hear from businesses.  I think she's really trying with me too.  For some reason I'm one of her favorite students in class.  I think she's just seen more serious, academic side of me.  I rarely miss her classes, I pay attention in her classes and I always do well on her assignments.  I'm just trying to avoid failing her classes, that's what set me back so much in the program in the first place.  I'm glad she thinks so highly of me though.  Not only has she agreed to serve as my educational reference on my resume, but it means she's more likely to give me a good recommendation for my internship.  I just have to put up with her nonsense for  a little while longer.

I'm considering looking into truck driving in the event that I can't/don't want to make it in this field.  Jay recommends it and since my brother started doing it a few months ago he's been a lot better off.  It sounds like my kinds of job too.  I don't mind long periods of isolation, hours are flexible, it pays pretty well considering often you do work, and you don't have someone barking order at you all day, as long as you get your load there on time that's all that matters.  I'm just going to hang onto the idea as a backup plan for now and look into it in case I can't find any decent work, which shouldn't be a problem around here."

"event","I beat Professor Layton and the Curious Village.  I completed all the optional tasks within the game.  I beat the unlockable puzzles you get for doing the optional tasks.  It almost killed me but I did it all.  Some of the puzzles made me think about killing myself to avoid having to spend thirty minutes solving them.  Then I remembered that my spirit would be stuck in limbo for having unresolved business in life and I don't need that, so I solved them.  Some of the unlockables were surprisingly easy for me considering how hard they were meant to be to an average human mind.  But the others were the ones that dangled the noose in front of me, mocking me.  The very last puzzle, this sliding block deal where you have to negotiate a large red block out of a confined space by sliding other blocks out of the way, took me well over a thousand moves to solve.  Everything after that is a blank, I my mind may have broke.  It was worth it though.  I unlocked some excellent bonus content and I was able to finish one of the best games I've played in a long time.

I got a lot more into the story than I thought I would originally.  It would have been nice to solve the mysteries on my own instead of just solving puzzles and having the story told to me, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  I was most impressed with the character of Professor Hershell Layton.  He did remarkable things with nothing more than his intellect and a calm demeanor.  He solved complicated mysteries and even saved lives and he didn't need any powers or amazing abilities.  He never lost his cool, he was always a gentleman and he always knew the best way to handle any situation.  It was inspiring really.  I can safely say that Professor Layton is one of the best characters I've ever seen.  There's just this charming quality to him and the characters he interacted with made it all even more enjoyable to watch.  Shit like that is very important in a game like this.  I can't recommend this game enough now, I still think anyone could enjoy it.  Even if some of the puzzles are incredibly hard for you then chances are some are incredibly easy.  That's the way brainteasers like these work, certain kinds can be really easy or really hard depending on how your mind works.  That's why this game works for anyone.  Go on, get it now."

"event","A new game came out for the DS recently, Professor Layton and the Curious Village, the first in a series that is now coming from Japan, and I had to get me some of that.  It's one of those adventure/puzzle games where you progress by solving puzzles and riddles presented to you to solve mysteries and uncover some greater evil (depending on your definition of ""evil"").  It's not like other games in this genre like Myst or Shadowgate, where solving puzzles involves using items you find while exploring or manipulating your surroundings in some way.  I'd prefer those to be honest, but this is working for me too.  In the Professor Layton series you do solve brainteasers and riddles to do pretty much anything.  And these are real mind benders too, not for the weak of mind or those that just don't have a head for this kind of thing.  It has just about any kind of brainteaser you can think of so chances are you see a lot of familiar ones because you've come across them online or in a book or something.  It doesn't matter though because they're hard enough that you'll almost always need some time to stare at one of them while the little mouse runs on it's wheel in your head and your mind tries to figure it out.

Fun Fact!:  The puzzles in the game were designed by Akira Tago, renowned for his ability to create brainteasers and riddles.  Go ahead, look him up.

Layton, an archaeologist with an uncanny mind for puzzles, and his apprentice, Luke, are asked to go to the town of St. Mystere to solve an inheritance problem.  Baron Reinhold had died and, according to his will, would leave his entire estate to whoever could find an object known as the Golden Apple that he had hidden somewhere in the town.  Layton goes to find it, believing that a much greater mystery is to be found there.  Some pretty wild stuff starts happening from there, but I won't spoil it because you never know who'll end up playing the game.  Even though you spend most of your time staring at puzzles the story is pretty interesting.  It's presented very well too, with a combination of very nice artwork and full motion with voice full work cutscenes scattered throughout the game.  Take a look at the trailer and see for yourself.

<lj-embed id=""31"" />


Presentation like that makes it extremely fun to go advance through the game, even though it means racking your increasing fragile mind with more puzzles.  I'm really into the story though so I can live with it.  I like the character of Professor Layton and I like the quirky, downright strange characters he deals with.  It's odd that they seem to solve all of life's problems with puzzles though.  I don't know if that's an ideal economy, but whatever works for them.  And they make it a little better by giving you some side tasks to work on so the game isn't too linear.  They mostly involve solving puzzles too but they're still nice to have there.  It always seems weird for me to go on like this about one game but this is an excellent little title that I honestly think anyone could enjoy.  Even if it drives you nuts you still want to figure out that one puzzle that you're stuck on so it doesn't haunt you for the rest of your life.  I can't wait for the next one to be released here."

"event","I just read about a game coming out in March called Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis that looks like a good candidate for one of the last PS2 games I may ever buy.  The funny thing is the gameplay has you getting an education and I'm so sick of school already.  It just goes to show you that games really are better than real life.  The main character is accepted into a school for alchemists and you control him as adjusts to life on campus, gets to know his classmates, does assignments and tests and has to earn grades and pass his class.  But it's still a game afterall so it's full of juicy RPG goodness with battling and team building and whatnot.  We'll see how I feel about it at the end of March.

I've realized that not only do I not want to be in school, but I don't want to work in advertising when I graduate.  I lost out on my first internship offer already and it made me even more sick of this damn business.  It was at Mediaduo over on Walker, three blocks from here and a perfect place for me to intern at.  I went in there at the top of their list based on resumes and I was apparently highly recommended by my teachers for some reason.  I started researching the place about four days prior to familiarize myself with their work, their current accounts and what they do in general.  And I took advice from my teachers and made sure I had some questions to ask so I would seem more interested in their business.  So after all these preparations ad getting all decked out in my best suit I walked on over there and sat down with a couple guys for a five minute interview.  No exaggerations, five fuck minutes.  I asked questions and answered the whole two they had for me and went on home.  The next day I found out there went with two other people in class.  You know why they didn't choose me?  Because I was a bit nervous and shy during the interview.

It pisses me off a bit.  It didn't matter how much I knew about them, or that I showed genuine interest in their work, or even that I was fully capable of doing the work.  I didn't go in there singing and fucking dancing so I didn't get it.  They figured that because I was a little timid that I wouldn't be able to handle the workload, even though they said it would be a lot of grunt work meant solely for interns.  This is what I hate most about this industry, everyone in a position of power is so ridiculously picky and takes everything people do so personally.  It doesn't matter how much more capable you are, if you don't go in there and kiss their dick you're gone.  They chose someone who usually doesn't do very good work, but who cares?  He had a better attitude and I practically went in there and shit in his sandwich because I was a little quiet.  I know this must seem like a gross exaggeration to all of you but this is really how it happens in advertising.  If you don't show the right attitude people just assume that you don't care about the company and won't do good work.  That's just not something I want to deal with my whole life.  The more I learn about it the less I want to do it.  One would ask then if perhaps the last five years of my life have been a complete waste.  I'd say no because when I finish I'll have a college education, a degree and something to fall back on.  I'm pretty sure I'll be looking into other fields for work though.  I don't mind grunt work, especially if my boss isn't a douche about stupid formalities like that."

"event","Gee, Len sure knows how to keep class interesting.  He gave us a twenty minute speech on how we need to show more passion in school and in our future careers.  He cited the fact that no one in the previous class had read a case we were asked to read and Wieland walked out on the spot.  I don't really want to get into that because while I do understand why she left, I also don't think that was the best way to handle the situation.  My hands are clean on this one anyway, the case is in a book I don't have.  It's our public relations text from semester five and since I didn't take that class at the same time as everyone else in class I have an older version of the book without the case.  So nuts to her.

I hate that Len just goes ahead and assumes that we lack the passion needed to work in this field.  It's hard to be passionate about being in school, I don't care who you are.  It's even worse for me, I've been there for five years, he doesn't realize how hard it is to be there for that long and still be excited about it.  It's different for him, it's his job, and we're all smart enough to know that we need to show that kind of spirit when we're working.  I know I can, I miss working.  I'm looking forward to having a real job again instead of some short term bullshit here and there.  I don't like having assumptions made of me like that though.  I have passion, just not for school.

I've started playing Puzzle Quest because I don't cherish life anymore and I'm looking for a way to end it.  This is a slower way of doing it but it gives me something colorful and shiny to look at while it happens.  Plus a friend at school just got a DS (and loves it more than anything) and Puzzle Quest and he wants to battle me.  He's put in so much time on it though that he's god-like in power on it so I need some time to prepare.  I'll let everyone know if this training kills me, and there's a good chance it might.  I'm still drained from the last time I played."

"event","Have you seen Rambo yet?  No?  Go hang yourself, your life is pretty pointless.  Seriously, Rambo kicked ass.  Not because it was a thought-provoking, meaningful film, but rather because he got pissed off and killed everything.  I am going on the record saying that this movie has <b><u>the best</b></u> senseless slaughtering I've ever seen.  Some movies do a good job at that.  Cannibal Holocaust comes to mind but this is better (maybe because it didn't involve so much rape).

The story and characters mean absolutely nothing here, except for John Rambo of course.  The story is just him bringing some missionaries to help out some villagers in Burma who are constantly attacked and murdered by a ruthless group of soldiers who literally play games with their lives.  When they go missing he's asked to bring some soldiers there for a rescue operation and ends up going along too.  This part was stupid because Rambo doesn't need help to take on 100 or so people.  Everything after that is just him stomping ass all over the place.  Rambo is an action icon of our generation and this movie has a way of getting your adrenaline pumping.  You know when you get there that it's mostly going to be him shooting and stabbing and blowing stuff up, but the fun of it is seeing how we goes about it, all the ways he can come up with to brutally murder a man.  It's like Snakes on a Plane, for anyone who appreciated that.  It brings out an almost primal instinct in you that craves excitement that doesn't make you think.  I won't say everyone should see Rambo because if you don't appreciate the movie then you won't shut up during the movie, like the teenagers sitting at the back of the theater that kept laughing and distracting me from all the awesomeness.  We don't need more of that.  However, Rambo is indeed an action movie icon and deserves a fair chance.  Like it or not, we need senseless action like this sometimes and it worked for me.

"event","I can't believe how nice everyone has been for my birthday.  First my excellent night out last week and now Sabo buys me a meal at Gilligan's.  I know I have great friends, probably the best friends I'll ever have, but I know I'm not that good a person.  You people must really have no standards.  Thanks again though everyone, I really appreciate it.  I owe you some nice gestures.

To repay Sabo I'm letting him star in my latest movie, Greyhounds at Midnight.  It's a horror concept I came up with earlier after remember he's a bit afraid of dogs.  It starts off in the dead of night with him waking up and looking out the window overlooking his front porch.  Out on his lawn he sees a group of greyhounds, seven or eight (whichever number is scarier), and they're all standing up on the hind legs like humans, perfectly balanced and unwavering.  They're just looking up at him with red, glowing eyes without making a sound.  Occasionally one or two will start walking around, maybe walking out from behind the house (still on their back legs) and then looking up to stare at him too.  For four hours the dogs just do shit around house while Sabo gets freaked out inside.  Sometimes they'll circle the house, or paw at the front door, or walk on the roof, or whatever.  They have no intention of hurting him, they're just there for some unexplained reason.  I'm not entirely sure why I chose greyhounds, I think just because they're the closest breed you can find that looks like little grey aliens with the big eyes.  I'm going to try to have it out by the end of the year but I may get bored and watch TV instead.  Stay tuned just in case.

I don't think that could end up any worse than any other movies out lately.  I have a question; how many 'dancing in the ghetto' movies do we need?  There's another one coming out now, How She Move, or some bullshit, and it looks exactly the same as Stomp the Yard, Save the Last Dance and all that crap.  Is this really necessary?  How different can it be?  And why do we need another Jason Biggs movies where he's awkward around girls?  Even though he's getting married in this one he's still as charmingly clumsy as ever?  Blow me!  Thank God Rambo is out this week.  That's just the kind of senseless action we need more of.  Rambo is an icon of the action genre, we are obliged to see this movie or else we'll miss out on something big.  But I really doubt missing out on 'dancin' in the hood' movie #37 will hurt anyone.  If you doubt how hardcore Rambo will be then take a look at this.  It's a death chart that compares how fucking hardcore this one is compared to the others.  This is why you should see it.

Sometimes I wonder if Youtube gives people too much power.

School is going well enough.  There's not a lot of work to do so far.  We had to submit our resumes so they can give us professional advice, we chose our preferences for internships, we've started on the semester's huge project and we have a short media report to write.  Not bad at all really.  I'm working with a great group this time too.  We're productive, everyone has input, everyone is open to ideas and opinions and we're all doing an equal share of the work.  I could get used to working under conditions like this.  For my internship I plan on staying in Windsor, hopefully getting into account management or public relations.  Whatever I can get, I'm not looking to leave town any time soon.  It's a crumby place but only because of the people I think.  If I can avoid all the people who make life around here worse then I'll be okay.  That means you, Dave.  You suck.

<b>Friday</b>

The last <b>DAY OFF!!!</b> of my college career


It's not a great schedule but it's not a bad one either.  This semester is pretty much all about getting ready for our internships and whatever jobs that will follow.  We do have to make another presentation, which means we'll be putting together another campaign that will showcase everything we've learned up to this point, but for the most part they will be helping us get ready for our future careers in advertising (assuming we choose to go into it), giving us career advice and helping us get our foot in the door, if you will.  I am still completely checked out though.  There are only three months of classes left before we go out on internships but I am so done with school right now.  I'm beyond that ""Oh, I need a break from school, I'm sick of waking up early.""  I don't mind waking up early and I don't mind working, I'm just tired of being educated and want it to be over.  I'll probably enjoy being done with school and establishing a career (as opposed to the shitty temporary jobs I've had before) more than I'm enjoying school just because it'll be a nice change of pace.  I'd still rather get a large sum of money, invest it wisely and never work again, but anything would be an improvement now.

I'm not really interested in working in a serious, professional advertising setting though.  I can't see myself going to work at an agency in Toronto.  Honestly, I don't think I can be as professional as I would need to be to get a great job in the field.  Some parts of it sound nice.  There are times when you may have nothing to work on for a whole week and other times when you'll be praying to God for a break.  That doesn't sound too bad, not much different from how I do things now.  And a lot of places aren't too casual so I probably won't have to walk around in a suit all day like a fucking business monkey.  But everything is taken so seriously and if you don't do simple things like write a 'thank you' letter after an interview or have the right sized resume you'll be ignored.  If you don't act just so you might as well get a job mixing concrete because you'll never get hired at any of these places.  Frankly, I'd be happy working on an assembly line for the rest of my life if I could live a comfortable life, and it would sure beat dealing with arrogant twats like that.  I figured out a backup plan though.  If I can't handle it I'll just fake going insane and get put in a mental asylum.  Then I get electro-shock whenever I want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon, it'd be a great life.

Anyway, this schedule isn't too definitive.  There are likely to be a lot of classes we aren't expected to go to because there isn't actually anything to teach us.  They'll want to meet with us from time to time and we may have to go in to hand something is or see a guest speaker or something but it's going to be more relaxed and flexible from the sounds of it.  So now you know, with knowing being quite important according to G.I. Joe.  Now, back to Generation of Chaos."

"event","The traditional St. Clair run-around has been a big part of my life for these last five years and yet again it's been my privilege to go through it again.  Just like last semester, St. Clair, in it's infinite wisdom, decided not to send me any registration papers.  Maybe they don't want me back and I'm just not getting the idea, I don't know.  So then the registration process began Wednesday.

1) I call the registrar's office to determine how much my tuition would be.  However, they couldn't give me that information over the phone.  Maybe some mad man has been going around paying people's tuition for them and they had to be more careful.

2) I immediately went down there in person to ask.  But for some reason, according to their systems, they weren't sure whether or not I was going back this semester, which explains why they didn't send me my papers.  As a result, I was not set up for any classes this semester, they didn't know what classes I needed and therefore couldn't tell me how much I would eventually owe them.

3) Time to go see Len.  I emailed him and he told me I could meet him either yesterday or today before noon.  I went yesterday and caught him just as he was about to leave and got the form I needed.

4) After finishing there I went straight down to the registrar's office to give them said form.  Chaos ensues as their systems go down and they can't access anything on their computers.  I dropped off the form anyway and got the amount for tuition.  They couldn't process anything at the time though so I had to trust them with it.

5) After going to the bank bright and early this morning to get a $1,200 money order I went back only to find their systems still down and out.  Today being my last day to register, I had no choice but to pay, even though they couldn't process anything or give me a receipt, and leave it to them.

Now as far as I know I'm all set for the semester.  I'm not worried about the money, i'm sure they'll work something out.  What I'm more worried about is being placed on academic probation.  The form Len gave me was one course coordinators use when re-admitting someone into a program.  All he wrote on it was that I was due to take all semester six courses and for them to make it happen, so hopefully somewhere down the road they'll sort that out.  They'd better, I have a 3.3 GPA, if I get put on academic probation because of their fuck-ups I'll torch the whole fucking school.  Anyway, I'll put up my schedule this weekend so everyone knows what I'll be up to.  It's not too bad either, I even get Fridays off.  A 9 a.m. start on Monday again is kind of a downer, but thems the breaks I guess.  Just four months to go.

I've been very into Aedis Eclipse: Generation of Chaos for the last few days and I don't really understand why so many people think it's so difficult to figure out.  There's a lot to it and it's challenging, but it's not the confusing and frustrating experience they make it sound like.  It's damn enjoyable so far.  The only problem I have with it is that it's pretty slow.  Everything takes time to load so the game moves a bit sluggish.  Big deal though, I have nowhere to go.  This is the kind of game you buy a PSP for.

So I'm completely broke right now thanks to that hideous bitch of a school.  If anyone wants to do anything in the near future that involves money don't be surprised if I have to pass.  Sabo, I know you were trying to get a hold of me earlier this week but the best I can manage to do right now is probably just playing N64 at your place.  Hang in there everyone, I know you can't go on without me, but try to."

"event","That was officially the longest, most aggravating Christmas ever.  You know why?  Because my sister is a hypochondriac.  Last month she got a flu shot and it really fucked with her, she was sick for a good three weeks because doctors are cocksuckers that can't be trusted.  This all led up to a few days ago when she had explosive diarrhea.  I'm allowed to talk about it because she's <i>my</i> sister and I hate her anyway.  I have no doubt she was sick, she called for someone to go over there and clean up her shitty clothes and sheets (Thank you God for not making me go) and it was quite a task I guess.  What bothered me is that she had to come here because she kept calling, half crying, saying she was scared.  So Pa had to go and do the right thing and invite her to stay over until she got better.  I can understand that, sometimes you just need someone to take care of you.  So I shuffled on over there to drive her over here and she insists on driving back, despite the fact that she's so sick.  Then yesterday she goes home for several hours to clean her already clean house and bring all of her kids' Christmas gifts over, implying she would stay for another day.  After helping her bring her twenty-odd presents she insists on going to visit our grandmother with me.  Hmmmm.  Then she came back here, got a good night's sleep, woke up by seven this morning and stay until just about an hour ago.  That's a hell of a lot of activity for someone who thought they might die.  And we had all the fun of watching her kids the whole time.  I hate sounding so bitter about having my niece and nephew over, I'm just not used to having kids around for so long.  We like to have a quiet, peaceful Christmas without any fuss around here and having them around really threw that off.  Oh well, it's over now.  My brother will be over tomorrow with his kids but at least I know he'll be gone at the end of the day.

On the Christmas side of the news, I'm happy with what I got.  A couple new shirts, a pair of jeans and some fine-ass games.

Final Fantasy 12: Revenant Wings = Pretty damn good and a worthwhile sequel to the PS2 game I love oh so very much.  It's a real-time strategy game that picks up immediately after the end of the first game and there's a lot to it so far.  It works a lot like Heroes of Mana, which I'm also working on, so I got right into it.  It tries to hang onto a lot of the same elements as the first one, with changes of course since it's an entirely different format.  Right now I'm just toying around with getting new units to summon and each character's skills.  I have high expectations so far.

Aedis Eclipse: Generation of Chaos = Hard to get used to but fun when you do.  There's so much micro-management in this game it's hard to keep track.  You start out in a world map setting where you proceed across panels through the area, similar to a board game.  But when you run into an enemy on the map with one of your units both sides go into this huge battle with as many as thirty individual units on each side and they just tear into each other until only one side is left.  And to add strategy to it all you have skills to manage, items and equipment to find, characters to recruit and train (or persuade to join in the event that you capture and enemy commander), and army management as you seize bases and protect you own.  It's a hard game but it's one of those ones that's so much fun to watch when you figure everything out.  Like Yggdra Union I guess.

SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Tactical Strike = Hardcore fucking awesome and probably the best PSP game to date.  You command a group of four soldiers from a country of your choice and lead them through various missions.  The thing is it's a strategy set-up as opposed to the usual first-person shooter.  You don't actually control the group(except for aiming and telling them where to move).  Instead you issue commands and they follow through with them.  Instead of pushing up on the analog stick and pushing X to knife a guy you point the cursor to where you want them to stand and when they get close enough you give them to command to knife the guy and they do it.  If you want to shoot at some guys from a distance you tell to the group to do it and wait until they take them down, moving if necessary, but you don't aim and fire yourself.  It's all about developing the strategy and letting a trained group of experts do the dirty work and it works so well.  There are countless ways to progress through a mission.  You can take down enemies any way you want, take multiple paths to reach your destination, use different weapons ranging from guns to grenade to smoke bombs, and along the way you can improve each team member to improve their attributes and make them better at aiming, stealth, or just give them more power.  The most important thing though it to use stealth and snipe enemies from a distance or stab them when they're not looking and avoid getting caught in constant shoot-outs.  There's something so satisfying about killing someone when they literally don't know what hit them.

So how was everyone else's Christmas?  Let's hear some status reports."

Not a bad bunch of marks if I do say so myself.  I'm not sure how I did that well but I think the work I did in the last month and a half helped a lot.  I was surprisingly efficient during that time and spent more time than usual on my homework.  My secret?  Death Note.  While I was working on my homework I took the time to finish watching Death Note online so while episodes were streaming I got some work done, watched the episode, loaded up a new one and worked more while I was waiting.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Now I wait patiently for a couple more weeks and get to the all-important final semester.  It was a long time coming but I'm finally in the home stretch."

"event","Did anyone else see all the snow out there?  There's this huge blizzard out there, there's almost a foot of snow out there.  Seriously, you should check it out, it's pretty cool.

A new Jackass movie will out on the 19th, but it'll only be online.  Paramount will be releasing the movie online and make it available for free streaming and then starting on the 26th you buy it on DVD or online.  This is a really interesting idea but I'm not sure how I feel about it.  Apparently Paramount is going to be doing this from time to time but I'm worried this might take part of the fun out of seeing a really good movie.  Half the fun is getting your friends together and going to see it and just having a grand ol' time.  It was a lot more fun seeing Jackass 2 in theaters with everyone than to just download it and watch it alone.  It's an interesting idea though, at least for some movies.  There are some cases where it's just downright unpleasant to have to go out to see a movie, like you don't care enough about it and you'd rather just watch it at home without all the hassle.  I guess we'll just have to see what it's like.

On the dark side of movie news we have a new American Pie movie, apparently focusing on a fraternity.  Wow.  They managed to take the same formula they've used in all the others and put it all in a fraternity where their hijinks will be even more stereotypical.  Do I even have to insult this movie?  You all know why this is wrong.  I'm making everyone a promise right now, if you see this movie I will pay for an afternoon of electroshock treatment for you out of my own pocket, just to get you back on track.  In the event that I can't afford electroshock treatment I'll just punch you in the cock (or if you're a woman, in the vagina).

I've accomplished everything I set out to do on Final Fantasy 12.  All I had left to do was take on the optional bosses and over the last few days I wrapped all that up.  The last two really took it out of me, they were endurance tests.  The first fight went by fast since the thing didn't have enough life to last too long considering the weapons and power I had,  but it hit like a truck.  With a high powered team with buff spells and all that good stuff going it can wipe out all six of your fights in half a minute at the most.  That took a pretty risky strategy but with some luck and good timing I pulled it off.  The second super-boss though was a fucking beast.  The fight lasted five hours, literally five total hours of gameplay to beat.  It's set up so that you can leave the area in the middle of the fight to go and save in case you want a break but I managed to do it without having to leave once.  It was a long, difficult fight that forced me to change my strategies several times but it was soooo much fun.  In any other game that would have been the worst thing ever, but when you can customize your own A.I. for each character and take out the busy work of going through menus and finding every individual action you want to make it's a lot more fun.  Truly one of the finest games ever made."

"event","Presentations went well today.  I don't think our group did a fantastic job or anything but we didn't get any complaints.  Actually, today made for some pretty funny times.  We almost couldn't believe one thing that happened while we were presenting actually.  We were about half-way through, in the middle of our media plan, when all of a sudden Len interrupts and says ""Wait, can I just stop you for a moment?!"".  We looked at each other with this look of terror and expected him to say something like ""I've had enough of this!  You're all wrong!""  We thought we were fucked but it turns out the people in the next room over (the cafeteria) were talking to loud and he could hear them through the wall.  So he goes over there and does...something, we don't know, we stayed in the room waiting for him to come back.  Then he comes back in, sits down and we continue.  We were just freaked out during those few seconds, messing up these presentations wouldn't look good on our marks at all.

A few other funny things happened here and there but mostly just stupid things that people did as part of their presentations.  That doesn't matter now, what does matter is that I'm done until January 7th and life just got a became a lot more simple again, at least for a little while."

"event","Just a few more days and I'm done school for another super semester.  I have an exam Monday, another Tuesday and our presentations are on Wednesday.  Then I'm done all you anxious people who can't wait to see me again.  Not that I'm terribly buys right now.  The bulk of my work that was left was due earlier in the week, now we're just working out how we'll present.  You know, who presents what topic, the order we'll put our information in, preparing the actual presentation, etc.  I have all the natural worries that should go along with something like this, but I keep telling myself that it'll be over by Wednesday at noon.  It doesn't really make me feel better though because we'll only have a few weeks off before having to go back and doing it all over again.  I'm just at the point in the semester where I'm completely sick of being in school and want to get it over with.  I want internships to start just because I know it has to be better than this.

I'm making a mental note to find some new people to work with next semester too.  For some reason this group has been having problems since day one.  We have someone who's completely commandeered the project and only includes what she thinks is right, a neurotic little man who obsesses and second-guesses everything we do and someone who has done absolutely nothing.  And I don't mean that in a joking, over-exaggerated way, she's literally done nothing and it's gotten on our last nerves.  I know there must be some people in that class who won't complicate things so much and I'm going to find them.

I got interrogated by a single mother earlier this week.  I wish I were making this up.  I know her through a friend and we've seen each other from time to time.  A few days ago she started asking me all kinds of questions about what I do, if I work/how much I earn, if I drive, where I live, and all this other stuff that I know she thought could be relevant to her if we dated.  Yes, I'm dead serious about this.  I know she's had a lot of trouble with guys before so she's probably taken to playing twenty questions with every new guy she meets to avoid any more problems.  I still have a hard time believing it myself, usually it's someone else letting me down when I'm interested in them, not the other way around.  Life's funny that way I guess.

Okay, so I'm around if anyone needs me.  Fat chance that anyone will need me though.  I don't have a hell of a lot to do so I could go for a quick outing during the next few days, but I'll be done Wednesday anyway so it'd probably be easier to wait for then."

Three weeks later here they are and the collection is complete.  While those were going I took the time to get two other pieces of M*A*S*H history; the movie and the 30th anniversary reunion special.  That's everything M*A*S*H-related I could have wanted.  There <i>are</i> the two spin-offs, After M*A*S*H and Walter, but not only do those not really capturing the same charm and spirit as the original show but they only lasted one season and one episode respectively.  I'm happy with this.  It wasn't even about enjoying a great show anymore, I had over two hundred episodes to enjoy.  It was a matter of honour and finishing what I set out to do.

"event","The focus group went pretty well.  We ended up with only five people but we got a lot of insight anyway.  My assistant, who was in the room with me at the time to take notes, is extra panicky that the information we got won't be good enough, but he's been doing that for everything lately so I choose to ignore it.  All we have to do now is fix up our ads for the presentations at the end of the semester and that'll pretty much be that for this project.  It's sinking in how close to the end of the semester we are now.  I'm not sure if I'm worried about next semester or if I just don't want to do so much work in the next few weeks but it's a strange feeling.  I'll look into it as I put off doing my homework for a little while longer.

I'm not sure what's going on with Len lately but I'm starting to think he may be a heroine addict.  The day of the focus group we had to miss his first class (the same time we conducted the focus group) but after we finished we were told that he never showed up to class and people left after waiting around for twenty minutes.  Then we go to his last class later that day and he doesn't show up again, no notifications or anything, which is weird because Len loves to email us.  He'll email us if a dog barks at him so you can certainly count on him to let us know if class canceled.  I can ignore that but the thing is he was in his office the whole time.  My assistant and I went to look for him after we finished the focus group and he was just sitting there chatting with someone.  Now, today he tells us that all of our classes are pretty much canceled for the week.  He'll still be around in case we need to talk to him but he's giving us work periods to get our abundance of assignments out of the way.  It's not that I don't appreciate it, that just means that I don't have to go back in until Friday.  I think he's as sick of being there as I am though.  He never gave us any reason for missing those classes and it's unusual for him to call off a whole week of his classes like that.  What do I care though?  At least I get to sit at home right now to think about it.

My innate ability to attract single mothers seems as strong as ever.  Can someone explain this to me, please?  Can someone tell me what it is about me that makes them like me?  Am I actually charming, just only to certain types of people?  Is it that they're just desperate for some kind of additional companionship?  Would I make a good father?  Help me solve the mystery."

"event","The only thing I hate more than having to work on a group project is having to take charge of one.  Len has assigned each group in the class to do conduct a focus group.  For anyone who isn't entirely clear what goes on in one, it's just where a representative from a company gets a bunch of random people together by offering $100 or something and getting their thoughts and opinions on a product, the category that product is in or the advertisements that company uses to promote it.  A moderator conducts the whole thing by asking questions presenting creative materials and getting all the information they can out of the group.  Guess who gets to do that for our group.  I was chosen because apparently I'm exceptional at presenting.  Said my group members earlier this week, ""he's non-threatening, un-intimidating, and good at being unbiased and professional.""  That's not all though.  Remember when I had to take part in those big presentations last year?  After our group was finished someone else in the group came up to me and, honest to God, shook my hand and thanked me, saying how happy she was with how I presented.  Not enough proof?  Recently I wrote a mid-term for my Marketing Cases class.  During said mid-term, at a point where I was going over my notes (open book mid-term) trying to think of an answer Len comes up to me, leans down and puts his hand on my shoulder as if to say ""You know what?  You're alright."" and says ""You did a very good job presenting yesterday.  Good work.""  He even gave me a thumbs up.  Forming a fist he aimed his thumb upward, toward the heavens, as people often do to express approval.

Anyway, I'm apparently the man for the job so I have to be the moderator for this focus group on Friday, which will involve me staying in a room for an hour for about six people asking them questions about a pre-paid credit card, which is what this whole project is about.  Honestly, I doubt I have what it takes for this because I don't entirely trust in my ability to keep my thoughts organized and ask the really important questions.  I kind of feel like I got a bit fucked on this one but everyone trusts me on this one.  I did this last year too, but Kuli moderated the group while I helped put together our report on our findings.  It might be worth the experience though.  One area of advertising involves account planning, which is basically gathering research (i.e. focus groups) and presenting that information to the creative team to develop campaigns.  Did you know that great account planners can earn over $100,000 a year?  In fact, if you're the best of the best of the best in this field you can earn as much $200,000 a year.  Obviously that takes a disgusting amount of work and a ridiculous amount of raw talent that I don't have, but knowing that something like that is possible makes you think when you're sitting in an account planning class trying to remember if you went to Wendy's twice yesterday.

They recently brought an anime called Death Note to American TV and I've been watching it.  At first it seems like predictable, excessively dark crap but it's turned out to be a lot better than I thought.  I usually geared toward more actiony anime but this is one of those ones that draws you in with intelligence and smart writing.  It's about a boy named Light who finds a notebook with the words ""Death Note"" written on it with these weird rules written in it.  According to the rules if you write a person's name in the book while picturing their face in your mind while you write it that person will die.  The writer can specify the exact details of the death and it'll all happen, providing it's within reason, but if you don't write anything the person will just die of a heart attack with no evidence of murder left.  After realizing what it can do Light gets this stupid idea in his head to rid the world of evil by killing everyone he sees as evil, like criminals, murderers, etc.  Meanwhile the authorities are investigating the deaths and trying to find someone who can't even be traced.

I've only seen a small portion of the series but what I'm really enjoying is Light's rivalry with L, an investigator employed by the police no one has ever seen or know the real identity of.  Both Light and L are incredibly intelligent.  Light continues to find ways of protecting his identity while he kills from the shadows and L continues to lure the killer into traps and pieces together his identity bit by bit, and very well I might add.  If L finds out that it's Light it's over and Light will be brought to justice, but if Light can learn L's real name and see his face just once he'll be able to kill him with the Death Note.  It's a surprisingly entertaining show, I would recommend it.  It's the first really well made anime I've seen in a long time besides the new season of Avatar."

"event","And Mike's as sick as he's been in a long time.  Apparently I'm very susceptible to the flu this year.  I was a bit sick earlier last week but it wasn't too bad, but on Thursday I got hit hard.  I was somewhat functional so I went to school, mostly because I had to for a group meeting about a major project.  In retrospect, biking to and from school in the cold might not have helped.  By that night I was out of commission and spent the next forty hours in bed.  It's surprising to me when I get that sick because, well, I'm never sick.  Before last week I had had a real flu in years.  And when I say a real flu I mean where you're vomiting, dizzy, sore all over, half-conscious and unable to move.  I get a little sick from time to time but just in a tired, lack of energy kind of way.  That's half the country on a Monday.  The last time I can remember having a real flu was about seven years ago when I actually blacked out at one point.  I'm just about better now, except for some severe nausea and being pretty drained.  It was a terrible few days but it still beats getting a flu shot.  I'd rather have a flu for a couple days and get it out of the way than have a cold for 365 days in place of a flu.

On a positive note Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker will be out next week.  This is the DS sequel the the Dragon Warrior Monster games I'm so hooked on and it's shaping up to be even better than the first two.  Two things disappoint me though.  First, the music still isn't very good.  I've never liked the music in the series and considering how much time I put into these games I'd like to enjoy having the sound turned up.  Second, although they added a fair amount of new monsters, they took out a lot of monsters from the first two games resulting in a little over 200 in this installment as opposed to over 300 in the second one.  But from what I've seen the good outweighs the bad.  It sounds a lot easier to convince monsters to join you for one thing.  Before there was just a percentage chance that one would join after you battle it and you could raise increase the odds by feeding it treats before you finish it off.  Now apparently you can scout out a monster once per battle and have all your monster focus on trying to get it to join.  Your monsters apparently attack at the selected enemy to fill up a gauge a certain percentage and the higher they fill it up the more likely it is the targeted monster will join you.  I like that.  Also, when breeding monsters (now called synthesizing, meaning monsters don't go off to have sex and leave an egg behind) you get a choice in multiple possible monsters that can be created from the original two.  I like that as well.  Plus it's all in a full 3-D world, every monster has complete battle animations and attacks in battle and the story will likely be more interesting with the improved graphics and characters.

I've noticed that since last year in this semester they've really increased the amount of work in each assignment compared to when I took the same classes last year.  There aren't any more actual assignments, just more work involved in each one.  But keeping with tradition they wanted until the last month to give us all the biggest ones at the same time.  I have six or seven things going on right now and it's keeping me from getting bed rest I sorely need.  I guess I wouldn't want to do it even if I were healthy though.  Right now I'm in the middle of a case about iPods vs. mobile phones in terms of the mobile music device industry.  This goes toward a big assignment I'm working on with someone due a week from tomorrow and to studying for a mid-term on Tuesday.  Then I have to prepare a presentation for Monday, read another case for the online discussion boards, work on the major group project and battle the flu in an on-going power struggle over my body.  Just like old times.

Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go force down a bowl of soup, drink a bottle of Pepto Bismol and throw up."

I wasn't going to bother because I don't need another site to socialize on where I never talk to anyone and I meet more people who have no real interest in talking to me.  But some good can come from this.  Since a lot of our material at school this semester deals with curent events we've been talking a lot and doing assignments concerning Facebook and I don't really know anything about what you can do with it or how easy it is to use.  So I guess it couldn't hurt to have an account, it's another way to stay in touch with friends (not that I need it) and I can get a few good marks out of it.  So find me on there.  Or don't."

"event","So I broke my toe.  I know, it's always something with me.  I stubbed it like you wouldn't believe last night on a chair leg and it must have bent weird or something because it seems pretty broken.  I can't really move it and it's swollen to the size of a grape.  I expect gift baskets delivered on a regular basis until my recovery.  And would it kill you people to bring me some damn ice cream!?

I'm having a hard time putting up with that girl in my group at school, the really bossy, obnoxious one.  I'm trying to avoid confrontations but she's really asking for it.  She gets on our cases when we don't get work done on, like, the day it's assigned because she doesn't have time to think about it later.  She has a couple kids at home, a husband to take care of and she publishes her own little children's magazine.  Apparently that's our problem and we're all there to make her life easier.  Who knew?  I can't put up with her nagging but she really needs to stop trying to throw that in our faces.  It's like when Len gets upset when we don't perform to his expectations because it reflects badly on the program.  Apparently we're also there to make the school look good, our education and how we decide to handle it comes in a distant second.  Fuck.

I solved my problem on Valkyrie Profile, you know where I was trying to decide between those two team members.  I decided to stick with the one who hits less often but is more badass over the one who fights very reliably and has less of a personality.  It was a tough adjustment but I found a way to make it work.  You see, the problem I was having was that this the badass (Suo) in the group as I attacked enemies they got pushed to the left edge of the screen with each attack.  Then when Suo got around to using his special attack it usually missed because it launches a series of icicles that fan out and start aiming off screen.  The enemy can't go off screen to continue taking the icicles that do so they dodged it.  So what I did was reorder his standard attacks that when he first starts attacking he does so from behind the enemy.  When I lead off with him he goes behind the enemy and attacks from there as the other fighters attack from the front.  This cancels out the enemy moving to the left by pinning it in between two teams of people.  Now by the time I start using everyones special attacks the enemy is in about the same place it was to begin with and every attack connects.  It other words, I am a FUCKING genius.  Fuck you Tri-Ace, you've got nothing on me!

I keep seeing commercials for birth control pills that encourage women to act recklessly and free-spirited.  It's always along the lines of ""Don't be afraid to try new things/be yourself/live every moment/etc.""  Is that really the message we should be sending teenagers and young women, that they can fuck up all they want as long as they have something to bail them out?  ""Don't be afraid to have unprotected sex, this pill will absolve you of consequences of your actions.""  Seriously, that should be the headline in their ads, and then show the girl getting out of bed with a homeless man with a smug look of self-satisfaction on her face as she takes out her pill.  They can disguise it behind freedom and being yourself all they want but there are enough girls out there making stupid decisions regarding sex without their encouragement."

"event","I'm now in day three of my five day weekend and it's going well.  I have no homework to think about, I have a bit of spending money in case I need to do anything and Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions will be out this week and I'm going to buy it and play it at school instead of doing work.

I want Eternal Sonata so bad right now.  It's an RPG out for the XBox 360, which makes me worry about myself a bit because I'm starting to feel the need to own a 360.  Unfortunately the hand full of games I'd like to play on it don't merit buying one unless I can get it dirt cheap so I'll just have to live without it for now.  It's a shame too, it's such a beautiful game with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard, plus a pretty unique battle system to boot.

I've probably tried (unsuccessfully) to describe Valkyrie Profile to people before.  Here's what it's like.

<lj-embed id=""15"" />

Being the obessive person I am I'm going through it again, only on hard mode.  It's not just for fun though, hard mode affords you certain benefits not available in other modes such as better equipment, more characters and access to more stuff in the bonus dungeon.  It's such a bitch though.  I've been toying around with my team the whole time because I keep recruiting people I want to train in my main party, but the problem is in hard mode everyone you recruit starts at level one and they don't really become worth using until at least level twenty.  I can live with that, but I keeping changing my team and it really throws things off.  Since attacks happen in real time and can hit or miss depending on where the enemy is standing or gets moved to getting used to each character's unique attacks patterns in a little hard.  I'm just choosing someone for the final position now and I've got it narrowed down to two choices but I can't decide who I like better.  There's Jun, who's a little more reliable in battle...

<lj-embed id=""16"" />

<lj-embed id=""17"" />

or Suo, who I just happen I like more as a character.

<lj-embed id=""18"" />

<lj-embed id=""19"" />

I want to train Suo but his special attack in the video there is usually unreliable and misses, and those special attacks are extremely important in ths game.  I'm going to try him out in a few areas and see how well he does against a variety of enemies but I'm leaning towards sticking with Jun right now because he integrates into my team so well.

Now I have nothing else to talk about.  Nothing all that special has happened lately, so since I'm in a Valkyrie Profile mood right now I'll just post more videos of some of my favorite characters.  Here are some recruitment scenes and special attacks.  Keep in mind that in this game you're recruiting the souls of fallen warriors to battle for the gods, so yes, they're supposed to die.

"event","I've been up for about half an hour now.  Do I seem bitter about it?  I just had one of those nights where I couldn't seem to fall asleep and stay asleep.  It's like your brain is done for the day but the rest of your body wants to keep moving.  Good thing I have to go to school for eight hours today.  That's certain to make me feel less sleepy and angry.

It's my mom 49th birthday today.  I'm sure we won't be having any grand celebrations, like where we leave the house.  My brother, sister, the old man and I all pitched in a bought her a really nice camera, but it wasn't my idea.  I'm not sure she'll be able to figure out how to use it.  I still need to help her get disks out of the DVD player.  If she can't comprehend 'Power-->Eject-->Eject-->Power' then all hope may be lost.

I'm starting to download movies again for my iPod.  I mentioned at some point before how when converting them to MP4s the audio goes way off synch and really ruins the whole movie.  Well I'm cutting out the middle man and downloading MP4s instead of AVIs or MPGs to be converted to MP4s.  I got Beavis and Butthead Do America last night and the audio is just fine.  So now I have Borat, Baseketball, Jackass 1 and 2, and Jet Li's Fearless downloading.  The only problem is finding decent torrents.  Most mp4 torrent I find aren't healthy enough to work, but this is still much better than watching a movie with an audio track that's twenty minutes off.

I've decided to start working on a Windsor board game.  Me and the gang have tossed this idea around before but I really want to make it now.  I'm not sure how I'll go forward with the actual production, I'm just thinking about the rules at this point.  What I'm thinking is have a square board that players have to move around and the objective is to get through Windsor by passing through four different areas.  Each side of the board is a different area and within each area the spaces are locations that we know from that area.  For example, the downtown area would have bars, the casino, the police station, etc., and if you land on one of these spaces something happens.  And then there's a type of space where if you land on it you have to draw an irony card and something unfortunate or ironic happens to you to screw you over.  Each player starts with $500 that can be spent or lost in a wide variety of ways and the first person to make it out of Windsor wins.  But if you run out of money you become a bum and are out of the game.  I'm still fine tuning everything but I could use some input from anyone who wants to get involved.  For lack of anything better to do, I'm going to work on this at school today.

And speaking of which I need to get going.  I'm going to go put on some pants."

"event","This is me hating Windows Live Messenger.  See?  See how much I hate it?  I know at least a few others were forced to upgrade to it, and by ""upgrade"" I mean downgrade, much in the way you upgrade from Windows Vista to XP.  I keep getting distracted by the latest celebrity bullshit news that I don't care about at the bottom of the window, and every time I open it up I have to re-enter my e-mail address and password, even when I tell it to remember both.  Instead of wasting time on useless things like this they should be working on moving sidewalks like on The Jetsons already.  This isn't the middle ages, we should have moving sidewalks.

I'm not sure, but I think I'm the only person left on Earth who doesn't use Facebook.  I'll have to run the numbers.  People keep adding me on there though.  I'm starting to realize just how big this is getting too.  I had to research it a bit for school the other day and there's a lot more to it than I thought.  I almost signed up just so I could have some insight into it for my assignment.  I wouldn't have thought it had such a massive user base or that investments in it have ranged from a few thousand to $500,000.  Even businesses are starting to make use of it.  But I'm staying out of it anyway.  Let everyone go to Facebook for their social networking needs, I refuse to sign up, shielded by my intense disinterest.

Do you remember that vacation center I applied at a couple months ago?  The one where I was told to expect a call back in a month?  Well I've gotten a couple calls back from them apparently.  I guess I can take the job if I want, but I can't.  They wanted people for full-time work and I can't work full-time now that school's started.  I may call them back and see if I can get shorter hours, but we'll see.  Does anyone else want the job?  I'm sure no one there remembers what I look like, someone could probably go in pretending to be me.  It was a pretty good job too, as far as telemarketing goes.  You just sit there in an air conditioned room calling people for $9 an hour.  Hours are pretty good too.  It'd be from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. during the week and I think 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday.  The offer is on the table is anyone is feeling lucky, or thinks they can do a good impression of me.

So get this:

That's right, they may have found a chupacabra, the mythical Mexican goat eater.  At first I'd be inclined to believe claims that it's simply a grey fox or some kind of dog with mange, but that wouldn't really explain why the thing only sucked the blood from those animals and didn't eat them.  Some people believe it may be a some kind of mutated dog, as though they feel better about that.  ""Don't worry, it's not a chupacabra, it's just a mutant.  Phew!""  And this is the Fox News pages, and according them they report and I decide.  So I've decided it's a chupacabra.  Case closed.  Thanks, Fox News, for your journalistic integrity.  I feel so empowered.

Good night last night.  We got in a casino buffet meal for $35 EACH!  That's rape!  It was $27 before, who the hell do they think they are!?  I like the casino buffet and all, but if they're going to jack up the price because they're including sea food that I didn't even eat then I'll take my business to the Chinese buffet from now on.  If I have some money to throw around and want a slightly better selection I'll go back to the casino, but I'm not that picky.  Of course, I would miss their fantastic dessert area.

Here's a sad fact; the most charming girl I've met in a several years now was a stripper at Leopards last night.  I got a dance from her and before it started we had a nice little discussion.  She talked about her past work experiences, which included Cheetahs and forklift operation, and then we discussed the declining economy of Windsor.  And she was quite insightful about it too.  It's a nice change of pace from the usual ""working my way through college"" shtick.  Hell,  got more out of the talk than the dance.  Most non-strippers I meet aren't that interesting to talk to.  Either that says something about how sad my life is getting or about the quality of girls I meet now.  I report, you decide.

All in all, I'm reasonably happy.  I met a charming young lady that I'll never have, Jay owes me $50, Sabo had his first beer in about four months, the new season of Avatar started yesterday, and I took yesterday of school.  Morale has improved and I'll be able to stay sane for a little while longer.  And once I get a small amount of homework done today I'm going to enjoy my weekend."

"event","today has been a good day, except for the fact that my girlfriend left for church at 4:30... and the fact that she's gone with her best friend (whom is in love with her) doesn't make it better... I've written her a note and let her know how I feel... hopefully she won't do anything drastic... and yeah, I love her to death... I can't wait till she comes home... but here's something that should boost my confidence... now remember this is on a 1-10 scale... xD

"event","so anyways today was a good day... nothin bad happend... nothin really good happend either... brittany and I talked again for a first ever since she's gotten her 'true buddies' back... really just her long friends... or whatever you wanna call 'em... it doesn't matter... it seems as if ever since she's gotten her friends back, I've been put on the back burner, or maybe back in the fridge... (I know that was gay, or stupid or something, but oh well... it's just an analogy)... but I guess that's what comes along with being someone who cares about practically everyone... no matter how thick it gets, whenever it's thin, you're forgotten... yeah life suck, but it still goes on (unfortunatly)... and also I can't go see elijah or carin today, because a) no gas, and b) I'm tutoring this kid in math... yeah yeah, I know what you're thinkin... 'but josh!! you suck at math!!'... yeah well that's trig... not 6th grade math... anyways... life sucks... see ya later... OH! and I also have this weird feeling that carin's not being honest with me... but then again I'm calling myself stupid for thinkin that... but then again I dunno... I'll talk to her sister about it... she seems like a realist... later"

"event","Today was an okay day... nothin really happend... the jazz band performed decently... I was told I sound awesome and like 5 trombones, all by myself... I passed Moson's Gov't class with an 85, got a 80 on his final, and I didn't even crack the notebook... somepeople took twice as long as I did and used their notebooks and still failed the final... I was shocked... but yeah... and about last but not least, I got hit buy a sudden state of depression, causing me to be mean to one of my friends... but then again, I wouldn't call her a friend... she's just kind of a person who now loves me for my baby, and comes to me with her problems and always talking about phillip... her b/f who loves in like augsta... or whatever.. I dunno I can't spell, thats why I'm here in high school... anyways, my depression was caused by the fact that I'm graduating in 2 months, and I have 2 friends whom I care about deeply, and after graduation I'm terribly afraid of losing them. therefor I don't want graduation to come... I just wanna stay in my senior year with my best friends and never leave their sides... or have them leave mine... but I figure it's ineveitable... so I might as well just suck it up and go oh with my life... that's what I do anyways... but yeah.. sleepiness kicks in, and the fact that I need to call Carin back... and I wanna wait for brittany to get on... I wanna talk to her and make sure she's doin good... 

adios, auf wiedersehen, chao!"

"event","<b>The Good Part of The Day</b>
I was at 6 flags from about 12:30 to about 5:35 today. I rode all the roller coasters that I could. Superman is great fun! anyways.. yeah I went there with like $100 and now I'm broker than broke... it's kinda sad...

<b>The Bad Part of The Day</b>
I come home and a good friend of mine is upset, it seems like all of her close friends have deserted her. she's been upset about this for a couple of weeks and I dunno what to do. she claims that noone cares, and I always return that comment with 'atleast I care' but that never seems to be enough. I understand where she's comming from and I also understand why that's not enough. those friends that have deserted her have been her best-of-friends for about 6 years. and all of a sudden this year they decide to form different little groups away from each other. they're all sophomores and it's normal for this kinda thing yo happe, but instead of finding another group, my friend wants her old group back. I understand why she wants this, it's a matter of comfort. I'm trying my best to make her happy and make her feel like she has atleast one person ther for her, but it still seems hopeless... =\... I dunno what to do... if you've got advice, help.. cuz I need it..."

so anyways to tell you about me, I'm Josh Weaver, and I'll be 18 in less than a week... kinda scary since I'm the youngest of 3 brothers. I can't believe it... I mean here's a sad but true list of things I'll be able to do

1) gamble
2) smoke
3) buy nudie movies
4) go into sex shops
5) go clubbin (at certian clubs)
6) go die for my country (after a draft)
7) vote (how convient)
8) drive after midnight (already do that)
etc., etc.

If I left anything off I'm sorry. but yeah... I also have a baby boy, who is 4 months old, 26 1/4"" long, and about 17 lbs. he's massive... anyways... that's enough... later"

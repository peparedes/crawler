"event","Ok so I realized that I have not wrote in my journal in quite awhile.  And I miss all your guys comments on my entries.  I have come to realize now that I will never have to go back to school.  Yeah it never really sunk in until now when I have nothing to do except for work, work, work, work.  And now Tess is probably working too because now that everyone else has a job, she thinks its cool to have a job.  Jk Tessa.  Anyways um I haven't got much to say.  Oh yes oh  that is all I have to say.  And yes I am a blonde like that so Tessa could you please tell me where I can find the password because I dont know what happened to that piece of paper.  Thanks.  Love always, the one and only marshmallow."

"event","Wow we are free!!!!!!!!!!!wahhooo.  This is like the first official day that i have to do nothing.  I just got up by the way.  Ok so wahoo I didn't trip on the way up to get my diploma.  I never thought that graduation would be so much fun.  I had a great time and I'm sure everyone else did.  Yeah then I had to do the whole family thing afterward, but really it was actually kinda fun.  Yeah got a few checks, from people i know this time, a few presents, some cake and had a great time.  I think it hasn't really set in yet that we are never going back to St. Bonnie.  Well im kinda sad cuz thats the last time our whole class will be together.  well catch yall later.  Not much to say.  love your one and only marshmallow."

"event","WOW! I never knew that one entry could have so much controversy.  Okay let me get down to business.  As for this ""ANNONYMOUS"" person who keeps telling me what I have already learned in Mrs. Macks wonderful Psychology class, I have news for you.  Ok you Pompous Prick (thanks kate)I am not schizo, I am simply a very random person.  You would of course not get any of the stuff I am saying because you are not my friend, never will be, and don't ever intend to meet you.  I will not stoop to YOUR level by telling you what narcotic disease you have by cutting and pasting off the internet.  I am real sure you know what you are talking about since I can cut and paste just like every other person with a computer.  And as for the voices thing, I have no voices just a very active brain that thinks of many things at one time.  It's nice to be able to think, im sorry that you dont have the pleasure to do so.  I have nothing more to say to you, maybe I will think of something later.  But as for now you have no genious penis so stop talking like you know what you are talking about, remember: ANYONE CAN CUT AND PASTE!!!!  
K im not bitchin, anymore.  Okay so i give advice to the fellow juniors! DONT OPEN YOUR MOUTH WHEN THERE IS CONFETTI AND SILLY STRING!  it tastes really bad.  k tess, that way way fun out there in the courtyard.  Yeah we are done nothing else, no more, we are freee.  Yeah!  ok so i really have nothing to say.  but i wanted to bitch and i didn't want to make a whole entry bitchy so yeah.  well i got all my pictures developed in the one hour photo and will be picking them up later.  you all will get to see them manana!  Ok wahooo only um 2 days til tessa's birthday.  well maybe i will write more later when there are better comments.

Luv ya all! -the one and only marshmallow"

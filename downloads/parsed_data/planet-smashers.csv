"event","woke up at 9... we got ready and ate then we left to go to fred howard to go jet skiing. we were there for maybe an hour and all the see weed was getting stuck in the engine so we left and went to dunedin causeway. it was alot better there and we were right by the people my dad and lori and mitch and dan and meg were by last week. i drove with my dad a bunch and went to some awesome island with mitch and dan and meg. it was really nice there! i sliced my toe open on some sharp rocks.. it hurt so bad! i walked along the shore with my step mom and we had a really nice talk.. just about everything that has happended lately and just tons of things. i never really knowticed how much she cared and how much she is there for me. then a little while later we went tubbing! i fell out once and i could touch the bottom. i felt really gay just floating in the ocean waiting there. i think for fathers day were taking the jet skiis out and im gonna ask to borrow bob and sallys wake board.. it will be tight! but we came home and clened the skiis, swam for a while, then chilled on the patio. i came on for a bit and then we planed on going to the movies tonight, we ate dinner and did dishes. now were wating on my step mom to get outta the shower.. speaking of i need to change to. im going to see shrek 2.. i think meg dan and mitch are seeing garfiled and my dad step mom and i are seeing shrek 2.. well ill write later. paycee"

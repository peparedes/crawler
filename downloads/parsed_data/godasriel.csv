"event","I have just come to the realization after six years that hanging lites has to be one of the most uncomfortable activities known to man. 

1 Insturments arent ""light"" but they arent quite ""heavy"".
2 The insturment cords are always just long enough to snag on something. 
3 You pretty much have to climb up and down the ladder at least twice to hang a given insturment. 
4 Bolts have sharp edges, 
5 yokes were not meant to be handles, You think you can carry two just fine and then your hand starts cursing at you when the yokes pinch the flesh of your palm.
6 Everythings rough, or rusty, or both.
7 One cable is light, 3 cables is heavy, 5 cables can weigh 50 pounds, try holding that up with one hand and trying to tie a half hitch with the other.
8 The clamp bolts are not placed in a very ""comfortable"" position, they are at an odd angle, and if the clamp is facing towards you you can hardly get any decent leverage, and if it is facing away from you it's a bitch to try to bend your arm around the insturment to get the wrench on it.
9 every year they come out with a new ""Safer"" C-Clamp design; I don't give a fuck if they're ""Safer"" all they are to me is MORE OF AN UNGODLY WHORE PAIN IN THE ASS TO GET OFF THE GODDAMN BAR.
10 1 1/2"" pipe is the devil, I dont care if it holds more.
11 I you're ever hungry during intermession feel free to crack open an egg on the top of one of the fresnels, even at half power, it'll be done in notime flat. (AKA focusing = Burning Pain) oh, and that burning smell that pops up about a half hour in, dont worry, it's just the dust.
12 gel frames are always bent, the gels newer want to go in right, the frames never want to go into the holders, and the holder clips are always stuck.
13 Acrobatic acts performed on a ladder can be mentally exhausting, Don't even think of telling me to move the ladder, I am not getting down and moving the ladder to reach three goddamn inches. when I'm asleep my knees will detach themselvs from my body, come to your house (or rehearsal) and knee you to death. my mind will recover, my knees won't (neither will you)

all in all it might even be as uncomfortable as...   well, nevermind."

"event","Thank you to all who came to the party, you all made it an excellent time.

I think the difinative image from that party that I will never forget has to be Miss Bluepants, in her prom dress, firing the double barrel shotgun, then lifting it over her head and yelling ""I Rule!"" after blowing up a milk jug. that was the shit. We fucked up that bleach bottle good. Thank you to eric and ken for letting us shoot their guns, that M1 garand rocked, and I'm going to have to get myself my own double barrel 12 guage now.

Thank you to Jeremiah for the not dying present. It is most appreciated. 

speaking of not dying, the soreness from the not dying really kicked in yesterday at the wedding (jews, lot's of jews, jews EVERYWHERE, Kletzmer Music, Fuck Yeah!). Imagine (if you have to) every single muscle in your entire body and I mean every one, feeling like you'd just run 10 miles with no prep. I had to whip out lucius in the middle of the wedding (kind of embarrasing) and it became an ordeal just to move my fork for lunch. Painkillers didn't help much either. so don't flip your car over kids. 

my cell-phone got wet from the hot tub, for a while the display was upside down and color shifted to be almost inverted. now it seems to be fine though, I was kinda hoping it would stay color shifted.

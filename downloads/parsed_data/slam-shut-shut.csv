"event","<font size=""1""><b>This tutorial will teach you how to make brushes..woo!</b><br /><lj-cut text=""Click of Tutoril""><font>&lt;1&gt; Start with a base and put what ever sort of pattern/design you would like. For mine I was making a brush that looked like so:<br /><img src=""http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t127/BallroomBlitz_x/photos/Graphics/Tutorials/MakeingBrushes/083e55d1.png"" alt="""" /><br />&lt;2&gt; To make the brush s you can use it again, go to Edit - Define Brush. This will make your pattern into a temporary brush.<br /><img src=""http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t127/BallroomBlitz_x/photos/Graphics/Tutorials/MakeingBrushes/afb6191b.png"" alt="""" /><br />So after you have accumulated a few of the patterns/shapes/whatever's together you would want to save them. In-case of Photoshop meltdown, or you want to share them with others. <br /> To start the saving process you would do the following;<br /><br />&lt;3&gt; Open your brush selector. Click the white button thing with the arrow. And go down to 'Preset Manager'<br /><img src=""http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t127/BallroomBlitz_x/photos/Graphics/Tutorials/MakeingBrushes/537f3481.png"" alt="""" /><br /><br />&lt;4&gt; Once the Manager opens you can click on the first brush of the set you where just making and want to save. [In the example I selected some NHL Team Brushes that I made earlier as well]Once you cliked on the first brush hold down Ctrl and the Right Arrow key to select the rest of the set. <br /><br />&lt;5&gt; After your brushes have been selected, click on Save Set.<br /><img src=""http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t127/BallroomBlitz_x/photos/Graphics/Tutorials/MakeingBrushes/7a7d9396.png"" alt="""" /><br /><br />&lt;6&gt; The last step is pretty much self-explanatory.<br /><img src=""http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t127/BallroomBlitz_x/photos/Graphics/Tutorials/MakeingBrushes/c574452b.png"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Hope this made sense &gt;_&gt;'<br /><br /><b>You can like..comment or something if you don't get it but chances are, I can't help.</b></font></lj-cut></font>"

"event","So, today. I woke up. Late. Ate breakfast. Cold. Walked to the bus stop. Even Colder. The weather man said that it was supposed to be like yesterday. But it wasn't. So, today I stayed remotely warm. then I got to school and the railing for the stairs was broken. like, broken off the wall. so everyone kept trying to grab a non-existent railing all day. K, I like laughed my ass off when ever someone like, lurched over and picked them selves up acting like nothing happened. 

Well first I had Spanish. Well. I had the class but I was reading most of the class. But I still marked everything I had to, and I wrote the ""poem"" we had to write. It was..well the lamest thing I've ever done in a language class. 

Then I had PE. And I got lost running laps. K. rly. I did. Then we played the best game of Capture the flag <u>ever</u> We lost but, what ever. It was fun. 

Oh boi, Science was next. Spitballs. Oh, How I hate them. especially the people on the other side of them. I think all the guys in our classes will never grow up. rly. Oh, David is moving, So that's a good thing. God How i can't stand him. He expects other people to do his work. so yeah. only 3 more weeks...he's the 3rd person that will be leaving my life in January. ._. yay. all the people around me are dropping like flies. 

Well then In hum, My teacher has less than 5 weeks still being our teacher. I'm going to get him something for Christmas...I just don't know what. I dunno, Probably something like...a coffee mug or something cuz...he REALLY likes his coffee...

Then I came home. I ran quickly so I a) wouldn't freeze to death and b) so I could watch TLE on Jimmy Kimmel. But Channel 68 lied to me and they didn't replay last nights episode so I missed it ;_;

Well. my ass is starting to hurt and I'm getting dizzy. Night."

"event","OMG K. the wind today when I was waiting for the bus this morning was <u>brutal</u>  Really. If I weighed 30 less, I would of fallen over. I was being tossed around now. And my hair was all nice and straight this morning and by the time I got on the bus it looked like I was in a Bar fight and then a wet T-Shirt contest.  [wow @ weird simile] But it was kinda funny in the end really. Because...well it just was. idk why. 
Then I had computers. I must admit, it was the <u>best</u> computer class I ever had. The teacher has this thing that shows her where everyone is and was on the computers and she was using the over head projector thingy that is attached to her computer and so she kept opening that window so we could all see what everyone was doing. I was caught being on GSB :shifty: but I was only there to answer Aleckz's PM I swear. :omgno: LMFAO LMFAO LMFAOLMFAOLMFAO K. So I just finished typing that sentence and Aleckz replied. k. Back to computer class...or not because I think I finished babbling about it. K, so next I had math and a Math test...The test was simple o_O Like really simple. And then Me, Brittney, Danielle and that other girl (she's quite and I keep forgetting her name T__T) had art. Art is always fun. srly. I could spend all day typing out all the little perverted jokes we tell to each other and the little puns and other stuff we say, So I won't type them. but yah. I don't think I can ever come out of there without a stomach ache.
 
K, So then at lunch I went and hung out in the library again...like every other freakin' day and signed out this book. It had like 78 pages and by the end of lunch and the 25 minutes of silent reading we do, I was done. It was a lame book anyway. =|

K, So Jay wants the computer.

Bye nuckas."

"event","lol. ily Robbie...but like..not in that way. 

Woo. on with my day..So I had Spanish with the teacher that can't speak Spanish. It's actually kinda fun because for the first 20 minutes, we do nothing. then we mark our homework and then do some simple worksheet. then I'm done that quickly so I have like..another 15-20 mintues left to do something. yeah. So then in PE we had a beep test and I really hate them. So I made a deal taht I could <u>only</u> stop once I got to 40, and I ended up getting 46 :tehe: Lauren got 120+ so.. <img src=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i114/color_me_stupid123/Smilies/T_T.png""> well. I hate to run. so. yeah. it all worked out. Hum we learned about like...Grammar and stuff again..yippie. -_-


So that was basically my day..not too exciting. o okay. so, I have a 3 mintue story my hum teacher told me..

<font size=""1""><center><i>So, he was in a band. And they where on the road. [woo @ simple sentences] and 
they where kinda drunk and the band was talking with a rodie like person. 
And so they kept trying to trick the rodie guy into beliving that girls didn't go to the bathroom.
 and by the end of the night the rodie belived my teacher and the band.</i></center>"

"event","Well. So my favorite teacher of like all time is leaving our school. well more like anything I think he got fired. But he just wants to break it easy to us. Rly, He is <b>the</b> smartest person I know. Yes, that includes Dujo. <img src=""http://www.geekstinkbreath.net/board/images/smiles/file.gif"">  He's the only person that has ever gotten interested with philosophy and history and current events and shit. really. I'm gonna miss him.

T__T January is gonna suck.

K, So..euh. Tomorrow I have Spanish class with a teacher that can't speak Spanish to_o Yeah..fun..I have PE. PE is remotely fun. I think we're playing dodge ball. I also think the boys are out the change room so they can stop staring at us while we run around and stuff. lol. I can't wait till January when we can stare at them..K, One of them is pretty nice looking. rly. he is. 

Euh. I went to the library at lunch today...again. And it was half dark so Aryanna was saying that the ""Bookie Monster"" will come out.  And then I was gonna say something and it came out like 50 decibels higher than I wanted it to so I squeaked. ya. so.

"event","K. yeah, I'm in computer class right now. I guess the teacher is learning something about us because she learned that we all hated the class and really hated her. So she's going through all the questions with us now! (: Yay! So I have a smile on my face, in computer class. stfu it's a big thing. 

So, I have math next..It's not that bad except that I forgot to do my homework cuz I was on GSB and INO all weekend..but that's nothing new =| I'm surprized that I'm not failing. 

Well. so..it's 9:04am, I've been up for 3 and a half hours. I don't know why I keep waking up so early. I also keep having dreams that I'm being forced to learn frech and always speek it. I hate French (Sorry Cecilia) So, i dunno. I had this dream before that I had to learn English in China. =| I have weird dreams...well dreams about learning new languages are better than dreams about having cancer I guess..

LOL. Scott's stupid. He was reading this behind me and he asked what my username was, he's like, ""Sara, what the hell, is your username, Slam underscore Slut underscore Slut?""  Yes Scott. It's that. [insert :pat: smilie]

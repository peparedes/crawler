"event","SO i like this guy, well he isn't a guy, he is my friend but, he is a guy and I like him, but anyway. I haven't been in  a relationship for so long that i honestly don't know how to act sometimes. I dunno what is it, or if there is just something about him that causes me to act crazy, but it is what it is. I find myself on tie out 2 days in a row, and the second time it being partly, mostly my fault, but his too...I dunno..........i just can't take anymore of this.......My friends say we need to go ahead and f@#^, some think that we have.......We have not, we haven't even held hands lol. He probably thinks that i don't like him...maybe that is what it is....Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

Can someone help"

"event","Okay, i had begun reading the new Gillian Anderson article but i got really choked up, so i stopped and watched the rest of TMC, that happened to be on tv, and now i've just finished reading. I have to say that my respect level and admiration for Gillian has just increased 10 fold.

I can not imagine what I would do if what happen to her happen to me. She is such a strong person, more than probably I can't even fathom. It really hurts me now more, knowing what she went through, with what the tabloids and dirty press were saying about her. You know one never knows what is going on in some one's life and to speculate like they did was totally uncalled for and inappropriate. I hope that this interviewed and relied over here to the US, because i think a lot of people are interested in knowing what has been going on with her and how she is doing, in a positive way.

I think I'll never look at Gillian the same way tomorrow as I did yesterday, there is just so much there and I think so much more that she has left to do and left to show and tell us.
There are many reason's why Gillian is my favorite actress, bu there are even more as to why she is one of my favorite personalities."

Well Gillian Anderson didn't win the Golden Globe, but she has a lot left in her.
I'm starting a new job in 2 weeks.
It is finally cold here in the great state of New Jersey.

I guess that is about it,"

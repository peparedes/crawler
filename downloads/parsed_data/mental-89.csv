I still, till now cant do a figure of 8 properly XD keep having trouble knotting safety line. Belaying's waaaaaaay easier.<br /><br />Was doing my first route when my sister suddenly told me she wanted to tell me something. and i was like hmm maybe my butt looks ugly or something up hanging in the air. turns out that all she wanted to tell me that, that black clothed dude that just came in was Taufik... I was like er. okay.. intresting. Anyway, i didnt climb much. or rather i didnt finish many routes. lol. out of the dunno how many i tried only managed to complete two XD&nbsp;hand/arms damn tired. even till now i cant grip something properly. seems to take alot of strenght, which i dont have at the moment. after when Rudy and i got so shagged. Went into boulder area to watch my sister and her friends. apparently she hurt her shoulder and ankle.. again...<br /><br />Sigh. Just the second night that he's gone. they're having some crap conversation. Which i dont want to be involved in. and seriously hope they DONT THINK about getting me involved.

"event","It's been ten long years since Harry Potter has been released. and the final book is out. what a long wait. been reading the book since i got home from Fun on Foot today. quite tired atm. I must say that it was something i really never expected. but quite satisfied with the ending. :)

still remember that outta my entire series. I didnt actually buy all my books at all. I got my first three free in a boxed set fro Chai Hoon Jiejie for christmas one year. and at that time i was still in primary school. wondering - but not bothering to find out, why everyone was so crazy over Harry Potter. it wasnt till one day i really got so freaking bored i decided to open the first book. if i wasnt wrong i actually found the first book to be draggy. Might be due to the fact that i actually wasnt really intrested in the book. but was just something i was reading just to pass my time due to boredom. was only after that - than i got hooked on it. So i give my thanks. to the one who introduced me to the world of Harry Potter :D

okay. i better go. apparently more tired than i think i am.. gonna sleep. urgh. now that i've gotten HP7 outta the way. its time i get my c.maths back into pespective. first test next wed. Yikes better make a note somewhere. and sheesh did i mention my power supply unit died on me? Gah!"

I do remember that the last time it was only me and jie though. Parents werent with us. i think i remember getting spooked about something. and i did go for a midnight cycling around. i think there were kitten's too. hmm.. <br /><br />anyway. went to Pk's chalet yesterday. Met up with bunch of em. Benson, June, Wanting, Si Xiu, Teck Kiat, Terence, Jun Hong, <strike>Agnus</strike> Agnes &gt;.&lt;, and duh.. Lene of cuz. So many people. than me June and Benson found corners to hide in. Heh. Had fun talkin to em. fooling around together once again just for a day. Watched my first F1 race. Drank my first non-dialuted er alcohol - not that i actually drink. (glad that i didnt get drunk - since i drank it by accident &gt;.&gt;) psst. Pk's such a weird sleeper :X imagine 4 of us accomadating to her just cuz she was sleeping in some funny place. Haha. Five girls sharing&nbsp;two single beds. another 3 people on the floor. and i think 6 people tonning outside yaking away. fell asleep towards the ending of F1. got woken up again after it was finished. since Wt and Daph was trying to figure out how to squeeze in the bed. Which we just ended up sleeping with half our bodies dangling off the end. Damn cold. wonder who's idea it was to have the fan and aircon on at the same time. went for breakkie at mac. ah dang. havent eaten mac breakfast in soooooooooo long. damn full now too. took some photos. watched abit of tv. some lame cartoon and Ellennnn. She has a hunted nose XD finally decided to get my lazy ass outta there. haha! was so late by than lah. Left with Terence and Agnus. couldnt make up my mind if i was gonna go back for steamboat later.&nbsp; <br /><br />Urgh. You know what? thought i didnt stay up. (like how i said i most prob would) i'm still tired &gt;.&gt; maybe that's a mental thingy. hmm. i'd know what it is anyway if i do really fall asleep&nbsp;later :P but for now. got some lame presentation that i've to go&nbsp;through -_- meh.&nbsp;"

school's been okay. finally made our year two selection. still have time to change our minds until coming friday. lol. decided to pick networking in the end. aha but if you ask me for a reason i wouldnt be able to tell ya one. heh. anyway if i seriously suck that badly at networking i'll be pushed to multimedia in the end. -_- but really trying to maintain my current grade. sigh. but in my mind currently i think i cant make it lah. not only for nwt but for cms also lol. could be due to the *ehem* teachers and my intrest in it lor. glad that the postponed presentation allows me to *ehem* skip abit (hopefully more) of my cms lesson heh. if only i can do that for like another uhm three more weeks? than i think the term is up *yay* =X prob get nagged at if someone sees this lol.

"event","<strong>Sagittarius Personality</strong> <br />Bold, dashing and spirited. It's a bit difficult to keep pace with you - whether it is in your movements or in your speech. You like to be free as the wind that blows, quite uncaring of the effect you may have on your surroundings. You could not care less and hate being in an atmosphere that is physically or emotionally claustrophobic. Somewhat lacking in tact, your foot-in-the-mouth syndrome could do with a little thought. Nevertheless, you are honest but more than a little tactless. Sagittarians are ambitious - always aiming higher than the goal they initially set for themselves. You love challenges and are too full of energy to sit still. Although you see yourself more as a sportsperson than an intellectual, you secretly enjoy reading, writing, and exploring subjects unknown to you. You are a good learner and would do extremely well as an academician. You are quite popular, albeit a bit unconventional and are loyal to your friends. Many of you enjoy the patronage of influential people but unfortunately; you will also have your share of enemies who mean serious harm. You are often driven by excitement and can be a bit ungainly when in this state; sweeping gestures tend to send things flying. You are sometimes insecure and edgy. You tend to doubt your decisions and judgement. The advice is - trust your instinct. Avoid going by what people tell you if you want to succeed in your work. A word of caution though -- your instincts may not work too well when you are betting, gambling and speculating, and you may end up losing heavily. <br /><br /><strong>Sagittarius Lover</strong> <br />Although affectionate and loving, Sagittarians are not apt to be too demonstrative. Not much cuddling, showering of gifts, or saying it with roses - something that may be misconstrued as lack of warmth. However, you will make it exciting enough for your beloved. Bungee jumping, mountain climbing, horse riding, going to exotic destinations... all this you will do with your partner. Besides fellow Sagittarians, you will find ideal life partners in Aries and Leo, being closer to your temperament than any other zodiac sign, only they will be able to share your excitement. Marriage with someone who is not able to keep up with your pace may be a failure, so make sure the person cuddling up tight in your roller coaster life is screaming in fun and not fear. You are a loving and playful person and though you are not prepared for children, you make a good parent; you use your enormous patience while dealing with them, giving them the respect they deserve. You are a risk-taker and are often attracted to danger. You should exercise caution as your family depends on you. Sagittarian homes have a distinct mark of their personality. Simply lifting ideas from elsewhere will not do for them -- they like to be a little different. <br /><br /><strong>Sagittarius Professional</strong> <br />You will do well in most occupations that require you to be outdoors. You make good sporting people. You will also succeed as teachers, lawyers, and politicians. Business and banking too are good for you. If you find your work tedious, it is simply a signal for you change to something more exciting. Jupiter, the symbol of good fortune, riches, and status, rules you. Although you will achieve most of this, it will be rather late in life. In fact, up to the age of 30, you are likely to suffer financial setbacks, mostly because of your tendency to be rash. However, you learn well from your mistakes and these monetary setbacks are not going to upset you too much. In fact, even when you are well settled financially, you will not particularly crave for landed property and assets. <br /><br /><strong>Sagittarius Traveller</strong> <br />You dislike going for a peaceful quiet holiday away from the hustle-bustle. The idea is to have fun and frolic on holidays rather than lying with a book. You are born travelers so if possible would visit all the places given in a tourist book. You are open to having a trekking and camping holiday. <br /><br /><strong>Sagittarius Teens</strong> <br />This is a young woman you can always count on, and most of the times, she is fun to be with. The Sagittarius girl never lacks company; she is bubbling with energy and ready to explore any thing. She certainly has the gift of the gab but her tendency to blurt out whatever's on her mind can land her in a mess. People around won't understand that she is simply being honest. If she finds something interesting she will simply go for it. She is not the kind to spend long hours in front of the mirror and happily shares her wardrobe with other girls. The young Sagittarius will excel at school and is likely to travel to another country for higher studies. <br /><br />A Sagittarian young man is steeped in the spirit of adventure and loves to roam the world more than anything else. He dreams on a grand scale. And what is interesting -- this has a good chance of coming true! He has a fiercely independent spirit and finds it really hard to commit himself to anything. The best thing about him is that he is open to all kinds of ideas and this wins him a lot of friends, and lovers as well. Another reason for his popularity is his carefree, fun loving nature, and the enormous generosity that he bestows on his friends. He has a lot of energy bottled up and sports provide just one outlet. The Sagittarian will spend his life chasing wild dreams <br /><br /><br /><strong>Sagittarius Kids</strong> <br />A happy-go-lucky kid, the Sagittarius child needs to travel all over the place and enjoy his or her freedom to the fullest. Characterised by a positive attitude to life and high energy levels, this kid gets naturally attracted to sports and has an open mind and easily mingles with a diverse group of friends, mindful of being fair and just to all of them. The Sagittarius kid is very talkative but his or her brand of candour can often spell trouble, which is of course cheerfully overlooked by most people. <br /><br /><strong>Sagittarius Well Being</strong> <br />Sagittarians are fun loving, carefree individuals who live life to the fullest. As a result, they generally do not suffer from stress-related problems. However, most Sagittarians tend to take everything very casually, including their health. They rarely, if ever, visit a doctor, because they seldom require to. Sagittarians are the most daring and audacious of all the signs of the zodiac. They are always ready to try-out a new sport or adventure. The only problem is that Sagittarians are prone to minor strains, sprains and injuries. You will have to learn to take it easy and learn to do warm up's etc before putting your body through heavy exercises. Also, give yourself enough time to heal before embarking on any new escapades. A good diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products should keep you on an even keel, with the occasional time out to rest and relax. A good complexion, shining eyes and a prominent nose are your distinctive features. Some of you may, however, suffer from nervous disorders. Sagittarius rules the motor functions and the lower limbs that in some cases may be vulnerable to injury. <br /><br /><strong>Sagittarius Luck</strong> <br />Autumn colours like yellow, bright orange and rust browns, turquoise and a splash of purple are colours that will bring you good luck. Your lucky stones is turquoise. You are lucky with number 3. Jupiter is your ruler and your element is fire."

LOL walaoeh. cuz after she ate we went to campus heaven cuz she said she wanted to STUDY! -sniggers (yeayea sure)- than cuz i asked her to buy cookie for me. than i told her to hurry it was then that she started her crazy talking. talked about herself as a third party 

her: spy going to buy cookie now. 
me: uh why must you bring your bag along. 
her: spy say cold so must bring ( so diao lor -_-) 
me: uh okay (she walks off) 

after that we went back to cafe1 cuz her classmates were gonna join her after their class. 

saw misswong asked her over intro-ed and she went to buy her food. 

her: spy wants to study. but where is spy's book. 
me: uh since when you got study one? 
her: spy have been studying okay. spy studied last night till six in the mornin (i have no idea if its true cuz i was being a normal human being and sleeping at that time.)

me: i dont care what spy want spy say anything i buy anything. 

hahahaha. so stupid lor than she went on and on after that saying how retarded she felt and the best part was that she didnt stop it! LOL still continued sia. 

i left her awhile after that got darn class and assignment. class was crazy today. hahahaha! i tell you. treated her so bad :X first she went through the trouble of going through normalisation again for everyone and than the class kept saying no when she asked if we understood. than second she gave us break and went to print the assignment paper (last min) for us. and than when she came back. papers given out. sat by register numbers. everyone settled down. we all went crazy when she realised that the paper she gave us was NEXT week's assignment which was assignment 4 lah. hahaha! so she quickly collected papers back while the class was chanting for her to postpone the assignment. than she showed us assignment3 via front screen and everyone was like cannot see cannot see. than she zoom into qns1 than some uhm people (ehem must be polite to my classmates. ha!) said cher i wanna do qns 2 first. while another obviously said i wanna do qns3 first. gaha! than everyone was like postpone again while she bo pian walked all the way from the B blk to the T blk to her staffroom once again just to print papers for us &gt;.&lt; 

sometimes i wonder how she feels. yea i know though there might be a smile on her face when she faces us. what is she truely thinking? does she dread facing my class? i know sometimes i join in sassing teachers but i dont do it to that extreme. i feel bad. so half the time i'll just be watching what they do or i'll just be laughing at what stupid antics they come up with. whoever who said teachers got it easy just cuz they could ""rest"" cuz they had more holidays than the other workers dont know what they have to go through sometimes. besides the fact that students sass teachers nowadays (where's the basic respect that every elder should deserve?), they also have to endure students that come late for class, sleep/talk in class, being super sarcastic to them and&nbsp;not forgetting&nbsp;getting scolded (valguarities) &nbsp;in hundred and one languages. 

and now i shall do the thing i do best. that's to contridict myself. whatever mentioned above was just thoughts. ahhahaha in no way am i going to stop going late for class cuz that would mean i have to wake up early &gt;.&lt; . (i only can say to try not be SO late like pass the 15mins grace in school) 

anyway i must say after all the hooha the assignment was a killer. urgh. i doubt i'll be getting any marks for qns3 kept staring at the paper. felt so tempted to bite my fingernails (but i didnt lah xD still have my thinny wennie nails which i keep playing with nowadays) while pondering about the damn assignment. urgh. everyone left so early sia. hahaha. wonder how they really did actually. adam was commenting how this could be a test that we all have to resit for. haha thats if they actually practise that in ite lols. 

went for short innovate it meeting with adam after that. ahha! cuz he went to toliet first i think than me xinying and xuelian was left in the COT (center of technology COT for short) than cuz we actually dont wanna have meeting lah. so we being cheeky kids decided to play hide and seek with adam ahha! went to hide at the back. than cuz there was walls blocking. he just walked the length of the room looking for us and he went hmmm. while the 3 of us tried our best to stand silently while giggling like small kids. every creak sounded so loud. afraid that we would be given away. haha! i was actually in the mist of seeing xuelian's birthday present which was a jigsaw puzzle lah. imagine i was halfway taking it out of the plastic bag while adam came into the room. was like oh shit! than was holding the bag so carefully. so i had it worse. anyway he called xinying first she rejected the call. than he called me. i rejected the call. than xuelian was afraid that he would get angry so we decided to move to the tables. haha not long after that he walked pass and found us. than we were like uh we've been seating here for very long waiting for you already. ha! he didnt say anything lah. but i was like super laughing away sia. LOL. when i laugh there are the times that i cant stop lah. (edith would know the days in primary school she called me the pager cuz i would laugh silently in class, somemore very frequently) went through stuff that he ""predicted"" told us to meet again on wed urgh. when i still got lky after class which finishes at five :/&nbsp; 

oh ya. i'm happy. -glomps- got new movies to watch. =D hahaha stepup, takethelead yay! 

happy birthday xuelian! xD

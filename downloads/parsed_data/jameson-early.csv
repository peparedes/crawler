"event","Busy day today... 
I got off work at 7am.. still hating my job, and it's very existence.
Yeah yeah, ""least I gota job"" but there's others out there. I've just been too lazy to find another one.
Anyway, like I was saying, I got off work at 7am, called the Nissan dealership at 7:30.. they said they FINALLY got my new seat in.. I was thrilled, cause I've been riding around in a BRAN NEW car.. with a tear in the seat.. fuckers. Anyhow, I went up there, and it took them a LOOOOOOOOONG time.. HOURS. I was there from 7:45, till after noon.. well not really.. I got bored and went for a walk. I stopped in every store and pawn shop, and gas station in the one mile stretch between McArthur & Meridian avenue.. on both sides of Hwy66.. basically I walked over two miles.. and ended up buying some jewelry at one of the pawn shops.. I'm kind of ring crazy, and I love silver.. ""My precious"". I bought 3 rings.. they were cheap. I also found a bicycle that comes out of pawn on the 26th that I may purchace.. it's a nice new Schwinn mountain bike, with pivot suspension an disk brakes and such... I fell in love, and the guy only wants $135 bucks for it. It's a good deal, the cheapest comparable bike I've found is just shy of $500. So I'll probably get that and start mountain biking again. I've missed that. I guess I need a helmet and such also, as I plan to get serious with it this time.. like actually scaling mountainous terrain with the damn thing. OH NO! Anyway, it's after 10:00, and it's time for Jameson to go to Chilli's to see the girls.. and give them thier weekly dose of my bullshit.. so I'll holla back."

I move on.<BR>Yesterday was a day of inspiration. My dog ""Widget"" came home from the vet's office.. freshly neutered. The reason it was an inspiration, is the fact that he was playful, and full of energy.. spent the entire day playing and running around like he had just won the lottery..... I haven't had my nuts chopped off(and shall never), but if I had half of the enthusiasm he has,even after a normal day...&nbsp;I'd be doing great.<BR><BR>So this entry is different. I'm calm today..

I'll get back to you on what it is that we do here at Early Ent..&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is in the development stages, but I'll let you know the primary&nbsp;business focal points will be in the entertainment industry.. not interested in&nbsp;a&nbsp;piece of a multi-billion dollar, FUN&nbsp;and fascinating industry??? Why the hell not?? :| I want my part of that ever so tempting morsel of sweet life.... a piece of the pie.<BR></STRONG><STRONG>Speaking of entertainers... my good friend Cody Canada, and his wife&nbsp;Shannon, just bought The Wormy Dog Saloon in Stillwater, and the one in Oklahoma City.. this is exciting to&nbsp;those who are familiar with those two love birds.

They're curtrently doing well with a Universal Label.. thier stuff can be checked out at&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.crosscanadianragweed.com/"">www.CrossCanadianRagweed.com</A> . Anyway, back in Cody's college days, his little band played at the Wormy Dog&nbsp;Saloon in Stillwater, made a little bit of money..&nbsp;Shannon was a&nbsp;bartender there, and Cody &amp; Shannon met, hooked up, and fell in love right there, and have not left each other's side for&nbsp;7 years.

Tara-
   A friend indeed. My entire life has been before you.. why now, at the age of 20something, would you decide to deny me your friendship? Not to worry, things like this happen. People grow apart.. but holy hell.. our entire life was shared! We've been at each other's side through everything. I remember your Donald, and how broken you were when he committed suicide. I know you remember my Jojo.. you were there for me.. and remained there untill this year. You're such a pussy.You had to drop this on me in another time of need, at a funeral, you tell me that we can't talk anymore.The funeral of the very woman that brought us together, the person that allowed us to stay the night with each other, through those years when our parents would never allow it.What the fuck? What kind of best friend pulls that shit?I mean THAT much to you, that you would deny me any contact with you whatsoever, for a pricklick that you've known all of 8 months? How's that compare to the YEARS? Why should he mean more than your best friend? I guess I'm not good enough to be the best.. is that it? So now it's ""Mr.Fuckwad""? He finds a letter that I wrote to you when I was 15.. count those years.. that's 10! Yeah, ten years ago, I write you this letter.. in the middle of adolecense, mind you.. and he thinks it has signifigant meaning? He honestly believes that we have the same kind of love for each other NOW that we did then? Give me a fucking break. He's such an insecure dickhead, that he won't even let you visit your parents.. WAKE THE FUCK UP!You're going to be alone.. and basically a pawn in his sick game of manipulation.. look you already are his little bitch.. you do everything he says, when he says. It's so sickening to watch someone of your independance, your strength, go down like that. I can't believe you would stand for that.I'm just letting you know that I refuse to believe that YOU of all people would fall for that bullshit.. after coaching and advising me through all these years.. whatever makes you happy, whatever trips your trigger. I'm not going to witness it anymore. 
I love you always & forever,

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff9900>........ okay, so I was off work Saturday.. I didn't do much.&nbsp;I had plans with my ex girlfriend Sarah.. should have known she'd bail on me. She always did.At least she is consistent.. and I remember why she's an ex.I called another ex girlfriend, whom I've been good friends with for 5 years, Amanda.. and she was actually too busy to visit. I talked to Trish long enough to get pissed off at her. She told me that the next time that she and Tish came out to see me, she'd just drop Tish&nbsp;off, so we could ""Do our Thing uninterupted"". UGH. Women.. I know what this is, is the beginning of manipulation. Not since '99 when I told Daleda to ""Get the Fuck out of my car, and walk home"" have I allowed a female to manipulate me. I cut them off, and send them on thier way, before the bullshit starts. She was kind of a bad deal anyway.. being the first girl I dated since Natalie's death..... I wasn't ready for all that, still felt obligated to Natalie's love.Not&nbsp;recieving closure is one thing.. but losing the life of the love of your life, suddenly like that.. is a whole new form of an inexplicit ending.&nbsp;I'm glad however, that I at least tried to move on.. it helped the healing process&nbsp;in the long run. I&nbsp;actually think that wound has finally healed up pretty well, but there's still &nbsp;an ugly and very tender&nbsp;scar left behind.The type that can still hurt when pressed upon. <BR>So.. on with my DAY OFF. I slept for an hour or so,&nbsp;grabbed my wallet and hopped out the door. It was HOT, so I went to the&nbsp;friendly nieghborhood 7-11, gassed up the Nissan, and bought&nbsp;a bygod big gulp &amp; some cigs. What a rip off.. anyway...<BR>I had no idea where I was going, but I couldn't tolerate sitting around the house with all that sunshine out there. I never see the sun because of my stupid job.. so it's always a pleasure. I ended up driving north to Piedmont,&nbsp;west to Ocarche, then north north and north.. through Kingfisher, Dover, and some bullshit place called Bison, and an even more bullshit place called&nbsp;""Waukomis"".. ended up in Enid... went through that town for about 5 miles and busted a U and went back south. Basically, I wasted a quarter tank of gas doing NOTHING.Sure beats the old Chevelle, that thing would've toasted two tanks on that little jaunt without reason.<BR>&nbsp;Damn the small town&nbsp;police!These guys have nothing better to do than fuck with&nbsp;YOU. They pick out a clean car, and decide that it must be a drug trafficer... so they follow you through town&nbsp;at about 3"" off your ass, and try to make you nervous. A good brake check usually lets them have reason to&nbsp;go ahead and pull you over.. no matter how funny you think it is to watch them squirm, they don't think it is.They gonna give ya a ticket because they were following too closely? Nah.. never has happened. So anyway, I got pulled over 2 times within 60 miles, and the fun part of this was going BACK through the same towns later in the same day. I can be such a wiseass to the piggies sometimes. But... you know.... Fuck'm.<BR>So, I got back home before sunset, and I was kind of tired.. I&nbsp;walked in, looked at the caller ID.. bill collectors, and Trish had called.. I decided that I'd try calling the collectors back.lol.<BR>They hate me, but riteously so, I owe them money... the information I recieved from them though was very useful indeed. I need all of the information from them like Address, Phone number, account number, and balance due.. so I can give that shit to my lawyer. I'm so fucked financially.. but one little bankruptcy will fix all that shit. At least I get to keep the Nissan, if I want it..&nbsp;still thinking about that. <BR>So, Sunday, yeah nothing eventfull there either. I woke up at 2pm, dragged ass around the house.. went to Natalie's grave for my religious thing, cleaned it off, put a new penny down, and left my necklace behind. Think next time she needs some new flowers. Someone else has been there.. wish I knew who, they left Mardi Gras beads...probably Nina, if I had to guess. They were best friends, and Nina only comes back about twice a year, but she drops something off at the grave, and each memorial site every time she's here. I've tried numerous times to contact Nina, but never get ahold of her, she's always moving.<BR>So, after I got back from visiting with NatlieJo,&nbsp;I came home, saw that OF COURSE Trish had called, so I called her back this time. We talked for a few minutes, and then she asked if she could call me back.. I agreed.. and actually waited this time.. but I fell asleep till like 9:00, and then got up &amp; ready for work...<BR>Here I am, it's almost 4am.. I have NOTHING to do.. there's not a damn thing on tv, unless you dig infomercials and the same old music videos.... I don't... so I'm going outside for 5 minutes, to amorall my tires, and smoke a cigarette, then I'm off to cook breakfast. ""Fuck'n Hate my Job"" I say these words religiously daily, untill I leave this place.<BR>Damn I type too much..peace.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

She called alot.. to the point of annoyance. My strong point isn't telling people off, so I just left after getting ready for work. I went to Chili's and talked with Haley.. she's about the dumbest little shit I've ever ecountered, but funny and silly.. and she always puts me in a good mood. I waited patiently for Heather to notice my presence, and was glad to see her and chat for a few minutes. She told me that Chelsea(crush) had called in tonight, because she had tonsilitis. Dumbass should have those meatbags removed. She's always getting sick. I was disappointed that I didn't get to see her nonetheless. I don't even know why I find her appealing, she's the exact opposite of my ""Type"".. but whatever.*Jameson waits patiently to be noticed* So I came to work after all that madness, and of course, Trish&nbsp;finally caught me&nbsp;on the phone. She asked if she could come up here.. I was like.. Umm yeah, sure.. so&nbsp;she and her best friend Tish.. whom happens to be more attractive than Trish came to see me. I've started to wonder why it is, that Tish comes EVERY time Trish does. Is it a test? Or something along those lines? Who knows. Anyway, I'm dying here, so so tired.. so I'm outa here for a day or whenever I feel like blogging again.... <BR>Took a personality test tonight, it says I'm a ""Rockstar"" that's nice.. I can totally see that.OKay, Peezeowt!&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Chris LeDoux once stated, that a city can turn your heart to clay.. and I've felt that more than one time. I've become cold hearted... and I could care less.. so I guess in a roundabout way... my heart has become clay? I don't know. I know that I can love, and I can feel.. but lately.. nothing that anyone says or&nbsp;&nbsp;does seems to affect me in any way good or bad. This troubles me in the sense that I used to trully care about other people.. I considered all people to be worth listening to, worth consoling, worth reasoning with.. and everyone was worth befriending, and noone was a stranger. I find myself shying away from even good people lately. Trish is an outstanding young woman.. but I find myself uninterested in her.. and inadvertently so. Yesterday I could have gone and spent time with her, but instead, I spent time wiring my stereo system. I could have spent time with her today, but instead, I detailed my car, and went driving around... not looking for anything or anyone in particular. I just wanted to listen to some music, and swim in my own thoughts. <BR>Since my shoulder injury,(torn ligaments)&nbsp;I haven't been able to drive.. or swim... or much else. I couldn't even type or push a pencil without hurting. Now that I've got 50% mobility restored, I feel like a king, and the pain doesn't even bother me anymore.I don't mind that I have to lean up in my seat to reach my stereo controls, at least I can drive again... I don't care that I can't swim.. I can at least board the boat, and wade in the water.I see myself as handicapped, yet fortunate. I don't see how some people live their entire lives without an appendage. It's horrible.<BR>So, now that I'm on with my Physical Therapy... and getting better.. I find myself WANTING to do more things.. I've pushed myself to very painful limits a few times. <BR>I'm going to talk to my lawyer in the morning about filing bankruptcy, something I intended to do a while back, but haven't gotten around to. I've been too busy listening to people's bullshit, and going the extra mile to help everyone else out.. that and my driving around in circles, getting nowhere.. I'm done with all that. Noone is going to hand me a good life on a platter. I have to build it myself. It has been said that if ya want something done right, just do it yourself... I want my life to be right.&nbsp; I want to have my carreer, I want to have my cars, I want my house.. and I am seriously contemplating living in Hawaii..it's beautiful there.. and I don't think I would feel confined, even though I'd be on an Island. I will have to think about the fact that those islands, put together, aren't as big as Oklahoma.. and I go all over this state all the time. I'm a free spirited individual, so I may need to live on a larger piece of land than Hawaii has to offer.. but I'll give it a go. California is my other option.. Malibu,Santa Monica, SanFransisco,L.A... or maybe Oregon,Washington.. anywhere that's a large city, but&nbsp;less than a day's drive&nbsp;away from a beach, and some mountains,and some solitude silence. I ask alot.. but I'm more person than most.. so I need what I need, and I will stop at nothing to achieve my goals. ..<BR>Allright, so after 3 years of this BULLSHIT , the hotel business is officially the lamest EVER. I have to put up with crap that the general public, would never even be able to concieve... and they are the ones producing the bullshit. Ugh.. people. </FONT></STRONG></P>"

When he took Natalie Jo, I wondered if that were really fair... I loved her so much more than even I knew. I still love her. Man, I sometimes can't believe it's been 6 years since that awful AWFUL night.For those just tuning in. The girl of my dreams, Natalie, was finally within my grasp my senior year. We'd known each other a couple of years, and had&nbsp;been seeing each other for 8 months when Spring Break came around. Our parents still had no clue that we were seeing each other, the majority of our friends didn't know either. It would have been considered as ""unacceptable"" according to our peers,&nbsp;because of our variance in social stature. Our parents would have dealt with things just fine. Her parents are very wonderful people.... back to the point. So our senior spring break came around.. this was way back in the late 1900's. 98 to be exact.. and a group of her girlie friends went to South Padre for the week. I got to stay in OKC and work.. and race. That was my money maker then, I'd race my Chevelle on the weekends for pink slips then sell the moron's cars back to them. Yeah, I lost a few, but it was rare, and I never went home without my car... anyway, on the first Saturday of Spring Break, I got a phone call from a friend, that said I needed to go to my friend Kimber's house for a minute. They had some news, but I had to go there to find out. When I got over there, everyone I knew&nbsp;was there... but it was silent.... every head hung low, and every cheek had a tear rolling as I walked in. Natalie had been walking along Gulf Coast Blvd, and was hit by a drunk driver in excess of 100mph.She was tossed over 160' from the POI... and they claim she was killed instantly.&nbsp;Needless to say ,I was selfishly devastated. The days, weeks and months to follow, were a living hell for me. Nightmares every night, a bottle of booze every day.I turned to drugs.. I got angry with God.. questioned his riteousness, </FONT></STRONG><STRONG><FONT size=5>his&nbsp;intelligence, and his very existence.&nbsp;I quit school, I quit my jobs, I quit racing.. and began living in a blur that I don't fully remember to this day. I got arrested at 20, for undisclosed reasons on top of having liquor on my breath.... The pain, and hollowness still haunt me. It's been 6 years people. 6 years. It didn't take me that long to get over my cousin's suicide, my grandfather's death, when my best friend&nbsp;was killed in a car accident in Texas... no.. nothing can match the pain of losing the one that you fully believe is your soul mate. When she died, I died. .and I'm barely back to this very day. Love the people you have, while you have them.. .make sure they know they're loved... the next time they kiss you goodbye.. may be for good. You never know. She's waiting for me up there. I do believe that. I see her sometimes.. in my head, in my dreams... in the smile of every&nbsp;lady that is hopelessly in love.. in the sparkling eyes of every high school age&nbsp;girl I happen across.. I can still see her. I can feel her spirit so much that it's sometimes overwhelming. I have yet to finish grieving, but it helps me to know that she's still here.. it makes me stronger to know that she's still with me, every step of the way... and she helps me... I don't think I could have ever been this strong, had I never met, loved, and lost her... this is why I know it is part of God's plan...NOW I believe in God, now I trust in his good judgement, now I follow the path that he has chosen for me.. and sometimes it's the one of MOST resistance...&nbsp;this is why I trust in him to guide me through it all.. and when he can't keep an eye on me.. there's always Natalie Jo.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT size=6>Well, it's officially the first weekend of Summer. What am I doing?? Hell if I know! Last week, I met this wonderful girl named Trish.. she's very sweet, and just adorable in every way. We've hung out twice scince we first started talking. The poor thing's been feeling sick lately.. so she doesn't really want to&nbsp;socialize much, I'm sure. Her daughter has been sick as well...so she's got her hands full for now. So, yeah.. the longest day of the year went by and I didn't even notice.. in the wee hours of the second day of Summer, I got to kiss Trish...in the rain.. we got drenched, but it didn't seem to matter. The moment is what mattered.. the real storm was going on between us at that very second. I've been in a rather pleasant mood ever scince then, and I have her to thank for that. I'm actually happier than I've been in years, so this cold definatley be a good thing here...........<BR>I apologize for the shortness of this entry, I know there is more to come, but I haven't slept scince yesterday afternoon, and I'm just worn slick........ catch ya sooner or later!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

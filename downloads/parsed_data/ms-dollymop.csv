It takes strength to acknowledge our anger, and sometimes more strength yet to curb the aggressive urges anger may bring and to channel them into nonviolent outlets. It takes strength to face our sadness and to grieve and to let our grief and our anger flow in tears when they need to. It takes strength to talk about our feelings and to reach our for help and comfort when we need it.""<br /><br />""There's no ""should"" or ""should not"" when it comes to having feelings. They're part of who we are and their origins are beyond our control. When we can believe that, we may find it easier to make constructive choices about what to do with those feelings.""<br /><br />and my two favorite:<br /><br />""Love isn't a state of perfect caring.  It is an active noun like <i>struggle</i>.  To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way he or she is, right here and now.""<br /><br />""Love is like infinity: You can't have more or less infinity, and you can't compare two things to see if they're ""equally infinite."" Infinity just is, and that's they way I think love is too."""

<lj-cut text=""Click here for much Sprint idocy..."">Two weeks ago I get a text saying that I am almost at my spending limit and to call customer service. I call and inquire as this is a new account and I had paid the bill two days previously. The very nice customer serverice person says ""You currently owe $xxx.xx of which $294.85 is for texts sent on line (xxx) xxx-xxxx.""

I say ""No, we have unlimited family text plan."" to which we banter back and forth for about 15 minutes trying to find out what is wrong. It turns out that the sales person is not very bright and forgot to attach the family plan to my and K's phones and also did not put in for our '12 months of anytime minutes at 6pm for free'. Mind you, Tom wouldn't send a text message unless possibly if he was dying and couldn't speak. K and I had 3500 texts between the two of us last month. 

We have quite the laugh about how stupid the sales guy is and how hard they make life for Cust Svc. So, problem solved, yes?

I say ""Okay so you have updated the account and you will be removing the $294.85 from the bill, correct?""

NO. 

She puts me on hold and comes back and says ""Unfortunately since the texts were made when the plan was not attached they are your responsibility. My supervisor has agreed to waive half of the charges.""

*blinkblinkblink*

THIRTY MINUTES of me being adamant that as she has repeatedly admitted that this was through no fault of my own and that I most certainly am NOT responsible for those charges. She finally says that they will forward to review and if they decide to remove I will know within 7 days. 

(Yeah, right.)

I try one more time and point out that the account is correctly showing the family text plan on our account online. This apparently changes everything. Since the online is correct and the in house is incorrect her boss will run a credit through and it will hit my account in 24 hours or less.
</lj-cut>
W.T.F.?! 

Regardless, I get my bill this month, it is credited and she has also fixed my '12 months free' issues. (Which she said was impossible and that the sales person had LIED about it being available.)

All is well in Sprintland, yes?

<lj-cut text=""Oh no, they are STILL idiots..."">Today I decide to check the status of our rebate online. I clicky on the little ""we received your rebate forms track here"" link from sprint email. It says something about our rebates being on hold because we have to sign a two year agreement. Just as soon as I update our agreement they will send me my money in 4 weeks.

I go check our account online. Sure enough, our agreement end date is 07/27/2009. Now, math may not be my strong suit, but I'm pretty sure that 2009 - 2007 = two years. So, I call the dreaded cust svc line from hell. I am on the phone for 15 minutes for them to tell me to go into the Sprint office and have them explain to me what I need to do to get my rebate.</lj-cut>

Bastards.

"event","Well the break was alright. Eventful and busy most of the time but alright.Hmm lets see. Thanksginving dinner was gay. My stepmom just likes to have her lesbian aunts at our house so I was like whoa im not eating with them because there old and creepy. So me and my brother just sat in my room and i ate mashed potatoes and thats it. Everyone was talking about how they got so stuffed and I was just like well I just ate some mashed potatoes. Uhm then that weekend I went to my moms and i got to see my grandma and my cousin who is like 6 months  and hes really really cute. Then I came home and Sarah came over and we just hung out with my sister like me and all my friends do when they come over. Uhm then we hung out all day Sunday too. Just sorta laid around and stuff. Then she stayed the night at my house on sunday and we went to 7-11 and bought really big hot dogs and beef jerkey.( I think thats how you spell it) And then we had to wake up on monday and that was hard. i dont think that i was up until about 7:00 so I had to take the quickest shower Ive ever tooken before in my life. and then we rushed to school and the day was boring and uneventful.I came home and my computer just decided to not work so I slept. Today I got up and went to school..yadda yadda. Nothing happened today either excpet I did have a subsitute in math which was pretty cool. And I came home..my computer was fixed so i got online for awhile and then i went to sleep again. i slept from just about 4 or 5 until 8. And now Im sitting here. being really cold. My house and the people in it are really starting to bug me again. I dont do anything and I have an ""attitude"" and Im sick of having to be respectful to a 19 year old who is more immature than any person that Ive ever known.She can be rude to me and when im rude back she runs upstairs and tells my dad and her mom. Its annyoing.Its like dealing with a 5 year old with her. Gosh..Alright Ill stop complaing. Anyways..   Im pretty exited about Stephanies party. It should be fun..well im hoping nothing bad happens. Ill update tomorro. -comment if you wish--<3333

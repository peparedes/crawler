"event","How can you not love kids? If you like people you must love kids. I look at my kids at the daycare and I can see the people they will become and sure some of them are annoying but they are fascinating. Some are inhibited already and self absorbed, and too self aware for some reason. Some are pure and wild and interested and give you their opinion on everything. Some are fragile and growing and easily affected. Some of them are so interested in the other kids. Some of them are blunt and bullying. Some are loud and sharing all their thoughts, some you hardly know they are there. And you are put in charge of this dynamic and told to organize and teach them. You better bring all your energy, all your ideas and enthusiasm or they will lose attention and you will be trying to control Lord of the Flies. 
But the most important aspect of all of this, the way to keep these kids in order, is to show them that you will love them, that you understand them and are fair, that you will try to understand them even when you don't at first, but that when they break social rules you will catch them and teach them not to. Man, we should all have to have PhD's before we even set foot in these daycare centers."

"event","sick at home today, the flu is going around at work. I had a fever this morning that has mostly gone away but I can't believe how achy and terrible i feel. I wish I had gone in just to be doing something besides sitting here feeling terrible with nothing good on TV. okay, actually not, because then i'd give it to all the kids and they'd come in sick too, and also i just couldnt deal with them today feeling like this. But I still think about them all day, the little rugrats. How fucked up is that?
So in the course of trying to feel better, I have taken every type of pill, every vitamin, smoked every type of substance and am drinking every type of thing in the house. Something has to start helping soon or at least let me sleep.
But don't get the wrong impression here....my new years resolution is to quit all that, and so far I've been good and I forsee more good once this flu is gone. I feel tremendously better. No more withdrawing or craving this or that. There's two six packs in the fridge that have sat there untouched since new years, and two cigarettes in my bag and today I'm going to throw them away. Don't get me wrong, I still plan to get a bottle of wine for the friends coming over next week, but the daily drinking is going to be finished.
My other resolution is more nebulous....I will replace my negative self talk with affirmations and pro active thinking. It's your barely-there conciousness, muttering to yourself and writing your memories, that tells your body what state you're in and what chemicals to release, and I used to be in good control of that and I'm going to get back there. Of couse the control was because of dealing with alot of crap, which is no longer around, so that's good. Time to be at peace inside and out."

"event","just another day....
been planning to write all day and now, it just doest seem impt. had a fight ? with my best friend.... she sat there on the couch staring at the TV when i talked saying ""mmm hm,mmm"" and i dont know what i said so i got mad and stopped talking to her too and tension was everywhere. yikes. maybe she was into the TV show? But she seemed really mad and she reads into everything so i have no idea. so the next day yesterday, i had to take a benadryl and whiskey and caffene and nicotene and half a beer and several sudafed, just to get to work and smile at people. ARG then i started to get a migraine and took several alleve and fought it off with more sudafed and coffee and made it thru the day and came home and hugged the boyfriend and felt better till i got mad worrying about that psycho chick and went to bed then got up when he came to bed to read until i fell asleep. then got up this morning and didnt take anything except a cup of coffee and made it thru work nd now its friday night so its me and the whiskey andf the man is off buying othewr things best not mentioned and at least i will sleep well tonight and get up and keep going. But i did situps at lunch break and soon the exercise will be a habit anf i wont need all these substances. hopefully. it doesnt matter. it doesnt really matter. it just doesnt. all that matters is being happy in the moment and being good to others too. when you die, thats just the end. THE END!!!!! no heaven no reincarnation, sorry times up hope you had fun while the neurons were firing asnd helped others neurons to fire too. and thats it, heaven is this present moment. and the worst abuse, the worst, well it ends. hopefully. mine did. eventually it does. and thats the end of the hell and the neurons start firing agin. and you're left with the biology, the pre-programmed attention seeking and environment predicting and pattern craving. and if you're lucky you find someone to believe in to make it all worth it."

"event","another bad, bad dream two days ago and it has shook me up good. here I was going along fine dealing with every little thing and then Wham. And it just kind of shuts me down. I got good and drunk this weekend and read a great novel about womens coming out stories and it helped alot to see how people have dealt with the traumas in their lives. People being locked up and drugged and escaping and I complain about one f;ashback. Then I went nuts cleaning which always makes you feel good somehow, if you dont start thinking about the purposelessness of it and how things just get messy again! :)
I've been meditating on feeling REAL. went to a workshop for work on sensory integration disorder. made me feel lucky to be able to process everything effectively, made me pay attention to the things I don't like, body language and how I avoid conversation and contact with people. I just want to feel IN my body and not as if i'm having things relayed by a third person processor. Isn't that how most people normally feel? I just want to be genuine and act on my own self and feelings and thoughts, not on the ""best possible reaction: response that my brain is always calculating and suppressing my real self with, the smile and bear it response while i'm all mad and confused underneath. people see through it and see that i'm on autopiolet and acting fake. i'm just a serious space cadet. maybe i can un-learn that tho."

"event","it is the part of you that is aware of other's body language and their needs, and acts contrary to helping them out. it is the part of you that is selfish and mean because you think it is the only way to protect yourself and save your energy. it is the part of yourself that sometimes feels OK and connects with others on a level beyond language and calms them and makes them smile. it is the dark shadow self that barely exists but twinkles with christmas-light chakra energy clearest of all the inner selves. it is the part of you that perks up and listens when a two year old child points at purple and tells you it is your color, it is you, when you never wear that color or said you like it. it is the part of you that saw auras around people when you were two. it is the part of you that hates the robotic, false, autopilot self that smiles fake smiles and tries to be friendly but doesnt know how because its sole purpose is to put up a false front for others in order for them to like you and be nice to you despite the fact that the falseness and fakeness is glaringly obvious. it is the part of you that you hid when you were a child because it is sensitive and curious and needs unconditional comfort and reinforcement that just wasnt available because when you cried and couldnt say why they only got frustrated and wouldnt help you because they had to be selfish and protect themselves and save their energy. it is the tone in your voice rather than the words, the quick reaction before the calculated one, the hesitation that betrays the separation of selves."

"event","just me and the bottle, relaxin'. the boy is sleepin'.
i seriously need to find a way to deal with this anxiety, a non-drug way. a change in thinking pattern, world view, somethin.. made my friend uncomforitable today. and I know she is anxious too and i shouldn't be blaming myself entirely, so i'm not. but there's got to be a better way. shlould start running again maybe. blow off steam and get those endorphins moving. also i need to be more with the establishing connections. not have to be so frikkin strong all the time. just relax and let them reassure me, and reassure them. i have such a bad history, i have a lot of ground to make up and a lot of broken trust to repair. a whole lot of work to do before i'm halfway deserving. well, it will be worth it. cuz my first instinct, changing the chemistry, always seems to lead to a loss of awareness too that just defeats the purpose. 
I wish someone had reached out to me those times i freaked out. I know, giving attention to ""negative"" behavior only reinforces it. I was acting out in a non constructive way....or not acting out, really, shutting down more like it. shutting out. shutting up. being immature, they said. 
part of me feels i need to ""run away and deal with my issues"". I keep supressing that because i don't want to destroy a good thing. I want to keep it and make it better and get better and be safe and content and happy and secure. I want to play by the traditional rules because I see my rules leading to being cold and drunk and in bad situations. This good, is real, it's around me all the time. I keep thinking that if I work hard enough I can repair all the damage done by the poison I let leak all over the place. If I go, they will just tell each other ""i told you so"" ""I knew it"". no one will come after. so the real question is, would he be better off? The real question is, is he happy? could I make happiness?
I've made a couple good steps. a couple good steps were made for me, and I need to remember to thank that friend. I need to remember to be real, always honest, to open up. it's better to find out sooner rather than later. people won't love you if you don't let them and for whatever reason i haven't been letting them."

"event","i have a hard time seeing myself as others see me. I have been trying to exercise the habit of thinking about what others are thinking, more, but i always find myself awkward, assuming others know what I mean when i haven;t explained myself properly. it's something often seen in autistic people, for who knows what reason. I've always had the philosophy that I should just worry about myself, not judging others, but i think that's a good philosophy for an adult, not a forming personality of a small child, who needs to develop theory of mind for others, and judge their motives and intentions. Instead I end up with a worst-case-scenario template of other's motives used for everyone, so that I fear and am scared of everyone, except a few I cling to and ""trust"", meaning i sacrifice anything in myself to keep them happy and keep myself safe. What we have here is the beginnings of paranoia. Which I have been medicated for.
Now, what I came here to do...I have tried meditation, but I just end up worrying. I can't do the ""blank mind"" thing too well. So how about stream-of-conciousness? well ok but why on live journal? who knows, maybe i will get lucky and meet someone who understands. or i will understand someone who needs it."

so i think this article has been on the guardian homepage for a couple of hours or so. there are approximately 90 comments posted at the moment. there are some utterly charming contributions to the debate happening. traderwinds seems to be my favourite so far. i am not able to do much more than just sit here shaking my head in what may be wonderment or distress, scorn or fright, incredulity, pity or resignation. aargh; cockfaces!

i met a bloke once who had studied 'Feminism'. He was straight. Now, whatever that bloke said (and he was an earnest bell-end), and the same goes for the watery berk in the picture above, all they're doing is trying to get laid/have an easy life. Yes ladies, it's true, ALL blokes, including your right-on git who says all the right things, thinks first and last with his (probably tiny) phallocratic weapon.

You'll make your man give himself a brain tumour with all that repression. Let him be himself. Show him he'll still get laid if you do more than 50% of the washing up.

It never occurs to feminists or constructivists that gender roles are played for a reason.

I once lived with a girl who demanded that I did half the housework, despite the fact that I worked full-time while she did not. She claimed to a feminist but her motivation was very much about gaining the upper hand, and had nothing to do with ensuring equality.

But I'm not the type of man who would huff and puff and blame it all on feminism - I think it's perfectly normal for a human being to seek the advantage. The desire for equality is not innate - it comes entirely from the willingness to compromise.

the poor lad is severely pussy-whipped, and will regret it in years to come. and that, for all her feminist posturing now, i have no doubt that come divorce time she will want her piece.

Poor Andrew. He must be the laughing stock of his friends, if he's even told them he's a ""feminist""!

life is the way it is because of what we have to do to survive and prosper. it's not a conspiracy but people do exploit the way we choose to live our lives.

i think it's sad that a lot of feminists basically feel the way they do because they can't trust or be relaxed with men

che77 [a commenter with views seemimgly of the not-entirely-hateful variety] - have some self-respect, sir. there are no watery girls around to see how much a watery berk you are. as usual, you'll have to pull you pud over a semi circle of non-expolitative pictures of women spread over your hessian rug.

Yes, Andrew can say it... he just doesn't mean it. He just wants to get his leg over I'm afraid.

That is no disrespect to him. It is just the way we are. All of us. We are guided by our John Thomas!!!"

<b>I Am A:</b> True Neutral Human Sorcerer (3rd Level)
<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>12<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>10<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>12<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>14<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>11<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>12
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>True Neutral</b> A true neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. He doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most true neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil after all, he would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, he's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way. Some true neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run. True neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion. However, true neutral can be a dangerous alignment because it represents apathy, indifference, and a lack of conviction.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Sorcerers</b> are arcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons. Charisma is very important for sorcerers; the higher their value in this ability, the higher the spell level they can cast.

At the same time we do think that many men have learned to express their anger or insecurity through violence. Many men have come to believe that violence against a woman, child or another man is an acceptable way to control another person. 

The problem does not stop with physical violence. There are forms of emotional violence--from sexist joking, to sexual harassment at work, to other domineering forms of behaviour. By remaining silent about these things, we allow other men to poison our working and learning environments. 

We're not male bashers because we're men, working with men, who care about what happens in the lives of men.

"event","so really, do i write like a male or a female? maybe i am merely trying to dupe unsuspecting readers into assuuuuuming a feminine narrator with my username thingy. maybe i am an entirely fictional construct and no real person ever was here. maybe i am just a pathetic me. who can tell. 

i never saw this before today: http://bookblog.net/gender/genie.php

but apparently my ramblings of 4/5/07 were in fact written by a male, whereas those of 25/5 were written by a female. its a close run thing, though. 

here (http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1079265,00.html) is a small old article explaning a little more about how it works. or doesnt. 

now, essentially it surely is just saying that an academic style piece of writing would be thrown up as being masculine, whereas, maybe a chatty email full of family news or whatever would come out as having been written by a woman? nice.


so in the news this week there has been a bunch of stuff kicked up about male vs female language use and communication skills, kicked off by a new book release by one deborah cameron. the guardian has posted extracts from ""The Myth Of Mars and Venus"" here: 

http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/relationships/story/0,,2180812,00.html
http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,,2181805,00.html      http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,2182396,00.html

the times has a review here: http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2602555.ece


anyway how about two more books c/o the guardian, cropping up in my perusing:

""I was forced, in a sense, to put myself in this book, because researching it made me realise that it's not out there, it's here. It's happened to my friends, it happens to one in five women, and the conviction rate is shocking.""

this is an interesting but unrelated review from the guardian of another book http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2184048,00.html



""The Stuff of Thought is a book about semantic - linguistic - meaning... The idea that language shapes or constrains thought is one of the intellectual commonplaces of the last 100 years... Pinker, however, is on a mission to debunk it. ""Words are not the same as thoughts,"" he says, ""and much of human wisdom consists of not mistaking one for the other.""

In Pinker's philosophy, the stuff of thought is thought: we can only argue about the meanings of words or the aptness of metaphors because we have something to think with apart from words and metaphors.""

another decently interesting book review, about how we use language; but 'we' encompassing male and female usage rather than the other http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2184451,00.htm



well and, gendered language and language use is something decently interesting to me. also heres something, if i am working with a speaker of english as a second language in a conversational way, am i influencing their ""english personality"" in any 'female' way, such that, for example, if they were using online forums or whatever, a third party might assume them to be female? if i were to have the same practice with a male speaker of any language that i was studying, would the same be true in reverse? now i guess that i would be corrected were i to sound overwhelmingly male, and probably any male having picked up speech mannerisms or whatever from me might also have his language adjusted if he were talking with another male native english speaker? or female, i suppose we all have ideas of appropriacy and normalcy as far as it goes, and would correct to them. thinking about that with regards to the idea of having different personalities in second or third languages, or at least differing personal traits; or perhaps simply differenct reactions, being differently perceived - its surely inevitable that (excluding bilinguals, trilinguals etc and by that i mean people who have grown up from birth with more than one language being input and, at least, in the situations ive experiences have equal amounts of sensitivity towards different cultures with those languages as native tongues) transplanting even a person with near native competency into another society where one of their languages is a first language, the context would lead to differing perception. in fact, as i write this, im being slapped in the face with the usa (well something like portugal/brazil was my first thought, but hey): even putting someone into a different context sharing the same native language causes unsurety. and if my primary points of contact with us english (other than the pretty much unavoidable tv, film, book all pervasiveness) is male, would that lead to my colloquial usage of us slang being more 'male'. then, if there is that influence how can we say that language use is gendered? but so it is, apparently, and so, somewhere along the line, there is a hole in my theory, haha. well, maybe it is simply something that we can constrain to our native languages being used in our native context, and the intuition that we use them with. potentially then it would be inevitable in a second language, or even in a second dialect of our native language? 

so anyway, maybe its a nonsense idea. between writing and posting i have set out the proposal (not incidentally, probably an original one, but something i at least have not come across before now) to a small and nonrepresentative sample. who thinks its trash, haha. so to end on more concrete news, this week i bought albums by clem snide, bob dylan and bruce springsteen. im enjoying them one and all so far."

"event","well i found this blog linked to from craftzine (haha ok now everybody knows what an exciting person *i* am, huh) http://thelongestyear.typepad.com/my_weblog/ but well i read back a little and now i feel very strange. well ive been feeling a bit displaced and unconnected but well, its just crazy. i dont know, i suppose explaining my reactions is redundant since everyone has their own. but its made me feel sort of sick and churned up and more angry angry at the governments who decide to create this sort of thing when it affects people, real people, and yet barely touches them. like tony blair, when he resigns shortly, what will be the repurcussions for him of the decisions that he has taken? well. my mother says that i am too angry and militant and paranoid about the state of the place. im not sure whether she is joking or not. i am not sure what i think about that. ooh, there are local elections today. were, rather. yesterday. 

in any event, and a giant leap of subject, before i go off to scour ebay for silk flowers, semi precious gemstones, pliers and interesting fabric (dont knock it ;) ) i am putting out an appeal for laptop recommendations which dont exceed the grand-ish mark (prefereably under, obviously, hehe, though that is without VAT since hopefully ill be able to get hold of it that way) since mine is up for replacement. requirements: spec to match the necessary for oblivion which i received at christmas and have just about got working with the downloading of ridiculous quantities of drivers and patches but which makes my fan sound as if its about to lift my wee machine off the table. and thats about it. prefereably decently quiet, and that doesnt get too hot (my only reservations about buying from rock again, since their warranty service has been fab and the machines not in bad shape still, given what ive dont to it and that its nearly 4). ive been doing some research but well, im lazy, haha. 

and well i met with marc for our conversation exchange today but i am so inexcusably lazy i think about 10 minutes was in spanish and something like 3 hours of english, lol, the poor man. well and we went to visit his girlfriend at work, which was the first time i had met her and my poor social and spanish skills manifested themselves equally. the shame. but she seems lovely and he is very nice and didnt make me feel dreadful, bless his heart :) i like talking to him a lot, he is very sensible. and it cheered me up a decent amount. and he makes lots of funny faces when hes trying to remember words, which i try not to laugh at. but dont always succeed haha. its very strange though, finding out about people that you just meet. until now i suppose i have been more used to knowing people just because - in school, in university, in various different societies - circumstances dictate who you meet and that you spend time in the same place and you basically learn stuff about each other before you figure out whether you actually get on or not. well i think that marc and i have a useful (ish, haha) and decently entertaining time talking, but its funny that almost every week i am surprised by something. its very strange not knowing about peoples pasts. its always fun finding new ways of doing things though.  

and im booking my flight home tomorrow, yay. i am so tired. i should have around 10 days home before my next job starts so im looking forward to a hair cut, some severe lazing, some beer consumption, and some gossip :D  

and i think i am addicted to chocolate cereal. i havent taken my paper/card recycling down for a while (tomorrow, i promise) and im actually shocked at myself with how many cereal boxes there are. i think im getting through about a kilo a week. aargh. 

well im feeling very unfocused and i suspect it shows so i am off."

(now, i really hope we are indeed the light blue people). i shockingly miss some people who arent ella from university. i will attempt to remedy this with emails at some point. i have watched something like the top 50 of the hundred (so called) greatest tear jerkers of all time and some tears were indeed jerked. dead poets, for one. ahh little old wimpy me :) still i cant say i was that bothered by et. i think i was sad at the time but it was a fair many years ago now and i just dont remember enough of it for a short clip to reduce me to a blubbering heap of snivel. i have realised how super proud i am of some wonderful people. i have sort of thought about whether anyone could have not existed without it having a detrimental effect on at least one person and thus have concluded that even people i classificate as knobbers have more than likely had a positive impact somewhere on someone and so anyway its all good. i have *just* concluded that one of the tracks on my rather old silversun album must be a cover. i have pondered whose wedding will be the next i attend out of the friends i know now. i have got to know a nice person a little better and am superhappy about them being so nice. i have yet to figure out how much i am in control of anything, how much i delude myself as to this, and how much am i on the mark. i have been advised to try a starbucks chai latte on my return to somewhere that is more barcelona-like than here. i have thought you was a toad. i have o no probably got to stop now see im better not to start than to try and reign myself in onse i get going ahahaha.)"

Translation is a normal and necessary part of all human life. It involes breaking out of one's own enclosed and private language, and breaking into someone else's; it is an overruling of the self.""

your face, only. Your hair, your ear, your thigh.
         And then, out of nowhere, your tongue like a hot little fish [...]
         And was it your mouth, or the memory of your mouth?
Or was it a fish? Whatever it was, it was there.
There in the bloodstream, bruising artery, vein,

remember now
 
on the furthermost tip of my tongue, like a dream."""

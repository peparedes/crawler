"event","I was about half an hour into my mission when it got called off.  As much as I'm glad to keep the air conditioning, I'm still bored out of my mind.  <i>Out of my mind</i>.  Gaara is still doing his glaring thing.  Kankurou ... is indisposed.  I had to take some of his senbon.

I snuck off with his senbon (hello, ninja) and went down to the drug lockup to see what I could get.  There's some good stuff down there, tranquilizers, poisons, stimulants.  I took a few bottles of a few certain things and dipped the senbon in the rest, and when I can get the chance to use them, I will.

Now, to find some food before Kankurou and his tubby gut become permanently indisposed, and Gaara starts twitching."

"event","Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my <i><b>God</b></i>.

The air conditioning is back.

Edit: Shit.  Father just ordered us out.  I can't catch a break here.  Hope the grease holds out on the fan."

"event","Perhaps Father is meaning to starve all three of us to death.  It's been a day and no one has been by to check on us or give us any food.  Going without food during a mission or even during the chuunin exam was fine, but if Father ever wants me to be a satisfactory kunoichi he has to give me <i>something</i> to eat.  Then Kankurou would quit making fun of my chest.

Then again, Father would rather me not be a kunoichi at all, but a ninja, so I suppose the point is moot.

Hey Kankurou, I'll rock-paper-scissors you for food duty."

"event","Spent most of today pacing around Gaara's room at the (mostly undamaged) hospital trading glares with him.  ""Attend to your brother"", huh?  Sir, perhaps you do not realize, but Gaara needs no attending to.  At least not the kind that you're thinking of.

I fixed my fan.  I found a blowdryer in the street after lunch and brought it back to see if it worked.  It did, although Gaara shot his umpteenth glare at me for the noise.  It wasn't as if he trying to sleep.  I have to find a way to replace the bamboo in the fan with some lightweight aluminum that won't otherwise swell up in humid climates, like this one.  I don't understand how the population of Konoha can go around wearing the long sleeves and jackets that they do.  At least in the desert it makes sense to wear loose-fitting clothes with sleeves.

I'm cranky because the humidity is plastering the hair to the back of my neck, and no matter what I do I can't stop sweating.

It's all thanks to Gaara, because the parts that were actually damaged at the hospital were the compressors for the air conditioning system.

Edit: Still bored.  Kankurou, could you <i>please</i> stop making Karasu's mouth do that creepy crackly thing?  Gaara's... twitching."

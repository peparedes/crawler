"event","TOday was a momentous event in human history. Nintendo ""released"" the name of the new system, which up untill now every one thought had been called the revolution. THat was not the event, the event was that upon hearing about this ""change"" every one got excited, and then went WTF?! when they found out it as now called ""Wii"". 
If I was nintendo, I would switch it back. THe whole ""Snakes on a plane"" Idea will only work once. no ones gunna buy your expencive system if it sounds like a 1st grader's name for the occupant of their pants.
In other news, MY MP3 player came back. After 2 months of being MIA, it appeared in Oklahoma at the desired destination, and creative sent it back. Not only that, they upgraded it to a 6 gig. happy times :). Not a whole lot other then that right now. 
more excitment when it happens

"event","French exchange student arrived today, he seems pretty cool. I was pretty excited, and I think my sister almost died of nervousness. her week long cleaning attack came to an end with his arrival. He gave me a CD by a french muscian named -M-. It's pretty good, a bit different then what i'm used to, but then again, half a world a way would do that. Also for you XFers, the arenas finnaly been posted, which has been a big hting for me, I'm happy :). I can't wait until gr4ve posts his final rules on it, because then we can begin. 
on another note, I down;oaded an snes emulater, and have been playing quite a bit of smash TV and megaman. unfortunatly, i'm not too good at either, oh well. Also I need to brush up my mortal kombat skills, maily combos, because i can't seem to do any specials. I want to do the ""get over here"" thing with scorpion, but i can never seem to do it.
until our paths cross, this is

"event","contrary to popular beleif, this is actually a good combination. It was a spur of the moment dissision my friend justin and I came up with about a year ago, I think that was the weekend after leuge(lueage? luege?) finals last year. It was also followed by hours of Red Vs. Blue, perfect dark, happy gilmore, and little Daniel(our crazy midget friend. Ina failed attepmt, Justin and I went on a quest last night to get this pizza again, unfortunalty our planes where botched by vegtable stir-fry and mortal combat. MORTAL COMBAT!!!!!!!!! Not only did we watch the movie at 10, we also played #1 and #3 on Justin's computer. it was silly. Noob saibot sucks... My sister's french exchange student's going to be coming pretty soon, that should be intresting. I can't make a mean joke about it because my sister reads this so, I give you the ""ad your own punch line joke"" 
The french exchange student is coming, we should hide the *place your punch line here*

"event","hmm I've put hte link every where, but no one reads, oh well, I still don't know how many poeple read my last one, lots of people made coments about it, but never in it. maybe it'll end up the same here. any ways, spent most of the sunny today(yes its back!) drawing a house across the street, turned out mediocre. then I drew a quick sketch of one of the heavy models from E.Y.E. He turned out better, but still not tops. I guess I'll keep trying until i get something out. Right now I'm drawing one of my favorite zombies in freehand, those on xf, take a guess t who it is, shouldn't take you more then 2 tries. Spring breaks almost here, and that could mean a whole lot of fun, might even be sunny for this years shinanigans.
until you can find the hypotomoose,

"event","hello vast cybernet world, its me again. wrestling clubs gunna start up eventually, Can't wait:). In the computer world, I've been drawing in flash freehand, which is a most fun program. I'm not a great artist, but If i fool around long enough in freehand, most things turn out all right. RIght now I'm sketching charecters from E.Y.E. ya, you know the website with all the french people on it. If any of them turn out any good I'll post em. I was also looking at 3d modeling programs, but on price inspection i remebered im not made of money, and those programs aint cheap, looks like I'll be sticking with flash. BIg news of the day is.... I think its finnaly stopped raining! the sun, it's burning me! ahhHHHHHHH
until another day

"event","Now harnessing the power of internet explorer, and antiquated technology, I can update my LJ. its a happy day for all of you again. In the few days i haven't updated, I've started working in flash freehand. It is possible the most fun thing macromedia has made while staying in 1 frame. I'm suprised it can't make you breakfast. It made me wounder though, maybe I should take the step in 3d modeling. Freehand allows you to have a somewhat 3d objects, butI would like something more. If I get good enough soon enough, then I might be able to help these guys with their video games. http://fseye.free.fr/forum/index.php?sid=1435c297a32265ccb94ddf92f27a3bcc They're in France! luckily enough two of the gusy speek fairly good english. hmm mine aint too good either.

"event","guess what every body, IT RAINED AGAIN! and it looked so promising too. oh well, i guess we'll have to wait for summer to see the sky again. I feel like where ripping off seatle with our weather patterns. I would also like to point out to that the sign in for LJ is possibly the worst thing ever. after countless attempts i have deemed it impossible to sign in at the login page. when i try to it says my password is either a)wrong or b) I get sent to a page of java script. SOme how the java script just doesn't cut it when its inactive."

<img src=""http://membres.lycos.fr/zorrodateur/ressources/ed209-2.jpg"" />
Well thats an intresting way to start a day, which would describe everything so far this year. A giant robot with guns who wants to ride the horse. for those who aren't deep enough to find meaning in such statements(gosh, i mean come'on its not that hard to understand such a medaphore) It means that this years has been strange towards the bad side. first off rain? i mean theres rain and theres RAIN! weve been having RAIN! or more accuratly OMG WERE ALL GUNNA DIE AHHHHH RAIN! where its been almost nonstop raining for a couple months now. THen USPS stole my MP3 player( or lost it, either way I lose) luckily my father was kind enough to buy me one of a lesser value. just finished putting ym music on it.
And that my friends is all you get for today.
Signing off its the froggerbot, and his secret identity

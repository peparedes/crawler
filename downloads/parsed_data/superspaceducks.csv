"event","Okay so I'm getting lazier and lazier with it as time goes on. I like to do it but it, like my homework, never seems to get completed. I guess it's a brain fuck or something like it. Life has been going slow, and it kinda sucks. I feel like I am getting a little paranoid, I feel like people don't really trust me. Maybe I'm going insaine. I guess that it will pass. 
Other wise things are going great. I got second in poetry over the whole state on last saturday and that helped my team to get fifth over all. Which owns because last year we were number 21 in the state; a whole 16 points plus the other five teams that went this year that werent there last year. I was sooo pumped.
We only have two more meets this year and then my high school career is over. Oh well, I can judge novie rounds next year and help out with the coaching.
I'll write more latter. Right now I have to actually do work while I'm in school.
Besides I have to go back to make out with that hottt Sara girl. I don't care if she is seeing anyone write now, he doesn't have to know. JK.
Peace,

Ryland"

"event","Oh yes. A day off. Sooo sweet. Well it really wasn't a day off. I was working durring the day on the school play. Infact I was working most of the day (from nine to four.) But I would much rather work on a play any day than attend that pain in the ass, up tight, hypocrite, Mrs. Brown's class. In any case I am in a good mood. I've been working hard and getting due respect for it. Besides my work is clearly visable on the stage.
     Wow I am hyper right now. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I'm getting up early to go and do work on lighting and try to blind myself with the glory of electricity. Then I'm going to the diverstity team retreat. We will have fun all night, lots of girls. Oh yes. It will be enjoyable.
     I have gotten into one of those marraige at fourty things. Once I turn fourty and if I am not married or seeing anyone at that time than I am going to get married to one of my friends Shyla. Part of me is in love with her anyway and I haven't seen her in a long time and I really need to. In anycase not much else is up. Just keepin buisy and happy.

Good sight. Check out the episodes of Salad Fingers. Very fucked up and funny.

"event","This is my first entry. I can't type tonight and I know right off the bat that I am not going to use this all the time but the times that I do if anybody has any general interest in reading this...god knows why you would...I will do it when I get a chance.

So to start off my first entry:

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR I want to pull out my hair and yell fuck you at everything in my way! Why are some people sooo great in their minds that they think that they can boss us all around? Fuck them! I'm meen really...who died to make you king and queen shit? 

OK better now...The play is going up soon. Very bien. It's gonna be great and has been a blast to work on but is a huge part of my time that I don't have. So it's gonna be a relife on two levels. 

Other wise life is good. Not much to complain about but stress. But when am I not stressed out...wait maybe you don't know me so you don't know when I'm not...trust me I'm almost masochistic in the ways that I strech myself. Anyway, I have work to do because I'm a lazy piece of shit and didn't get my homework done for class and the quarter ended yesterday so shit is due asap.

Peace."

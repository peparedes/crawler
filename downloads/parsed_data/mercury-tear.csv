Well today i just cleaned my room and rearranged some posters and stuff. And my mom was getting ready for this little get-together we were having with the familys of the girls i car-pool with and so she was busy preparing this wonderful meal and getting the house all perfect. she went insane with getting the house spottless for the dinner thing.  well they came and Sydney and Cornelia and i went up to my room to hang out and we got really bored so we ended up playing hide and seek in the dark.  Then we tryed to get some of the neighbor-hood kids together to play man hunt but that didnt end up working out cause my brother wouldnt get off his fat ass to get the hot guy across the street so we just gave up and continued playing hide and seek and then they left....ya pretty boring day huh...bleeeeehhhhhh

"event","Ok well, i guess i'll start the journal-thingy with today's oh so exciting events...Ok, well today was the last day before the long weekend so everyone was so antzy to get out.  I had classes like usual, hung out with the same people.. nothing new.  Oh, and i went to the Varsity football game against PCD. We won.. of course... and yes, brendan and jes, i was there and saw you guys like i said i would.  There wasn't really anyone to hang out with so i just attempted to play soccer with some freshmen. It was sad, thats all i can say.  Oh and about the freshmen, i know i hang out with them alot, but thats only because they are really cool people, i mean, they dont bitch at everything i do like half of our class does. But the fresh. guys are a little too full of themselves, i mean, they think they are all that and that they control things...oh just you wait till winter with the snowball fights and yess...little ones, you will get hazed in the dorms...muahhaaa, actually, i dont know if they'll get hazed, people seem to like them, but they are cocky. 
How is it that last year our class was so cool and we all hung out together and now, its just fallen apart? Oh well, at least i have my two dorm buds haha, ((wink wink))  


well i guess thats enough blog for now-- 
oh, one more thing....

"event","If you haven't heard I gots me a brand new <a href=""http://hyperwrench.com/blog"">art blog</a>.  A place where I can put up drawings and such as well as the occasional rant about pointless things.  This also is a way for me to be the one getting the benefits of having people see my work (in terms of advertising and such) and not have someone else benefit from my work.  So this means no more LiveJournal, Deviant Art, and so forth.  I've already deleted a number of social networking sites/profiles.  So in 2008 look forward to a more scaled back web presence (I hoping I will never have to leave the confines of the HyperWrench Webiverse&trade).  So set your book marks to awesome and come swing by the new digs.  Just keep your feet off the sofa, I just had it cleaned."

"event","Seeing as never visit and/or post here I figure I should do a little up date of the status of current stuff I'm doing.  

1) Fireball #2 - finished, proof approved (though there was a typo I noticed entirely to late, but it's not a huge deal) and should be on it's way soon.  <a href=""http://fireball.hyperwrench.com/gallery.html"">There's preview up at the official Fireball website.  </a>Should be ready for sale mid November (hopefully).

2)Gary and Ted - Finally went ahead and registered the domain, so change all of your book marks to <a href=""http://garyandted.com"">www.garyandted.com.</a> The old url redirects, but I'm not sure about the rss feed transferring over, so resubscribing may be necessary.

3) Fireball #3 - Pencils are finished, starting on inks.  This is a different direction I'm taking in terms of inking, which I'm doing all digitally this time around.  <a href=""http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f209/HyperWrench/fb2_1ink_lowres.jpg"">I think they look pretty good.</a> Also if anyone is interested in doing a pinup or four to six page back up story (write, draw, or a combination of both) I'd be glad to hear it.  The job doesn't pay anything, but I can hook you up with a few comp copies and gratitude.

4) This is probably the biggest one, a little thing I like to call <a href=""http://garyandted.com/images/cover_final_lowrgb.jpg"">Gary and Ted: Society Tastes Funny. </a>Thats right, the first year of Gary and Ted collected in one book.  Now you can take them everywhere you go in this easy to carry 100 page book.  No longer do you require a laptop and wireless connection to be able to read G&amp;T on the toilet.  I should be getting the final copies mid November as well.

This also gives me a better opportunity to promote the strip due to the ease of being able to hand someone a book as opposed to saying, check out the website.  On a related note if anyone knows of any places that would be willing to host a signing of said book as well as Fireball comics let me know, I've got a few ideas but am always open to hear other ideas.

And that's where my projects are at right now, I'd be farther ahead if I didn't have to work full time.  Damn my need for employment."

"event","I'm starting to get really tired of the way that I get like no recognition from local print media.  I've sent then local paper ""Gary and Ted"" in hopes that they will run it and give me some exposure.  I did it a few months ago and got no response what so ever.  Nothing.  Not even a simple ""Thanks but no thanks"".  I tried again a week ago and have yet to hear anything.  I just don't get it.  It's not like I'm looking for money, I do it for free already I just wish they would at least consider including local talent in their publication.  It's not like I'm a musician who can go and play at an open mic night to get people exposed to my work.  I've tried putting up posters but that really doesn't work out to well.  I've put flyers in the local comic shop for people to take, but still I've got very little in terms of local readership.  I hope once I get the Gary and Ted collected book done, I can get a signing set up somewhere to help promote the strip, but that's a few months away.  I'm trying to tie the release with Fireball #2, which I just need to finish the lettering on.

Long story short, I'm offering free material to a newspaper that runs half page pictures of senior rec league hockey.  That can't be good for my self esteem. Maybe I need to start my own newspaper...."

I tried playing Metroid Prime Hunters online, which I lost every time.  I didn't get a single kill, or hit probably.  Maybe I should get past the third level in the game before I make any attempt at playing my DS in head to head contests.  Then again I'm not the most adept FPS player.  I'm afraid to try out Mario Kart and Tetris, I don't think I can handle any more defeats."

"event","I've been noticing that most of my posts to this thing are Gary and Ted related, but I do have other things on the pipeline.  Things like Fireball #2.  I have woefully ignored what I once considered the HyperWrench flagship property, but then I got caught up in the glamorous world of webcomics, and it kind of slid to the back burners for a few months, but now I think I'm back on track.  Or I though I was until I broke the nib off my inking pen.  It wasn't a big deal, but I couldn't find the exact nib I had before, but I thought I bought one that was close enough.  I was wrong.  The nib I got isn't fine enough, so my lines are coming out thicker than I want, and I don't have time to try and find a new one for like a week (the joys of working shift work to support your cartoonist dreams).  

All is not lost, I do have back up supplies, I just prefer the Speedball brand of ink accessories.  So, I'm still able to ink the remaining ten pages.  I can't wait to get issue two done, because then I can really get to the meat of the Fireball stories that I really want to start telling.  The first two issues are more setting up everything and a lot of exposition (though there is a bit of a brawl at the end of issue two).  

I already have Fireball #3 plotted and layed out, it's the return of a certain ""Monster Fighter"" that has been absent from the ""Brave New World"" that I've established with the re-launch of Fireball and the launch of Gary and Ted.

Also, join the <a href=""http://hyperwrench.com/forum"">HyperWrench Message Boards</a>, I need the members and pretty much anything goes around there (I hear the site admin's a complete loon)."

That's right I want you loyal members of the HyperWrench Howlin' Commadoes to go forth and preach the gospel.  And that's the contest.  Go out and do whatever you can think of the help promote Gary and Ted.  Put up posters around your school, town, or cell block.  Streek with the URL of the site painted on your backside.  Go on your local radio station and pretend you're me (bonus points if you're female).  Come up with your own as long as it's not to illegal and doesn't some how get me indited, go right a head.  Now it wouldn't be right if I didn't give a bit of incentive to preform such acts, so to the Howler who brings in the most visitors gets the following:<br />
												  <ul>
												    <li>A guest appearence in a future ""Gary & Ted"" strip</li>
													<li>A signed copy of ""Fireball #1""</li>
													<li>A sketch of anything by your's truly (Note: May need to provide a reference)</li>
													<li>Anything else I can find lying around</li>
													</ul>
													</p>
													<p>And that's it.  All you need to do is promote and provide some sort of proof of your act (photo, video, scars).  All photos and such will be put up on the site as well, so there is some more incentive.  I'm not sending you out there unarmed.  I've provided a poster by which you can promote available in two versions <a href=""http://garyandted.hyperwrench.com/images/madness_colour.jpg"">Color</a> and <a href=""http://garyandted.hyperwrench.com/images/madness_bw.jpg"">Black and White</a> (warning large files).

I opened my Hotmail account to find that every bid I had on other sites were canceled.  Going to their site trying to figure out what went wrong.  It turns out that Project Wonderful changed the rules about bids of $0.0 can only be made for a max of two days.  And I couldn't be happier.  Mostly because it will make those making bids on sites to either put up or shut up.  Want to advertise on my page, now you can no longer freeload.  Now before you get upset and yell at me for being a ""money grubbing capitalist"", the bidding starts at $0.10.  That's right a dime.

"event","On my regular trip to Ye Olde Comic Shoppe, I discovered a pile of ""used"" comics (though they looked like they were never touched).  I'm such a bin whore.  I love cheap, bin comics.  They're usually trade ins that the store couldn't put on their racks, due to either condition or over stock, get sold at a reduced price.  The Tramps on 8th street in Saskatoon had bins where you could get ten comics for five bucks.  I found so many awesome books in there, like original ""Lone Wolf & Cub"" books with the Frank Miller covers, 10 of the 12 issues of the original Squadron Supreme, the Epic translations of Akira, and half of the entire West Coast Avengers series (which being the huge Avengers fanboy that I am, I was quite pleased).  But today I found this:

It was so bad, I couldn't finish it.  I could do better than this.  Things like this make me wish I was born 15 years ago, I could totally be drawing a third string comic title for a third string comic publisher, Hell I could probably doing fill ins on third string books for Marvel at the time.  X-Men, no way.  Wonder Man, I'd be all over that."

Any way, I write and draw crap, a lot of crap, more crap than the monkey house at the zoo.  For starters I write and draw a super-hero comic called Fireball, you can buy that at a few stores around Saskatchewan or <a href=""http://www.comixpress.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=725"">on line</a>
I also write and draw a weekly web comic, <a href=""garyandted.hyperwrench.com"">The Misadventures of Gary and Ted</a>.  Both local ""news papers"" won't print it (I e-mailed them, they never answered me) I shill these two products when ever I can, you've been warned.

I spend my time drawing these two things and working to move out of my backwater ""city"".  Why am I working to move out of my backwater ""city"", simple, no jobs.  Not one.  Well, to be more specific, no jobs that pertain to my skill set.  I'd love to be a graphic designer, but there are no opportunities for that type of work here.  I try to do as much freelancing as I can, but what I think I should be paid and what I'm offered are completely different (I'm thinking thousands, they're thinking hundreds or not at all).

And now I really have nothing else to say, this will probably be the longest post I'll ever do, expect less words and more crudely drawn pictures in the future."

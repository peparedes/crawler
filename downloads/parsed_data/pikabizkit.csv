<b>Love, Laura a.k.a. PiKaBiZKiT a.k.a. 'DAT BITCH</b>
</center>

Let me tell YOU, how much I HATE the immature little shits on Halo. If you're not interested, or hate profanity, don't progress reading in this particular entry.

<lj-cut text=""FLAG CAPTURED! You know the drill."">

When Halo was first released, I wasn't really into it. For one, I didn't really like the Xbox. The controller? Ew. But then I decided to get an Xbox as a Christmas present since I already had all the other current systems, and I got Xbox Live a few days later. I was hooked. 

Halo was actually a good game. The campaign is intense to me, and everyone and their mom has played multiplayer at least once in their life. Fun times, sure? Now take that experience of playing with your friends and add a mass amount of stupidity and retardation times 1000. This is what you get playing Halo 2 and 3 over Xbox Live.

I got in through the first round of online pickings in the Rule of 3. Sweet! This is gonna be awesome. Only a few amount of people are going to be in the Beta! Less immaturity! But wait! I want my friends to play too who didn't get in through Rule of 3.. wait! They can buy Crackdown and play that way! Awesome! WAIT! THAT MEANS ALL THE RETARDS AND ASSHOLES ARE GOING TO GET TO PLAY WITH US TOO!? ... WAIT! This is gonna blow chunks.

They let the Rule of 3 kids hop on at 12 AM my time Wednesday morning. Crackdown people had to wait until 5 AM, and even then Bungie had problems. Go figure, it's a beta and some problems are going to arise somewhere. Colin heads over here to my place and we hop on to play. Searching for matches, only 200 people are online at the time playing our particular game type. We met some cool kids, and it was actually an enjoyable experience playing Halo online once again. I stopped playing Halo 2 almost a year ago to the day because the idiot to human being ratio just got out of control.

I start playing Halo 3 last night with my friends, and we're having a great time. Then people start dumping out because they have to go to work in the morning. Oh boy. Time to go into matches with other random people because I still want to play.

Then it hit. I was bombarded with retarded comments such as ""YEAH, YOU LIKE DAT BITCH!"" and ""OH YEAH BABY GIRL, I GEEV YOU SOMMA'DIS!"" All while they hump my spartan's corpse. This just really frustrates me. And I know, I could simply mute them or completely ignore them. But that's just not me. I cave in to immaturity with rage and start shouting back my own ""fuck you's"". Why am I such a defensive person when it comes to everything?

Maybe it's because one of my favorite hobbies is filled with penis and testosterone. All through elementary school, middle school, high school, and from friends and family - have I been teased or thought of as ""different"" just because I play games electronically, on a TV screen. Why? 

Because I have a vagina. And boobs.

It's a sexist genre of interest, and I (as well as other females) become the target of the immature frat's out there in the online world. It's like as if you put me in an actual room with these 'tards, and they'd throw rocks like 4 year old's or get me to try and drink their Bud light just to have sex with them. 

One thing's for sure though.

It totally sucks being a girl who has genuinely loved and played games her whole life. I'm never taken seriously. If I had a penis though, I bet I wouldn't be picked on or hit on as much as I am now.

So what's that? Stop bitching about it, Laura? Only play games with your friends and forget those idiot assholes out there in the online world?
Sure, I will. I just wish things could be a little more mature and fun in Halo. My time playing Gears online was never near this much faggy as my few hours on Halo this morning.

Ever seen the movie ""Idiocracy""? I truly believe that's how our future is gonna end up without a doubt. </lj-cut>

Here's my Pokemon friend code stuffs. It's taken me forever to get it up, but I was focusing on beating the game first. 

<b>Pokemon Diamond
Player: PiKa
Code: 4596-6085-1215</b>

Gimme yours too! :3

I've been hearing rumors for a while that Japanese people were trading awesome Pokemon for shitty American ones. So I signed onto the GTS last night for the first time, and found that the Japanese trainers are actually asking for some really rare high level American Pokemon, in exchange for level 16 Japanese Pikachu's. Sigh. :(

Let me know if any of you guys have gotten any good deals in trading, or had any good battles. I'm curious to see what the competition is like. Oh, and voice chat. Does it actually work, or is my connection just being silly? ._.

Oh yeah, I also have <b><i>Pokerus</b></i>. YOM YOM YUM!! :3 LEMME KNOW IF YOU WANT THE SWEETNESS OF THIS DISEASE TOO! A friend of mine caught it from a random wild pokemon in his game, and my Pokermans caught it from his.

beeeee. :V"

There will be some serious dirty, chunky, bloody love-making tonight. Anyone who wants to join, hit me up on Live. :3

I know Annex is just like King of the Hill in Halo, but I really can't wait to play this in Gears. I'm glad it'll be coming out today. I really needed a picker-upper, and killing people violently over territory sounds yummy.
I was always a big team person in the Halo games, and this was one of my favorite game types. Gears just seems to make it sexier. In that gross, sexy blood-spattering way. 

Seeing bodies fly in multiple directions in Halo makes me giggle, but obscene body explosions in Gears also makes me feel tingly inside. <3"

"event","So I logged onto Myspace today, and I had new friend requests. ""Gee, what a surprise!"" - I thought to myself. Thinking it was going to be the usual bands or random guys just friending me because my relationship status says ""single"" -- I click it anyway deciding it's about that time to just delete everything out of it. 

But today, was a different friend request day. It was the day that I about pissed myself laughing at <b>WHO</b> wanted to be my friend.

<img src=""http://mydjsobad.bemanistyle.com/pika/frag.jpg"">

<lj-cut text=""Click here if you actually wanna read my bitching. Here's round number 2 on these slimy excuses for women."">

If these bitches knew how much I've bad mouthed them, I don't think they'd wanna be my pussy lesbian friend. I honestly have no idea why they want to be my ""friend"". Maybe because I'm a girl and I have one of my interests listed as being in video games? Or that my entire myspace layout is dedicated to Gears of War? Either way, I laughed. I laughed all the way to their pathetic Myspace page.

If you actually waste 5 seconds of your time looking at their page (Like I did. And holy damn would I sell my soul to just get that 5 seconds back of my life right now.) You notice that they have a few 360 Gamer cards up on the left side. Unfortunately, the highest Gamerscore on there is in the 3000's. 

Now, lemme get this straight. I can't throw my Gamerscore around either, as it's only 1400 something right now. Reason being? Because I really don't play that many 360 games. The highest points I have in any game is Gears of War. That's one of the only games I've actually played the hell out of on that system. I love the 360, but until recently have I actually had multiple nights off from work and school to actually sit down and stay up until 5 AM playing a game. The rest of the time it's something on my DS or gameboy, or I bust out one of my older beloved games on the N64, SNES, Genesis.. you get the idea. I've even been debating on playing StarCraft again for the past couple of weeks.

<i>ANYWAY.</i>

What I'm trying to say - is why do they have such low Gamerscores? I have mixed feelings about the Gamerscore aspect, but don't these women get PAID to play games? Maybe I'm just being too harsh or something.. or a raging bitch for all that matters. But if I had the advantage of just playing games for a living because I had a vagina, I'd make myself look amazing. I'd strive to have those points up or just not post my Gamercard at all. This just makes them look pathetic in a way, as though they don't try to get achievements or don't play many games at all. Or maybe they do play games, but not 360 ones. But doesn't UbiSoft (the company these 'tards get paid by) make 360 games as well? A retarded walrus could get achievement points on some games, especially EA ones. Why don't they have the high count if this is their ""job""?

I'd like to point out my good co-worker and magnificient friend Erin. This woman is a 360 gaming machine. She has almost 12,000 gamer points, and plays games often. She's a girl, a very cute one at that, and knows her shit. Why can't girls like her represent girl gamers instead of these lousy ""dolls""? Honestly though, I would've never liked to of seen things like the ""Frag Dolls"" or the ""PMS Clan"", or failed TV stations such as G4. I've always been seen as the quiet girl who talked about video games and no one thought I was incredibly special. I don't like other people getting money for things that I've been doing just by choice for my entire life, and also so happen to have the same sexual organs as I. Being a girl who plays games makes me seem ""different"" to some other shallow people. But I never got a single dime from it. Nor would I ever want to - I don't want to seem cool just for my tastes in hobbies or different in them because I'm a girl. Most of all, I just don't like posers or girls who say they like games to look ""cool"". That was never a bother in my life until about 3 years ago. I guess it's just <i>cool</i> to be a gamer <b>now</b>. What I'd give to go back to those days when it wasn't that cool to be a gamer, and the people into it were few and fun.

Maybe I'm just looking into it too hard and being mean. I'm actually coming down from being completely drunk earlier, and I think I just needed to vent for no reason.

So the moral of the story here, kids? I hate the Frag Dolls. They're a mockery of actual girl gamers and make us look stupid and ugly. I'm offended that they would even request me to be a friend of theirs. Did anyone else get this friend request because maybe they had the key phrase ""video games"" in their interests section? I'm just being a huge hairy butthole right now. Either way, it just bothered me to see their name in some sort of inbox of mine. But the real problem I have is that they exist. If you're confused at all, just go a little earlier in my entries and find the one with the subject <b>""FRAGGIN' UGLY""</b>. You might understand the rage I felt, and why I peed a little.

I bet Quagmire on Family Guy has herpes. :("

With new adventures, more advanced gameplay and hundreds more monsters than ever before, the series has proven its staying power. It wouldn't surprise us to see Pokemon still staying active for another full decade - because we still gotta catch 'em all.</b></i>


<i>Dear Pokemon,
I'll love you always, forever and ever.
Love, 
Laura</i>

So IGN decided to do another little quirky story about a series of games. And this time, they take a look back at the TEN years of <b>Pokemon</b> and all its glory. (And some not so glory.. like Colosseum and Gale of Darkness. BLECK.)

Anywho, I thought it was a cute little wrap-up of the games, as we sit patiently waiting for Diamond and Pearl. Take a gander, and enjoy!

http://ds.ign.com/articles/735/735858p1.html

When I started my obsession of Pokemon the day Pokemon Red was released, my Mom once said, ""I don't know what you're gonna do with all this stuff a few years down the line. You're not even going to care about it soon enough."" (Talking about the plushies, toys, and all numerous things that were released stateside at the time that was POKEEMONS that I owned.)

Well, Mom, there are many things that I have never been able to prove you wrong on. But with Pokemon, I've surely been loving it for more than those many years down the line since I was 13. And at almost 22 years old, I don't plan on stopping any time soon. :)

Cheers to Pokemon and it's reign of power with sweet games. Diamond and Pearl, we await your arrival with much love and anticipation."

"event","For this quarter at my college, I'm taking a Film & Society class on Friday afternoons. My teacher is an awesome guy, but when our class was told last week that we were REQUIRED to go see the movie ""World Trade Center"", I thought this was kind of rough. Rough in the sense that I didn't really wanna see it, and I think Hollywood did it to just get some more money off of a horrific tragedy.
Final thought? <b>They kind of did, but then didn't.</b>
The message is right in ""World Trade Center"". But it only makes us Americans more gullible to believe that this was just an attack and that everything will be solved once Osama is caught. But I never thought that was the full story.

As another requirement by our teacher, he told us to watch the documentary on the net known as <b>""Loose Change""</b>. This documentary done by a 21 year old about the conspiracy of the government being behind the whole 9/11 bullshit, is pretty believable in my opinion.

If you have a little free time, or just want to feel a little more enlightened about this ""conspiracy"", I suggest you take a gander. It's an hour long, split into two 30-minute wmv's. <b>PLEASE</b> watch this if you've ever had any doubt about the stories we've been fed about this national tragedy. It hits the target.

<b>Part 1</b>
http://www.question911.com/linkout.php?filename=911%20Made%20In%20The%20USA%20with%20Loose%20Change%201of4.wmv

Call me crazy or nutty. Or say ""Geez Laura, why are you being serious?"" Well, it's something that I've been wondering about since 2001. And I think it pretty much answered my questions about the stupidity of that day. You can laugh at it, or think that it's absolute blasphemy. But America is dumb and ignorant, and I'm sure most people can agree with that at least. I'm no anarchist by any means, nor do I ever really have any political views. This is just something to think about, and it's a good and interesting film with some pretty sweet music.

"event","This week was my measly one week ""Spring Break"" from school. And here it is at 10:30 Saturday night, and it's pretty much over. 
For those of you around me, this week wasn't even really a spring break for me at all. It was dubbed <b>""Pokemon Week""</b>. Why so? Because The 10th Anniversary of Pokemon or ""JAA"" (Journey Across America) is taking place as of now. Fortunately, they stopped in a little town around here called Los Angeles. Or to be exact, West Covina. 

<lj-cut text=""If you're interested, click for my journey on the road to Viridian City."">

<br>
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b287/pikabizkit/poke1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""GROUDON EAT MY FACE""></a>
<br>

Okay, Pokemon joke there. ""On the road to West Covina"" sounds more like my spring break. God, I'm such a dork. But once I get through telling you my story about my experiences at the Pokemon Video Game Championship, you'll think I'm social cherry pie.

First off, I was too caught up in my finals to actually work on my Pokemon getting them to level 100 when I first signed up for the Pokemon Video Game Championship contest. This was about 2 or 3 weeks ago. Now that I had my spring break, I had an entire week to get my Pokemon team set up and ready to go for this tournament that happened today, April 1st. Many trades and about 60 hours of my life later, I had my team all at level 100 and ready to kick some serious ass. Venusaur, Entei, Mewtwo, Pidgeot, Raichu, and Walrein were hauling complete ass in my FireRed. Walrein finally achieved Lv. 100 at 2:00 AM Saturday morning. So I went to sleep ready to go and get my Pokemon on.

We get to West Covina MALL (yes, mall, barf) at about 10 AM. I get Celebi and some of the Top 20 Pokemon, chosen blatantly by 5 year olds who obviously want a free download of a Pikachu. Which you know, is quite impossible to catch in any Pokemon game. (I'm kidding for those who don't know this.) But Latios and Latias were in there, so it was okay. Anywho, we watch the 12 and under age group tournament finish, and it was quite a good battle. And I died a little inside when I saw the First prize winner and the Runner-Up get Gameboy Micro Pikachu editions. 

Anywho, time for my turn. As I was standing in line waiting to get my nametag and registered in, I get this sinking feeling that I'm just not ""that into"" Pokemon. What I mean, is that the kids behind me were all wearing home-made Pokemon hats shaped into various Pokemon, and calling everyone around them n00bs as they tried to swap trainer cards with the very attractive people around them. (I'm kidding, again.) 

What really got me, was that I just had no idea that this many older people were actually still into Pokemon. Ever since I started playing at the age of 13, I've never had a group of friends or much anyone around me that's really been into Pokemon. As it goes, that still is true today. But for some reason, these older, less attractive, and socially inept people at this tournament found each other to be ugly and Pokemon crazy together. 

<b>Hold a sec, I'm not calling all Pokemon lovers ugly here. But listen to me straight, there are NO video game tournaments that harbor beautiful people. </b>

Anywho, more standing around and loathing the unsightly beasts around me; the tournament begins. Group 1: Laura Goodman. Oh shits, it's my time to get my tail handed to me, nerd style.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b287/pikabizkit/poke2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""OH SHI-""></a>

See my face? That's the face of discontent. 

I walk up all giddy and girly to my opponent ""David Schumer"" or something. But he goes by the name of ""Eric"" in his Pokemon game. God. How original is that? Maybe he thought ""I hate my real name 'David'. I wish it were something less original, like 'Eric'."" But in fact our dear ""Eric"" failed again by picking a default name. You rat bastard turd. (Not to say I'm more original with my player name as ""PiKa"". But that's seriously been my nickname for many years. I got some leeway on this one, Eric-face.)

I try starting conversation, and being completely nice to the guy, but he seems to not want to respond to me at all. Or no, not even that, I think the bitch was just too shy to be against a girl. I'll say with utter and complete confidence and as a conceded bitch at the moment, ""I was the only semi-attractive girl competing in that tournament."" Don't believe me? 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b287/pikabizkit/alb.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""FUCK""></a>

Take a gander at the winner of the Albuquerque tournament. I've gouged my eyes out looking at that ghastly sight. Haha, Gastly. They say a picture can say a thousand words. But I don't want to type that all right now. You can do that yourself. But wouldn't you agree that she'd make a great internet meme? 

Short story long, I got my butt handed to me. I was only able to take down one of his Pokemon. ""David"" or ""Ericwtf"" used Protect almost every turn to keep my onslaught of attacks off of his serious Pokemon ass.

One thing I learned from all of this, Pokemon is serious business. 

And by serious, I mean people probably lock themselves in their parents' basements and play Pokemon 24/7 so they could someday shine.
Well ""Eric"", you shined today. And by shine, I mean you won one for those socially inept losers out there. I have my own apartment, go to college, and I've been laid. Good job, bucko.

Okay, so maybe I'm a little too mean about it. I'm seriously not upset about it, it was moreso just a shock to see people my age and older THAT obsessed with Pokemon. Come on, I love it too, but GOD DAMN are you sad beings to be existing on our dimensional plane. 

All in all, I had a fun time. I got some cool 10 Anniversary stuff and I'm glad I competed - even though I lost first round. Because ever since I first played Pokemon Red back since the day it was released, I've always wanted to compete in an official tournament. So at 21 years old, I finally obtained that goal 8 years later.

Oh yeah, and tomorrow I'll have my rant up about phobias of other women.


Haha, April Fool's. :)

That'll come sometime later. :(

My phobia of other women. Yep, I think I have a nice little nugget right here.

But wait, it's not all about me. That'd just be boring. So it's really a rant about the dislike of my sex. 

I'm not saying I dislike any of my actual ""girl"" friends at all. If we hang out or you're on my friend's list, you're definitely a sweet person. I like girls, I just really hate the majority I don't know. Hoho, I'm a jerk.

"event","It's been a while since I last updated, what with my huge rant to last me a few good months. But here I am, enjoying my break from school. And now I'm gonna continue to enjoy it - so - I leave you with a rant by my good friend of T-Shirt Hell. Another amazing rant about how useless children are. I posted his first rant about the maniacal midgets quite a few months ago, but to my joy, he has done it again with a following up of the stupidity of our youth today.

""...As for my other haunts, the truth of the matter is I have a deep and abiding
hatred of children.  Now, you may remember several months ago I wrote an
article asking people to stop having children.  But it didn't really address
what to do about the ones that are already here.

Here is my 5 point plan for dealing with children.  Children are defined as
anyone below the age of 12.  Exceptions are made for girls 10 and above who
bloomed early.

1.  There should be a mandatory curfew for children.  They should only be
allowed in public from 3-5pm Monday-Friday; and 11am -6pm on the weekend.
While they are in public, the parents are responsible for having some way to
entertain them.  A portable DVD player with earphones is great.  Any clear
plastic bag is an economical alternative.  Don't give your child a noisy
handheld video game: it's like handing the child a drum or a fistful of
fireworks.  While, I have no problem with you giving your child a fistful of
fireworks, I just ask that you do it at home.

2.  One child is allowed in public per adult supervisor.  No more field
trips, no more haggard women towing 5 screaming kids through the mall.  If
you're pregnant that counts as your 1 kid.

3.  Children are not allowed in movie theatres, or restaurants.  The only
exceptions being themed restaurants, fast food joints, G-rated movies, or
anything with Sandra Bullock.

4.  Children in public need to be drugged to make them quiet and compliant.
Parents who do not want to drug their children must physically restrain
them.  They need to be muzzled, and strapped down to handcarts; sort of like
how they used to wheel Hannibal Lecter around in, ""Silence of the Lambs"".

5.  Children not restrained (see above) will be equipped with leashes and
shock collars.  The controls for the shock collars will be publicly
available.  Anyone seeing a misbehaving child will have the ability to
activate the shock collars.

Parents and children unwilling to follow these rules will be sent to labor
camps where they will sew t-shirts, or build shock collars and handcarts.
The other option for parents who don't want to follow these rules is to
leave their children at home when they go out.  That's why God made TV, and
books of matches.

So in closing, please write to your congressman, representative, or local
warlord, and tell them you want them to endorse the T-Shirt Hell Childcare
Act of 2005.""

GENIUS. I LOVE YOU.

Again, I plea with you to go find yourself some kind of disgusting shirt that will fit you properly at:
--> http://www.tshirthell.com <--

I've bought a few from there. :) And boy-howdy, I remind you I hate annoying children, very, very, very much.  Well, I hate just about anything that involves a child and a prissy, self-absorbed girl.

Here I sit in a rage. And I think I'll state my thoughts on a little group of girls, called the ""Frag Dolls"".
I could choose to be short and sweet, and just end this entry with a ""THEY'RE ALL FUGLY AND ONLY TOUCH AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE WITH THE PROMISE OF GETTIN SOME CASH MONEY OUT OF IT. THE END.""

But guess what. I'M NOT GONNA END IT THAT QUICK. So stop reading now if you got the point I'm going to make already. :)

<lj-cut text=""CLICK FOR MORE OF MY ANGER"">

When I first heard about these blasphemous witches called the ""Frag Dolls"", I didn't think that much of it. But with the recent upbringings of the silly Chobot girl on IGN, my thoughts have gotten a little more increased on this deadly subject of ""girl gamers"".

There are plenty of us out there. Some girls like to play games, and WHOAOMG it now seems as if it's some kind of act of God Almighty that something with a cootch touches an Xbox controller. Example, Frag Dolls. These 7 girls of questionable beauty are monopolizing on the fact that they've touched a game console - and they own a pussy. No, not the meow meow pussy, I mean the COOTER PUSSY that you FUCK. I hate these bitches. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't think that girls SHOULDN'T play games. For Chrissake *I* play them. But when it comes to the point of silly little boppy women throwing the fact around that they ""play"" games, I get angry. VERY ANGRY. Why? Well, I'll tell you.

As far back as I can possibly remember, I was playing Atari. From Atari, I played the Nintendo. From Nintendo, I went to the Genesis, GameBoy, GameGear, SNES, 32X.. and the list goes on. You gamer's know what I'm speaking of. :) I have ALWAYS been into games. Honestly, I can't remember any part or age of my life where I wasn't holding some kind of controller or handheld system. Alright, so I sound like a humongous dork right now, but I'm just letting you know. I LIKE VIDEO GAMES AND ALWAYS HAVE.

Now let's go to present day. Gaming is starting to become very TABOO in my mind. What with hideous stations on TV such as G4, and the mounds of people who come into GameStop to buy games - just because they think it's ""COOL"", or they'll be super amazing man for owning a particular game, or playing it. RESIDENT EVIL 4 DIDN'T EVEN GET A SINGLE FUCKING AWARD ON THE SHIT KNOWN AS G-PHORIA. MY FAITH HAS ALL BUT BEEN CRUSHED BY THE GAMING PUBLIC. YOU SILLY N00BS AND ASSHOLES.

Alright. So back onto the subject of girls in gaming. I don't doubt that some of the ""Frag Dolls"" like games, and do play them. I bet they don't play them anymore though, because they're wallowing in their buttloads of cash, and letting every single dork they meet fill their snatch's with hot greasy gamer cum. I just really dislike the fact that they are monopolizing on something of a minority. The way I see it, I think it's absolutely ridiculous. For example, I have Psoriasis. A skin disease that flairs up every once in a while in a person's life that causes them to have little red patches on their skin. Why don't I start up a huge group of people with Psoriasis, and tour America, and have big name companies that make medication for Psoriasis sponsor us. We'll then travel everywhere where people can oogle at our red patches of skin, and maybe even TOUCH it. WE'D BE SO AMAZINGLY COOL, BECAUSE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE PSORIASIS AND WE'RE SO GODDAMN SEXY WITH IT!

Okay, so that was WAY over the boundary. But, maybe you get what I'm saying. Or maybe you don't. Either way, I think it's stupid that girls throw themselves around to be hot shit because they touch a game controller. GO SCREW YOURSELVES WITH A CONTROLLER AND JUMP OFF A BUILDING. I PLAY THEM TOO, AND I'LL BET MY LIFE THAT I'M MORE HOT SHIT THAN YOU.

I'm only <u><b>honestly</u></b> kidding. But just because you look a little more attractive than the average fat gamer girl, doesn't mean you should get paid for it. And no, I'm not fat. I'm not doing this out of jealousy. I honestly just don't think any of them are that attractive. I've seen more awesome girls play games that look better than them. Oh, and I'll tell you one thing though. If *I* were a Frag Doll, I'd totally be the hottest one. Or if Stefanie joined too, we'd be the fucking uber-sweet hot bitches who play games. And I wouldn't want money. My only gratitude would be being able to kick your ass at Halo, Smash Brothers, or Guitar Freaks. Anything, really. :)

So to end my confusing and quite amusing piss on ugly girls and the taboo known as gaming, I'm gonna have a cigarette. And enjoy it greatly. And work on my Mid-terms. Then I'll play Pokemon or Animal Crossing until it's time to go to bed. <3

This one in particular, was AMAZING. This man sums up all of my thoughts on kids, since I really don't want any and they annoy me often. :3 ENJOY THE VICIOUSNESS!

""I hate kids.

I yearn for a world without any children.  It would be a world of quiet
airplanes, restaurants, and movie theatres:  a world without playgrounds,
circuses, and child proof caps.  Drug dealers could ply their trade wherever
they wanted, without having to worry about wandering into a school zone.
Adult book stores would just be called book stores.

Nobody wants kids for the sake of having kids.  Women want kids to prove
that they have working vaginas.  Having babies is the one thing us women
can do, besides field hockey, which no man can do at all, let alone do
better.

Ladies, if you want to impress people with your gash then shoot ping pong
balls out of it; or use it to pick up a stack of quarters.  Do you want to
dazzle them?  Then combine these two tricks as you sail through the exact
change lane on the turnpike.

Men want to have kids because they were picked last in gym class.  Or worse,
they were captain of the high school football team and led their team to the
State Title.  But then a freak masturbation accident cut their college
career short. Either way, they are determined to create little champions.
So, they put creatine in their kid's Captain Crunch, and dose their juice
boxes with anabolic steroids.

I don't care if your kid can jump over your house: it doesn't change the
fact that you're still a loser.  Now finish pumping my gas, and lick those
bugs off my windshield if you want a tip.  Your kid needs a pair of Adidas
1s doesn't he?

People have kids in the hopes that they will take care of them when they get
old.  Fat fucking chance.  Take the money you would have spent on
orthodontia, college, and rehab; and put it into a nice no-load mutual fund.
You'll be able to retire to a tropical island in your early fifties.  Then
let someone else's teenager bring you fruity drinks and give you a poolside
happy ending massage.

If you have kids now, it's not too late to get rid of them.  If you're still
living at home, it's never too early to leave and give your parents a chance
at happiness.  Sweatshops and street gangs are both excellent options.  Both
offer a child the opportunity to learn a trade, and room for advancement.
Both offer lifetime job security.  How many people have that?  If you're
afraid you'll miss your kid, just buy a PSP - I hear they're awesome.  They play
games, movies, and music.  Your kid can't play music and they had 5 years of
piano lessons.

Do you know what would happen if everyone stopped having kids? Nothing.
Nothing would happen.  The last generation would enjoy seventy years of
peace and quiet.  Human civilization would end?  So what?  Why do you care?
You'll be dead either way.  I hear that ferrets are pretty smart - let's give
them a chance to run the planet.  If you're the last person on earth
just remember to turn out the lights.""

<3<3 I love this. HAHA!

Oh yeah, to anyone who has kids or wants kids - Sorry XD!! I just found it kind of funny, and hope you have the humor to giggle a little too. :3~

He said that GameStop was only allowing a certain amount of their employees from each district to go. So I guess I didn't get in in time. :( Oh well, hopefully my manager will help me get in or I can get in some other way - i.e. from School or have some hook-ups from somebody else. :3 <3<3

Anywho, see you Cali-sillies soon! :D~
<3<3
whee!"

"event","So I was having TERRIBLE pains on the right side of my tummy yesterday and a few days before. I didn't really think that much of it seeing as I just thought I wasn't eating right. 
Yesterday around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, I got an ever SHARPER and GRUESOME pain in my tummy again. And this time it didn't go away. :( I did a few errands and then eventually threw up.
I went to the Emergency Room around 9:30 PM and didn't get out until 2 AM.

Problem?

KIDNEY STOOOOOOONE!!! 

I have a little fucker sitting in my kidney that is giving me all kinds of hell. (o;_;o) 
I'll be alright as long as I'm hopped up on my Vicodin.
Now I'll have to pee out the son of a bitch. BOY I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT FUN TIME.

Somebody please cut out my right kidney and sell it on the black market. You can keep the money, just GET THE LITTLE SHIT OUT. :("

Get your sweetie somethin good, like spackle to spiff up those holes you put in their room during that wild sex you had.

If no sweeties for you, go buy yourself a rose and put it under the tire of the car of the one you pine for. Then watch them run it over as they back out of the driveway and scream: ""THE ROSE IS LIKE MY LOVE FOR YOU, YOU SQUISH IT WITH NO CARE AND.. AND I LOVE YOU!!""
Proceed to then go to the petals of the shattered rose and eat them. While crying. On the ground. In the driveway.

Then they'll want you for your coolness cuzz you ate the rose. Then you'll have mad sex. So be sure to keep a good rose in your pocket so you can take it out later after the good sex and give it to him/her. That'll just top off the sundae like a cherry on cake.

My god do I feel stupid. Just go get chocolates or something. Like the Hershey commercial says, don't give roses cuzz that means you're a sorry wuss. Give chocolate cuzz it makes women horny. Or something. 

I feel retarded so I'm gonna watch EVIL DEAD now. :3"

"event","I got my tonsils cut out. Finally. 
WHAT a weird spell of a surgery that was. 
""Okay, I'm gonna turn up your I.V. a little bit and you'll be out in 10 seconds!""
""Huh..? I will?""
...(oX.Xo)...
yeah. I'd say I lasted about 7 seconds. 
Either way, those horrid little monsters that made the back of my throat look like a ball sack are gone. Yeah, that sounded really disgusting. :/
Now I am suffering the post-surgery thingy. Where like, I can't talk, or eat, or do anything really. This also includes no smoking. GOSH DAMN IT TO HELL. :( Oh well. I should be quitting soon anyway. :3~
My throat hurts like a son of a bitch. Like, there's a hole there, and.. there's a big hole. And.. I can't do anything about it. Except lie in my bed in utter terrible pain. :/
Oh well, my Christmas was cool and icey, but my New Year's sucked a donkey's ass. Like, I could've went down to Kristi's and watched Spiderman 2 and shot off fireworks. BUT NO. I had to be all tonsil-missing like and be sick. Well, maybe I'll get to do that when I get better. :)
As for now, I'll return to watching TV and being sad and hurtful in my tonsil-trials. 
I miss my Cali, but there's no place like home. <3"

I just wanted to re-instate that I HATE Xbox fan-peoples and really big cars/trucks/suvs/wtfwatevers and SCHOOL. :)

And umm.. what else is goin on.
I really hope that I'm able to get through at least 3 of my classes from last quarter. My fear is that I'll only get through 2, but here's hopin' and prayin' that I'll get that magic 3. HELP ME GOD. (o;_;o)
So here's to Christmas break in which I'm on right now. Though it really doesn't feel like it. I guess because I'm still waiting to record some of my Animation final and get my portfolio in for my Character Design class. At least my Animation teacher is cool as fuck and let us wait until next quarter to get things cleaned up. :3
And I get my tonsils out in about a week. ORAL SURGERY NOT SEX. THE FARTHEST THING FROM SEX. I HOPE I LIVE THROUGH IT. PLEASE LOVE ME NEXT WEDNESDAY THE 29TH. :(
It really doesn't feel like Christmas either. Ya know, what with the almost 80-degree days here in Cali. I'm used to fuckin' 19 or almost below zero temperatures back home. I mean, I'm not saying I miss that cold weather all that much, but geezus beezus did it let me know that it was fuckin' Christmas time! :D
We didn't get to go to SVGL due to some issues that arose. Either way, I'd rather wait and go when we had more time and were off work for more than one day. It would've killed my gas and wallet and would have made me get an oil change by the time I got back down here to So-Cal. Oh well, so goes my inane and unmapped life.
Our moving situation is being planned, but will be in effect soon hopefully. Here's to cheap moving trucks, mates.
ALSO, if I ever see that little fat kid in GameStop again spouting ""XBOX ROCKS GAMECUBE SUCKS"" chants again, I will fucking tear his chunky little head off and shove it down his lard-infested body. I was going to do that the night I saw him, but his Grandma was there with him. Ya know, can't let old G-mama seein that kind of violence from a little girl such as myself. 
I probably would have kicked her ass too.

I started around 3:30 A.M. and went all the way to 7. WTF.
I'm happy to be playing games so much again. :3 Even though I shouldn't because I'm starting Finals for school. Which REALLY SUCKS FAT ASS. I HATES SCHOOL.
I also got the preview disc to Resident Evil 4 from work the other day, since I pre-ordered the Collector's Edition of RE4. So frees for mes. :9~ 
It's FUCKING CREEPY AS FUCKTARDOM. WTF is up with these people in the town that Leon's investigating? COMPLETE MYSTERIES OMG!! It's SO COOL. AND SO FUCKING SCARY. I love the controls and the fact that you can actually and LITERALLY kick the shit out of these zombie crack-heads in the game rules. The GameCube totally shows its potential with this game. GameCube is a fuckingly powerful system, but sadly, it's the most over-looked amongst the consoles of today. I hope RE4 will show those fucktards that this system IS capable of beautiful things. Not to mention that it should kill the rumor of ""Gamecube's for babies!"" saying. I had my head fucking CHAINSAWED OFF by a fat-man JUST in the demo of RE4. I screamed loudly in a horrific manner.
Also, Capcom has announced that they will be making a line of clothing and cologne based off of Leon in Resident Evil 4. How silly is that? Okay, I thought it was sort of ridiculous when I heard about it at first too, but if I saw somebody like Leon walking down the street in that sort of wear, it's OVER. Give it up, he's a hot CG man. Just like your Rumble Roses ladies. Props to Capcom for making a hot man who shoots zombie-killing-wtfarethesepeople things. 
It should be ready on January 7th, online, at Capcom's E-Shop. At least I think that's what they said. 
Hotness to the gamer guys out there. :9 <3<3"

I own an Xbox, you twit. And am eating the living shit out of it on Live. Yeah, you better get Live. And hook me up dawg. I suck at Halo, but I make conversation on the microphone whilst I try and kill you. :3 So that makes me cool. Right? XD
Anyway. Gonna head to bed now and maybe catch a quick game of Halo 2 on Live before I sleep. 
Fuck, I'm addicted. :(
David got into a CRAZY car accident today. Took his entire front bumper off of his fucking hot Honda. It happened around 5 in the afternoon. But when did *I* find out about it? Around 11:30 at night. I was sorta distressed, but well, I guess if I had gotten into an accident like that I'd be pretty shitty and not wanna talk about it either. :*( Hot damn money sucks.
I opened Eddie's McDonald's Sonic toy from his Happy Meal today too. He got mads at me. :(

"event","So Eddie and I decided to break down and get an Xbox. We are now up-to-date in the ""CONSOLE WARS"" in the fact that we own every single fucking system that has ever existed in this world. If that even makes sense.
I like the Xbox. I like the GameCube. I like the PS2. I like the DS. For fucks sake, I still love my N64 and Genesis. I LOVE IT ALL.
But you know what I don't like? That contrapted phrase ""CONSOLE WAR"". And other comments such as ""MY SYSTEM IS BETTER."" or ""MY SYSTEM COULD EAT YOUR SYSTEMS FACE.""
So goes my rant that I have been DYING to ensue for months. 
I work at GameStop, as most people know, who know me. It's not every day that I go into work and hear something along the lines of ""XBOX IS BEST"" or ""XBOX EATS YOUR SYSTEMS ASS"", and ""GAMECUBE IS FOR BABIES"" or ""GAMECUBE IS HORRIBLE!"". It is people like this that really make me hate the gaming world. WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK WHOSE SYSTEM IS BETTER, THEY'RE ALL FUCKING GOOD.
I REALLY hate those people. Okay, so a lot of my friends/co-workers are in this genre, but I give them a leave here. Because you're my friend. :3
I go to work or school and hear people talk about how good Xbox is and how Nintendo sucks, or something along those lines. GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK. Xbox IS a good system, don't get me wrong, I just cannot stand the fact that it unfortunately has the most following of morons I have ever seen a system have. It seems that our gaming world is now going mainstream. What with shit channels like G4 on the air. Which is nothing but a huge Electronics Boutique (EB) commercial. I hear THEM even slander the GameCube and Nintendo. HOW TASTELESS IS THAT!?!?!? The only thing I've seen them like so far from Nintendo is the DS. For good reasons, it's a fun system. And I would go into the fact that I hate it when people argue the PSP over the DS too, but I'll only get more frustrated with you. 
One thing that really bothered me the most, was the non-hype over Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. FUCKING PLAY IT YOU FUCKS. This game is an incredible piece of sex and artwork all rolled into a tiny disc that you play in your Cube. I mean, I have only been able to play about 2 hours in, but I am completely blown away by it already. Actually, I was blown away from the moment I turned that sucker on. 
It's like our ""Gaming World"" is now turning into some kind of fashion scene or some shit. What with Microsoft having money out the ass and buying people for shitloads. People buy what they see and think is the most popular. But that doesn't mean that it's the best thing out there. 
This really saddens me. I really hate to see morons walk into GameStop and buy games that they don't even know what they are. What happened to the good old days. Ya know, where if you saw a video game commercial on TV, it was astronomical. Remember those old Super Mario Kart commercials? The first Super Smash Bros. commercial? THE SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3 ONE!? RELEASED ON HEDGEHOG DAY!?
MY FUCK I'm such a dork. But I know the systems and games and love them all, no matter who makes them. 
I mean c'mon, *I* used to be all over Sega's balls way back in the day. I was a complete Sega fangirl. Until Super Mario Kart came out. THEN I started kissing ass so I could get an SNES. But you know what? I was like fucking 10 years old and complaining with other kids about whose system was better. The day I saw Sega and Nintendo's names on the same screen, was the day I found it useless to complain who was the better. Now at 20 years old I see 10 to 40 year olds fighting over how good Xbox is or whatever what the fuck. GROW UP. JUST PLAY YOUR SYSTEM AND BE HAPPY AND LIKE IT!
DON'T TELL ME HOW BAD ANOTHER ONE IS, BECAUSE IT ONLY MAKES ME ANGRY. ANGRY!!!
I would go into how big of a crock Halo is, but I'll leave that alone. I LIKE HALO. I PLAY HALO. But for the fact that it over-shadowed so many other great games this season (and in my opinion, wasn't as good as it was hyped to be) just makes me so angry. When I'm going to 7-11 to get a slurpee and I see HALO SLURPEE CUPS, this pisses me off. WTF MICROSFTS.
Alright. So that didn't really make much sense. But it's long and I think I feel a little better. Even though I know that this little post will not change the average gamer's mind, at least I know that I think lovingly. I love all of it. So you should too.

"event","OKAY, so I woke up this morning to take Eddie to work. As I pulled out of the apartments onto the main road of Magnolia, TWO CARS CAME FLYING AT ME LIKE WTFOMG :(!! From the left that is. I guess the reason I didn't see them was cuzz I was really tired and still couldn't see completely correct, but DAMN. They came out of no where.
For some reason, I just wasn't scared. I knew I'd get by and not get hit. But MOTHERFUCK was it weird. Eddie just sat there just as shocked. 8) I sped outta the way and got into the turning lane as I heard honking and tires screeching like WHAT. I kid you not, as if you pass by my apartment you will see a good 15-20 foot skid mark on the road of the guy who must have shit his pants and tried to stop his car because of me.
BUT IT WASN'T ALL MY FAULT!
I'm a decent driver. I'm not TERRIFFIC, but I can drive my car better than most asians. :3
The reason.
The car that was hiding that little car that almost hit me was a fucking FAMILY VAN.
I HATE LARGE CARS/SUVS/WHATEVERS.
It's so fucking stupid to drive such large vehicles on the road. Okay, so it's cool to have a huge car because you feel cool as fuck and bigger and better than everyone else on the road. But what about the little people like me, with little Honda Civics?
My Civic could kick the shit out of your large car/van/suv/WTFWHATEVER and eat it too. Just because it's a Civic.
I don't think they should allow large VEHICLES on the fucking road. I don't know how many countless accidents I've come close to, just because I couldn't see that pedestrian walking on the other side, or that other little car thats following close behind a LARGE MOTHAFUCKA. 
Don't even get me started on BUSES. 
UGH.
FUCK YOU PEOPLE WITH BIG CAR THINGS :( YOU CAUSE THE WORLD OF TRANSPORTATING PEOPLE TO DIE

I don't mean this seriously to the people I know with large VEHICKLES. BECAUSE YOU *CAN* DRIVE."

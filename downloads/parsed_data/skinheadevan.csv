"event","the blind society/virus show was alright...the virus was terrile but it was alright since blind society was there...they are great...there were to many mall punkcore type kids there..me and chris were called assholes by the virus for telling an oepning mall punk little kid band to go back to the mall....im still tryin to get a new band together but nothing seems to be happening since chris is no longer interested in good music and all he wants to do is be in a thrash band...grrr...i wish the decepticons were still together..we were just startin to get really good too...so thats about it..see yall chap lata..cheers"

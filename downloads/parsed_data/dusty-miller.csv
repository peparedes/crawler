I have a new to me desk.  My grandma is officially moving and with that decision, much of her furniture had to go.  In the process, she was nice enough to hire movers to move the solid oak desk that's been in the family since the 50's and bring it to our house.  It's beautiful.  Fidget seems to like it too. :)"

This past weekend was a productive one.  Saturday, I finished organizing the remains of all my belongings that were at my parents home.  I officially have NOTHING at their place anymore.  Kind of a strange feeling I can't put my finger on just yet.

Sarah and I also caught a free concert by a group we both like a lot, the Spaghetti Western String Co. (though the name does not hold true as they do have a wonderful clarinetist).

Sunday, Sarah (I helped trim trees and our overgrown plants) tore apart the front yard on the side of the house to put in about 15 shade plants that she got for free from our friend.  She spent most of the day doing that with occasional breaks for food and water.  Her thought is ""the less yard, the better.""  Less mowing, etc.  The landscaping she has done in the front/back yard since she moved in is really quite nice.  She really puts her back into the work.

Tonight we have ""date night"" so I think we're going to go for a bike ride.

Other news:  Tomorrow, I begin teaching band camp for the week.  In the morning, I have 3 back to back classes of 5 students each, teaching beginning trumpet from day 1.  In the afternoon, I teach trumpet ensemble (about 20-25 trumpets at once) for 7th/8th grade and also a beginning Jazz Improvisation class (co-taught) to all of 8th grade I think (however many students are in the 8th grade band).  Friday will be different because there will be 2 concerts, one for the 6th graders in the late morning, and one for the 7/8 and staff in the afternoon.  

~~
Today, I have a gig with the Riverside Swing Band (www.myspace.com/theriversideswingband) at Marine on St.Croix (near Stillwater) at The Brookside Bar on their outside stage.  It is free and from 2-5.  Old Swing, New Swing, a little pop and Latin, some straight-ahead jazz....it's a fun gig.  It's our last outside summer gig of the summer.

Went to the Farmers' Market this morning in MPLS with Sarah.  Got a little bit dizzy feeling too constricted and a little uncomfy with the crowd.  We did come home with plenty of yummy food to cook with.  Speaking of food, I've been on a Cold Press kick for awhile now... making it at home is nice."

Random tidbits:

I've been having a lot of fun with my new used horn with the new mouthpiece and the Jason Harrelson trim kit.  In the meantime, selling my C tpt and piccolo and saving my gig money to get the Bravura trumpet made by Jason Harrelson... :)

A few weeks ago I went to Madison (Waunakee for the class) to learn the Sibelius 5 music software inside and out.  It was a lot of work and great fun.  I was really excited to come home and continue to learn/use it on my home computer but have discovered I have NO TIME yet!  I'll get there though.

Gigging.  It's been fun this summer...sometimes I have a couple of gigs in a week and it really keeps me on my toes.  I'm really starting to dig in to deeper jazz theory and I find it stretches my brain and my playing technique.  Maybe when I'm like 60 I'll feel like I have this instrument down...hahaha.... luckily, the trip itself is intrinsically rewarding along the way.

S and I went to the family cabin ""up north"" last weekend for nearly 2 days... way too short, but was nice.  I like reveling in nature and the silence.  

Our sick cat (been sick for months now) seems to be on the upswing... so we may have helped turn the liver failure around.  She is just EXTREMELY annoying now... constantly meowing and ""in your face.""  She also does these little soft bites that says ""HEY, I don't like you, but I like you, but ...awww, I'm just gonna bite you now...take that!""  Nothing satisfies her and she is constantly underfoot.  Not sure what to do about this.

Teaching.  Starting to prep for school to start.  I think I have figured out a 2 day schedule to be at the middle school. (.3 position) This way I can be more open to sub in other districts/different schools to build up experience.  Aiming for a Full-time Band job the following school year.  Alongside teaching, I will continue to teach an assortment of instruments at CMS. I may be hired to teach at a new facility to teach in Circle Pines, MN.

Mentoring.  I've begun my program mentoring a high school student.  We will hang out tomorrow with the mass group of mentors/mentees at a Saints Game.  That will be my first experience at a Saints Game... tried once last year, but was rained out.  I like my mentee... she is a good kid and is eager to make a difference.  Should be a great year for her.

Finishing up my last couple of weeks at the coffee shop.  I will be helping out with String Camp at the Middle School next week and then teaching full-time for Band Camp week the following week.  The week after that is Professional Development week and then school starts!!!

I am hoping S. finds a new job that she likes within the next couple of months.  She is so tired of her job.  It makes her cranky and the light does not exist in her eyes.  It would be ideal for this to happen anytime now... before winter. Putting that out there to the universe.

Sugar.  S and I are on a little/no refined sugar diet.  So far, it's going great.  Mentally and physically, many benefits.

I've had the urge to play basketball...so much so that I went out and bought a basket ball.  I used to go shoot the BB a lot growing up.  Problem is being able to FIND a working BB hoop that isn't taken over by lots of men.  We live in a very diverse area where BB is quite popular... I might have a shot if I can find one not being used in the middle of the day...

Going to the library today! Yay!  And tonight, Riverside Swing Band gig."

"event","Well, I took a short ""break"" from LJ and have decided that I'm just not quite ready to pull the plug.  I discovered that I enjoyed reading about the happenings of neat people once and awhile.  So for now, I'll peek in now and again.

A lot has been happening around here, but some things off the top of my head:

~I finally got off of Cobra and have some form of crappy health insurance offered through the state.  It will do, for now.

~Brando, our cat is still sick with a liver problem.  Sarah has been force feeding her for nearly 4 weeks now.  Apparently, this could go on for awhile if she has a shot at making it.  In the meantime, the bathroom ends up very smelly/messy since that is where she feeds her...a puree of cat food and milk thistle.  Brando doesn't smell glorious either.  She just had a bath this morning.

~Finished the last month of long-term PT subbing in Hudson.  Lots of fun.  Got hired to be the full year long-term sub for middle school band in the fall (.3 position).

~Number of students this summer (private wind students) is increasing at Camden Music School.

~Registered to take 2 back to back courses in Madison at the Wisconsin Center for Music Education this July.  So, it will be about a 5 day stint away from home.  

~Still working the early morning barista shift for the summer.

~Gigging has increased.  I mainly play with the Riverside Swing Band and primarily do subbing for 3 other big bands in the cities.

~Excited to try out some new trumpets at the end of July for a Demo day of a local trumpet maker...Jason Harrelson.  
http://www.harrelsontrumpets.com/gallery.htm
Trumpet player or not, you should check his stuff out under ""Gallery"" link... they are ART and beautiful.  If I like, I will be saving my money... already am.  Plus, I'm selling my piccolo trumpet (German rotary) and C trumpet to help me pay for it.

~Currently reading ""Ender's Shadow.""  The last of the OSC books... though I know it is a parallel book to Ender's Game really.  I love it.  The whole series is damn good.

~Longboard.  I have a new one.  Bought the deck at the Art-a-whirl art show in NE and got the parts later.  It rides like butter... does butter ride well???  Huh.

~I miss my friends and am happy to say I will be making more time for them now.  Seems I've been off in la-la land for awhile."

"event","Hello LJ land.

Just wanted to give the heads up that in a few days, I will delete this journal.  I've been thinking about it for awhile (several years of journaling online between the two journals) and have come to the realization that I don't have the urge to really document my life online anymore.  Use to journal so that sometimes I would have something to look back on and reflect on happenings, but now, I want to be even more present and take things as they come.  If there are things I want to share or hear, I surely hope to share/hear them by phone or in-person.  I give this journal a few days for anyone who wants to contact me (besides the ones I already know will) to keep in touch in this world outside of LJ.
This online world provided great comfort and relief, joy and sadness.  It's been... appreciated.

Thanks,
Kaylynn"

Day 2 of not making it in to work.  Tomorrow I HAVE to go... should be okay enough to do so.

Today, I've been slow moving.  Read through a short memoir on Chet Baker and did some listening and playing with his ""Chat Baker & Crew* LP (World Pacific Records).  Trumpeting is okay...if I don't push it.  I have to play some because I have a 4 hr rehearsal on Sunday night to prep for.

"event","My favorite chicken passed on sometime yesterday.  Sarah discovered her in the doorway of the coop last night when we got home from our night out.  Her neck is apparently pretty wobbly, but no sign of major trauma.  We haven't been able to inspect the coop yet for further detail. I noticed the neighborhood cat stalking them (nothing unusual) again yesterday and the coop door was slightly ajar due to the weather (we were about to reconstruct the coop run door to make it more secure and easier to use).  My thought is that the cat got to her.  

I knew that this might happen... I just didn't think it would happen so soon and in this possible way.  I feel very sad.  She made me smile and laugh on a daily basis and was by far my most favorite chicken to watch... her wing feathers were pinned so close to her body that when she ran she looked like she was a chicken stump running with no arms.  It was a sight to see...

I am at work and want to cry.  Grr.

We plan to bury her in our backyard."

"event","I am supposed to go to Big Band rehearsal tonight but had to call in because 2 days ago Fidget ran straight into my bottom lip with her bony little cute head and bruised it.  The past 2 days of trumpet have suffered and I can feel that I needed one more day to do mid-range, long tones and easy playing.

Today, I brought over lunch to someone that S. cooked for her (a semi-stranger that upon meeting a couple of times happens to rub me the wrong way) who asked for help (we volunteered ourselves months ago to be on a list of helpers list for those who may need help at some point)... only I got there to visually see/get confused that she really didn't seem to ""need"" the help.  Pulling up to a huge house with a cleaning lady... I couldn't understand why her partner doesn't leave her lunch.  (She just had her foot operated on...so she's on crutches).  Is it bad that I don't have sympathy???  My grandma has had tons of surgery (complicated and painful ones too) and only asks for help when she truly needs it.  Not only that, but if she does receive help, she shows that she is grateful in her own way.   Now, I know I shouldn't be the judge on whether someone really truly needs help or not... but there it is... I'm judging.

In other realms... I am anxiously waiting for my Midi Keyboard and Sibelius 5 to arrive. :)

Friday night we had our friend J. over and after eating some broccoli, scrambled egg and hashbrowns...and baklavah, we putzed around with our wireless and he explained what we need to do to get it working properly.  YAY.  I proceeded to play with U Tube, watching many blips of Louis Prima and Keely Smith.  I would like to find/read a book on those two.  Apparently, he was abusive.  Sad.

Saturday morning, I had a rehearsal in Scandia, then came home to practice more, then headed over to Sarah's parents' house for Egg dying with some family.

Sunday morning, 3 Easter services to play and then headed directly to S.'s families' house again for Easter.  Her parents gave us a very generous Easter ""gift.""  I have already spent my portion on a new cooper Jo-Ral Harmon mute, a new chromatic tuner and speakers for my Imac at home.  A SUPER nice present.  Sarah is going to use her portion to start updating her office downstairs.  It was an early night for me...passed out asleep by 8pm.

Now?  I am at work until 11:30.  I plan to head to the thrift store after work to search for some dressy casual work pants or shirts.  Then, home to warm-up trumpet, then head to the gym to workout, then come back and trumpet more, then...there are about a bazillion things to accomplish and we'll see what I actually get to.

Good news!:::  I got a long-term sub position (1 year plus last 3 weeks of this school year) at a middle school.  It's a .3 position, but still, ROCK!  Very excited to get started in this way.  I will have another job at the same time along with teaching my own private students and gigging.  It'll be an awesome year."

Tues. I get to go to the doctor again...routine stuff thankfully.

Today I get to go to my parents house after work where it will be quiet so I can do a practice run through my exam.  Then, 3 hrs of trumpet.

Wed. is Sarah's 32nd Bday!  I am excited to give her her present.  Expecting to be wiped out that day after work from having had probably 4 hrs of sleep from Tues. night gig.

Thursday and Friday is studying and trumpeting.

Saturday is my test!! Whooohoo!  And Sunday is a rehearsal for Easter quartet with Connie, Jim and Andy.

This job is really fun.  I start @ 6am and get customers here and there... and I am allowed to eat or drink anything I want while I'm working...for free!  It's almost a given that I get to eat some kind of soup every day and have a mild expresso drink! :)

Some of you know we don't have a TV out of choice (it's like crack candy sometimes...too addicting!!) but we do watch TV series on my DVD/computer screen.  Right now, we are addicted to Joan (of Arcadia).  It's a SUPER show,...excellent cast and great writing.

Yesterday, I pushed myself too hard and found myself hurting substantially by the end of the day.  I drove my car for the first time in a couple of weeks and met Sarah at work for lunch.  Then, I drove to a Caribou to use my Gift Card and sit down with a Soy Chai and a Brass Pedagogy book from the library.  When I got up to leave the chair there I found I was in a LOT of pain....so I got to my car and drove home... took some drugs when I got home and starting applying for a couple of jobs online....then foolish me, attempted to play trumpet.... I have a rehearsal in a week and a long gig in 3 weeks and I haven't been able to play trumpet for nearly 2 weeks!!!!!!!!  Any serious tpt player knows how hard that is... to lose and build your chops back up.  I played carefully and gently as I could, but still, my wounds/abs had enough.  So, Sarah got home, we ate dinner (left-over tabouli, bread, hummus, and scrambled eggs).  I read my book (Xenocide-Orson Scott Card) while she did dishes and then we headed to bed with the movie.

Today??  Not sure just yet.  I slept in until 11:30am!!!!! I seriously haven't done that in years....probably college.  Want to go to the library maybe (only 2 miles away, if that) and try to play tpt again.... I'll be careful.  Tonight, I have my Zen Stress Reduction class for 2 1/2 hours.  I know they are going to be doing yoga, so I will get to watch from the sidelines.

Body healing is amazing... but it sure can be exhausting.

I am home.  As I told Sarah, I am feeling abnormally, normal.  I am tired, very sore and tender and a little out of it, but other than that, I feel great.  I can eat (cookie and graham cracker! yum) and drink with out getting sick *(so far).

It turns out it was NOT a cyst.  Scary enough, it was my falopian (spelling?) tube having had twisted on itself and having caused the tube itself to swell to the size of a baseball and fill with blood and stuff.  My doctor apparently told Sarah that she was not only surprised to find this, but suprised at my pain threshold (high).  It made me feel better to know that I am not wimpy and that this pain has been crazy intense and jutifiably so.

So there it is.  Going to continue to rest now.  :)  Thanks again for the support.

Just realized I didn't say what happened.  My Dr. took out my right falopian tube completely.  I still have a great uterus and one tube left so I can still get pregnant.  :)"

"event","""....if we are to be faithful to our happiness, we must paradoxically give up our concept of it.
     The concept of happiness is even more dangerous at the collective level (vs. individual).  Those who think they are working for the happiness of humanity contrive and perpetuate some of the most destructive idealogies.  Once you begin to believe you KNOW what is necessary for ""the happiness of humanity,"" you have taken the first step on the road to persecuting those who disagree.  The worst atrocities have been committed ""for the common good.""  If we wish to live in the freedom of full consciousness, we must rid ourselves of all dependence on this concept of happiness.  Those who have learned to look deeply, beyond idealogies, beyond concepts, and beyond all the pairs of opposites, never engage in aggression towards others-or towards themselves.""

"event","""Old carpeting, asserts Johnston, can be four times heavier than when it's installed.  That's how much dirt and dust accumulate when you lay a giant dust mop on your floor.  Moreover, conventional wall-to-wall can contain as many as 100 chemicals that are released over a three to five-year period.  Worse still, carpeting soaks up other nearby chemicals (arsenic from a pressure treated deck, formaldehyde from cheap cabinets, pesticide from the neighbor's lawn) and slowly re-releases them back into the air.  ""Conventional carpeting in a green home is an oxymoron,"" Johnston says.  Stick to area rugs that you can easily clean.""

I've never been happy to have mostly wood floors and rugs.  I do believe I will never move into a place with carpet again.
I am even more hyper aware of this because when I was a child, I got a disease called ""Kawasaki's disease"" which they think I could have gotten from carpet cleaner... chemical treatments....YUCK.

All consuming this time in multitudes of ways.  Someday, anyday, we will die.  It's amazing how alone we can feel in this vast world.  It's interesting to realize that most people don't give a flying fuck (and do something about it) about more than a couple of people in the world (including me admittedly right now).  
The people we serve.  The people who serve us.  They don't care about us... they care about their TV shows, or video games, or latest trends in some way... or they care about issues that make them feel/seem more important in this massive world... but all in all, nobody gives a shit... UNLESS, your turf effects the well-being (in either direction) of their ""world.""  THEN, and only then, YOU matter.  We try to escape facing our ""true"" selves every day.  We escape through jobs, food, media, sleep, family, kids...ANYthing.  We pick and choose what we want to believe or see as important... only truly seeing/receiving distorted perceptions based on our experiences.

I have a lot on my mind.  My perception tells me that it's okay that you might not care (again, unless it affects your life bubble).  I wish you all well, but...deep down... how much do I mean it??  And why?  

I enjoy things as they come and go, and I feel pain and sadness in things that come without warning (doesn't everything?!)...  I certainly can ""feel"" this life.  This one, small life, that can make something positive out of the world that is part of my own, yet declares it is outside of me."

His wife won't let him advertise because he already gets so much business by word of mouth.  Anyway, when I came to pick my car up (which I scooted a mile on my razor scooter after falling off and jolting/scraping my body this morning), the mechanic had misplaced/lost my key.  One of the mechanics drove me home and I found my spare.  The mechanic didn't make me pay today...and said he would call me when he found my key.  All I had done was a coolant flush/fill.  

Had a meeting this morning with the head of the Camden Music School ( http://www.camdenmusicschool.org ) to discuss and plan my part in an effort to recruit and make the music school known to the many Camden neighborhood and NE side schools.  I will be working for a 4 week stint and visiting schools/teachers/presenting our school to the local community at hand.  A LOT of networking in store.  I am nervous and excited.  I know this rips a new hole when it comes to freeing up my time (hahhaha), but it is for the right reason... it is taking a step toward the direction I feel I want to be... 

Also went to the library and picked up my books and cassette (PDQ Bach) and a couple of audio books (YA).  Went to the Co-Op for food and stuff too.
OH, OH, OH!!!  I've switched sections at my bookstore.  I no longer have Religion/Philosolphy and Metaphysics... I now run the Kids and Young Adult section, in addition to helping run the Nostalgia/Collectible section still.  This section (Kids) is known to be very tricky and crazy in many ways.  I'm excited to kick its booty and have some fun...  I love this literature...thanks to Sarah who really turned me on to it.

Today yet, I had planned to trumpet and to start sanding the loft bed wood in the garage... but my body is yelling at me for falling down earlier.

2 days before Thanksgiving, I think I'm making a trip to Madison to spend some time alone and with my friends Dani and Lori.

To be in an environment with such fine food and drink... and to realize it was such a treat (my friend took us there because he just closed the biggest sales deal for his company ever...over 3 million bucks)... made me happy and sad.  Happy because I could appreciate it so much.  Sad because I am looking for new employment in which I have may change gears...but have no idea yet just how... because I make $8.50hr right now (plus my gig side money)...

the world around me right now?  

my valve on my trumpet is getting worse.  i need a new horn... and want to step it up since i spend more time gigging and making money doing the thing... i've finally earned it.  which means, i need to sell my C and maybe even my piccolo trumpet... want to spend 3-3500 on a new Bb.

turned down a job today to teach 1.5 hrs a week at a VERY urban school with no classroom, little to no supplies, and volume control issues *HelllllOOOOO, it's called MUSIC class people!*... so, NOT ideal for my first teaching experience whatsoever.  I understand there is never a perfect place or situation, but the cons outweighed the pros tenfold.

i DID get hired to teach at the Camden Music School on the North and NE side of MPLS.  Gigging has also increased.  My goal is to find another job by the Holiday Season and slowly work towards making all of my money from music...and teaching music.

the neighbor kids next door are driving me nuts.  they yell and yell and scream and cry all day... and torment my need for quiet, and the chickens' needs for solitude and grazing peacefully.  speaking of chickens, one of our buffs have started laying eggs!!!!  YAY!!!  patiently waiting for the other 3 to start.  the kids need to go back to school.  summer is toooo long for kids....if they are not stimulated.

found a nice place over a creek to meditate that is a couple of miles away.  thinking i might see if sarah is up to the bike ride tonight.

uncle's cancer has come back.  will start treatment soon.  dad is hanging in there but is bothered.

had a vet appointment for fidget today.  she is healthy.  she has a problem throwing up her food, so i'm trying some things out... we'll see.  other than that, she is lookin' good! yay fidget!

money.  i have none!! ha.  no really, i need/want to save for things like a music notation program and equipment (1,000 bucks), new trumpet 3K, Acoustic gtr (couple hundred), a new harmon mute (70 bucks), a treadmill (??).... not possible while makin' $8hr.  this is a transition time though, ...i knew it going in, and i know it now.  

chicago... i am missing it HARD core man.  missing the vibe and pulse of the city... the ability to blend in and stand out... they endless possibilities and nooks and crannies to explore.  The Twin Cities is cool.... just more spread out... and not as easy to blend in.  Missing the public transit time a lot too.... my chance to relax and read and take in my surroundings... THAT was my daily meditation.  What does this mean?? I don't know... 

going to be helping to teach band camp in hudson in a couple of weeks.  very exicted about that.  had to use all of my vacation time from work to do this,but worthwhile... and profitable...

On the icky side, more student loans kicked in this week... which brings me to $420 a month in loan payments.  Barely making ends meet right now folks.  Decided to cut way back on eating out budget and also restricting my budget to buy stuff from work.

-Went to a ""party"" with good Indian food that was a friend of my mom's...and sort of a new acquaintance of mine... he is my mom's old principal at work.  I felt extremely wallflowery yesterday.  S. helped save me and took the extrovert reigns that were needed to survive the evening.

-Next weekend we will have 4 chicks in our basement (the yellow furry kind folks!).

Okay, I stink...shower time."

"event","It is morning.  S. just went to work.  Aside from trumpet practicing and reading, I have no plans.  We are supposed to get dumped on with more snow today.  So, add shoveling to that list.  But until S. gets home around 6ish, not much to do.  
I want to do SOMETHING.  What shall I do?  I want to do something with a person/people.  I've spent plenty of time alone~  as much as I like that, it's time for socializing...
Anybody wanna come hang out??? heehee"

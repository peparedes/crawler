"event","had more work done on my root canal today. trip number 2. have to go to my regular dentist in 2 weeks to get a permanent filling done. just have a temp one now. i've never had to go this many times. yuck. not feeling too bad now. had to go home and take a nap earlier. got to work late. but i got a yummy chocolate shake from sonic. my stomach feels kinda blah from all of it. i cant stand the smells. when they were doing the filling it smelled like nail polish remover. and then she took an xray, they took off part of the stuff that was in my mouth but i was gagging on the xray stuff so she had to stay and hold it in place. i tried to point out that i didnt have the xray sheild thing on but did not have success. oh well, it was aimed at my mouth and its only a tiny bit of radiation. but still. it worries me. probably for no reason.

now im at work and its boring. 

gross rainy day. 

had a nice nap earlier and ate some pasta for lunch. now i just have to get through 3.5 more hours of work and storytime."

you can get dish without a contract if you pay the $99 set up fee.they have some good packages too but i know nothing about the service and do not know anyone who has them.
from what i can tell direct is pretty similar to comcast in price and you need a box for each tv to get anything.

i wish there were more companies.


if anyone knows a good local internet company in nashville i would love to know about it too."

i applied for another job with the library. really hope i get it. its ok here, but i'm getting burnt out. i need some time off. we are hoping to take a trip to canada in march for our anniversary. it will be great to get a week off! still dont know when i am off for thanksgiving and christmas. emailed the manager about it yesterday. jason has to ask off for the rest of the year soon. he cant carry any time over. and thanksgiving is next month, so i need to start making plans. i cant stand how disorganized this place is sometimes.

good thing i went in and got it done. the tooth was infected. they removed all the gross stuff and put medicine in it. i go back in 2 weeks and they take out the medicine and fill it. i had 1 root that my previous dentist completely missed.

i think if i ever need another one im going to go straight to the endodontist. 


oh. went to talk to my ob/gyn today about issues with the shot. she pretty just said no that shouldnt be from the shot..so i guess its just a coincidence that it started at the same time...she also said i seem a little depressed (um i had a root canal today and last time i was on my period) suggested i see a therapist. she thinks i have pmdd and it might help to talk to someone. we'll see. it might, but im not very comfortable with that idea.

i think i would love to try to get certified to teach yoga. maybe next year. then when we have kids i can just try to teach a few classes a week to stay in shape and make a little money. but its around 3,000 to get certified and most classes are on weekends, which i cant do now since i work. but that gives me time to practice more and work harder. i like gentle yoga, thats what i would like to teach but i should try other forms and push myself more so i wont feel so behind we i go to take the classes. i am not very flexible even though i've taken yoga for a while."

the people here seem ok, but this building has way too many problems since it is only 9 years old. it has dust, which all libraries do, but i think it has mold too. its killing my allergies. and water gets in when it rains so they have to put fans on the carpet to dry it. im trying to make the most of it, but i want to go back to green hills.
they have been very short staffed here. i got keys and alarm code my 1st day. so its not as busy but i have more responsibility here. had to do the money by myself sun. that was only the 4th time i had done it. it takes a while to learn. i've had to open and close the building. its been crazy. my boss is off this week. she is moving. 
this buidling is a mess! i've been working on the childrens desk. got it fixed up nice. threw away a ton of stuff. going to start on the file cabinet next. then the workroom and closet. those could take a long time. 
have storytime tonight if anyone shows up.


my grandmother is doing chemo. she is hanging in there. its hard. 

peanut is taking an advanced class at petsmart, doing well. he was sick this morning. and he found a dead mouse in the backyard. we were puppy sitting for a while veruca's parents went out of town. she is so cute,but a little handful. been watching true blood at their house. yay for friends with hbo.

he is trying to sell it to carmax now. if we can get $200 for it and be done that would be awesome. the plan is to try to get rid of his car today. organize the garage so we can park both cars in there (which is gonna suck cuz the heat index is 110 today. bleh.) then go buy the nissan cube tmw. assuming they can make the numbers work for us. 

i went to dinner with a lady from my yoga class thurs night. it was fun. went to a place near my work called kalatas. very yummy. then walked around pier 1 and got hot chocolate from starbucks. it was nice to have a girls night and have someone to hang out with. makes it easier when jason is gone.

"event","bleh. i want to be over this gunk already. my throat hasnt been this sore in forever. and i was getting better. 2 weeks is long enough to be sick. 

went to the doc, strep test came back negative. he took another swab and is sending it for testing to see what is going on. gave me a z-pack. so im gonna go pick that up and hope i can tolerate it. then going to panera to get soup for dinner. i've had 2 popsicles today. my throat wants cold. but i need more than that. 

bleh. im whiny when im sick. its good and bad that jason isnt here this week.

i stayed home from work today. took a 4 hour nap then walked the dog. its so nice outside. not gross and rainy like it was this morning. 

yay new castle tonight. im not sure i'll be awake for it. last time i took a z-pack it literally knocked me out half an hour later. hah so he said to take it at bedtime. but i need to take it after i eat so it doenst kill my stomach, so i'll do that after dinner."

"event","my little boy graduated from his intermediate class today. he passed his test. it was so cute.<br /><p>i'll post a pic later.</p><p><br />we signed him up for tricks and advanced class. at the end of the advanced class he gets to take the canine good citizenship test.&nbsp; we got a great deal. not many people are signing up for classes now. its $109 a class and $79 for a private class. we got to sign him up for both classed for the price of 1 private class! and his tricks class will be private again just like his intermediate class. we will scheduled advanced for a time when other dogs will be there. so we will be busy for&nbsp; a few more months. we are doing tricks every other weekend when i'm off.<br /><br />anyway, i'm a proud momma right now :) <br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","haha when jason and i in bed last night we were deciding what to watch. he usually puts it on csi miami. i was not in the mood so i picked a movie on demand (a free movie) hah loverboy! the 80s movie with a young little patrick dempsey. jason had not seen this before so we watched about an hour of it before going to sleep. 
oh the 80s. patrick dempsey got sexier as he got older!"

"event","grr i was able to breathe enough to sleep last night. yay. i stayed in bed for like 12 hours. but im still tired and my throat hurts. my temp is 99.7, not too bad. i'm gonna check it again in a couple of hours and it goes up i'll take something. bleh i just cant stand the idea of swallowing pills right now. 

i also want a bagel even though it would probably be scracthy. but i dont feel like going to the store to get one. sad. walgreens is like 5 min away. they might have it and i need to go there anyway, but i dont wanna. 

at least its my weekend off. what a great way to spend it...i need to clean house.

oh well. 


hmm i think i have some liquid cold stuff. i could try taking that, but it will probably make me itch. most medicine does..."

"event","i'm tired of being sick with this cold/allergies or whatever. i think its getting better. i would feel a lot better if i could sleep, but my nose does not want to cooperate.

oh well, i have a 3 day weekend to rest. 

i should be well enough to do stuff by sat or sun if anyone wants to hang out..maybe go to a movie or get food. 

oh. soup at jason's deli...not good..i wanted soup and was disappointed when i got a sandwich instead because their soup was gross. so i hate like half of it and came home and had cheerios. panera is the best place to get soup (on mon-wed-fri for me) or bread and company. oh well, now i know."

"event","so it looks like we might be able to stay at a nice hotel in cleveland, just outside chattanooga for free with jason's points. yay. its only half an hour from downtown and he has stayed there before.

we are getting our taxes redone..same place. got a correction in the mail about or mortgage. might have us owing a little less. yay.


jason went to the dentist. his tooth needs to be retreated but his insurance only pays 1000 a year. so no matter what its going to cost at least 500. maybe closer to 600 or 700 and thats assuming he doenst need a new crown. bleh. but they will take monthly payments, so we could spread it out over 6 months interest free. we are thinking about it. it needs to be done but its so expensive! i need to go back and have my tooth looked at too, my insurance is better but i dont think my office takes payment plans so it would have to go on a credit card. and its already been retreated so im wondering if anything can be done for it.

anyway i should get back to work. im hungry. not lunch time yet though.

we are going to watch tropic thunder tonight if anyone wants to come over and hang out."

"event","just got back from Nut's class. he is tired now! he was a good boy, he is working so hard to do his tricks. he is still a crazy hyper ball of energy though.


i dont feel so great today. my allergies are acting up and my stomach is blah.


nuts trainer said we should bring him in once a month and let them bathe him, they can get rid of a lot more hair and dander. he said to have jason brush him 3 times a week using a zoom groom thing and wipe him with cucumber melon baby wipes. that will make him smell nice. bathing him too often produces more dander so this should be better for my allergies. we'll see. 

ok, im gonna go take a bath and maybe eat some lunch."

we are getting our taxes done sat so hopefully we will get a refund!


oh. the doc office called. they said that i have anti-thyroid antibodies, but no auto immune or thyroid problem. didnt seem too concerned and didnt tell me to come back. so i guess i should keep an eye on it because it could lead to thyroid problems later...at least thats what im getting from what little i could find online. they did say that there are medications to help with thyroid problems that are safe to take during pregnancy. so that might be good to know in a couple of years. i want to be prepared when we have kids...as much as possible anyway."

"event","nurse called today with my lab results. good and bad.
good-it doenst look like there is any auto immune disorder
bad-i tested positive for that because I have some thyroid problem.
so i have to go back in the next couple of weeks and let them poke me to run some more tests.
then hopefully they can treat it and make me better. 


its so weird. im the only person under 70 when i go there. im too young for all of this. 

oh and my car is rattling again..back to nissan it goes. probably next weekend and while its there we can take jasons car and go get our taxes done. ::crosses fingers for a refund:: i think it will be ok this year! buying a house is good."

"event","ive been up and exercising every day.
been doing my knee exercises for about 15 min each morning then walking nut for 20-30 min. it wears us both out. we run for a little of the time. i get winded fast. sad. i am not a runner. its hard when you are carrying a bunch of dog stuff with you too. 

jason went to the dentist and got his teeth cleaned. no cavities, but his wisdom tooth has been hurting and is infected again. he really needs to go get it fixed this time. he had a root canal on it a few years ago and has always had issues with the crown. my tooth is still hurting too. i need to go back. bleh but its expensive. i guess i should do that while i still have a job and insurance. things arent looking good at work."

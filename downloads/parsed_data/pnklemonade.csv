"event","How do you have nights like this and then things still don't work out the way they should? How can you stare into someones eyes for hours and talk about your entire life, and it just ends like that, like hours of conversation meant nothing. How can a simple caress of the leg make you warm inside? How can someone be soo perfect yet so wrong? How can you be so much like someone but still not have the answers? How can you rest your head in someones lap and not have there be more? How come you can spend endless hours with people who don't even know you and have a time limit with me? How do you not know why you are so hurt? How come you feel that even i will hurt you? How does everyone around us see the ""us"" but you can't bare the thought in your mind? How can you not tell how much i care? How can you have a night with me like this one and still leave me?"

"event","For almost 1 year i have been thinking of only you... well to say only you it would be a small exaggeration... but mostly you would make more sense.  For the past five years YOU were my bestest friend... and i have known you for five years on top of that.  There are no contradictions in anyones minds that you know me... you know what makes me mad, what makes me laugh, and especially what hurts me to the point of tears.  I would rather someone be honest with me and feel the pain immediately then for somone to be dishonest with me, no matter how much it hurts.  The idea of anyone sleeping there would drive me crazy and get me upset, especially so close to the end; but the idea that my best friend is the one sleeping there, hurts more than words could explain.  I wish i could get over things quickly, but this time i can't.  i am not going to drop this one... cause looking at it from every angle it was WRONG.  The fact that you don't understand it was wrong makes it that much worse... The sorry was a help towards the right/ the better... but time is the only thing that will heal this wound.  I thought after going to sleep i would feel better... i would wake up and feel relieved but the pain only worsened.  I know it will go away but i wonder how long it will take.  It is an unbearable pain... no other thoughts can occupy my mind.  I want to hate you right now... i can't, but i want too.  I hope that somehow you will end up seeing how hurt i am, and how wrong what you did was, but until then all i can ask is that somehow i can believe you again, trust you again, and even somehow feel that you love me again.  Since at this moment i feel as though you care about no one other than yourself."

I don't understand what it is about you that i just want to know EVERYTHING about you. When you speak i'm intrigued by the words you have to say.   Shawns the only one before that i could say that about.  Your family, your life, your interests, your hobbies... everysingle topic i wanted to hear every detail of... and a lot of the time it seemed as though you wanted to hear all about mine too.  It was so comfortable just talking and the way you could open up to me surprised me.  You have always seemed so shy, so i question to myself if you opened up cause it was me... or have i just perceived the person you are to be different... either way it made me happy.  Then saturday night came... and to put it lightly, you treated me in a way that i no longer felt special.  It's strange how your actions towards me can change so quickly. however you did say you were extremely tired... i have to keep telling myself that because i just get upset when i don't."

"event","I just got home from seeing the notebook, and it was pretty amazing.  It does make you contemplate life and love though in new ways.  I know that in my heart i have loved before, and all i can do is hope that i will be able to love again.  When people come in my path, i will often times place walls around myself, cause the pain of lost love is worse than the pain of seeking for love.  I know that these feelings aren't love, but part of me wishes they could be love.  It's this complicated knot deep in my stomach that has occupied my mind for the last few days.  I want the story book... but the other night was a bit of a disappointment.  It's almost as if there are two people i know...  and it's the one at work that i fell in like with, the other one was different... the mystery was gone.  It was almost the epitome of what i am so not attracted to.  But;  then he looks at me, and I feel something.  It sounds so silly... but it truely is the way he looks at me that makes me think about him until i see him again.  When i speak to him, he blocks out everyone else around him... it feels like where in our own world while he hangs on everyword i have to say.  I hate it though... i hate when he talks to me about himself and all i want to do is hear more.  I want to hear about everyday of his life... I hate that this whole situation is taking so long  I guess patience truely is a virtue and i waited this long for the phone call and i guess i can just sit and wait for the next step to take place.... but it will drive me crazy......."

"event","Don't be fooled by me.
               Don't be fooled by the face I wear
               for I wear a mask, a thousand masks,
               masks that I'm afraid to take off,
               and none of them is me.

               Pretending is an art that's second nature with me,
               but don't be fooled,
               for God's sake don't be fooled.
               I give you the impression that I'm secure,
               that all is sunny and unruffled with me, within as well
                    as without,
               that confidence is my name and coolness my game,
               that the water's calm and I'm in command
               and that I need no one,
               but don't believe me.
               My surface may seem smooth but my surface is my mask,
               ever-varying and ever-concealing.
               Beneath lies no complacence.
               Beneath lies confusion, and fear, and aloneness.
               But I hide this.  I don't want anybody to know it.
               I panic at the thought of my weakness exposed.
               That's why I frantically create a mask to hide behind,
               a nonchalant sophisticated facade,
               to help me pretend,
               to shield me from the glance that knows.

               But such a glance is precisely my salvation, my only hope,
               and I know it.
               That is, if it's followed by acceptance,
               if it's followed by love.
               It's the only thing that can liberate me from myself,
               from my own self-built prison walls,
               from the barriers I so painstakingly erect.
               It's the only thing that will assure me
               of what I can't assure myself,
               that I'm really worth something.
               But I don't tell you this.  I don't dare to, I'm afraid to.
               I'm afraid your glance will not be followed by acceptance,
               will not be followed by love.
               I'm afraid you'll think less of me,
               that you'll laugh, and your laugh would kill me.
               I'm afraid that deep-down I'm nothing
               and that you will see this and reject me.

               So I play my game, my desperate pretending game,
               with a facade of assurance without
               and a trembling child within.
               So begins the glittering but empty parade of masks,
               and my life becomes a front.
               I tell you everything that's really nothing,
               and nothing of what's everything,
               of what's crying within me.
               So when I'm going through my routine
               do not be fooled by what I'm saying.
               Please listen carefully and try to hear what I'm not saying,
               what I'd like to be able to say,
               what for survival I need to say,
               but what I can't say.

               I don't like hiding.
               I don't like playing superficial phony games.
               I want to stop playing them.
               I want to be genuine and spontaneous and me
               but you've got to help me.
               You've got to hold out your hand
               even when that's the last thing I seem to want.
               Only you can wipe away from my eyes
               the blank stare of the breathing dead.
               Only you can call me into aliveness.
               Each time you're kind, and gentle, and encouraging,
               each time you try to understand because you really care,
               my heart begins to grow wings--
               very small wings,
               very feeble wings,
               but wings!

               With your power to touch me into feeling
               you can breathe life into me.
               I want you to know that.
               I want you to know how important you are to me,
               how you can be a creator--an honest-to-God creator--
               of the person that is me
               if you choose to.
               You alone can break down the wall behind which I tremble,
               you alone can remove my mask,
               you alone can release me from my shadow-world of panic,
               from my lonely prison,
               if you choose to.
               Please choose to.

               Do not pass me by.
               It will not be easy for you.
               A long conviction of worthlessness builds strong walls.
               The nearer you approach to me
               the blinder I may strike back.
               It's irrational, but despite what the books say about man
               often I am irrational.
               I fight against the very thing I cry out for.
               But I am told that love is stronger than strong walls
               and in this lies my hope.
               Please try to beat down those walls
               with firm hands but with gentle hands
               for a child is very sensitive.

               Who am I, you may wonder?
               I am someone you know very well.
               For I am every man you meet
               and I am every woman you meet."

Well, let me tell you that's exactly what I wanted to hear right before bedtime.  Why during your drunken escapade did you have to call me?!  

I dont remember what I have done the last few days.  Thursday night i got soo messed up that i didn't even know what i was doing with myself... that's why on friday i decided i was done being party girl!  It's only been two days but i'm doing good so far ha.  I'm going back to drinking every once in awhile and never ever smoking again.  It's pointless and i'm smart enough to know that i just was getting wrapped up in stupid shit for some reason.  But, i'm back on track now!  

Tonight i played bartender... i know what you're thinking... No more drinking, but i didn't!!!  I just influenced everyone else to drink, and i just had two beers, just cause... not to get drunk or anythign, they just tasted good :)

Okay well, i'm going to go and try and fall asleep.  Between the dumb drunken phone calls, the frustrations of the night, and the stupid boy on vacation, i know i'll fall asleep quite fast... lol, oh how i wish!"

Then I went home and decided not to go to Saddleback/peak...So, instead i just went to FRidays.  I wasn't planning to drink or anything but somehow i ended up getting bombed...but it's okay cause ""beer isn't alcohol!""  Awww!  And Wess Is the BEST!!! except i think i made my turkeybutt mad or something cause he was in a good mood then all of a sudden he's not in a good mood anymore, and i can't help to think it has something to do with me.  Oh and i guess Rob hugged me and i was suppose to get happy but i didn't even know.  That made life a little depressing.  Then there was the millions of hugs, and dentist appointments... Which i still don't understand... and flexing muscles... ice cream shoes... ""She's my good friends girlfriend""... Frolicking.. Talking like a valley girl... Tiff being my shadow.. The horrible music... getting 4385729 extra beers somehow etc etc etc  I got yelled at for using my word PRECIOUS , Cause all of a sudden it's tiff's word, even though it's mine.   Aww... Fiji Water in the back parking lot.  Rob thought i was drinking Tequilia, but it was just soCO.  I bet he thinks i like him, which sucks!!!!  Just cause i copy his stupid water bottle which he stole from someone else.  Jeese!  Oh, then we went to Wess' Home and did chinese fire drill and my friends thought i was going to drive and yea i dont' remember what else... Some Del Taco and Walking and yea.... Then holy hangovers batmans this morning.  

Every Goodnight has to have a horrible morning though and that's just what mine was.... From paint cans flying at my car to the closet breaking... to my broken bed to driving all the way to newbury park to see a sad friend to wait.. that was it that was bad now i'm sitting at tiff's waiting for her to get ready.  We're going to see a sneak preview woohoooo fun!"

"event","It is amazing how me of all people could actually let myself care about someone.  I never let myself care for anyone, because I am so terrified of getting hurt again like always.  It is a lot easier to just keep my walls up,only think boys are cute, and never actually think about them.  I do not even understand how I care about him.  I dont even know him (even though i really do)  It's just that he was so precious... is so precious.  Normally i would laugh at someone if they cared for someone like i care for him... but all i can say is there is something about him.  No one has ever given me their undivided attention the way he does.  When we talk, no one else even exists.  It's like we're in our own world.  There's this chemistry I feel with him, that can only be compared to my shawn.  He makes me so happy, even though he is confusing. There have been other boys in the past, but he's the first one that i really want to work.   I find myself constantly thinking about him.  It's more than a crush.  I think its because he reminds me sooo much of shawn.  Oh, it's fun he gives me butterflies in my stomach!  I actually get excited to see him.  I forgot what that was like, since the last person that happened with was Bryan.  I guess if things are suppose to work out they will, and i need to be patient."

Tiff read about erotica dreams, which rob has allthe time, or they're just the ones he remembers.  My boyfriend was on television and B laughed at me.  It was a pointless night, but fun!  

Oh, we dropped Mike off and then went back to Thousand Oaks and visited Amber.  She's way the best and sooooo sweet and funny.  

The fog was extremely bad again tonight.  I do not like driving home in it!  I feel like i can not see the front of the car even."

and I just don't know.  I'm really wanting a boyfriend for the first time ever, even though if I had one i would complain and complain that i didn't want one.  But i'm just going to go to sleep now, cause i can't let my brain think about him or anything else anymore"

I'm such a dork, Wednesday is snowboarding day, and i actually think about him throughout the day, like about how i hope he's driving safe and stuff, oh and that he's not getting lost like all these other snowboarders... scary scary!

Anyways, I'm just going to try really hard and not care anymore... I never should have in the first place....

He's a dumb ass cause he hasn't called yet. oh wells, mommy will be gone for aweek and then maybe i'll just have to invite him over, lol and then eat tiff's asshole!  Stephanie is soooo much fun.  I had fun with her this afternoon.  Oh, i went to dmv today and it took 2 hours talk about misery.  But my rachel and tiff are the best and kept me entertained.  

So, about the boy.  I really do not understand him.  Does he really need to act like he wants me soooooo bad and then not call.  I really want to hang out with him blah!!!!"

Then I came to Tiffany's House and she had to have a respondsibility talk with her mother while I just sat there waiting and waiting and waiting.  Then her mom decided that i should be tiff's tutor, which i don't really wanna do cause she won't obey me and i'm scared it will make us fight.  Right now i'm annoyed at kyle.  Hes a really selfish person and it's starting to get old.  He doesn't appreciate anyone!!!!!  I still don't think of him as tiff's boyfriend and i should.  I feel bad that i look at him that way cause of tiff.  Well anyways, we went to TARGET for ten hundred years and sat on the lawn furnature and it was fun... and we bought pilates and south beach diet book.... Then we came home and did pilates... ouch!!! but it was fun.  Now i'm just sitting here waiting for the inferno to start cause i'm mtv obcessed. Tiff's on the phone with kyle and yea... mike made fun of him and she kicked mike out great huh?!  k i'm done with this i'm not in the mood to type i'm gonna go bother her now."

"event","So, it's been an interesting weekend.  Thursday night we borrowed robs piece and yea.... then friday night i went to this way fun place called howl at the moon but the whole time i wanted to be at fridays... imagine that i'm such a loser.  so finally i decide to go there cause tiff didn't stop telling me how bad he wanted to see me and stuff so i get there and he was sooo cute and he got his hair cute and his face gone and stuff but i was standing by the bathroom on the phone with kristen cause i left her in hollywood and yea.... i was kind of ignoring him i guess cause when we walked away rachel said he was asking me ten hundred questions and i just wasn't listening.... So, then i talked to him for awhile and stuff and it was fun i guess..... then i made the horrible horrible mistake of showing tiff who eric was.... well she didn't stop harassing him for the rest of the night... she even called fridays and asked to talk to him and stuff then the dumbass that he is gives her his cell number... who does that. well i bet he regreted that later on cause she left him a zillion and six messages .... she even left him one pretending that she thought it was russ's  voicemail just so eric would know everything about our night, or something like that.  she didn't really make much sense.  She left everyone messages that night that made no sense.  Then Saturday i spent the day with stephanie and we went to the mall and bent and aunties and then to family sushi dinner... then we went walking later on that night and that was hilarious with tiff and amber..... and yea u turns and people laying in the street and yes it was way hilarious even though i was like on the verge or tears when it was going on.  then we went to del taco with all hobson's random friends... then today i woke up at 1 which is almost unheard of for me... i drove tori home for auntie and then tiff and i just hung out at target and fridays and rachels utnil now.,,, we were only going to go there for a short time but we stayed forever cause we reminsised about everythign.... cartoons, fridays nights, sex, new years, everything.... most random conversations ever   it was way fujn though.... thanks girls .... oh and tiff read our horoscopes and they were all talking about him which was fun.... now i just want him to be my boyfriend cause i lub him hahahhahah"

  Tomorrow i get to go shopping with mom woohooo... atleast tomorrow will be more eventful than this day.  I woke up at like 8 and got homework done, then i basically sat online the rest of the day.  It's raining out which makes it a little more exciting and acceptable.

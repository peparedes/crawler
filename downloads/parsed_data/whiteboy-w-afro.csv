And so my summer ends.
It's been fun.

I'll miss every single day of this wonderful summer.  And every person I hung out with... Thank you for putting up with me!  This'll be my last post for a while, unless I hate my job so much I feel the need to bitch.

Expect the slow back to forward deletion of this journal starting over the next few days.  I'm eventually going to revamp it and make a dashing come-back to the blog scene.  But, for now.

Auf wiedersehen!"

"event","The only way to describe how I feel right now would be a long pointless rambling similar to 2 posts down, with a very liberal use of varied and sparatic meter which brings shame to the poetic and lyrical fields.  So, I'll let someone else's lyrics describe it for me:

Alexisonfire - It was Fear of Myself that Made Me Odd

Spinning Arms spread crushing the tops of moutians/with my hands
As I dive into the pacific I flood the shorelines
I exhale causing the oceans endless waves
I emerge shaking the wreckage from my hair/with my hands
(I want to breath life into the Dead Sea)
As this rain forest fall beneath my knees
I want to breath life into the dead sea
I will play until the sky is black, breath in all the air, exhale and choke
The land with carbon, from where I stand I can see the curvature of the earth/and I want to make it flat.
I will play until the sky is black.


If you get a chance and you're not opposed to hardcore punk, pick up either Alexisonfire album, or both.  They're one of the biggest influences on my life these days.
I'm kind of in a bad mood, I should probablly do something important, or maybe make us of my life or something.
That'd be smart.
Something needs to go my way sometime soon.  Or I need to go to a show and forget my problems.  Either one works equally as well.  So no worries.

I'll post later, I need to relax, really bad."

I'm really not in the mood to update all the stuff that's happened.  There are a few things of importance though.

1)  I learned to play poker, and we played a 6 hour game.
2)  I have no game; girls my age aren't interested in me
3)  Brad N. is coming down with the horrible MMO disease
4)  Mike S. and I have it already, but we know how to deal.
5)  I am nearly broke, and summer has just begun
6)  Internet radio isn't a waste of time

Sugarcult concert today.  I'm spending the night at Matt's house, should be swanky.  Can't wait.
Coming home tommorow before noon, and going to the beach.

But I can try my hardest, and work to the fullest to be the best possible person I can be, if it means you'll care for me, like I wish you would, but if not that's okay, because just knowing you makes me feel 10 times more happy than I did when we were only sort-of friends.  All I can say now is that I'm here and I'm waiting, for when you feel like smiling I'll be set with my camera to capture perfection on a small peice of paper, for all of those people who wont get to see it, I'll spread the word and then they will feel it.  The energy and hapiness that you could spread, if you just took your heals from over your head.  Always keep fighting and never give up, because you could make miracles if you wanted.  But, that's just my luck.  I can't compare to anything you can do, so why did I ever think I had a shot with you?

Today was just effing peachy.  Note the sarcasm.  I stayed up wayyyy to late last night, like whoa.  I slept like an hour total over the course of school today.  Took my Africa Test in Global Studies.  Didn't do tooo bad, but I complained to Mrs. Arruda for like 10 mintues before hand.  Haha.  I even resorted to the dreaded ""If I can't see you, you can't see me!""  Good times.

Piggy back race after lunch.  Katie and I lost to Val and Brad.  Haha.  I'll get you next time, you hooligans.

I'm really getting into Angels & Demons by Dan Brown.  Prequel to The Da Vinci Code.  This author is seriously one smart cookie.  His puzzles are astounding.  I'm seriously at a loss to determine what is fiction, and what is fact.

5 days left of my Sophomore year of High School.  Wonderfull.  I'm so fucking excited.  Again with the sarcasm.  This summer is going to blow so hard.  Oh well.

Physical for my Permit yesterday... Tetnis shot... Mein Arm tut mir sehr weh!  =(  Other than that it wasn't too bad.  Apparently I have inherently stuffy nose syndrome.  Haha.  The doctor asked ""Is your nose always stuff"" I said ""Yup."" he said ""Hm.  That's no good."" and I was slightly confused but let it slide.

My nose hurts from the Chlorine in the pool A prd.

I need to do my homework tonight.

5 days left of school... Guh...

Today:  Powwow with Val, Caresse, and Sarah.
Verdict:  Absolutely amazing.

Sooo much fun.  We were all punchy and like laughing at the dumbest things as we tried to get this stupid project done.  Our projects were finished an hour ago, and they look exactly the same except reveresed.  Haha.  It's awesome.

I seriously had a really good time though, I definetly want to do it again, but without a project next time because that just made it so much less fun come 6:30 and we still had like nothing done.

Really good day though.  Sarah-Val-Caresse overload to the max.  We hung out like all day.  It was awesome.  =)

Brad and I sat in the seats in front of them next to the wall.  The movie was SO bad, but it was absolutely hilarious.

Saturday:  Woke up and worked at my parents garage sale until like 12ish.  I played a game for like a hour or two and then I invited Tristan over to spend the night.  Dave invited himself over like 20 minutes later.  So Tristan, Dave, and I went into Yardley and got a frappachino because we're hipsters like that.  (That was sarcastic)  Then we went to Dave's place to check out his new Bose Penis Amp which is unbelieveable.  It's like a work of technical art.  So, Dave and I jammed out (*Cough*) for an hour or three.  Then we all came back to my house, where we continued our jam session, but I couldn't right anything on the acoustic last night.  Tristan and I played some video games.  Then we watched Dogma untill we fell asleep.  Dogma's such a good movie. 

Sunday:  Woke up to a Egg, Bacon, and Bagel breakfast courtesy of my dad.  We ate outside, it was nice.  Then Dave had to leave for his guitar lessons.  His instructer didn't show.  Tristan and I played some games for an hour or two before he decided to go home.  Then I came home and washed my car.  (Yes, my car.  =P)  Dave called while I was doing that and invited me over to Audition for his new band project.  I rode my bike to starbucks.  We got another Frap. because we're uber-cool.  Then walked to Dave's house where we started writing a song.  I wrote lyrics to the intro, but the musically more aggresive part is hard to write for, but I'll get it just fine.  I stoped the pussy stage fright crap and stoped singing all nasely.  We cooked up the lyrics and then ate dinner.  After that we set up the set we're going to cover at this gig at a bowling alley either in June or July, I forget.  Not too much time to prep, but Dave's confident.  Then I came home and started writing this.

This weeked was absolutely amazing.  I had such a wonderful time, and I am indeed pysched.

"event","Eh, lots of stuff has been going on recently.  My head kind of hurts a little bit from everything.  I feel like alot of stuff is closing in on me.  But, I'll get through it.  It'll just take a while.

Dude, I totally have like a non-sexual chrush on my entire D-Prd. class.  It's abso-fucking-lutely amazing.  I look forward to that class so much.  Haha.  My day isn't complete until Mrs. Aruda looks at me like I'm on crack, Sarah; Val; and Careese attend to my mental health and put up with my mindless banter, Kyle M. says something so profoundly obnoxious it makes my spine tingle, Max Ashcraft puts a generally okay question into terms so indisputeably layman's that it sets off a twang in the back of my brain, or until one of the hip Alex's remark about a particular shirt I am wearing.  Haha.  That class rocks, completely and totally.  If it weren't for the fact that Global studies was such an annoying subject I would totally not come into school until D prd.  I wouldn't be able to handle the anticipation.  Haha.  If that class was a language class I would flat out die.  Par Excellance my friends, that is the only way to put it.

Mr. Majikas is the man... but definetly needs to work on explaining stuff a little bit better.

So, Rachel's been asking me a slew of completely random questions that seem to be leading to something.  They all stemed from a conversation concering her preperations for my birthday which as you should ALL know falls on June 17th, second day of Finals for PHS'ers.  My guess is she's planning something and is going to try her hardest not to tell me.  I could pretty easily weasel it out of her, but I'd rather let her have her fun.  =)  She's so sweet though.  I think it's adorable that she's setting something up like this.  I still don't know what it is exactly, but I have a few suspicious guesses.  She's either droping hints or being carelessly transparent about which questions she asks when.  She needs some instruction on being a Rouge.  Lying, Spying, and retrieving information are an art-form that go hand in hand.  If you're not good at one, you can't be good at the other.  I think she's not very good at the Retrieving Information part at the moment.  And her lies need work as well.  Oh well.  She should know by now I'm not exactly the most trustworthy of people, but I'm trying to change so it's okay.  I haven't lied in a while, and I'm quite proud of myself thank you.  Unless of course that right there is a lie.  In which case I'm lying that I'm going to change at all.  Meaning you really have no idea whether to trust what I'm saying or not.  Have fun with that.  Moral of the story:  

Lying lessons; only 20$ an hour.  Call 267-994-9364 between the hours of 4:00PM and 7:00PM EST Weekdays for details and arrangements.  Courtesy of the Very Best in Liers; Alex Karpov.

Actually I've been trying to follow the code of Chivalry over the past week or two.  It's turning out nicely.  Being honest isn't half bad.  But it isn't half as much fun either. (Note:  Kids, lying is only fun for the professionals.  Tell your parents the truth and avoid the fate, you'll appriciate the advice later.)  So on a completely unrelated subject.  Adventure course.  It's okay.  We're doing a Trust fall tommorow.  I'll try to conduct myself with valor (As Max would more than likely add ""and not like a pussy either."") and I'm thinking about doing the Full contract thing.  Which means I have to try to do everything.  Not as easy, but hey.  I'd be proud of myself at the end of the day, that's all that really matters.  (Haha.  Fooled you.  You thought it was an unrelated topic.  =P  Tehehe.)

I guess that's enough making an ass out of myself for now, perhaps I'll write again in the next couple days, perhaps not.  We'll see.

If you put my feelings on a graph over the past two days, it'd be crazier than fucking Nitro at Six Flags over in NJ.  JESUS!  Up!  DOWN!!!!! ...up......up.....Up.  Up.  Up!  UP!!  DOWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!

And so on and so forth.  Wiggy is the only possible word to really describe what it was like.

Watched two movies today:

The Last Samurai:  Damn.  That was an amazing film.  Just... awe inspiring.  Inspirational, Relatively Historically accurate, PROPERLY SUBTITLED, with lots of gorey action, katanas blaring.

And fucking ninjas.  Bitching, dude.

Second movie:  Kill Bill Vol. 1 (In prep to see Vol. 2 Tommorow)

This movie was pretty sweet, in all honesty it was alot like a live version of Runrouni Kenshin.  Which, is cool I guess.  They had one scene that was entirely anime, I thought that was pretty kick ass.  Lucy Liu... Droool.  Uma Thurman...Retch.  It also had alot of katana action, but not as well done as The Last Samurai.  All and all, disapointed.  Didn't really live up to Tarintino.  I'm going to go check out Van Helsing tommorow instead of Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Van Helsing looks decent.  Mythological creatures, and a character who through and through is bad ass in any book he or his family has ever been in.  What could be better?  Not alot, people.  Not alot.

So, yeah.  Carnival day... yay?  I didn't get burned.  YAY.

Alex + Sun = Ugly ugly mess
In a compition to see who lasts longer in the blaring sun before getting burned.
Alex < Irish

Yes... The Irish burn slower than I do.  I'm so pale I actually literally reflect sunlight (Yes, this causes frequent injuries.  Also one of a few reasons I hate the beach.  Besides the shrinkage and that unpleasant chilly sensation when the water reaches ""the danger zone."" as Stewart from Mad TV so aptly describes it.)

We stop at the light at Tyburn, right across from Sacred Grounds, you know the one.  And we're behind a shitty grey Buick beater from like 1986.  It was bad.  And anyway the light turned and the bus driver hit the brakes suddenly.  I was oblivious except for minor comprehension.

I realized the car in front of us stalled, and the driver and passenger(both male) jumped out and tried to push the car.  Well, the girl who was in the back got the car to start.  She jumped out and the guys got back in, and before the car could go forward, it rolled onto us and rocked the bus as it hit us.  Less than a minute later, the car speads off and we only get the three letters of the liscense plate.  Funniest, fender, bender, ever. (Pronounce the period, please.  Adds effect.)

So it takes the cops about 30 minutes to get there.  We're holding up traffic for 4 miles. Great time.  And I'm doing my german homework.  Police finally get there, and we have to put down all of our names for court reasons when they find the car.  And around 3 we're allowed to go.  The bus takes us home, I get home at 3:21.  Great ending to a decent day, if I do say so myself.  ...and I got my German homework done.

Brazil - First 3 songs kicked serious ass.  Then it sorta got monotonous.  They are awesome for an upcoming band though.  Influenced it seemed by bands like Death Cab for Cutie, and hint of hXc, as well as the wailing vocals of Post Hardcore and Post Emo.

Funeral for a Friend. - One thing to say about these guys.  They're fucking BRITISH!  SHIT!  No one had any idea.  Haha.  They were pretty fucking awesome though.  They called upon the ancient power of the PIT OF DOOM!  Which entire purpose was to ""Go in, and fuhckin' killl each otha!"" (Note my sorry attempt at the British Accent.""

Rainer Maria -  Oh, so sad.  They really played bad.  Got boo'ed horribly.  And the lead singer (who's name escapes me at the moment) kept doing this funky dance with her one leg... like some fucked up flamino ballarina.

Coheed and Cambria - HELL YES!  And that FUCKING SUCKED!  -------
Reasons for HELL YES!:  It's Coheed.  They played AMAZING!  Played all their most amazing songs, all of which the entire crowd sung back, which was AMAZING.  They came back for an encore, in which we asked for 1 more song.  They played 2 of their best songs (Time Consumer, and Everything Evil) as well as the most awe inspiring 12 minute Prog-Rock Funk improved solo I'VE EVER HEARD!  It was BEAUTIFUL, PEOPLE!  BEAUTIFUL!
-------
Reasons for That FUCKING SUCKED!:  People kept getting in our way, and we couldn't see shit.  I finally had to see for the encore though, so I pushed a kid out of the way.

All in all:  Great show, I really enjoyed it.  Too bad I can't see another show for a while because THERE ARE NO GOOD ONES!  Except for tonight, Motion City Soundtrack and Sugarcult are playing at the Troc."

"event","Hm.  It seems that I have found myself without question in... one hell of a pickle.  First off, I had a hell of a shitty day today, and I'm so pissed off my eyebrows hurt from crunching so much.  That's kind of sad I know, sore eyebrows.  But it goes to show I'm a generally easy going person... I guess.  Anyway.

The other day, I was called ""Pretentious.""  I took a while to ponder on this.  I realized, this is pretty much true.  I was also lovingly refered to as an ""asshole.""  After much consideration I also deemed that this was also correct.

So I happened across something today in my bored frustration and anger.  An article listing various aspects of a typical Pretentious person.  There are as followed.  Borrowed from http://fullyramblomatic.com/ which site I discovered through a LJ user that goes by command_four.  She's also pretentious, but quite entertaining, unlike myself.

4/3/2003: Are You Pretentious?

*- Do you never admit to liking new songs because they're generally created by samey sugary pop bands thrown together by evil capitalist record producers to bleed money from the vital 8-14-year-old schoolgirl demographic?

- Do you object to wearing designer labels, and usually only wear black?

*- Are there any trenchcoats, poloneck jumpers, berets or round dark glasses in your wardrobe?

**- Are you prepared to pay exorbitant prices for frothy coffee beverages just so you can be seen to sit around drinking it?

*- Do you never watch TV?

- Do you watch TV, but complain about it incessantly?

- Do you read obscure news journals because of a deep mistrust for mainstream newspapers?

**- Do you run a website?

- Are you genuinely convinced that lots of people read your website and think it's marvellous?

- Do you try to avoid using Microsoft products?

- Do you frequent any Internet messageboards where topics on the subject of religion or politics drag on for several hundred posts?

- Would you gleefully describe yourself as an 'agnostic atheist'?

*- Do you have few friends?

*- Do you not care that you have few friends?

- Do you try to work dogmatic excuses into almost everything you refuse to do, eg. 'I don't want to vacuum the carpet because vacuum cleaner manufacturers are evil capitalists'?

*- If the people you live with were about to go bowling and you wanted to go but were in a bad mood for some reason, would you refuse to go just so people would realise that you are in a bad mood?

- Are you a published writer, or trying to be published?

**- Do you try really hard to have a negative opinion of all Hollywood films and novels by extremely popular authors?

*- Is the word 'mainstream' for you a byword for 'rubbish'?

- Do you admire Neil Gaiman?

- Are you Neil Gaiman?

If you answered 'yes' to any of the above, then congratulations! You're pretentious! If not, then I'm afraid you're just a boring normal nobody. Look on the bright side, though. At least you'll never be alone.

-Yahtzee

I've taken the time to put a * before the ones that classify my own state of pretention.  ** Mark that part is true, while other parts may not be true.

Pretty pretentious, hm?  Well.  Let's see, that makes me a ""Pretentious Asshole.""  Sounds good to me, fairly insulting, yet sort of a compliment in my twisted thought process.

Someone said I can't dance.  I'm pissed.

Fuck them man.  I can dance just fine.  I'm not a GOOD dancer, but I can dance fine.

Rachel and my quazi-Valentines day(Sunday):  Hung out with Rache' at the mall and her house.  It was nice.  We cuddled and watched chick fliks and spent time together.  Which was a nice change after two weeks of being grounded.  I got her gift at the mall.

Monday and tuesday:  Wasted my life away, as usual.

Today; Wednesday:  Woke up this morning with very self destructive, self defeating, depressing ideas and thoughts which I pondered durring my shower(Da thunk tankz0rz).  I don't know it was kind of weird.  I felt really lost for a good hour or so.  I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life, and I have no direction and time is really closing in on me.  I also questioned Rache' and I, which has happened alot over the past week or so simply because of my mental state.  When I really forget all my little doubts and insecurities about myself, then our relationship returns to it's actual state.  It's just when I'm out of it and self-defeating that I wonder, I ponder, and I consider all negative things that would hurt me in the end.  But, anyway, I returned to my normal state after getting to school and resting my mind with a little meditation before Rachel got there.

The day went pretty smooth, Drivers ed sucked as normally, Math was really funny, but I got no work done, German was cool and we have a party tommorow.  Global studies kicked so much ass, I absolutely love that class.  We learned about Buhhdism today, cool stuff.  And we're doing yoga tommorow.  Sounds like an easy day tommorow.  A party, then yoga.  =)

So, I'll probablly update again tomorrow, but no promisies.  End.

So, I found out about a new c@fe that opened up around us.  For the n00bs that don't know what I mean by ""C@fe,"" it's a cafe that serves coffee, baked goods(in this case, some not), and provides an internet connection for the people there.  High end internet, I'm talking like T1 or T3.  They're commonly called ""Internet Cafes"" or in some cases, specifically ""Gaming Cafes.""  There is a difference.  A gaming cafe offers LAN gaming, as well as outward internet play at a fee per certain ammount of time.  This is greatly appriciated by home-dial-up users especially who can't play the games they want because of low connection speed(12-56kbs).  An internet cafe allows people to eat and enjoy the internet, allows traveling people to check their E-Mail while in town.  And serves as a good meeting place for nerds.

The one that opened up around me as of right now is a ""bring your own hardware"" T1 Internet cafe, from what I could grasp at my time there.  C@fe Dib, is it's name.  So, anyway.

I found out from Marck in Drivers Ed A prd that C@fe Dib had opened up.  He suggested I join their Improv Troupe, (another explination rant.  Basically a ""Who's Line is it Anyway?"" type comedy group).  I figured this may actually be alot of fun, so I took the flyer and thought about.  Then he said that he also worked at the C@fe, and it hit me.  ...That'd be my dream job...  Haha.  For high school anyway.  The three C's that make up some of my primary interests in life.  Note that I say some of.  But they're pretty high up there.  Computers, Comedy, and Coffee.  What can be better?  And I found out that Baked goods would also be involved and I almost died.  So, I thought I'd give it a shot and try for my first job.

So, the day went by after that, I got Rachel a rose and gave it to her.  I would have liked to get her 2 or 3, or a dozen if she'd have let me.  But, they ran out.  I got the last rose.  I'm so upset though, because I wont be able to give Rachel anything else for valentines day because I can't get out of the house, my mom was gone all day, and I can't get out tommorow, we're having company.  I'm mad bummed, I feel really bad.  I know she wont care though.

...So, anyway, to continue about my day.  I got home, and I showed my mom the flier, and she said ""Go for it.""  So it took me like 30 min to work up the courage to call.  I choked on the phone and made an ass out of myself, but that's okay.  She said that I should come and fill out an application.  So I did, 10 min later, my mom gave me a ride over to the C@fe, and I talked to the manager, and he was REALLY nice, he's also the one running the troupe, which makes me feel better about it.  But, they were out of applications, so I wrote down the essentials on a sheet of paper.  So, I was supposed to call or swing on by at around 5, but I totally forgot.  Oops.  =(  I'll call again tommorow.  But, I got home, my mom went shopping, and then she left to go pick up my aunt from the airport, and she's been gone since.   She should be home in about 30 min though.

So, all in all I had a mixed day, but I'm going to put it in the good day section, because I feel like I accomplished something.  Go me.   End."

"event","Woooh.  Got a Live Journal.  Pretty sweet they got rid of the whole journal code thing.  Well, let's see.

Today was actually a good day, haven't had one of them in a while.  Sweet, hm?  So, anyway about this DJ.  Pretty cool hm?  Oh yeahhhh.  I think I'm going to post diffrent stuff in the dj and this one, just to throw all you n00blets off.  I had another idea too, but I'm not too sure about it, it sounds pretty corny.  Tell me what you think.  I was thinking of posting my bad days on DJ, and good days here.  Haha.  Might be pretty cool, actually.  I'll have to set up some links and stuff though, but that'll only take like 3 minutes.  I'll see what you say.

Life is annoying, and difficult. And anytime I feel like I'm on level ground. 
Something fucks it up.
I dreamt about Chris last night.
But woke up thinking about James. 
I've been working a lot. Which I love, but I'm tired.
I don't hang out anymore. And I can't say I really want to.
I have no desire.
People piss me off.
I'm done with that.
Mike is leaving me, in a few days to go back to Louisiana.
I'm jealous, he gets to leave this awful place.
My head hurts a lot.
I bought Coach shoes. Why? Not sure.
I'm obsessed with Laguna Beach and Real World.
I'm sad because Cassie has my dvds of Laguna Beach and she left for 3 weeks.
I'm waiting for James to call me back, I'm guessing he won't.
I'm seeing Eminem at the Tweeter Center on Wednesday.
Can't even express my happiness about that.
I bought Dior mascara. Again, not sure why.
I guess I just really like designer stuff.
To bad I don't make enough money to support my addiction.
School starts September 2nd.
Can't express how much I'm not excited.
Paying for school, makes it even more unappealing.
I guess it'll be good.
Generally I guess things are fine.
Besides the fact that I'm bitter at life.
But ya know.

I hate that feeling of waiting to do things.
And pretty much, I'm always waiting for something.
<center>You make me happy - oh when skies are grey</center>
James and I are okay I think.
We're steady. We're not together, but we're not apart.
It's not the same, but I don't hate it.
We're just alive, and trying not to hurt each other.
Which is a good thing.
Life is kinda funny.
You spend your life wishing for good things to come your way.
Eventually, you get the things you never could have imagined.
Every thing is better than ever.
And in a second, it's gone.
And you're left to pick up your life, and return to what you were originally.
And you think you won't be able to live.
But I was living before him.
And I was okay. So I know I'll be okay eventually without him.
I just selfishly don't want to let go.
Because it was so good.
We're perfect for each other, in every sense of the word.
I fell asleep next to him last night, and it was wonderful.
I just love to snuggle with him. 
I'm going to the beach with Stacey tomorrow.
On Saturday I have to work.
And then Sunday is another outting with James.
He is truly amazing.
I hope he calls me today. Or tonight.
Actually I just hope I see him tonight. Is that wrong?
I always want to be with him. But I hate asking him to hang out with me.
In fear, one time, he may actually say No.
Which has only happened like once. Ever.
I'm sure things will work out okay. And if they don't, I just cry until I feel better.
I miss my friends. I'm thinking, we should probably hang out soon, girls!
Everyone is like doing stuff though. :Life Is Crazy:
I was going to go to California, on Tuesday. But I'm thinking that it's a really bad idea.
Since I'm trying to fix things with James, I shouldn't screw it up by going there.
And inevitably I'd hang out with Shawn. 
Well I guess this is all. I hope everyone is healthy, happy, and having funnn.

"event","Today I planned an outting for James and I.
Along time ago, he had mentioned that he always wanted to go to batting cages.
And it was something that he had never done.
And because the internet is such a wonderful tool, I looked it up.
And found ""Funway"" in Foxboro.
So after waking up around noon (gotta love summer), I called him.
He was on his lunch break, and sounded thrilled that I called.
I asked him what he was going this afternoon, because there was something I wanted to take him too, but it would take a few hours.
He told me he was very nervous about where I was taking him, but said he would call me when he got home.
Around 3:30, Stacey called and I went over to their house anyway to look at her scrapbook.
He came home, and changed and we left.
The whole time he was guessing where I was taking him, but I kept telling him that I was not going to ruin the surprise.
We stopped along the way to look at bikes, because ""he just had too"".
When we got there, he was so amazed. 
We were both all smiles, which made me feel good inside, to know that I made his day a little better.
So we did the batting cage thing for a little bit, and out of like 40 balls, I hit 3. 
Pretty much I just jumped out of the way when they came.
He laughed at me, a lot.
Then we played mini golf. And I won 50-49, or something like that.
Then we went to the mall, to eat Tacobell.
And as we were sitting down, he said ""well now I want to take you somewhere special"". 
And even though I told him he didn't have to, he insisted.
And next thing I know where are we?
Lincoln Park! At the slot machines. Ahhh.
I won $26. But pretty much that's how much I put in them - but at least I didn't lose anything.
The day was so wonderful. And the entire time he kept telling me how happy I make him.
And how amazing I am. And he makes me so happy.
It was just perfect. 
I hope things work out, but after having days like the past few.
I don't see how they couldn't?

"event","So I haven't updated in a while. And I feel like my life has completely changed. Which is probably true in more than one way. But I'm not necessarily happy about it. The end of school was fine. I guess it was sad. But I have to admit the people I thought I would miss - I don't. I feel like I've been through more high school drama in the past month with people who have not been in high school for years, than in my whole high school career combined. And it's wicked childish, and annoying. I don't really know what to do about anything. And I don't want to give up on him, because I know he's worth it. I know he's special and I know he feels the same about me, it's just too hard. And hanging out with him as friends hurts more than not hanging out with him at all. Because all I want to do is cuddle with him, and kiss him and act like we did when things were wonderful. Because they were wonderful. And I was truly happy. I was the kind of happy that I thought I would never be. I was the kind of happy that occrs only in movies. He treated me like a princess. And he acted like I was the only other person in the entire world. When he talked to me - he actually talked to me. It was not a one-sided conversation in which I would talk and he would ignore. He looked into my eyes and was kind and considerate and gentle. But at the same time was funny and witty. And it kills me because he still treats me the same. He acts the same, looks at me the same and continues to call me to just hang out. Which is fine, I suppose. It just hurts. It hurts because Stacey said he did the right thing to break up with me, and that I'm a drama queen for making this into a bigger deal than it should be. I think it is a big deal. And I wish that she understood how much I like him. I wish someone understood. Most people are on completely different ends of the spectrum. They either say don't give up on him, or drop him like a bad habit. And I honestly don't know what would be easier to do. I know that I hurt a lot right now. And I know that when I'm with him, things are insanely good. But I'm also so afraid of being hurt - again. And again and again. I don't want to be vulnerable - but since I already am I suppose I'll give him my heart and want to see what ends up happening to it.

Chris wants me to come out to California, and I want to see him.
I talked to Shawn today and he made me in an even better mood.

I need prom shoes.
I bought my mom the best Mother's Day gifts ever.

Only to be completely disappointed in the end.
And that's awful. But I think it's just my personality.
I just naturally think things will be good. People will be good. Life will be good.
And then when it is horrible, I get so upset.
But I don't know how to not look forward to things.
Shawn doesn't have time for me. Which, I knew.
But he asked me to come out, sooo I thought he would find time?
Apparently not. I'm wicked upset.
All I want to do is cry, and scream and yell and tell him how mad I am.
But I have no right. I'm not his anything.
I really just wanted to go out tonight. I called every one.
And they're either going away, or not doing anything at all.
And as much as they are my friends, they're not the type of people I can sit down with and do nothing with.
I wish I still had Jennifer's number.
But she moved to Laguna Beach and she's the one girl in the OC who doesn't own a cellular telephone.
I'm wicked upset about Shawn.
UGHHH. And I shouldn't be. Because I'm doing such fun stuff.
Thursday night, we went to The Outback for dinner and then went shopping at Old Navy and Tilly's.
Yesterday Chelsey and I went to Fashion Island in Newport Beach, and I got a cute purse at Forever 21. Then we went to Ruby's for lunch.
And the Macaroni Grill for dinner.
I came home, EARLY, didn't go to the movies with her and other people because Shawn said we would hang out.
And then he never called...
Today, I laid out for a few hours, then got ready and Brett and I went to Huntington Beach.
Shopped for hours and got In n Out. 
I mean this is what I was born to do. This is what I love.
But I'm so unhappy, because the one person I really want to see, isn't make the same effort to see me.
And it hurts.

I wonder how many more days he'll wait to call me...
I leave to go there on Thursday morning.
I'm sad right now. And I don't know why.
Today was good. Normal. Fine.
I had a dentist appointment and they scare me.
I tried to clean my room, but it just got worse.
I took all my summer clothes out of bins and put the winter ones in the bins.
And then I color-coded everything. My closet is one big rainbow now.
I'm listening to Akon and I don't know why because the entire cd reminds me of last summer. 
But I just felt the need to. 
Today I was driving down 85, the same way I would go to Chris's apartment. 
And I got so sad. I know the road so well. I know every light, stop sign, turn, pothole.
I even remember where the cops hide. And I miss driving there every day.
It was especially weird when on the radio the song Burn by Usher came on.
When certain songs come on, I always get such a weird feeling inside.
Part of me loves the song because it's good. 
Part of me hates the song because it reminds me of something bad.
And when new songs come out, it's weird to be like ""Chris would love this song"".
I do that a lot when I hear ""Like Toy Soldiers"". I'm not sure why. 
I also feel that way when I hear ""Supposed to die tonight"" by 50 Cent.
It's that strong feeling, where I know if I was with him, those would be the two songs we never stop listening to. 
Just like ""Oh!"" from Obie Trice and ""Patiently Waiting"" from Em and 50 used to be. 
It's weird. I can't describe it.
I feel sad.

I'd be lying if I said this is what I wanted. Because it wasn't.
It's amazing when you have certain plans, and you see your life so clearly.

And this isn't what I had in mind. If I knew this was how things would turn out, I would have just stayed.
I dreamt about Chris last night. Not good. Only bad. Which is generally how that goes.
I think about him all the time. More to look back and realize how far I've come.
But in actuality, I haven't come to far.
I'm still scared, and insecure, and I still want to be liked.
I still do things I don't want to, just to make people happy.
I still don't know how to say no. I still cry myself to sleep, and wake up with red puffy eyes.
I still go through every day with a smile and pretend things are okay. 
And I still think of him constantly. And for what?
For the good memories? I don't think so.
Every thing happens for a reason. I could argue that Chris happened in order for me to move to California.
To meet Shawn, who at the time when we met, was just as lost as I was.
I wonder about Chris all the time. Where he is, what he's doing, who he's with.
If he thinks about me. If I was ever anything to him. Or if I was just another girl.
I just want what I want. And it's selfish, but I don't really care.
And when I think of you, I realize that we could have never been.
And although it makes me sad. It probably could have never worked out anyway.
But like I said, obviously I'm still not over it.
If he was to call, I'd <strike>probably</strike> get back together with him in a second.
He was the best, the worst, the good, the bad, the first, the last, the only. He was everything to me. I haven't seen him in eight months. 
I haven't talked to him in three months.

Me leaving him was earthshattering for me, but for him - it was one less person for him to have to fit on his daily ""let's hang out"" list.

I have to actually find out when his prom is and if he still plans on going.
I should do that tonight. I think I'm going to ask Mike to ours.
Because going to a prom with Mike has been my dream for like four years. Haha...
Everything hurts.
I cleaned my room and I'm excited to wake up tomorrow.
That's such a weird feeling.

"event","I thought about Chris a lot last night before I went to sleep.
Every time I hear Lonely on the radio, I wonder if he remembers listening to that song with me...
Thus I cried myself to sleep and I woke up in a bad mood.
So my day pretty much sucked.
To only get worse when Shawn didn't answer his phone.
Which made me sad.
So I went to tacobell, which made me feel happy.
But made me feel bad, because I told myself not to eat fast food.
So I came home to try to do my paper.
And got distracted downloading songs.
So I tried to make a cd, but it wouldn't work.
So I order a pizza, and when my mom went to pick it up, they told her I never called.
Even though I did.
So basically the day sucked. And I want it to be over. 
And if Shawn doesn't call, it'll be 10000x worse.

It's only $16.50.
I'm getting sick. It's such a wonderful feeling.
I'm wicked excited that I missed Shawn's phonecall today.
Yes, sense my enthusiasm.
I made sure to remember my birth control today.
After this weekend, I hope I never have a child.
I need to write my entire senior paper.
I'm wicked upset, for no particular reason, other than I'm wicked bitter at the world.
Why? I'm not sure. It's not as if the world is out to get me.
I'm pretty aware of that, and I'm aware of all that I have, and could potentially have if I actually worked for it.
I'm mad that life always goes in the opposite direction that I want it too.
I'm mad that I make decisions and then am forced to live with them.
I'm mad that I never realize what I have, until it's gone.
I'm mad that I just can't be happy with what I have now.
I'm mad because my entire existence revolves around a boy whose partying in Las Vegas.
I'm sad because no matter how many people are around, I still feel so alone.
Sometimes I want to scream at everyone. And sometimes I want to freak out.
And sometimes I want to be left alone. And I want to just stare into the nothingness in the room.
Sometimes I feel that having a meaningless conversation is pointless and I'd rather just save my breath because I feel as though I can't breathe as it is.
Most days when I'm in school I can't wait to come home and fall asleep.
Because I don't want to deal with anything. I don't want to talk. And I don't want to worry. And I don't want to listen to anyone.
All I want to do is lay in my bed, under the covers, and feel completely content.
I don't want to be awake. Because when I'm awake I'm sad.
And at least in my dreams I'm with him.
And although I realize other people could possibly feel the same way that I do right now.
I feel more alone than ever.
<center>I'm starting to fashion an idea in my head
where I would impress you with every single word I said
I would come out insightful or brave or smooth or charming
and you'd want to call me
And I would be there every time you'd need me I'd be there every time...
But for now I'll look so longingly waiting...
For you to want me, for you need me, for you to notice me</center>"

I haven't been out, slept, been able to do anything without a crying baby around.
It sucks. I hate this baby. I hate Child Growth. I hate Mrs. Laflash.
This is not fun. Babies are not just cute clothes, little shoes.
Nothing is cute. It cries. And screams. And cries. And wakes up at ridiculous times.
I'm never doing this for real. I couldn't even sit through dinner tonight.
It screamed. Whatever. I knew I hated kids. 
I watched John Q tonight. No matter how many times I watch it, I still cry.
I bought the Hawthorne Heights cd, and My Chemical Romance cd the other day. 
Shawn would be so proud.
I saw Hitch again last night. It was just as good as it was the first time.
I miss Shawn a lot, and wish that he wasn't in Las Vegas because then he might call.
At least he told me he wouldn't call me until tomorrow. So at least I'm not waiting - totally kidding, I'm waiting.
I'm listening to Game. I watched this thing on 50 cent today.
I don't have a life this weekend, and I should just stay home and catch up on work.
I forgot my Anat book at school though and I still didn't answer all the questions for Monday, so whatever.
I got a job in Medway. A receptionist at a saloon. Pretty coool.
I hung out with Meg and Kelly tonight. T'was a good time with the exception of the crying baby.
I drank to many cokes today and now I feel sick.
I feel sick in general. 
My friend Monique from CA got arrested a few days ago for forging her mom's signature in order to get out of school.
Not that it's funny - cause she did get arrested. But it's funny because she used to sign notes for Shawn and I all the time and she never would do it for herself because she didn't want to get in trouble.
And the first time she did, she got in trouble. And since she's 18, it's like a federal crime or something. Ha..
Mike's home this weekend and I really want to hang out with him but I can't handle the child.
I feel really sad. And not for any particular reason. I guess I just want to feel sad.
I suppose I'm pretty content though. Despite the sadness.
It's important to feel sad. Because then when something good happens.
Your especially happy. And that's a wonderful feeling.

Today I tried on all my formal dresses that I own. 
I fit into all of them but 1. The red one I wore Freshman year to Winter semi.
It's the same size as the other ones. But it looks awful.
Therefore my goal is to fit into it. Soon.
My mom told me it's normal that I don't fit into it. But I want to.
I want to lose 6 pounds. Because that's what I've gained in one month since I moved back from California.
That is insanely ridiculous. And I'm freaking out. 
However, I refuse to not eat. I enjoy food too much.
And I refuse to give up anything, because I like it. Haha...
My mom told me if I just actually did sit ups and walked on the treadmill for a few weeks, I could probably do it.
But it's kinda like that Snickers commerical where the guy weighs himself, runs around the room, and gets back on the scale and he's disappointed that he weighs the same. I want faster results.
I have a pair of 7's that are 26's and I want them to fit, like no other.
Like I want to be 103 RIGHT now. 
So I guess my goal is two weeks. Starting tomorrow though. Ahhh.
I need to start wearing my retainer every night. I always forget.
I called Shawn yesterday because I missssss him. But he was out, so we talked for a few and I said goodnight. And that was that.
At 330, I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep. So I called him.
He answered, and told me this really confusing story about how he's drunk and just needs to sleep.
I just said oh. And he said ""wait are you okay? do you want to talk?"" and I said no go to sleep. He asked if I was sure, but what was I suppose to say?
I eventually fell back to sleep, and woke up at 6 to find out I could sleep until 8.
The first day back was hard. All the Anat work wasn't due, and I got really mad.
I have to write a paper for that class, and read for english. But all I want to do is just sit here and listen to Greenbrier Lane.
I miss Shawn. A lotttttt. I don't know what we are.
I got my tax returns back and they spelled my name wrong on the check.....
He better call me tonight. I'll be very sad. I'm already very sad. 
I suppose I have nothing left to say.

Apparently I cause a lot of drama, but he assures me I never came up in the speech.
When he found out I went out with Chris the other night, he was like whhhat.
And got all jealous, and told me that he'd be a lot happier if I didn't go out with guys on dates.
I told him then he wasn't allowed to go out with girls. He says he doesn't plan too.
And that I was the only girl he wanted to hang out with.
So I don't really know what this means. Could we possibly be dating... soon?
I went out to lunch with him today and then after went to my old work.
I was standing there, and he was fixing this guys bike and the guy looks at me, and he's like ""hello my name is Danny"" or something. And put his hand out to shake mine.
And I was like Oh, I'm Jasmine. He's like ohh like the movie.. I was like Yup I suppose.
He's like well what do you do for fun Jasmine. 
And I kinda looked at Shawn and he's just staring this kid down like how are you doing this right in front of me.
And I'm like oh, you know... he's like do you party?
He ended up inviting me to this party and all this crazy stuff. I'm just like uhhh.. 
When he left Shawn was like I want to kill him. I just laughed but inside I couldn't believe that just happened either.
I was telling him about me and Chelsey living together next year and he said that would be cool but he doesn't know about me living with a sorority girl.
I told him she wasn't a sorority girl, she was my cousin.
He told me they cheat. I told him he did too... and he shut his mouth.
We're going to a drift show tonight. How that is fun, I don't know.
He told me to go home, and get a jacket and he'd pick me up when he got off.
So I'm waiting. And I have butterflies, and a headache, and I feel anxious.
But I also really do not want to say goodbye to him. I don't want to cry.
I want to be strong, but I can't. I fall apart in his arms.
Which I'm not sure is a good or a bad thing? I guess I'll be happy.

We talked a lot about next year and living with each other.
I'm very excited. I'm pretty sure it's actually going to happen too.
If I don't get into Long Beach, then I'm just going to go to a different community college in that area.
But it's gonna be wicked cool. I can't afford more than $700 a month though.
And I can't really afford that. That price is without food or utilities.
It's gonna be such a crappy apartment, but it shall be an experience.
All I want to do is hang out with Shawn. Not for a long time.
I just want to see him. And I'm selfish. So I want it to be right now.
And I came out here to see him. And I think he should hang out with me.
He's putting me in a bad mood. To the point where I don't want to do anything.
And I know he is at work. And I should be glad he is there.
But I am not glad. I want him to be with me. Right now. Because he told me we would hang out before I left.
And I don't even think that is going to happen now.
And I'm in a wicked bad mood. And all I want to do is go to sleep.
But it's only 8. And I don't want to be lame and wait around.
For him to finally decide to call me when he gets out of work.
Because I have no idea when that will be. But that's all I want.
And I know that is what would make me happy. If he just called.
But I know when he does get out of work, I am not the girl he is going to call.
Which makes me more sad, and more disappointed and more frustrated.
And it makes me feel like more of a loser because I'm sitting here waiting around.
For a boy that I know won't call.
When there's two other boys who are waiting to hang out with me, and I keep saying no.
And Chelsey wants me to go to the club and I keep saying no.
And I'm waiting.
I feel like my whole life is about waiting.
For something better to come along.
But nothing ever does.

And I need to spend it before I go home because the only Forever 21 that I know about at least is in the Providence Mall... and I'm not about to drive there to spend it. So I went down the street and really wanted to buy something. But they didn't have anything that I had to have. So I thought about just getting something random. But I don't want to waste my money. So I'm gonna wait, yet again.
And I went to Nordstroms and I promised myself that I wouldn't buy anything. But I had too. Uhhh, I know. But it was only 16 dollars and it's pink!
Then I had to come home because I was thirsty and I'm to cheap to buy a drink out since I just bought drinks the other day. 
I despoited a check in the bank and I'm way excited because now I have $300 in my checking account. And I haven't despoited my tax returns yet. Not that that is very much.
<b>It's almost someone's birthdayyyy</b>
I'm waiting for Shawn to get out of school. So we can go on an adventure. I really hope we're still going. I will cry.
Or maybe just go back to sleep.
I have something in my eye.
My hair did it's own thing today, kinda upset about it too.
I really wanted to buy a baby phat shirt. But it was 36 dollars and I wasn't really willing to spend that much.
I think something is wrong with me.
Or maybe I'm starting to grasp the concept of money....... no that can't be.
I'm cold. My uncle is home right now which he never is because he lives in New Hampshire. But he's home and he never feels coldness. So he has all the windows and doors open. And yes it's California. But it's only 55. And that's pretty cold if you think about inside the house being that temperature.
Personally, I'm pretty unhappy about it.
That's pretty much why I went out this morning, I was so cold I didn't want to stay in the house. I was out the door by 9:30.
I wonder what I should have for lunch. I should probably eat here, since I'm going out for dinner.
I love Kanye West.
I wish Shawn would text me back.
I need to get my nails done.
Alright maybe I should find something more productive to do.

It was just awkward, and tiring, and long. 
I got my oil changed and had to wait for over an hour.
Most boring time of my life, except for the over-dramatic girls working there, making scenes because one calls the other's boyfriend to often...
Then I left and was trying to decide what to eat for lunch.
I decided on In n Out and Steve called me and asked if I wanted to go with him.
So I agreed. And 5 hours later, I'm sitting at his house still, watching the Bourne Identity.
It was awkward because he brings up Shawn so often. And told me that he's jealous of him.
I told him he really didn't have any reason to be.
I'm listening to How Come. I haven't heard this song in a loonnng time.
It reminds me of Chris. Soo soo soo very much. Wow...
I called Shawn a few minutes ago and he was about to take a shower, but he told me how he's taking me to a place I'll love tomorrow.
And I was like whhatt. And he's like I'm gonna take you to Inglewood and Crenshaw Blvd.
And I'm wicked excited. Because I'm the one girl in the world, who thoroughly enjoys dangerous situations and places where everyone is black. And I'm the minority. :)
I guess he went there today, and felt out of place with his Plain White T's cd.
So tomorrow we're gonna go and I'm gonna bring MY cds. 
I'm excited. And then at night I'm hanging out with Chris. I can't cancel on him.
I refuse to be mean, I'm gonna go and have fun. I don't know what we'll do.
I talked to Curtis today and I'm gonna hang out with everyone from Capo on Saturday I think. Should be a good time.
I'm bored. Crazy bored. And I wanted to watch the OC, but I'm pretty over it now.
I guess I have nothing left to say.

Tuesday I came to California. 
The flight was interesting. I thought I was going to die. And when I first got on the plane the guy sitting next to me had MY tray table down with HIS drink on it. And didn't move it, or seem sorry. I was like are you fucking kidding me?
My friend Chris got the new 50 cent cd that doesn't come out until March 8 and he's burning it for me.
This morning I woke up to a text that said ""i want you to come cuddle with me"" from Shawn.
Which automatically put a smile on face, thus everything else in the day fell exactly into the right place.
So I got ready and drove to his house, and we just laid in bed all day.
And nothing could have made it more perfect.
Except maybe, if I was his girlfriend. Or something.
But it was great. We watched the Italian Job and I asked annoying questions that he willingly answered with a smile on his face.
When he had to go to work, I went home and watched tv for a while.
Then I decided to make cupcakes, and they actually cooked.
I talked to Stacey for a while. It was a nice talk.
Then I watched more tv, did some anat.
Went out to dinner. Talked to some people online.
And here I am. 14 hours of my day.
And now I'm tired and Shawn just called to say goodnight.
So maybe I'll just go lay in bed and think about my pro's and con's list again and remind myself why I left him.

After all of my darkness and sadness, soon comes happiness.
If I surround myself with positive things, I'll gain prosperity.
I'm whitening my teeth. They feel weird.
Happy late Valentine's Day. I hated it.
Cassie and I got our nails done today. The lady killed her.
I hadn't talked to Shawn in two whole days. Well actually like 1 and a half.
So I called him and he was in Downtown Disney.
Must be nice. Wish I was..........
He promised me he would call me before he went to sleep.
I just did an art homework. 
I feel like today is someone's birthday... or some major day?
But I don't remember what.
I miss Chris.
I wish I was Mariah Carey. 
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face.
And sure they tell you, you'll never pull through.
Don't hestiate, stand tall and say.....

I've been freaking out lately.
I've been feeling kinda sad lately.

My bed is the most comfortable, and warm place that I can be. I'm happiest there. I'm happiest in my room. Alone. I like to be alone. I don't want people around me constantly. I want Jasmine time. I need Jasmine time. When I'm around people to long, I freak out. On everyone. And sometimes I don't mean too. But usually I just want people to back off. I don't really like people. I think they are selfish. Obviously I'm including myself in that assumption. People for the most part, are not nice. They are not considerate or kind or good-hearted. Most of the people I meet every day I wish I hadn't. Some I'm glad I did. I don't mind staring at my wall for hours. It doesn't bore me. Sometimes I would rather listen to music, all by myself for hours in my room, than go out with friends. Sometimes that makes me happy. Sometimes it makes me more sad. But either way it allows me to think. And usually I don't think about anything. Sometimes I just tell myself happy stories about how I hope my life turns out, but usually I know it won't happen. I will never meet Eminem. I will never be wealthy. I will never be happy. That's pretty much what I'm left with after every conversation with myself. Which is fine. I can deal with it. What I can't deal with, is the fact that what if I don't do anything worth while when I'm alive. I want to make the world a better place. I want someone that I don't know, to look up to me. I want to make a difference in someone's life. And I'm not sure that will happen. I want the world to be a better place, because I was in it. And when I talk to my friends, they act like there's a little possibility that could happen. That I have the potential to matter, but what if I don't? Mike called me today to say ""I just wanted to tell you that I love you"". And it meant so much, because people don't do that anymore. How often does someone just call to say hi. Or see how you are. To see if you're still alive. When I was in California people called me all the time. You should see my recent recieved calls now. No one calls. No one answers my phone calls, and no one calls back. Which is fine I can get over it. What I can't deal with, are judgements from people that don't understand. So maybe they think they know what's going on, but you don't. And you won't. Because you don't take the time to ask. I am sorry. I've come to the realization that I may have been a little wrong. So I apologize. It's not like it matters anyway. The first thing out of his mouth after was a statement of regret. I hope every one is happy. Maybe I am a bitch and I'm wrong, and I'm mean and selfish. But so is everyone else. A person's goal in life is to get ahead and unfortunately that requires you to walk all over other people. So yes, I'm a follower. That is wrong. I'm independent, and I'm losing my mind. I'm obsessive-complusive. I'm always sick. I'm insecure. I'm an untalented girl, who lacks the courage to some days - to even get out of bed. It's a struggle every day. And every night I cry myself to sleep, but somehow find the courage to believe that tomorrow might be better. And every morning I realize that it won't be. And sure, the suns always shines and the wind always blows, and people always move on with their lives. Whether you get out of bed or not - the day continues. With or without you. How small does that make you feel? To know, that you don't matter. You make no impact on whether the sun is going to shine or the rain is going to fall, or the birds are going to sing. Every thing will still go on. And he will go on. And he does go on. Which is fine. No matter how well you know a person, you can never know them completely. And no matter how much you trust a person, you always know there's that slight risk of them breaking it. Trust - something that takes years to build and seconds to destroy. And no matter how much you love somebody - you know they will one day inevitably betray you, or hurt you. They will go against you, no matter how much you try for it not to happen. It will. And when it does, even though you saw it coming, you're devastated. And I can look back and realize now where all my relationships with every single person in my life went wrong. You just know. Like everything there are warning signs. Those littles things, that you choose to ignore because it's conveinent. Convienence is an interesting thing. And convienence is always a cause for a disconveinence in another area of your life. Life is an interesting concept all together. How someone can have a life, and their life goes on without me around still amazes me. How every single person in the world, wakes up every day and does their own thing, amazes me. And it gives me hope. Hearing stories about people who are worse off than me, gives me hope. Because I always feel like, well they're still living. And I have a lot of good things. So why am I still sad? I don't have a reason to be. I like a lot of things. So what makes me so negative. I try to be positive on the outside. To make believe that I'm happy on the outside so maybe one day I might actually start to believe that I'm happy. My smiles are fake. My laughs are fake. I go through the day crying on the inside. For no particular reason other than that is what makes me feel good. Crying isn't about crying for the sake of crying. It's a way to release pain and energy from my body. So don't tell me not to cry. Or to stop, or that it doesn't help. Don't tell me things will be okay, because you don't know that. Did you look into a crystal ball? Tell me my future. Don't say you know what I'm going through. I don't even know. How can you? Maybe you can relate. That's fine. Tell me you can relate, but you don't know. You can't know. All you know is what I tell. And all I tell is what you ask. And remember... no one takes the time to ask anyone anymore... It's ironic that the people you ignore and are rude too, are usually the people that are there for you in the end. Because people are so quick to judge, most never see the true side of someone. Which is sad, that really makes me sad. I know the world is full of people I might like, but they probably pissed me off not even meaning to with in the .03 seconds I met them. So meet me. I'm 18. I'm crazy. I love rainbows. And sunshine. And happy things that have the potential to then in turn make me happy. I'm proud to be an American. I hate war. I'm not anti-Bush. I drink soda. A lot. I don't like cigarettes. I don't like drugs. I don't like to drink. I believe if you find yourself smoking alone - you have a problem. I sleep with stuffed animals. I still believe in the monsters in my closet. My greatest fear is drowning. I hate spiders, and all bugs. I hate driving. I love watching the same movies over and over. I like watching candles burn, but I'm afraid of fire. I love shopping. I love clothes. I love burning cds. I love Eminem. I love artwork. I hate the cold. I hate the snow. I've never been to a middle state. I died 5 times the day I was born. I can't swim. I love baking. I like the beach. I hate hills. Tacobell now makes me sick. Pepsi makes me sick. Phones are evil. I didn't have hair until I was 5. I stayed back in 4th grade. I've been to 5 different schools. My parents aren't - and were never married. They had me at 18. I'm half Puerto Rican, but I don't get tan. I love jackets. Boys are lame. I collect shoes. I would live in California if money wasn't an issue. I have no desire to go to college. I have 3 friends that I would trust with my life. I get along with my parents. I love victorian houses. I already have my wedding planned. I love ouija boards. According to it, I'm going to die when I'm 79. I don't have any complaints. I make wishes at 11:11. And pray they come true. I wear a cross, because I want desperately to believe in God. I don't know if I do. I believed in Santa till I was 13. I love concerts. Oprah is my idol. I hate watercolor. I hate the smell of freshcut grass. It makes me want to puke. I like the smell of gasoline. I hate the radio because too many songs remind me of too many people and it makes me sad. I've had one boyfriend. My room is red. I've always wanted to live in Long Beach. I'm always tired. I hate working.I'm superstitious. I can't wait for prom. I can't wait for this year to be over so I can leave again. I regret leaving in the first place, however I regret coming back even more. And while I don't want to die, sometimes I wish I could just disappear...</lj-cut>"

"event","Today would have been me and Chris's one year anniversary. 
To bad, he sucks.
I talked to Shawn today. That pretty much equals all my happiness.
He pretty much makes my day just by calling. We don't even have to talk for long.
Just by knowing that he's thinking of me, and takes the time to call.
I enjoy him. He told me I was his favorite.
I started that saying with him, when I realized with all my other friends I say I love you. Just randomly. But with him, it was different and I couldn't just say that. So I started saying You're my favorite. And now he says it to me :)
Stacey got a tattoo today. It's crazy. But awesome.
I could never do that. I'm to afraid. 
Plus I don't know what I would get.
I've decided to do my senior paper on dating violenece, and why someone would stay in an abusive relationship.
Reading other peoples stories make me so upset, because I sit there and say ""he used to say that stuff to me"" or ""that happened to me"". It's such a weird feeling.
I can't wait to see Shawn. I'm honestly, so excited. Like never been so excited to see someone before, except maybe Mike the year he was in Louisiana.
I made a Blessid Union of Souls cd today. It's so good. It makes me the good kinda sad. 
I want pizza. But I promised myself I would regulate the eating.
I decided to give up soda for lent. But since I forgot it started on Wednesday and forgot to stop drinking it... I pretty much gave up trying to give it up.
But I only had 3 today....? That's awful.
Some people really make me upset. And sometimes I wish I could just yell at them.
And freak out. And scream, and cry, and be dramatic, and reveal my true feelings. 
But I'm pretty sure, my only friend left would be myself.
I need a job, and Mark from Iparty really wants me to come back there. But I don't want too. I feel like that chapter of my life is over, and there's no need to re-read it.
I wish someone would talk to me, and I know he won't.
I have split-ends. Which is weird, considering I've NEVER had them before.
I have my lava lamps on. I forgot how much they calm me.
I'm home so early tonight. I officially have no life...
Like I thought when I came back, I would never be home and stuff.
Because before I was never home. But now I realize I was never home because I was always with Chris or Mike.
Both of which, are impossible for me to consume all of my time with anymore.
Which thoroughly makes me upset.
Well somewhat. I guess on some level I never wanted to go out tonight, so I'm glad that I'm home. But now there's nothing to do.
I wish I had money, it would make a lot of things simpler.
I'm trying not to smoke weed. Because Shawn asked me not too. And I haven't since I've been back. But it's so hard to say no. Like before, I was like yah whatever. But after saying yes for so long, it's so hard to start saying no again.
I'm hungry.
I hate when people don't say thank you. For things they really should. Like they just assume that it's your duty to do something for them. When clearly it isn't. It fucking aggravates me to no end. Like it's just common curtiosy when someone does a favor for you, no matter how routine, you say thank you.
I'm greatly against Valentine's Day. I hate it more than any day. Besides 9-11.
I got my report card. 2 As, 2 Bs and 1 C. Yeahhhhhhh
I'm to mad to finish this.
<b>Just let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be.</b>"

"event","Shawn and I are good. I'm trying to buy a plane ticket to see him.
Apparently my mom doesn't want me to, and won't spot me the money for a few days.
Whatever. She'll get over it.
It's amazing how quickly a persons mood can go from wonderful, to suicidal.
I think I might be crazy. Or bi-polar. 
I freaked out today for no apparent reason. Guess I'm over it.
I IMed Steve today. He was on away message.
I miss him, kinda. And I miss Chris Ho from work. I think he's picking me up from the airport. He said he would.
He goes to Irvine Valley College, maybe I should apply.
My dad made me a cd and it has The Game, 50 cent, Eminem, Dre and Eamon.
I love my dad.
I miss California. Apparently a high-speed chase ended right by where I was living. My aunt said she thought the police helicopter was going to land in her spa. 
It obviously didn't.
I'm pretty upset with everyone right now. I won't lie.
People piss me off.
I just colored for anat. It's the first time I did hw for it.
That's rough. Shawn called me from anat the other day. I miss it. I miss him.
A lot. He called me last night and we talked forever.
<center>I wish I had a Valentine.</center>
Chris was mine last year.
I wore Shawn's GBL shirt last night. 
Jamieson won't stop calling. It makes me upset.
Mike is making me upset. Everyone is making me upset.
I just want...
I went to the Pats parade. It was crazy, but really fun.
But really tiring. I'm not able to enjoy a full day though.
Everytime I lay down, I get a headache.
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't stop me from falling asleep.
But I could sleep through anything, but it's annoying.
And when I stand up, I always see black dots.
It's odd.
I'm going to marry Tom Brady, or 50 cent.
I found a diary from when I was in 7th grade. I was pretty fucked up then.
I won't lie.....
Shawn told me he would always be there for me when I needed him. 
I guess I sounded sad last night, or something. He was like Jasmine, just talk to me.
But there was nothing he would understand. He said, ""try me"".
Why do I do this to myself...
I'm getting my hair cut. 
I'm annoyed. And I want money, but I don't want to work.
I don't want to go to school tomorrow, but I don't want it to snow.
And I want people to start telling me what the fuck is going on.
<b>They say I'm no good, cause I'm so hood. Rich folks do not want me around. Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off, somebody gon get laid the fuck out. They call me new money, say I have no class, I'm from the bottom I came up to fast, hell if I care I'm just here to get my cash.</b>"

"event","I thought about Chris a lot today. To much. To the point where I got really upset, and couldn't focus on anything. And all I wanted to do was be in his apartment. On his couch, looking out the windows, listening to Akon, with him. And I missed the feeling of driving to his house, listening to Kanye and being so excited, just to see him. Because at first, it was good. And those first few minutes where I first got there and he would walk down and open the door. And look at me and be excited to see me. And would wrap his arms around me and it was good. And it was crazy, and it was stupid, but it was exciting. And I can honestly say not one day with him was boring. And right now, I'd take all the pain again just to have someone to be with. Just to have someone calling my phone, and wondering if I want to hang out. And to have someone to hug all the time, and be close with all the time. And it would be so easy to go back to him. And I want to go back to him. But I know I wouldn't be happy. I only think I would be happy, because I'm so miserable now. And it's not even that I'm miserable now. I'm not. Usually. I'm just upset, because I hate having my heart set on something and then it completely getting crushed. Over.. and over again. And then I wonder why I set myself up to fall. Because I clearly do. It's obvious to everyone. But people let me believe, it will happen. Until I believe, and then they slowly tell me no. And then I slowly get hurt. And I'm left. And everytime I'm left, my heart goes back to the one person, the one boy, where it all began and everything in me wants to call him and make him make me feel better. I want to go to where he is, crawl into his bed, curl up with him and just cry. And I want him to care. And I know that he wouldn't. And it's been almost a year. One year ago, tonight, I was with him. And it makes me sad. Really sad. Because I wanted it to work out so much. And today thinking about every boy that I've ever wanted it to work out with, he was the only one I actually invested everything in to. And I tried so hard. And he didn't see it. And I called Shawn. Because I was feeling a little down. And we talked and it was good. But it isn't the same. He has a life. He has a girlfriend. Chris has a life. Most likely a girlfriend. And I'm here. Alone. And there completely different people, and should never be compared. But why is it, I can't be happy with a good-hearted person or a cruel-hearted person. What does that make me? Where does that leave me? And I don't want to be lonely and I don't want to be alone. And I'm not asking for all the happiness in the world. I'm just asking for one thing, one small event, one minor act of cuteness that would make me feel special. But I wish it to be from you...

"event","I don't have a way of getting to school tomorrow.
Not really sure what I'm going to do about that.
So let's see what I'm trying to say here.
I had a pretty good day at school.
A really good afternoon and now I'm just hanging out.
I tried to watch American Idol, but it's just awful.
So I'm listening to my cd.
It's wonderful.
I talked to my aunt about coming out for Feb vacation. 
She said that I should come out on the Tuesday of vacation which was what I planned on.
Well she actually said I could come earlier, but they wouldn't be there.
They're going to Tahoe.
And I don't want to go earlier, because everyone I know is going snowboarding that weekend.
Maybe I should have learned how.
So I'm thinking of going on Tuesday on the early flight, get there around 10 am.
And then coming home on Saturday at 3, so that I can hang out with Cassie on her b-day.
Although the sun will never shine, I'll always look to brighter days...
I went to Northboro and towns like that today, and was so afraid.
Suddenly a rush of memories came back to me that I would rather forget.
I told something to someone today that I really mean, but after said ""just kidding"". 
Even though I wasn't.
Miss Kinkela, is crazy, but so nice.
I want Shawn to call me.
He's working.
Blah.
Maybe I should ask him to prom...
I won't have a date, and it would kinda be cool. 
Tomorroow I'm mailing him a picture and a cd.
I got a new Eminem poster. Two actually. One is black and white and is HUGE.
It looks so good.
The music is the key.
Sometimes I feel like people think I'm someone, and I'm not the person they think I am.
But if I show them how I really am, they'll be like 'you've changed'.
When I really haven't, I've just never acted like myself.
And sometimes I wish I could just say things without caring. 
Because there's a lot of things I would say.
And I wish I could do things, ""out of the norm"" without causing a commotion.
I wish I could be me.
But then I realize I don't know what that is...
So I go through everyday with a smile on my face.
Because I don't know what else to do.
And I cry at night, because it's the only comfort I know.
And when Shawn calls me early in the morning, I talk to him.
Because he's the person I wish I was with.
And it's comforting for me to know, that there is that one person who thinks about me before he goes to sleep.
Who wouldn't appreciate that?
So yah I complain that I'm tired, but most of that is because I'm not on this time yet.
And I'm just annoyed.
Brett told me Shawn is lost without me. 
And she saw him in school and he looked sad.
So she said hi, and he was like ""Have you talked to Jasmine??""
And she was like I talk to her every day, and he said ""yah me too.. I want her to come back"".
And our Anat teacher said something to him and he was like ""I can't go on, I have no reason to live without her"".
So he said, Shawn just focus. And he said I don't want to. I want her to come back.
I think it's cute.
We're gonna be together.
Hahahah...

Although I wish it was. So, I'm going to focus everything on Shawn. And the fact that he called me last night ""just to hear my voice"". And we talked for 2 hours. And it was wonderful. And made me feel special. Because he makes me feel like I matter. Not that others don't. There's just something different about how he treats me. And he treats me really well. Considering, I am insane. And he's a boy that I hope I'll know forever. And I'm not in love with him, but I care about him a lot. I get butterflies when I see ""OC balla :-)"" calling my phone. And he told me he ""gets giddy"" when he sees ""J-wigga"" calling his phone. He told me that I'm the person who brings him back to his childhood. And that I'm the person that reminds him of the things he used to get excited about when he was little, and that he should still be excited about. That I put the kid back in him. I think that's good. I just made a cd that reminds me of him. I think I'm going to send him a copy. It has-
<center>The White Stripes - We are gonna be friends
Mariah Carey - One sweet day
ATC - All around the world
A Napolean Dynamite skit
Soul Kid - More bounce in California
Cindy Lauper - Time after Time

Eminem - Puke

Aladdin - A whole new world</center>
It's wonderful. I could tell a story for each song, that involves Shawn. I miss him a lot. It's weird. I have attachment problems I think. But he calls me more than I call him. So I think I'm doing well. I've only called him 3 times. He's called me like 6 or 7. I'm really sad. I don't like Nipmuc. Not that I enjoyed Capo. I hate all school. And I like the people at Nipmuc better. I just don't want to be there at all. It makes me sick, to think about the fact that I still have 4 months. I don't think I can do it. I hate that I have to live with my parents for 4 months. I love them dearly, but it was wonderful not having to listen to them bitch. I thought I missed them but I think I just was mistaken. I loved how I was living in California. And I'm slowly starting to realize that's it's true...

"event","So I've decided, I'm going to school. 
But in California.
Because I'm a loser and don't know what the hell I want in life.
So I'll just continue to go back and forth.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
I THINK I got into Cal State Fullerton.
They sent me tons of information on the college, financial aid, Pre-law since that's what I put as my major, the sports teams, housing. 
Everything.
And that's what they do.
So I'm just waiting for the letter.
I don't really want to go there.
I'd like to go to Long Beach.
If I don't get in, I'm still moving there.
And I'll go to Community college, since it'd be better.
Cause I don't know what I want to do yet.
And my cousin Chelsey said we should get an apartment together.
And that would be cool.
We've said that since we were like 5. 
And it most likely will happen.
And I'll be happy.
Now the only thing is, I need to learn to save money.
Because if I want this ""brilliant"" plan to happen, I need money.
So I have like, $700 to my name. 
If I can just hold off on shopping, I think I could do it.
But for 6 months, til I go there? Ouch...
I needa job. I'll do anything.
Except, the public, food and clothes.
So basically I'll answer the phone and make copies.
I miss Shawn. A lot. But I haven't cried, except when I said bye to him.
So I think I'm doing good. 
Don't cry over anyone who wouldn't cry over you.
I keep listening to Greenbrier Lane though.
Kinda funny.
I called him and left him a message.
And I really want him to call me back.
I'm trying to convince him to come out Feb vacation.
He says it's to cold.
My mom is crazy. My dad is not.
I saw Mike, is was wonderful.
I wonder if I've changed.
If I have, I hope it's for the better.
And I think it is.
I thought about Chris today, because I always do.
But I was on RT 9 by his exit. 
And then I realized that he doesn't live there anymore.
I was in the mall (I didn't buy anything) and I wondered if I would see him.
And I got scared.
I saw Jessie Lavin's mom. I don't think she knew it was me. 
I miss Shawn.
He asked me to prom. I hope he was serious. He sounded serious. 
But I don't know if Brittany will be all about that.
Hopefully she'll get over it.
It's cold.
I hate the snow.
I want to see people.
But everyone is busy. Which is fine.
I need a ride to school in the morning.
I'm willing to pay someone.
Stacey got pulled over last night, after drinking at a party.
And we had a quarter of weed in the car.
She got off with a warning, for failure to use turn signal?
How.. I don't know. We rule.
Steve makes me feel like shit because I don't feel the same way about him that he does about me.
I wish I did. But I don't.
I cleaned my whole room, it's awesome.
I got rid of soooo much stuff.
You can actually tell my closet is a walk-in closet.
I'm bored.
I want to take a nap but today I didn't wake up until 1.
So I know I'm going to have an issue waking up at 6 tomorrow morning for school.
SO I'm trying to stay tired till like 9.
I'm gonna go make Shawn a cd.
I love life.
<b>Oh I'll get by, and keep on trying. I will not cry for you. I won't ask why, put it behind me. And carry on with my heart broken in two. As days go by the pain inside me, will fade away like you...</b>"

I had no idea where we were going.
And when we got to Laguna Beach I was excited.
But when we went to ""top of the world"" it was beautiful.
It's a park on top of a mountain.
And you can see for miles.
One way is the ocean and the beach.
Another way is the mountain ranges.
And the other way is where we live.
It was beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it.
And he was like ""look what you're leaving behind"".
And I got really upset.
But didn't want to show it.
And we took pictures.
And they came out good, it was kinda cloudy though.
We stayed for like an hour, and just talked about being a bird.
And being able to fly whereever we wanted.
And then we left.
And he held my hand in the car. 
And I didn't want to let go.
And I started to cry.
But I didn't want him to know.
And he gave me one of his shirts.
But when it was time to actually say goodbye.
I couldn't stop crying.
And I held on to him so tight.
And we stood in the middle of the street for 10 minutes while I cried on him.
And he explained to me that it would be okay.
And that we'll still see each other.
And that I would be happy once I'm home.
And he kissed me on the forehead.
And then on the lips.
And I couldn't breathe.
And it was the hardest goodbye I've ever said.
And I bawled the whole way home.
And then a few hours later he called to see how I was.
And told me he's coming over tomorrow morning before I leave.
And I realized that it's going to be even harder saying goodbye again..."

It's not a regret.
But I don't know if it's an accomplishment either.
I'm not too proud.
Or sad.
I'm kind of happy.
And kind of angry with myself.
Because it's kinda stupid.
Leave it to me, to get involved with someone 3 days before I move.
Only I would let my emotions get hurt like that.
This is so dramatic.
But for the first time when I saw Brittany today.
I wasn't upset, and I wasn't annoyed.
I was thinking I'm so sorry.
And for the first time, I understood why she doesn't want me around him.
But at the same time, I was thinking.
<center>I slept with your boyfriend and you have no idea</center>
And that made me feel better about myself.
I know.
I'm a bad person.
But what goes around comes around.
So I'll get mine.
However, personally... I did nothing wrong.
I don't have a boyfriend... 
I didn't cheat on anyone.
I'm 18.
Legally I can do whatever I want within limits.
So.
There.
It's justified.
I could never cheat on someone.
It's such an awful thing.

About something that I can't talk to anyone about.
Which is kinda shitty.
And makes me feel worse.
And makes me feel like a bad person.

And I try to be happy but I can't be.
Because I'm bitter.
And it all comes down to the fact that I'm selfish.
And I want what I want when I want it.
And that's wrong.
But how do you control your feelings?
How do you tell yourself not to feel one way or another?

Why can't he leave me alone?
Why can't he just stop?
Why can't he understand that he's hurt me so much and I just want it to go away.

I want to be happy.
I don't care if that's what a selfish child wants.
That's what I want.

Why am I moving back....
Why did I move here in the first place?
I'm pretty torn.
In half.
I usually follow my heart. 
But my heart has been broken in both places.
And now I feel like it's in Texas.
What do you do when you don't know what your heart is saying?
I need to do what would make me happy.
But my heart won't be happy, ever.
So why am I doing this?
I feel like I make rash decisions and then always regret them.

Chris was asking Holly about me and asked for my number.
I don't think she gave it to him.
I'm nervous.
I talked to Mike today through text messages for over an hour.
We should have just called each other.
Chris moved to Boston, so I have less of a chance of seeing him.
Most of me knows that is good.
Some of me still wants to see him.
I'm not over it.
Shawn and I fooled around today.
It's fun, but I feel bad after.
Not that I like Brittany anyway.
But still. I know what it's like.
I'm moving back in 8 days.
I'm pretty excited.
Kyle IMed me today and I'm sad because I was on away message.
I mailed a lot of stuff today including college stuff.
And I bought boxes and packed.
And I wrote an extraordinary college essay.
Well at least, I'm proud.
I told Steve that I would hang out with him today.
But when he called I was with Shawn.
I don't want to lead him on.
So I didn't answer.
Is that wrong?
Shawn wanted to answer it and tell him that I was busy with him.
I said that was mean.
I went to work today to buy my dad a birthday present.
But I couldn't find anything.
I'm sad to leave work.
I got a 90 on my final paper for government.
I'd say that was pretty good.
I miss him.
I'm going to miss Shawn.
And that's bad.
I refuse to cry.
But I know I will.
I did laundry today. 
Tomorrow is my last day of school in the OC.
Next week I have finals.
Not all that excited.
On Sunday, we're having a work party and it's at a bowling alley.
I'm wicked excited.
I asked someone where the elastics were the other day and they had no idea what I was talking about.
After two hours, I found one and said ""this!"" and he said ""you mean rubber bands?"".
I felt stupid.
But I'm going to continue to call them elastics.
I'm trying to go on a diet cause I gained weight.
But I like fast food to much.
And coke.
I need to not smoke weed ever again.
Jennifer gave me a hot pink purse today and I love it.
Seeing as how I wear pink everyday.
I started watching the new show, Point Pleasant.
I liked it a lot but I missed tonights episode.
I watched American Idol.
There's no way some people actually think they can sing.
I guess this is all.
I have nothing more to say tonight.

I hate boys.
I hate school.
I hate having to do stuff.

My doctors think I have cervical cancer.
Caused by a lack of treatment to something Chris gave me.
Thank you Chris Brogna.
I greatly appreciate everything you have given to me. 
Which basically only includes sickness, and a pack of altoids.
Kinda ironic.

"event","What am I doing? I have no idea. I know that last night at 1 in the morning, Shawn called me because I was the only person he wanted to talk to. What does that mean? If anything? Does it mean that he needed to talk to me, because he can't sleep without hearing my voice? Or that, I was the only person he knew would listen to him bitch about his day, or is it just something that you say to someone, when you wake them up so that they feel as though it was worth waking up for? I don't know. I'm confused. And we talked for like an hour. And I told him my problems, and although there's no way for him to understand what I'm going through at least he tried and asked questions. And it was a good coversation, that allowed me to go back to sleep after. There were no unanswered questions, or awkward moments of silence, or questionable statements. It was just a conversation. But why did it have to happen at 1 in the morning? He told me that he really doesn't want me to leave, and that he thinks about it all the time. But does he really? Or is it just something someone says to someone when they don't know how to respond? He asked me what he was going to do in school without me because he ""has no other friends"". Even though the whole school loves him and he knows everyone, he just chose, I guess, to hang around with me for the past 5 months. And what does that mean? Is it just something someone does for a new person in school to spend all their time with that one person? Or does it mean that he actually cares about me? Which brings me back to the fact that he can't care about me very much. When you care about someone, you don't ignore them infront of certain people just to avoid conflict. Or do you? Is that a normal thing, that I just don't know about? Is it right for a boy to ignore girls in front of his girlfriend? I don't think so. We were supposed to hang out after school, but Brittany wanted to see him before work. He lied to her continiously. First saying, he was to tired and wanted to sleep before work at 3. And then changing, to well I have to meet my mom for lunch so I can't. And in the end, he went to see her anyway, because he could tell she didn't believe him. Why? Why would he put himself in the position where he has to lie to her? Maybe I do matter to him. You don't lie about things, that you don't mind losing. Or do you? And if you lie all the time, what kind of relationship is that anyway? He said ""is that bad that I just lied to her"" and I said yes. And he said ""am I over it?"" and I said of course you are. Either he doesn't care that he's lying to her, or he hides it well. But either way, without honesty there isn't a relationship to save. He told me that the reason he's not with me is because I'm moving and he doesn't want to be alone. But it's not right to stay with someone, just because you can't be by yourself. In the end, you're hurting her. And he's hurting me now. I don't expect him, to be with me. Deep down, I never did. And I never will. It wouldn't work out. But why? I probably know. BUt I think we would have a lot of fun. I look around school, at other couples and wonder why I don't have a boyfriend. Either I spend entirely too much time around guys that would never date me, or something is wrong with me. Because I look at other girls, and not to talk ish, but personally I think I have a lot more going for me. I mean, I match my clothes, and I brush my hair, and I'm sociable. Most of the time. And yet, I'm not the one with a boyfriend. Not to say I necessarily want one. But I would like to know that I could actually keep a relationship with someone who is normal and not a sociopath. And I comment to Shawn about ""why don't I have a boyfriend"" and he says you could have any guy if you actually put effort into hanging out with people. And I think to myself. I DO. I put a lot of time and effort into you. And it got me no where. Which is pretty much where I get with all guys. I either, can't make myself attracted to the good ones, and I fall to hard for the bad ones. And either way I'm alone. Which is okay, because I have friends. Some of the best people in the world, who will pick me up when I fall, and deal with my insane drama and attitude and stay behind me even when they know I'm wrong. And in the end, those are the people that are going to be around. And I'm not going to remember some guy that I was obsessed with for a week. Or will I? The mind is an odd thing. Sometimes I wish I could record what I'm thinking and play it back. On a side note, I hope <b>he's</b> very happy. And I hope she and him work things out and I hope they have a wonderful relationship together. And I hope they both know that I was hurt in the process. And I hope every one else knows, that they added to it.

What is also crazy is that this morning there were tornado watches, and this afternoon there were flood warnings. Which are all normal things, but not here. Everything floods when it rains. And there are so many deaths because of flooding, and mudslides. There's so much rain, and they're not built for it. There's like 3 inches of water as you're cruising down the street. I've never seen anything like this before. Malibu and Bel-air schools were closed today because of flooding. That's insane. And I fucking hate when there's an inch of rain, but somehow, your pants get wet up to your knees?

Most likely because I know it's not over. It's never over. That would be to good to be true. So I guess I'm just waiting for someone to say ""Yah.. just kidding"".

My mom doesn't want me to move home. How ironic. For so long she had been asking me to come home and when I finally decide too, she's like ""it's easier when you're there""... She's mad about it. She's already telling me rules, and the way it's gonna work out. Telling me things I can and cannot do. We used to be really close, but now it almost seems like she's pushing me away. Anytime I try to tell her about my day, she asks so many annoying questions that aren't even related. Or she'll judge me by what I tell her. Anytime I start to talk about anything, the only thing she says is ""did you get homework"" and for a while I would say yes. But then she would piss me off too no end asking me whether or not I did it. And if I actually open up and tell her what the homework is, she bothers me about it for a week. When I tell her I have a project, the only thing she talks about until the project is due is the project. Every conversation I have with her, ends badly because she makes me so mad with her stupid questions. And she's always like why are you in such a bad mood? But I'm not. When I see that she's calling I get in a mad mood. Usually I just ignore the calls until I can't take the ringing anymore. I hate when people ask me questions, just to ask questions. Just so there is something to talk about. I don't want to stay on the phone for an hour, repeating ""so what did you do today?"". Especially not with my mom. It annoys me so much. And then most of the time, she doesn't even listen to my answer. So then we just had a meaningless conversation and still she has no idea what's going on in my life. And everyone says, well she's your mom she's supposed to be like that. But I don't think that's true. We got along fine, til she started acting like a mom. When I was little, she acted like my friend. And suddenly I became a junior in high school, and she realized ""I have to act like a mom"", but now that I'm a senior I think she took it a little to far. I fucking hate it. 

And to sit there and tell me that her life is easier when I'm here, because she doesn't have to deal with ""it all"". What? Deal with what? I don't understand.

I think that you meet every person for a reason. And I know that everyone leaves an affect on me. They change me, or my views in some way. They influence me, and make me smile or laugh, or cry or they make me completely angry. But I know it's all for a reason.

And there's people here, that I want to stay close with. But I don't know how. It's not like it's an hour away so we can plan weekend trips. It's a 6 hour flight which most people don't want to take. And there's a number of people here, that have been so completely nice to me and I wish I could take them with me. And I never want to forget them. Or them to forget me. And I don't know how to stay in contact with them.

My cousin Jamie has lived in about 14 places. And he still has friends in all of them, that he talks to regularly. That's how I want it to be. My problem is I don't know if these people feel the same way. I mean, maybe I didn't affect them at all, and didn't leave any type of impact on their life. And that makes me really sad to think, that someone could just forget me. 

But I look at everything that's going on in the world, and realize I'm kind of nothing in whole thing. I mean there are things far more important going on, then wondering whether or not a few seniors in highschool will remember me, in 5 years. But I hope they do. 

There's probably 10 people. Here, that I just really enjoy being around. 
Christina, because she was the first girl who reached out to me and introduced me to her friends and just really made me feel welcome. 
Shawn, because he was the first friend I had here. The first one that I hung out with.
Jennifer, because she is also one of the first people who reached out to me and is just that insane, fun person. 
Curtis, because he's always been nice to me and we have a lot of fun hanging out with each other.
Steve, because he's been really nice to me, and he's just that really nice guy that you wish you could like romanticly but it will never happen.. 
Holly, because she's one of the funniest people I've ever met and she's the total opposite of everything Orange County.
John, because he is crazy and fun to be around and protects me from Andrew.
Matt, because he is always nice to me and can make me laugh even when I'm sad. And because all he wants is to hang out with me, and I say no everyday and it's kinda become routine.
Juan, because he is obsessed with why I moved here, and because he's the funniest drunk person ever. And we have tons of fun together.
Cj, because he's the cutest boy I've ever known.

Those are the people I'll forever remember. I know it. And I hate that I won't be able to see them everyday. That's so weird. It's so weird, that in 5 months, I met 10 people, that I wish would follow me around, because they're great. 

I still don't know how I'm going to tell Shawn. I'm sad about this. And I might go to college here. If I get into Long Beach state, I'm probably going to go. And he's going to school around there. But I can't expect him to stick around for me. He has a girlfriend. But maybe if we're meant to be, we will be. I'm a strong believer that I should follow my heart. That's why I've done everything, that way I've done it so far. This decision in the first one, ever, that I'm going against my heart. My heart is telling me to stay. But my mind tells me to go. And I want to go. But my heart is torn, half because I'll miss him, and half because I know it's stupid to even think I stand a chance when he has a girlfriend. It sucks.

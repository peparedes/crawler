It would be a mix between Big Brother and the film ""Cube"". I liked the first time I saw those whistar specie of humans on tv -Skinner should've been proud- but something was missing there beyond the sentimental pornography, a real meaning for the group... 

I really don't like the reality shows or TV, I really can live without it :), but everytime someone mentions the subject i like to tell them my idea... :)

does your family love you, does the White Clown love you??

Today is the saddest day of my life,

I have lost a very good friend.

A kindred spirit has gone... a part of my heart is gone too. hope to find soon -in this grief- the heal for my pain and sorrow.

It is a mourning day and time for me."

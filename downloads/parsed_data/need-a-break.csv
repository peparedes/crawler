"event","So yesterday I got into my first car accident, well I wasnt driving, so its not exactly my accident. anywyas, derek was making a left turn from yonge to aylmer in rosedale on a yellow, and he was accelerating just so he could get through, but the guy going straight on yonge was also accelerating to try to get through, and we hit... both the front of the cars were wreaked, and the other guy's airbag deployed, but ours didnt. so yah, interesting day... police, ambulance, and firetruck came... pour sand over the liquid on the ground which i think its just windshield fluid. came rather close."

"event","Love is an accident... waiting to happen.
Desire is a stranger... you think you know.
Intimacy is a lie... we tell ourselves.
Truth is a game... we play to win. 

If you believe in love at first sight... you never stop looking."

anyways, just went out wit paul n chan. we walked into a construciton site, n went up to teh second floor. i was sorta hoping they'd smoke, but they didn't, n meh. I would have gone all the way to the roof if i hadn't known it was only 6 stories. n i'd probably went up onto the crane! :) but hell it was boring up there. no tools, no wut so ever. i was hoping there'd be a chainsaw! so we came bak down, n decide to go into the cemetory to smoke. but that place freaked them out. they were like ""dont go there, graves are all over the ground"" hell! its a cememtry. anyways, they were way too freaked out to smoke, so out we came, n ended up in a park, where we just talked bout life... how interesting...

"event","You don't always have to fuck her hard. 
In fact sometimes that's not right... to do 
Sometimes you've got to make some love and fucking give her some smoochies too. 

Sometimes you've got to squeeze. 
Sometimes you've got to say please. 
Sometimes you've got to say hey,I'm gonna fuck you softly. 
I'm gonna screw you gently. 
I'm gonna hump you, sweetly. 
I'm gonna bar you discreetly. 

And then you say hey I brought you flowers and then you say, wait a minute Sally. I think I got something in my teeth, could you get it out for me? That's fucking teamwork. 

What's your favorite posish(position)? That's cool with me, it's not my favorite but I'll do it for you. What's your favorite dish? I'm not gonna cook it, but I'll order it from Zanzibar. 

And then I'm gonna love you completely. 
And then I'll fucking fuck you discreetly. 
And then I'll fucking bone you completely and then, 

I'm gonna fuck you hard. 

Hard."

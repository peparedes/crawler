Following&nbsp;<lj user=""archanglrobriel"" />&#39;s example...

A few years back <lj user=""d2leddy"" />&nbsp;wrote an interesting and challenging post on why it was a bad idea to use the military for humanitarian missions and/or general &quot;policing&quot; in places America has a military presence, with the exception of singular, short term emergency disaster situations. His point, as I recall, was that in the most base of descriptions the purpose of the military is to kill people and to continue to do so (strategically), until the military&#39;s goal, whatever that might be, is met. Assigning a group of people trained essentially to kill on demand to instead rescue and police blunted their ability to meet their primary objective if it continued for an extended period of time. Essentially, it forces those soldiers to see people as people, or worse as victims, rather than as targets or enemies - even if you aren&#39;t talking about the same group of people - and that, in turn, makes it harder to kill them on command.&nbsp;<br>
</div><div>I wish I could recall if this was in the Clintonian Yugoslavia/Rwanda/Somalia era or in the early years of the Iraq occupation, just to make it easier to find the post, because it was brilliant. And, after reflecting on it for a bit, I ended up reluctantly agreeing with him. Using the military for non-military functions - and I think we can all agree that standard police work, even in high-tension situations, isn&#39;t a military function - is detrimental to military standards and purpose.&nbsp;<br>
</div><div>What I&#39;m seeing with regard to the Occupy movement, east and west coast, is the equal and opposite case study, the militarization of the police. And I find it equally damaging to the purpose of the organization. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have boasted about the military capacity and capability of the NYPD - WTF? The Oakland police, and apparently even the <i>campus</i>&nbsp;police at Davis are armed with not only the standard &quot;billy club&quot; but with truly military weaponry that a decade ago would have been limited to SWAT teams in urban areas with huge hours of specialized training. With this change we get the opposite of what we want, need, and expect from the police.

Reflecting, I suppose that minorities, especially those in urban areas have known this for a long time and <a href=""http://reason.com/blog/2011/11/17/occupy-wall-street-response-suddenly-cau"">it&#39;s only a revelation for some of us more sheltered folk.</a>

For me it&#39;s been a matter of generally believing it to be a matter of isolated incidents and bad apples.&nbsp;In a short bit of research this morning I was appalled by what I found. What amounts to police departments being given near to carte-blanche access to military surplus, and then developing &#39;we have to use it to make the investment worth it&#39; attitudes. WTF?&nbsp;

<a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/164501/paramilitary-policing-seattle-occupy-wall-street"">Norm Stamper, Chief of Police in Seattle during the 1999 World Trade Organization riots, on UC Davis events</a>
&quot;More than a decade later, the police response to the Occupy movement, most disturbingly visible in Oakland&mdash;where scenes resembled a war zone and where a marine remains in serious condition from a police projectile&mdash;brings into sharp relief the acute and chronic problems of American law enforcement. Seattle might have served as a cautionary tale, but instead, US police forces have become increasingly militarized, and it&rsquo;s showing in cities everywhere: the NYPD &ldquo;white shirt&rdquo; coating innocent people with pepper spray, the arrests of two student journalists at Occupy Atlanta, the declaration of public property as off-limits and the arrests of protesters for &ldquo;trespassing.&rdquo;....The paramilitary bureaucracy and the culture it engenders&mdash;a black-and-white world in which police unions serve above all to protect the brotherhood&mdash;is worse today than it was in the 1990s. Such agencies inevitably view protesters as the enemy. And young people, poor people and people of color will forever experience the institution as an abusive, militaristic force&mdash;not just during demonstrations but every day, in neighborhoods across the country.&quot;

This is the article that, simply put, truly shocked me. He lists the military equipment now owned&nbsp;<i>and used</i> by numerous small town police departments.&nbsp;
&quot; [the] Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Act, which allowed and encouraged the military to give local, state, and federal police access to military bases, research, and equipment. It authorized the military to train civilian police officers to use the newly available equipment, instructed the military to share drug-war&ndash;related information with civilian police and authorized the military to take an active role in preventing drugs from entering the country.&quot;

I learned from clicking the embedded link to the Boston Globe article mentioned that a separate law passed in 1994 requires that distributed weapons&nbsp;<i>must be used within a year</i> or returned to the military. Wow, what a way to incentivize over the top responses. The Globe article is well worth a click.&nbsp;

"event","Prompted by a number of things...

1. Why is it the far right is all about local control until a particular locality (i.e. NYC) is okay with something they can leverage to promote fear? 

2. From the ""Those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it"" files: 

A. In 1755 thousands of Arcadians were given a choice, sign an oath of loyalty to the Crown or be expelled from Canada, Nova Scotia and New New Bruswick specifically. Those who refused to sign were ""transported"" to various places (including New England), primarily the totally unfamiliar place called Louisiana. Homes and crops were burned to the ground. Families were separated, husbands and wives, parents and children. Why? Because they were French Catholics and the British felt they were a religious and political threat. 

B. A few days late to be on the exact anniversary, but the reminder rings true. On August 12, 1834 the Ursuline Convent in Charlestown, MA was burned to the ground...The Irish (read Catholics) posed an economic threat as well as a religious one, as the Irish immigrants were perceived to be willing to work for less than the English immigrants and relatively newly minted ""Americans"". The conflict took on a political dimension when the Irish supported Andrew Jackson over Massachusetts' native son John Quincy Adams in the 1834 presidential election. Added to this was the fact that the convent was near ""sacred ground"", the site on which the Bunker Hill Monument was being built.To many Americans, the Ursuline compound nearby was a symbol of a foreign faith that was evil, hateful and a threat to the nation. This event in MA presaged anti-Catholic riots in Philadelphia, New York and other cities that persisted for the next decade.  

C. As recently as the 1960's there was a suspicion that Catholics were plotting to take over the country and turn it into a ""Papist"" state. 

D. Oh, let's not forget the whole ""internment camp"" episodes of the 1940s. While that was national/cultural more than religious, the comparison cannot be escaped. You are different so you are a threat. 

WTF America?!
In the months, and even years following 9/11 there wasn't this level of what has now been termed Islamophobia. Other than political expediency, what is your damage?"

"event","I admit it, I didn't like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in large part because I was (am?) very much like the older sister. Did what I was supposed to do, followed the rules, etc., and generally got irritated with people who didn't and got away with it, possibly because, yes, I was a bit jealous of both their disdain for the rules, and their ability to skirt / flaunt them. 

That being said, I think I may be the only person around who thinks the two big things on facebook / teh interwebs right now, the flight attendant who let loose on the passengers and the girl who quit her gig via picture post, are not great things that should be celebrated, but really examples of immaturity and irresponsibility. 

Were the people they were reacting to behaving badly? Yes. The one passenger clearly wasn't following directions and the boss was clearly a dick - if we are to believe the pretty one-sided version of events chronicled on-line. But in the grown-up world, returning bad behavior with bad behavior isn't generally celebrated. 

Do either of these people plan on working again? Ever? Because for all that they seem to be getting acclaim for their ""mad as hell not gonna take it"" moments, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't hire either one of them. It's not like they'll be able to hide these incidents in any future applications / interviews. And even if the flight attendant has 28 years in, I'm pretty sure he shot his pension all to hell. 

The Id...yes, we all have moments when we would love to give it free reign and damn the consequences. Generally speaking we don't - which is why we have movies like Ferris Bueller, so we can do it vicariously. Which may be why so many people are talking about how wonderful these two folks are, because it's vicarious to them. But really? <i>Really? </i>"

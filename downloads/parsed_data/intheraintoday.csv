"event","but <a href=""http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=intherain"">this</a> place is still fun.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v310/withoutanumbrella/DSC01198.jpg"">

see how acurately m and delaney demonstrate my skills at img src? 
they sure are fun subjects.

"event","an update. 

(oh livejournal, my poor neglected lover. 
oneday we shall sustain a steady relationship, 
but thatday is not today.) 

i merely post this morning to profess my undying affection for a few specificthings. farmingtonstyle. 
(and no, this will not be alphabetized, where's the whimsy in that?) 
this list is included but by no means limited to:

Ei's snowy hugs and latenight talks
m's knitting hand (and the way she holds her pencil) 
Gwen's eloquence (in writing and in speech)
Casey's phrase, ""and i really like it!"" 
Ken's closed eyes as he sings (and all of his music)
Josh's laugh (""Aha-ha!"")
Gary's orange snowsuit (and all the sillyness it holds) 
Clean's wit, and his samurai stealth
Breaze's sunburn
Kevin's longcoat and little hat 
Scott's sextalks and obscure movie references
Dan Winsor's voice (sometimes i think the words are falling over themselves, but they are all ok)
Kira's mouthful of spinich
Dan Sweetzer's food faces
Jack Woods's high fives
Delany's meandering (or is it lollygagging?)
Caleb's little kid voice (singing spiderman)


""and i want life in every word
to the extent that its absurd..."""

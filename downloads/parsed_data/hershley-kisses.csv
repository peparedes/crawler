"event","Yup havent updated in a while...the party was ok...
My braces come off this tuesday excited...got shoes for my graduation dress...nothing really excited...been very confused I should say...confused on my friends?
I don't know we got year books friday someone counted all the people who have signed my year book and it was 69 and half of them wrote more then once so it might be in the 70's for comments in it.
School is almost over...its kinda sad but, at the same time excited. I know all my friends will NOT keep in touch with me they will probably ditch me. so basically my summer will probably be with christa we already decided on that...but i have time for my other friensd too i wont be with christa 24/7 i just know that most of my friends will forget about my and probably ditch me they did that last year. but w/e

yup thats my update ill update later...

Leave a comment if you still read this damn thing. I might be done with it...for sure.yea

today wasnt nething new...except i didn't get a hug especially when i needed one...i was really sad today...some people know some dont...but that person didnt give me a hug which i really dont care if they do or not it is just the fact that i needed one but i got some from others...so i dont care that u didnt give me a hug or not it was just stupid of u to tell me u were and u didnt.

so im home its 8 and im still kind of sad. But not at the reason why i was when i was in school its all better now

but im still sad. for a different reason. i need to talk to justyna or something. becuase she is the only one who listens to me. well there are other people who do but she really listens to me and idk.

but whatever...right now im watching the laguna beach marathon.
and talking to a jerk

Because you're my Best Friend..(this was off a website i am not that good of a poet)

When you are sad,
I will dry your tears.
When you are scared,
I will comfort your fears.
When you are worried,
I will give you hope.
When you are confused,
I will help you cope.
And when you are lost,
And can't see the light.
I shall be your beacon
Shining ever so bright
This is my oath.
I pledge till the end.
Why you may ask?
Because your my friend.  

~****another poem from internet****~

you'r my friend and that is true,
but the gift was given from me to you.
we went thru moments that were good and bad,
even moments that were happy and sad.
you suported me when i was in tears,
we stuck together when we were in fear,

its really sad that it had to be this way,
but it has reached its very last day.
miles away cant keep us apart,
'cause you'll always be in my heart.


~****ok one more from the internet****~

My Friend

My Friend when I think of you.
I think of all that we've been through.
All the times we argue and fight,
I know deep inside that it isn't right.
I, then feel bad and alot of pain.
It feels like I've fallen from the sky like the rain.
I love you dear friend with all of my heart.
But now that you're gone I've fallen apart.
I'm getting better as the days go by.
I wish sometimes this was all a big lie.
I pray to you every night.
It's like you're my fire, a burning light. 
My dear friend, I miss you alot.
I still wonder why you were put in that spot.
I know you're in a place much better than here. 
Watching and helping me with all of my fear.
Our friendship my dear friend,
we will have to the end.
Friends til the end is what we will be.
Someday we'll be together,
together you and me.

Yea so I went to the mall with j-ko (Jess kogut) and i saw martine, ally, megan g and r, dan,mike veronica,julie,mia,maggie,janelle,jill,marissa,gabby,ashley,dave, and like more people...

I talked to Martine and Ally about alot that was happening...
Then the funniest moment of the night was at the 99 restaurant Mike spilt some salt from the salt shaker and the waitress comes over and goes throw it over your shoulder (not knowing she meant the salt that fell out of the shaker onto the table) so mike looks at the salt shaker shruggs his shoulders and tosses the salt shaker over his shoulder, It was the funniest thing ever...

yea so I am happy now...Everything is goin good my dad is home for easter yaya. 

Yea so today we went out to eat and that is about it...

"event","I really like this song and i am listening to it now so here are the lyrics.






Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why 

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

Chorus:
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why 

You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say 

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

But you'll just tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for 

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return 

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know"

"event","Sarah got stuck in a blizzard last night on her way back up to the U.P.  She had to stay the night at a hotel in Gaylord.  Now today the 2 major highways in the U.P. are closed which makes it a huge pain in the ass for her to get back home.  It pisses me off that they can't keep the 2 major highways clear up there.  If you dont have a 4 wheel drive you are basically screwed.  I just can't wait for it to be Spring of 09 so we will both be graduated and there will be no more trips to and from the U.P.  She is amazing and I hate worrying about her on those long trips.  Anyways, I just thought I would vent because I think the U.P. should be used to getting blizzard by now and have a way to fix it.  

Also, I hate snow days in college.  Everyone likes them the day of, but then professors assume that you will still work on your homework all day......riiiiiiiiight.  So now I'm even farther behind on my readings.  Hurray for getting in over my head!

Thats all for now."

"event","So I had my first interview today at Wolverine Human Services in Vassar.  The pioneer work and learn center is a boot camp for juvenile delinquints.  Its military like, with uniforms and marching.  

I will be starting out as a Buck Sergant.  This is as close to the military that I will ever get probably lol.  The kids will most likely be little dicks but oh well.  I will be starting at around $8.65/hr I believe.  If I have 60 credits it will be more but I don't think I have that many yet.  I have to shave off my chin fuzz :(

I have a bunch of paper work to do this weekend. 

Talk to ya all later

"event","Well everyone, I'm back online after a couple days of no cable internet.  It was hard for all of us but luckily we made it.  I am officially moved into the house and and every thing is going pretty good.  Now that we have cable I can pretty much continue my old ruetine.  The only thing thats different is that I'm going to the YMCA every day now and eating healthy.  I figured this would be the perfect time to change my life around for the better.  I must say it is a hell of a lot easier to eat healthy when you are buying your own food.  I have a limited cash flow being that I am unemployed so I have to try to save money.  This means there won't be fast food purchases.  Because the 5 bucks I would spend at a fast food place could by a loaf of bread and lunch meat which would last a lot longer.  The YMCA in owosso doesn't have a pool but it does have a steam room in sauna.  I enjoy sitting in these rooms and cleaning out the pores.  I'm hoping to be ""in shape"" by next fall.  For all you skinny people out there it might seem like a long time considering I'm working out daily and eating right but its really hard to lose large amounts of weight.  AFter all I'm not talking about 5-10 vanity pounds.  Well I'm sure I've bored you all long enough so I'm gonna get ready to go to the Y.  See ya soon!

"event","Last night the crew went to the machine shop and watched a couple bands that we knew.  It was pretty sweet, Second System was awesome.  It was too crazy for me seeing Myron Leslie there.  Frank went over and talked to him but I never got around to it.  I guess he was pretty wasted.  The fun came after we left the shop and went over to Brett's house because he had a keg and both bands we were watching at the machine shop came over.  They played a little bit on the equipment Brett has for Broken Down.  The whole experience was pretty trippy but it was very fun.  Tony also came which was cool because he had to work this morning early and he still came out and had a few brewskies.  I didn't make it to bed until about 4 this morning but I'm still feeling pretty good.  My morning afters are usually a nice relaxed feeling.  Well I had a bitchin time last night and I thought I would share it with you fine folks.

"event","Well the other day when I was out in my car I decided to roll down the windows to clean them off a little bit.  The Problem is that when I went to roll the window back up it wouldn't go.  It was stuck in the completely as far down as it gets position.  So we took my car to Oliver's Garage and had him check it out.  He just called me and told me that it needs a new window motor.  He mentioned that it is gonna be $150 for parts and labor.  The only thing worse than things breaking on your car is things breaking on your car right before you are trying to sell it.  Obviously I can't sell it if the window is stuck in the down position.  I might be able to get away with something like that in the summer time but definately not when its friggin 20 friggin degrees out.  The cool thing is that I can still drive the Caprice.  That car has 265K miles on it and it still has minimal problems **knock on wood**.  I will just drive that for now until I get the Grand Prix fixed.  There are things to be happy about though.  One thing is the fact that it is Friday.  I'm sure you all know what goes down on Fridays.  The Crew will make a move while we bust a groove while we in the club, show us some love.  Either that or we will just get crunked at someones house.  It will probably be that one.  New update on the crew website...all pictures are being put on a separate website to save bandwidth.  I will just put a link to the pictures on Crew website.  This will also allow me to have a lot more pictures for you all to view.  I am in the process of archiving all the old photoes I have and after that I will put up a new page for new photos.  Well I'm gonna hop in the shower so I'll talk to ya later.

Anyways, you people might just make me late for my math class at 6:00 but its the name of the game.  After class I'm gonna go pick up some balloons and party supplies for the party later.  I'll talk to ya all after class, well maybe not you all but at least a couple of you.

But before I go I have a question to ask you...

What are you gonna do when you get out of jail?"

The dorms were nice but the rules they have are a little too much like prison.  I am writing this entry in search of potential roommates that go to school or work in the Flint/Owosso or surrounding areas.  I am anxious to here from any of you that might be interested.  Talk to you all soon.

"event","Well today is Tuesday and its friggin rainin.  I was supposed to go snowmobiling this weekend for a guys weekend but its not lookin good at all.  The thing I hate the most is the solid ice, the reason is because yesterday when I was walking out to my car I fell on my azz and my OS concepts book fell in the mud.  If my dirty wet pants weren't enough, I had to damage the $80 book.  I can't believe this is the 6th week of school already.  With Baker only having 10 weeks of class, that means I'm starting to wind down the semester.  I think I have A's in both Math and English and a B+ in OS concepts.  Yesterday was valentines day and Jessie was my valentine :).  I hung out with Frank and Jessie the first have of the day and later on Me, Landon, and my parents went to the Pistons game and had lower lvl seats, it was very nice.  The pistons blew out the bucks by over 20 points and Darko had a season high.  It was a good game to go to.  The coolest part is they were 60 dollar seats and we got them from a season-ticket holder for free.  Well that, and gettin all buzzed up on the way down there.  Today I have Enlgish from 2-3:50 which sucks because I hate the class and I dont know whats due today.  I need to get my teeth all sparkling clean so I'll check back in with you fine folks later.

Anyways, today was great because I dropped my Networking Essentials class and it will not effect my GPA.  Also I talked with the head of the Education department and she gave me some materials to look over.  Because if you haven't heard the latest headlines, TPayne is gonna be a teacher...(This is the part wear you roll on the ground laughing uncontrolably).  What made Tyler decide to be a teacher you may ask?  Short answer: Its in the blood.  I don't want to ramble on to much about me going into Teaching (going to Major in Computer Science and Minor in History).  There is nothing easy about the teaching profession but I was attracted by the vacation time.  So whats new with me...haven't updated this shiznizzle in awhile.  Oh yeah, I know what to talk about, The STUPID BOWL.  I mean Super Bowl.  Is anyone having a bowl party?  IF you are, don't be too shy to send an invite over this way.  I watched a few episodes of Celebrity Fit Club and got attached.  Being a fat person myself, I instantly liked seeing famous people struggle with trying to lose weight.  I am currently trying to lose weight as well but I swear my frickin metabolism is as slow as a snail.  Its not all genetics fault, I need to get out and exercise more.  I could probably have a six pack in a week if I spent the amount of time in the gym that I spend playing EQ2 or messing around on the computer.  One thing that is good to have though is a workout partner, its always funner that way.  If you are intersted post on here.  I currently have a YMCA membership in saginaw but I will be transferring it to Owosso when I move out that way.  Well I have an Intermediate Algebra Class from 6-9:40 so I guess I'll be going now.  Talk to you all sooner or later.  Hopefully sooner.

May I be one of the firsts to say they did an excellent job in putting their full efforts in restoring everyone's data.  I appreciate the livejournal staff and the awesome fact that this is free.  With that said, I had a pretty boring weekend.  Nobody called me to hang out or anything.  I did go with Frank to Saginaw and thats about it.  People must be tired of me again.  Oh well.  I got my homework done for Monday so Monday should be stress free for me yippee.  Make sure you all check out the crew website, we have a new member.  I won't spoil it for you, you can check it out for yourself.  I'll put a link at the bottom of this page.  I have been trying to update the site but I think I need to put in a little more effort.

"event","So yeah, my fat ass started my diet/exercise program yesterday.  My diet isn't really conventional, its mainly dividing everything I used to eat in half.  The exercise part is the bitch of it.  The ironic thing is I actually like the feeling I get after the work out but while I'm doing the work out I feel dead.  Anyways, I dont know how much you all know about Pilates but like 2 years ago I got my mom a pilates dvd (covered in dust by now).  So I thought i would bust it out.  I tell you what, ladies and gents, this shit is rough, and I'm the exercise tape master.  Richard Simmons, Tae-bo, Step Block...that stuff all seems like a piece of cake after pilates.  Ya see, Pilates concentrates on having your ""core"" tight during every exercise you do.  Your core is basically your abs and we all know, well maybe not all of us, but most of us know the ab pain after a long ab workout.  So with all that said, do I have any volunteers to be a Pilates partner.  Actually, nevermind, I'm not sure I want anyone watching me try to put my legs straight up in the air and touch them with my hands.

My first week of school went suprisingly well.  Actually, I have no complaints.  My biggest suprise was my math class.  Math class sucks, we all know that.  But this teacher seems pretty good, by good I mean she gets down on the teaching thing and she does it well.  Also, we all know that Math classes come with lots of homework.  Not with her, or at least it dont seem like it.  As for my other classes, my English class is pretty good, I mean my teacher is a ding bat but the actual class don't seem that hard.  And for my CIS (Computer Information Systems) classes, they look to be difficult but they also seem to be very informational and good for my career future.  Plus its a bonus to enjoy learning.

I have something to bitch about now.  I went to the Genesee Valley Mall yesterday in between classes and I got some Subway (goes good with the whole diet thing).  Now I'm not sure if the mall's prices are jacked up or subway in general raised their prices but for a 12"" meal it was $8.50.  So I was like, ok, I'll pay it today and just pack a lunch from now on, I wasn't too pissed.  But right before I left I went for a refill on my diet pepsi and the BITCH behind the counter was like ""you know its 50 cents for a refill"".  And I was all like, ""Are you serious?"" and she said, ""read the sign"".  Sure as shit there was a sign on the pop machine, 50 cent refills.  That just chapped my ass because I know they just raped me to begin with on the price, now they want another 50 cents for a 10 cent refill (If you were wondering, 20 oz cups cost 10 cents to fill with fountain machines).  Well I think I'm done bitching for now, but I'm gonna put it on you now, I want to hear what you have to bitch about.  Leave a comment with one of your complaints, tell your friends about it.  I want to get lots of complaints on here.

"event","Well hello faithful followers of Burt legend.  Just kidding.  Its been awhile I know but I'm starting to not be so apathetic lately.  Started school this week and its just some good clean fun.  My CIS classes seem like they will be the most informational and helpful toward my degree.  And since its a class for a dorky degree there aren't any hot chicks that distract me.  Thats the one bad thing about going into computer science, 90 percent of the people in the program are dudes, and the other 10 percent look like dudes.  Just kidding, they aren't all that bad.  The best program for picking up chicks would be the nursing program, which I heard Jason Jones is in, lucky bastard.  Anyways, here's how my schedule looks (as if any of you actually cared).  Monday- Operating Systems Concepts (6:00-9:40 P.M.) ; Tuesday- Composition II (2:00-3:50) and Essentials of Networking (6:00-9:40 P.M.) ; Wednesday - NO CLASS :) ; Thursday- Composition II (2:00-3:50) and Intermediate Algebra (6:00-9:40 P.M.).  That raps up my class schedule.  I bet by now you are wondering, he takes pretty much all night classes so he must have a job.  Well you would be right if I wouldn't have gotten laid off last month.  Fortunately I am collecting unemployment which isn't bad.  I don't make as good of money but considering I dont work for it, its pretty nice.  So basically I sleep in late and go to class late.  My mom calls me a hampster.  Anyways, I'll update this thing later, I gotta hop in the shower and get ready for class.

I figured, I might as well have a few drinks before the crew gets here.  I had a half a fifth of BV left so I said fuck it and started taking double shots.  I guess I had 4 of them before the crew made it over.  By the time the crew showed up I was pretty well on my way.  We went outside for the bonfire.  Landon, Rick and Frank split a 30 pack.  Rick had this great idea to start burning his clothes and he threw his shirt on the fire.  So I decided I would join in and through my Metallica shirt in the fire (This I really regret today).  Except I kept throwing my clothes in the fire and soon enough I was buck ass naked.  I dont remember many details of last night but I'm pretty sure I was fucked up."

I came to the conclusion that my earlobes are shrinking.  Now if you have known me for awhile, you know my earlobes are abnormally large.  I don't know why they are normalizing but I do not like it.  Enough about the earlobes, I'm sure you have better things to think about than my earlobes.  Since I took my friday off yesterday, I think I might just have a tiny little paycheck coming up next time.  I'm thinking about changing my room around a little bit, I'm gettin a little tired of the way it looks.  Another thing is, my shoes are disgusting, for some reason my shoes have contracted leoparacy.  I think I will lay them to rest soon.  I'm thinking of a card, I'm gonna try to draw it from the middle of the deck.  The card that is coming into my head right now is the 6 of clubs.  Lets see if I'm a magic dude...Shiz, its the 5 of diamonds.  I've been practicing that little mind telepathic stuff for awhile but I just can't seem to get the feel of it.  I caught a horsefly the other day and I kept him as a POW for awhile until I realized that was the same darn bug that bit me the other day.  Then I decided to get my molevolence on that jerk.  Needless to say, he is no longer with us.  I drank a 2-liter of cola tonight, I can't sleep at all and stuff.  Yo dawg, why you trippin and stuff. Hula dancers are always frontin, they make you think like they are good at it but when you look at them they are just hula hooping without the hula hoop.  Thats a big crock uv pooboojuices.  I feel bad for this journal.  It started out happy, and it made sense once or twice.  Now I am not sure if its all that sane.  Is it the journal, or the journalist.  I think its the journalist, I'm friggin outta my friggin mind.  I love you all, except you one person who knows who I am talking about you when I say except you.  Anywho, its about time we start to make sense so you all can take more accurate notes.  Sleep deprivation is not a disease but it is a condition.  I hung my rose up from prom and it is still up on my wall.  I just noticed it.  By god, I had forgotten all about it.  Thats funny, why would I notice it right now.  Thats friggin hilarious.  I was shooting my 12 guage shotgun today and it kicked my ass.  I put up a good fight with the 2 3/4 inch slugs but the 3 inch slugs just whupped my assss.  Me and Frank went to the mall today.  If you are wondering what mall we went to, I'll tell you now.  We went to the Genessee Valley Mall.  Although we didn't buy purchased merchandise from stores in the mall area, we did get to see some hot chicks.  The chicks were hot but they all seemed to be with a black guy.  Next time I will wear my P Miller outfit so I can be a thug.  maybe they will like my brand new fubu jacket, I got it for lots of G's on the ebay.  The stock market is cool because it is like monopoly but it is real and stuff.  Yeah, money is cool, it buys all the stufff you want to use or even do stuff with the stuff.  Property cool too, because you can own it and live on it and stuff.  I dont see why we have to buy property from people, who started with the property, someone got that shit for free. I think I might just pick me up some acre property stuff so i can put up a tent there and live there with some people.  my afro will come in handy for we have no pillow upstairs.  the only problem is what will we wear when the clothes get dirty.  nobody knows how to do laundry on the property that i will want to own with my own ownership.  my favorite rapper is eminem because he made it out da hood and made him life for him self.  he a true g unit homie.  yeah I know, I'm down with the hood g.  sometimes i wonder why I even update this at all, you aren't even listening.

Defeating all odds, the Detroit Pistons became the Eastern Conference Champs for the first time since 1990.  I'm so happy to have been able to watch it first hand.  It was so awesome.  I watched the game at Cinema Hollywood.  The crowd was filled with true fans and their hearts were in the game.  Mike S (cinema hollywood usher) tried to ruin everyones fun by making us sit down but it just made us more fired up.  This game was the best ever and I can't wait for the Finals.

Time to look for Finals tickets.  I had a dentist appointment today...no cavities :) and I'm going to Baker at 3:30 to check out the Dorm situation.  I'm having a great day.  Talk to you all later."

"event","Well people, its SatADay finally.  Oh wait, weekends aren't a big deal anymore since I have every day off.  Actually, boredom comes pretty quick when school is over.  Get this, I am actually happy that I have to work today.  It will give me something to do, even if it is sweaping up popcorn.  The pistons game is on tonight and I am a little nervous but its all good because whatever does happen, there are more games.  I'm about 90% sure that the game will be on at Cinema Hollywood and thats where I'm gonna watch it.  Ya'll should come up for it.  It will be off the hoooooooook.  Anyways, I gotta get ready for work.  L8R Kidz...

"event","First off, I appologize for not keeping this updated.  Sorry about that, I'll do a better job of this over summer so ya'll can know what I'm up to.  Well, a lot has been happening so lets catch ya'll up.  This week was my last week my Birch Run education.  I have to say that the number of good memories way outnumber the bad and I'm glad I got to grow up with all you people.  Of course mixed feelings are running through my blood.  I'm gonna miss everyone but I'm glad to finally be done with Grade School.  Now off to college.  Today I went to the Class of 1964 Scholarship Foundation's Fundraiser.  It was a great night.  Above all else, the $2,000 scholarship is amazing and that combined with other things makes my first year at Baker paid for.  But I also got some nice Sampsonite luggage and a pretty cool Bose sterio.  And to top off the night the Pistons absolutely slaughtered the Nets.  If ya'll didn't know, I'm a huge pistons fan.  So I'm in a great mood right now.  This week is gonna be absolutely nuts, Wednesday we all have practice and luncheon.  And of course Thursday is graduation.  After this week, I'm OFFICIALLY on summer break.  After this week I'm pretty much just on a work schedule and my work schedule is going to be very easy (getting most of my hours on weekends).  So I'll still have plenty of time to have fun.  I'm trying to get Frank to dorm with me down at Baker but he is making excuses.  If you see him, make sure you get at him and tell him to dorm with me.  Also today I put together a very general plot for a summer movie.  You can be looking for that movie on www.triggerstreet.com this fall.  Its called ""Molevolence""!  I'm pretty excited about that.  Other than that, not much is really new.  But I will be updating much more frequently so dont worry about it.  Oh yeah, My graduation party is on JUNE 19th.  More details on that later.  Well, I'm gonna get some shut-eye.

"event","Happy humpday everyone, hope you all had a great humpday.  Humpdays are my favorite holidays because they give you something to party about once a week.  We (Me, Frank, Landon, Chris) had ourselves a little bonfire in the back and drank some nice and cold Mike's.  Everything is going good, Frank had to leave at 11:00 though for some reason.  Landon and Chris just left to go to Taco Bell so it gave me a chance to check in with you, my fans.  If you guys were wondering what happened today you are in luck because I am the kind of guy that will tell my fans those type of things.  Today I went to Halo Burger for lunch and it sucked big ol floppy donkey dick.  Yeah, the food really sucked and it was expensive.  At least I learned a lesson to never eat there again.  I went to a movie after school with Frank, we saw ""The Whole 10 Yards""...this also sucked.  Dont go to this movie if you hate crappy movies.  Finally tonight my big paps builts us a bonfire and we sat around and enjoyed some beverages and continued to engage in intellegent night life conversations.  Good times.  Well Friends, I am out.  Have a great night and sweet dreamz kids.

"event","Whats with Mondays anyways.  They are really rough, its hard to wake up, its hard to function.  But anyways, not much is new.  Had a great weekend with Frank Tank, L-Train, and Rick.  Partied it up with them on Friday out in B-Port had some good times.  Besides that, nothing has been goin on.  I purchased a book to study my A+ and I'm gonna work hard on it so I can pass the exam.  That way I can get a job that pays what I'm worth, lol.  I've been trying to get this emulator called ""MAME"" to work on my computer but its been giving me a hard time.  I'm about to just give up and put it on my xbox after I put in a mod chip.  Anyways, enough with the boring shit.  Prom is coming up pretty fast so I'm gonna have to save up some cash cuz we (Me and Kylie) are riding with some other people in a limo bus.  I heard today that they will have a breathalizor at PROM so everyone wait til afterwords to drink so nobody gets fucked with an MIP.  Just another way BRHS can try to ruin everyone's fun.  I'm sorry I have such a boring life so you guys dont have anything cool to read lol.  I made the game-winning two pointer today in Gym class, what what.  Hrmmm, whatelse...oh yeah...I'm done.  Talk to ya'll later.  Peace kids.

"event","Whats up people, happy 420!  Anyways, today was just another day another dollar.  Well, 20 dollars, Yup I gave blood plasma today.  I give blood plasma every Tuesday and Thursday.  Its $20 the first time in the week and $25 the second time.  I mean, its only $45 a week but its better than nothin.  Gives me a little spending money for the weekends anyways.  I got a call from Bronner's today and they want me to come back in June to work at West Checkout.  I am definately going to go back to Bronner's then, but for now I will work at the theatre.  Who knows, maybe I will be able to work at both (<---doubt it).  The cool thing is that I will get a 25 cent raise and I will work there for at least 6 months with means...Unemployment baby, what what.  Gonna buy my prom tickets tomorrow.  My mom was nice enough to write me a check.  I was so pissed when I got home and checked out NBA.com and found out that the Pacer game is not being Nationally Televised.  I was like, what the fuck, like you are gonna have the Knicks/Nets game on over the pacers, what a bunch of fucking dumbasses.  Oh well, at least the Pistons will be on tomorrow.  The Real World is new tonight, which is cool.  Jesus I hate Frankie and Robyn, hopefully they kill eachother.  Besides that, not much going on.  I'll see ya all tomorrow.  Later kids."

"event","I would actually create one of these journals?  I sure wouldn't have pictured myself making one of these things but I guess I just spend so much time online, I figured what the hell.  So anyways, I guess this is where you will find out every little detail about my life (bet your hitting the back button right about now).  So whats new with me?  I recently got a job at Cinema Hollywood as an usher.  The job has crappy pay but you get free movies, popcorn, and pop so that makes up for the $5.50 an hour.  I'll have to see what kind of hours I get when summer starts and if I don't get that many, I will go back to Bronners to work.  Back to school today, real fun, had to wake up at 8:00 which is really early for me when the whole break I was going to bed at like 4:00 am.  Pistons won their first game i the playoffs.  In fact, they beat the bucks so bad that Milicic got in for a few minutes.  This made me very happy and I've been happy ever since.  For some reason I am emotionally attached to the Pistons and when they win I glow and when they lose, I'm just in a really bad mood.  Kinda weird?  Well, I'm out kids.  Bye!"

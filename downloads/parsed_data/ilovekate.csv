"event","<center><i>Her words penetrate the four corners
My body, My mind, My heart and soul
Over the trenches with ease she moves
Carefully constructed defences
Overwhelmed with a smile

Castle walls within my subconcious
Impenatrable to invaders
Of all races ages types and castes
Tall as a mountain, sturdy as stone
They crumble with a kiss

My body a piece of hardest steel
Conditioned to endure harsh treatment
Beaten and heated into a shape
Able to resist every extreme
Turns jelly with a touch

My heart the dryest barren desert
Both heat and wind continue the drought
Miles around, nothing to be seen
An ugly place devoid of all life
Is flooded with a word

My soul tucked away in its hiding
Not seeing the light of day for years
In this reality, its not found
Stuck in a place completely absent
Uncovered with a glance

Clever plans and protective actions
Steps taken to ensure my safety
Strategies put into place to absolve
All one could do to defend himself
Obsolete with a love

"event","""Man is an animal and that in the bitter struggle for existence all animals are shameless egoists by sheer necessity. At bottom, they are all SOLITARY and SELFISH. To the extent that humans act sociably and on occasion even unselfishly - i.e. mating, rearing children, living and work with each others - they have learned to do so in order to satisfy some self-centred motive such as lust or hunger.""



 (Thomas, Hobbes 1679) 






 I am one of great wisdom,
And ruler of this kingdom.
Upon this throne I sit and gaze,
Into the dark and murky haze.

My eyes glow a vermilion red,
As I burn into the souls of the dead.
To pass the judgement on their fate;
Shall they go to Heaven, or Hell's gate?

Surrounded by darkness and by gloom,
This is my fate, and my doom. 
Bound to this infinite misery was I,
By the Gods who dwelled beyond the sky.

I once was human and full of faith,
But now I am but an ominous wraith.
The sins and selfishness of society,
Has left me torned and cold; devoid of sincerity.

With bitterness I now scrutinize,
Into the deads' past lives.
Have they sinned and lied,
Or abused others before they died?

Did they used others for a purpose,
Were they infidels and promiscuous?
Or were they loyal and benevolent,
Chivalrous and perhaps God sent.

Only ones whom are humble and truthful,
Shall enter Heaven with their souls.
All others shall be at eternal mercy,
To Hell's flames; this, I do decree....





Depression
Is my inspiration,
For joy has no meaning to me.

Gloom
Is my theme,
For gayeity has no depth.

Sadness
Is my form,
For happiness has no structure.

Death
Is my ending verse,
Because no-one lives forever.




semaj and lai are the shit"

On his way to dinner when it took him by suprise
And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
The a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife

Time after time
I guess that love is blind
I couldn't read your mind
Line after line

Line after line
It was written in your eyes
I guess it's no surprise
Time after time

I can hear them whispering
Shadows in the rain
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time

Line after line you broke me
Day after day
I watched love fade away
I wanted love to stay
Day after day

The games we played
The foolish things we say
The pain won't go away
Day after day

Candlelight is shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been
Day after day
The games we play you broke me

Candlelights are shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time
Line after line you broke me

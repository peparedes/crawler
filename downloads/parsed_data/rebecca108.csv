I'm making a resolution today to start putting my thoughts on LJ instead of feeding the voices in my head. This way, my friends can tell me when I'm acting like a raving lunatic or give me solace in my daily craze. 

I had an enlightening experience today. I know I am moving in a positive forward direction, regardless of what crap is raining down on my life. Sometimes, it's just easier to crawl into bed and hibernate for a while. I am doing all I can to force that thought out of my mind. 

I have had my cards read and an astrology chart done and the freakish thing is that both were intriguing and eye opening because they both had the same things to say. I have been re-reading the secret, reading about crystals and stones and I am becoming more fond of the idea that we are the creators of our own destiny and that we can channel energies from the universe bringing those to the forefront whether that be looking for love, money, harmony, peace or stability. 

I spent time this weekend with some of my favorite people. These are the people I gravitate towards when I need grounding or clarity. NOW... if you knew this bunch, you'd say ""Rebecca- are you CRAZY?"" Every time I go visit them, I feel so much better. One of my best friends who I've known for 12 years is the most centering person I know. I am so fortunate to have him in my life. The unconditional love and support mean more to me than I think he will ever know. The others in the group are warm and inviting and always welcome me (and the voices) with open arms and usually some form of liquor! They always give me words of advice and solace. I don't know what I would do without these amazing people in my life. I'm so grateful for them. 

On that note- getting mushy... until next time... never forget...

Live, Laugh, Love. (This was mine, before it was Hallmark!)"

"event","Today I'm trying to be the strong, confident woman who I attempt to portray every day and am failing miserably. I just found out that another one of the men who have passed me over is getting married. To the woman he met right after me and who he has known for it seems only 5 minutes! The thing that kills me is that I always get the bullshit ""I just don't want a relationship"" when in reality, they just don't want a relationship with me. WOW. That deflates an ego pretty darn quickly. UGH! When will it be my turn to have someone who loves me and cares?

Hoping you all have love and friendship in your lives.
Hugs!"

"event","I went to hang at the bar with my folks last night and give my friend Jessie her Christmas gift. It is a beautiful hand blown glass necklace and she loved it. I'm so happy that she liked it. I figured she would but you never know. As I'm sitting eating my dinner, she asks what my plans are for New Years. I say the embarrassing nothing and she asks me if I want to go to a party with her and some of her friends that I know from the bar. I really enjoy hanging out with these people- I've been to a few parties of theirs and although they don't hold a candle to Marc's, they can fill in when I can't get to RI. Jessie and Johanna are really fun, along with Geoff and Lauren. I'm not entirely sure who will be at this shindig but I know it's going to be a bit wild which is what I need right now. I think I just need a night of not thinking and some flirtations! I better drink fast and early so I can duck out if the blue lights start down the street... 

I wish you all a very happy and safe New Year's."

"event","I hope you all enjoyed your Christmas. I had a fairly decent day with my family. My sister was being obnoxious, but what else is new. Funny thing is, you'd think since she's the older sister she would have learned that when talking about someone (me) she should not do it while I am within earshot. Alas, she did not, so I ended up feeling like crap and hating my living situation for a good portion of the day...

The most bizarre thing just happened... Forrest just sent me a ""friend request"" on myspace! This the idiot who didn't think I was worthy of his friendship a few months back. What to do, what to do? Do I friend him and let him back into my life? Has he grown up and realizes that people can be friends after they've slept together? OR, do I deny the friend request as he did me in June (this is how I found out about the serious gf) and play the game? Just keep him out of my life? Either way, at least I know what kind of person he is and wouldn't be blindsided again, or naive.

Damn, I wish I could still afford therapy! What do you guys think?  

Hope all is well!

"event","This morning I was pleasantly surprised with a small token gift from one of my subcontractors. This is what makes the holidays special to me. The gifts that are unexpected, and the ones that someone has put thought into. It's the knowledge that someone was thinking of you and appreciating your work, friendship, love, etc. that is what reminds me what the holidays are all about. Just the fact that this person went even a little out of their way to say Happy Holidays means the world to me. It doesn't take much for me to feel appreciated, but it means so much. 

Happy Holidays to all. May you all be blessed with the unexpected joy of knowing someone is thankful for you this year."

"event","A funny thing happened on my way to the forum...ok, it was work really. Some of you may know about ""Forrest Hump"" (Forrest is not his real name) and some of you may not. Here's the breakdown. We met last Christmas and the time we were together was intense... all two and a half weeks of it. Then this guy that I thought was so wonderful turned into someone who was just a ""special $*@^ buddy"". I was fine with that setup until I found out after one of our rendezvous that he was in a serious relationship (a month later they broke up.) I admit, I went through some conflicted times during that time, thinking that I could be the other woman even if it was only for the sex. I THANKFULLY realized with the help of my friends that I was worth way more than that and a thousand times more than Forrest could ever offer me. Although he was the guy who got me back into the world of dating after a 3 year sabbatical from my last hellish relationship I decided that I needed more for myself than he could ever offer me. It took me months to actually be ok with this decision and I made a lot of errors in judgment in the process. (Alright, alright, I acted the way Brit did when she finally shed K-Fed.) I'm much more healthy now and realize that if anything, I should be thanking Forrest for the wisdom and self esteem I have gained since knowing him. 

Ok, so the funny thing... I haven't spoken to Forrest since August when I called to wish him a Happy Birthday- he turned 25 (right there, WHAT WAS I THINKING.. younger men just don't work for me.) However, this morning on my way to work, I was running an hour late because I needed to sleep since I've not been home any night this week at a reasonable time (and I slept right through my alarm.) Right there, on 95 was Forrest's work van- hazards going, hood up... OH MY- did I get a laugh. Of course, I called to chuckle at his expense and wished him Happy Holidays. He (as he always does) said he'd ""be in touch"" but I won't hear from him. Six months ago, this would have really bothered me but now I am strong enough and smart enough to know this will not happen and if it does, not to pick up the phone. His myspace account states that he is in a relationship again and according to the comments it seems as though he's in love. I wish him the best and pray that he doesn't stray on this girl.

So, as we close out 2006, I can be proud of who I've become. It was a hard, long road with many twists and turns with roots trying to trip me up but I've come out the other side knowing myself much better and knowing what a great person I am. Thanks Forrest for giving me the rope to hang my past on. 

Happy Holidays Everyone."

"event","I've been getting slammed by numerous friends that I am not ""available"" online via LJ or Myspace. The thing is, why do I want to write down my most personal thoughts for anyone to see? I'm not a blogger. I'm not a writer and I hate getting grammatical corrections from people. What's worse is whenever I find notes that I've written or diary entries from important times in my life, when I read them I realize how ridiculous they are. How ridiculous my worries and fears are. How much I've grown as a person because of those bad things and good that have shaped me. We all have things we wish we hadn't said or done. Why would I want them online for everyone else to read?

So my friends, you want to know what's been going on. Here it is, all laid out for you. I've been working 2 jobs, trying to save for a nice Christmas with my family and friends, trying to find time to see people and hang out with new prospects and failing miserably on all counts. Although, I will say this weekend turned it around some. That's the thing with true friends. It doesn't matter how much time has passed or when the last time you spoke was. When you see each other, it's like no time has passed at all and after the visit you feel more centered.

I went to Popicn's house this weekend. (I'm still new, so I don't know how the hell to link his page to this.) Let me tell you, although I may have had a minor meltdown, the weekend overall was wonderful. Friday I sat in traffic and thought I was going to lose it by the time I finally got to Cranston 3 hours after I set out. We started in right away with making my 6 dozen cookies for the cookie exchange. What fun that was although I think the smell of cookies is going to make me nauseous for at least another month. I met some new people, saw some friends, and although I was convinced I wouldn't drink, I did. I only had one though. (Ok, it was quite strong and I had quite the buzz going but I stopped at one.) I mostly behaved, so that was good, however, I feel badly that I wasn't drunk enough to present a ""performance piece"" like everyone else did. Ah well, maybe some other time. I can't help it, even in front of friends I am still that 14 year old girl that everyone was laughing at when I was performing my solo.

Saturday was great- Popicn and I went out attempting to finish my Christmas shopping. I hate shopping this time of year. People are crazy- the lines are out of control and all the stores make you feel like you're missing out on these great opportunities. We were somewhat successful but not to a point of completing what I needed. We spent the afternoon chilling, and trying to recover from a lack of sleep from the night before. Why is it that I always end up being awake until 5 when I go there? I'm too old for that. (I'm definitely feeling it today.) Popicn made a delicious roasted chicken and I spent all night regretting the pizza hut we'd had that afternoon. My meltdown occurred sometime around 10:30 or so when I realized that I'd over committed myself again. Why I continue to do this, I have no idea. My aunt's dog, which she inherited when my cousin was killed, had to be put to sleep last week. Crystal was a 14.5 year old English Bulldog. When I spoke to my aunt the day that she had to put Crystal to sleep, I promised her I'd make her favorite Pecan Turtle Bars for our Christmas celebration on Sunday. Knowing I'd be away all weekend and I couldn't make them before the weekend, I lost it. I could not figure out how much 2/3 cup of butter was. Thank goodness for Heather and Marc. They were great. Marc came to my rescue and Heather tried diligently to find a conversion online. Turns out they were just fine and a big hit at the party. I praised both Marc and Heather to my family when they said how good the bars were... if it weren't for them, there wouldn't have been any! 

So Sun, I didn't get a chance to see Popicn before I left which always leaves me feeling sad, but I understand that the weekend was crazy and because of his back he hasn't been sleeping well. It just means I'll have to make another trip there sooner rather than later. I got to see my family and meet my uncle's new wife. I'm not sure about her yet. She seems nice, but I don't know her. We sat around after most people left watching the PBS special of Michael Buble. It was good to see some reaction out of my nana. She is suffering from Alzheimer's and it's tough to see her trying to communicate when she can't and is scared. On my way home I spoke to Inga and it seems as though all the drama of a few months past is finally at an end and we're back to being good friends. Hopefully I'll get the chance to see her and Josh this week. Although I have no free time this week at all.

FINALLY- I got home to my wonderful feather bed that my sister got me as an early Christmas gift. It's a fantastic thing. It was so hard to get up this morning knowing that I'm the lone person in the office today. It always makes for a boring day. Although I've wasted away quite a bit of time writing this. Maybe I'll write more often. 

Well- Happy Holidays everyone. Hopefully this will pacify most for a while."

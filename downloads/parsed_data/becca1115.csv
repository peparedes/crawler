"event","The love thing, I mean. I guess I will always be in love with Mike. I saw him for the first time in a long time, and I wanted to know how I felt. *Deep breath* I saw him, and I felt kind of like I always do: I get self-conscious around him, kind of like I think he's watching me all the time, and I never look at him, rarely speak to him. On the plus side, I am happy to say that although I was consciously aware of him the entire night, I pretty much put it into the back of my mind, and kept reminding myself of all the reasons why I don't like him, which are valid reasons. And, when a guy got up to sing a love song, he did it so well, and I thought of my James the entire time, and how much I missed him, even though it's been less than 24 hours since I last was with him. Whatever feelings I have or had for Mike, although they are still existant, I may still be in love with Mike, but the feelings I have are locked away, pushed back into my mind. When I'm away, I don't think about him, and if I do, the thoughts are bitterweet, well, actually more just bitter. This is good, right? Whatever. I'm glad. I don't care if I'm still in love, because my friend was probably right; once you fall in love, you never fall out of it. I miss James. I feel better now. I can live with this."

"event","Anyways. Where was i? Oh yeah, my first love. I've heard couples in school say they love each other. They'll say it after like two weeks, or even *gasp!* after a whole month. They don't know what it means. You have to really know it. It's not physical attraction, it's not just personality, how good he smells, feels, how good his caress is, it's everything and more. It's that feeling you get in your soul. Not your mind, ot even your heart, it's your soul. That's love. That's the thing that brings the best feeling in the world, the greatest ecstacy, the feeling that you're home with him, for the rest of your life, and also the most painful stabs that one can possibly endure, the feeling that someone actually takes your heart, tears it into a thousand pieces, and feeds them slowly to all your fears, hopelessness, despairs, and agonies at the same time. I actually felt that. It is the most incredible thing in the world. Great and terrible. Unfortunately, I had fallen in love, only to be shunned. He never loved me, I don't even know if he really liked it. When you only have one sided love, you tend to feel the latter feelings more. Actually, that's pretty much the only feeling you get after you realize that he will never come for you. It took me two years, two full years, after two boyfriends, for me to try to get over him, to try to forget the way he made me feel, for me to say ""I don't love him."" I was almost there. And then I saw him again. I saw his face, I heard his voice, and the fact that I was just in his presence again, ripped, tore, dimolished the walls that I had spent two years of my life trying to build up. I was still in love with him.A good friend of mine, a young philosopher you might say, shared his views on love with me. He told me that if you fall in love with someone, it doesn't matter how many years go by, how few times you see him, you will always be in love with that person. And I believe that he was right. I started dating James in October, over 7 months ago. And I have never felt so close to anyone before, with the exception of my first love. However, I had never told James I loved him. Still haven't and don't plan to until I fall in love with him. And he's ok with that. But while I was with James, I was still in love with MIke. I wasn't worried, I was still going to be James', but I told him that I had only been in love, and I told him my story. Despite that, James has been the best boyfriend I have had, and I thank God every day for him. 
There's something that I find interseting, and kind of disturbing. That's why I'm writing this. Lately, I'd say in the past two or three weeks, I've been thinking, searching myself, trying to see what I felt, and I have been able to look in myself and say I do not love Mike. That is strange because one doesn't just ""fall out of love"". Something else I realized is that it's possible, that deep down, I still might love him. The thing is, that James has given me some of the best memories of my life, and he has been such a good partner, it is possible that he has helped me push any feelings for Mike away, deep within myself, where it doesn't bother me. I no longer spend nights thinking about him, crying about him, wishing, and praying for him. I just don't think about him. nd if he comes up, I don't care. There's one other thing, though. I haven't seen him in about three weeks. That was when I went to see a play, and we ate dinner together, about 10 poeple. I sat next to him, and he sat next to a girl his age, and they knew each other well, and were very friendly with each other. The feeling I had was wierd, uncomfortable, and I didn't talk to him at all, and I did feel extremely jealous of him with that girl. But it was after that that I started realizing that I might not be in love, or at least have been numbed indefinietky to it. However, that was the last time I saw him. I should see him this Friday with a bunch of people, so I don't know how I will feel, but right now I feel pretty confident. I don't know, if anyone got this far, I'm somewhat confused, but after Friday I might be able to turn my head from this boy, looking up and onward, to leave this rather pitiful story to fade to black."

"event","Well, for anyone who cares, maybe that's just you lexi, I have been suffering from the worst disease ever for the past three years. Long, LONG, story put short, and in different entries, I had fallen in love with someone for the first time in my life. I thought it was impossible to fall in love at such a young age, and I NEVER use the word love unless I mean it. I have to feel it, I have to know it in my heart, corny as that sounds. I have not told anyone I have ever dated that I love tem, not even my current boyfriend, although it feels really, really close sometimes. Anyways, I have to past later. Bell just rang. Damn"

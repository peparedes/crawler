"event","Scout used to belong to this lady Ellen, Ellen could no longer care for Scout, Scout came here. He lived between my house and my neighbors (2 doors down), He slept most nights in her stable, spent the rest of the morning, da and night here, if not all night. Scout was *my* baby, my horse...my buddy. He was my first horse love. 
Ellen's son Ross, always thought Scout should just be killed, he felt Scout was useless. That was the whole reason I ended up with him. 
I needed to do some major fence work so Ellen said that she could house Scout for me for a month or two in Toro Canyon. I checked this out twice with her son making sure it was understood that he would NOT be killed. I paid for food, vet and all other care in advance. I talked with Ellen 3 days ago, I said Scout could be back by the end of this week and I would be taking him with me to WillowBrook so he could hang out in the pasture. She seemed delighted and said that Scout was always sad when I left, she felt like he missed me and my/his house. I told her I missed him as well. I have seen him 4 to 5 days a week since he has been there. 
I told Ellen on that note, that I would be there this Friday to get him. She said fine.
This morning my phone rang and all I heard was my hysterical neighbor crying into my machine. I didn't even pick up the phone, I just ran like hell down the street. She could hardly get the words out. I stood there frozen, no intake of air, no heart beat...no tears. ""Scout is dead"" rang in my ears.
I didn't cry until I was away from her house.

NOBODY, NOT ELLEN, NOT HER SON, NOT THE VET...NOBODY HAS CALLED ME STILL!
TO THIS VERY MINUTE...NO CALL!!!!

Karen got the news from the vets tech who said she couldn't bare the thought of calling me and asked Karen to call me. 

COME ON! 

I'm so pissed and sad and broken and dark and empty and hollow and....just so sad.

Karen ended up calling Ellen, asking her why, why did she do it, why did Ross do it, why didn't she call???

Ellen said she felt that I would have had a hard time with it and it's what needed to be done.

She said...this really gets me...""IT WAS GOD'S WILL"".

Okay...God's will? God's will, you're telling me. That's what you're saying to me? It's God's will?

THAT MAKES MY FUCKEN EARS BLEED HEARING THAT!

This is no ""will of God""!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

THIS*IS*NO*WILL*OF*GOD!

None! No!

""God"" does not will a horse to be dead at the hands of the vet. It is her will!
God is not paying the fricken ass vet...she is!
 
(I am not getting down on the vet if that is at all coming across, Dr. Saunders has fought with me for this horse, he is my vet and I love him and his staff!!!!)

THIS IS SO WRONG I CAN'T STAND IT AND IT'S TOOOOOO LATE...THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING I CAN DO. MY BOY IS GONE.

DID ANYONE NOT THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE AT LEAST LIKED TO SAY GOOD BYE? HOW ABOUT THAT? 

JUST I DUNNO.... I just wanted to say good bye if this is what had to be...and I can't and I never can...and I just have to have that...that...no good bye or thank you for giving me this insane gift, thank you for letting me love you till i thought my heart would explode...
 nothing...no good bye."

"event","A horse is a horse till it spokes with you on its back...then it's a RODEO BULL!

Just a quick update on the lesson today.
Rode Bristol who seemed to be a smidge moody today. Moody like a jackass.
All was going well, cantering through and around barrels, zig zag in and out of cones, practice lead changes....blah, blah, blah... got to the far corner of the ring, tree limbs comes down, the horse looks, I look, the horse does a double take and as fast as he turned his head, we went flying side ways at about 65 miles an hour. My first thought is Maile...little voice inside head says ""oh fuck, not this""...we then come to a complete halt for about two seconds, horses head goes way far down then way far up, front feet lift off of the ground, all I see is blue sky, my next thought is Brandy...little voice inside my head goes ""please let me stay on like she did"". (I think I shut my eyes). I then felt like popcorn. Yup, rodeo queen. Horse bucking in circles like a wild man over and over. I counted 6 full circles. I finally had enough and pulled his chin to his chest and yelled as loud as I could ""HO! you Mother Fucker!""

Once we stopped, my trainer came flying over to where Bristol and I where standing. (I've never been so happy to just stand still on a horse). I thought she was going to ask me if I was okay but she didn't. She ran over to say ""OH MY GAWD! YOU STAYED ON! YOU ROCK! THAT WAS GREAT! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, YOU DID EVERYHING RIGHT! YOU GO GIRL"" ""other than when he reared up, you stood and leaned forward...no no""! Yeah, props for??? Hanging on for dear fricken life! Go me."

LOVE my LJ friends...very much sucks that I can't be there to do something for them...I want to, in my heart. 

You guys...mentally...I'm there cleaning your houses, cooking you food, feeding animals, fluffin the pillows...(pouring you a beer Miss Conscience)....you know...all that schtuff...the friend help out schtuff.

Jake and I are going to do our ceremonial ""let it be ok"" dance. It has a little prayer that goes with it...we made it up but do it when things get not okay. It's a dance we do outside, Jake said doing this outside is a vital part of our dance because nature is everything and angels in heaven can see us better if we're outside. We do it rain or shine because it HAS to be outside. We save it for the *really* not okay stuff. As silly as it sounds, I do believe that there is power in numbers, angels listen to children first and when something truly comes from the best place in your heart...it totally works!

So, Jake just called me to go out to the old oak, he said the sun was setting...
Off to dance....

I wonder if he will do this with his kids???"

<lj-cut>HOW TO INTERPRET the horse CLASSIFIED ADS

WEARS BRIDLE WELL:  His ears are so freakin big it
won't fall off

NICE EYE:  only one of course

GOOD DISPOSITION: when buzzed on Ace

BOMB PROOF:  When you are wearing full body armour

GREAT TRAIL HORSE:  Yep, when you are alone, leading
him on a 20 foot rope and in the indoor arena

GAME:  Range cowboy prospect

KID'S HORSE: Great for the child that
weighs 190 lbs, is 6 feet tall, lifts weights and
wears a hockey helmet.

USED ON HUNTER PACE:  Once, then he mowed down the
Hunt  Master and is now barred in the lower 48 from
Hunt Clubs

LIGHTLY RACED: Only raced 12 times  (in a week)

GOOD WITH FARRIER:  And his 10 buddies and their handy
dandy sling/ace/ropes

NICE TO WORK WITH: when out for the count during
clipping (Ace  again!)

STALLION PROSPECT:  Maimed the vet for life when they
tried to castrate him
last week

THBX: It has long legs, must be THB somewhere in
there!

ALSO DRIVES:  when hooked in the middle of an 8 horse
hitch of Belgians

BIG TROT - can't canter within a 2-mile straightaway 

NICELY STARTED - lunges, but we don't have >enough
insurance to ride him yet 

TOP SHOW HORSE - won a reserve championship 5 years
ago at a show with unusually low entries due to a
hurricane 

HOME BRED - knows nothing despite being raised on the
back porch 

BOLD - runaway 

GOOD MOVER - runaway 

ATHLETIC - runaway 

NEEDS INTERMEDIATE RIDER - runaway 

NEEDS EXPERIENCED RIDER - ""dead"" runaway 

DEAD QUIET - just dead 

RECENTLY VETTED - someone else found something badly
wrong with this horse 

BIG BONED - good this has mane and tail or >would be
mistaken for a cow 

DOING COURSES - when tranquilized to the eyeballs and
lunged six hours straight before 

WELL MANNERED - hasn't stepped on, bitten, >or kicked
anyone for a week 

PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED - hasn't stepped on, bitten,
or kicked anyone for a month 

STARTED O/F - started overfeeding because can't ride 

SHOULD MATURE 16 HANDS - currently 13 h, dam is
14.2h, sire is 15 h, every horse in pedigree back 18
generations is under 15 h, but this horse will defy
his DNA and grow 

TO GOOD HOME ONLY - not really for sale unless you
can: 1) pay twice what he is worth; 2) allow current
owner to tuck in beddy-bye every night; and 3) are
willing to sign a 20-page legal document 

NO VICES - especially when he wears his muzzle 

LIGHT CRIBBER - we can't afford to build any more
barns and fences for the buzz saw 

NO TIME FOR HIM - he's lucky to be fed 

EXCELLENT DISPOSITION - never been out of the stall 

CLIPS, HAULS, LOADS - clippity, clippity is the sound
his hooves make when he hauls a** across the parking
lot when you try to load him.</lj-cut> 

I just find it funny."

Sink Hole...so much money.....Front Gate.....so much money....Mold wall....so much money....dude to dig trench under our house to fix pipe....so much money...my favorite face cream.....so much money...new shirt I bought myself as a ""feel better about so much money....ON SALE!

One outa five ain't bad.

Seriously, I don't know what we're going to do. Mold and dig trench under the house to fix pipes is the MOST pressing. Sink Hole in back yard runs a close second. The sink hole is due to the conversion from septic to sewer...the thing is, when they did this, they didn't fill in the tank or surrounding ground. Yeah, it's like a quarter of our back yard which I put a ""HOT FENCE"" (low voltage) around for fear that kids will jump around there. The land inspection guy said that it was dangerous at this stage to have anyone standing on it. Grrrrrrfrickeneat!
Okay, so at least we caught it before something terrible happened. 

I need a money tree and I need it today.

We ""put off"" our family trip to Hawaii...no longer can afford it.

We did make reservations to take Jake snowboarding this winter...we kept those plans. That's not to bad...Jake has his own gear thank heaven.

EVERYTHING IS A FORTUNE!
and I feel like we can never get ahead...the minute we have any money everything goes to shit. EVERYTHING!

It kills me that I was so happy that we finally made some (little but better than nothing) profit this year. I thought things would be a little less tense. I thought my tax return wouldn't have to pay the property tax this year and we would have an extra 4,ooo dollars just for whatever.

It just makes me sad.
That's all, just sad."

Plumber coming out today. Part of the wood wall will probably need to come out.

Jake still sick. Fever gone. Upset belly, headache, ugly poison oak/ivy still in effect!

Brandy calmed down from yesterday's Maile horse spill. Sleepy girl she was after that, scared the caca outa her Maile did. My sister was a trooper...a funny came out of it all though. 
The night before this happened, I was grossing Brandy out with talk of snot and egg yolks. She was gaging so loudly on the phone it just fuled my fire to think of anything goopy I could. Mean, I know but fun...yes indeed! Poor thing has such a weak stomach! (I'm sure this is only funny to me due to my iron belly.) So when Maile went to the hospital they pumped her full of Morphine, so much so that she puked. Brandy was there holding the bucket for her. 
MAILE PUKED EGGS, TOAST AND COFFEE! Hah! As I was saying, just the night before I was talking about eggs...making Brandy choke and gag! What a coincidence!
Brandy said it smelled so bad that she her self started choking and gaging all over again! She had to make a quick escape to the hall way to breathe some NON-EGG air! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAH! Oh the joys of sisterhood!

It's the little things I tell you, that make being Brandy's sister so ridiculously enjoyable! 

So, here I sit waiting for the plumber who is going to charge me and arm and a leg to fix this fricken pipe...

"event","Eh, whata day. Jake came home with poison oak, fell asleep at a way to early time last night...should have known something was up. He woke up this morning and didn't want breakfast. All you Momma's out there KNOW that is the number one morning warning that your kid is NOT right.
Jake decided he was going to try to go to school.
I had my riding lesson at 11 this morning. At 10:45 my cell phone rings and it was Jake, Jake in the nurses office with a fever of 101.5 feeling like comelete ass.
I told him I'd be right there. I was secretly mourning my riding lesson (for which keeps me sane) all the way to school. Until I saw his beautiful blushed face...I got him in the car and he started in with the ""I'm sorry Momma's...I know today is your lesson""...I started feeling like shit because all the way to pick him up I was saying ""WHY TODAY?????"" I told him it was fine, no big deal...he begged me to still go and to park the 4runner in such a way that he could watch me ride. I said NO...but...with enough ""pleases"" I caved...happy caving that is!
I parked Jake right next to the ring so he could watch me SUCK ASS on this new horse.
I had my lesson on reining and penning on this little horse ""Alabama"" who only had one thing on his mind...COWS...or anything else he could heard...DOGS...MY TRAINER...TWO WOMEN WALKIN BY...
I had my ideas and he had his ideas and our ideas DID NOT at all match up. Not even close. It was so bad that my WONDERFUL and PERFECT trainer...Stacey gave me a crop. The horse had breaks like a new fricken car. To go from a fast canter to a dead stop on a western saddle is...uh...painful. My vagina and that horn are now married to eachother. I did get loads of ""GOOD JOBS"" and ""YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT"" which Stacey does not give those out on a regular basis. In fact, it's so rare for her to sing the praises of a student, much less me, I almost didn't know who the hell she was talking to. Today was the first day that I was not screamed at for my posture nor was I screamed at because I have a loose right lead. In my head I felt so out of control with the horse that my posture was good, my hands where low, my shoulders where square, pelvis rollin like a MO FO, I kept my eyes on where I was going, toes up, heals down, perfectly balanced...
If I wasn't riding MR. HORSE ON A COW HEARDING MISSION it would have been the perfect riding day.
Next lesson I get to ride Bristol who I have had my eye on from day one, Stacey said it was time I could ride him...music to my ears."

(Thanks a lot ""Jake's Dad"" you SOB!)

Yeah, picked up Jake at 6 tonight. His poor little legs are covered in red, poofy, blistery welts. It is seeping some God forsaken something yucky. His is in total agony. I Q-Tipped his grossness with some crap I picked up at the drug store. 

His sweet little face was so upside down...pouty lip...crinkled eyebrows...pathetic I tell you! All he could muster up when he got into the car was ""Momma...can you make this better for me pleaaaaassssse?""
To the drug store we went to buy every last thing that said ""FOR POISON IVY/POISON OAK"" on it. I'm loaded down with every last itchy scratchy reliever you could imagine! Any of you guys need something for poison anything...I am your girl!

Not only that...he fell asleep at 7:45. Must be exhausting having this rash!
I've never had it but I am well equipt if for some reason I get it.

His Jackass Dad never even put anything on it. Not even a fricken band-aid or a fricken anything! Jake said he got it on Saturday. So...what???? His Dad just let him sit there with the S**T running down his legs? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! That drived me nuts! On top of that...when it finally made Jake cry (which Jake can hold in some serious tears) his Dad told him to ""suck it up"". I'll tell you who's going to be sucking something up....Jake's Dad! He'll be sucking every meal he has for the rest of his life up through a fricken straw if he comes in one square inch of my ass! (Until I calm down that is and when Jake's nasty rash is gone).

Random act of...coupon giving!

Saturday I saw this collar and leash set that I wanted for my dog. It was 40 bucks and...well...a riding lesson is 50 bucks and coco has tons of collars.
I decided that I could make the set myself so off I went to Michaels craft store. I bought the tiny little baby pink ribbon roses for $1.50, the collar (at the dreaded PetCo which I hate)was $2.99 and the leash was $3.99. 
I brought my schwag to the front counter and waited for this lady that had a load of kids and a pile of Christmas stuff. I noticed in her hand was a 40% off coupon. When the lady at the counter looked at the lady in front of me with a sad look I just new her coupon was NOT working for her. In my purse I had a 50% off coupon. I was saving it for a big load of stuff I was going to get closer to Thanksgiving. 
The lady in front of me was looking at her basket trying to figure out what she could put back and still keep her little one's happy. IT KILLED ME!
Without a word I slid my coupon towards the lady. Her face lit up and a smile that went from ear to ear was in full bloom. ""REALLY?"" she said. ""ARE YOU KIDDING? I CAN HAVE THIS?"" You would have thought I had given her a pint of blood. I smiled and said ""go ahead, it's fine"" and off with her stuff she went. I know it's a silly small thing, nontheless it warmed my heart as if it where something huge."

"event","Ahhhh...Sunday. 
Jake will be home at 6! Can't wait. Miss ma' baby I do!

I'm over saying anything ""Independent filmish"". Screw it.

Am going riding tomorrow at 11 with a new trainer Stacey. She's gonna kick my ass I know it. I'm actually a smidge nervous.

I gave Coco a real bone last night, got it for her yesterday at the butcher shop. She gets so strange when you give her bones! She could care less if you pick her up mid-dinner, put your hand between her and a cookie...give that bitch a bone and *TRY* to get near her! She attacked Andre's hand for no reason when he was leaving for work today. His hand was no where near the stupid bone. She made a purpose to jump from couch to chair to get his swinging hand! I made a fast dash for my dog as so her ""Dad"" wouldn't get mad at her. Spoiled girl that she is. I couldn't help but laugh (to myself) and give her a smooch on her nose.
While she was taking one of her many morning naps...I found the bone and tossed it. Not safe to have the bone when the kid comes home. When there's no bone in sight...she is the sweetest thing you could ever imagine. Even our mail guy loves her. A few times a week he brings her a cookie and hugs her tight in his arms. Must be a nice change for a mail guy to be able to smooch a pooch. Not to mention I love when he brings the mail to the door! Nice puppy perk. Thanks Co!

Okay going to download some pics of Scout, Coco and Jake (in his Halloween costume). Need to call ma' sista and see if she wants e mailed or regular photo's that come in the delivered post.

See you guys later!!"

Aches and pains from ye ol' horse...better.

Went to a store called ""Island View"" today, little store on the beach in a small town place called Capinteria just outside of Summerland, which is right outside of Santa Barbara. Very cool. I loved everything. I want my whole house to look and smell just like that store.

Rented a few flicks. I was trying to get in touch with my independent film side. I rented ""Last Days"" a film by Gus Van Sant, it was was selected by the Cannes Flim festival in 2005. It's based on the last days of Curt Cobain. Jury's still out. Maybe my independent film side is out...I dunno. Okay, so it must be my independent film side that is out because all I want to tell you about this movie is that the guy, the main character ""Blake"", is HOT! (His name is Michael Pitt). I really was trying to think of something artsy or smart to say...some kind of deep reflection of this film. All I can come up with is the main dude is HOT.

Now that I'm feeling not so smart I will tell you this. I will be going to the Art Museum tomorrow to surround myself with Masterpieces so I don't feel so inept and stupid. After that I will dazzle you with my jocular interpretation of this damn independent film! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I just said ""jocular""! HAHAHAHAHAH! S.A.T word! Never mind...If I can bust out with ""jocular"" I'm still okay. Ha! That made me laugh!

Okay, on that ""jocular"" note...I'm off to the couch with my soft blankets. 
I am the biggest nerd I know!"

"event","Okay..Jack Monty is this kid that started in with my nephew on the school bus...long story short...he ended up getting his...we now find it funny to say ""I'm going to go Jack Monty on yer ass""...just giving you the 411.

So, speaking of Jack Montey, my family seems to be in full Monty swing. EVERYONE is going Jack Monty on someone as of the past 3 or 4 days. My sister and the bus driver, my sister and my neice, my sister and Brandon, Dustin and the real Jack Monty, me and Jake's doctor, me and our neighbor, maile and her real estate guy, maile and mike, I'm sure my brother in law is chewing someone's ass out on the damn boat...our Mother is going to go Jack Monty on Brandy and I via the mail. She warned us first. Nice eh? 
Although I fear that Brandy might escape the mail Monty due to her reaction when our Mother called to warn us she was doing this. Our Mother and other members of our family have pegged my sister as...let's say...excitable. They DO NOT like to rub her the wrong way. For no good reason might I add. I sometimes think that my family and I know two different Brandy's. I tell you she has them fooled. She loves it. I'm green with envy. Sometimes I don't even know who the hell they're talking about. Maybe I just get some ""front of the line pass"" when it comes to her. If you where to ask me in person, I would tell you she just loves me more than anyone else. It'll be just my luck to be the only one of the three of us to recieve some shitty Mother mail. Actually, that won't work out for her either, if it truly upsets me, and I call my sister, our Mother usually ends up with only one working ear after my sister is done ""speaking her mind"".
It should be interesting. I can't imagine what words that woman has for me.
I'll let you know. If it's really good and daughter ass chewy...I'll just post it. 
Time to retire. We painted two walls today...they look amazing! I love this house.
Sweet dreams!!!!!

"event","Our posts and rails are being replaced today! That's great!

Yesterday a very loud girl showed up at my house. I guess one of the guys who had worked on our wood floors told her to come by. Her story was...well...sad. She had been living in La Conchita. Last year that's where the mountain slide was, killing 10 people or so when the rains came. Seems that she was living there during the slide, her and her donkey. Since then, she has moved place to place and has been boarding her donkey. I don't know about other places but here, boarding starts at 350 dollars a month. That does not incluse feed or vet or shoveling poo. That's all extra. It's a fortune to board a horse or donkey! It's almost not worth it to board, unless you're loaded. 
Anyway... She came to my house (never called, just showed up) with her Mom. She said that she can't afford boarding and whatnot anymore and when she started to say, she ""just couldn't get rid of him"" her eyes filled with tears. Yeah, my heart was pretty much in my throat at that point. She wanted to know if she could leave her donkey at my house and she said that she couldn't afford much rent although she could pay for food. Never mentioned vet but she would need to pay for that too. She had also ""heard"" from some people that I have taken in animals. (If I ever find those people, I'll kill them, I don't want that kind of press. It's hard for me to say no to an animal.) 
Long story short, I told her that I didn't want rent. I'm not a rental place. I don't want it. I did tell her that I was looking for a horse and if the donkey lived here...well...I'm not getting a horse. I also said that this was our home,  and I am a little concerned about people just appearing outside. I like the quiet and if I want to walk around naked...well shit...it's my house, I don't want to worry about someone showing up. The thing is...she should be able to see her animal when ever she feels like it. I would want that. I'm sure she does too. On the other hand...I want to help them out. She won't ever find a place like this that won't charge her. There is an obvious lack of ""do it out of the kindness of your heart"" thing going on here...
I just don't know if I want some person here whenever they feel like it and I feel strange saying we need to arrange visiting hours...I don't know, I'm really torn. By the way...THE DONKEY IS TO DIE FOR CUTE! But still...need to preserve my bubble here. 
This too, I got this incredible feeling that she...is not the most stable person. The kind of person that makes you take steps back when they talk to you. It looks to me and sounds to me as well that she has had a hard time in life. I saw on the seat of her car a picture of a guy being arrested, handcuffed and being escorted by police. I wanted to aske but thought it was better if I didn't know. 
My heart says take the donkey for her...my head says you don't want any part of this person...
Help!"

Andre's Brother and Sister-in-law are on the was here from LA. Not really looking forward to her coming down an bitching and moaning about EVERYTHING. Sometimes I can deal with it better than others...today...not one of those dealing days. She also forwarned us from her cell phone that ""she isn't feeling well"". Great.

"event","Long story short (I hope)....

I called Jake's Dr. this morning, explained what had happened yesterday and they wanted to see him RIGHT THEN!
I raced to school (he felt well enough to go he said)and picked him up and drove like a mad woman fighting back tears (because I'm like that) and made it to the Dr.'s office in 12 minutes flat. I made amazing time! 
They asked a lot of questions and ran a million tests. 
Whatever was going on...it was somewhat urgent because before we could even wrap our heads around all the things they were saying...Jake was having a CT and an MRI.
I finally got to process everything while he had the MRI. They let me sit in there, handed me ear plugs and told me it was going to be fine. Fine? I didn't feel very fine watching my kid in an MRI tunnel with tears running down his cheeks. He was great though. He never moved. Still as he could be...he took every test with such grace. Trooper! 
Jake at age 3 suffered his first migraine (sp?). They are isolated to his right temple. Swelling is also present when headache comes. I have had only a slight headache...his headaches are INSANE! So, because of his headache history, they want to rule out a tumor, blockage or fluid. He was done with the CT and MRI by 12:05. They told me his reading would be done in a half hour to an hour and someone would call me. It's now 2:25 and I'm silently going crazy. I tried to call Jake's pedi-Doctor but the asshole nurse said ""we'll call you when we know something maaaaaaaammmmmmmmmm"". She hung up. Doesn't she have kids? or how about compassion? How can she not know that I am scared out of my mind and just want someone to call me and say he's FINE. Not much to ask under the circumstance eh?

This is the strange thing, the thing that makes me think it's all okay...
When Jake was a year and a half old he started to wheeze. They couldn't figure out why. They sent me to a specialist in the same place he went to today for a cystic fibrosis test. (I almost died that day...so scared)
It was the same kind of day. Hospital was crowded and the weather was the same...warm rain. I actually stood outside with him after the cystic fibrosis blood work screaming prayers to God and crying my eyes out. I BEGGED God to not take my baby...he didn't. or she didn't. or....you know. 
Today I did not stand in the rain screaming prayers or crying...I just did it in my head. Partially I didn't want to scare the shit out of Jake and he had already been through enough.
So here I am waiting. I hate waiting. I especially hate waiting when it's about Jake.
If they don't call me by 4...I'm calling back...I don't care if they hate me. I'll never make it a full night. I should have known not to take the half hour to an hour that they said for real. They're Doctor's. Can't blame a girl for wanting that to be true.
I'll be back with happy news (I know it!)"

Jake almost fainted this morning. It was horrible. I was in the sun room talking to him when I noticed he was swaying. I asked him if he was okay and he said he felt ""swooney"". He also said his ears ""felt like they didn't want to work"". I grabbed him in my arms just before his knees decided to give out. No color in the face, no color in his lips. I got him to the couch, gave him OJ, noticed he was sweaty and hands were shaking...now...color back in cheeks and lips, he ate a little, tummy fine...does complain of body aches. Flu? No fever, nothing weird on body or in mouth, no runny nose, no cough, ears are fine. I'm stumped. I called our ""urgent care""...office closed. Call ER at Hospital and asked to speak to a nurse, no call back yet. 

I need to pack everything up from our living room and den in the next two days. Our floors are being refinished. Shelves, mantle, small liftable furniture needs to be moved into the office. 

We can't be in our home for 3 days. We're going to stay at Andre's Mom's which will actually be nice. Her house is great to stay at and it just feels good to ""go home"" so to speak. The dog, the cat, the bird and the fish will all be going for a little holiday with us. 

Okay, nurse just called from ER and Jake's Dr. just called. They both said no need for and ER trip...Dr's appointment made for tomorrow morning. Low blood sugar may have been the cause....will be checked out tomorrow. They both said to watch for fever. If fever does set in to take him in tonight. Otherwise, hang tuff till the morning. 
That makes me feel a smidge better.

First though....HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRANDY! Yes, the gap is once again is being narrowed...she's 34...I'm 35...I love October! Anyway, Happy Birthday to my sister, my best friend....my everything in this world...I love you and hope 34 brings you everything wonderful!


As for me...time has been spent soul searching...I mean REALLY soul searching. I spent a load of time trying to figure out what it is I want out of this life time, what makes me happy, what makes my heart sing, what I will and will NOT accept, what I can and can*NOT* have in my life, what it all means and finally...how do I make it all happen. It's a lot. Well, at least a lot for me. 

I came to many conclusions and answered all of my own questions and even realized that although this searching was killing me...I was more than ready to come into my own, and not be scared of what the answers happened to be and it even felt okay to hear myself think them. I'm great at stuffing things away. I usually can say anything to someone else, I just can't say anything to me. I have a big mouth, I'm the first one to stick up for the under-dog, I can tell my ""friends"" exactly what I think even if they have no interest in my opinion. When it comes to my little family here...I say nothing. I'm to worried about popping the safty bubble.
So....as you can see...it got to the popping point. I burst the bubble and out came ALL OF IT. Every sensored thought was swimming around in open space. Not so comfortable I might add and very not ""me"". 
I said things to Andre that I never imagined saying eveahhhhhh! It was great, painful and scary but great nonetheless. 
The process of breaking down is for shit and I hate it but I think it was fight or flight. Well, okay maybe it was. Flight was my first reaction but on the scale was regret. Nobody hates a regret more than me... hate regret I tell you.
So there it was...all laid out and exposed on the floor. It felt like I went to school naked. (Bad). I just couldn't hold these things in anymore. I lost me, I lost sight, I lost happiness, I lost hope, I lost faith and really...I was just hoping that every time I went outside someone or something would come out of the sky, pluck me from earth and take me to heaven. Not a good way to be. 
I couldn't even fake the smile for Jake anymore. Everytime I saw his little face I just wanted to cry. 
That's where I have spent my time.
I came to some hellish tuff decisions, laid out all the things that where slowly, silently, driving me mad and let Andre in on what WAS and WAS NOT going to be. He did some of the same. Not on the same scale. After all, he was SHOCKED that anything was wrong at all, he was dumb founded that the words ""we have a HUGE problem"" where even said. He thought ""it was all fine"". 

I'm back, I'm whole again, I have peace and faith and some happiness which I hope will continue to grow. Rebuilding isn't easy but very worth it. 
I've had long talks with Jake concerning the subject, he was worried and sad. I brought clarity to his mind. I have always told Jake that this was his life too and as long as we are in it together, he will always know what is going on. He will never wake up to a surprise. I think it really helps not keeping him in the dark. Other Mom's that I know are very into not telling their kids ""grown up stuff"". I tell Jake. It's life, it's human nature, it's how man and woman, man and man and women and women in any kind of relationship work. Most of all it's human. I stress that. I don't cloud his mind with details he can't digest, I did however give him information to prepare him for things, to show him and teach him the ways of how people work in all situations. How they can work it out or not. It's just my parenting. If some parents want to keep there child in blinders, that's fine too. Just not for Jake and I. I never want him to feel surprised with how shitty the world is nor do I ever want him to be not ready for change or people's reactions to life situations. I maybe totally wrong and am fucking him up in all of this but I really just have to trust my heart. Jake trusts it, I should too. 
Well.....that's it. I'm glad to be back, I missed you guys!

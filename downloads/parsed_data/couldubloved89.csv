"event","so, just got back fromt the first session of preseason. ahh. i didnt do too badly though. first thing we did was run 3 miles. ahh. well there was a bunch of girls who finished after me, but it really pissed me off that some girls didnt do the whole thing. they totally cheated. grar. i hate to be all ""im a sophmore"" but they were all freshman. haha. anyways so then we did some plyos, and lots of sprints. it kinda sorta totally sucked. anyways so i went to christies after and got gatorade. yum. saw my coach (he went there too) and my mom totally embarrassed me. ew. fuck you mom. but the real reason im mad at her is that when we got home she was like ""oh, im thinking about working at ur school in the culinary dept"" (she used to be a teacher, but shes a chef now...ew"" and i was like ""oh"" and after like 5 mins i told her that it would be weird if she worked there....and she got so mad. but i told her it wasnt cause i didnt love her. but honestly who the fuck wants their mom working at their school. like thats where i go to escape but now she wants to come into it. she got mad cause she feels like shes not apart of my life and cause we never see eachother. but when i was like mom, would u have wanted nanna working at ur school? and since she went to NMH (norfield mount hermon, a boarding school) she was like yeah! i would have loved that. bull shit mom, total bull shit. ugh its just that i really dont think that MY school is where she should work. ah. anyways....now shes mad at me. we're not speaking. i love her but, seriously??? okay gotta go get ready for my second session of preseason. fabuloso.

"event","for all those times you stood by me 
For all the truth that you made me see 
For all the joy you brought to my life 
For all the wrong that you made right 
For every dream you made come true 
For all the love i found in you 
I'll be forever thankful baby 
You're the one who held me up 
Never let me fall 
You're the one who saw me through through it all 

You were my strength when i was weak 
You were my voice when i couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when i couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when i couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything i am 
Because you loved me 

You gave me wings and made me fly 
You touched my hand i could touch the sky 
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me 
You said no star was out of reach 
You stood by me and i stood tall 
I had your love i had it all 
I'm grateful for each day you gave me 
Maybe i don't know that much 
But i know this much is true 
I was blessed because i was loved by you 

You were my strength when i was weak 
You were my voice when i couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when i couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when i couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything i am 
Because you loved me 

You were always there for me 
The tender wind that carried me 
A light in the dark shining your love into my life 
You've been my inspiration 
Through the lies you were the truth 
My world is a better place because of you 

You were my strength when i was weak 
You were my voice when i couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when i couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when i couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything i am 
Because you loved me 

You were my strength when i was weak 
You were my voice when i couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when i couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when i couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything i am 
Because you loved me 

I'm everything i am 
Because you loved me


chinqueka i miss you. i am everything i am cause u loved me.

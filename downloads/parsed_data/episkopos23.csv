Having a 9 year old son and a 6 year old daughter on Christmas means I get to play with some awesome toys.

Millenium Falcon transformer... a Bratz Guitar Hero kinda game...

Anyone know what the album was called?

It also apparently included: ""Light Up My Life"" by Debbie Boone, and ""How Deep is Your Love?"" by the Beeeeeee Geeees.

If you can answer this riddle I will give you my first born marmoset!"

"event","30 years ago today the Elvis died.
8 years ago today William Ray Partridge Sr. died.

Hundreds of thousands will visit Elvis' grave over the course of the year... maybe even millions. A handful will pass my dad's grave on the way to see another long dead relative, only a few will stop to read his tombstone.

Elvis spent his later years eating too much shit and pumping drugs into his system to try and eek out the last years of his performance career. My dad spent his final years eating healthy and taking a perscription to try and grab a new lease on life.

Elvis made millions who never met him love him. My dad made everyone who ever met him love him.

There are differences and similarities between these two men as there are of all men. The biggest commonality is they both died today and they both died overweight and bloated (my dad acctually had his heart attack that hospitalized him around the 12th so by the time they declared him dead he was so pumped full of fluids he was hardly recognizable). The biggest difference is that one died because he was tired of living and had turned to drugs to help him figure out meaning and the other died because he forgot he wasn't immortal and tried to do too much for too many.

Too many of you never got to meet William Ray Partridge Sr. and that makes me saddest. He was, hands down, the single greatest man I've ever known."

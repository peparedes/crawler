With this in mind it&#39;s easier to accept the hard things in life as they come. I&#39;ve kept this mentality through most of my life, accepting things as they were becuase that was how it was.

And here I stand at a cross roads- a challenge for someone who&#39;s traveled down the same path for so long, with the same mentality.

Some Words on my Mind
<lj-cut text=""Some Words on my  Mind"">
Mi Corazon, Je t&#39;aime.

oh dear lover,
whisper sweet nothings
in my ear. As we embrace,
your hot breath causes cold chills
upon my spine.

oh my heart,
shaking from a skipped beat
surround me. As we dance,
your vibrant aura reaching out
to all of mine.

my only partner,
pining for the love
you promise. As we ache
with a pain, we placed upon
our own existance.

oh my sunshine,
gaze upon my yearning
to soak you in. As you stretch
your hands to touch
my very soul.

oh sweet release,
husky voice catching from
our connection. As we soar
together, if only
for a moment.

"event","&nbsp;&rarr; Comment with &quot;Come at me, bro&quot;
&rarr; I&#39;ll respond by asking you five questions so I can get to know you better.
&rarr; Update your journal with the answers to the questions.
&rarr; Include this explanation in the post and offer to ask other people questions.

<lj user=""bluelipgreeneye"" /> &nbsp;asked me some lovely and thought provoking questions.

1.why did you make an LJ account?

-Honestly I can&#39;t remember. I made one when I was in college. I think I was a little lonely, going from Alaska to California is a bit of a culture shock. I wasn&#39;t used to &#39;real life&#39; as it is in the states. I could never get used to it. People are untrustworthy, selfish and downright mean in the real world. (not everyone, but in the 5 years I lived there I had few friends, not because I was shy, but because I was picky. Who you choose to surround you in your life has a big impact on who you are and how you feel.) I&#39;ll take my Alaskan paradise over more sun, more money or more nightlife anytime.

2.how do you perceive yourself vs. how do others preceive you?

Shoot, there&#39;s a loaded question. I perceive myself as accepting, cautious (to the point of worrisome), and kind. I hold my tongue to guard others feelings, and stand up for those who won&#39;t stand up for themselves (love me an underdog). I always try to do my best and I KNOW that I&#39;m more naive than anything. I view the world through rose-colored glasses and that&#39;s the way I like it.

I can only guess how others perceive me or say what others have told me. An instance that really stands out in my mind is last Halloween. This girl was plastered. Like whooping and hollering (I never raise my voice outside of a sporting event), broke my favorite faux pearl necklace and got frisky with my husband in our hotel room while THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE 10 FEET AWAY. (ugh, talk about mortified the next day!!) I made a point to&nbsp;apologize&nbsp;to everyone (that I could remember!) that was in the room. They&#39;re response? They laughed it off, they said.... &quot;You&#39;ve always been the perfect one, the angel, no one could corrupt, it was nice to see you&#39;re human too&quot;
WTF? Me, an angel? Ha. I laughed back in their faces thinking it was a joke. Stone cold faces.. they were dead serious. Well surprise to me.
Another time I had a &#39;friend&#39; steal some of my&nbsp;deceased grandmothers jewelry to buy drugs. A quote from my other friend... &quot;How could you steal from Jessie, JESSIE! That&#39;s like stealing from a puppy!!&quot;
Um... ok. lol. So apparently my friends think I&#39;m a frail little cuddly person. Wrong again. I just keep my colors to myself and my husband. And I&#39;m ignorant to things like betrayal, I don&#39;t understand gluttony, and lust eludes me.

3.what is your favorite pair of shoes?

Any pair of nikes or jordans

4.what is the most rebellious thing that you&#39;ve ever done?

Oh boy. I don&#39;t really have much to tell for this one... I know I&#39;m boring. I snuck out a bunch right after I graduated from High school (I was in college, living with the rents) I even missed christmas morning one year because I fell asleep over my boyfriends house. Pretty much everything &quot;bad&quot; I did was with that boy.... interesting thought.

5.what is your first memory of?
First memory - Three years old. My half brothers were loading up their moms car. My Dad had just lost his rights to them and their mom came and took them away. &nbsp;They were 6 and 8. I didn&#39;t see either one again until I was 13. That demented woman ran them into the ground, the younger one managed to get away and join the army at 16 (that&#39;s when I saw him again) The older one ended up in jail for 6 years... and is still paying for that woman&#39;s choices. (Did I mention that I saw her at my brother&#39;s wedding a few years ago and she unabashedly hit on my husband in front of me for hours? She finally got the hint and went home with one of my brother&#39;s army buddies. Crazy alert.)"

Fresh back from vacation! Woot! Spent almost a week in Sutton, my whole bottom half is sore from constant 4wheelin adventures, but cannot WAIT to go back. This weekend the whole fam is heading for Homer for some commercial fishing. Course, I'll be holding down the camp with my good ole alaskan husky (who apparently LOVES camping, lol, didn't have her on a leash at all! So proud, my baby is growing up *sniffle*) Poor me you say? NOPE. Eff boats, don't much like boats (I won't mention the fact that I can't swim) because they float on water, and I hate water. Give me some ice over water&nbsp;any day.

Camping with no one but my hubby and my dog was just awesome. Nothing better than SILENCE (or just the sound of the 4wheel engine) We rode and Lilly chased, you want to see one happy husky, get her to run as fast as she can. lol. It was priceless, tongue hanging out, big shit eating grin, ears back, just beaming.
We camped right against the bottom of a mountain (a very steep one) and there was a huge rock about 100 feet up. Lilly climbed up to the rock and would lay there for hours 'watching over the camp'. Lol, I have the best dog ever. She also&nbsp;buried a bone, which I've never seen her do before, poor city-bound dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Guess I should bite back into my unfinished meme...

&nbsp;day 5 - discuss your feelings on the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; and the way it&rsquo;s used in today
I think love has many forms. For example I love sushi, I love my fam, I love my hubby, I love to read, I love sports... all in different ways. I use the word love to describe the things/people I hold close to my heart or would hate to live without. If I was suddenly paralyzed I would be&nbsp;devastated. Not because I couldn't walk or do other things, but because I couldn't skate, or slide into home, or dive for a frisbee. I def would pick up wheelchair hockey and anything else I could though... I guess I would be ok now that I think about it, I could feel the wind in my hair from the back of a rig (I hate running anyways) and play frisbee golf (I might not have a killer drive anymore but I could make it work.) ........well geez I've got way off track here.
The way the word is used today, sure people through it around who prob shouldn't, but that's just because they don't understand it. LOVE on those people because they need it the most.&nbsp;"

"event","Has it really been a week since I posted? Time flies.
Been busy this week, trying to pull a team for the &#39;Over the Chill&#39; tournie this weekend, but NOBODY likes to drive to Wasilla. Geez peeps, it&#39;s only a 45 min drive, that&#39;s nothing for the folk in the states (I would think).
Managed to pull enough players, but we are sans a goalie. That is def a road block. I&#39;d ask my dad... but the truth is.. he&#39;s pretty&nbsp;awful. I love him, and I love playing on a team with him, but this tournie is a lil more advanced than what he can hold up to. 

But hey, mad respect for Daddio, 53 years old and he decides that he wants to play hockey.. and be a goalie on top of that. So now the Mam wants to play. Heh. We are now a complete hockey family. All 3 brothers, lil sis, mam, dad, and my hubby all on the same team. Watch out!

Now for the meme that I&#39;ve been neglecting...
day 4 - your most significant childhood memory 

Woot, I have to choose one? Something that actually changed the course of my life eh? (Wouldn&#39;t that be super significant?! lol) Cause and effect and all that. Unfortunately, I have a horrible memory, I actually wrote my college thesis on the effects that emotional agitation has on your short term memory, therefore affecting the long term. So on a whole, males, (being less emotional) have better memories. Booboo on that jazz.

Back to the memory - It def would be a time when I was 10. My Mam and I were traveling to Hawaii and stopped in Cali to hit up Disneyland. (barely remember visiting Disneyland btw. Barely remember anything at all about the trip) Except meeting my cousin Andrew, who was 23 at the time. He was a newly successful&nbsp;architect, and he took us to see one of the houses that he designed.
I remember everything about that house. The arched entryways, the niches, the rounded corners (it was a new thing back then, very vogue) and wow, the landscaping. At ten, I decided what I wanted to do in life. And I stuck to it. At 17 I was in college for&nbsp;Architectural&nbsp;Engineering and Technology, at 20 I was graduating with my design degree and already had a position at a prestigious firm in Orange County.
Aannnnnd... at 22 I was having an early mid-life crisis, I quit my job, broke up with the boyfriend, and moved back to Alaska. Whew, sometimes you just need to LIVE. I was focused my entire young life on reaching my goal. After I got it, I didn&#39;t know what to do with myself, I had nothing more to strive to, I already crossed the finish line of my life before I even turned 21. 

I floundered for a year or so.. then enter hubby from stage right. I&#39;ve always had the &#39;sidekick&#39; mentality, little did I know all I needed was a hero so I could find myself again."

Where's my 12 foot stick so I can poke this subject...

I'm really not feeling long winded today, good thing my thoughts on religion are simple.

*I respect all beliefs
*I'm a Christian but don't believe a person is a sinner because of their sexual orientation, religious choices or pretty much any choice that has good intentions or isn't harmful to others.
*I believe the best way to draw people to your 'cause' if that's what you want to do, isn't door to door 'sales' but rather to live by example and let your light draw others in.
(not that I'm knocking door to door, you just might find that one person that needed that, and if 1 in a 100 is good enough for you, then dammit, it's good enough for me.)

"event","&nbsp;Day 2 -- My thoughts on Death.

Well isn&#39;t this a chipper topic when I&#39;m in SUCH a great mood 

Do I believe in an afterlife?&nbsp;Absolutely, I&#39;m a Christian and my beliefs follow such. But I&#39;m not a dweller, I focus more on life. Nothing really comes to an end, just takes on a different form of life. Celebrate the life you have, and no I don&#39;t mean you have to jump out of a plane everyday of the week to feel fulfilled. Me, I spend everyday trying to better myself in some way. You want to change the world? Start with yourself.

Hmmm... obviously I don&#39;t spend much time thinking about death. Really, what&#39;s the point? You can&#39;t stop it, you can&#39;t postpone it, you can&#39;t reject it. When it&#39;s time to go, it&#39;s time. Cosmos and all that.


In the words of Nick Swanson, &quot;WHY? Why does it have to be sad? Why can&#39;t we make it fun for the people who have to come to my funeral... <em>First</em>, I&#39;m going to have a closed casket... so that people will <em>think</em> that my body is in there, but.it.won&#39;t.be! I want to have my body rigged up with wires and swing over my family. DUDE, how sweet would that be? Then hit the lights and techo-music comes from everywhere~ It&#39;s a partay!&quot;"

Poo on the weekend being over. 2 days isn&#39;t near enough time to last me all week. He quit his job on the slope (which he loved) so he could work in town and we wouldn&#39;t have to do the whole long distance thing. He re-joined the union and guess what... they ship him up north for 2 months.
Poo on the union.

I have this hilarious photo of my dog climbing a 6 foot chain link fence today. But I&#39;m on my hubby&#39;s apple (i&#39;m a HP girl) and for the life of me can&#39;t figure it out.

Course that could be the mimosas talking..."

"event","Coming up on a crossroads is frightening.&nbsp;
We will be leaving Alaska in a few months (after one last amazing summer where the sun never sets) to follow his music. He's an amazing artist, will break your heart with his guitar, make you melt with his voice, and baffle you with his drumsticks. I never really thought of a drum set as a stand-alone instrument like a piano, but *dear Lord* he can make those skins purrr. I could listen to him play his bluesy drums for hours in perfect contentment, he has the&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to play directly out of his soul. It's amazing.&nbsp;
It'd be selfish of me to keep him all to myself. So we are moving to California or Texas to start and are going to follow the blues crowd. I would think that I'm bias (since I'm married to him after all) but wherever he plays.... he captivates people, moves some to tears. He has something special, this is what he was made for.

So HELLO adventure says the square!&nbsp;"

Epic fail on that part.&nbsp;<br />Heaven forbid I do something productive. I've bought 4 books on my kindle this past week alone. All by Amanda Hocking. Not a bad author, entertaining at least (see above 4 books, heh) Her books tend to just skim the surface of intensity, she never goes the extra step. Stopping right at civility so you can just barely glimpse excitement. It's frustrating actually, I keep expecting to break out of the mundane, so I keep reading... expecting... waiting.... hoping that she'll finally cross the line into amazing storytelling. She's so close.<br /><br />I'm going to lunch. I wonder what my dog has eaten today while I've been at work.<br /><br />On a bright note... one of my hockey teams won the state championship on Sunday- Woot woot!

"event","<b><br /></b><br /><lj-cut text=""Thank you"">Ack, ridiculous! I do have some free time on my hands though, and these&nbsp;questionnaires never cease to amuse.&nbsp;<br /><br />1. Where is the last place you held hands?<br />On an outdoor ice rink with my husband. He was trying to warm me up, lucky me got to stick my hands in his shirt. I think I'll feign cold spells more often...<br /><br />2. If you were drafted into the army would you survive?<br />Absolutely, I'm an army brat, it's in my blood. I'd most&nbsp;definitely prefer NOT to go to war because it would rub harshly against my feminine&nbsp;leniences, but to quote the popular &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; and baby, I'm fit.&nbsp;<br /><br />3. Do you sleep with the TV on?<br />Don't have a television in my room. The bedroom is to practice making babies. (You know, so when we decide to have some, we do it right ;)<br /><br />4. Have you ever drank milk straight out of the carton?<br />I have, but its kind of gross. Not that I'm a germaphobe, I'll eat off anyones plate, it's just that milk coagulates around the rim, and that's&nbsp;disgusting&nbsp;in your mouth.<br /><br />5. Have you ever won a spelling bee?<br />Nope. But I will mop up ANYONE in Words with Friends.&nbsp;<br /><br />6. What is your longest fight with one of your friends?<br />Ack, that would be... about a year and a half. A friend tried (not&nbsp;purposely&nbsp;I'm sure) to come between my husband and I. He was a mutual friend, and although he introduced us, he was not invited to our wedding. Sad actually, we're still working on mending the friendship.<br /><br />7. Are you a fast typer?<br />I'm on a computer close to 8 hours a day. Not to mention the iphone, ipad and kindle. You do the math (or visual as it were)<br /><br />8. Are you afraid of the dark?<br />Yup. I have an extremely overactive imagination, add in 'worry wort' syndrome and I'm a goner. My husband holds all the logic in our relationship, he keeps me grounded.<br /><br />9. Do you like someone right now?<br />Um, yes. See above&nbsp;responses.&nbsp;<br /><br />10. What ended your last relationship?<br />Can I remember that long? Oh right, Martin. Great guy,  he was a friend that I never really should have dated to begin with. We just weren't meant for&nbsp;each other&nbsp;in that way. Now we are not even friends anymore, which is really too bad.&nbsp;<br /><br />12. Do you knock on wood?<br />Yes. My favorite innuendo is knocking on the wood in my hubby's pants. heeheehee.<br /><br />13. Are you drinking anything right now?<br />Water.<br /><br />14. Do you think you're smart?<br />I'm a leo, of course I think I'm smart. In my own special way.&nbsp;<br /><br />15. Have you ever been in love?<br />Yes I have, and I am. My life revolves around love. Love my neighbor, Love my God, Love my husband.&nbsp;<br /><br />16. Do you miss someone right now?<br />Once someone is forever gone, you will forever miss them.&nbsp;<br /><br />17. What do you want for Christmas?<br />The rock my hubby just bought me this past Christmas. Can't wait to have it paid off!!!<br /><br />18. Do you know the muffin man?<br />Rhetorical&nbsp;question.<br /><br />19. Do you talk in your sleep?<br />How would I know this? I'm sleeping. I do however talk in my dreams, whether or not it is vocalized is a mystery to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />20. Do you remember your 1st crush?<br />Um. Not really. I remember early crushes but which is the first? Not sure.&nbsp;<br />I'll just say that I loved David Boreanaz and still do. Loved John Cena and still do. Loved Will Smith and still do. Guess I'm into long term crushes. Newest crush is John Mayer. (I share this crush will my hubby- who has a man-crush)<br /><br />21. Have you ever flown a kite?<br />Not many times but yes.<br /><br />22. When was the last time that you went swimming and where?<br />Actual swimming? Never, can't swim. But I do go splash around in the shallow end.... which would be the second weekend of January when we went to Alyeska Resort in Girdwood to celebrate my roommates birthday. Salt water pool &amp; 16 person whirlpool - divine.<br /><br />23. Do you consider yourself successful?<br />I've got a kick-ass job as a marketing coordinator, a home, a vehicle, an amazing partner... yeah, it pretty much shouts awesome.<br /><br />24. How many people are on your contact list of your cell phone?<br />Yeah,&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not counting that.<br /><br />25. Have you ever asked for a horse?<br />Allergic. But &nbsp;I would take one if offered. If I let my allergies get in my way, I'd never do anything. Since I'm allergic to like EVERYTHING!<br /><br />26. Plans for tomorrow?<br />Get up, make the hubby breakfast &amp; lunch, go to work, walk the dog, maybe read a bit of my book, play some pond to warm up for my game, then hockey game with the hubby, then I'm def going to get laid in the shower, and to bed.<br /><br />27. What did you do this past weekend?<br />House sat my parents dogs, drove to Girdwood and stayed in a cabin up in the mountains for the night, played some hockey and generally hung out with the hubby.<br /><br />28. Miss being at school right now?<br />Sure. School exercises the mind and you learn something new everyday, you don't even have to try- it's just handed to you. Wish I realized that when I was still in school.&nbsp;<br /><br />29. When's the last time you told someone you loved them?<br />today.<br /><br />30. Do you want to be single?<br />Hell no.<br /><br />31. Do you have a big penis?<br />I own a vagina.<br /><br />32. Who's your hero?<br />You're probably all snickering by now but my husband. He's amazingly talented in everything he does. I like to call him 'charmed'. Anything he touches, he easily masters. Any game he plays, he'll beat everyone, every time. He always makes the right&nbsp;decisions, even if it sounds crazy at the time. In the long run, he's right, every time. But he's not arrogant, &nbsp;and he manages to make everyone else in the room feel like they're 7 ft tall. Although he can be bossy and he's impossible to wake up - every hero has his kryptonite ;)<br />&nbsp;<br />33. Have you ever been suspended or expelled from school?<br />Nope, I'm an angel.&nbsp;<br /><br />34. What are you looking forward to?<br />Moving to Texas so my husband can&nbsp;pursue&nbsp;a music career.<br /><br />35. If you could be stranded with one person for 24 hours, who would it be?<br />Jeremiah<br /><br />37. Have you ever eaten dog food?<br />Um, no.<br /><br />38. Can you handle the truth?<br />YOU can't handle the truth!<br /><br />39. Do you like green eggs and ham?<br />Okay these questions are just getting more and more ridiculous.&nbsp;<br /><br />40. What 3 things do you always bring with you to places?<br />Iphone, shoes, ring<br /><br />41. Any cool scars?<br />Barely. I heal abnormally well.<br /><br />44. What's your deepest secret?<br />Don't really have any... maybe what a crazy person I was in college. None of the people that are a part of my life now are privy to that information. But if they asked, I'm not trying to hide anything.&nbsp;<br /><br />45. How often do you talk on the phone?<br />Not that much. I'm not really a talker. I prefer to text or social media.&nbsp;<br /><br />46. Do you believe in love?<br />Of course.<br /><br />47. Is there something you want that you can't have?<br />I want a house. an actual home. with a fucking picket fence. But I'll have to be patient. Let the young live!<br /><br />48. Four things about the preferred sex that you first notice?<br />Shoulders/back, the way they carry themselves and walk, eyes, smile.<br /><br />49. When was your last time you cried?<br />Pfft. When I was on my period. I don't even remember why, just that the world was fucking ending.<br /><br />50. Who did you last hug?<br />Jeremiah<br /><br />51. Do you get along with your family?<br />Yes. Although I still smack my lil bro around quite a bit (at 16 he's twice my size, but I still show him who's boss)<br /><br />52. Where is your phone?<br />Next to my mouse. On silent, because I'm at work.<br /><br />53. What was the last thing you ate?<br />Licorice.&nbsp;<br /><br />54. Favorite color?<br />Watermelon. That's pink and green for all you non-color-intelligent&nbsp;folk.<br /><br />55. Last movie you saw?<br />Social Network. I watched it completely against my will and grievously, I loved it. Great movie.<br /><br />56.What are you listening too?<br />John Mayer<br /><br />57. What do you want?<br />For my dog to stop being such a little bitch. Thank God she's only 8 months. There is still hope.&nbsp;<br /><br />58. Favorite car?<br />Old refurbished flair-side pick-ups.<br /><br />59. What T.V. show are you watching?<br />Chopped, I record every flipping show, and NO TALKING!<br /><br />60. Who was the last person you talked to on the phone?<br />A client. Since I'm at work, lol.&nbsp;</lj-cut><lj-cut text=""Thank you Sparkywolf :)""></lj-cut>"

You plan ahead, and are interested in beauty, design, outward appearance, and symmetry. 
You are a social person who likes to talk and meet others. 
You are diplomatic, objective, and live in the present. 
You are a talkative person, maybe even a busybody! 
You are self-confident and like to bring attention to yourself.

Before the Internet or the AIM
Before semi automatics and weed
Before playstation2 or X-bOX
Before the 5 hours of homework you put off every night...

..Way back...

I'm talkin' bout hide and go seek at dusk.
Red light, Green light.
Playing kickball & dodgeball until your porch light came on.
Mother May I?
Red Rover
four square
Hula Hoops
Running through the sprinkler
Happy Meals
Getting the privelage to sit in the front seat of the car

Wait...

Watchin' Saturday Morning cartoons
Like Hey Arnold and Doug
Recess
Or what about legends of the hidden temple, global guts, double dare, bloody mary and who, ARE YOU AFFRAID OF THE DARK!
Who could forget Snick
Or the teenage mutant ninja turtles, scooby doo, and Power Rangers,

Christmas morning...
Your first day of school
Bedtime Prayers and Goodnight Kisses
Climbing trees
Getting an ice cream off the ice cream truck (the real ice cream truck w/ cones & banana splits)
A million mosquito bites and sticky fingers
Jumpin' down the steps
Jumpin' on the bed
Pillow fights
Runnin' till you were out of breath

Laughing so hard that your stomach hurt and you almost peed your pants

Laughing so hard that you did pee your pants
Being tired from playin' all day
Your first crush...
Rainy days at school meant playing ""Heads down 7-Up"" & ""King chase the Queen"" in the classroom

Remember that?

I'm not finished yet...

Kool-Aid & Icee Cups was the drink of the summer
Giving your friends a ride on your handlebars or spokes
Wearing your new shoes on the first day of school
Class Field Trips
When nearly everyone's mom was at home when the kids got there.
When getting high was swinging on the swing-set
When $5 seemed like a million, and another dollar a Miracle.
When your parents took you to McDonalds and you were so cool.
When Toys r Us overuled the ""mall""

I want to go back to the time when...

Decisions were made by going ""eeny-meeny-miney-moe""
Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, ""do over!""
""Race issue"" meant arguing about who ran the fastest.
Money issues were handled by whoever was the banker in ""monopoly""
Catching fireflies could happily occupy an entire evening
It wasn't odd to have two or three ""best"" friends.
Saying cuss words were referred to the ""F, B or S - word"" or h-e double hockey sticks.
Being old, referred to anyone over 20.
The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was cooties.
The only real heart break you had was when your mom wouldnt buy you that new toy

Nobody was prettier than Mom

Nobody was cooler than Dad

Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better
It was a big deal to finally be tall enough to ride the ""big people"" rides at the amusement park.
Getting an inch of snow was a dream come true.
Abilities were discovered because of a ""double-dog-dare""
Spinning around, getting dizzy and falling down was cause for giggles.

If you can remember most or all of these, then you have LIVED!!!


Pass this on to anyone who may need a break from their ""grown up"" life...

I double dog dare you."

The sun touches my face about 6 in the morning,
and I sigh, because tuesdays are most boring.
But then I'm relieved, and shout with glee,
'cuz I'm thinking my net friends have written to me!
So out of my bed I spring with a passion,
and throw on some clothes in no particular fashion.
And then I'm quickly out the door in a run,
shouting all the while; ""Livejournal, here I come!""
Icons, communities, pictures and more,
pop up on my screen as if a chore.
""Hurry up!"" I yell at the childish flag,
""Don't wave at me and quit that lag!""
My foot taps a bit and I squirm in my seat,
god I hate apples, they are such dead beats!
Then all of the sudden it's up and running,
god I love apples, they are so cunning!
I quickly log in, and hit my friends link,
and then my heart soars, and then my heart sinks.
Because since I was on just an hour ago,
nobody has written it proves to show.
So I stagger slowly back to my room,
hidden in a shroud of gloom.
I climb into bed with sad thoughts in my head,
and look at my clock with a mind full of dread.
But oh wait! You see! It's now 6:03!
Surely someone has written to me!
So out of my bed, I jump once again,
and run to the lab that I was just in.
Logging on is quick, which is just swell,
(for this time, I used a Dell)
I'm back to my page, what a livejournal whore!
I've got messages from freddy, Em and more!
disgustipated is flowing with themes and bitches,
just waiting to chat over roast beef sandwhiches. 
So I'll sit in this chair and work out all day,
these knuckles so fit, I keep bullies at bay. 
So yah for livejournal, and the friends that we make,
It gives a life for goodness sake!"

on the houses and the boulivards
and the sidewalk begger tells ""it's like a dream""
with the roar of cars
and the lulling of the cafe bars, 
the sweetly sleeping sweeping of the seine. 
lord, i don't know if i'll ever be back again.</i>

passed state pool imspection with flying colours.  w00t.  and my computer got shipped early so i get it by thrus or so.  w00t^2

anyway, have to go back to work.  not so much fun.  headache from the sun.  i want to just sit here and listen to music"

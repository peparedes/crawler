"event","ok so ill go in order about the stuff that happened yesterday, what happened today, and what hopefully will happen tomorrow.

yesterday= i went to the libary and decided i'd climb (along with heather) on the hood of our friend amanda's car.
i fell.
i landed on my arm, and partly on my hip.
my pinky finger might be broken acording to my health teacher.
my hip is bruised badly, but im kinda better.
we all laughed it off and went to get pizza after i fell.
hehe.
i have such loving friends.

today=

then i came home and sat around and waited till...
the <b>concert</b> yay!
i went to the concert.
there was alot of great bands there.
<b>for all we know
tears for juliet
moorland
second hand

</b>
those where the great bands i got to band my head violently to.
sweat till my shirt was soked.
and scream till my voice was gone to.
and right now im extremly hyper and crazy from the band.
ps. also i won a <b>tears for juliet</b> teeshirt...well didnt really win it.
the guy screamed 'who wants a free t-shirt' and me being the loud person i am start jumping up and down screaming ME ME ME ME.
so he threw it to me...hehe.

tomorrow=
<b>prom</b> yes prom prom prom...tomorrow is prom.
but before i can go to prom i have to get up really urly in the morning to go get xrays on my hand to see if my pinky is broken from the fall that happened the day before yesterday...

wait till 5:00pm.
then alyssa will pick me up at my house.
we will drive to her house and eat dinner (chicken cordon blue)idk if that's how u spell it.
after that we will drive to the mall.
my friend alyssa will buy a pair of flip flops that she wants sooo badly.
we will go to prom.
i dont know what will happen at prom.

"event","hi every one who's reading this. im new to live journal, actually i dont even know why i started an account. i think i just want a place where i can whine about all the things that are fucked up in this world and maybe just maybe if im lucky i'll find some people that agree with me...im in a ""rebellious"" mood and im just thinking about all the stuff that's really messed up like damn steriotypes, qulickes, homophobia, and lables, hypocrites!...idk i guess this is all just really getting to me living in such a small town i kinda deal with this stuff every day!...idk im just whining again but maybe i'll post some of the stuff that's bothering me specifically and u can tell me if it bothers u too!"

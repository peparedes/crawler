Right now I'm working out my summer plans, which may amount to my taking an arts-related internship in Detroit and going wild with the Wayne State kids.  I'm really hoping it works out!  The Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit wants to interview me next week, which is awesome, and I'm currently going back and forth with the research library at the DIA.  We'll see what happens...  I think working for CAID would be amazing.  It would require that I get a part-time, paid job, but that's okay because the university always needs people for secretarial positions and god knows I'm qualified enough.

Other than that, everyone should go out and buy the new Machine Head and new Blackfield albums.  I love both bands, so do it!"

Warn you once to turn away 
Here it's December, everyday 
Press your lips to the sculptures 
And surely you'll stay (Love like winter) 
Fire, sugar, and ice I am made, I am made 

It's in the blood, it's in the blood 
I met my love, before I was born 
He wanted love, I taste the blood 
He bit my lip, and drank my warmth 
From years before, from years before 

She attails the mirror lace, 
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday) 
With the lines in the mirror, through the lipstick trace 
She said, It seems you're somewhere, far away 
To his place 

It's in the blood, it's in the blood 
I met my love, before I was born 
She wanted love, I taste the blood 
She bit my lip, and drank my warmth 
From years before, from years before 

Love like winter Oh Oh 
Love like winter Winter 3 4 

It's in the blood, it's in the blood 
I met my love, before I was born 
He wanted love, I taste the blood 
He bit my lip, and drank my warmth

Sleeping a lot and eating too much...very unlike school: sleeping a lot and drinking too much :o)  Anyway, I've spent a good deal of quality time with the family.  I went hiking with my brothers at Mt Diablo the Monday after I got here, and I've been out shopping more times than I can count.  And of course Christmas was lovely.  

On the non-familial front, I got coffee with Kristi and Danielle last week, which was nice.  It was so good to catch up with both of them!  The following Friday was Cindy's boyfriend's birthday, so I went with Kristi (yeah, I had never met the guy, but I really wanted to see Cindy and Penka again!).  It was a very good time--lots of dancing and quite a bit of vodka.  Much fun :)

I'm missing Zane like crazy.  This is the longest we've ever been apart.  I hate it.  He's picking me up from the airport on the 3rd, but somehow that still feels very far away.  I should probably make plans to go out and have some fun one of these nights...otherwise I'll start moping."

My weekend was lovely, and I'll leave it at that.  Now I'm just doing work and emailing information schools (trying to see who will let me apply to both the ischool -and- the masters program in folklore).  It's been a very nice, lazy Sunday, and I've read a great deal of Freud (Totem & Taboo).

For anyone who's curious, the new-ish Stone Sour CD is ridiculously awesome.  You should all buy it.  Sooo good.  There also happen to be two super pretty ballads on it.  Weird to think this thing came from the mind of a Slipknot member.  Huh.

Anyway, Zane is coming out to Ann Arbor tonight to watch movies and snuggle.  I rented three flicks to pick from: Dog Day Afternoon (young Al...'nuff said), Fargo (just in case he hasn't already seen it), and Brazil (one of my all-time favorites).  I suppose it isn't a terribly romantic selection, but they're all really fucking good movies.  At any rate, I'm looking forward to it.  I know I saw him last weekend, but let's face it: I miss the kid...

Saturday Sandra and I will probably hang out.  I think she has a few juicy things to discuss.  And there may be bourbon involved.  Yeah, that makes us feel pretty manly.

School of Information, how I adore thee!  Loved the event last weekend.  Totally think I want to pursue an MLIS concentration in Archives & Records Management.  Joy!  I would love to combine it with a masters in folklore and public culture, but that's a relatively narrow field that only a few schools offer (among them UT - Austin, which also has the top-ranked ARM program in the country)...  My future is starting to make...sense.  Weird, huh?

The King's crossing was the main attraction 
Dominoes falling in a chain reaction 
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me 
Whiskey works better than beer 
The judge is on vinyl, decisions aren't final 
And nobody gets a reprieve 
And every wave is tidal 
If you hang around you're going to get wet 
I can't prepare for death any more than I already have 
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy, that's why it sells

Frustrated fireworks inside your head 
Are going to stand and deliver dark instead 
The method acting that pays my bills 
Keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills 
I got a heavy metal mouth, it hurls obscenity 
And I get my check from the trash treasury 
Because I took my own insides out 

It don't matter cause I have no sex life 
And all I wanna do now is inject my ex wife 
I've seen the movie
And I know what happens 
It's Christmas time 
And the needle's on the tree 
A skinny Santa is bringing something to me 
His voice is overwhelming 
But his speech is slurred 
And I only understand every other word 

Open your parachute and grab your gun 
Float down like an omen, a setting sun 
Read the part and return at five 
It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive 
But I don't care if I fuck up 
I'm going on a date 
With a rich white lady 
Ain't life great? 
Gi'me one good reason not to do it
(Because We love you)
So do it.

This is the place where time reverses 
And dead men talk to all the pretty nurses 
Instruments shine on a silver tray

Here's hoping there's a good turn out Friday.  Thursday night Carly and I are going shopping at the Russian store, and by then we'll know pretty much who's coming.  Okay, gotta go do Russian homework now."

"event","Hey now...LJ has a new sexy look.  How 'bout that?

So I thought I'd get around to writing up the Chicago trip sooner than this, and now I just feel like telling the basic stuff.  First off, we went to visit Rishi and his friend Troy.  Carly, Peter (her stepbro), and I drove down to the city for like 8 hours Friday night, seeing as traffic was ridiculous and we got detoured off 94.  And it was...actually kinda fun.  We blasted music and Carly and I became generally riotous.  Anyway, once there we went out to Greektown at like 11 and got food.  We did a minor amount of walking, but those of us who had spent the last century in the car were pretty beat.  

The next day we went to Lakeview and then drove through downtown Chicago.  God, that city is beautiful...I really like it a lot.  It's way more chill than San Francisco, kind of midwest without being overly so.  I was a big fan of going across the river and down the Magnificent Mile.  It was awesome.  That night we celebrated my birthday and Peter's (which is 5 days after mine).  Needless to say, it was ridiculously fun.  We all watched Garden State, Troy and his girlfriend cooked dinner, and then we proceeded to hang out on the balcony.  Carly and I also took Rishi and Peter on two walks during which we did an embarassing drunk girl stumble through the (less urban) streets of Chicago :P  And, since we still had some intense girl talk that needed to come out, we had a nice time camping out in the car after everyone else had gone to bed.  Good times.

The next day we pretty much got up, ate breakfast at Dunkin' Donuts, and said our goodbyes.  The car ride home was sad (so sad that we played Dashboard Confessional and I was totally...gulp...into it).

Anyway, that's that.  We're hoping to visit again sometime this semester.  And I miss Rishi a lot, so we seriously need to get back."

But no matter.  Classes start Tuesday!  And I can't wait to see everyone again!!  For now, though, I'm going to spend some nice quality time with the parents (Dad and I are going to the Orinda movie theater this afternoon to watch The Illusionist and then we're getting Mom and going out for dinner).

"event","So this weekend was a whole lot of fun.  We left relatively early Saturday morning and got to Santa Cruz around noon.  We wandered through the UCSC campus and all agreed that it's a very pretty place.  Anyway, then we hit up Emily's on Mission Street for lunch.  I love that little joint--the pastries are yummy and the outside seating is adorable.  The rest of the day & night were spent at the boardwalk with all day passes.  Dad had us ride the Cave Train a couple of times, which was fun because that's probably my favorite ride there.  Adam and I also decided to eat deep-fried twinkies as a joke (we each choked down one) and were quite amused that some people bought them...well...-not- as a joke.  Huh.

The next day we did the Felton-SC train, which is lovely.  There were so many cute little children on that train!  Oh my god!  At Roaring Camp we hiked around a bit before the train returned to take us back to the boardwalk.  After that we did some more hiking, got dinner at this yummy Italian place downtown, and headed home to the Cord.  Adam and I stayed up late to mix white russians and watch Barton Fink.  Good times :P

Today I think I'm heading out to Berkeley to shop around and hang out. I haven't been there all summer so I need to fit in at least one trip..."

This was, without a doubt, the best job I've ever had--I love the place and the people, and I'll miss both.

Tomorrow the fam and I are heading for a short but hopefully relaxing trip to Santa Cruz.  Adam really wants to walk around UCSC (mostly to make fun of people, I think).  We're also doing the boardwalk and...the train!  Woo!  The one that does the loop from SC to Felton.  God I love trains.  And our place has a view of the ocean and a balcony.  I'm really looking forward to it.

In other news, I've got this next slightly-more-than-a-week off to get ready for the big U-M and relax.  Should be nice :)"

"event","So, SOTU was awesome!  We started the day off pretty early, hitting up IHOP and then driving down to the Shoreline while busting pretty loud metal the whole way.  Anyway, apart from getting a bit crushed during Gwar, everything was great.  Of course my favorite band there was In Flames, but both Trivium and Machine Head rocked pretty hard too.  No one got sunburned either!  Three cheers for SPF 50.  I took pictures, but haven't developed them yet.  While I missed seeing Eric in the pit, I did manage to get a pic of Aaron looking wonderfully pissed off while moshing.  Hopefully it comes out.  Loads of fun.

Today I went with the parents to the Legion of Honor to check out the big Monet exhibit going on there.  It's really very impressive, so if anyone hasn't gotten out yet, you really should.  Kind of a ""once in a lifetime"" sort of deal (my mom had us go through four times).  We had a very nice time, but when we got back home around 6 I promptly fell asleep for three hours.  Yikes!  Very solid nap though--I didn't wake up once!   

Tomorrow should be pretty loungy, which is good, cuz I'm relatively tired.  I'll probably go see Little Miss Sunshine with my mom.  I really want to see it, and the two of us thoroughly enjoy anything dealing with a dysfunctional family.  Gee, what should that tell us about ourselves?

Okay, so that's that.  All's well.  And, since I'm super lame, I think I'm just going to go read a little and go to bed.  There has been talk of blueberry pancakes tomorrow morning :)"

"event","...and that's gotta be a romping good time, huh?  Yes, Sounds of the Underground is this Saturday, and I'm very much excited.  Eric and I are piling into Aaron's car with Nick and two dudes I don't know from Benicia (one of them went to a Primus show with us over a year ago, but I honestly can't remember his name or what he looked like).  Anyway, Aaron and Eric have divised a plan for me to get a CD signed by Cannibal Corpse, which might be just a little bit scary.  In preparation for the big day, Mom and I went out shopping last night and bought a pair of sunglasses for $10 and a new pair of black athletic shorts (one of the bands squirts fake blood on the audience so I need to wear all black to this thing, but also be super comfy in the process).  The shorts have...(wait for it)...-built in underwear-.  Snap.

So...last Saturday was much fun-ness, what with the escaping of the severe heat with Shawna, her parents, and their very old labrador, Maggie.  We drove out to the woods and then to Pnt Reyes, which, needless to say, was lovely.  Got some sun, too.  Then we got dinner at a nice little place along the water where I ate grapes flambe (they were done with cognac and peppercorns--sooo good!).  The musical act for the night was a sadly off-key and rather timid cowboy-like fellow, who attempted to do ""Walk the Line"" and made me laugh a whole lot.  Oh yeah, and the drive was really pretty too.  Good times :)

Okay, so Eric and Aaron are in the kitchen eating a whole crapload of tacos, but when they finish we're all supposed to watch a shitty horror movie.  Hopefully they'll be done soon, cuz I'm about ready to fall asleep.  I've conked out during the last two or three movies we've all watched together, so I'd rather stay awake tonight.  And hey, tomorrow's Friday (woo!)."

I still found great stuff, but this time around we decided to be...um...more ambitious.

Also saw Superman, The Devil Wears Prada, and The Lake House (on different nights of course) and enjoyed all three.  So I've been hanging out and working a whole lot.  Still having a great time with the SFMOMA.  Plus, we just got our first male intern (there are about 25 women and no guys--eesh!).  His name is Marco and he just flew in from Italy.  Oh yeah--and he's beautiful.  And I mean like gorgeous.  Should make brown bag lectures every Thursday just a little bit more interesting **purrs**.  Anyway, I suppose that's it.

Not much is going on but prepping for my final and my departure.  I need to clean the apartment, do laundry, and pack like an SOB this weekend.  Sunday night Lauren and Carly are coming over for essentially our last hangout and exam preparation.  So I need to scrub the toilet before then.  Tomorrow's my last day at work until September, and I'm really ready to start up new stuff at the SFMOMA.

"event","First: DUDE, Shawna, when are you going to be home from D-land?  We need to hang out :)

Second: Last night was awesome.  I went over to Carly's with Rishi after work.  The three of us got produce and, get this, -heavy whipping cream- (mmm...) to make palak paneer.  We had a bottle of Georgian wine left over from last weekend's Russian store trip, Rishi brought naan and lots of spices and we totally went to town.  Took like 2 1/2 hours to get the whole feast finished, but in the end it was ridiculously good.

After dinner, we set out for Rishi's brother's band's show at the drummer's house.  I was completely picturing the typical house party, but as it turned out, the drummer is an econ professor at UM!  The house was fucking beautiful!  Carly and I were totally shocked and awkward for like the first half hour.  Rishi's bro is a med student, so the thing started really early (@ like 8:30) because he had to work a shift at an ER in Detroit later that night.  Anyway, the other two kids in the band were both grad students as well, and the entire crowd at the event was grad students, professors, friends of the professors, and professors' kids and wives.  I kept thinking I was going to run into one of my profs or something.  They had this nice spread of fruit, cut up veggies, expensive alcohol (translate: brands of beer I was not aware existed), and very yummy sangria.  Not at all what I expected.  Anyway, we had a lot of fun listening to the band (called S Apostrophe).  I thought they sounded great, and the professor was adorable (he looked like he was having so much fun!).  Check 'em out: http://www.myspace.com/sapostrophe.  Good stuff.

The rest of the night was taken up by lounging around and watching a weird Russian movie till 4.  Lots of fun.

And now I should actually do some work for Russian.  I've been ultra lazy today.  I'm sooo ready for summer!!!  I got an email from one of the women who interviewed me at SFMOMA about my orientation and this brown bag lunch/walk-through of the new Barney exhibit on the Thursday after I get back.  I'm so hyped for that job!  Eee!  Mom and I are going shopping that Wednesday to get a hot outfit for my first unofficial day.  And then shoes at Nordstroms.  Lots and lots of shoes."

"event","Wow.  I'm lazy.  I haven't updated in like a week and a half.

Actually, what with the chaos of moving into my new apartment (which I love, by the way), I'm hoping my LJ absence is excusable.  Last week I started Intensive Third Year Russian (woo!) which is indeed difficult, but also very fun.  There are only four other people in the class, two of whom I know from previous Russian classes.  They're all cool people (although there is one grad student in there who's sort of impressed with herself, but she's a relatively nice girl, so what the hell).  Anyway, I have to say that I'm enjoying it, even though there's a great deal of work to be done for the class.  Ann Arbor in the summer months is lovely.  It's quieter, true, but people also seem happier in general, you know?  I think it must be the sun.  During the summer you also get all the street-event type stuff: farmer's markets, art shows, etc.  In fact, tomorrow (through the fourteenth) the Ann Arbor Book Festival is going to be on State Street!  Eee!  I love this kind of thing, and this festival sounds particularly awesome.  There are going to be some related lectures, and I plan on attending one next weekend.  I love the bustle and artistic energy.  The books don't hurt either :)

All right.  Well, I have to go get ready for class.  In intensive Russian we've got two instructors who switch off every week.  Yesterday we had the same woman as last week because the guy teacher was defending his dissertation on Sunday and needed Monday to crash.  What this amounts to is that, essentially, I've got a new teacher today.  This feels sort of weird, since I was just starting to adapt to the old in-class schedule and all.  Here's hoping the second teacher is as nice as the first."

"event","...kinda.  Only less funny.  And with more pain.  Okay: so I was signed up to return my refridgerator to the maintenence office at nine o'clock this morning.  I got the wheely thing (is it a dolly?)  and was successfully moving my defrosted, clean fridge out of my room and onto the elevator.  Well, lo and behold, the cord got stuck in the elevator door, and, before I could do much of anything but cry out in fear, the whole fucking refridgerator did an aerial summersault.  When I got down to the basement the thing was upside down.  I think the fridge and dolly may have got me too, 'cause I'm a bit sore in spots now.  And that's the completely unexaggerated version.  In the version I plan on telling my family, I think the fridge will actually be hanging from the elevator door and then will fall on me when I reach the basement.  After all, there's a pretty decent chance that my ass is going to get fined for damages (the cord just severed, and the fridge got pretty jostled), so playing it up for the sake of laughs/pity/sympathy seems like a good enough plan.

Other than that, moving my boxes over to Maynard House (aka my new apartment building) went pretty smoothely, although I'm still going to have to lug a box with my tv and a few other miscellanous items to the hotel this weekend.  Haven't been able to get in touch with the parents to tell them yet."

"event","Finished my American lit term paper last night, and tomorrow morning I'll turn it in and have my Russian final.  I'm so unbelievably burnt out, and I'm sure the food poisoning I've had since Wednesday hasn't helped.  At any rate, I've got one more paper (well-researched but still looming) to finish in the next couple of days.  I just want this semester to be over so that I can move into my new apartment and have a couple of days to, you know, -not- do schoolwork.  And I want to read some of the books I've been waiting to dig into all year.  I think I'll start with some Stephen King.  Hehe :)  Anyway, the parents arrive at the end of the week.  I'm just trying to focus on the next couple of days."

"event","A poem about sailing and Milan Kundera.  I find it appropriate for a sailing blog on hiatus while I'm in Prague.

Mr. Milan Kundera, I want you to narrate my life.
Damnit, ignore those other insignificant wretches.
They're not even real!

You just made them up.
Why don't you just make me up instead?
Hell, at least I'd thank you for the trouble.

You could say that I'm brilliant.
You would point out what relationships I've acknowledged.
Explain my neruoses
In terms of my upbringing.

I'd be curious.  Conflicted.  Artistic.
You'd have compassion for me;
Unflinchingly you would describe my arrogance.
You'd describe the bad with the good.
That's ok.  I am courageous.  I will submit to piercing introspection calmly.

You would write this book,
Then I would take the book,
  (I imagine it leatherbound and old fashioned),
And go sailing with one hundred pounds of marijuana stowed away.

I'd read it in various stages of highness and soberness,
   depression and elation, lightness and heaviness, gratefulness and scornfulness.
Eventually I would need stronger drugs (of course).

I'd stop in an old jungle port.
In the story it would be described by its brilliant choking yellow dust and sand,
   which would contrast with the lush vegetation.
(I guess you'd do that port more justice than I am)

I'd find a place that still uses wooden packing crates stamped with red ink
And tied with twine.
No aluminum shipping containers for me.
It would be something out of Indiana Jones.  Something out of Rudyard Kipling.

Then I would solicit dingy, pitiless locals with my american dolares
Purchase ""marijuanas"", ""some speeds"", ""cocaines""
And sail around a little more."

"event","<P>Today was the nastiest work I've done yet.&nbsp; I literally foundered around in rotted mud and industrial lubricant for three hours, trying to figure out how to extract said gunk from the aft berths, which are extremely tight and hard to reach spaces.&nbsp; Especially right now, because we had to take off the rotted engine cover, which is supposed to be the stepping place to get to the berths.&nbsp; Still, cleaning is going well, as we improve our technique and figure out what we can do to make some headway.&nbsp; Personally I want to rip out the engine, the stove, the table, and cabinets before we continue, though.</P>
<P>I love finding little items from the past as I sort through the grime.&nbsp; When I find one it serves as an aid for my improvised game of imaging where this boat has been.&nbsp; I imagine where these items were sitting on the shelves when Mr. Musick's best salty tales were transpiring.&nbsp; (This rusted zippo lighter was <EM>here</EM> when the pirates chased the ship to Bangkok.&nbsp; I bet this broken latern was lost during the&nbsp;typhoon they hit in 1975, the one with the 40 foot swells which lasted 14 hours).&nbsp; I am able to find a certain continuity with the past out there on the Manukura.&nbsp; A continuity which is difficult to find in the post modern world.&nbsp; In fact, the post modern phenomenon is, partially, that it <EM>cannot</EM> be continuous with the past.&nbsp; It's a discontinuity in the social psyche.&nbsp; I'm not bringing the past to the future with this boat, but bringing the future to the past,&nbsp; and so am able to avoid the trap.&nbsp; But I fear that the only way to really find some serenity is to sail out with others who are as lost at sea as I am, others who are <EM>intelligent enough </EM>to be lost at sea with me.&nbsp; The post modern solution is to be lost at sea together.&nbsp; In that way I will bring the time traveler's capsule back into the present and be able to advance the cause of human suffering and joy in the present, and not waste time covering old ground.&nbsp; Besides, bananas taste better when you get them fresh from the market in Venezuela than they do in our whitewashed, safety conscious supermarkets.</P>"

"event","I got there around 4:30 today.  All I did was unscrew the hinges off the forward doors and muck around in the bilge.  Then we took off the mainsail and scrabbed wasps' nests and mud daubers off the boom.  Nasty work today.  Tomorrow is cleaning, and I want to take all the salvage off the boat and clean it off so I can get down to some serious cleaning in the cabin.  Going to need beer.  Lots of beer.  

Side note: we're going to have to insert some foam core into the cabin's roof because the ventilation is bad and there's about 12 gallons of condensation on it.
Side side note: I need mechanic's set man"

"event","Quick update.&nbsp; Today we finished scrubbing the deck of algae.&nbsp; Alex came out and we started, once again, on our hands and knees with stiff brushes and Comet (actually, we were primarily using Comet-like stuff called Bar Keep's Friend, which is a really dumb name).&nbsp; After about an hour of scrubbing Alex mentioned that his stepdad has a pressure washer.&nbsp; I called Mr. Musick and he didn't want me to use it unless he was there, for fear of stripping the fiberglass I guess.&nbsp; Weeeeeeeeeeeeelll...we're <EM>going to sand it anyway!&nbsp; </EM>I went and got the pressure washer and proceeded to finish the boat in a&nbsp;day, whereas by hand it would have taken a week and been an inferior job.&nbsp; I hope Mr. M isn't pissed.<BR>Moral of the story:<BR>1.&nbsp; Embrace technology!&nbsp; Technology is good and saves time!<BR>2.&nbsp; If it's your ass that's doing the work it's a lot easier for someone else to suggest a harder job.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>Tomorrow is a day off.&nbsp; Next order of business is salvaging in the cabin and taking off the Dacron mainsail.&nbsp; Pictures to come soon."

"event","<P>We got the idea on Saturday, May 14, 2005, walking on the beach behind my house.&nbsp; That night we were sitting in the breezeway of Whitley's parents' friend's beachhouse, proposing it to his dad.&nbsp; I've never seen eyes light up so completely.&nbsp; From one dull, ordinary sentence - I think it was something about cancer - to the next, a new hope had awakened in him,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the stories started pouring forth.&nbsp; The next day we were out looking at her: The Manukura.&nbsp; It means ""red bird"" or ""flashy bird."" It is the name of Richard Musick's 32'6"" 1962 Islander 32 sloop.&nbsp; In the 1970's he logged nearly 12,000 nautical miles with it on a personal oddessey which took him from California to Thailand and all around the Pacific.&nbsp; She hasn't sailed in more than 21 years, not since Whitley, my friend, was born.&nbsp; But soon, soon the sails will fly again. The phoenix will arise!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't look like much right now, however. Almost entirely covered in several millimeters of grey algae on the deck, holes in the sail cover, lines green with slime.&nbsp; I shudder to think of how much osmotic blistering we'll see when we outhaul her.&nbsp; In 1962 they didn't even know that wet fiberglass blisters and they&nbsp;certainly weren't&nbsp;using the proper resins.&nbsp; But, as Mr. Musick pointed out many times, ""they don't build em like they used.""&nbsp; In the 1960s,when fiberglass was still a new and exotic hull material, nobody realized quite how strong it was, and boats of that era tend to be overbuilt.&nbsp; Mr. Musick assures me that the hull at the keel is at least four inches thick, nearly twice as thick as today's boats.&nbsp; I doubt the blisters will result in structural damage: she's a real tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday was just to be a preliminary survey - trying to comprehend the best place to begin her transformation.&nbsp; As the salty proprietor of the small marina where she's berthed commented: ""Hah...ye have a job of work there!""&nbsp; We walked her length while Mr. Musick pointed out where everything used to be.&nbsp; There were no guardrails; we grasped the stays and leaned towards the transom as we walked for fear of slipping on the grime.&nbsp; The cabin was worse.&nbsp; It could have been a recently raised sunken ship from the grand age of navigation. Everything in it will have to be ripped out and replaced, from the head to the bilge pump to the stove to the furniture.&nbsp; We agreed to start today with a thorough scrubbing, but only Mr. Musick and myself could attend; Whitley had work obligations.&nbsp; We made good headway today, finishing more than a third of the boat in about five hours.&nbsp; With a refined technique and all of the necessary equipment in order now, I confident that tomorrow we'll finish the initial cleanup.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This all happened so fast that I hadn't really had time to consider what it is that we are undertaking.&nbsp; Mr. Musick and I barely talked for the five hours that we diligently scrubbed today.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, as we were stowing our gear in the hold for the night, I had time for some reflection.&nbsp; As I stood in the grimy cockpit hoisting the refuse he handed up to me, I&nbsp;was watching&nbsp;him rummage.&nbsp; Occasionally he would pick up a rotted black shape and concentrate on it for several moments or even minutes.&nbsp; He wasn't really there in that ancient, dim, musty cabin full of wood so rotten that it stank.&nbsp; ""Ah, this used to be an ashtray made of coconut wood!""&nbsp; ""This was part of the old dodger assembly....""&nbsp; ""T88 glue"" (What is T88 glue?)<BR>""You know what this is?"" <BR>""No...a gasket?""<BR>""Masking tape.""&nbsp; Toss.<BR>""Well, it used to be, anyway.""<BR>""Yes....used to."" (Quiet reflection ensues)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was even buried treasure: we found some stainless steel and bronze nuts and screws which retained their shine, though they've been submersed in seawater for 23-odd years.&nbsp; I never really appreciated the quality of <EM>untarnishability</EM> so much as today.&nbsp; Seeing them gleam in that pile of muck literally set my heart pattering - I thought of bald eagles and brilliant sunsets and courage under fire.&nbsp; The Alamo (I remember!).<BR>&nbsp;Old age is the shrinking of possibility.&nbsp; 3 years old is the time to start gymnastics; starting much later will be a lifelong disadvantage.&nbsp; 11 to 12 is the cutoff to be a native speaker of any language.&nbsp; When you're 15, picking up a guitar and starting a band is an option, but that becomes harder in the next five years. When you're 20 years old, time is still on your side: if you want to take two years to restore a sailboat, you can do that.&nbsp; If you want to take another two years to sail it, you just might be able to swing it.&nbsp; When you're 60 and your back's out, there are few possibilities left.&nbsp; Most of them involve the youth.&nbsp; Make no mistake about it: this is an unspoken, unacknowledged contract: he will be the old and I will be the new.&nbsp; He will be my possibility, but I must be his.&nbsp; I have no intention of failing my end of the bargain: I will take advantage of my time to give him what he doesn't have: My youth and my youthful freedom, unfettered by the responsibilities of providing and subsisting which so soon will fall to me.&nbsp; Therefore I must retire for tonight, because I have a long day of youthful algae scrubbing ahead of me!</P>"

"event","A couple of days ago, I once again felt a little contemplative. What is it about love that makes people go blind? yeah yeah yeah, it's same old bullshit. But it's true. Intelligent individuals become incredibly >stupid< u kno' dang rayt Wut Am tawkn' bout... Well a really dear friend of mine just totally got me all shaken up. She had this obscure>>> but still great relationship with this guy from a different continent that she had met from the internet... now this was for four years.. the guy proposed and she said yes... Ok throughout relationships, couples go through some rough seas and some turbulent storms and some trust is spilt here and tere and then with love immediately regained back... now there was this giant lie that just ruined the both of them.. that guy has a son.. yeah yeah like u know what ur thinkin' this guy has done all the lies and reasoning and excuses blah blah to cover his caught ass up!!! but luckily this intelligent friend of mine, who may I proudly say a valedictorian and a cumlaude accrdng to her excellent history... Well, she ripped her gown and shredded it into pieces. All the little wedding giveaways are all thrown out somewhere and her shoes>>> the shoes!!! given away too. All she has left is her four years of memories with this guy she almost spent her life with and her strong heart to keep her decisions firm!!! This guy on the other hand, thinks that they're still engaged.. like he could sway her via EMAIL.. and yes there are women who bites that crap but she's not that stooooppiidd mister. obviously he's in denial about this whole situation... I know she'll make it through.. for now we gotta get her out of that forest and take her here where ppl can actually watch her... She needs to get away from this crazy guy who for all we know might be a freaking convict in his country.. for all I care... many ppl are marrying for the PAPERS now adays.. how is he any different... love is still too blind.. she was blind for a long tym but finally she opened up her fucking eyes and finally realized that he's not worthy enough of her preciousness. 

just a breather!

So I am settling for nursing right now... however, my options are still open for PA and heatlh science... it all depends on whether or not I get into SB's nursing school. Otherwise, I'll b considering other schools.
Actually this dec. things flipped the other way around, I was the one who told my 'rents that's it's ok for me to study in the Phil... then they were the ones who just said ""NO""... With a little more thinking, you can't really be cheap on education.
<img src=""http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/1053803/189215"" width=""519"" height=""749"">
As of now, I'm occupied mainly with studies, ambulance corps and of course MOYski..'been hangin' out with my sis alot and of course old friends I missed for a year. (fya and mascians)...
OH yeah I'm sooo obsessed with friendster... so many old friends I finally reunited with... another blessing in disguise... God was like> ""hey come on now, those kids from highview and stony shouldn't put you dwn cuz u've got many other sisters and friends to rely on"" I never forgot but I felt forgotten>> but I was wrong.
""Bad Things happen to good ppl>>> but God blesses those who are humble, merciful, persecuted and insulted""<<< 
SHOUT outs to Nea's > got hooked up on GJ but I do wanna keep in touch with u guys too miss u and don't change
acheboo>mishooo musta na buhay? ok na phone ko ulit just this week kip in touch din
BJ> putsa anong naririnig ko uwi ka >... same thing that u & nea told me nung aalis ako...""paano na siya?"" but for reals man u'll always be here in our minds naks CHACHING!
sa inyong tatlo> kahit na minsan lang tayo kita kits< iba ako mamili ng kaibigan and u guys are worth keeping (wala naman akong makitang masama sa inyo) so always keep in mind that kahit na invisible si ako> caring and never 2 4get u guys too>>>and soooo it has been narrowed down to three.

Anyways>>> I'm still learning this thing so hopefully it works aight hehe! love u moy ! ISANG TAON NA KAMI yeahhhhh.

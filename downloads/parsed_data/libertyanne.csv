"event","Men are afraid of women.&nbsp; In Ancient Greece virgin women were considered wild and were only tamed through marriage.&nbsp; This is also reflected in the Greek goddesses, particularly Artemis and Athena.&nbsp; Both are virgin goddess, immune to the persuasion of Aphrodite and rather masculine in their pursuits.&nbsp; Artemis the protector of young animals, yet the patron of hunters and the protector of wild spaces, usually wooded areas.&nbsp; Athena, the patron of her Polis, patron of young heroes and often dressed with helmet, shield, and spear.&nbsp; The Greeks needed these goddesses to remain virgins so that they could remain ""wild"".&nbsp; 
In the Amazon basin tribes practiced a feast celebration that centered around clitordectomy of marriageable girls.&nbsp; This surgery was based upon their religious belief that women once had penises and ruled the world and were wild.&nbsp; Men, with their culture and domesticity and agriculture now rule and the clitoris was viewed as a vestigial penis.&nbsp; These people also believed that women, with their vestigial penises and their ability to give birth made them ""over-sexed"" and so, in order to tame the young brides-to-be the clitoris had to be removed.&nbsp; Here again is this sense that women are ""wild"" and must be tamed, cultured by men.&nbsp; 
In many other societies women are viewed as evil or driving men to evil.&nbsp; Christianity is a great example.&nbsp; Eve convinces Adam to eat the forbidden fruit and brings about the fall of the first man and all humans.&nbsp; Since then it is women who are controlled sexually and must be obedient and kept, and when they go against this it is they that are accused of driving men to lust as if the man were bewitched.&nbsp; This idea that women must be kept ""pure"" and that they simultaneously contain magic powers of seduction over men is found in many societies ranging from ancient to modern and usually the society tries to invoke restrictions using religion.&nbsp; A more modern example or at least extreme example would be Islamic or Christian militants who impose strict dress codes for women and strict separation of men and women's roles.&nbsp; 

Fear of women seems very old and is often used to repress them.&nbsp; The sad part is, many women also buy into it.&nbsp;"

Little Rock, AR.&nbsp; Helped load up a 24' Uhaul and then we hopped into a vehicle (Nicholas and Matt drove the trucks -Penske and Uhaul-Debbie the van and I got the Mini).&nbsp; Due to a late start and an unfortunate mechanical problem with the Uhaul (gas ran out but gas gauge is messed up and the dash lights don't work) we spent the night in Memphis, TN.&nbsp; Then we got to park on I-40 for a while outside of Nashville.&nbsp; We spent the next night in Sevierville outside of Gatlinburg.&nbsp; Then we drove down really steep, twisting mountainsides that, yes, did scare me despite my ultimate driving machine.&nbsp; Finally, we reached Frederick Maryland and their rental house for a year.&nbsp; There three brothers joined us and helped us unload one and half of the trucks.&nbsp; The rest was unloaded the next morning.&nbsp; Once the move from hell ended, we were able to enjoy pleasures of the area such as the many winneries and other agritourist attractions.&nbsp;

&nbsp; Sunday afternoon we went to the grove to read and took the dog with us.&nbsp; We tied him up to the picnic table with the 20ft leash.&nbsp; Two squirrels played in the tree, chasing one another.&nbsp; However, upon their boisterous return from another tree, one squirrel didn't grasp the end of the branch well enough and fell about 30ft.&nbsp; Chorni took off after it.&nbsp; His leash ran out and he was snapped backwards in an amazing up and over&nbsp; back flip.&nbsp; Poor thing.&nbsp; It only added injury to insult of&nbsp; no squirrel.&nbsp; 

I am now a research assistant for Dr. Wicker.&nbsp; I search for reviews of her work, bring her books, and help her with a data base on bracteate.&nbsp; The biggest perk so far has been the ibook I got&nbsp; to check out.&nbsp; Yes....I lustily rubbed it.&nbsp; Did I mention she is TINY?&nbsp; But I think most of you know this.&nbsp; 

The Horse Saga Continues....
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've found a trainer that I want to send my horse to for...a refresher course.&nbsp; Ok, yes it is re-education.&nbsp; The animal does not respect my athoritei. ..there is legitimate question regarding my athoritei.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trainer is located in Abbeville, has lost his left foot, and trains gently (less braun, more psych).&nbsp; If this works out he'll be trained and then move to his new home.&nbsp; 
If any of you want to read a really good book to understand something of the horse-owning culture , I recommend ""Horse People"" .&nbsp; Nicholas read it and would read me parts that were particularly funny (there are quite a bit!).&nbsp;"

Grad school....is tiresome.&nbsp; I've learned that my generation will be responsible for the synthesis between postmodernism/political economy&nbsp; and material culture/structural functionalism.&nbsp; I think both points are valid or can be.&nbsp; Now, we must find a way to merge them....merge!&nbsp; 
I aced my phys anth test (I'm pretty sure).&nbsp; I have to finish&nbsp; Hodder and write a summary this week.&nbsp; Next week is Peter Wells.&nbsp; BTW, I like Hodder.&nbsp; He is very interesting to read and not too dry, but very logical and not at all what I expected.&nbsp; 

I rode my horse both Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; Just arena rides and not more than 25mins long, but he did really well considering how long its been.&nbsp; I also didn't want to reinjure him so I kept the work down.&nbsp; Lots of circles.&nbsp; Circles help horses understand you are in charge.&nbsp; Circles keep horses from bucking =)&nbsp; I'm looking forward to Christmas break because I will move my horse, ride him lots, read lots for myself and start on my comps questions for Wrobel and Ethridge.&nbsp; Probably write some grant proposals and such also.&nbsp; Fun times!&nbsp; 

I lead such a boring life right now.&nbsp; I get up, go to school, read, go to class, go to work or home, eat, read/watch tv and go to bed.&nbsp; yep.&nbsp; 

le sigh...What do the people think about getting coffee/pumpkin frappes on Friday afternoon/eveningish?&nbsp;"

My guess also is that you have a smart mouth that gets you in trouble and my futher advice is to say that mind over matter only really works for Professor Xavier. </td> </tr> <tr> <td align=""center""> <img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/users/146/924/14792450058226983770/mt1153027665.jpg""> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><br><br> <table cellpadding=""20""> <tbody><tr> <td> <span id=""comparisonarea"">My test tracked 2 variables How you compared to other people <i>your age and gender</i>:<blockquote><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""4""><tbody><tr><td valign=""middle""><table bgcolor=""black"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#b2cfff"" height=""20"" width=""65""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td><td bgcolor=""white"" width=""85""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign=""middle"">You scored higher than <b>43%</b> on <b>Aggression</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=""middle""><table bgcolor=""black"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#b2cfff"" height=""20"" width=""117""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td><td bgcolor=""white"" width=""33""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign=""middle"">You scored higher than <b>78%</b> on <b>Intelligence</b></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></span> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <table cellpadding=20><tr><td>Link: <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=16900251728107159263'>The Fisticuffs Psychology Test</a> written by <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=Geiger'>Geiger</a> on <a  href='http://www.okcupid.com'>OkCupid</a>, home of the <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/oktest3'>32-Type Dating Test</a></td></tr></table>"

I went to have my finger looked at to see what's eating it and the best the guy at the health center could say was exema (sp?),&nbsp; I don't think it is so I got him to refer me to a dermatologist ( not Loria).&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; So far I know it is not fungal and does not appear to be contagious.&nbsp; In the mean time I'm slathering it in a steroid cream.&nbsp; Elizabeth, any thoughts?

The wasps have all been conquered! Snakes on a Plane is only funny if you heard the voice over story w/cartman voiced Kim ....... yeah.&nbsp; I'm tired of spending money.&nbsp; I'm tired of being sweaty.&nbsp; Those are all my random thoughts.&nbsp; 

David, good luck!&nbsp; I'm sure you'll do fine.&nbsp; Sorry your summer wasn't better.&nbsp; 

Jessica: I like Miles Davis, Sylvia Plath, Jim Corbet, Joseph Conrad, Ayn Rand,&nbsp; Oscar Wilde, tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Brecht, the impressionists especially Manet, I like the dutch painters too but they tend to be very dark.&nbsp; I don't like a lot of modern art but I have found favorites.&nbsp; I love art deco.&nbsp; I really enjoy movies.&nbsp; I love what can be done with lighting and color and when that is combined with music and good acting
  it is marvelous.&nbsp; I hope you still like me =)"

"event","The dig is going well!&nbsp; We've found about eight glass beads of various size and color.&nbsp; Most that I've seen are made by winding the glass around a central object.&nbsp; These glass beads all originate in Europe.&nbsp; Unfortuanately the native americans never grasped the idea of heating sand to form glass.&nbsp; we've found two hoes and a hollow metal pipe with one end beaten into a chisle.&nbsp; We weren't expecting that!&nbsp; We're still excavating the pit and we're also now going to start opening up units where the geophys picked up metal dipols and where the metal detector picked up a signal too (go get the measurements for the 1X1meter layout).&nbsp; This should be exciting!&nbsp; I love this job!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm nice and tan on my arms and neck and face and part of my chest.&nbsp; but...no where else.&nbsp; 

We recently learned that the developer and prospective buyer of the property we currently rent is only one pre-sell away from getting his money from the bank so we've made agreements elsewhere.&nbsp; Luckily my friend and sometimes opponent Jacob informed us that his neighbor is moving and so Nicholas and I will soon be residing at the white apartments across from the cemetery in a two bedroom for a sweet low price of 380/month!&nbsp; YES!!! Still within non-motorized commute and VERY affordable.&nbsp; THANK YOU JACOB!!!!&nbsp; OH, and Chorni is no longer a dog; he is a big kitty.&nbsp; This is ofcourse according to our dog owning apt. manager.&nbsp; YESSS!!!!&nbsp; 

I'm not quitting at the Library&nbsp; just yet because they need me and my pay is raised due to my graduate status.&nbsp; So...currently two jobs and possibly two jobs in the fall but very low key jobs.&nbsp; One in the lab (cross fingers!) and one in the library (can walk).&nbsp; 

Can't wait to see folks this fall!!!&nbsp;"

"event","Today was a great day.&nbsp; We had water delivered to our creek so we could do water screening without having to go fret with the intake every 5 minutes.&nbsp; The screen crew found glass beads (very pretty little things) and we trench diggers found pot shards (MANY incised), flakes and even an arrow head!&nbsp; But the biggest find I must brag was mine =)&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the metal object in the pit and it was a....HOE!&nbsp; However it is not a spanish hoe like the first one found in the pit.&nbsp; So it is either English or French.&nbsp; I'll be excited to find out.&nbsp; 

Today has been one of those days that makes digging square holes into the ground worthwhile.&nbsp; Though these are not the people I want to study for my masters thesis I am enjoying learning about them and their interaction at the time with European traders.&nbsp; 

Dr. Murray is trying to set up an independent study reading course for me so I can catch up on background and just possibly find a thesis topic/area.&nbsp; Yeah....sure I know what I'm doing....&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully he'll decide I need to go to Germany with him =)&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I'm debating on wheter or not to quit the library.&nbsp; I've gotten a pay raise since I'm a graduate student but I don't really want to work.&nbsp; I could just do nights and weekends but....*shrug* I don't know.&nbsp; This archaeology gig could last a while esp if I get to help with the lab work and it pays more than the library but is temporary.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; I'm not looking forward to Gabe's class but hopefully I'll have the balls to do what I need to: go ask what he specifically wants in papers.&nbsp; 

Right now we have three first year grad students working on the dig: John Cappleman, Ben ?(Hayley might know....), and me.&nbsp; It feels like arch grad orientation!&nbsp; Fun times...."

"event","So drinking coffee after work when you get off at 10PM is not wise unless you have a paper to finish.  I have no paper to finish so now I'm diligently (read: obcessively) checking LJ and gmail.  I'm also doing a face mask for the first time.  Yeah, I'm a little unfamiliar with the whole ""beauty products"" area.  Thought I'd try it since my face is being expose to large amounts of dust and sweat.  And what better else to do when a girl can't sleep?  

I know, the title hints that the post should be some sort of introspection and dealing with my putting on a ""mask"" in public to people.  However, unlike some peole I don't really have a set persona I try to convey.  So this is little more than a superficial facial mask post inspired by caffine."

"event","OK, so it's been a little stressful - at least on my personal scale - since the holidays.  Survived Christmas at Mom's, which is no small feat.  At least twice on christmas eve and two or three times on christmas day I of course could not do anything right, including being accused of smacking her bratty dog when the dog in question had knocked me off balance, and in trying not to fall over I flailed and tapped her with the leash I was holding.  Peeling potatoes wasn't going nearly fast enough since I don't do a whole lot of that, so she had to reach in and do some of it for me.  This is life with my mother, and she doesn't understand why I never want to come over just to visit.

New year's eve I chickened out, worried about more stupid drivers on ice than normal, so we stayed home.  

Meanwhile one of the <a href=http://sites.google.com/site/browningsville/>bands</a> I play in was gearing up for beginning of rehearsals on Jan. 8.  Our director of 8 years has moved out of the area, so a new director was needed.  When no-one stepped up, I said I could give it a try if no-one else came forward.  A couple others did, so ""auditions"" were held at the first two practices, with each of us leading the band for an hour or so, then elections last night. 

Yeah, it went that way.  So now I have to learn how to lead a bunch of adult-sized kids, and attempt to instill a bit of discipline without being a right b!tch about it.  This will be interesting - in the manner of that delightful Chinese curse.  On the other hand, if I survive this, I'll have one shoulder bulked up by the end of the summer.

I also have finally gotten my student loan paid off.  Interesting how on their graduated repayment plan it should have been paid off in may of 2008.  When I was gainfully employed, I would make double payments when I could, and suddenly the monthly due dropped.  After I was only semi-employed, I still made extra payments whenever I could.  Ironically, in this month they decided to increase the monthly payment to almost 150% of the old payment, which was MORE THAN WAS STILL OUTSTANDING.  When the final payment went through, not a peep, no notification that it was done, just the note about the amount increasing.  I love beaurocracy.

And of course now that I have car payments do deal with, the number of my private music students is dropping.  Some of it is the after-holiday chaos, some of it is the economy, some of it is kids with no time because of sports and other activities.  Le sigh.  Tossing around some other ideas to make a few bucks on the side, still tuning the occasional piano.

Still want to move as soon as I can get this house de-cluttered and ready to put on the market.  May need to borrow the former boss' Bobcat and let Cam clear things out that way.  Amazing how mush STUFF accumulates over the... 6? 7? years we've been in this house.

So yeah, that's been me for the past few weeks.  I know, I know, more frequent posts would keep this from being so long-winded."

I don't wanna hear it from other people, so why should anyone wanna hear it from me?  So, general observations, news, who knows.  Perhaps the occasional bit of bad fiction.

News. 

Well, I bought a car a week and a half ago.  Finally got the Prius I'd been after for, oh, a year.  Probably could have held out a bit longer, but every time I got one thing fixed on the old car something more expensive broke.  It's taking getting used to, I'm not too comfortable with the console layout yet, and pushing a button to go into park instead of moving the shift lever up is odd.  But neat.  And not having to buy gas every week is a big plus.

Bird news:  Migrants have started to arrive, both white-throated sparrows and juncos.  Still have a stubborn pair of robins.

Latest obsessions:
king.com games.  Free if you want, or optional paid membership.  Went for the paid membership, not sure if that was a wise move.  Just one more game... 

Dungeons & Dragons Online Eberron.  
Yep, I finally gave up and tried an MMORPG, something I didn't think I would ever do.  It's free, that helps.  It's an Eberron setting, which helps immensely.  My serial ranger is back in yet another incarnation.  The pluses:  It's free.  It's a neat world.  You don't have to interact with other people if you don't want to.  Quests can be selected at different levels for more or less challenge.
The minuses:  Doesn't follow any set of D&D rules I'm familiar with, all the way.  Some things are definitely from 3.5, others definitely from 4.  Others... *shrug* something else for the online version?  Perhaps."

Feeling downright nauseous about the upcoming election.  Both of the main-party candidates disgust me, and the third-party folks aren't doing much better in my eyes.

Not in any way shape or form in the mood to listen to ""I disagree so I'm right and you're wrong and how can you think that way?!!1!!"" from anyone.

Lots of laundry to do.  Should continue working on figuring out how to play the flute.  Yeah, I got a flute a while back.  Figured since I play most of the other woodwinds, I may as well add that, and there are times when it could be helpful to one of the bands I play with.  It's taking some getting used to.  Probably ought to spend some quality time with the keyboard too, I've been slacking off on the practicing there.

"event","So despite all the hubbub and stuff, the Large Hadron Collider has been fired up, albeit not yet at full power.  And amazingly, the universe hasn't imploded.  Now I freely admit that I don't remember much of Physics beyond basic high school level, so I dismissed the people who wanted it to never work as extremists. 

So yesterday's Washington Post had an article about it.  In the Style section with the fashion and performing arts and comics, which goes to show how much the Post knows about science.  According to the article, the people against it are worried about it making black holes.

Seriously?  Well, yeah, according to the article.  Which I take with many grains of salt given the Post's biases.  Same article says that the scientists on the project are not worried, as any black holes they make would be microscopic and only last a fraction of a second, like the ones that occur naturally in space caused by cosmic rays.

Now putting aside any opinions about whether it might be a good thing to open up a black hole under or near France, I have to ask if it's realistic?  Could this Big Gizmo actually cause a Rift In Time And Space!!! large enough that anyone other than the instruments watching would even notice?  I simply can't imagine it's -that- powerful, but as I said earlier, I don't remember much about Physics beyond basic global forces.

One of the young (high school graduate) teachers at the store comes up to me yesterday to ask a favor.  Seems her friend had asked her to play a little piano at her wedding.  Next weekend.  Teacher has evidently made other plans after forgetting that she agreed to do this.  Teacher has asked me if I can do it.

It's an excerpt from a piece that isn't too hard, with a little practice I should be able to do it fine, assuming I can get over the performance jitters - you know, the whole reason that my degree doesn't say Music Performance on it.  After some grilling of Teacher, it turns out that this is to be used as the processional.

Um. 

Well, at least no-one would be paying attention to me.

Now, there are a few questions I've had Teacher ask the Bride, I have not definitely agreed to this yet.  Things like where and when - how far away is it?  And whether or not I'd at least get gas money.  If I do this to help out Miss Teacher, she at least ought to compensate me a little for covering her butt.  Something else I will need to ask though - is the Bride OK with this?  It seems to me that Bride asked Teacher to do this because it would mean a lot to the Bride to have her friend playing her down the aisle, and since friend is effectively dissing her for something else... why not just have whoever is playing the rest of the music do it?  A ""professional"" pianist  - one who's doing this anyway - would find the piece quite easy.

And I'm not getting into the whole moral thing of abandoning your friend on what's supposed to be one of the biggest days of her life.  Not gettin' involved.  Just trying to decide if I -should- do this at all."

In this county, I'm sure many others as well, one needs to pass a typing test as one of the requirements for a secretarial position.  Make sense, really.  I can type pretty well as long as I can look at the keys, but my accuracy usually stinks.  So I found an online typing tutor and have been working with that.

What I have learned so far:
- I can touch-type a little, but not anywhere near fast enough for the test.  That's fine, in the test I can look at my hands.

- I stink at the top row (numbers, special characters, etc.)

- I use all the fingers except the pinky, and that only sometimes.

- I seem to be better at typing Shakespeare and Dickens than modern English, even with the non-standard punctuation they use

I will be fine for the test (scheduled Friday), but plan to continue practicing even after the test to increase speed and accuracy.  I will probably work slowly on better touch-typing, cause why not? I would think I would be able to go faster if I'm not constantly switching the eyes from the keyboard to whatever I'm reading from the to screen and such.  

As a side note, the idea of re-entering the work force is completely and utterly terrifying."

From the director of Montgomery Village Community Band, one of the groups I play in. 

""Dear Band Members:
 
On Wednesday night we are going to record ""Let's Go"" for inclusion on a nationally distributed CD.  The other bands that will be represented are Virginia Grand Military Band, Federal City Brass Band, and TUSAB , Pershing's Own.  The CD will be distributed nationally by Altissimo! and offered in the same sales venues as many of the top military bands.  It will be an honor to have MVCB on this disc, so we want to give it our very best performance.""  


I can honestly say I'd never dreamed of being on a nationally distributed CD.  Not that you'll be able to hear me specifically, but still."

"event","I'm reading a book from the library.  Sci-fi genre, not really hard science but it tries to back up its fantastic ideas with real science.  There is a character who is a genius scientist but also a real raging ... not-nice person.  He uses foul language.  He takes the lord's name in vain.  This doesn't really bother me.  It takes a lot to offend me generally, and if it does I simply stop reading it.  If someone asks my opinion I will give it, but I'm not going to go around telling everyone I see not to read this OMGWTFBBQ!!!!1!!11

But someone else who had the book at some point has crossed out every time any character uses the f-bomb, or any other ""bad word.""  Often writing in PC alternatives.  At least in pencil, so the printed words are still quite legible.  Once she (it's feminine handwriting) felt compelled to write (Why does an intelligent author use such an unintelligent word?""  If a character says ""goddamn"" or ""Jesus Christ"" she has to alter that to, including writing ""blasphemy!""

Now here's my issue.  OK, several issues. 

1 - If this book offends you so badly... who is forcing you to read it?  Just put it down and return it to the library.  The world will not come to an end.  There is no commandment that says Thou Must Finish Every Book Thou Pickest Up, No Matter How Offensive.  Are you that worried that someone will use this book to teach your children these horrible words OH NOES!!!11!!1  Funny, the book was not in any of the children's sections.

2 - IT'S NOT YOUR BOOK!  You didn't pay for it, the County did.  This is no different from spray painting crap on walls.  It's vandalism, plain and simple.  I'm pretty sure there's stuff in the Bible somewhere about respecting the property of others, I could be wrong.  All you are accomplishing is fueling your own indignant rage as someone is forcing you to read this book (see No. 1 above) and irritating the other people trying to read the book.

3 - Someone else felt the need to write in an answer, further defacing the book.  Never mind that the answer was entertaining.  Crazy gal had crossed out ""jesus christ"" and replaced it with ""Good grief.""  Answer was ""Only Charlie Brown uses that, you religious prick.""  It's somewhat reminiscent of written conversations on bathroom walls, and just about as juvenile.

4 - Pointless?  The authoress is never going to see this particular copy of her book, even if she does live in this county.  If you feel this is such a problem, perhaps a rational letter to her publisher?  Oh wait, you don't do rational do you, god hasn't told you that part.

OK, I think I'm done ranting.  For a moment at least.  The question out there is do I:  (A) Take an eraser to it and do my best to restore the poor book; (B) Tell the library staff about it when I finish and return it; or (C) sigh about human morons  and do nothing?

Side note - I do quite like the book, and the series so far, when I finish this one I'll do a little mini-review."

<b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Good GnomeRanger (4th Level)
<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>12<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>12<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>12<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>13<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>12<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>11
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them. Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order. However, neutral good can be a dangerous alignment because because it advances mediocrity by limiting the actions of the truly capable.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Gnomes</b> are in wide demand as alchemists, inventors, and technicians, though most prefer to remain among their own kind in simple comfort. Gnomes adore animals, gems, and jokes, especially pranks. They love to learn by personal experience, and are always trying new ways to build things. Gnomes stand 3 to 3.5 feet tall and live about 350 to 500 years.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are skilled stalkers and hunters who make their home in the woods. Their martial skill is nearly the equal of the fighter, but they lack the latter's dedication to the craft of fighting. Instead, the ranger focuses his skills and training on a specific enemy a type of creature he bears a vengeful grudge against and hunts above all others. Rangers often accept the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. His skills allow him to move quietly and stick to the shadows, especially in natural settings, and he also has special knowledge of certain types of creatures. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw on natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does, and like a druid he is often accompanied by animal companions. A ranger's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that he can cast.

Finally flip it over and see ""Watt Watchers, Allegheny Power.""  The hell?  Whay is the power company sending me packages?  So I open it.  It's these new compact flourescent bulbs that evidently the power companies are pushing now.  Propaganda letter about how they last so much longer, which I believe, and supposedly draw less power, which I don't, if every home in America switched out just one bulb there would be enough saved electricity to power umpteen tens of thousands of homes.  Uh-huh.  Then on the back it says how they're trying to reduce the draw on power plants since coal-fired plants release so much mercury into the air.  And most of the page is about the safety stuff you have to do if you break one, such as clearing out the room for 15 minutes with an open window.  Why?  Because the bulb has some allegedly minute amount of.... Mercury!  So we're going to save teh erth and think of ten children by reducing coal-fired mercury emissions but make efficient bulbs with mercury in them.  That if it breaks in a home is more hazardous to teh children then a power plant.

Now I haven't done all my research on these bulbs, so I welcome scientific opinions.  It seems to me that if they want more energy efficient and longer lasting bulbs, there's these things called LEDs, been around for decades.  I know they make light bulbs with them."

Admittedly I am keeping at 2 on the day I do bookkeeping for Owner Q so that I have a chance in hell of actually making it on time.  Brought my laptop in Friday, since I was expecting about an hour of actual work and three of nap.

I didn't sit down for three and a half hours, and that was only to wolf lunch.  2 guitars in 2 hours, and various other schtuff.  Yeah, I know the Big Stores probably sell ten an hour, but for a little shop that's pretty damn good. 

Then went to rehearsal for the holiday show next weekend.  Wasn't quite on my game, but OK.  Proceeded to not sleep well that night.  

Because of course, I was coming down with a cold.  Taught two of my four lessons saturday - the two adults didn't make it - then went home and proceeded to be a bum and bore Cam to death.  This morning not much better.  Random violent sneezes and come-and-go nausea.  Yay!  

And this week promises to be interesting.  10 hour work day monday, interspersed with racing home on breaks to feed and walk the doggie since Cam is away, then race to rehearsal to 10 or so.  Repeat tuesday with an hour less at work.  Quite possibly repeat wednesday, although Cam should be home to take care of the dog by late morning. 

Then the holiday show thursday, friday, and saturday, and a different show for one of the community bands on sunday.  

Then I think the music stuff is done until january, other than at most two rehearsals for band.  

And no, I haven't even started on the gift shopping yet.  Planning on doing some online shopping today while I'm being a bum and trying to keep food in my stomach."

"event","On Gypsy:  Last weekend was OK.  Opening night the audience was about the same size as the cast.  Saturday was better, good responsive audience.  Sunday I wasn't there, but I'm told the audience was NOT responsive.  So we go to this weekend - last night.  First act went well, we thought.  They were filming for the $35 show DVD (too stiff for me!).  Intermission goes on.  And on.  We start getting restless.  Then Director sneaks out and talks to Conductor.  Director then goes up on stage and gets the audience's attention.  Two of the actors, including one of the female leads (Mama Rose) are ""violently ill"" and cannot continue.  We give them one of the fun stripper numbers from Act 2 and send them home, Director says if they bring their ticket stubs back tonight or sunday they can get in with it.   Here's hoping that all is well tonight.

Yesterday afternoon I went over to a friend/coworkers house to take apart his piano.  Need to get hands-on experience as I'm learning how to tune the darn things.  It's different.  His piano's in pretty sad shape, but I fiddled about.  Nice feeling to go from twangy out of tune western-movie sound on two unison strings to suddenly sounding like it's supposed to.  Discovered that while y ear is pretty good, it will take a lot more practice to be able to do proper temperment by ear.  But that's why I spent $700 on a strobe tuner.  I need to get a lot more time in with my hands in a piano, but with the help of the strobe tuner I think I can do this."

"event","So the delightful owners of my store have been crunching numbers for a while since the store isn't making them thousands of dollars a month.  They have decided that the numbers are now showing that we pay the teachers for an average of 50 lessons per month that we don't take in money for.

I'm calling bullshit.  I watch the lesson counts and money very closely, and there are no more than 5 per month.  Something is wrong with the way the numbers are being crunched, but since I'm not privy to their magical formulas I don't know where the problem is. 

Their idea to solve it?  Charge the students per month as we do, but do not offer credits and such for re-schedules or vacations.  If a student misses a lesson, it's up to them and the teacher to find a make-up day.   Which all the other stores in the area do. 

Fine.  What the f ever.  So we'll lose a few students, and even though everyone else does it, if they storm off to go somewhere else, they WON'T COME BACK because they're pissed.

Next, they want to pay the teachers monthly instead of weekly.  I think they want to do a flat monthly rate, which makes no sense whatsoever as the student count changes week to week.  So if a teacher books 10 new students in the course of a month, they won't see the money for 3-7 weeks?  Like hell.  How are you going to run a school with no teachers?  There are several teachers who rely on the weekly income to get them through each week, and who cannot budget out a month.  So they'll save all this money... and promptly lose half the students when several major teachers leave.  Myself and another teacher have fully half the current students.

So I won't be sleeping tonight, that's for sure."

The director of the Montgomery Village band that I play oboe in has resources and connections and needed players for the gig.

The gig, in general was fun.  More importantly, it was PAID!  (Which is why I was willing to go 2 hours each way to get there.)  I though the town Oktoberfest was going to be a huge deal, and it wasn't.  Dragged Cam along and he was bored stiff within five minutes.  My playing was pretty much abysmal.  Oh, I could scare up all sorts of excuses from extreme heat (it -was- bloody hot) to low blood sugar to a bad case of the jitters, but it boils down to what I really knew all along.  I'm just not good enough on clarinet.  I guess I needed this to take my poor timid ego down a notch.

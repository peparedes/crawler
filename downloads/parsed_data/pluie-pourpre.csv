cant cant wait to go on a holiday. been bored and stuck in a rut for weeks. time for winter clothing shopping.

i seriously feel like a spendthrift. eat too much, play too much, watch too much, wear too much. my current WISHES are to buy a lovely coat for overseas trip, timberland boots if possible, turtlenecks, scarf with a sweet colour, cool sweaters... i think that's about it. and these already cost a bomb.

not to mention the indulgence i've been allowing myself to have over food. sweet but painful.

okay plans for holidays? none. besides the overseas trip and short stop at hometwn there's nothing much to look forward to. i bet i'll be celebrating my birthday eating stuff that i dont like, considering the location i'll be at that pt in time.

i dont even really count this as a holiday. tutorials to be done, tests to study for. life.

i just wish i had the finances, mood (didnt know you have to have the appropriate mood to have a holiday), time, energy, friends to travel. like really travel. not just a pit stop. but oh well. reality sets in pretty fast when you day-dream. especially when you happen to glance at the bookcase i have at home.

this sounds eerie but it's almost like the books are calling you to read them."

all the ladies lookin' good eh?

maybe time travelling isn't that bad. u get to revisit moments that u never treasured when they were the present. maybe i always thought that the present will always remain, be happy and cheerful. well i was wrong.

haha i don't ever think i can learn my lesson but at least i know there are people who can stop me from burrowing myself in the depths of the earth and just crawl my way through life. ugh, i hate myself sometimes."

"event","post promos euphoria is totally absent. somehow, ongoing exams make me yearn for the day of liberation. but when it finally arrives, i realized that maybe i prefer being enslaved. or perhaps i've been enslaved for so long that i don't even know what it means to be free. freedom is like an illusion."

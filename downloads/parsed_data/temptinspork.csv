<P><EM>Monday</EM>: <U>Busn115</U>~8-10; <U>Socs185</U>~10-11; <U>Psych110</U>~1-2</P>
<P><EM>Tuesday</EM>: <U>Coll148</U>~8-10</P>

<P><EM>Thursday</EM>: Nothing</P>
<P><EM>Friday</EM>: <U>Coll148</U>~10-11; <U>Comp100</U>~11-12; <U>Busn115</U>~12-1; <U>Socs185</U>~1-2</P>
<P>So there ya go. My lovely schedule. I still need to add maybe another english or math class, but im not sure yet.&nbsp;I have to go find out after i write this entry. the only thing that really stinks is <EM>Wednesday</EM>. Right now im waiting for my class at 2. I have four hours to do nothing. And on <EM>Friday</EM>, i dont even get a lunch break. Ill need to bring in snacks. We get breaks half way through so its not too bad. I have 2 classes with my sister. I was told since were in different majors, that i get to graduate earlier than her, but i can still wait to walk with her. All my friends better be at my graduation in 3 and a half years. Youll be on my <STRONG><EM><U>A</U></EM></STRONG>-list if youre not. And if you havent figured that out....thats not good. Haha.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>North Carolina</EM></STRONG> was fun. We went swimming, Mini-golfing, shopping, and the like. My lil sis and <STRONG>Crystal</STRONG>'s lil bro got annoying a lot but hey they are kids, right? I felt real bad cuz when i talked to my mom she had to go over to <STRONG>Renee</STRONG>'s house for food. <STRONG>Krystal</STRONG> was never home and therefore my mom didnt have any money to get food or anything. That made me wish i stayed home. I talked to <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> on the way up there and while i was there. He invited me to hang out with his friends when i got home. But instead, since i didnt hear from him, when i got home <EM>Friday</EM> night, i went to hang out with <STRONG>John</STRONG>. </P>
<P><EM>Saturday</EM>, <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> called and asked if i wanted to go to <STRONG><EM>Land</EM></STRONG> <STRONG><EM>O'Lakes</EM></STRONG> with him to get his wallet out of his work truck. I went and when we got back we went over <STRONG>Buddy</STRONG>'s house and just hung out. After <STRONG>Buddy</STRONG>'s house, <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> came back to my house. We watched <U><EM>Hitch</EM></U>, and talked about some stuff. I dont know what to about him. I thought i was over him but i guessed wrong. I know how you feel <STRONG>Doug</STRONG>. I can say i was almost completely over him until <STRONG>Doug</STRONG> broke up with me and then i saw him again. So....I dont know. </P>
<P>Last night, i hung out with John again. We watched <EM><U>The Punisher</U></EM>. I love that movie. Tonight, i might hang out with Doug. It depends on if he gets a hold of me later. We have two matches. A basketball match and a mini-golfing match. And maybe even a bowling match. We havent done anything yet. When we do, ill keep you posted on who wins what. I talked to <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> this morning when i got to school and he said hell call me when he can. I wont expect anything. I have a question to ask him, but it can wait til i see him again. And only the Lord knows when that is. I sure dont.</P>
<P>I should go. Ill try to update more since i have time in school now. If anyone wants to hang out let me know. </P>"

"event","Wow. A lot has happened since i last updated a month ago.&nbsp; I already talked about my gay-ass party. lol. I left to go to North Carolina from June 10th to June 13th. My brother was getting deployed so we went to say goodbye. On June 15th Doug finally asked me out. Of course i said yes. But then we both had to leave. He went to Arkansas for soccer nationals which they placed 3rd in the nation. I went to the Bahamas!! If you want to know how that went....read Kyler's LJ (kkthemp). I got back the 19th while Doug got back the 20th. It killed us both not to be able to talk to each other for 3 days. Haha. Well then we spent almost everyday together until he went to St. Augustine with Kevin. He even came to Orlando with me, my mom, and my sister. We went to my college and then drove around a little. He left on the 27th and got back the 29th. I got my permit on the 29th. Finally!! I failed by one the first time i took the test. lol. Well June 30th i spent with Doug for like 5 hours. Friday, July 1st,&nbsp;after driving around Ocala for nothing, Doug called me and said that he had a lot of things on his mind. He said he didnt want me to drive all the way over to Inverness or him have to drive to Lake Pan to talk about it. He broke up with me for reasons i dont want everyone to know. If you absolutely need to know, ask him yourself. Well that kinda ruined my day. Doug was the first guy i actually really liked since Bryon. Then my sis-in-law showed up from NC to pick up her lil bro and my lil sis. She asked if i wanted to go. I figured i had no reason to stay so i said sure. we left on the second. I also ended up going over Bryons house the night Doug broke up with me. I had had a real bad day and needed someone to talk to so i chose him. I hadnt seen him for a while either. We got to his house and i told him everything. Well almost everything. He was actually sympathetic and gave me money to go away and everything. He drove to my sis-in-laws friends house the next morning so i could leave, too. Ill be home from NC this Friday. I have orientation on Saturday and&nbsp; i start school on Monday. Its coming fast. Wish me luck!!!<!-- ZoneLabs Popup Blocking Insertion -->

"event","<P>Well, my party was <EM>Saturday</EM>, last night. It kinda sucked at first cuz there was nothing to do. I think it just started a little too early. Let me see if I can name everyone that showed up. Here goes: <STRONG>Gary</STRONG>, <STRONG>Nate</STRONG>, <STRONG>Justin</STRONG>, <STRONG>Freddie</STRONG>, <STRONG>Thi</STRONG>, <STRONG>Brian</STRONG>, <STRONG>Dustin</STRONG>, <STRONG>Doug</STRONG>, <STRONG>Danny</STRONG>, <STRONG>Boogie</STRONG>, <STRONG>Daniel</STRONG>, and his friend. Yeah...if you didnt notice, theyre all guys. <STRONG>Cristina</STRONG> told me that she was definitely coming, but then she never showed up. <STRONG>Kyler</STRONG> said she was going to call after she got out of work, but she never did. <STRONG>Shana</STRONG> couldnt come cuz it was her moms bday. <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> told me he was going to come with <STRONG>Buddy</STRONG>, but, of course, like always, he never showed up. </P>
<P>Come to find out...<STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> forgot about my graduation. He came over Friday night and said...again...that he doesnt know how to but he wants to break up with his girlfriend and he misses me. He said something about moving to <EM><U>Indiana</U></EM> with his work. I told him if he did that, then never expect anything at all from me. Id definitely be through with him. Im trying to be now, but its not working very well.</P>
<P>Anyways, back to my party. Everybody but <STRONG>Doug</STRONG>, <STRONG>Gary</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Nate</STRONG> left. When it got dark, <STRONG>Gary</STRONG> brought out the <EM><U>Southern Comfort</U></EM> for himself. I asked my mom to get some <EM><U>Green Apple Smirnoff</U></EM>, and she did. <STRONG>Gary</STRONG> was wasted. <STRONG>Nate</STRONG> was pretty bad. I had a huge buzz from drinking 4 <EM><U>Smirnoffs</U></EM>, but I dont think I was drunk. <STRONG>Nate</STRONG> slept in my bed and <STRONG>Gary</STRONG> slept on the floor. <STRONG>Me</STRONG> and Doug didnt go to sleep. We stayed up all night...talking on the couch. :) Ive only had about 2 hrs of sleep today. And Im not that tired. Oh well...all the people that left missed out cuz it was a blast when everyone started drinking. <STRONG>Doug</STRONG> was the only sober one at my house. Thats great though. Hes a good guy. <STRONG>Gary</STRONG> left like a ten minute&nbsp;message on <STRONG>Bryons</STRONG> phone. It was hilarious. I wonder what <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> will do.</P>
<P>But anyway, I guess thats enough for now. I dont really know what else to say except thanx to all the people that showed up to my house.</P>"

Saturday, i watched movies until <STRONG>Krystal</STRONG> and <STRONG>Bryan</STRONG> showed up, then <STRONG>Tim</STRONG> and <STRONG>JD</STRONG> came over for a bit. We went outside and shot some hoops until it started sprinkling and we had to go inside. I kicked both <STRONG>JD</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tim</STRONG>'s butts in bball. Haha. </P>
<P><EM>Sunday</EM>, i went to baccaloreate (i really dont know how to spell that). i was invited to do everything all at once. <STRONG>Cori</STRONG> and <STRONG>Kyler</STRONG> invited me to go karaoking. I was invited to hang out with <STRONG>Dustin</STRONG>. And i was invited to go to Ybor. Wondering how i made my decision? I had already told <STRONG>Brian</STRONG> that i wanted to go to Ybor with him so i did that. We went to Tatto Underground. <STRONG>Brian</STRONG> wanted to get his tongue pierced. We went to Chilis first so he could have his last good meal for about 2 or 3 weeks. While waiting for <STRONG>Brian</STRONG> to come out of the room, i was talking to the tatto artist there named <STRONG>Jevon</STRONG>. Hes actually from Sumter County, too. I thought that was awesome. <STRONG>Brian</STRONG> was hurtin afterwards. He didnt talk forever and when he did, it was hilarious. He couldnt say ""Dumbass."" lol. Good Times.</P>
<P><EM>Monday</EM>, i babysat for <STRONG>Mrs</STRONG>. <STRONG>Tyler</STRONG> from IPS. Her kids are&nbsp;adorable. Then i went to Lessburg to play pool with <STRONG>Brian</STRONG>, <STRONG>Stephen</STRONG>, and Stephen's girlfriend <STRONG>Ashley</STRONG>. I had fun even though i cant play pool even if my life depended on it. lol.</P>
<P><EM>Tuesday</EM>, i went with my mom to get our trailor from Scooter Haven. That took forever and i was tired. It was also really hot. Then when i got home i talked to <STRONG>Kyler</STRONG> and met up with her and <STRONG>D to the OUG</STRONG> to have a movie night. We played XBOX til <STRONG>Brad</STRONG> and <STRONG>Joe</STRONG> showed up. Then we ate and watched Anchorman. Brownies were awesome! SHIBBY! *I love Scotch...Scotch, Scotch, Scotch.* =) Then when i got home, <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> came over and said the same exact thing he said a month ago. He said he would try and come to my graduation. We'll see.</P>
<P><EM>Wednesday</EM>, i went to the Senior Breakfast. After, i didnt get my diploma cuz i had to pay for a stupid book. I went and paid for it. Then i went to <STRONG>Edel</STRONG>'s room to get my awards for the banquet that i didnt get a chance to go to. Then, i went over to IPS to say hi to my classes and the guidance ladies. Such nice people.</P>
<P><EM>Thursday</EM>, i had to babysit til 4. My <STRONG>mom</STRONG> and <STRONG>Rhonda</STRONG> came and picked me up. Everyone was running around the house trying to get ready for graduation.&nbsp;I had&nbsp;5 people&nbsp;go for just me. But there was more going for both me and my sister. After graduation, i say goodbye to all my friends. *tear* <STRONG>Bryon</STRONG> never showed up. I knew he wasnt going to, but i was hoping&nbsp;he wouldve. <STRONG>Kathi</STRONG> or her parents didnt come either. Their <STRONG>grandparents</STRONG> came though. Theyre great. Then i rode the bus with <STRONG>Doug</STRONG> and <STRONG>Pat</STRONG>&nbsp;to project graduation. We had a blast when we met up with <STRONG>Kyler</STRONG> there. We mostly played Volleyball the whole time. <STRONG>Me</STRONG> and <STRONG>Doug</STRONG> went swimming once&nbsp;and then i started playing volleyball again.&nbsp;I won a $30 gift certificate to Bath and Body Works. <STRONG>Kyler</STRONG> got one for some other place.&nbsp;I forgot, but she also got a phone. Im giving her my certificate. <STRONG>Doug</STRONG> got hubcaps for his invisible car. <STRONG>Pat</STRONG> won the TV. </P>
<P><EM>Friday</EM>, on the way back to the school at like 5:30 in the morning, i fell asleep on <STRONG>Doug</STRONG>'s shoulder. You make a nice pillow. lol. Then i had to wait forever for my mom to get to the school like always.&nbsp;I slept a little and then woke up to nobody but <STRONG>Krystal</STRONG> in the house. <STRONG>Kylers</STRONG> party is tonight and im gonna be a little late. <STRONG>Bryan</STRONG> (<STRONG>Krystal</STRONG>'s boyfriend), said hes not driving either of us in the truck to go to her party. <STRONG>James</STRONG> isnt home so i have to wait til <STRONG>Renee</STRONG> wakes up and comes over to bring me. Hes such a dick. Whatever. I talked to <STRONG>Jevon</STRONG> today. Hes supposed to be calling me back or ill call him later. I was also invited to go to a party at <STRONG>Danny</STRONG>'s house tonight and tomorrow night. I might to a theme park tomorrow with my family, so i dont know if ill go at all. But i guess thats it for now. This is a really long lj. Woops. Oh well. lol. Later.</P>

Im not bragging or anything, but it was great. It started out with <STRONG>Dustin</STRONG>, then when i went to the graduation, i gave it to <STRONG>Brandon</STRONG>, <STRONG>Danny</STRONG>, <STRONG>Craig</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Freddie</STRONG>. I saw a whole bunch of people, like <STRONG>Darrel</STRONG>, the <STRONG>Harrison</STRONG> <STRONG>Twins</STRONG>, <STRONG>Domino</STRONG>, <STRONG>Houston</STRONG>, <STRONG>Jade</STRONG>, <STRONG>Mary</STRONG>, <STRONG>Rainer</STRONG>, <STRONG>Lindsay</STRONG>, <STRONG>Jacque</STRONG>, <STRONG>Marissa</STRONG>, <STRONG>Jessica</STRONG>, <STRONG>Jessica</STRONG>, <STRONG>Fabian</STRONG>, <STRONG>Lauren</STRONG>, <STRONG>Sylvanus</STRONG>, <STRONG>DJ</STRONG>, <STRONG>Lonzo</STRONG>, <STRONG>Brian</STRONG>, <STRONG>Justin</STRONG>, <STRONG>Bubba</STRONG>, <STRONG>Josh</STRONG>, and some more, but i cant think of anymore names. We were the last people to leave the graduation and while walking to the car <STRONG>Freddie</STRONG> took my cell phone and him and <STRONG>Josh</STRONG> were playing monkey in the middle with me. It was bad cuz they both are tall and im really short. lol. <FONT size=4>Good Times!</FONT></P>
<P>Im supposed to go to my banquet today, but i dont have a ride....<FONT size=4>=(</FONT><FONT size=3>. My mom decided to leave me with no number at all and no way to get a hold of her. I spent all last night by myself. <STRONG>Krystal</STRONG> left the graduation before i did with her boyfriend. They were going out to eat. She called my cell when i got home and said that she got lost and they were renting a hotel room. So i dont know where they are. I was sooo bored last night and i am again now.&nbsp;I watched Van Wilder then Finding Nemo. Good Movies!</FONT></P>
<P>*I shall call him squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my squishy. Come here squishy...* lol.</P>
<P>I was trying to put pictures on my lj but i dont know how....If anyone knows how, can you give me some pointers? Please. I might update later if im still bored......</P>"

<P>Last day of school and it was awesome. the best type of day ive had for a while. krystal went and seen what everybody had in economics after the english exam. i had a B before the exam, B on the exam, and a B as a final grade in the class. i was soooo happy! i forgot to bring in a book i borrowed from a teacher for my research paper. i have to bring it in before i graduate. i had to say goodbye to my kindergarteners and my first graders...=(. im gonna miss the little kids. the ladys in guidance asked me to come back for lunch. me and krystal went back over after we stopped at the band room and said bye and had everyone sign my yearbook. one of the ladys has been wanting me to meet her son. hes 19 and his name is Dustin. hes really shy, but its kinda cute.&nbsp;he seems like a really nice guy. his mom gave me their number and asked if i wanted to see Star Wars. i gave him my number too so if i can ill go to a movie with them.</P>
<P>Good Luck on your exam Kyler! i hope you did good on the economics exam, too. Jamie-Lee graduated from her 5th grade class at 1 today. and im about to leave to go to South Sumter's graduation. i need to find a ride to my moms event tonight and a ride back and forth from my moms event to the chorus banquet and then to bacchloreate (however you spell it).</P>

"event","<P>Well im kinda tired. NO, im really tired. i thought i might have gotten enough sleep, but i guess not. thursday, i stayed on the phone with a guy named <STRONG>Michael</STRONG> from Illinois. i met him online. actually i met his twin online and <STRONG>Michael</STRONG> started talking to me on his brothers name. its cool though. hes such a sweetheart. we talked from 10:30 to 2:30. i had just gotten home from Hooters cuz it was <STRONG>Kris</STRONG>'s birthday. hes a friend of the family. but yeah so i was tired on friday.</P>
<P>I also didnt have anybody to walk to classes with cuz everyday that i walk with went to the band retreat. i wish i couldve gone. but i couldnt cuz i had orientation saturday. anyways i got home aroudn 4ish on friday and i was talking to <STRONG>Michael</STRONG> on the phone til <STRONG>Thi</STRONG> called and asked if i wanted to go to the movies at pretty much the same time<STRONG> JD</STRONG> asked if i wanted to hang out later that night. <STRONG>JD</STRONG> told me to go to the movie first cuz he was going to the baseball game in tampa. we were gonna hang out around 1 or 2 depending when he got back. so i went to the movie with <STRONG>Thi</STRONG>. we saw <STRONG>Darrel Cheney</STRONG>, <STRONG>Jonathan Huggins</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Katherine Moore</STRONG> there. it was cool to see them. its been a while. we went to see Kicking and Screaming. even though i was dead tired and didnt laugh much, i thought it was hilarious.</P>
<P>Well saturday i woke up around 6:30 and got ready to go to orlando for orientation at DeVry. it was really cool how everything there was explained. im going to get a bachelors in business. my creditation is going to be accounting. then i might still go into teaching if i dont like it or just as something i love to do. ill be able to make more as a teacher if i do accounting, too. so i guess thats a plus. </P>
<P>Then i went to the band retreat. i had fun. i didnt have to do anything. i helped <STRONG>Jen</STRONG> out with her conducting. shell do great next year. i wish i could be like a clinician, but i dont think ill have time since i start at DeVry July 11. i talked to <STRONG>Dil </STRONG>and <STRONG>Leo</STRONG> a lot. <STRONG>Dil </STRONG>said ill have to look him up in orlando and when i graduate, i might be able to work for him. lol. ok...well just see how that goes.</P>
<P>I have <STRONG>Ashley</STRONG>'s (<STRONG>Bryon</STRONG>'s girlfriend) number. i really want to call her and tell her what a lying bastard her boyfriend is.&nbsp;but i need help. i dont know if i should or not. she has the right to know, right? give me some input on what you think. please. i could really use it.</P>

<P>Well all in all, my day.....sucked! today we had an aim thing outside and it was really boring. Me and Cori went back to the chorus room to hang out with Kyler. i stayed up late last night doing our stupid economics powerpoint for our presentation today. Kyler did the video and Courtney did another powerpoint. Kyler figured everything out. i guess thats why shes got a better grade than me.&nbsp;<FONT size=5>Youre the BEST Kyler!</FONT><FONT size=4> </FONT><FONT size=3>Then Mr Nelson had to go and say if we brought in food wed get an A+. screw that. </FONT></P>
<P>Right before that block i had calculus and was called up to the office. i was told i had to file an appeal for 4th block. Nelson only has me down for 4 absences when the office has me down for 5. they said if youre not there for half the period than its an absence. i left 5 minutes before the halfway period the first day back this nine weeks and they counted it as an absence. stupid office people. i hope i pass all my exams and am able to walk on graduation. if i dont, i will be truly pissed.</P>
<P>Neways. i have to go out to hooters for a family friends bday. then i have to come home and finish my homework. il ttyl.</P>

"event","Hola Wildilocks fans and friends! Been a little while since our last update and we've had a hectic summer season in Melbourne - since the move across from the CBD to North Melbourne we've settled in very well over our first couple of years and things have been cosy and continued to grow in a stable and healthy way. We have had so many clients continue with us despite the location change, a host of new faces too, but also seen some folks return who we haven't seen since long before the move, or who like us came from Perth and knew us from our older presence there. It's been great fun and we are constantly amazed and humbled by the wonderful variety and creativity we are privileged to be able to make reality thanks to your choices and requests - we really do have the best job ever and it wouldn't be possible without you! So - thankyou so much for sharing your evolving hair journeys with us, we really love doing what we do.
Now having had two lovely years in North Melbourne under our belts, we have looked closer at our trading history since the move, and have discovered some differences between here and our former CBD location. It seems that around the time daylight savings ends, there is reduced demand at the beginning of the week and earlier in the morning, but increased demand on Saturdays and evenings, - kinda makes sense because of the change in sunlight times and as weather gets colder in generally. So in response, this year we are making a trial change to our opening hours to better serve our clients and deliver services when they are most needed!

The new Winter Hours will take effect from Sunday 5th April 2015, in line with daylight savings, and will return to Summer Hours on Sunday 4th October 2015. We'll see how this first experimental change goes and if it's successful we will continue in upcoming years, also in line with Daylight Savings.
Winter Hours to be in effect from Sunday 5th April:

Monday - by appointment only
Tuesday - by appointment only
Wednesday - 11am - 5pm
Thursday - 11am - 7pm (til 9pm by appointment)
Friday - 11am - 7pm (til 9pm by appointment)
Saturday - 10am - 5pm (til 6pm by appointment)
Sunday - by appointment only

So there you go - the main change is that we will be closed now on Tuesdays except by appointment, and we will book appointments up til 9pm regularly on Thursday and Friday (previously 8pm) and Saturday til 6pm (formerly 5pm). We hope these changes work well for everyone!

In other news, we are continuing to add new stock to the webstore and we have had some lovely new additions on the shelves over the last few months, and more coming in a few weeks! Our favourites have been the new ranges from Liquor Brand (coming soon to the webstore) and more vintage swimwear from T-Bar which have been very popular over summer.

And as a last note, I'm travelling to San Francisco in a little over a month for the wedding of a dear friend, but would like to put the call out to any Wildilocks fans in the area to drop me a line and say hi if you'd like to catch up, as I will be around for a little less than a week.

Cheers & bye for now!
xo
Cass @ Wildilocks"

"event","Hey everyone, Cass here. It's been a while since we had a substantial update in the world of Wildilocks on the blog - and now is that time. It's with both a relieved and heavy heart as well as a forward facing stride that I bring the latest news from this little alternative corner of the world. 

<lj-cut>Firstly - it's hard to believe that Wildilocks began over 10 years ago in a little market stall in Subiaco. There has been a huge amount of change in my life and the lives of others touched by the weirdness that is my unique and somewhat twisted vision of diversity and inclusiveness: but one thing has become very clear in this time. Wildilocks is essentially my baby, and the way I want the world to be for my baby is often not at all aligned with the way the world currently is. With a background in festivals, the alternative scene, busking and travel, and in the last 7 or so years, a very strong affinity and involvement with the Burning Man festival and its' Regional events, much of what I have envisioned for Wildilocks has been at complete odds with what is required for a business to function in this commerce-mediated world: at least, not for it to still be personal, yet reach a wider audience. This has been a monumental struggle for me: I have wished so often for a path to open up with a clear way to do things differently but still co-exist and also grow within the default world's existing structure, but if such a path has been possible, I've not met the right collaborators as yet, and in my experiments to grow and spread the Wildilocks message I have almost inevitably been drawn back to the harsh realities of a world where being an employer is seen in a very particular light and requires many procedures I've struggled with psychologically: especially without cloning technology!! I've attempted to grow Wildilocks within the confines of society and business practice as it currently requires and with the limitation of having only one physical body yet a wider geographical reach: and this has changed me as a person. I'm not at all sure I like the changes; in fact, I think I can say with some confidence that I really don't. This has never been what it's been about for me, and in trying to explain my vision to people and ask them to share in creating it, nurturing it, taking ownership of it and maintaining it, I have not really managed a true, lasting connection, and something has become lost which I've been chasing for some time now. And so much has changed in the past 10 years since this venture began.

The way people are socialising has changed. Where once you really needed to see people in person to catch up and feel you were participating, now you can get a similar feeling any time, any place, staring at your mobile phone screen. People are less motivated to act physically as they are vicariously experiencing their friends' actions and as a result feel simultaneously satiated and envious. Not sure how healthy this is for us, but it's what is happening. While the line between content creators and consumers has blurred, so has the means for surviving in the physical world via physical effort reduced as real physical participation has reduced and virtual representation has increased.

The alternative scene has changed. One could say there's been something of a lull over the past few years, especially in Perth: what was a vibrant gothic scene, some would say the best city in Australia to be going out goth clubbing for most of the 2000's, has been gutted by politics and a city with a fantastic weekly club now has monthly events at best, which many do not attend: total attendance over any period of time, even if monthly events are relatively well attended, is significantly lower. A phoenix has yet to arise from the ashes. While that may still come (and given the historic ebbs and flows of the goth scene, is actually quite likely) that time does not seem to be on the horizon any time soon.

The way people are purchasing has changed. Retail in general has shifted online significantly, and less events also means less demand overall. While Wildilocks was an early leader in online sales, having multiple physical locations has meant this area has been neglected terribly, and our online inventory and marketing has not kept up with the times. 

All this equals an inevitable need for change. And the truth is, the alternative scene is much healthier in Melbourne right now than it is in Perth - not that there hasn't always been a drift from Perth to Melbourne, but the difference has become more pronounced in recent years. So - it is time for a restructure. 

This means: <b>Wildilocks Perth will be going FIFO. Base108 will be ceasing physical trading on 27th April 2013. But THIS DOES NOT MEAN WILDILOCKS IS CLOSING! </b>Far from it!! (and our Melbourne salon is going strong as ever with two lovely new staff and some of the craziest Saturdays we've seen in years!). However, it does mean there is going to be more competition for appointments in Perth, as Wildilocks from this date will be hosted @ Identified Hair in Kensington (just a hop, skip and a jump from the CBD, south of the river). Jude @ Identified Hair is one of very few career hairdressers I have met who I feel understands and supports the Wildilocks ethos, and while Jude's thing is a little different to mine, she is very keen to provide Wildilocks with a base to continue servicing our loyal clients with the best dreadlocks and extensions in Perth (and indeed, the world). Not only that but you will be guaranteed the absolute best service as I will be seeing all clients personally. This restructure means that appointments for dreadlocks and extensions installs and maintenance will agenerally need to be booked more in advance (eventually possibly up to 8 weeks but initially up to 4 weeks) and most will require an advance payment of a deposit as appointment slots will be be more precious and no-shows cannot be accommodated (if you are a regular with no no-shows o cancellations, this may be waived). Rates will <i>not</i> be increasing, and will continue at $95 per hour with our guaranteed price freeze continuing into 2014 at least. I may also consider some mobile appointments depending on location. So do not fear, your Wildilocks fix is still going to be very much available! We will also be maintaining the Perth phone number to keep booking and enquiries easy as pie (mmm, pie), but email bookings and consults will also be highly encouraged. As of what will be happening with the Base108 premises? Was wondering if you'd ask. There will actually be a salon taking over the premises - but it is going to be a barber salon and they will not be providing Wildilocks services, though I have been told they are skilled in hair tattoos, as well as providing more mainstream urban streetwear and a possible recording studio - for those of you who remember the premises when Narcissist were there, it looks to be a return more to the kind of thing they were doing. So the spirit of 108 Barrack St is evolving, too - just in a different direction now. 

As is usual when there is any change, and also because we're a little overdue for one anyway, from this Saturday in both Perth AND Melbourne, we will be having: OUR BIGGEST SALE IN HISTORY! This is because we need to ship as little as possible over to Melbourne as we consolidate our stock, plus we need to make room to fit everything in once there, so I am pleased to announce, for ONE WEEK ONLY from April 23rd to 27th, we will be having a ...

<b>MEGA-ENORMOUS-WEEK-LONG-HUGE-STOCK-RELOCATION-SALE:

BUY ONE, GET TWO FREE for A WHOLE WEEK.</B>

Yes you read that correctly, BUY ONE GET *TWO* FREE (this is for all clothing, boots and accessories in stock, free items must be equal or lesser value than purchased one) for a WHOLE WEEK. This is an absolutely, guaranteed, 100% WILL NOT BE REPEATED SALE! For Perth it will be your last chance to try items on, though in the coming months many many items not currently on the Webstore will be added though, so all is not lost.

We have a couple of other BIG pieces of news. As part of the restructure, Wildilocks will now be allocating resources to wholesaling & distributing Special Effects and Directions hair colours within Australia & New Zealand! If you are a hair professional or an alternative store and wish to have immediate access to our new trade prices, please contact us on wholesale@wildilocks.com - we will be creating a whole new website section for this new aspect of the business - we will also be adding quantity discounts to our retail webstore too. Please note that Special Effects currently have several colours out of stock which won't be restocked for several months so our Wholesale Section won't be launched til after all colours are full available once more (even though this happens a couple of times a year almost like clockwork, we are hoping to head that off by increasing our stock levels once wholesaling). Not only that, but for those of you who are concerned with availability of the brands we stock once we have moved - don't be! We will be shipping at least 3 days a week from now on, plus Identified Hair is not only providing a home for Wildilocks in Perth, they are also happily providing a home for Special Effects too, so you can find these now in salon @ Identified Hair - Jude is also happy to provide Special Effects colour services in salon too at any time, not just when Wildilocks is being hosted.

Now, looking ahead and what's coming up in the not distant future. Wildilocks has been asked to be involved with <b>World Goth Day</b> celebrations @ DV8 in Melbourne - we'll be outfitting some gorgeous gothic models and raising a toast to everything dark and delicious in Australia's Goth Capital City on May 18th. More details to come soon on this. 

Please note we WILL be closed on the 25th of April for Anzac Day in Melbourne but will be open in Perth for the sale so those of you who have the day off but might not be able to come down otherwise, can have a chance :) 

We will also be looking to revive our ""Treats"" blog and Youtube channel which has been languishing for far too long due to lack of time and resources: watch for some awesome new additions over the coming months. 

Lastly, I would like to thank each and every one of you who has been involved with the evolution of Wildilocks in Perth in some way in the past 10 years who have appreciated and understood the vision of Wildilocks to not just beautify the alternative world, but take a stand for those who have no choice in being perceived as ""different"": by consciously choosing to appear strange and unusual, you are making a political statement to the mainstream, and helping encourage acceptance and diversity. I am still walking that path proudly after all these years, and hope to keep doing so with you all for many years to come. I am really looking forward to reconnecting and maintaining that connection in a more personal way with many more people in both Perth and Melbourne over the coming years thanks to this change.

Pop in if you can this coming week to grab a bargain and say goodbye to Base108, to witness this particular Wildilocks chapter in closing, and welcoming in the new.

We will be closed for Tuesday 18th & Wed 19th September and will be reopening on Thursday 20th September, if all goes well, at 347 Victoria St North Melbourne (West Melbourne for Google Maps/mail)! We will confirm via Twitter when doors are officially open at the new premises :D

Note Perth is trading as normal during this time, and we look forward to seeing you in both locations as we move forward in this exciting change!"

"event","Been a little while since we've had an update here (or on Twitter - meep!) - this is because there have been a lot of changes for Wildilocks in the wings, and we are finally able to officially announce two pretty big pieces of news. 

Firstly, it is with regret that I must announce that Wildilocks has made the decision to sell our Wellington salon, and while the new owner will be continuing with Farouk Systems CHI range of ammonia free colour & styling products, as well as continuing to supply Directions and Special Effects in store, they will be adding beauty services and the fashion section will be relocated back to Australia. Francia will also be offering extension services, but not dreadlocks. We wish Francia all the best and are confident our existing Wellington clientele will be serviced very well. This will leave Cass with the ability to focus more on the Australian salons which have been hard to manage with three all to keep an eye on! We will however continue our TradeMe sales, but from Australia, so there will be longer and slightly more expensive shipping, but still - available! So look forward to more regular updates, more new products, more specials and more interactivity!

This means also that <B>for the next week, Wildilocks @ Cuba is having a BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE SALE on all clothing, boots and accessories in-store</B> (second item must be of equal or lesser value.)  Our final trading day for clothing will be Wednesday 27th June, and Francia will be reopening after some refit with the addition of beauty, on Thursday 5th July. Phone number will stay the same, and we will forward any email enquiries made after this date to her. Any vouchers not yet used have been agreed to be honoured by Francia, but all laybys or store credits for clothing & accessories must be completed by 27th June.  Goodbye Wellington - we will miss you :(

And so - now for the fantastic news! 

We are really excited to be able to announce that Wildilocks in Melbourne will be MOVING this year! We have lined up a fantastic new location and we are very pleased to say we will be opening<B> our first ever street-frontage location in Australia!</B> We won't be opening in the new location until September, but we will be getting our refit  started nice and early (in fact it has already started...:) ) 

The new shop will be located at 347 Victoria St, North Melbourne (<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps?q=347+VictoriaSt+West+melbourne&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=34.945679,66.972656&hnear=347+Victoria+St,+West+Melbourne+Victoria+3003,+Australia&t=m&z=16"">West Melbourne on Google Maps</a>.) almost at the corner of Errol St, in the heart of the North Melbourne shopping precinct, and the 57 tram stops within metres of our front door, so while we will be a little further out, we're a lot easier to find and much more accessible.  Only 10 minutes walk from Queen Victoria Markets, North Melbourne or Flagstaff Train Stations (or 15/20 minutes to Melbourne Central) - and actually only a 25 minute walk from our current CBD location in Little Collins St.  There's also MUCH easier parking for those of you driving. So this is something we are hugely excited for. We are considering opening one Sunday a month for the <a href=""http://northmelbournemarket.com"">North Melbourne Market</a> days once we are re-situated too, and there may be other minor changes to our trading hours. 

In the meantime Wildilocks @ The Lockworks will continue to trade as normal, and we will let you all know with lots of notice when we will be closing the doors there officially and opening anew! Wildilocks @ Base108 is going strong as always with Emma, Trent, Amy and Damon holding the fort!

We'd also like to confirm when we move to North Melbourne we will NOT be increasing prices  in either salon in Australia - note our hourly rates have not gone up in years, and won't til at least 2013 or possibly 2014.

We look forwarded to keeping you all updated on the progress of the new shop and hope to see you soon."

"event","Hi there dames &amp; dudes! It&#39;s been almost 6 months since our last sale, and so you are probably coming to expect one roughly at these kinds of intervals, amirite?<br /><br /><img src=""http://wildilocks.com/sites/default/files/MARCH2012FLYERsm.pdf.jpg"" /><br /><br />Well, I&#39;m pleased to say those of you answering in the affirmative will not be disappointed this week! We&#39;ve had a massive amount of stock arrive last week and our clothing racks are groaning and stuffed to the gills! &quot;We&#39;ve got no rooooom!&quot; our staff are crying - so what to do?! We&#39;re making room by giving away 1 free item with every 2 purchased (of equal or lesser value) from ALL our clothing stock - ALL THIS WEEK! Yes this is everything this time, NOT just summer stock - this sale includes corsets, skirts, tops, jackets, dresses and more, from ALL our brands including Phaze, Nubia/Vodabox, Dolly Q, Axfords, Timeless Trends, Iblis, SpaceTribe, Chicstar, and our own Locks Gear brand too! We have a lot of fun alternative clothing and even more of the &quot;hippie&quot; type stuff than before as so many of our newer staff have been of this ilk :))<br /><br />Some very sweet new Rockabilly items especially in this haul including skull &amp; roses and Day of the Dead dresses and NEW guy&#39;s shirts that are HOT - little clutch purses and Cherry Halter Neck dresses plus cat trousers, faery sleeve tops &amp; pants, super cute embroidered bustierre tops, lacy shrugs and a whole lot more.<br /><br />So come down anytime between 27-31 March and grab some fabulous frocks and jocks! This sale is first in best dressed - there will be no rainchecks, holds or laybys and this sale will not be extended!<br /><br />Also, as Easter Weekend is coming up soon, we would like to let you know that all Wildilocks stores will be closed on 6-7 April to give our hardworking staff some well earned rest and time to eat chocolate. We will be open as normal on 9th April though :)<br /><br />Hope to see you this week!"

Hey everyone! It's now less than a week til that favourite time of the alternative calendar year: Samhain! Or as tis more commonly celebrated in the Americas: Halloween.

So far Wildilocks has resisted the call to go all out for this particular holiday, though we have occasionally sported a giant arachnid for fun, or dressed up as zombies, but this year, we couldn't help ourselves!

We are for 2011 celebrating the most spooky time of the year with a WEEK LONG HALLOWEEN SALE! That's right, from 25 - 31st October we are offering 20% off ALL clothing & accessories: that includes all pants, tops, jackets, corsets, skirts, hair falls, hats, New Rock Boots, jewelery, EVERYTHING*!  And not only is this at all Wildilocks stores, but it's ONLINE too on our <a href=""http://www.wildilocks.com/webstore"">webstore</a>! AND this sale also counts for orders, so if you've been thinking of buying something, but we don't have it in stock, as long as the order is paid 100% during the sale week, you can get orders for 20% off as well, INCLUDING New Rocks! This is the first and possibly only time we will take 20% off New Rock orders!

And as an extra special added bonus, when you come in to Wildilocks during our Halloween sale, if you come up to the front desk and say ""Trick or Treat"" you will get - well, one or the other!!! So make sure you drop in and say hi, and grab yourself a Halloween bargain!

Have a wonderful week, people - and stay SPOOKY!

<font size=""2"">*not valid for salon services or products, magazines, auctions, or laybys not paid in full during the sale period

<b>Also please note Perth store is closed this Friday and Saturday due to the CHOGM meeting long weekend, so the sale only runs for 3 days in the Perth store, so get in early!</B></font>"

"event","Greetings folks,

We have some <em>amazing</em>, last-minute news: we will have a genuine LIVE TESLA COIL display at Euchronia! This has been quite a thing to organize and we didn't want to announce it until we were pretty sure it would be happening, but we can now confim that senior Physicist Ed Bondarenko, former head of the Telstra Research High Voltage Lab, will be doing live Tesla Coil and Electrostatic Leviation displays throughout the earlier part of the evening, so you'll want to make sure you come early to see this fantastic display of SCIENCE!

We're also quite chuffed to note that we were listed this past weekend as the featured pick for New Years Eve in the Sunday Age: even the city's $2.5M free fireworks display didn't merit that honour!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5302449918_216115af87.jpg"">

We also have two new fine artists added to our already amazing bill: <a href=""http://euchronia.com/christopher-james-percival"">Christopher
James Percival</a> from Perth and <a href=""http://euchronia.com/robo-von-bismark"">Robo von Bismark</a> from right here in Melbourne, with some more amazing artworks for your viewing pleasure. Christopher has also produced some amazing signage work which you'll see around the venue on the night, as well as our spectacular programme book, all new ALTV membership cards (which can be collected on the door) and sundry other designwork. In addition, we also have two new performers to announce: Nikolai and Scarlet will be entertaining you with Fire and Brimstone (or similar &mdash; we expect it will smell better) as you enter the venue, so keep an eye out!

We also wanted to make specific mention of our top-billed dance performer, Magdalene from New Zealand, who will be performing not one but two awesome acts. Her first will be more burlesque and Absinthe-themed (ooh la la!) but the second will be her famous <strong>Cenobite dance</strong>, sure to enthrall and amaze, and as seen at Torture Garden (UK) and the Christchurch Fetish Ball. (This second act is not for the fainthearted and so we're featuring it toward the end of the evening: well worth sticking around for!)

Finally, we can now announce our Drinks Menu for Euchronia, including a range of vintage themed cocktails with recipes from the turn of the century and beyond, and the prices &mdash; well, <a href=""http://euchronia.com/drinks-menu"">see for yourself</a>!

If you're still looking for sartorial inspiration, please check out our <a href=""http://euchronia.com/what-should-i-wear-euchronia"">What to Wear</a> and <a href=""http://euchronia.com/melbourne-neo-victorian-and-steampunk-couturiers"">Where to Get It</a> pages. Importantly, for those of you who're keen to add a Holostatic Aetheric Discombobulator or similar to your accoutrements, we have a much more open policy this time around, and <em>will</em> be permitting prop weapons &mdash; but please ensure you read <a href=""http://euchronia.com/weapons-policy"">the policy</a> carefully.

Please note that tickets can no longer be posted out to you (in case they don't reach you on time), but you can either come in to Wildilocks, Peril Underground or Of Science and Swords to buy your tickets in person up til close of business on the 31st, or you can buy online to pick up on the door from <a href=""http://www.euchronia.com/tickets"">euchronia.com</a>! You can also purchase from <a href=""http://www.moshtix.com.au/event.aspx?id=42752&ref=moshtix"">Moshtix</a> either online or at any Moshtix outlet up til 6pm on the 31st December. (Limited door sales will be available, with preference for ALTV members.)

Looking forward to seeing you on Friday!"

Read on, for there is much to tempt. (If you're already convinced but still ticketless, feel free to skip to the end for details of TICKET DISCOUNTS.)

Finally, we're excited to announce the last minute addition of <a href=""http://euchronia.com/stephanie"">STEPHANIE</a> (CAN) to our performers' bill: a delightful dancer sure to bewitch and enchant.

Many, many of you have already purchased your tickets (and we're particularly overwhelmed by number of interstate visitors this year!), but if you still haven't gotten around to it, or if you're looking for a perfect last-minute gift idea, we're offering a little incentive to buy earlier rather than later.

Euchronia's XMAS SPECIAL: if you buy before 25 December you can receive 2 tickets for only $125, a discount of $15 off current prices (and $45 less than you'll be charged on the door)!

"event","Gosh, it's now less than a month til Euchronia! As in 2008, we've had so many compliments on our 2010 Euchronia poster we felt some information on how it was created would be of interest, even more so than last time. 

Because our 2010 venue is a former power station, we felt a theme of electricity was the most obvious choice - and what better way to do it than with REAL lightning, conjured up just for our use? 

While many may have assumed that the lightning in the image is solely the result of some clever Photoshop - (and yes, our first teaser flyer was indeed all digital) - while there may have been a <I>little</i> bit of image manipulation involved - the reality is, our lovely model Helen was in fact <B>actually</b> being shot with <B>real</b> lightning bolts from a very impressive 2 meter tall Tesla coil! In fact we believe we are the first steampunk group to have had a genuine Tesla coil photoshoot and this is something we're very proud of! To get a bit of an idea of what the shoot looked like, check out the animated gif put together by <a href=""http://www.tesladownunder.com"">Peter Terren</a>, below: 

<a href=""http://tesladownunder.com/SteampunkHelen.gif""><img src=""http://antipodeanleague.org/blog/files/2010/12/steampunkhelen_sm.gif"">
(Click through to see the full size .gif on Peter's site)</a>

If you'd just like to see some of the behind the scenes images, you can check out our Flickr set <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/altv/"">here</a> or Peter Terren's very comprehensive set of images and amusing back-story <a href=""http://tesladownunder.com/steampunknight.htm"">here</a>. 

<lj-cut text=""Read below for information about the many talented people involved in this posters' creation, as well as some blow - by blow descriptions..."">

Of course the star of the show was <a href=""http://www.tesladownunder.com"">Peter Terren of tesladownunder.com</a> and his pride and joy, his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil"">Tesla Coil</a>. Peter's Tesla coil adventures have been featured on TV and in print extensively all over the world, and you have almost certainly seen some of his images online, most likely at the very least his version of <a href=""http://www.tesladownunder.com/#Best photos"">""The Thinker""</a> - his website documents all his shoots and he's done some fantastic images.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5224211555_ddf6faea07.jpg"">

Now, working with Tesla coils involves an inherent risk of injury or death - this is high voltage stuff and not for the fainthearted! Fortunately, Peter set us all at ease by trying everything himself before he put any of our models in the firing line, so we were relatively reassured. 

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5004/5224807108_005f2bc76c.jpg"">

But the reality? If any of us had dropped the prop we were holding or stepped out of the Faraday cage while the coil was running - we could have died. For serious! Safety was paramount, and you can see peter below checking the earthing wire on Helen for one of the first shots:

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4133/5224213261_d975a792c5.jpg"">

While we had a battery of cameras set up for the shoot (4 cameras in total) the photographer we employed specifically for the shoot was Perth photographer and tree-lover, Nonie Jekabsons, who is more likely to be found photographing more natural subject matter (her RedBubble is <a href=""http://www.redbubble.com/people/naia"">here</a>). This was our first shoot with Nonie, and it went very very well. Nonie used two cameras to make sure there was a good range of images to choose from, and with Peter's and Ian's cameras as well, we had a lot of backups!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5224213555_f17831a226.jpg"">

We had several models for the shoot, including Christoper, Ian, Jeremy & Cass, as well as Chris and Peter, and of course Helen, a bastion of the fledgling Perth steampunk scene, who makes wonderful steampunk artifacts that you can find on her website, <a href=""http://www.darknouveau.com.au/"">Dark Nouveau</a>.

Our lovely models provided a fantastic blunderbuss which was a key prop and we were keen to have this prop in the final poster, with just about everyone having a go: 

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5207/5224212583_f358e25778.jpg"">

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5085/5224809012_bb91b5fba6.jpg"">

We also did some images which were actually long exposure ""trick of the eye"" images, where we posed, took a flash image, then ran away while the Tesla coil was turned on: 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5224810360_167f410c2e.jpg"">

But in the end, the image of Helen with the Faraday cage won out, with intense blue light from Peter's brightest bike light in the world. Clothing featured a gorgeous Nubia/Vodabox coat, top hat and the ubiquitous steampunk goggles all available from Wildilocks. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5224812078_0fb258092e.jpg"">

This image was then spliced with another of the lightning bolts, and a few other tricks, to get the finished result:

It was a very exciting and rewarding evening, and thanks so much to everyone who was involved, especially Peter and his lovely wife Jane for showing us such wonderful hospitality!

It is with very great pleasure that we can finally announce a major update to the Euchronia bill, and reveal our new poster (click for <a href=""http://www.euchronia.com/files/euchronia_poster_2010_lrg.jpg"">large version</a>) - which has a fantastic story of its own involving death-defying feats with Tesla Coils c/o the very talented Peter Terren of <a href=""http://www.tesladownunder.com"">Tesla Down Under</a>! But that's a longer story, and deserves an entire post of its own &mdash; which we shall bring you very soon, but not today. Today is dedicated to our exciting new international and interstate attractions!

Next, another international artist from across the ditch - <b>Magdalene</b> has performed in fetish clubs in London and NZ and has more recently been making a splash in the NZ burlesque scene.

And finally for this announcement, the return performance of the fantastic <b>SFORZANDO</b>, the 8-piece pirate punk extravaganza whose 2008 Euchronia set blew the audience away. In their words:

GENRES: 80s, electro, goth, indie, industrial, steampunk, synthpop

The events committee of the Wellington chapter of the Antipodean League of Temporal Voyagers are pleased to announce the inauguration of a new event in this fair city. Rogue will provide an introduction to the Leagues terpsichorean activities and promises an intimate, comfortable experience with cocktail specials and a particularly alternative and danceable soundtrack. If you are in or near Wellington, enjoy musical genres such as electro, 80s, synthpop, futurepop, industrial, goth, EBM and steampunk (though of course whether this actually exists as a musical genre is a matter of some debate), and would value an opportunity to shake out your steamy, goth and industrial finery, please consider joining us for the inaugural Rogue on November 20th, 2010. Entry is a mere $5. Those brave souls who survive All Hallows Eves harrowing Steampunks vs Zombies (www.steampunkvzombies.com) encounter might like to share their tales and display their sartorial and armourial splendour. We would certainly value the opportunity to raise a glass in your honour!"

"event","Dear Internet, 

Wildilocks has been at the fantastic location of 808 Hay St for almost 5 years now. It's been a crazy wild ride and during that time we've had many new staff, and opened two new salons; in Melbourne and just this year, in Wellington, New Zealand. But the time has come to say goodbye to the massive basement which has been the core of Wildilocks for so many years. Our lease is coming to an end, and it's time for a change!

Wildilocks @ Base808 will be relocating to become Base108 - our new address where we will be opening in early November is 108 Barrack St. For anyone who ever went to Narcissist/Next Level Records - that is the space we are moving to! For those who don't know, this is just at the end of the Murray St mall - and almost directly across from the newer Off Ya Tree on Barrack St. The new salon area will be almost twice and big as at Base808, with all brand new furniture, basins and a different look & feel - more opulent and luscious, with a more vintage vibe. It will become our new flagship store with the most styling stations and the biggest floor area!

<img src=""http://wildilocks.com/sites/default/files/moving_sale-web.jpg"">

Now moving all our shop stock over to the new location is something we're <I>really</i> not looking forward to, so Perth is in for a treat - the last one was so successful we've decided to do a much longer one this time around: we're having a whole TWO WEEK long ""buy one get one free"" sale so we don't have to move as much stuff! This will allow for new stock for the new shop, so we hope you'll take advantage of this sale and buy a whole lot of gear - we'd really appreciate it! Please note the sale is for in stock items only (no orders or lay-bys).


We will officially close our doors on Hay St on October 27th, and re-open at 108 Barrack St between November 1st - 3rd.

We look forward to seeing you!"

"event","Pre-release tickets for Euchronia 2010 have been selling like astonishingly fast-selling things! We've managed to catch some folks a little on the hop however, as certain corners of the Internet are only now learning that Euchronia will be happening again this New Year's Eve. In order not to disadvantage these benighted souls, we have decided to extend the pre-release period for one additional week.

Pre-release tickets which have already been purchased will be posted out early next week, and standard release tickets will go on sale on the 19th October - in physical outlets as well as online. Until then, pre-release tickets will remain available from the tickets page on the <a href=""http://www.euchronia.com/tickets"">Euchronia tickets page</a>, or from the <a href=""http://wildilocks.com/webstore/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=80"">Wildilocks webstore</a>!

The Antipodean League of Temporal Voyagers is pleased to confirm that our Year's End celebration <i>Euchronia</i> will take place again this year. We invite persons of quality and taste to join with us in celebrating the dawn of 2011 in a pageant of sartorial and terpsichorean exuberance.

The managing committee will be delighted to entertain performance proposals suited to the spirit of the event. Interested parties are encouraged to contact admin@euchronia.com. The committee propose to provide additional details concerning the evening's entertainment, and to make a first tranche of tickets available for sale, on the 27th of September, 2010. (Additionally, League memberships will once again be made available from that date.)

We look forward with anticipation to the privilege of your company."

"event","Hey there!

Wildilocks is looking for a model for chemical straightening next Tuesday 17th August, for a demonstration by fully qualified stylist. This is with an *ammonia free* chemical straightening system, so it's less damaging than standard straightening. You would pay for cost of product only (approx $30), and ideally have short-medium length hair (not long). Appointment would take a little longer than usual as it is for training purposes. If you're keen or know anyone ese who might be, please reply to this post or call our Cuba St salon on 04 803 3239 asap!"

We've had many more folks through as well and even more excitement on the horizon - a very near horizon is coming up rapidly, too...

"event","Very exciting news, folks! Wildilocks @ Cuba is now officially open for all services! 

The new salon is located at 225 Cuba St, Te Aro, Wellington, New Zealand (just up from Vivian St, next to Cafe Italiano and opening partly into the foyer of the Quality Comfort Hotel). Opening hours are 10am - 5pm Tues, Wed and Sat, and 10am - 7pm Thu and Fri. You can call us on (04) 803 3239 for appointments of enquiries, and you will be able to find all your favourite Wildilocks services, accessories and items at our new Cuba St location. We'll have Kate, our travelling stylist, manning the helm for at least the first 6 months, following on from stints in both or Melbourne and Perth stores, and our new locla stylists are Dominique and Charlotte, two very talented young ladies with a whole lot to give and much excitement to be part of the Wildilocks team.

We'd like to make special note that Wildilocks is the first salon to bring the Farouk Systems CHI range to Wellington, a more environmentally friendly and healthy option for permanent hair colour and hair lightening with ammonia free colour. We are also bringing Everescents, a fantastic 100% organic range of hair care products, as well as our favourite wild hair colours, Special Effects and Directions. If you haven't tried any of these brilliant products yet, whether you're really out there crazy colourwise, or more subtle, or perhaps you don't even colour your hair but want to look after it in the healthiest and most environmentally friendly way - there's something for you @ Wildilocks and we'd love to show you how much better our products are than the mainstream. 

Good news for Kiwis who'd like to mail order too: we'll be able to ship from our <a href=""http://www.wildilocks.com/webstore"">webstore</a> for a cheaper price for many items (please note that we will give a refund when items are available to ship from NZ as we do still have greater stock of most items in  our two Oz stores). 

We look forward to welcoming you to our newest, shiniest salon and hope to see you soon!"

"event","Hi everyone, 

All's been very quiet on the communication front from Wildilocks due to a number of major changes & happenings with us. We apologise for being so silent for some time, but we've been working tirelessly on some very exciting stuff! I'll let you know about all that is new and shiny with us below. 

________
<B>New Staff!</b>

Unfortunately Rob has left our Perth team but taking his role is our amazing new principal stylist Laura, who has been receiving rave reviews from existing and new clients! Laura started with us toward the end of February and has been picking up new fans ever since. She's pictured below with a huge bouquet of flowers friends had sent her during her first week to congratulate her on her exciting new position!

<img src=""http://wildilocks.com/sites/default/files/laura_sm.jpg"">

We also have a new junior recruit at our Melbourne store, but we'll keep quiet on that until she joins us for permanent if things go well :) 

_________________________
<B>New Label - Skin Graft Designs!</b>

<a href=""http://skingraftdesigns.com/gallery/collection/women-s-spring-summer-09""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/2842781587_88356d8658.jpg""></a>

Yes, you read that correctly, Wildilocks has recently become the first Antipodean stockist of the almost unbearably beautiful <B><a href=""http://skingraftdesigns.com/gallery/collection/women-s-spring-summer-09"">Skin Graft Designs</a></b>. For those not familiar, Skin Graft have created some of the most incredible wearable works of art of recent times; and have recently made a selection of their designs available in a variety of fabrics, including some of the most supple leather I have ever touched. Selected items from the <a href=""http://skingraftdesigns.com/gallery/collection/women-s-spring-summer-09"">latest collections</a> including gorgeous Victorian-inspired blouses, halters, jackets and more are now available at our Melbourne and Wellington stores!
________________________
You what - <B>WELLINGTON????</b>

Yes, you read that correctly too. Wildilocks' stealthy international expansion plan for World Domination (TM) begins reasonably close to home in the stunning capital of New Zealand, <B>Wellington</b>. While our exact opening date is still a week or two away, we'll make a new post to let you know all the details, address, opening hours, specials etc as soon as we are confirmed ready to roll. Expect all your favorite Wildilocks specialities including dreadlocks, extensions, crazy cuts and colours and wild, wild clothing in store - and in a whole new currency! Our very lovely training manager Ms Kat will be there at the start to train our new Kiwi staff, and the ever intrepid miss Kate who has spent most of the last year assisting at our Perth salon, will be along shortly after to assist in settling Wildilocks in well in our new home. We hope you'll make us welcome, Wellingtonians!

Here's a sneak peak to get you excited about the new salon: 

<img src=""http://wildilocks.com/sites/default/files/salonwellingtonsm.jpg"">

______
<B>Events!</b>

Wildilocks would like to applaud Circa Nocturna for yet another amazing year: unfortunately due to staff commitments in both the USA and New Zealand there was not a strong showing of Wildilocks hair in this years' parade, but we were very happy to serve as a ticket stockist and want to congratulate the team for their hard work. You can see many great Circa 2010 pics over at SuperKawaiiMama's blog <a href=""http://www.superkawaiimama.com.au/2010/03/12/circa-nocturna-2010/"">here</a>.

The next event you can purchase tickets through Wildilocks on the calendar is the return to Perth and the inaugural invasion of  Melbourne: <B>SPANK</b>! Finally, SPANK! crosses from West to East as Wildilocks did several years back - and I'm sure they'll do just as well! Come grab tickets for fetish fashion fun & games: Melbourne's first event is themed ""Doctors & Nurses"" and is set for Saturday 15th May at the <I>Martini Lounge</i> (formerly <I>Dream</i>); then Perth on 29 May @ Gilkisons, with the theme ""Weimar Berlin"".

<B>Travels!</b>

While we won't be able to do any hair-on-the-move on this trip, Cass will be heading to Europe next month to check out the local steampunk scene and keep an eye out for new suppliers and style! If you have a fashion line you'd be interested in getting internationally stocked, are an alternative hair stylist with an interest in heading to the Antipodes at some stage in future and would like to talk about opportunities, or otherwise think you may have something we may be interested in - send an email to cass@wildilocks.com asap! We'll be travelling through Eastern Europe then Berlin, Glasgow, Edinburgh and London; as well as Whitby toward the end of the month. Hope to meet some of you on our travels!

_________
<B>Other news...</b>

We've had a lot of trouble with our Special Effects supplies of late, a little more than usual. We'd like to apologise for so many colours being out of stock for so long: if there's anything more we could do, we would! Hopefully this situation will resolve soon and we'll have all colours back in stock within a few weeks. Thankyou for your patience!

But in more positive news, we've <I>finally</i> found some lovely Victorian style top hats and riding hats for gents, after much lamenting their lack - these should be arriving in Melbourne in a week or two, and other stores shortly after, along with some lovely new Phaze jackets. We also plan to have a few New Zealand new designers on board in the not distant future. Keep watching this space for details!

Cheers, 

Cass"

"event","Yes, you read right! We're doing some product demos next Wednesday the 9th December, and we are in need of 3-4 models - with absolutely NO cost - most of our colour models need to pay for product, but not this time!

We are seeking people with any length hair up to bra strap length and would like an example of each of the following, ideally: 

Platinum blonde
Deep rich red
Random bright colour
Natural brown shade


What's the catch? Well, we do require you to please follow up with us in 2 weeks and 4 weeks time for us to see the longevity of the colour over time. SO ideally you'd be able to pop by the salon easily during the week. That's it! 

If you would like any supplementary services like cuts, style blowdry, extensions or any other service, you will need to pay for those. But $0 for colour!

Please call our Perth salon on 9226 3722 from 10am tomorrow to grab one of these spots."

It's been a little while since our last general update, and we've got loads of news! Lots of new products in store, and events and announcements and goings-on. So without further ado:

<i><b>Events News</b></i>:

<b><a href=""http://www.earthlydelights.com.au/victorian2.htm"">Victorian Era Dance &amp; Costume Festival, Canberra</a></b> - October 2-5th, 2009

Wildilocks is proud to be presenting a workshop on Victorian Hairstyling as part of the Victorian Era Festival for 2009, held by the <a href=""http://www.earthlydelights.com.au/"">Earthly Delights Historical Dance Academy</a>. The festival focuses on Victorian era partner dances &amp; costuming, and has many workshops on a wide variety of Victorian pursuits such as bonnet making, etiquette, needlework, a Graveyard Tour, and there's even a talk on Steampunk! You can see the full program for the weekend <a href=""http://www.earthlydelights.com.au/vef2009.pdf"">here</a> [pdf], and there's still time to register and attend this wonderful event!

<b><a href=""http://rollerderbyvictoria.wikispaces.com/"">Victorian Roller Derby League</a></b>

If you haven't yet attended a VRDL bout - you need to check this out. Wildilocks is now an official ticket outlet selling tickets to VRDL local bouts, check out their <a href=""http://rollerderbyvictoria.wikispaces.com/"">website</a> for details of upcoming events!

<b><a href=""http://www.euchronia.com/"">Euchronia</a></b>

OK, we've been getting emails, calls and people in store @ Wildilocks asking us: is there going to be a Euchronia this year?

After significant deliberation and consideration for 2009, we've decided that, in keeping with our aim to maintain Euchronia as a unique and truly world class event, it would ideally be held every <i>other</i> year, rather than annually. So, let the anticipation really begin to build early, and please mark your calendar for <b>December 31, 2010</b>!

In the meantime, the <a href=""http://www.antipodeanleague.org/"">Antipodean League of Temporal Voyagers</a> will be looking into more local events, and directing your support to steampunk goodness around the hemisphere.

<i><b>Stock News</b></i>:

We have many more items constantly becoming available so do pop in store to check out what's new.

<i><b>Staff News</b></i>:

Two new staff members since last bulletin! We have had the very talented <b>Madison</b> join us in Melbourne midway through her training and she is a very bright star. And our youngest staff member <b>Evie</b> has become our newest apprentice in Perth. Both have been with us now for a few months and have been settling in excellently.

That's about all for now - we hope to see you soon!"

"event","Hey folks, 

We're after a few models @ The Lockworks for some training & filming sessions for <a href=""http://www.wildilocks.com/treats"">Wildilocks Treats</a> coming up over the next month. These are for Victorian classical period hairstyles, and we're looking for gals with at least shoulder length hair, preferably in lighter colours as these show more detail than black. If you think you fit the bill and are free Wednesday afternoons, are happy to sign a model release and sit for a few hours being made bootiful, please give us a call asap on (03) 9642 3384 and we'll lock you in! 

Also, for those eagerly awaiting, Coilhouse #3 arrived this morning and is available for purchase both instore and <a href=""http://wildilocks.com/webstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=37_81&products_id=317"">online</A>."

Tons of awesome stuff and of course, featuring a variety of articles on various aspects of Steampunk, including an interview with Doctor Steel, our very own The Tenth Stage, the delectable Kate O'Brien's lush and steamy photography, and simply <i>lashings</i> of Steampunk fashion!<br /><br />What we're really pleased and excited about though, is a collaboration for the first time between Wildilocks and Fiend, as we present the inaugural Fiend Exclusive <i><a href=""http://www.wildilocks.com/treats/"">Wildilocks Treats</a></i> how-to article, &quot;Steampunk Glamour&quot; - the full text is <i>solely</i> available in Fiend while issue #18 is current. For a taste, see our accompanying how-to videos on youtube <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/my_videos"">here</a> - or view the whole series embedded @ <a href=""http://www.wildilocks.com/treats/?p=43"">Wildilocks Treats</a>...  and if you would like the accompanying written instructions &amp; stunning finished pics, grab yourself a copy of Fiend, pronto! Being Steampunk focused, I won't be at all surprised if this issue sells out fast.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Cass<br />"

"event","So, Burning Man has been a huuuuuuugely important part of the last 3 years of my life, and it's amazed me how much my <a href=""http://wildilocks.livejournal.com/287557.html"">earliest</a> <a href=""http://wildilocks.livejournal.com/424378.html"">interests</a>, long before getting anywhere near the playa, and in the most curiously serendipitous manner (thanks to <lj user=""syncretin""/>, it has to be said), ended up smack bang in the middle of my core experience.

Well, this year looks to be shaping up to be an awesome year. We will be camping with a new camp which is rising from the ashes of Spike's Vampire Bar - <b>Rathskellar</b>. Recipe, as described on the <a href=""http://www.rathskellar.org"">website</a>: 

<i>Recipe for Rathskellar

Ingredients:

    1 part Mad Scientist
    1 part Classic Monster Movies
    1 part Hellraiser Movies
    1 part Steampunk
    1 hell of a dash of SEXY

Directions:

Toss all ingredients together in a blender, set to frapp&eacute;. Once properly blended for intoxicated lunacy, pour into a massive, I-can&rsquo;t-possibly-finish-this tankard.  Garnish with a strip of bacon. Finish with a float of Bacardi 151 and set aflame.

Drink. Repeat. Cheers!</i>

Looks to be shaping up to be as much and possibly MORE fun than last year, and the camp is <b>holding a fundraiser THIS WEEKEND @ DNA Lounge</b> (Sat June 20th), which unfortunately I can't be a part of - but would like to alert all of you in the Bay Area to please be considering going to. And if you could please spread the word to any of your Bay Area friends, that would be AWESOME! Flyer is below and website full details are <a href=""http://www.rathskellar.org"">hyar</a>, reposting hugely appreciated!

Last call, last call! There's only 24 hours left to book for the illustrious <a href=""http://antipodeanleague.org/blog/queens-birthday-dinner/"">Queen's Birthday Eve Dinner Voyage</a>! We've got a complement of dashing proportions already on board, but there are still a few seats available. We know in these harder economic and wintry times that it's a stretch for some, but we refuse to be bowed! Come join us in a most memorable and exclusive event: the opportunity to ride with such a well dressed and distinguished company as we will be entertaining is rare indeed.

Ticket page is <a href=""http://antipodeanleague.org/blog/queens-birthday-dinner/"">here</a>!"

"event","Egads! We've been informed by the Powers That Be that we must finalise our ticket sales 14 days in advance of the Tram Voyage, not 48 hours as we'd previous been advised! This means there are only 10 days til the cutoff date, and for those of you waiting til the last minute hoping tickets might still be available (as is not at all uncommon in our subcultural milieu!) - we are terribly sorry but we will not be able to indulge that potential for this event.  2/3 of tickets have been fully booked & confirmed, but we still have a few seats available that haven't been reserved (and reserved tickets which have not been paid for may be re-allocated if necessary), so if you've been dragging your delicately (or handsomely) booted feet, hop to it and purchase tickets either online or @ The Lockworks asap! We'll post one more reminder 24 hours before ticket sales end, but this is your penultimate warning duly given!"

"event","Circa Nocturna last night was amazing - some awesome steampunk stuff included! If you managed to miss the show, don't worry, all is not lost! You can come down in just a few hours to Carnivale Nocturna to meet the designers, see the oufits up close, shop, enjoy a bevvy or two and see some GREAT professional performers, all for the low low price of a gold coin donation - or free with your Circa ticket. Squee!

<p>There is <B>The Girl From East Brunswick fundraiser tonight @ The East Brunswick Club</b>. I&#8217;m not that fussed about dogs generally, but I think if you have to like dogs, Greyhounds are pretty awesome (they&#8217;re almost cats), and it&#8217;s AIR CONDITIONED (though I&#8217;ve been told the band room will get pretty hot regardless, the Front Bar is apparently nice n coooool) and the delectable miss Rosy Rabbit is headlining the bill - and I&#8217;ll actually be able to relax and enjoy the show instead of running about like a headless chicken like I was @ Euchronia. </p>
<p>Who&#8217;s in? We&#8217;ll probably be getting there around 8-9ish <img src='http://wildilocks.canhasjournal.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

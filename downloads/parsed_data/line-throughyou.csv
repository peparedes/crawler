So i have to go wiht my mom whereever she goes. And sally. I dont even want to think about that. I really don't. I just want to sleep. I want to get stoned. I want to be someplace with people i know where i feel safe, and loved. Not here,but not anywhere else imight have to stay. I dont want to leave this awful place anymore.I want to stay,i dont care, i just dont want things ot be so bad. I was selfish, i thought only about myself, not sally, not my mom, not anyone. Just me. I just wanted freedom, no rules. A dumb idiot who couldnt stop me.  A room, which i would put locks on either side of the door tostop anyone form entering when im not in it, or when i am. Enough money every week... to buy what? More freedom? Fun? Yea. Everything i wanted. But thats never gonnahappen, im self destructive and the worlds out to get me, and no one gives. But one day soon i wil prevail, i will keep things moving forward, trying new things, never giving up, never getting scared off. Nothing can stop me now :/
Im listening to MM Holy wood. I love it, doesnt make me think of anyguys, any family, any friends, any pain, any memories. Good or bad, both are evil, both hurt you, the good ones are worst because theymkae oyu long for the real thing.
Monday, im leaving at lunch and getting stoned, i need to... hopefully i'll find someone to join me. Now i will sleep, badly, and wake early for anew awful day. Good night folks."

I dont feel like writing stupid things about stupid things. I'll post shit whne it happens, so i can remeber it, cuz i hate forgetting those little details that are so importent. Other wise, i will stop updateing crap. Like This. Well, last crap thing. Tommorrow I am going into the city, i will arrive at 12. I think i will go to union b/c its right near Irving, and a bunch of peoples houses where everyone seems to hang out these days, and ti sbassicly the only place i can go and hope not to be alone for hours. Lara said she'lljust call me when she goes into the city tommorrow, which could be at any time. Margarita, havent had a achance to talk to her. I'm gonna see if alanna wants to hang out. I was hopeing it would be one big group, but whatever. And hell isnt online, so i cant ask him if he wants to go get stoned tommorrow or something. Cuz thats what i wanna do tommorrow, buy or get free drugs and do them. Pot though, anything else... it would have to seriosuly be the right situation with the right people.
last week was of rfalling in love, this weekend was for getting your heart broken...whats this week gonna be? Falling in love again? Turning gay/straight? One night stands? The world is shit, my friends. It hates us all."

<strike>INCREMENTS
some people don't know what they want out of life so they fall in love instead with vultures and hyenas who'll only love them when they're dead just when you think your safe one falls on your head you can die all of a sudden or you can do it in increments instead a promise is a lie in a time-release pill the things you say you will never do you eventually will and the vultures and hyenas must be patient and be still for lovers don't leap off of cliffs they just slowly go downhill</strike>

I sorta brokedown last night...overeacted, got pissy, just complelty frustrated. I know he's a tease, i knew that from theminute i met him. I didnt care... he was just cool, a friend, yea i  liked him, but i never thought i would end up liking him this much. Its fucking sick. And not in my normal way, no, its notlike i just stalk him or osmething.  Eh, i dont care, i just dont wanna fuck upour friendship. Or act stupid. Cuz if i did that, it would be worse. I just can't forget feelinghappy. No one makes me happy. Why does he have to? Bad luck, i guess. :/
Today, i woke up sick. Felt like i was gonna puke. Almost started crying. Every few mintues another wave would hit me... and i would feel worse. Slowed down by history. Paul... Natasha... i laughed so hard... laughing at peoples awful luck made me less unhappy...
Randomly started hitting tihngs, breaking things throughout firt half of day... i think i hav osme anger issues. Left atlunch. With alanna, rita, anjelica. To go to this kid whos a friend of nicos house...i only rmeber nico cuz ivemet him before. One blunt, thats it for like six of us... ha. Good shit though, felt it fast, and at first i really felt an actual high feeling, before the drowsy/outofit/tired feeling i normally get. It shoudlnt be called a high, it should be called a low, cuz thats how it feels. But not in a bad way.
Discussed with some friends... now have people to get free&buy drugs from, not involving hell. anything i want. allunder 20$. so i can afford it. so i dont need him for drugs anymore.not that i wont want to get high w/ him still.
After leaving that guys house, went to arlins. Lara and logan were there. Arlins fucking apartment,,, bigger than any ive ever lived in. I think logan was fucking around with a guitar when i came in, but we moved into arlins room pretty fast after that. Logan likes Lara... if i wernt so preocupied with my own issues, i would be jealous.
fuck i have no more time thats all for tonight."

"event","I dont want to hang out wiht my mom tommorrow. I want to go to school. Fuck. This sucks. I hate this. But im happy anyway. Heres a list of all the good things about moving.
Why i am really fucking happy to be moving to my dads:
- I have more freedom
- Hes dumber and will believe my lies
- I will get to keep my allowence
- I will get dsl andso now i can download music and go online more
- He has cable (Ifc, sundance, mtv2, vh1 classics... i miss cable)
- There is a working oven in his apt. I do not currently have that. 
- My ownroom wiht a door, i think there is a lock on it, and i could put another one on it anyways.
- I wont have to deal with my mom anymore
- I can invite people to my house, when my dads at work, its just an apt, but its something. 
- There are stores open past midnight...no stores are open in ridgewood past midnight that you could walk to.
- If i want to, my dad can drive me to school instead of subway.
- I'll be like... 40 blocks/3 train stops away from parkslope, so  I can han gout wiht Lara if i want to easier, and actually talk to kids form there again... wait, why would i want to do that... i truely dont know, but still, its an option.
- All of the teachers and school records have my moms adress/number on them, so if i do get in trouble they cant call home or send letters. Ha.
- He doesnt hate my friends or resent the fact that i have them, so he will let me actually go into the city on weekends and stay afterschool and live a real life, fuck that rocks.

There are only two bad things aobut my dads place 1) I have ot wake up ealier(no big deal, i wake uplike 2 hrs b/f my alarm clock goes off anyways) 2)I might have to take the train with sara some days, she likes like 4 or 5 blocks form ym dads house."

It involved many bottles of stolen alchohol, white frosting, pez (fun!), alanna's brothers pot, and rosavelt island. And i cut myself trying to opent he frosting with a straightedge, ow. Bassiccly alot of fun. Then afterwards, stumbled to Margarita's house for a few min, then over to virgin... no one was there at first, then joe &etc came to meet some people, realized that bobby is truely and utterly repulsive in every conceivable way, why the fuck do they hang out with him? Hell wasnt with them, which made me sad, (yea, i know, im stupid, seeing him makes me happier, even if its only for a few secods/miunutes). Left, went down to get ont he train, had to exit the station and go to a dif one cuz my card was empty, told the asshole sint he booth my card was shit,t hey let me through, ran into hell as he was going up the stairs from the L. My luck, i supose.

"event","Packed upa few boxes yesterday and today... didn't tape em shut cuz i might need osmething from them. Over all, i dont have very many things is this apartment. Maybe about 4 small boxes, scattered books and cds mostly, and some journals. I have my makeup, my clothes. One or two stuffed animals. My bed takes up most of my room. There are quite a few unopened boxes, filled wiht shit i grew out of and dont want anymore, maybe two books i still will read, the rest are worthless. My mom pushed the date we move back tot he end of febuary, because she doesnt have any idea of where we can stay, but she may move it up again to january if she cant pay rent this month. I can stay at my dads, but my mom is ""dead to him"" and should ""stop askign him to do shit for her since he hates her and she is not his responsibility, i am"" (im glad he got that clear in his head though) so she cannot stay there. If i go, i have my room (which is usually empty, or filled with storage... its even painted, from a year or so ago when i stayed there for a month or two...). I have all of my shit off my walls, most of it was taken down a couple of months ago when my mom pulled a major freak out ""you have to leave"", so all that was left was an add for thursdya, a sum41 mag cover, and the insert from the Harold and Maude dvd. I just want to go or stay, or go someplace new. All my life everything has been back and forth, we have to do something <b>right now</b> or give it a few days. Its never planned, never orderly. And   everything that happens push the envelope alittle bit, but never go over the edge. Its awful. Thats why I am constantly afriad, as well as my dad, as well as the guy across the street, as well as my moms friends steff. In her own words she ""causes that kind of reaction when she gets to know people."" because they are always afraid, and are fucking nervous/paranoid/stressed because of her, and she always makes them believe <i> this is the time i actually will do it, i will ruin everything</i> 
I just wish the threats would stop, that i would safly be able to say ""I will be living here for the next week, and i can plan on going to school in two days, and I will be able to take a shower and read some of my book later tonight"". Nothing i say, plan, do, is ever acomplished on a scheduale. What i want to do is not importent, what the school says is not importent, what my dad says is not importent. She has the final say, she can do anything the fuck she wants. 

I wish i could live with my dad, and hang out after school for a few ehours at least thre times a week, i wish i could go into the city bymyself, or go han gout wiht firends on weekends, i wish  i could use the computer when i need to, or have a few extraminutes to finish something importent to me. I wish i could keep my allowence, and nothave to go to the supermarket and the deli twice or three times a day to get my mom ciggarettes ""I only smoke one and a half packs a day"" Where do the other two go? ""Those are for tommorrow"" but you made me go and get anothe rpack when i woke up thismorning, at nine, and you will tommorrow ""I dont smoke that much, only when im stressed"" Yea, well ive been stressed my whole life. I dont need ciggarettes. 

I need to actually focus in school... i havent done homewokr in god knows how long, and i dont even know if there has been any. School work... dont finish that. And i go to class mostly, i only cut lit on tuesday. And im not cutting anymore, at least for a week or two until i know whats going on. I dont have anywhere to go if i cut anyway, i only go wiht lara to sephora (urban is out cuz she got caught), since i havent hung out with hell in a while, i doubt i'll go wiht him to coreys house or to b&n or anything...he deosnt show at my school anymore, or  if he does i dont see him, probly cuz he doesnt want me to. 

Ive been so tired lately... if i get to sleep after 10:30, im zoned out and too tired to do work the next day. I never ge tot go online till 11, or read, or write in my journal, or do any kind of work, orlisten to music until then. When i try im baggered into sitting doing nothing angry.

Some one called me at like 1 30 am last night. The number was blocked, so i dont knw who it was. It wasporbly a wrong number... i was asleep so i didnt hear it. People who call me should leave messages, i do check them, and if i dont recognixze a nuber or its blcoked i usally wont pick it up cuz i dont trsut people (coughcoughxianand chloe in 7th gradecough) with my numbers. If anyone i kno was calliing me, the onyl people who leave messages are my mom and my dad, none of my friends... so that leaves anyone. Well, i guess i'll figure it out eventually, but it doesnt matter.


I love Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, That guy from depeche mode, Ian Curtis, Gavin Rosdale, Lestat&Louis&Armand, Jack Skellington, and i want to move to new orleans.

Miss friends, especially the ones ihavetn seen or hung out with in days/weeks/months (Natasha, Shuffle, Hell, Alan)
Chloe and Nell both smoke... now, I laugh. 
Wrote some poems...  i will type them up, i swear... eh, i probly wont. I'm too lazy to go get my journal... fuck it.
Realized i say like too much... like, dude, that sucks. (Note to self, stop syaing all three of those words)
Need to figure out a way to stop being so nervous...  i know that what i eat and how much sleep i get affects my reactions, i just need to igure out the right  balance so i stop shaking... or start talking, wait, i cant talk if im shakign cuz i slur my words. I just have to stop shaking. 
I love the vampire chronicles, but it takes me about a week to read each one. Eh.My life is to hectic (Play practice, cutting classes, learn guitar, chrocet a scarf for my mom, read books, do schoolwork,fight wiht my mom, go online, watch tv, hang out wiht my friends after school) I dont get enoughs leep so im always tired which makes it worse, and some daysi dont eat enough which makes me feel weaker and more tired, other wise i eat too much and feel disgusted and fat. 
I am hungry, tired, sick, have ahead ache, a stomch ach, back hurts alot, hands are falling alseep as well was legs form sitting infront of the computer, throat hurts, angry, sad, frushstrated, lonely, unhappy, feel like breaking osmething, hating myself for everything i've done. 
I <i>shouldnt</i> be unhappy. I have many good friends, (Aiyana Xian Margarita Alanna Natasha) I have all the cds, books, makeup, accesories, clothing i want (i have so much it disgusts me smetimes) I am not really fat, just a little ... chunky... chubby..., I'm not ugly, im just average looking, I'm not dumb (yet again im average), I go to a good school with lots of peoplei like to hang out wiht, I get to gon onlien sometimes (why do i really need to go online for more than 45 min a day,serisously),my friends really care about me,so i odnt really even need my parents to care (but they do anyway, in their own ways), i have a cat sally who loves me also. Thats not a bad life. Its a hell o alot btter than some peoples.
Stupid, selfish thingsi want in life:
I want the boys i liek to actually like me back (yea, right, that'll never happen)
I want to live someplace w/o knowing ithat the rent isnt paid, r thati might be thrown out for trying ot live my life
I want to be able to stay out late an dhangout afterschool,even if i dont actually do thati want to have the option.
I  want a new computer, or at leasti want to be able to go on this one more.
I want to be able to sit bymyself and read a book w/o being iterrupted and have to feel guilty for not hanging out wiht my mom
I want to practice on my guitar
I want to balance all of these things out, friends, schoolwork family, and have things be ok
I dont want everythingi  plan on doing and look forward for to be cancled by eveyone other than me.
I dont want to be really happy one day, and have alot fo fun,thenhave to go through amonth of being punish by the whole fucking world for that one day of happiness.
I dont want to get so  sick easily, and i dont want to have such bad nerves and blood pressure, if im not shaking out oif nervousness i can tmove b/c my whole body has fallen asleep.
I want to be able to afford a starbucks drink or something a few days aweek, and i want tohave lunch money every day. If im not going to eat i want it to be my choice.
I do not want to have ot mis school, cut school, or not hang go to play practice b/c someone else sya si have to or threatens me. I do not want  to be forced into a corner.
I want to be able to tell people how i really feel without being afraid... i want people tolike me for who i am.
I dont want to be nervous iahet it it stops me form talking to people that i want to talk to or having a good time. I try so hard, and even if im not really nervous anymore, my body still reacts badly.

If i cant behappy why cant someone put me out of my misery? I'm too weak tofucking kill myself, im always thinking ""Well, what about tommorrw? What if that one thing that you so deperatly want to happen happens then? And you  kill yourself the day before for no reason?"" 
  And now, if people read this,t hey'lljust classify me as one of those ""depressed cutter people who annoy the fuck out of them"". I dont care anymore, let them hateme."

"event","Ok, interesting day. Dad came, i went with him to staples... new notebooks and pens (that i am lending to NO ONE, cept xian, logan, or lucas cuz i steal his all the time), and i got this cool Learn 2 Play Guitar book... its colorful <u>And</u> useful. Yay. Also got guitar picks, tortex .5 and .6, like Damian uses. Walked around myrtle ave wiht my mom, found this small dark craft store... bought some cheap but pretty red&black ribbon, gonna sew it on something eventaully... not sure what yet. Bought some yarn and crochet needles... so now i will have a pink/black/blue scarf. They didnt have any nice blood reds, heh. There is also this huge craft store, but it made me dizzy b/c there was way to much florescent lighting, i cant stand that shit. I can chrochet, which is cool, and i can sew, so maybe i will make something cool... i wanna get some more plain black shit from beacons and sew lace and ribbon on it... the whole thing would end up being less than 10$, ribbon is like 29 cents ayard, and lace is like a dollar or less... i am so becoming a wannabe goth by valentines day (the most depressing lonely awful day of the year, other than past night-before-xmas). Eh, i like pink too much to be goth. whatever, screw stereotypes. :)
I cannot wait until monday afterschool, i am getting <i>Queen of the Damned</i>. I took the last two books, so i will continue and take the rest of them (ive set up a certian atmosphere for perfect reading, and this adds to it... it makes me feel like i actually did something, not just hand over 7 bucks to someone who doesnt deserve... at least a minimal ammount of skill is involved). Those books are perfect perfect perfect. and wonderful. and o-so-everything i love combined into one format. ::sighs:: this is my new love, lol... these books. whatever, they arnt as oblivious as the boys i like. 
Sunday is so soon... thankyoulouis,lestat,armand,marius,claudia.
Havent really practiced on my guitar, tuned it today. Electronic tuners are useful, but tuning as a paininthe ass anyway. Tommorrow i will actually take the amp out of th ebox and turn it on... im just so glad its really mine... its the only thing that really makes me happy, and that i can count on for more than a month."

Went to willaimsburg wiht my mom, found the soundtrack to Crime+punishment in suburbia, used, which ive been looking for for months. I'm past the half-way point in <i>The Vampire Lestat</i> now.  I was suposed to call margarita today... i just didnt feel liketalking to anyone, not my dad (who called twice,  i did notpick up) or anyone else, not evne my mom... she asked me if i was depressed. Typical new year as always... but i shouldnt have expected anything more than that, as i shouldve learne dover the past year, all my expectations were dismally destroyed every time i got my hopes up. But that is my life... and not a bad one at that. 
Tommorrow: Resolutions, Complete Xmas gift list, the good, bad & ugly (it will be amusing to all who ar ein my class currently, or were last year), and of course the ""What i want to get if i ever have money again"" list.

Guitar- may or may not have to sell it, currently i cannot touch it, damn.
Book - Got the second Vampire chronicles book, it was apain in the ass, way to much work for a fucking free book, but i really wanted it, it was worth i think.
Dad - dont think i will talk to him again, or anytime soon. dont love him at all. hopes he dies so i can get insurence and i wont be so poor and homeless anymore.
Apt - need to leave in feb, mickey gave mom a thousand as a gift, so she was ableto pay las tmonths rent, were one month behind, ceiling tile fell on her head a few days ago, the ceiling hole is creeping me out... weird stain on ceiling. paranoid.
New years - havent talked to hell in over a week, hes rthe only person i really know out of all of them, and since i have no idea whats going on, i will probly end up staying at home wiht my mom. and it was hard for me to fight for permission a few weeks ago, and now i know it was for nothing. even if i dont go i still wont have permisiion to do anything big, like staying overnight somewhere, until after we move. really fucking great
Cd player - yet to get anew one for xmas, i wont have any money for anything for the next few months soi have to stick wiht aiyanas old one. it works ok, though, which is good. i needed to remove the jesus sticker due to the fact that 1. ghetto people were harassing me on the subway 2. people kept on askign me abotu it and trying to pull it off so it was already half off anyway. 

I feel like ive been depressing people. So im not gonna say anything anymore about anything, at least not to anyone. Just in my lj. And then it will be on private veiew. thats the easiest way.

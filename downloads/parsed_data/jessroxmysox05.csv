"event","Hey All.
Well, I woke up at 5:30 today and don't have to leave til 6:50 so I thought I'd write in this thing since I haven't written in well...a LOONG time. I watched ""Not Another Teen Movie"" last night and it lasted til about 2:30. It was good tho, don't know how I woke up so early tho ha. As I see it girls wake up about...an hour or 2 or 3 before time to 'get dressed' which in girl lingo is throw on about 5 outfits til they find the *perfect* one, which nobody at school really thinks is perfect. Then do their hair, which also takes a long time. And do 'make-up and accessories' Then you have your guys who roll outta bed, brush the teeth, dont bother brushing the hair cuz its just gunna get messed up neways. Pick up the clothes on the floor that dont smell put um on. Spray on the Axe..if you got axe you got girls on you lol! And then hit the door. Those are reasons why girls take about 2 hours, and guys take about 10 minutes haha. Theres nothing wrong with that girls, cause after those 2 hours, your loookin foiinnnee lol. Well, Court's on so I'm gunna bug her. Peace Out 'DaWg' hahahha

"event","The more they talk about our love, the more they make it obvious, the more they seem so into us. Lol Elena. And no Court we're not going out. Okay, to understand that you must know the story. Me and Elena were singing Brandy..and so Court goes ""OMg! You two are going out?"" ok..might not sound funny but trust me..it was lol. Well today Me,Dan,Evan and Ian are goin to sleepover Connor's house. Haha! And by coincidence Court's going over there too. For all of you who don't know..Connor and Courtney are cousins. But I dont think she knows we're goin so shhh lol. Yesterday was good. We were gunna go to Maryvale to watch Jessica play soccer, but things n plans changed. So Me and Ian went to the mall. And somehow we met up with Dan and Evan there! WHoa! lol. Okay, maybe we were stalking Courtney and Cathy but, they were at the regal and their movie started at 7:30. And it was 6:00. So, we called Shelly and told her our plan. So she drove us to Regal. God, Courtney and Cathy are blonde. We decided to go to the exact same movie as they did at the same time lol. Okay so we bought our tickets and right away we saw them by this dance machine thing. But they didn't go on it..cuz if they did it woulda been funny. So then they went into the theater. They were sitting right in the front row and totally DIDNT see us walk in! Four guys..walking into a theater passing right by their row and they didnt see. So we sat a few rows behind them. There was another girl w/ Court n Cathy but idk who lol. It was hilarious! The movie was okay i guess..but there were a few parts where they just totally screamed lol. And it's not like all the ppl in the theater were screaming..just those three oddballs lol. And at one part they were all squeezing together so they wouldnt be scared, u had to be there lol. So then we left and came back to EastAurora to Evan's house. Court n Cathy still dotn no we followed them, but they will after they read this lol. Well bye

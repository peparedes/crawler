I can get back on im tomorrow thank god.  i only have 6 days until i leave...i cant wait i am finally gettin out of auburn and goin someplace hot!  I just found out where we are goin...i guess my mom and i are goin to Fort Myers and then to West Palm, should be fun.  Right now i am watchin Miss Congeniality, but i might go out for a bikeride cuz i forgot my sneakers so i cant go running.  Nothin else is new..oh except that drama this year is goin to stink and we're deff not ready.  I'm very disappointed in the Yankees right now..they lost today to the Orioles 7-2 ..thats really not cool at all!  They better win tomorrow thats all i have to say.  Well idk what else to say so i guess ill go and play XBox or somethin.  talk to everyone lata..bye!

This is much smaller than the regular version.  It was a graphic design I tried to implement into my portfolio for 2D Design.  Being that I can use various media, mixed, paint, graphic design, photography, &c; I decided to try out the graphic design portion, since I have already done a lot with photography.  And will continue to by the way, but yea.  

I wasn't sure of what I was trying to accomplish by doing this, it was more of a sporadic lets have some fun with a flower type of thing.

My concentration this year is machine vs. nature which is odd for me.  Doing something so abstract and surreal can be hilarious and fun. I hope to explore it a lot.  I am doing a concentration at school right now with the aurora borealis with the reflection in a lake below.  But the reflection is of a city, a skyline, with industry and what will eventually become of that naturally inherent beauty that the landscape posesses.  I also contrasted the texture for it.  I used the texturous rather 3d palette knife for the nature and a thin meticulous brush work for the city.  It is quite contrasting, and I am pleased with it.  

I am also working on a piece that is a fractal interpretation of a shoreline. It is wild.  I am either going to do it tremendously small or tremendously big.  I haven't decided yet.  It would look fabulous big but I'd rather save those for when I do something so amazing that comes from my own thought.  The aurora thing would work well large.  I am thinking of doing a self portrait on one of the huge pieces (2' x 3' and 2' x 2').  They are big.  I would need a lot of pant so you can see I want to be sure.  I don't need to cost more money.  I spend most of my money on my art supplies. I am such a junkie.  I am addicted to it  I love the smell of paint and art supplies and the feel.  To be immersed in art is so orgasmic sounding to me, its crazy.  

Another piece I am working on- or well need input on is an interpretation of one of my nudes for massart, this one

<img src=""http://saturnity.org/images/art/cathythumb1.jpg"">

Except that instead of the bottom portion being natural, I am going to turn it into a robot type of thing with machinery and wires and metal.  It will be interesting. It is working out fine so far, I need to spend a fe more drafts on it though before it gets right completely.  I may have to buy another pad of 18 x 24 paper.  Guh.  I should go after school tomorrow to the art store and get one.


Some of my art is being entered into the Scholastics Competition for my state:

and a serigraph I can't find the picture of. 
If I win anything I will be very happy.  If i get the gold key my art will go to NYC.  That would be exciting, but I would want my art back desperately, I love it so."

"event","On Saturdays for the Fall I am taking a Photography and Figure Drawing Course.  

Here are some of my photographs that I have developed.
The basic focus has been on depth of field and experimenting with the sharpness of the camera.
Appature also comes into play.

I own a Canon A-1 SLR with a 50 mm lens.
It is very sharp


<b>This one was taken on the table top with a greater depth of field with a field exposure of probably around 16</b>
<img src=""http://www.saturnity.org/art/2004_1113Image0023.JPG"">

<b>This was taken of my backyard with another great field exposure of around 16</b>
<img src=""http://www.saturnity.org/art/2004_1113Image0024.JPG"">

<b>This picture was taken with a different perspective.  The foreground is out of focus while the back is in focus. The split of light is natural and not caused by any clashing light sources.  It is a natural occurance that adds enigmatic qualities to the piece.</b>
<img src=""http://www.saturnity.org/art/2004_1113Image0025.JPG"">

<b>Though a great depth of field is also captured in this there is nothing much to say about this photograph.</b>
 <img src=""http://www.saturnity.org/art/2004_1113Image0026.JPG"">

<b>A different perspective on one of the earlier pieces where the depth of field hovers around 2 or less.  The foreground is in focus and the light still contrasts.</b>
<img src=""http://www.saturnity.org/art/2004_1113Image0027.JPG"">

<b>This was taken with another great depth of field though only the tree is truly captured as well as what is in front of it.</b>
<img src=""http://www.saturnity.org/art/2004_1113Image0028.JPG"">

<b>Again with the foreground being in focus and the back being out of focus,this piece emphasizes upon that leg of the stool.</b>
<img src=""http://www.saturnity.org/art/2004_1113Image0029.JPG"">

<b>The warm light gives an unrealistic tone to this piece.  It is a perspective looking up.</b>

"event","Welcome!  


I am also the owner of the journal <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/calimari"">calimari</a>.  I decided that I needed a journal for myself and my art.  Whether anyone reads it I don't really care.  It's just a nice thing to keep I think. 

So I will be describing my art and art excursions and posting pieces and updates with them. 

I will post the pieces I do have up sometime."

"event","Your 3 nights are up. And how much boar's blood do you think I have? NONE? HOLY FUCK, you stupid minions can't get anything right. Fortunately, I expected this, so I got it my self. Do you dumb fucks have any idea how hard it is to peck and hoot a god damn boar to death? 'Course you don't. I will let this go just this once. But god help you if my next demands are not met. I need human corpses. 3 of them. It does not matter how they are aquired, or when they were deceased. You have 5 nights. Don't dissappoint me again."

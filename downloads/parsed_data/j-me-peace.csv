The ONLY thing on, besides Orange County Choppers I have already seen is Pretty Woman.  Im enjoying the silence.  We are here for tennis which is just about as pretentious as you can be.  My day yesterday was reall really long.  I was set for a nice and relaxing day, where I could get my list down.  The boss left me in contact with our breakfast speaker's booking agent. When the boss left for a 2 week vacation, he sent an email to call in emergencies, and the thought was that the speaker was 99% booked. One more phone call and we were set.

HOWEVER... the speaker thinks its more important to do something else so we scrambled to find a date.  We have one, and I dont know, just scrambled.  I am tired now and we are spending the weekend with our dear friends, but nonetheless we are not alone. And they have a 10 year old who we adore, but she is a 10 year old. So television is relegated to sports and kiddie shows, and activites are debated to find the most happy decision.

They have Thai here and I have organic bread and there is coffee galore. 
I have wireless internet in my room.
The hotel toiletries are from BATH AND BODYWORKS.
and we got the room for $66 on Hotels.com

"event","I have writers block. Granted, I could just go on to another task, but that is silly.

I was really cranky this weekend, but dammit, I am not apologizing.
My girl scouts wanted to earn more money, forcibly told to do so by my co-leader who thinks that if we dont have money we cant do anything.  So we all got in the car and went to Glenrock just so HER daugther wouldnt be seen by any cute boys that she knows in Casper.  HELL!
I spent $8 at Save-A-Lot in Casper buying water and treats (my co-leader wanted to know why I didnt wait to buy them in Glenrock) (She doesnt understand small towns) (hella expensive!)
Then we were off to Glenrock where the person who was supposed to know we were coming, and where to put us, didnt. I voted to do the booth outside (it was AWESOME) but my co-leader's daughter wanted to have it inside, soI called my Dad and he brought another table down.  
We started selling at 10. at 10:30 my co-leader's daughter wanted to know when lunch was.
FREAK!
I was in New Hampshire for the last meeting, and we only have meetings every other week. This isnt too handy when you need to meet before something big like a BOOTH SALE. but we didnt have one so no one was thinking about change, lunch, etc.

I bought lunch, and took a girl with me so that we could try and get food everyone would like. I got a sub for me with veggies all over it.  We get back and I tell the girls to wait a minute ill buy chips then we can eat. (Chips, $2.50, subs, $22)
I come out and they have torn into MY sandwich and complain about its contents.
I AM CRABBY!!!! I try not to call them names, and scream, and try to turn it into something funny.

OK. So: In all, we sold 5 cases of cookies, which equals ($30).
I spent more of my personal money on those kids than they earned. Not to mention I gave up MY SATURDAY MORNIG!!!!!
Once they discovered that our 3 hours were up, and that it was time to go my co-leader asked if we should go to Casper to a car sale and try to sell the rest.  I said NO. I was done.

So - here is the deal. 

I AM DONE SELLING COOKIES FOREVER.  NO MORE. IF MY GIRLS WANT MONEY, THEY CAN ASK FOR IT. WHICH IS HIGHLY MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF TIME AND ENERGY. HAD I NOT SPENT THAT MONEY ON TREATS AND FOOD, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN AHEAD BY MY MONEY AS A DONATION INSTEAD OF FOOD.

OK.
Im am so done.

Peace Im out."

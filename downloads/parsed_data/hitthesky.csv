This is a brief one however.

Things in my life are going along at a nice pace I find.
I still haven't got a job.
But I am now resident DJ at Independant night club on Tuesday nights for it's gay night.
And I am hoping that will bloom and continue to be successful as well as hopefully being a shoe in to maybes doing the Newcastle night ""Jellybean"" when it begins back end of February.

This is the poster that <B>Weareclu</B> (Ian) designed for my Tuesday night:

Blooming brilliant that boy.

In news of Me and Ian; we are now your resident DJs in Camp David every Saturday night. Unless one of us can't do it or dies suddenly. I think more of you lot should come and see us. It wouldn't hurt and it'd make me very happy to see people who'd want to dance and not just be trendy shits standing about crossing their arms, staring you down, drinking, moaning and dissing.

Now for my love life.
It isn't bad. For once.
I'm not seeing anybody, haven't really had sex in a while but I'm not unhappy. I kind of like where my love life is right now. It's fairly uncomplicated and thats good because I really believe that I haven't got the time, money or patience to begin anything too serious.
Theres a few nice guys who I have interests in and we'll just have to see what works out."

from clutching and clawing at the floor
holding onto some bitter little life
and my friends seem to have no doubts
about the doom looming above my door
even when I'm kicking back against strife

And it seems my hearts a no mans land no more
it's a heart that knows its destination
and won't always serve the other
and sometimes my mind forgets the core
of why my heart took its time in procrastination
why it's no longer looking for cover"

I dont get messages passed to me at home because my brothers an ignorant cunt and my mum is forgetful unless its Benji because shes the only one who she remembers.

I just feel a tiny bit out of the loop lately and therefore am feeling incredibly sorry for myself.

Me & somebody had a bit of row/talk last night. Things are a bit clearer between us now. And thats all good. But I have my worries about how long it will be before they begin to forget all we talked about and go back to their old ways.

Which can be found here:

http://blog.myspace.com/hittheground

If you cant be bothered to go there and read everything thats gone on (if you have already read all of these, feel free to ignore this part) here are some choice cuts:-

<B><u>Saturday, May 20, 2006</U></B> - ""I'm not sure how bad it is, I havent really given myself time to let it all sink in......My parents want to know what I want to do for a living, my mum hassled me for to tell her my dreams the other day and when I told her I'd love to open a record store she told me ""well we'd all love to do that...!""
I think I'm a little sick and tired of being put down by the people who supposedly want the best for me, but would rather I did a fucking shitty 9-5 call centre job where I would be manic-depressive with no hope of a future anywhere after leaving them.......I could do and be so much.
But I just feel like I dont have the confidence anymore.
I feel like I'm just counting the days.

I think it's about time I faced some problems.""

<B><U>Saturday, May 27, 2006</B></U> - ""These past couple of days my paranoia has increased somewhat. I think it's safe to assume that I dont like myself right now and I'm kind of shying away from things that I shouldnt be......thanks for the text......I may try to find a boy. But I've all but given up on them now anyways.""

<B><U>Wednesday, June 07, 2006</B></U> - ""I really wish I'd been born an only child......I'd also like to know where his self respect is when he's taken the emergency money and spent the fucker up his nose......The past 2 weeks or so have been a whirlwind so it's canny hard to piece together where I've been and when, so unfortunately I can't give a proper update (though some things are best left under the carpet, eh?)......What a sad state of affairs.""

<B><I>Wednesday, June 21, 2006</B></I> - ""Yeah, so lifes gonna get interesting from here on in, not a lot going on, but foundations are being set for it.""




And thats about it.

So lets see.

I've gotten a job in the diner. Woohoo! Should be good fun once I've actually gotten used to doing everything.

My mobile phone is broken. At least until I can call O2 it is.

Foundations have crumbled and things are still under the carpet.
A lesson for myself and another person to be learned: if your trying to dig for some kind of truth, all your going to get is dirty. Better to wait it out or just not know. There's less paranoia that way.

Life is still a whirlwind.

Saturday was a bit of an up and down day. First day at the diner. Went well, made lots of milkshakes and tried my best that I could on a busy saturday afternoon. After that me & Nadine mooched to electrik sheep (which is like a second away from the diner). I bought a new belt and then we went for a wander, seen Nathan in Reiss and spoke to him about the party and how us Shields folk are ""radgy"" I was banned from hitting anybody at the party. Haha.
Then it was off to Intermezzo to meet Dave. But first we bumped into Johnny and spoke to him for a little bit. Dave gave me free apple juice and made Nadine a coffee and then I went home to get changed. It was then back to the diner for alcoholic milkshakes with Jax & Chris:
Jax - ""DONT INTERUPT HIM! HE DOESNT LIKE IT WHEN YOU DO IT TO HIM!""
Chris - ""It's true, the only person who I like interupting me is myself when I go off on a tangent!""
Lovelovelove those 2 kids when they get together.

Nathans party on the evening was great fun. Though I remember very little so I shall try my best to fill the gaps as best as possible. Helped Ian and Hayley to DJ (when I say helped, I basically just told Hayley what she should play next due to the fact that she didnt have any ideas for what she could play that'd go down well). Nathan was well drunk and very nice to all his guests and made a good host (certainly better than me at mine, since I hid in the bloody DJ booth all evening). After his party it was off to the cosmic ballroom with Ian, James, his friend Wayne and Emma. We were guestlist. Thankfully. People pay to get in there? I can understand it if they just want to stay downstairs. But seriously, upstairs is just a joke. It's a school disco. Playing all of the ""old school."" I could've gone to Dusk in shields and paid less and danced to the same crap. But yeah, downstairs was mint.
Funniest (and strangest) quote of the night - ""he said if i score with you he'll kill me""

I'm mentioning no names. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

By about 2am I'd fallen into a shitty mood. And I left not too long after Ian left. Me & James had a bit chat and he offered me a place on his sofa bed.

Woke up the next day feeling a bit worse for wear and feeling like I wanted to give up drinking, that, however would be a stupid statement to make as I know I would never keep to it.

James' mate gave me a lift home in his very nice car. I officially want a smart car.

I feel very sad today.

""...and no matter what you put me through, I'll still believe in love and I say 'I love your love action'""

But I have The Human League (as well as a thousand other artists in my iTunes) to make the day all better. Or at least a little bit better.

So what am I doing today? Good question.
Trying to get my phone fixed so I can resume some semblence of contact with the outside world.

Then I'm going to tidy my room.
Throwing out all the auld shite that I no longer want.

I have the Pipettes album.
Oooooooo!

""We are the Pipettes, we're the prettiest girls you've met.""

I agree, they're damn fine, however, I've not met them."

"event","Well these past few days have a been a fucking riot.

I shall tell all of that in my own time though (if i feel like it).

Anyways!
Last night I went to see Slither. What a fucking class film, honestly, it was fucking class, total throwback to cheesey 70s and 80s horror flicks. Plus its got zombie deers. Whats there not to love?!

My bank are fucking crap. My debit card has expired, so I cant get to my dole money which should be in my account today or tomorrow until next Thursday or Friday because I should've received my new card on the 25th of April, which, surprise surprise, hasnt fucking arrived.
So I've had to report that as lost & order a new one, which i have to pick up from the bank itself.

Not impressed at all.

Plus I know for a fucking fact that sods law will mean that the ""lost"" card will turn up in the post tomorrow.

So now, I can't pay off my debts & pay people money back that I owe them (only my mum thus far).

I really am so so so so so enraged.

I swear as soon as my overdraft is paid off with Llyods TSB I'm moving to Halifax completely. They seem to know how to actually do their jobs.

In other news, I aint all too impressed by the new Futureheads effort. I miss the shouty mackemness of the first album.
""Back To The Sea"" is the standout track though, and ""Skip To The End"" is grand too.

The new Red Hot Chili Peppers album from what I've heard so far (7 tracks from disc one) is just absolutely amazing and is going to be my soundtrack to the summer I think. Most people doing a double album kills the career (yes, Foo Fighters, I'm talking to you) but the Chili's seem to have done great so far. Obviously I'll be able to say more when I've heard the second disc.

Thus far though, exceptional.

People should listen to a band called Rinocerose too. They're a bit Daft Punk, a bit Goldfrapp and a bit Le Tigre."

I got an H awarded by Gavin

Hot Chip: Are currently my favourite music group. Theres just something about them thats always made me sit up and go ""shit, if I were in a band, this is the kind of thing I'd want to be doing! dance music for the indie kids!"" It is course not meant to be. But Hot Chip will be that band that always holds a very particular place in my heart. I mean in the last 3 months since hearing I've them, I've cumilated 57 tracks in total by them (including remixes) and I never usually go this indepth with any musical artist regardless of how much I love them.

Horn (The): Is fucking dangerous in or out of a relationship. It's absolutely 100% true. If you wake up with the horn and dont get rid of it, your doomed to spend the rest of the day looking around & thinking up possible ways & means of getting any kind of sex with somebody. Whether it be with a boyfriend a simple one off with some stranger. Of course, the one offs only usually happen in the extreme cases unless your a complete slapper.

Hormones: Mine didnt kick in until I was about 17. I really dont think so anyways. I was very slow on the uptake on everything to do with my body & my sex life. My voice broke early on when I was 13 and on a school trip to Germany. Though nobody believed me because Adam Thompson laughed about it & told everyone it was lies. This led to me & him pretty much hating one another until we never had to see one another again. His voice still hasnt broken. It was jealousy all along.

Hair: is nice. Most people have hair. I'm losing mine already. I have what my mum refers to as the Donaldson (her surname, family trait) ""M"" which basically means that a M shape is forming in my hair line. Personally, I couldnt care. I quite suit being bald anyways so I cant really wait.

Hallways: I love hallways. That sounds weird. But it's hallways of peoples houses that you've not been to yet. And you can smell that house smell. How everything is different. It's stupid. But always makes me smile.

Heaven: erm....is a place on earth? Heavens Above. Its in Newcastle. Lots of gay boys there.

Hell: Is the Earth itself to be fair. No wonder the Aliens dont want to invade our planet, it's fucked.

Hotels: Are evil. Dylan Moran is correct in saying that hotel rooms are the only rooms in existance where the first thing you do when you walk into them is think ""what can I steal in here?""

Helen: Is the name of my only cousin on my dads side. Out of me & Andrew I'm her favourite cousin because I dont ""talk to her like a kid"" and because I'm funny. Whereas Andrew is always moody apparently.

Happiness: Comes along only every once in a while. It's a state of mind really. if you think happily, you will be happy. However, it isnt always the case most of the time."

"event","i havent cried in weeks
i forgot how good it can actually feel

sometimes i just want to be alone in a field
it would be pouring with snow
and soon enough the whole field would be white
the moon would be out in full force
as cute as a button
the field would be mine
to do whatever i want
i would run and jump around
and think about my life
and where i went right
and where i went wrong
i would think about my friends
about how much i love them
and how i hate having to see them go away
if it wasnt so cold i'd probably be crying
just a few tears coming down my face
but I hold back because I dont want them to freeze to my face
eventually i would lie down
i'd shut my eyes
and i'd just float away
i wouldnt know where
i wouldnt want to know
because when I feel sad
or alone
or beaten
or the shittest I can feel
I always have my field
right out there in the middle of nowhereness
my own little winter paradise"

"event","well this weekend has been a really rather interesting one.

I was off work Thursday & Friday due to a really fucking bad back.

Thursday I did shite all. Left Ians & went home then off to Lukes house for some playing on games. Then my gran came over, she talked rubbish (like grans do) for a bit & then went home. I then went to bed. Pretty early in the hope an early night would set me right.

Friday came & I still felt sick as fuck so I rang in again. Sat watching films & stuff in the house. The evening came & Ian came around, I got showered & we went to Erins. Then we went to Camp David (where Erin decided she wanted to marry Andrew) then to Jukebox & danced. Kyle wasnt there as he was ill with flu but massive fun was had. Ian left to go to powerhouse (gayboy) and get G. He then returned later (hurrah!) and ran into his own drama later, which I wont mention here.

Katie had a fight with some bint cos she said Kasabian were shit. Was really scary to see the lass dragged out of the club by her neck though. Katie said she was sticking an ASBO on herself. Myself, Erin, Charlotte, Richard & Katie danced lots. Bryan introduced himself to me & told me I'd better add him to myspace. And since he's a big fella & pretty cool, I said yes. He loves RightSaidFred according to Kyle & knows all the words to many of their songs.

Saturday came quickly and I went to work, on the way in I seen Kathryn who I sent shopping for me (cheers lover). At work I dossed about, did very little & spoke loads to Ally and bought her a cadburys creme egg. Then to Brighton Beach. Which I didnt really enjoy. It was one of the few nights where nothing felt right, everything felt very detatched. Though it could have been that me & Kyle had far too much southern comfort at mine before going out & drinking vodka on the train with Erin & Charli. At the beach we saw Scotty (who later had his nose broken, nice), Dave Randle, Keir, Nic, Ewan, Jax, Nadine and the future ""best mother in the world ever"" - according to Erin (and jumper purchaser); Kathryn. Chrissy was also there. I laughed a bit at Nadine doing a Tina Turner walk. Jax apparently did a horse impression, but I sadly missed it. Ally & Pippa of course we're present, Pippa was fucking mashed, well done you plonk =D and Ally was too & broke her camera silly bint haha.

I left at about 1.30 and went to Camp David to get Ian. Sat in there for about an hour, got food from Spice (and accosted by some fucking arsepiece woman who kept lifting my bag up, making the queer she was with to say ""just leave him darlink, put him down, come on now"" I actually wanted to fucking tear them to shreds with some quick quips, but couldnt be fucked). Went back to Ians, didnt go straight to bed...then woke up on sunday & went shopping. Bought some dvds (the machinist, saw, akira and heat) and a ps2 with Shadow of Collosus & Black. Marvellous.

All in all, pretty cool.

Today i bought an awful shirt (which i love), some stripey socks, Spiderman underpants, a plain black tee & a plain white tee, and a green & white belt. It made me feel a bit better since today I found out I've lost my job. My last shift is saturday. Oh joy. Oh bliss.

"event","was canny good.

Friday night, me, Rachael, Matt and my boss Kelly all sat in Kellys and ate chinese food and listened to music and talked about books and films and culture and stereotypes and charvas and Matts forthcoming novel (which involves somebody scoring a goal against Manchester Utd using their fully erect cock) and Patrick Wolf and strange female singers and emo discos where all the patrons would be dancing to really sad disco songs and Matt was very drunk. It was funny.

I went home & attempted to fix my pc (which is now fixed).

Saturday I got up & went to work, laughed lots with the lovely Alice and the Alex. It was a fun day. Passed quickly. Rachael was pleased that Ben wasnt in as she doesnt like him ""he's just fucking stuck up & thinks he knows better than everyone else"" wanted to say that people in glass houses perhaps shouldnt throw stones but I didnt feel like causing bother on a saturday.

On the way home Kyle text me to ask if I was going to Bulletproof. So I rang Erin.

And we got wrecked in mine and went and danced.
And my my my, what a night. It was just absolutely fucking brilliant.
Bulletproof was fucking mint. Specially right at the end of the night when we got to spend the last 50 minutes or so spazzing out to LCD Soundsystem, Chicks on Speed, The Rapture, Peaches, Ladytron and other delights.

We also heard ""I Feel Just Like A Child"" which made me veryveryvery happy.
After upstairs finished we went & danced downstairs for ten minutes with Hollie.
And then went for chips with her & Terrie.

Then me & Erin stood talking to Scotty and Bri for ages before we got a taxi home.
Bri makes the laser sights for bombs to find the targets
Scott - ""fuck off man, you kill people for a living""
Bri - ""Yeah i know, I'd do something else but the money isnt that bad""

It made me laugh at least until I realised the reality of his job. Oops.

What else?

Oh yes, me & Erin decided that the next fancy dress party we go to, we are going to be Peaches & Iggy Pop.

Either them or Howard Moon & Vince Noir.
Just so she wouldnt need to actually dress up.
And I'd only need a curly wig and a rubbish moustasche (which i can grow, thank you hormones).

Sunday I got up and went to meet Ian after having my Sunday lunch. It was nice. The dinner I mean.
Me, Ian, his friend Laura and her boyfriend Paul went to see the Newcastle Vipers play against some team from somewhere who were nicknamed the Panthers. It was an Ice Hockey match, it was fun, I loved it, really got into it.

I'm not sure who won however as we left early to go see Munich. Which I'm still not sure what to make of.

It was brilliantly shot & realised, very very intense, with some amazing moments. But I felt at times like I just shouldnt have been watching it. But I suppose that was the point.

It also cemented for me that Daniel Craig may actually be good as James Bond. The right level of charming and intense. Munich seemed like a practice run.

I say to go see Munich and make up your own minds about it, be warned though, its graphic and may possibly fuck with your mind.

Today I worked.

It was ok.

This is life so far this year.

It's canny good."

"event","i havent updated in well over a week.

so whats been going on?

well im back with Ian. After careful consideration & some serious thinking about his apology and my hypocrisy, I decided to give it all another go, actually being able to talk to Pipp again as a friend & not just as someone who'd kissed someone I liked helped this decision too, cos you cant build a relationship around that unless you get over it or just cut that person off completely, and I'm not that kind of guy, plus him & Ian both expressed that their kiss was just a big stupid mistake.

Forgive & forget, move on, live life. I'm pretty happy with where we seem to be headed so it's all good. And he actually wanted to meet my friends & likes them. And those who've met him, like him too. So its good. I also like his friends too of course. Paris cracks me up, Christine is probably very likely mad, Murphy still looks like Kev from Shameless to me but he's cool, and Darren is...just Darren.

Work has been work. I've had 2 sick days in the space of a week. One last friday & then today because of stupid antics at the Cooperage & not being fully fighting fit (as I was off on friday through having a virus & was ill until about Sunday).

Recently I received an email from James. If I make it sound like he's a five star bastard to you all then I apologise. I also apologise if I seemed to have spread any lies or fiction about him. He's very annoyed that I have betrayed his friendship & etc. Frankly, I couldnt give a fuck anymore.

My side of things? If I made him sound like a five star bastard, it's probably because thats how I felt he's treat me lately.

Not sure what he gives a fuck for? He's very unlikely to meet you.

I also forgot that he mentioned for me not to write about him again here, but fuck that, its my journal for a reason, I'll write about whoever I want, whenever I want. Just as he would, if he had one.

I've kept the email, for future reference for whenever I want to give a fuck about something important in my life.

<b>In other news:</b>

I finally finished watching the 4th series of 24. Its quite ace.
As of now, I have no desire to watch the new series of The OC (at least until I've seen the rest of series 2)
CSI season 4 is absolutely some of the most intense drama I've seen & they havent even really gotten into the character underlines, just merely touched upon them. It's pretty excellent.

Last night, as I said, i went to the cooperage for Nadines birthday. I think she enjoyed her night. She did a few impressions of Noodle from the Gorillaz, we watched Daves band play, and me & Erin danced lots. Lyz sadly had to go home early to wait for her girlfriend to come in ;-) just joking Lyz, you knows I loves you. You knows it. I also seen Cull & Wally as well which was canny mint. Wally was FUCKED however and by the end of the night didnt know who I was anymore. Cull disappeared. We also seen Scotty (I ruined 2 songs for him by changing the lyrics), Ashleigh Peters (random), Simon (who was quite mortal) and Chris (who, as ever, was talkative & left early...hmm).

So this was a brief look at whats going on in my life at the present moment.

Right now I'm off to Camp David as Ian is managing the bar tonight then I'm staying at his & he has a surprise for me apparently sometime tomorrow.

I'm praying that he's won the lottery & he's going to fly me away.





I can bloody dream alright!"

does that say anything?

so last night after work me & kelly went for dinner at nandos, was nice
we discussed loads of stuff
i also told her i was gay
then we went to see king kong
which is FUCKING AMAZING
by far one of the most brilliant films ive ever seen
some of the camera work did make my head ache (slow mo shot overkill)
and some characters did just die in the most bizarre unexpected not to mention unexplained ways
but overall it was absolutely super to see peter jacksons vision of king kong put on the screen
its worth going to see for the last hour and a half
once it starts, it really doesnt let up
it just becomes this amazing ride
fantastic, just fantastic

brighton beach was next on the agenda after saying goodbye to Kelly
i said hello to simon and sarah
then erin and karli
kate, kathryn & lauren
tish
jackie
and then to the bar for a couple of doubles
then to brighton beach where inside we found the wonderful ally bee & pipparoo
everyone looked lovely
and it was fantastic to see everyone and have a bit dance and that
really did have one of the best nights ever
text james to say that i had fun
he did too
ride the wave
thats how im going to operate

spent all day in bed today
i do believe that my mam and dad are going to get divorced
they were argueing this morning about things
and my dad said that either me or my brother (i didnt hear which of us) should pack our stuff & get out
christmas and new year will again be fun
play happy families
pretend that its all alright
nothing to worry about

5 minutes ago the police just called
my brother was assaulted the other day apparently
im so pleased he choose to tell us
anyone who knows me will know i hate my brother at the best of times
but i do love him, he's my brother dont you know?
and i'd hate to think he's in way over his head
though he probably is

life is a strange beast

i share it all with you, powder blue"

"event","i raged and pissed in your drink
gave up on feeling sick
and so i got over myself
sometimes i feel im nothing
just a sorry joke
then i have to laugh
i think its they who say that if you laugh
the whole world laughs with you
but if you cry
you cry alone
introductions are hard for me
but goodbyes always seem worse
this might be the last time
or even the only time
just a sorry joke this time
smiling feels right
laugh and you can slowly have a room crying
cry and you have it all for yourself
a tiny white light in a broad black life
put the money in the meter
lets see how much time we get
its them that tell us what to do
but we already know ourselves
or we should by now
you laugh and ill laugh along
you cry and i dont know what to do
its the human nature of things
just to run away
to leave it all alone
pulling out the spelk
doesnt make the pain stop
it just keeps bleeding
until its a scab and a scar
laugh
or cry about it"

"event","<P>well everything is going quite nicely in my life i do feel.</P>
<P>im very low on the drama side of my life, nothing much happening and im so incredibly pleased that I'm getting this time to myself right now. Just working and having a laugh &amp; being able to just fucking relax when i come home is fantastic.</P>
<P>ive been debating when i should feel ready to date again. right now im just not sure. like i say, im just not short on offers and i think this may be what i dont want, i may just not want so many people saying ""why dont we go for a drink?"" or ""hey, lets get together!"" or even ""lets get back together!"" i think i just want my peace &amp; quiet right now to ride out the christmas and new year completely bloke free.</P>
<P>at the present moment there are probably only about 4 guys who've asked me out who i'd say yes to.</P>
<P>four is a lot actually thinking about it.</P>
<P>fucking hell, i hate people, whats the point in it all?</P>
<P>relationships are just overrated, people get together just to break up and hurt each other eventually.<BR>why couldnt we just be a bunch of fucking robots who just have sex?<BR>i know some of us may be already, but why not all of us?</P>
<P>this past weekend 2 couples who i absolutely adore as couples, are no longer couples.</P>
<P>it all just really fucking sucks.</P>
<P>down with love.</P>
<P>i dont care if only live once, i just think its such a stupid thing to chase, if it happens then it does.</P>
<P>I'm going to see King Kong on Saturday with my boss Kelly, how fun, shes cool, everyone thinks its a date, hope she doesnt too otherwise she'll be in for a huge big shock haha.</P>
<P>I want a new tattoo.<BR>but what? what? what?<BR>jax your good at thinking up things like this that relate to peoples personalities &amp; stuff.<BR>So far I've been told i should get rick astleys lyrics to ""never gonna give you up"" somewhere<BR>or ""frankie says...""<BR>which i would actually get cos i LOVE frankie goes to hollywood.</P>
<P>alex had a frankie says relax tshirt when he came into work to annoy us today, man i love that boy. he's fucking class.<BR>i think/hope that ben is gay, but i doubt it, hes just very cute, not in a ""i want to sex him"" way, just would love to give him a cuddle and go ""aawww...""</P>

We were rather pissed and danced to lots of chemical brothers and prodigy and doves and erm...i dont remember anything else. I did notice there was no maximo played though, but mainly due to Erin going ""NO MAXIMO!!!!""<BR><BR>I spoke to Lyz about a few things that I'm sure were important to how I feel in my life right now, however, being drunk, i cant remember what they were.<BR><BR>Friday I went into work and was surprised not to have a hangover.<BR><BR>Saturday I went into work on the morning, had lunch with Ally Bee &amp; Luke and then came home. I also met Alex and his fit mate Dave came into the shop to speak to him. Realised it was the same fit lad who I wanted to have sex with outside of Digital when I was doing traffic for the lady Sovereign gig, the ""i'll fill you up"" boy one. Very handsome chap, sadly he's got a girlfriend. I ordered some postcards for him, but doubt they'll be avaliable for his girlfriends christmas pressie. Alex is mad. Love him, he's just fucking mental.<BR><BR>Saturday night me &amp; Erin went to Bulletproof. We went to the gay scene first though to touch many boys, which as usual, didnt happen. I got heavily drunk on a half bottle of vodka before leaving mine. Had more vodka at Erins, had many shots in Baron. Keir &amp; Jax met us in Baron, we had more shots and then went to meet Kayla &amp; Scotty. Jax &amp; Keir went to meet Nadine and Dave Randle (and his beautiful hair). We all met up inside and we asked Kyle for many songs, we danced to many songs and then we went back to Nadines house for CHAPAGNE! and wine. We also watched Napoleon Dynamite, which was funny, but I fell asleep during it. I just remember seeing the bike scene and then just falling asleep. Steven also texted me to tell me he still liked me &amp; doesnt know what to do about it. Nor do I really.<BR><BR>We've been sleeping together again lately but its always only just been about the sex for me and I thought thats what it was about for him too. I made a conscious decision to avoid any sort of advances from him in the next few weeks. I really cant let myself keep going back to a place where I'll wind up hurt, or hurting us both. I'd rather just wait for him to move on and just be mates. He's obviously depressed. He's putting on such a brave face for people &amp; I'd love to be there for him, but I cant risk opening up old wounds. I think he thinks I'm probably avoiding him, and in some aspects I am in order to protect myself really.<BR><BR>Generally my love life seems ok, I've been asked out on a few dates here &amp; there by people who I've known for some time and am quite flattered that they'd want to date me. Truth is I'm just not feeling really ready or in the mood for it all just yet I dont think. Still a little down in the dumps over James, but I think I'm throwing Christmas stress into the same bowl there too. And thoughts about a particular guy who I've liked for absolutely ever, but I'll never ever have and cant quite shake out of my mind. These things happen I suppose. All things change&nbsp;in good time I guess.<BR><BR>I'm really quite enjoying work, its not exactly the most entertaining of jobs, if anything its really quite dull and repetitive and can be extremely harsh on your concentration levels at time. Luke is already thinking of quitting because he thinks everyone there is quite condescending and patronising. Which I do understand but the way I see it, I've worked for Northern Rock for 2 years with a bunch of patronising and condesending bastards who were also racist, homophobic, bigamists and just general arseholes. Then I've worked for Double L Marketing who were patronising and condescending heavy drug users and sex fiends.<BR>Blackwells in retrospect is like fucking heaven. The job is quite simple to pick up &amp; I've already been praised for being able to remember how to do most things. The only thing I've had difficulty with is remembering how to do customer orders properly, but apparently I'm getting that really quickly too. A monkey could do it really. <BR><BR>I have been feeling ill recently, think I've got that bug, my immune system is good though &amp; thus I've only suffered dizzy spells and feeling sick yesterday &amp; today and so I will hopefully be back in work tomorrow. I got sent home at 4.30 on Tuesday &amp; travelled into work this morning but got off at Heworth &amp; called in as I just couldnt have faced it.<BR><BR>I also saw my colleague Fritha going to University and accidently told her I was gay, she said she had an idea i might be but then she didnt think too much about it cos she has many straight friends who are camper than christmas. I didnt mean to tell her, it just sort of slipped out as it does, but it matters so little. Bizarrely she also knows a lad called Stig, but discovered they are two different Stigs, but both of these Stigs have actually met before.<BR><BR>Bizarre.<BR><BR>So anyways, she, apart from Ally Bee, is the first person I've told, but probably not the last to assume I am gay. Pretty certain Kelly knows. I've decided to tell most people at the Christmas party thing. That way I'm telling people on a social level and not a work level. I think this'll be better cos they wont think I'm trying to look like a victim of my own sexuality.<BR><BR>Life at home isnt too bad. My mam still thinks I should find a better paid job. But thats just cos shes eternally unhappy with whatever i do. I could be a movie star making millions of pounds and she'd still be like ""dont you think you should go and get a desk job somewhere?""<BR><BR>I'd really love to move into my own flat hopefully by the summer. Paulsen will be looking for a place and so will Nadine, I'm thinking maybes the three of us should get some place. But dunno if it'd work out depending on where we all want to live. Nadine wants to be in Newcastle, I'd like Newcastle too &amp; Paulsen would like to be in Sunderland (as he thinks he's going to go to Uni there). Paulsens girlfriend Zoe would also prefer for Dave to be in Shields. So its all a bit mad &amp; confusing.<BR><BR>So anybody else thinking of moving out around that time can just let me know please.<BR><BR>Actually, I thought this week was a bit crap but it hasnt been too bad. A small arguement with Rachel at work over how long I had taken on my break and generally feeling really sick.<BR><BR>I'm starting to get a tiny bit excited for Christmas. Really looking forward to everybody coming home. The days when everyone returns to their respective colleges cant come slowly enough.<BR><BR>Everyone should have Roisin Murphys new album, its amazing. Not so amazing is the new Strokes effort. More on that tomorrow night though.<BR><BR>Bedtime for me now. I think I may just lie in bed until Nathan Barley starts. Last night was mint.<BR><BR>""I'm gonna be up for at least 5 days, so if you want me......you know where I am!""<BR><BR></lj-cut><BR><BR>Heres the lyrics to ""Ruby Blue"" for you all.<BR><BR><lj-cut text=""You'd Better Stop And Try To Think""><BR>You'd better stop <BR>And try to think <BR>Look what you're doing <BR>Oh, Ruby </P>

<P>9) Do you live in a city with a good sports team?<BR>Hahahaha, near Newcastle. So we have the football &amp; rugby teams. Though I could say Sunderland, but if I did I think my dad would hurt me.</P>

<P>15) Would you kill george w. bush yourself if you were guarenteed to get away with it?<BR>Probably. Either kill him or put a gun to his head &amp; call him a very nasty man &amp; that he should take a good look at himself.</P>
<P>16) Should guys wear pink?<BR>I think so, as long as its not got too much going on in the shirt. Pale baby pink is also the colour of choice. Anything heavier is just ugly.</P>

"event","Update:

So far this week I have enjoyed working at blackwells.

Today was a bit of a chaotic day as the metros broke & i had to get a bus from gateshead & thus didnt get to work until 9.10 but Kelly knew the metros were broken so she said it was ok. I was really worn out.

I must have dropped a million things today. My mind just didnt feel right.

Think I was perhaps nervous since I was meant to see james tonight. But he's ""busy"" which means he's either working, going the pub, or going on a date. If its the latter it totally negates what i wanted to see him for. I was supposed to pick up my hat & drop off his jumper. He said a flatmate would be in if i wanted to trade so i just said he could get in touch when he has the 5 minutes it would take to do it. Its me that'd be coming an hour and 20 minutes each way out of my time. Not him.

I just want to get my hat & tell him I miss him & see how he feels.

I'm so bummed about it that I even told my mum about it, who couldnt give me any advice but told me to be careful, which was a shock cos compassion from my mother is so few & far inbetween nothing that its just not funny.

On a lighter note last night me & Luke went to see Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire which is just simply brilliant.

I wish our christmas could be like the ones they have in Hogwarts, Christmas just doesnt feel magical to me anymore. 
I'm hoping when I'm doing my own it will do though.
Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort.....now at first I just wasnt so sure. He was born & he spoke & he sounded a bit too weedy to really BE ""He Who Shall Not Be Named"" but as ""You Know Who"" got more & more 'alive' and more & more aware of the fact he had his full powers back he began to get extremely playful & nasty & it was quite shocking to see him just throwing Harry around like a doll. And when taunting him he was just evil. Mocking him. He really did encapsulate that side of Voldemort. He truly gave life to Rowlings words in my opinion. It just sucks so much that he was only in it for no longer than 20 minutes. David Tennant is somebody who I've never found sexy or attractive at all until I seen him dressed up as Doctor Who. As Barty Crouch Jnr. He's just mint. And beautiful.
The kids are really coming along. Daniel Radcliffe still seems to have 2 facial expressions but still pulls off brilliant moments as the troubled teenager who has no idea whats in store for him next in the/his life/book/movie. On a side note, I felt Emma Watson really hammed it up this time around, but I guess thats what her character does in the book too, she is worried for Harry, though the scene with Ron at the Yule Ball was spot on. Ron is fantasic, Rupert Grint has such a range to his acting. I hope he gets lots of work after the potter train has ended. i enjoy watching him act.

Krum & Diggory are quite fit, Diggory was a little too cute looking for my liking, but the boy who plays him really is excellent & will always be remembered for giving Harry Potter fans the first full view of the effects of an ""Aveda Kedavra"" which, by the way, is awful to watch.

""Get rid of the spare."" indeed.

What else? Michael Gambon really should have been Dumbledore all along, I know people say McKellen, but seriously Dumbledore is cracked & Gambon gets this just right. When him & Voldy face up at the end of Phoenix its going to be something really rather special. Not to mention his swan song in book 6 with Snape.

Brendan Gleeson is exactly how I envisioned Moody, but I do wish they hadnt gave the game away so early.

Maggie Smith doesnt get nearly enough time as McGonagall. I really hope they use her more in Phoenix, especially since she & Hagrid have that class scene with Umbridge during the OWLS exams.

The tasks. Task 3 was rubbish. It should have had the monsters in it, not just plants & posessed Krum. I know that with the monsters they'd have never finished the film on time like, but still......MONSTERS HARRY POTTER PEOPLE!!! WHERE WERE OUR SPHINXES!!!!

Alan Rickman is used JUST enough in the film, some really cool scenes just giving such a slow burn to his character.

As usual there are the familar faces, all but Mrs.Weasley who was quite missed. The twins again show that they actually are the best kid actors in the movie besides Emma & Rupert Grint. Ginny gets some excellent lines too.

All in all, its absolutely class.

And who doesnt enjoy a movie that Jason Isaacs is in. Even if it is only for about 6 lines. He was what kept me watching the godawful ""Soldier""

The man is a genius."

"event","So today was my first day at Blackwells.
All went really really well.
I highly enjoyed it.
There were a few of us just starting today.
A blonde girls whos name I think was Gemma but I dont recall cos she worked on the other side of the shop.
Myself.
And a guy called Luke who actually has quite possibly the most amazing green eyes ever. ever. ever.

Is that ""what did you get up to all day?"" i hear you shout?
Well not a lot really, I got used to the systems all over again.
Served some customers.
Sorted some stock out.
And did book returns (which consisted of taking price stickers off the back of massive biology books, which was rather dull, but i sang songs in my head & named one of the skeleton dummys, which kept the pace)

Kelly said she couldnt fathom how I was a bit more serious, but in my defence, i dont want to be really serious & then just fly off the handle randomly, I'd rather get people used to the random side of me now. Plus I was excited, I havent worked since January, its all brand new and things were shiny and fun.

Shiny, fun.

Other than that, nothing else exciting happened today other than that I got the same miserable bus driver to & from work. And I swear he drink drives. He actually has NO control of the bus at most times. He stopped at every red light far too late & nearly killed pedestrians a few times I'm sure. He actually is fucking miserable.

I had a nice lunch & wanted to buy many things from the shops, but I had no money so I couldnt.

I really do love the go! team."

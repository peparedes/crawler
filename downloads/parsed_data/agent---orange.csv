remember Nautilus? who knew what we were in for. ""college?? that's so far away"" we used to think.
in a world where we used to be scared of high school!

the school i want is emerson college in boston.
i have my heart set on it. boston is absolutely gorgeous; i think it's the town for me. of course i'm a little worried that white people will be too much for me, but.. no. on the other hand, i can handle whities.

i'm also applying to a couple others but really, all i want is emerson.
(couple others =     
    * Boston U
    * Columbia
    * Cornell
    * Emerson
    * FIU
    * FSU
    * Syracuse
    * UF)

the most important ones on that list are, emerson, fsu and uf, and fiu for safety.. maybe cornell at the top, too?
i also should start looking into FAFSA and Sallie Mae loans and all that.. 
never hurts to be prepared.. i'm mad nervous that i'll run out of time"

I have decided I'd stop looking for a job till I turned 18.. 
it'll just be easier then. I think I have a great chance at South Beach Office Depot; the guy I met there was such a sweetheart about it and told me to come down as soon as I turned.

I'm finally learning to drive, stick shift, of course.
My mom got a new car yesterday and I would have had no qualms about taking that thing in the street, especialy with the way I've been able to drive manual, automatic is child's play. And I've learned in less than a week!

I've lost weight. Just since finals, I think I've lost 4lbs, which I know must sound like nothing to everyone else but, on a smaller figure, I even notice when I've lost a single pound, so you can imagine.

I'd like to thank poverty, anger and fatigue."

not without reason, of course. 
i'm perfectly fine and then something happens that just drives me up a wall and very little can placate me. 

the most interesting thing is what that type of anger does to me physically; the most unnatural wave of anxiety rushes over my body and i am so far out of my head it's unbearable. 

i'm uncomfortable thinking about what or who's got me so goddamned angry but i can't help it..

So, the story is that a Honduras ""artist"" by the name of Guillermo Vargas Habacuc took a stray dog off the street, tied it to a rope in an <a href=""http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZlcmxvZ2ljMy5jb20vbG0vcnRsMy5hc3A/c2k9NSZrPWFydCUyMGdhbGxlcnk="">art gallery</a>, and then let it starve to death. For days people watched it starve to death. Why no one just cut the fucking rope and took it out of there, I'll never know, but that's neither here nor there. What is important is that the Visual Arts Biennial of the Central American, a fairly prestigious art show, was so impressed by this ""masterpiece"" that they've invited this dick to do it all over again. Sweet. Long and short of it is that there's a petition you can sign to make sure another animal doesn't suffer the way this poor dog did. It's directly below.

That's all there is to it.

we left at 4:50 from school, made a stop, got to the park as soon as it opened and was even lucky enough to be within the randomly selected group that received free fastpasses during the Star Wars ride! I rode tower of terror twice and the Rockin Roller coaster, went behind the scenes of Indiana Jones, Beauty and the Beast, and Lights, Motors, Action.

My respect for Disney and what they do at these parks is absolutely up the roof and I feel so fortunate to have gotten to see all that I did.

The bus ride back was great, it was a non-stop party filled with makeshift strobe lights and amateur lap dancers.

It was the funnest I've had in a very long time.
And quite frankly, I feel bad for all the other strands in school because I doubt they'll ever have the same sense of gratification that a lot, if not most of us, got by seeing all the different things these men and women do and how talented they all were.

it was fucking great.

oh and I meant Hollywood studios."

"event","I CANNOT wait for the MGM trip next Friday, it'll be a great release from the stressful midterm week coming on.

I've always really loved going on road trips mostly because of that time spent in the car (truck, bus, etc.)
There's something liberating and extremely fascinating about hearing that elusive sound of the asphalt escaping beneath the tires of a vehicle and watching the trees and the dirt hills becoming elongated blurs as you speed by.

It's gonna be a BLAST."

"event","I was finally indulged. Saw Sweeney Todd, today. and it was fantastic and all was well in the world.

It was.. absolutely amazing. beautiful, really. Gorgeous photography; Dariusz Wolski at his best. I loved it. I'm dying to see it a second time; I think only once you've seen a movie multiple times can you truly begin to appreciate it for all its details.

Ugh, just thinking about the work I have to get done is intoxicating. 5 paintings, fix 2 others; finish a book, finish all the SAT prep work.
On the other hand.. I got to see Sweeney Todd.

"event","The Christmas party at the neighbor's house was nice. Though at 11 I basically shut off my brain: exhaustion will do that to you.

The most fulfilling part of the night was seeing that even my dog got some gifts. Strange, right? I imagine it's a similar fulfillment when a child is gifted something by a friend. He absolutely <i>loved</i> the little angry dog chew toy. And the stuffed bone chew toy. And the pair of doggy tennis balls. And the doggy rope.. 

The other really, hilariously fulfilling part of this evening was seeing all the kids (and adults alike, it was indiscriminate) stick their hands into the snack bowl. Um, yeah, I should mention that the snacks were for the Maltese in the house.
Even when the doggy bag was standing next to the bowl, they kept digging in; I guess they must've been damn good yogurt doggy snacks."

"event","Oh, good lord Jesus, I wish I had had more money to blindly spend this holiday season! P.s. anyone who shops at Urban Outfitters--- you are disgusting, please go get hit by a car. Only then will anyone prefer to feel pity for you rather than hate for you, as you do not know the value of a dollar.

On an entirely different note.
I don't really like the holidays all that much. In fact, they kind of depress me. is that bad?

Not that I mind being with my family. no. And I actually quite love being away from school for two weeks (<i>love</i>). I like presents, and sometimes I won't get them, but that's never been a reason for my bitter feelings towards the holidays. 

I think it's the fact that my family needs a paid holiday to bring them together that makes me sad. 
That and I've been walking around in short shorts and a tank top. Christmas without snow can be such a bummer."

We got there at 11:15, waited till 12:50. Adam Ramirez and two other comedians were on stage before Pablo Francisco, but once he got on there, the theatre was on fire.

I'm so happy I got to go! I wish I had had 10 more bucks, could've bought a DVD and their autographs.

"event","art Basel was cool.
really, the thing I lamented the most was how the prices were not displayed this year around; the funnest part last year was seeing terrible art and then seeing their 'value'. It's funny, but the lack of quality of a piece is directly proportional to its price.

The Matisse selections were cause for depression. Same for Picasso. Obviously same for Britto.
All the same, it was impressive to be that close to something I've read about all these years."

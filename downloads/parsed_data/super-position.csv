"event","A strange summer set of waves came through today. From that huge hurricane spinning southward. I really hope one similar doesn't hit us later(I'll probably will be quoting this later). I got a new board being built, and it's about 200 dollars less to have a board custom built than to buy on e prebuilt which is crazy. It's a 5'10'' fish it'll be pretty meaty. 
Instead of being smart and saving for a rainy day or a vehicle I'm spending money on a Hawaii trip over Christmas. But might as well because one should travel when they have the chance. I hope the surf isn't giant when I'm there or I'll be scared. If it is and I'm scared I'll have a great time anyway. I'll get to meet Alex's brother who surfs and does physics. 
There should be a Miami party in the next month. 
So on and so forth."

"event","I went to South Carolina this weekend. It was pretty cool. We stayed with Alex's cousin's grandparents; this would make me the grandchild's cousin's boyfriend. This people are the nicest people, hillybillies, but really great. One can really get a feel for what type of people are around because the nextdoor neighbor had made a semi-trailer into a permanent structure. Their house was right on a delta-swampish type area and the tide would fluctuate about 10 feet. It's a great place. I got to go surfing behind a boat with this awesome board from the 70's that was made at Nomad. I'm probably going to get one made similar to that in the next month or so. 
I'm not working till the 23rd of August so I'm free for some partying if anyone is down.

"event","I think I choose a great few weeks to have my motorcycle worked on. It's been raining just about every day while going to work, and Alex's mom was out of town so I could borrow Alex's car. 7-800 dollars for the repairs, but all together I haven't really paid that much in repairs so it's in due course. 
I learned statics in the last week or so. It's the watered-down non-rigorous  version so it was quite easy, yet still interesting. That's all I really got down in the last week. Except today. Today I got about 100 things done to my room and around the house. I broke a window, I fixed a window, I tore up an old desk, I build I new desk, I put together a ceiling fan.... so on. 
Keys bridge fishing this coming weekend--anyone want to join? Probably Saturday, Sunday, and or Monday. Fish all night and day and what not. 
I'm becoming more bitter towards tutoring students. I don't really want to help many anymore. So I figure just don't, and that's what I've been up to the last few months. The funny thing about that is I got my yearly evaluation and since February I've logged the most responses to students--maybe everyone is more bitter than I am.

Patteroo<sup>2</sup> was quite fun. Mini-Robberoo was ,also, quite fun. Jesse was playing ""naked bingo"" instead of attending--which is fine, but the question comes up-- of all games to play naked why bingo? Was there more than two people playing? Does the person rolling around all the little balls get naked as well? and wouldn't the process of getting fully naked take several hours?
Chemistry II is almost done. It's quite easy but still I learned quite a bit. I'm looking forward for it to be over.
No more classes till Fall which I'm quite excited about. A lot of stuff planed to do. Fall classes will be fun--when they come I'll probably be saying I'm so bored of not having school. I'm taking Quantum Mechanics, Classical Mechanics, and Mathematical Physics. All of those classes will be very enlightening and probably a lot of work, but really really fun. 
This just happened: The phone rings in the dinning room. I'm in my room and I wait for my sister to answer it, she's ten feet from it, and she doesn't. I go out there to yell and answer the damn phone, and the person hangs up before I get there. I ask her ""why didn't you go answer the phone?"" She replies ""it wasn't for me"".

"event","Semester is almost over. I'm glad about this, not that I want to be done with my classes just I don't want to worry about them anymore. Which will last about 1.5 weeks because summer is calling for chemistry 2 to be taken. I'll need to brush up a lot on chem. It'll probably be easier now that I'm more learned. 
I've been noticing that a lot lately while in the mathlab. When I was in physics 1 I encountered all these problems and I spent hours solving them. Now I go to help students with the same problems and I can solve any of them without any effort at all. 
I'll show you an example about my new equation build skills. By emperical observation:
*points out* 
Before college: Matthew somewhat savy, but rather cumbersome and dull. 
3 years into college: Matthew quite savy, and rather sharp.
Equation: Person + highschool (american) = stupid and about as sharp as an apple.
Person + college + <b>hardwork </b>= more of a honed edge. As sharp as, say, a dull knife. Dull knife because it's possible to be much sharper. 
Apply the logic, and do an experiment before argueing!
Bringing me to another point. America is stupid. Worst education system in the world per standard of living. Pappy has a book with the title something like why american's can't read, write, or add, yet still feel good about themselves. The feeling good about themselves is exactly why I sometimes get a very bad feeling aboiut helping people in the mathlab with their math. All I really do sometimes is sovle their problem, walk away, and give them a nice feeling inside. I'm disabling them the greif and inner torment which forces people, as I'm always, to strive to manipulate their brian into a problem solving and understanding machine. If you can be faced with a problem and be able to think effectly, prehaps not analyticly, you're just usless dead weight to society, to yourself, and to anyone you interact with! College isn't for getting drunk every weekend it's to teach one dissiplan and to be able to think! 
Surfing is like a garbage truck for the brain. Cleans and clears it of trash and muck. It's also great exercise. 
Hawaii this summer if it costs less than 500 dollars. If'nt maybe over christmas of next summer. 
If America is outsourcing so many jobs to give work to the stupid people in other countries, then what the hell are the stupid american's doing? Not working in factories! They're all in college annoying me and trying to feel good about themselves."

Physics is like beer and everything else is like liquor. In right order they work, but can go wrong when put together. If the author of your book is a pompus ass. If your teacher is an ADD ass. The book is terrible. The teach spent two class--TWO CLASSES-- proving an irrelvent formula! Whine -> 0 
I get angry with pompus people. There are some tutors in the math lab that I want to run over with a steam roller. I can run circles around both of them, yet they still find the need to boss me around, among just about everyone. Huh?
Daniel when are we coming to your apartment?
 Jesse when are you going to go to PBCC and at least try school before you dismiss is. Do you want 20 dollars for 1 dollar invested with a 99% probability of a return? Education is that bet. You don't have to go for a 4+ year degree. Go to a votech program and learn how to be something else than a minimum wage worker! I say friend it can't go wrong.

A few flakes of slow fell last night. Cold and nice. 
Graduate school might take me up north. 
There are superb waves right now. Hopefully will last till tomorrow so I can have some fun. 
2 more weeks of school. Then I'm off to FAU. Should be superb. I'm finding FAU offers much more than UCF. They have 2 semesters of undergraduate research! That's awesome. And they require you to take a two semester mathematical physics class! Which is freaking awesome! Aside from that, they don't offer as many classes than UCF, but the shit will still get learned. The dog in the class not the class around the dog? Something.
Jesse, Matthew, Alex = 21 years of age come january! Bitch. BItch bitch bitch. Really doesn't mean than much because drinking isn't all that fun to do very offten, and I've been buying alcohol for the past year or so already. 
Vector and Tensor Analysis is a great class, so is Linear Algebra, but they're just math classes which is like showing you pictures of shoes and maybe trying some shoes on, but not really getting to go walking around and or running in them. 
More shoes: I figure undergraduate is like learning how to walk, and when you get your undergraduate(physics is what I'm mainily speaking of) degree is like getting your first pair of shoes. It's not really that you should be able to run and jump and do whatever it is people do in shoes. It's more like you're able to walk and now it's just time to learn(grad) to run and jump and climb in those shoes. IE mastering the use of those shoes. I keep harping onmyself about how after, 20 credits, of physics I'm not able to move around freely in any theories, but it's not like I should expect to climb a mountian after just learning how to crawl! Shit. 
You should stop by the literature section of your library and find a book on limmericks and read it, you'll laugh. 
There is a girl named Alex. She's the most splendid thing. She's like a best friend, that's extremely attractive, and you enjoy sexing her! I really don't think I could ask for more in a person. 
Minky might get an apartment, I might live with her, charlee might live with her, I don't want to live with charlee, charlee is nice in very small doeses.

Got a car till the end of thanksgiving break. It's not that great. 
I may be able to pull of all A's, if my vector and tensor teacher decides not to put questions which are ""intended for no one to get right"" on the exams. 
Too much studying and not enought other things makes one get sick of stuff they love.
Kitty is a crazy mother fucker. I think she's bored. 
Football is enjoyable sometimes, but not when the ratio is 1 dollar to physics for every 1000 for football. 
To the store. Need food. 
Alex is a girl that I want to make love to everyday!
I got a long board, perfect condition for--70 dollars!!! fins were 70 thus new surf board for 140 dollars! Don't leave anyhting at a girlfriends house then never call her again then they sell it for a 1/3 of what it's worth.

School is getting easier. I'm just hating UCF more and more each time I go there. I can't find an area in the entire school where I can get more than 5 minutes without having a heard of morons walk by surely going to ""study"" somewhere. I get really fed up with people who don't respect college for being a place of learning. I was on the phone tonight with Alex's mother and she was saying in Hawii, where her son teachs physics, that they hold teachers and school much higher than we do here(A TV-AntiEducation connection?). That just shows us how stupid america is becoming. Hopefully, probably, it's a cyclic progression where generations mount who take living well for granted then their children get screwed over by them, and relize values. I just need to model it with a differential equation and write a paper! America's stupid.

I got a 100 on one test, an 85 on one, and a 40 on the last(all values being rounded to the nearest mulitple of 5). The 100 was because the test wasn't that difficult. The 85 because I made two little mulitplication errors which shouldn't have been that big of a deal but the teacher is chinese--yeah :). The 40 becuase I'm a retard,that should have been at least an 80. But that 40 is a B with the curve. Still no excuses or happyness because a curve.

Americans are average in their levels of intelligence but what they lack is any sort of relization of suffering at all. My nemisis is the retarded american soccer mom. Dumbest most closed minded people in america. Anything that doesn't appear to be perfect and nice is the devil. All those people are good for is  sitting around and making dinner and bithcing about how there is too much curse words on TV, I'm not just speaking of women I'm speaking of the entire family which is like that. Sadder, they're so bored they form committes and vote in hoards. How does someone get elected by saying they'll keep this country safe? These are the people that go and complain about how the US army is--get this--killing people!!! Oh no, this can't be, and army who KILLS PEOPLE?! When their kids leave what do they do? Well, nothing, so they drink. Not always but this is typical of the soccer mom breed. Most likely they own an suv or two, and have some sort of bag which costs more than 300 dollars, and those that don't have those usually want them. Waste of an opinion these people are. Maybe a product of a well-off country. 
I got a kitty. It's little and grey and rather cute. It's a spirited little gal; won't let you pick her up, but when you do she adores it. I hope I have enough time for her. 
Mommy came, brought me the kitty. Made me breakfest, which was great. Went over to campus and thought it was nice. 
Just got done with three tests. They weren't too hard but if I don't recieve an A on each I get this horrid feeling that I didn't master the material. I don't really care about an A becasue it's an A. I care more about not mastering the material. Physics is something I want to master. I study till I'm unable to think about it anylonger becasue I want to master the subject. Physics is beautiful and I'm going to give it my all. I got a B on one test, of which I'm ok with because the only errors I made was little silly stuff, which I am really upset with myself, but I mastered the material so I'm not angry. SO whateva mang. 
Boynton next weekend. Get to see my baby. Oh my I just love that girl sooooo much. It sounds silly but she is just about perfect in my eyes.

"event","A few days ago I was attempting to work out a physics problem. I was on a roll of working out a bunch of problems, and was in a fury. Jumping into this problem it didn't occur to thing about it at all, and the result was trying too many things too many different ways. The result was not being, nor being willing. to think about how to find a solution to this problem. I waited about two days, then found the solution. That problem mirrors my state of being right now. I have two or three problems or situations that I'm currently in or going through, and I have such a jumpy, non-focusing mind that I go through so many solutions and differnt opinons that I just drive myself nuts. One moment I want to be a lonely professor piddling about a university, the next I want to be a cheery family man going to work just to want to go home. The fact is about most stuff like that is I don't know anything about either of those things so I really shouldn't be planning or thinking about either! I should just be going to school and focusing on that. But to say that is like telling someone ""I can't tell you"". It's just a given to think about the future! I hate to worry about it but it's what I do. I drive myself nuts. Which is probably why I'm awake at 530 and can't sleep. I haven't fallen asleep at a decent hour for a while. My mind won't shut down, and it makes me anxious. Ah poop. I'll get over it. 
I just watched Closer. Quite a good movie. Julia Roberts nose reminded me of Alex's. And that other girl in there really reminded me of Alex's delicately cute personality. Mushy--I don't care, she's my lovely. 
Physics is difficult, but I just have to get use to learning this type of material in a more efficent manner. I've only ever have one of two of these types of classes at a time, so I never had to steam line my learning technique to be able to effeicently take in all this good material enough. I also have to get use to working problems blind, where is no anwser and no solutions to any problems. I thought of this analogy the other day. Math is like grammer. Grammer is logical but is often times hard to feel an inner connection to. Literature--stories and novels, and poetry are built of grammer they offer an inner connection to your everyday life. Physics does the same for math by connected it the world. 
Six in the morning and I'm still not asleep. I have to do a bunch of homework tomorrow and don't think I'll be up till all hours of the afternoon which is going to do me something aweful when it carries over to monday morning. In turn causing me to sleep late on tuesday, and so forth. See how I grobble over little nothings and it just screws me more than the little piddly stuff I was grobbling over in the beggining. 
I'll try to go to sleep now."

Most extremist religious stuff is stupid because people are brainless. Why are there bunches of different religions? Because people listen to themselves and try to read the mind of god. Can people read the mind of God? Not at all in the least. So why do people try, well probably because people are stupid. All these people who boast about how godly they are commit blasphemy because they think they are somewhere near God's level where they dare judge other people and go as far as saying what god thinks and what he would do. WHY? Because people are idiots!! Worry about what you are doing. Not what other people are doing. If it's something bad that harms you, then maybe do something about it, else mind your own business. Yes people are gay, and if you think that's sooo bad don't be gay. Simple as that. Don't climb up onto a pedestal of your own making to look down on what these people are doing because there are many things just about everyone does that can be looked down upon by God.

Classes are cool. Very fast paced. All of them are going over the same bit of vector analysis right now which is a wee bit boring. They should start getting a little different soon. I've been very bored sitting at school with little to do. I've been pondering a lot, and I've solidified a fear that after all this school I will have master nothing. Also, another thing that has surfaced is that I'm one impatient mother fucker. I wish my schooling was over and I'd know everything that I'm going to want to learn. Just got to wait for that shit.

It's kind of broke down, and homely, and for a guy like myself there doesn't seem like there's much to do,  but spend money and fight traffic. I am missing people a lot more than I thought I would, and I really miss the ocean no matter how cliche it sounds. Living on my own ain't bad, it's fun, but I have an isolated feeling being up here  on my own. yeah yeah cry cry whatever. The bar last night was fun, but that's one of those things that's fun every now and again. 
School so far is ok, it took me an just under an agervating hour to get here this morning which is one of my worst nightmares. Then I had to get a parking pass, and pay a ticket. Then my bike refused to start and keep running which is another of my worst nightmares(the last one would be my computer dieing which already happened once). My Electricity and Magnetism class will be cool yet easy, and I almost had to shoot these two rejects who can only talk  a massive amount of trash about math and science and probably both couldn't tell you about anything else. The sadder part is I could still kick the shit out of them when it comes to any actual math or science. 
I still need to get a job, but VCC is out till the 28th. I was thinking about applying at this pizza place to learn how to make pizzas, which is cool. I don't know I'll see. 
Alex is coming this weekend which makes me smile uncontrollably. I love that girl. She's great; she's the type of girl that just sitting there is as fun as going out and doing something. I don't think I can imagen a more perfect girl for me. I just love her, and I just miss her.

Sitting there not having anything to do except work on physics all day, which I generally love doing, has caused me to burn myself out. I'm taking a vow to not do much physics work for about a week, to allow myself time to regroup.  This topped with all the other crap that I'm having to do has just made me into someone not very fun to be around. I hate it becasue I get pissy at Alex.

I seriously have ADD or something, but whatever!
I just used Patricks faculities, and that toilet paper really isn't very nice to one's bum. 
I've been looking at all the classes that I have to take and it's just daunting starting from scratch again.  It's only 1.5- 2.0 more years till I'll be done with this degree, whatever it may be. I remember starting at PBCC and being rather scared of all the class that I had to take, and almost all of them ended up being easy. I really hope this ends up being like this as well.
My ears have been bothering my over the last week which is a bunch of crap. 
I really don't like Patricks key board. It's really sticky.
We need to do some apartment shopping. 
Everyone else is at Sea World. 
Orientation was pointless, seriosly pointless. 
My new computer needs to get here already. It had to be backordered or something--won't be here till like the 14th or 15th or some dump crap. 
Riding up here wasn't bad at all. A bit over two hours on a route with no tolls.  I figured it would be rainy on the way up but there was barely any coulds. It was nice, as gay as it sounds. 
Patrick's mouse is really sensitive. Two inches of movement and the cursor moves the entire way arcost the screen. Not a bad thing. The keyboard however...
I'll need a job here.
I'll need to make the lady come up here some, or something. She really is the greatest lady I've ever been involved with by far. I just can't seem to get annoyed with anything she says, AND she's pretty and nice beyond anything. 
Patrick has a cologne called ""Very Sexy""
I went and got some coffee at star bucks, then spilled it on my legs while driving back with 1/4 of it. 
OK, now, it's letting me sign up for 1 class out of the 2 that I thought I'd be able to take, FUCK. 
Weird thing about the lady. That silly poetry book Miss Bush made way back when. Right? Well I was glancing through it and I noticed under the ""feartured artist"" it was Alexandrea Seiler. Exactly! 
I've read just under half the bible, and I enjoy it. A good quote from Jesus is ""you must be like a child to love me"" meaning true faith lies in simple thoughts about religion. Don't over think anything  and there in will be salvation. 
The Bible is actaully a lot different than I thought it would be.
Patrick has a lot of books about the Bible in his room. 
I'm probably going to go walk around or something soon. 
I was thinking today, it goes in line with about half that movie ""A beautiful mind"", about ideas, and research. The one thing all the great scientists had in common was they simpified an idea down, they focused the mess down to one oberservation or thought. And that was their brillance, what followed didn't take someone who was a mentle giant to figure out, it just takes someone with the originality and foresight to simplify a problem down to the physical law that governs it.

4. Gainsville is a kind of nice town (town because it's no city)
5. Nuclear Engineering
<u>UF(bad)</u>

2. Gainsville is a town which could easly equate to being boring
3. I don't really know very many people up there. 
4. Probably harder to get a sholarship there.

1. good engineering program, although not as good as UF's.
2. Great physics program. 
3. Cool people go there.
4. Closer
5. NASA intership?
6. More to do in Orlando than Gainsville
<u>UCF(bad)</u>
1. More expensive housing
2. The engineering program that's not as good, but still really good. 
3. Haven't seen it yet.

This PBCC raise thing rules. 

MotorRider is a little sick. The starter clutch needs to be replaced, the clutch needs to be worked on, and it's missing right as it revs up to 5000 rpm, which could be about 10 different things. All of those are things I really don't want to attemp myself, so it'll be costly.

"event","St Patricks day was--a night I learned several lessons.  It was however a hell of a lot of fun!
lessons:
1. A lot of drinking costs a lot of money. Bill for that night = 68 dollars. I really hope you laugh at that because it deserves to be laughed at.
2. Drinking too much will make you sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick.
3. You say really funny things when you drink 50 dollars worth of booze. 
-for example: ""I'm not getting into the car till I see some boobies""
A bunch of other stuff that I just don't remember, but I know I said it. 
I think I'd be a lot better at the drums than the guitar. 
Falling asleep in your yard, then waking up in the shower when all the hot water ran out is funny!"

"event","Hiking was a fun time. Saw just about every animal one could think of in florida. It was quite cold, and two small blankets wasn't nearly enough.  Fun time. 
Miami was also fun. Riding down with Rob was quite fun. Dan, Lauren, and other people were very hospitable. AH! Riding home was less fun, both bikes weren't running good, and traffic was quite bad.  After Rob got off to go to work I joined up with a bunch of bikers and we terrorized everyone down the road. I'm probably going to need to replace my starter or rebuild it(if that's possible with my primitive automotive skills)."

Kitty runs jumps on me, she's all wet for some reason, and jumps off--she's looney. 
Daniel calls me while he's drunk and makes me laugh.
I got a new motorcycle helmet, a better quality one. 
Diff eq test = me messing up a question I helped about 3 people figure out in the math lab...stupid stupid stupid.
I'm going to change my picture on this thing. 
I'm going to write a story based on schubert's erlking.
There's this crude guy that slidled up to me in the mathlab. He's funny, he makes fun of everyone else in the mathlab. He's a forman or something for a construction company and supervised the building of the ETA, or so he say's but I see no reason to doubt him.  He get's pretty angry at the math because he hates learning it.  Something or other. 
Truly man."

"event","2/28 Spring break next week, going hiking pappy, may do some other stuff, may try to read the hitch hikers guide series, may try to go commerical fishing, may write my stupid short story, might just cook some tacos, I would kill someone for a taco right now.
3/1 5:00

3/1 7:30
tired, fucking tired, really fucking tired, being mentally tired is about 150 times worse than the worst case  of being physically tired. 
People are really starting to piss me off, I can't stand helplessness, whining, and people being bitchs. I'm in a mood to really yell at someone.

"event","""Ain't"" ain't a word and I ain't suppose to use it. 
Still haven't heard anything back from any universities yet, which is a pisser to say the least.  
Minky replaced her English friend with an Irish one. 
Write a program which can calculate 1000! if you do I'll give you a dollar.
I haven't a clue what to do today, there's nothing to do.  I may end up going to school because I'm bored, or I may go to barnes and noble and try to read an entire book there.
I hope someone decides to hang out with his friends tonight, and isn't dependant on what there is to drink there. 
I haven't gone surfing in about a month--which stinks.
A short story <30 pages. Why?
I'm bored. I guess I'll go find something to do.

"event","When to visit the Dolderer, Pedic, and company. Meet Rob and made the ride down--quite the fun little ride.  Motorcycling at higher speeds takes some getting use to but it feels safe, once you get use to the wind.  
Hanging out with the kids there--""good times great kids"", despite having to leave early to see relatives. I got to do this again!
I'm tired, time for sleeping.
I just noticed livejournal now has an autosave function--great idea."

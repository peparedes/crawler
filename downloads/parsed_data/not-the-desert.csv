"event","<P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Naisip ko lang to write about this kasi i feel this is more than just coincidence. </P> <P>Five months ago, i was really planning to get out of my church for some reasons that i do not really understand. Landslide tlga yung faith ko. Siguro yun tlga yun. Effect na din ng lahat ng nangyari for the past years. Kaya nga when i got my incomplete grade sa eee 105. I didn't even bother to wonder. Di na rin ako nagreklamo. I know it was because of that.</P> <P>After those months, i still go to church. Pero honestly, it was all different- the feeling that you can't connect. ganun. and forgive me for the term but it really sucks.Umabot pa sa point that i can't even pray dahil nahihiya na ko tlga. </P> <P>i was having my daily dose of text conversations/sermon with jaj nung naalala ko yung transfer ko that i got from the church sa QC. I was going to the church without letting them monitor kung nakapunta nga ako. To explain it simply,&nbsp; wala akong record kasi nasa kin nga. </P> <P>I was sort of nagsusumbong dahil nga dun sa text messages ni ralph sa kin. After almost years na di na naman kami nag-uusap about us and what had happened, he accused me of destroying his relationship. He told me na i sort of planned a scheme to put him in an awkward situation na di nya matatanggihan, and un nga. I don't even know his girl personally. All i know is her name and the fact that they are both from BA.And wala din akong makitang reason why i would still wanna do that dahil nung summer naman we saw each other and we're pretty good.&nbsp;O well, the conversation ended with him calling me as a ""sick bitch."" He even told me i was capable of making stories and set-ups. </P> <P>At that time, i wanted to pretend that it's all cool. But then, i can't. </P> <P>Maybe it really matters to me, he became a part of my life and his opinions do count kasi he became important to me. My family liked him and some of my friends still do. (Pero when they hear this, i don't think ganun pa din).</P> <P>Mejo naguguluhan tlga ko and i was really crying myself to sleep. Weak tlga ko when it comes to friends saying not-so-decent things about me. And i also know for a fact, na di ko naman ginawa. I should be unaffected but i can't play the role very well. Siguro dahil mag isa na naman ako sa boarding house kaya ganun.&nbsp;I don't really know.</P> <P>Anyways, yun nga. Nag-uusap kami about that when my cousin texted me. It was a forwarded quote about faith and then suddenly naalala ko nga na it's about time that i should return the file back. I told Jaj about it and he was happy. (I&nbsp;know he had been praying for it for months) He was even supportive of the idea that i should change number para di na kami magkatext ni ralph. </P> <P>The day after that&nbsp;was our regular thursday church ""together."" (Sa loob kasi ng church di naman kame nagkikita. hehe) Pero i felt relieved nung nakita ko xa. Dahil siguro alam ko na rin na may kasama na ko. Nasa panic mode pa ko and i was asking him kung pano ako uuwi ng Laguna. (Dahil out of way sa kanya.) He told me to not worry and even told me ""Nagmamadali ka ba?"" Haha. So i just shut up. </P> <P>The preach was for me. I know and i felt it. Palabas na kami when he held my hand and told me ""Narinig mo teksto o nakatulog ka?"" habang natatawa pa xa. Di na lang ako nagcomment. Hehe. He told me to fix my stuff and then we'll eat out. </P> <P>After that, pumunta pa kami ng taft para maencode&nbsp; (nya) &nbsp;yung ""salaysay"" ko. (na xa gumawa. hehe) It was a letter na nag-aapologize for getting that file and for keeping it. Tapos dun na rin ako sumakay sa Buendia bus station to Laguna. </P> <P>Right now, i feel so relieved that i'm going back to Church.&nbsp;Siguro nga this is what's been missing kaya feeling ko din na parang may kulang. :) Yung kay ralph, bahala na xa dun. Di ko na rin makita yung point kung makikipag-usap pa ko about it dahil wala na ring sense, the damage is done.</P> <P>Hopefully, lahat will fall to its place and kahit may sakit na nman ako, i do feel that i'm gonna be all right. :)</P> <P>note: nagpromise na si jaj about the tagaytay trip sa birthday ko. hehehe. i want some time off from EEE and the pressure&nbsp;from graduating as well. :)</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P><!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","<P>after months of rigorous work and days of no sleep..i've learned the important details of the job.. i even tried questioning myself at some point, some of the sacrifices don't make much sense.. instead of gaining new friends by being sociable and all, you only end up having people around you making every work&nbsp;seem harder. </P> <P>i could never deny the fact that at some point, i might have missed..&nbsp; maybe because i lack the experience or the passion to work perhaps. I deal with strangers and i don't know how they think- that fact was very dangerous.</P> <P>I failed because all the while, i was finding self-gain.. that maybe somehow i could have something all for yourself. But then&nbsp;when&nbsp;all works were being thrown right on&nbsp;my face, i began to panic.. not only because i might disappoint myself but the whole committee.. and then the idea of self-gratification ceased, all that was left is pub work. nothing more.. nothing less..</P> <P>Yes. I became obsessive with what i do. Up to some point maybe that the scope of my job widened. I am a publicity officer and my main duty is to keep all event of the committee publicized.. but then i find it hard to focus on just a single task -- making avps.</P> <P>Being exposed to so much pub works, there was a time i called the committee a 'slave committee.' All things that you should do depends on other committee's decision. You should be aware of the tiniest detail just to effectively publicize and promote it. </P> <P>I love the job. </P> <P>Though there are times i feel that the job was not for me. The first time we had an internal conflict in the committee, i thought about filing a resignation. All because it was not in my intentions to hurt anybody or to involve myself personally.. I wanted a working relationship, with each of the members of the committee just to make all plans materialize..</P> <P>Having meetings till midnight and working for a pub project overnight, you can't help but just to be close to them.. Having wonderful lunch and dinners, you can't help but to be used to their company up to some point when all of you speak in a certain accent&nbsp;and utter words&nbsp;that other groups find odd. You become a part of a group that aims for one thing - fruitful regime.</P> <P>Having meetings till midnight and burning shoulders, sometimes you can't help but to hate them for sometimes being so nosy.. or maybe just being critical.. Sometimes, when the time's not so good, you can't help but to just be annoyed with what&nbsp;they do.. or&nbsp;maybe with what you just can't accomplish.. </P> <P>It's just sometimes hard to accept that while there are those people who&nbsp;seem to be&nbsp;great workers, there are still those who are even greater. This realization is often left misunderstood. You envy and spend your time pulling them down instead of being inspired and pushing yourself up.</P> <P>The whole FOPC season was incredible. I was left tired. Yeah. But i was richer by having 21 friends.</P> <P>We may not be the best steercomm officers, or maybe even a lousy one. But one thing we are most proud of is that despite all transitions, we manage to pull things together.</P> <P>thanks a lot guys! :)</P> <P>Salamt din sa lahat ng mem orgs :)</P> <P>I need not to mention all of you.. who worked their asses off just to provide great publicity.. It was because of those people who worked with dedication who made so inspired and be still alive even without any sleep for two straight days. :)</P> <P>Thanks Danes! :) Great Danes ka tlga :)</P> <P>This would just be the start of our great friendship.. :) haha.. You told me i can do all of these, that's why i was able to do it somehow. The tireness is nothing compared to so much fun and bunch of new experiences :)</P> <P>Sa Steercom, wag nating kalimutan to..</P> <P>1. i go for...</P> <P>2. UPStage</P> <P>3. i suggest..</P> <P>4. Tampalicious!</P> <P>5. Unding</P> <P>6. Fiona at Shrek</P> <P>7. Kenny</P> <P>8. i say...</P> <P>9.and tili ni Maelyn!</P> <P>10. Welcome Freshies!</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>mamimiss ko kayo.. :)</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P><!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

i don't know why this song still have its effect on me.. yeah, maybe a part of me was broken there at a place where somebody left me.. maybe i'm a little bit too sensitive at this moment.. or maybe i'm getting numb.. 
i really don't know..

maybe someone would step up and just tell me i'm a hypocrite.. or maybe i'm forcing myself to fall.. or to divert everything there that could be diverted.. 
i was gonna say, i'm just happy.. or maybe even having this little contentment.. or maybe i'm just getting wiser.. 

i'm taking my time.. although mine's not plenty..
i wanna give myself a chance again.. or maybe i'm just being impatient..
i'm not sure.. of anything..

it's a shame to admit.. that i might need your help..
..again..
i really wanna be in full control of everything that slipped..
but i guess it's just that i can't have control..
for whenever i do.. i mess up.. :(

and maybe someone would step up and just tell me i'm continuously hurting you.. or i am just playing again..
i was gonna say, i'm just happy.. with you around.. 

and i feel sorry for the things that were not meant to be said.. words that should never be written.. i want a start.. not a continuation..

i'll see you lunch tomorrow.. :)"

The perilous deep part is blue.. the shallow one's green.. <br /><br />there's the volcano surrounded by waters.. just standing there as if it can't harm anyone in its surroundings.. playing dead.. although it's very active inside.. <br /><br /><i>i've known you.. the part of you that's blue and the part that is green..<br />but as you play dead.. the more i tend to worry..<br />how i wish that i could just ignore it.. the beauty of our friendship.. that captivated me..<br />you seem to be so peaceful.. seems that you can't harm..<br />but by just standing there as i observe you.. you could break me..<br /><br />burst it out.. all the lavas flowing inside.. no matter how destructive it could cost..<br /><b><br /></b></i><b>fourth stop: Josephine's restaurant, Tagaytay City<br /><br /></b>We ordered seafood paella, crabs, squid, and prawns.. (hands down to the chef!).. the place was indeed lovely.. i can still see the volcano and the peaceful lake.. We had great conversations.. about sushis and sashimis.. about italian pasta.. about the current Philippine economic situation.. the call center industries spreading so fast like a plague.. <br /><br /><i>We had a lot of moments together such as this.. eating together and having a lot of laughs.. <br />What happened? were they all forgotten? <br />..lost in the same manner as how the depressing current situation of the country swept away our smiles.. <br />i miss those times just hanging around.. eating together..<br />but thinking about how much you've hurt me and made me felt like i don't exist..<br />i don't even wanna long for those times again..<br />yeah.. you can make me smile.. this much.. <br />and you can make me cry.. million times as much..<br /><br /></i><b>next stop: fruit stand</b><br /><i><br /></i>to be continued...<br /><br /><i><br /><br /><br /><br /></i><br /><br /><b><br /><br /></b><br /><br />"

"event","<strong><br /><br /><font size=""3"">launching... <br /></font></strong><br />I was standing on a cemented parking lot.. with aching neck and body.. i was thinking about me, standing there during that moment. I found it kinda odd.. after days of not having lunch with my friends.. i was hanging out with them.. again.. after the cold holiday season break.. <br /><br />I had my new year's wish.. the same old wish for five consecutive years.. I was just gazing at the sky.. just observing its vastness.. its emptiness.. <br />Will i be able to nail it this year? I was given another chance to experience another new year's eve..another chance to wish.. <br /><br />--- <br /><em>Every new year's eve, i always try to watch aerial fireworks.. i've always believe that they bring blessings.. that they will color your sky not only for that night but all year 'round.. that the&nbsp;loud sounds will fill all silence that sadness brings.. that the lights will send you to enlightenment.. <br /><br />the midnight came.. count downs were off.. car alarms gone wild.. an indescribable chaos.. i can't perceive even a single tone.. i can't see a thing.. but i'm so sure that all these were happening.. a hundred percent.. <br /><br />New year's day had come.. all i wanted is to be asleep.. so i won't see the same old images.. i won't hear the same sound.. won't have to do the same things.. i wanted a new start.. don't wanna wait for the whistles.. the horns.. the greetings.. the usual celebration.. <br /><br />I turned off my phone.. never greeted anyone.. i just prayed.. and went back to sleep.. <br /></em>--- <br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">sparkling...</font> <br /></strong><br />Golden sparkles started to appear in the sky.. forming a spherical shape.. they were like gems.. gigantic ones.. covering the black dull sky.. i was so amazed..uttered wows in different levels of excitement.. they were awesome.. <br /><br />I started having doubts.. ""should i be here or should i be somewhere else?"" or the right question would be ""Do they ever want me here?"" I don't wanna be the cause of delay..or of anything that could ruin their first night out for this year.. <br />The colorful rings appeared.. they were like moving closer and closer towards me..I felt nauseous.. for the nth time.. felt the baggages pulling my shoulders down.. ""why was I here?""<br /><br />A certain chaos.. ""i can't be here""..<br /><br />Then I started smiling ang giving out some laughs.. not the fake ones.. i was with some friends.. and they were having a good time.. giggling at even the corniest joke.. you could see them teary-eyed.. still laughing out loud..&nbsp;<br /><br />--- <br /><em>I wish i could get her smile.. paste it to my face.. laugh the way she does.. ""am i that miserable, up to a point that smiling became a luxury?"" <br /><br />Having another year sounded not so good to me.. another year.. sounded too much.. <br />I tried to think 'bout some things.. on how i can change my life.. to turn it into something quite fun.. considered a lot of new additions.. new friends.. new someone special.. new look..new contact number.. but nothing made much sense.. <br /><br />For years, i have been used to memory-erasing.. eliminating things that makes my life uncomfortable..just forgetting 'bout them.. hoping it'll make&nbsp;everything&nbsp;turn out right.. <br />For years, i have been suffering from the same dilemma.. having unfulfilled years.. i didn't improve..<br />For this year i've decided, i should live life alone in my own thinking box...&nbsp;<br /></em>--- <br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">booming...</font></strong> <br /><br />The delayed booming sound came next.. making all those people gain much energy.. still alive at 1am.. <br /><br />I could hear&nbsp; it clearly now.. i'm having another new year's eve with my closest friends.. headaches and pains quickly vanished with just two 500mg tablets and a coke light..&nbsp;<br /><br />I wanted to indulge.. in gazing at those amazing flashes of gunpowder.. forming different light colors and shapes..&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>hearts that signify love..&nbsp;<br />spheres that signify completeness..<br />lines that symbolize eternity..&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />I wanted to freeze the time.. or just to make it run a bit slower.. to treasure the moment i'm having.. so that for every doubt that i have inside comes with a certain reason why i wanna stick with them..&nbsp;<br /><br />they make me feel worthed.. <br /><br />---<br /><em>what comes next when you think you're standing right on the edge of the gutter?.. should you fall and let all sadness blankets you every new year's eve?.. stay pessimistic on everything and continue playing the role of a depressed and disturbed soul?<br /><br />should you be nostalgic? hang on to something that's now nowhere to be found? put your high hopes on a nine-digit number that could mean something or might mean nothing at all?<br /><br />does new year means brand new? or just a&nbsp;restoration of &nbsp;some remnants of your last year's life?&nbsp;<br /><br />should a beautiful start of friendship be hindered with some issues of the past? or should a friendship be sacrificed for the sake of some unwanted feelings and just accept that fate led&nbsp;me&nbsp;farther away&nbsp;from&nbsp;that circle? &nbsp;<br /></em>---<br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">vanishing flashes...</font><br /></strong><br />marks of gold lightens up the sky.. now that the fireworks display is over.. the black sky is once again owned solely by the moon..

My numbness was gone.. and so was the power.. i was&nbsp;then the opressed..&nbsp;<br /><br />i couldn't focus on just a single thing.. and i continued cursing myself.. for all the wrong decisions.. for choosing the wrong way when i was at crossroads.. for disappointing the people who cares.. for not meeting my own expectations.. for indulging myself into drunkenness that made me realize all these things.. for having no logical reasons at all.. <br /><br />i developed a ball of anger and threw it at myself.. i started to vomit.. release all the toxins of liquor.. all the stuffs i ate.. all the gastric juices.. my bile.. my blood.. finally, i was left fragile.. my knees so weak and my hands were shaking..&nbsp;<br /><br />i continued cursing myself.. make noises which no one could interpret..till i fell asleep.. <br /><br />***<br /><br /><em>i don't know what magic does it brings.. why do you still need to have it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It just caused you to turn away from reality.. i told you, you can't live in your dreams..&nbsp;don't be nostalgic. your time has passed..all you can do is to look ahead..&nbsp;<br /><br />i'm sorry sometimes i tend to disrespect you..&nbsp;by doing such, it doesn't mean i don't mind your importance..it's just that sometimes, i feel like i don't wanna listen.. to all the sob stories and depressing thoughts.. it causes me pain and pessimism.. i don't wanna look at life the way you do.. like it's been so unfair.. for it's not. We were given our own chances.. the time of our lives.. and you wasted spme of yours..&nbsp;<br /><br />it's not yet done.. you're still here.. focus on something that's more important.. your baggages are already heavy, don't make it heavier..

How i wished that was the case.. but my theories are now failing..&nbsp;all things are working improperly<br /><strong><br /><font size=""2"">Results and Analysis</font></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but you&nbsp;wanted to detach yourself.. that's how i interpreted your actions..i know you have the abiltiy to close your heart forcibly.. but what about me?&nbsp;i couldn't&nbsp;just move on..&nbsp;having&nbsp;this megaohm of resistance..&nbsp;it has me completely&nbsp;stuck..<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how to analyze.. Your enigma..made it&nbsp;much worse..&nbsp;made me felt like i was the only one exerting the effort.. your&nbsp;blank face never left even a single clue.. about what's going on inside.. your&nbsp;silence&nbsp;caused&nbsp;me paranoia..&nbsp;we&nbsp;could've fixed it..&nbsp;the situation should then be much better than what it is now.. :(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><font size=""2""><strong>Conclusion</strong></font>&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;I wanted&nbsp;to prove that what i felt was&nbsp;just a product of impulsiveness.&nbsp;It was something that should&nbsp;be long forgotten. I wanted to convince myself that i could move on that easily.. just like how i did before. I can walk with my head held high.. making all of&nbsp;them believe that what's inside me is some tolerable pain.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried hard not to&nbsp;do the usual thing when i'm healing.. i never get away from you.. instead i kept you close and continue living my days -- just like the ordinary ones.&nbsp;But then&nbsp;days made me suffer.. i can't follow the flow chart.. i'm so sorry.. i made assumptions.. and all the while i haven't noticed that i was falling inside an&nbsp;infinite loop<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't been at peace with myself eversince.. i usually arrive at nonsense interpretations.. various tests just made me so disappointed.. i expected too much.. results have taken me nowhere.. left me empty-handed and still broken..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still not giving it all up..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm seeing&nbsp; a lady with so much power and independence.. but on her&nbsp;back what you could see is nothing but emptiness. yeah, nobody will see her cry.. eventhough inside, she's rapidly disintegrating. Once she knew what would bring her&nbsp;immeasurable joy&nbsp;but she let it all slip away.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't wanna see myself there alone, writing some notes on a coffee shop.. reading some notes on the coffee table--&nbsp; just the thought of it scares me...<br /><br /><font size=""2""><strong>Recommendations</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how will&nbsp;all this still pursue.. i suggest try to&nbsp;keep the faith.. believe in something&nbsp;even if it's almost impossible..&nbsp;i suppose 'someone' would hear me.. and will&nbsp;help me to&nbsp;continue..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for now, what's&nbsp;more important.. is to fulfill all tasks written on the 'dreams' list..<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time is&nbsp;running fast.. i don't wanna be left behind.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><font size=""2"">Bibliography</font></strong><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My future with you is vivid..&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i know 'someone' would find a way.. to reconcile things. I know it's complicated but i'm willing to take the risk.. &nbsp;It wouldn't be easy but 'someone' will offer assistance..i reserved my ears for listening intently for&nbsp;the plans He has for me.. I know it's already been written and inscribed..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />i was supposed to write about something else..<br />last night.. i mean this early morn&nbsp; i was able to finish it..<br />i was doing my editing for some parts.. when suddenly..<br />poof!!!!<br />to look at it at the brighter side, maybe it was not really meant to be posted..<br />at least for now..<br />so RJ, i appreciate you trying to keep me alive and workin' till 230am.<br />sana makarelate ka dito.. =))<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I know i'm not the perfect person to write about this sacred topic.. well, i'm not yet married.. not even close to being a family woman. but for me, i think i don't need to be there just to talk about it. I've learned a lot about marriages.. the reason why they succeed and the causes of its failures.. i don't care whether the things i'll be writing here won't make any sense to you..&nbsp;coz i know for some people.. this won't&nbsp;be meaningless.<br /><br /><strong><em>MARRIAGE...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as an extension of engagement<br /><br /></em></strong>Some of us would think of marriage as a continuation of a special kind of relationship you shared with your partner..It is the perfect &nbsp;time when you'll be more free to express yourself to someone whom you think saw the light in you. The time of honeymoons.. that strengthen the bonds and keep you closer. The time where you feel like you already belong to someone.. and the time you wanna stay hopeful and optimistic.. about the life very much different from what you had before..<br /><br />For the bride, the mere fact of having his surname excites you the most.. knowing that somebody owns you now.. that someone is willing to take care of you.. you'll have this feeling that suddenly.. everything is right.. everything is complete.<br /><br /><br /><strong><em>MARRIAGE...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as an escape<br /></em></strong><br />There are a lot of different reasons for getting married.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some couples just felt it.. that it's the only thing that's missing -- the bond. For them, having a relationship that's truly pure and wonderful should be surrendered to a Being with all-embracing authority. They look at it as something created for two lost incomplete souls that have already found their peace in each other's arms.&nbsp;What they wanted is to leave their old unattached self and completely unite to become one..<br /><br />Some couples felt the need to have it... all because the moment wants it. A child is already at the doors.. just waiting for the 9th month. After some time, they will be parents.. and what they want is the best for the kid.. for it to have an 'ideal' family.. Eventhough they know their not prepared for everything that will come along.. still they took the risk of getting into it. For the baby.. think of the baby. They think it would be easier to just go through the marriage process than to explain it to the child..&nbsp;<br /><br />Some couples have just grown out of the usual relationship. After spending years together and &nbsp;feeling the accountability towards each other, they decided to take the relationship one step higher.. for it not to remain stagnant.. Individual dreams were realized and there's nothing left for them to do but to conspire their worlds.. in order to make it so alive. There's no more excitement.. boredom's killing both of them.. they have to get away with it..they have to consider the time.. they're aging.. and they need companion.<br /><br /><strong><em>MARRIAGE...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a lifetime commitment</em></strong><br /><br /><br /><em>For each decision we make, there comes responsibility not only as &nbsp;future parents but also as lifetime partners..</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes, we think that living in one roof would be enough for&nbsp;a marriage&nbsp;to work out.. well, it&nbsp;doesn't work that way..&nbsp;<br /><br />There will come a point that you might think you're completely tired of it... Having to understand each other,&nbsp;is becoming more and more&nbsp;stressful.. Then you might not notice, you eliminate time for each other..&nbsp;<br /><br />You don't have that much talk about yourselves.. about your insights and the way you feel about certain things. You&nbsp;do think it's not necessary for you to talk about such 'unimportant' details..&nbsp;Then the four walls of your home seems to leave no room for you to grow.. You'll now think you have done the wrong thing.. because after years of being with your partner, you found yourself feeling so drained..<br /><br />Now you realize the things that comes with marrying someone. that leaving is not as easy as entering.. You have to consider a lot of stuffs.. especially your children's sake..if there's any.. <br /><br /><strong><em>MARRIAGE...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a gift</em></strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Not everyone got married for the perfect reason.. But if you come to think of it, you had time to back out.. why would you push yourself into doing something that you don't really want...&nbsp;<em><br /><br />you decided at that moment when you swore.. to God and to the people of this world.. that you are willing to accept your partner in times of joy and strife.. till death separates the two of you..</em><br /><br />Not because you feel that marriage failed your expectations means that you should run away from it.. Always remember, you are not just your sole self.. you united with your partner and whatever it is that hurt you, could hurt him/her more..<br /><br />Be matured enough to face the consequences of your actions.. do everything to make it all work out.. be open to one another. about how you feel.. if a marriage would be saved by sacrificing a single-day-compensation.. then it would be all worth it.. pause for a while and listen..to what your partner wanted to convey..<br /><br /><em>Marriage doesn't assure you of a hundred percent happiness and satisfaction..</em><br /><br />...If after contemplating on the life you both shared, you end up feeling so restless and depressed.&nbsp;<br />...If instead of becoming someone better, you saw yourself like less of a person.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then maybe that's the time to think twice.. review your mistakes..and try to correct them. This time, make it right.. <br /><br />Not everyone had the same gift, and you have to realize that what&nbsp; you have received is something that's worth keeping, that's why&nbsp;we celebrate weddings.. that's why &nbsp;we have receptions.. that why we have wedding anniversaries.. it's one good thing that should be cherished for the rest of your lives..<br /><br /><strong><em>MARRIAGE...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><br /><br /><em>I've always believed in the sanctity of marriage.. and i deeply understand that it's something that's ought to be taken seriously.. I don't believe in divorces neither in annulments..&nbsp;<br /></em><br />i wanted to stay hopeful and optimistic.. i'm still like a little girl who believes in magics, happy endings and the the likes.. hehehe...&nbsp;<br /><br />Oddly, never did i imagine myself walking down the aisle.. it's not even in my&nbsp;'dreams'&nbsp; list.. Sometimes i would even question the significance of having a marriage.. i'm afraid of risking my life over something i'm not really sure that's of worth.. I already saw what marriage has to offer.. not all of it (*wink) but most of it.. It's just that i do sometimes feel that life is not leading me towards it.. (at saka bata pa talaga ko!!)&nbsp;&nbsp;or is it just because i'm not in a serious relationship.. (hahaha!)<br /><br /><br /><strong>from the way i see it.. marriage is more than just formality..<br />more than just signing of contracts and public declarations..<br />it's something that's so&nbsp;profound and difficult to seek..<br />and from my viewpoint,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no law ratified by this society can make it null and void...<br /></strong><br />that's what i wanna believe in..<br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Sa aking mga pinsan..&nbsp;<br />hehe.. =))<br />tsk tsk.. halos lahat kayo puro kakasalin..(hehe pde na palang kakasalin)<br />please see to it that you're getting (or wanna get) &nbsp;married for the right reasons..<br />sus.. matatanda na kayo.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><strong>and sa yo, whose marriage is on the rocks..<br />please take time to contemplate on your life sa ngayon..<br />everything you do and say reflects what&nbsp;is it&nbsp;that you prioritize..<br />salamat sa infos sa topic na to.. =))<br />at ingat ka jan..<br />fix your life ah? lol.<br /><br />love lots,&nbsp;<br />tita charo =))<br /></strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p><br />Read.<br /><br />This are the things closest to reality that i could ever write.<br /><br />Stop.<br /><br />I already gave up an important relationship.. and i must say this is the first time i gave up on my friends..<br />Believe me they really are important. But then how far should i go when everything seems to be destroyed?&nbsp;<br />compassion? trust? understanding?<br /><br />For weeks.. i have been an invisible person to most of them..&nbsp;<br />i can lie and say that i am never affected but then what do i get from lying.. all i have to do is to chill out.. shut up.. and work as if i am completely emotionless..<br /><br />For weeks, i have been having troubles even with my own self..<br />&nbsp;what if all the hurt&nbsp;were just&nbsp;brought by pride or fear of rejection?&nbsp;<br />Hell NO. for such a promising relationship i wouldn't care much about damn pride.&nbsp;<br />I've proven that a number of times..<br /><br />For weeks, i've never bother explaining..&nbsp;<br />what the hell am i suppose to say when i don't really know what the problem is all about?<br /><br />I tried assessing this situation and this is what i've got..<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friendship&nbsp;is&nbsp;a matter of COMPANIONSHIP as you express yourself to them. I would wanna be with someone who in&nbsp;the presence of all my flaws still appreciates the&nbsp;REAL HUMAN in me. I wanna be with a person who will not try to deceive me as i keep myself open to them. I won't&nbsp;keep a person who sees me&nbsp;DIFFERENT from the way that i really am..<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friendship, if i'm not mistaken, just like any relationship, is two-way. It involves commitment.. of trust and compassion..<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am never the kind of person who judges my friends. I&nbsp;was led to believe that you trust people especially when they don't&nbsp;show you anything that will make you&nbsp;withdraw such trust.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not the&nbsp;type who&nbsp; seems to be so distant. For me, the very purpose of friendship is for you to be able to share your life to someone else.. hope that they can learn something from you.. help them out in any way..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To whoever will react on these statements this is what i can say:&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never did i doubt you.. from the very beginning up to the end.. it was out of my purest intentions to help you out and give you time to think things through.. I can never deny the fact that things became so much unbearable for me.. but as unbearable as it is, i am not ashamed to admit that i DISCUSSED it WITH people who i think is CONCERNED, INVOLVED and DESERVED to know what&nbsp; the problem is. They are not&nbsp;MECHANICAL robots who will follow everything that we say.. They&nbsp;are not INSENSITIVE..&nbsp;They can FEEL more than how we expect them how to feel.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never did&nbsp;i judge you..i just gave them fair sides of the&nbsp;ISSUE that for&nbsp;them was&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;a&nbsp;NEW thing.. DO your homework.. make your researches complete before you draw conclusions about me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still trying to be the good old friend that i&nbsp;WAS to you.. i didn't bother to explain.. i am not&nbsp;in defense of &nbsp;anything especially to people who accuses me of invading something that is PRIVATE. How could something like that be INEVITABLE? In&nbsp;a little world such as ours?&nbsp;with the kind of people roaming around? &nbsp;People can sense and too bad i wasn't able to CONTROL how they think...&nbsp;I never lit a fire.. YOU and YOUR actions DID!!!! &nbsp;now I get all the blames. fair enough, isn't it? it is just because of my stupidity that i thought i can be your Superfriend who will rescue you from your darkest moments.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will remain being the good friend&nbsp;that i am &nbsp;to those people who bothers to know the&nbsp;EXTENT of what i d0 and what my reactions are.. to those people who manages to tell me 'fuck you and get lost'&nbsp; right on my face.. who never gave me insincere smiles.. who instead tells me what is it that i do wrong &nbsp;in order for me&nbsp;to understand..&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this situation, you looked like the oppressed.. for being so silent and containing your anger to your friends.. while showing how fucked up you are to the <strong>W</strong>hole <strong>W</strong>ide <strong>W</strong>orld! you only give other people ideas to talk about you.. to investigate on what it is that makes you feel resentful.SHOUT IT OUT&nbsp;to the world who doesn't care whether you put yourself in a shitty situation. You have just showed me&nbsp;the way to immaturely attack the situation. Tell your so-called FRIENDS.. who just behind your back laughs at your issues just because they can't comprehend.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just that i am completely tired of this. Me, just accepting anything.. all your blabbering and indirect resentments. I am not willing to suffer from the consequences of your actions. I warned you.. just because&nbsp;i care so much... that&nbsp;this can't be hidden for all of time. They believe what they perceive. They talk about what makes them tick..&nbsp;And it is clear injustice&nbsp;for my part if such things will be blamed upon me. I may&nbsp;be the one to know.. but isn't it possible for them to learn it in a way in which i don't have to teach? This is the reality &nbsp;in such a place filled with the ""WISEST"" people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;won't allow more things to be said about me.. by those people who just CLAIM to know who i am.&nbsp;&nbsp;..I&nbsp;tried to understand that all things were said&nbsp;due to this BLINDING moment. But they were&nbsp;too much for me to handle..&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;about HONESTY, talk about TRUST and talk about JUDGMENTS.. but not to ME!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, i am not the NICE person you will ever encounter.. but i know how to handle my friendships very well..&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among us, in this scene.. i was the one who didn't pay much attention. It is because..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i think before i act..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i know what to say..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what not to say..&nbsp;.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even to the person i kiss..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My whole point upon writing all these stuff is for you to leave it all alone.. we can't and personally,&nbsp;i won't make the friendship flourish again.. i am completely out of your beloved circle.. If being included means TELLING LIES and being&nbsp;SUPERFICIAL about myself.. just go on and rejoice in HEAVEN.. i'll be more happy living in&nbsp;HELL with my&nbsp;FANGS sticking out.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To you, who's claiming all the hurt. Just find peace within yourself. You actions tells me that you still have none.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

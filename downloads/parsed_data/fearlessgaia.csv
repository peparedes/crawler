i really cannot stand him 
he treats us like we are stupid yet we are SO much smarter than he is 
hes sooo has no control over anything what so ever 
unless it is paiges bladder, which he is convinced that he can control 
stupid man stupid stupid man 
we should get an A in that class just for putting up with him

i hate people who gossip ALOT or talk really REALLY bad trash about people 
especially when their girlfriends are in the room... i really hope that i heard wrong or stupid stupid people were not talking about who i think they were talking about 
ASSHOLES!!

"event","everything seems to upset me so much lately i rely on so many people way too much 
its like i sit by myself and feel so sad because i feel like all the people that love me are out having fun 
and im sitting here
alone 
but then the phone rings 
and everyone is somewhere and im the last to know 

i still smell you ... 

one of the people i love most in the world is also one of the most insecure 
talk to him sissy talk to him!!! you cant let him walk all over you like this you love him i know you do!

i finished my evil invitations but not without getting another paper cut 
this is just a sign that i should not graduate 
im not ready for this 
everyone is so excited 
but i hate change i cant deal with it 
i dont want the summer to come because its going to change everything 
im never going to be home 
everyone is going to be here without me i hate that more than i hate being away i would rather everyone leave me here alone to go to different places than leave everyone else here to have good times without me 
... i want to keep you in my pocket and never let you go

i hate this feeling, knowing that i cant live without you because i love you so much but having it hurt more when you cant be there for me when i need you 
next year you wont ever be there for me 
well be in different cities 
then how will i feel 
ill hate you 
and probably ruin our lives for doing something stupid 
then you wont trust me becauase you wont think i have faith

i love you so much i just cant do this 

... yea sorry so i went from not updating to rambling alot!"

Theres only one word on everyones mind: college!
i have yet to finish addressing my graduation invitations and they seem to not want to be addressed
as i was working on one today it decided to give me a HUGE paper cut
i gave up

i think that all the stuff i have to do for rush is adding up to be more than i had to do to get in to TCU anyway 
i have to have millions of pictures and they need my grades and all this shit 

i dont want to graduate 
i am looking forward to college yes 
but i have to leave so much behind 
all of my friends will still be here thats what makes it hard 
because they arent moving away too
leaving ryan will be one of the hardest things i will have to do 
it will be good for me though to learn to depend on myself rather than him all the time 
but i love him so much

thank god for kelly because i would be so scared if she werent going to be my roomate
and shell have chase so well both be missing our boys and having hopefully tons of fun and im guessing avoiding stephanie!

ok well i have to call ry now because he has ISS tomorrow and i wont see him
night all and good luck to those who have AP's"

"event","im completely 100 percent head over heels in love ... just thought i would let yall know 

i havent updated in forever ive been busy 

this weekend was fun 
friday night i went over to johns and hung out until forney got back from the basketball game then we headed up to floores country store to see roger creager 
IT WAS INCREDABLE that is the best concert i have ever been too
i had so much fun we were really close to the stage and he had so much energy and is such a great preformer it was a blast!!

then saturday i spent all day with erin we went to lunch and then to borders and then to TCBY
then i went over to ryans and we hung out and were going to go see the passion of the christ with erin but it was sold out and he was grounded so i ended up going to see club dread with just erin we had fun but it was the WORST movie i have ever seen 
it was like porno/comedy/horror really really bad 

then i went home and called ryan and we got in a fight because he was in a really bad mood

then today was fun ryan and i tried to go see the passion again but it was still sold out so we went over to forneys house with tracy and austin and watched my bosses daughter 
then we went to the club and ate 
there was a moon bounce outside the tavern and there were all these little kids and ryan and i and tracy and austin were picking out the kids that we wanted 

it was fun 
i love my friends!!! 
ahhh ROGER CREAGER WAS AWESOME

i really know why hes mad this time 
all the other times he didnt have a reason 
but he has a solid reason this time
i had to ask him to hug me before i left his house
and when he told me i love you back it looked really forced 
at least he kissed me 
i only think about myself all the time 
im so selfish especially when it comes to ryan 
im so spoiled that im used to getting everything i want and having everything go my way
im a spoiled brat and i love it but not anymore 
i take advantage of him so much
all he does is love me and do things for me 
i am so in love with him but im such a screw up
and by now im sounding like lori 
oh God lori ! 
we dont need to go there

"event","its kinda weird having two journals 
my ujournal (gaialovesyou)
is where i have been writing for like 2 or 3 years 
and im so used to it
but this is kinda better because my sisters dont read it and i can say what i want 
im going through this weird phase in my life and im finding out who my true friends are 
tracy amazes me more and more each day and so does erin 
tracy has started hanging out with austin again and totally apologized to ryan for freaking out on him about a week ago
shes been going through alot and i tried to give her space and now shes coming on strong again as my best friend 
and it makes me so happy that all i can do is be there for her all the time!!
kasey moved back today and im just waiting for it to make a huge dent in my little world that has become some what normal since she left 
erin and i have been talking alot more lately 
i really need to hang out with her 
i love her so much she is my sister 
the person that knows me the best out of everyone in the world 
she was seriously a part of my family for like 7 years 
she thinks that if we had stayed best friends that i wouldnt have found ryan but i dont entirely know if that is true 
i know that right now nothing could come between me and erin if we became friends again 
like seriously i wouldnt let anything come between us EVER
hmm well ryan is on the phone and he thinks that this is distracting me so im gonna go ill update more later!!"

"event","i dont know yet if i like this journal as much as my ujournal 
i guess i am just so used to the ujournal that this whole thing is out of place to me 
im very set in my ways and dont like to change things unless absolutely necessary
thats how it is 
but lately everything seems to be changing 
and adrienne was amazed that i actually had livejournal and didnt use it
my main reason for getting it was the be able to comment un annonymously on peoples journals 
also so i could have it all cool and personalized but i guess im not skilled and talented so i have no idea whatsoever how to make something really cool out of something that is actually in truth really boring 

i have a yearbook deadline coming up yeek!!!
and for all of you who want to be interested in jabberwocky we are going to have a meeting next week so COME !!
adrienne i will so keep you posted!
so tonight i kinda got really pissed because tracy amy and jackie came to campus life and i looked back after it was over and they were gone 
all tracy had to say was i felt really out of place 
well poo 
maybe you felt out of place because you have the devil re-encarnate with you *cough cough jackie cough cough*

kasey is moving back which means my life is going to be a living hell woo pee!!!! 
go me
oh well hopefully some great school will accept 
and there i will find the best friend that i have been missing my whole life 
and i will love her forever and she will be the maid of honor at my wedding and all thats cheesy stuff 

and to end it i just want to say screw pre cal homework can be done in my study hall of an english class"

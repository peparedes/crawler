through surreal strokes of music
young fiery psychedelic drugs looming
imagine drunk like harmony pieces
balancing out
smear my mad lively masterpiece 
glass shimmering
concrete wood
suffer the scream of an angel"

i don't even need the sun to warm my body
your gentle touch sends chills through me
allowing me to get lost in our love
bringing me back from my dream state
your breath sends that warm 
feeling of peace back through me
i love spending these summer days
doing absolutely nothing but sitting
with you under this big oak tree
and that wonderful feeling of 
knowing how much you truly love me"

Impossible to break through
The feeling os being trapped
no where to go, 
no where to turn
so many questions being asked
and not one answer presented
Impatient waiting
seconds slowly turn to minutes
minutes to hours
watching the smoke rise
as the time wastes away
no concrete guarantee
no way to break through---"

disturbing voices in the house
the smokey rays come from the window
no longer hearing the children's laughs
All I hear is the shattered glass
Breaking upon impact
tiny diamond-like pieces 
sail to every corner of the room
Oh what a mess! Must clean up!
the naiveness of the hurt
too blind to see the bruises
too deaf to hear the cries---"

Being with you is my ecstasy.

just wanting to touch you
But knowing I never will.
Your smile means so much
never showing your weakness
just wanting to speak to you
but too afraid to step up.
You're constantly on my mind
but knowing I'm never on yours.
What I would give 
to be in your warm embrace
even for just a night.
But instead, 
I watch you from a distance
wanting,
wishing...
You're everything I desire."

a beautiful painting
colors mix together
vibrant shades, many layers
You step back to admire the beauty
Something like this has to be perfect.
That's how I thought you were
until I stepped closer.
Like those paintings when you 
look closer, you can see the
tiny dots and little distortions.
Not perfect.
Not even close.
Thought you had everything figured out.
Too bad I didn't look close enough."

smoke surrounds you
twisting images
obnoxious sounds
eerie melodies chanting
from across the room
deceiving mirrors
wicked clowns and their disturbing laughter
The image is coming closer
sick red eyes
with a demented smirk
All the whispers,
the fake cries for help.
The colorful mushrooms
the little elves with painted faces 
running around in circles.
Everything becomes blurred.
swirling colors...
Just a nocturnal wonderland--"

the sky once bright blue

no more reason to hide.
the sound of geese honking by,
the distant memory of that painful lie.
the sun is slowly setting
night is just minutes away
the image is just like a
""stoner's paradise""
all nature has to offer within a touch
it gets colder out, the sky now completely dark.

no, just another January night."

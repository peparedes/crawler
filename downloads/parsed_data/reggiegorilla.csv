"event","okay. i'm done. i'm done with my journal. i will be updating it no more. all it does is piss people off and cause conflict and i'm sick of it. i can't say anything i fucking want to without it turning into a big deal. tom put the link to my fucking journal in his journal based on a note that jackee wrote to him a year ago, and didn't sign her name, because he was being an asshole. and melanie and i were kinda starting to be friends again and then all of a sudden she hates me again and i am so sick of this stupid soap opera drama bullshit. i'm fucking done. if i do another journal i'm only giving the name to katie and liz and mike because they seem to be the only ones who can not be jerks. it sucks because jackee and i were great friends but then i went to school and we just weren't the same after that. i miss her and i miss all of the stuff we used to do together becuase we had a great time. and i don't have any bad feelings towards her, i just don't understand her sometimes. but even if we did patch things up again, it wouldn't be the same because of her friendship with melanie and her relationship with nick. 2 people that hate me. so i'm going to go now. bye"

"event","tom~ nice try but i didn't leave that note

melanie~ i would really like for this to just stop. i didn't freaking do anything wrong except write in my journal that he was there. so please just leave me alone. you guys are happy and me and kerry are happy. we've all moved on so lets just leave it at that.

jackee~ i did call you back. i called your cell a bunch of times but there was no answer and i called you house and left a message with your sister. and i don't talk about you behind your back.

mike~ thank you

kid who didn't leave their name~ thank you also. i totally agree with what you said.

katie~ i had a blast too. i can't wait for you to come back again. it was so much fun.

okay, i did not make this journal to argue with people. so if you don't have something nice to say to me, leave me the hell alone. why waste your time leaving me shitty comments when you could be doing something productive with your time? so i'll say it one last time for those of you that didn't understand it the first time. please just leave me alone if you're going to be a jerk. thank you."

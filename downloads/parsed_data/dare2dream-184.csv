i think i'm going to sleep in tomorrow.
i am so lazy.
movie night is really fun.
but that movie was really disturbing and bothered me for some reason.
cheerleading is almost over. NOVEMBER. one more month.
i hope this competition thing ends early on saturday. or else i'll be greatly dissappointed.
i got out of that stupid school ticket. gay.
i really want to go to disney world. i <b> need </b> to go to disney world.
my new phone finally came.
medieval times was fun. even though our knight lost. 
that's right, skip homecoming and go eat somewhere with just your hands.
and then go do a corn maze 45 min. away, but the stars are so beautiful out there that it doesn't matter.
why do i feel like crying? i hate being emotional.
what am i going to do next year?. i'm so scared.
i just can't see myself living on my own. it kind of sucks.
i miss my lacie so much. i got all the leaves off and then i just sat and cried. my poor poor baby.
baylie is cute, but she doesn't love me."

and i do not want to go back.
this summer has been amazing.

i jumped off the bridge.
it was so fun. and scary. 
and i think everyone alive should do something they'd never think they'd do.
something that makes them feel alive.
and prove that fear is nothing.

i bowl so much that you'd think i'm actually good at it.
oh no. i suck.

lindsey comes home tomorrow.
two months is wayyy too long.
i am sooooo excited to see herrrrrrrr!!!!!!

i really love my mom. so much.
and sometimes i don't think she knows how much i do.
and i wish that i could show her another way then just saying it.
she lets the littlest things bother her. and she shouldn't.

sometimes i don't know why i bother.
why do i try? honestly.
i don't even know who i'm trying to impress anymore.
i was doing so good.
and thennn that happens.

myspace has taken over. 
haha. 
that's all i ever do now/ 
but it's broken. :( 

summer has been amazing. 
i went to disney world. 
with laura. 
and that was oh so much fun. 
we own tower of terror. yup. 
and i'm a little upset that school is starting back in less than a month. 
because i'm not ready for it. 
senior year. that is crazy. 
summer has gone by way too fast.&nbsp;
two weeks. and then lindsey is home. i have missed her so much. it's crazy.
i really like life. and friends. and family.&nbsp;and summer. and disney world. and smiling. and laughing. and eating.&nbsp; and music. and driving. and sunny weather. and just everything. 
i want to go on another vacation. 
but i'm not and that breaks my heart. 
so basically cheerleading is killing me. 
and i try so hard. to be the best i can be. 
but it is not working. and i hate that. 
i cry over cheerleading. 
how stupid is that? 
i need to get tan. 
i love allison and lisa. they are my favorites. 
we just pick up right where we left off. 
and i love that. 
i don't like change. it messes with me. 
i don't know what i want to do with my life....that is the scariest thing in the world. 
i don't mind spending days at my house. like the other night for instance, i did not want to go out, so i didn't. and it was lovely.&nbsp; 
but then there are other nights, where i really really want to get out of this house...and not be anywhere near it...those nights suck. because those are the nights where i really want someone to call and no one does. it's kind of sad. 
why can't i stop listening to this song?&nbsp; 
i'm happy. 
alright. that's a bunch of nothingness. but you like it. :)"

i walked into language arts today and i saw the counclers and i just wanted them to be like, there was just a scare he's alright now. 
but it wasn't like that.
and i knew it wasnt going to be like that.
he's gone.
and i just don't think it is fair at all.
he did not deserve it.
he was probably one of the most amazing people i have EVER met.
he was so nice to every single person. 
he was just an over-all great guy.

everyone's face at school today was the same expression.
he's made an impact on everyone basically.
he will live on forever in us.
pray for the Boston family, they need us most now.

"event","so we went to new york city today. (not yesterday like i thought.) oh my gosh i loved it there.
 we went to ground zero and it was so weird just trying to think of what it felt like on that day and all the chaos that was going on. it's hard to believe that it happened and it was almost four years ago, it still feels like just yesterday. there was a little memorial thing on the fence with all this information about 9/11, seeing all those names made me really sad..all those poor families they belonged to, it's still hard to believe that it happened. it had a little timeline thing on the fence with the times the planes took off and everything... idk i just tried to imagine what it was like there that day. 
and we went to battery park... saw the statue of liberty.  

i thought it was so cool walking past the subways and feeling the ground shake when a subway was under it. underground traveling. 

it was like a whole other world there. nothing like anywhere i have ever been before. when we were sitting in the traffic i looked outside at all the different people and thinking about how different their lifestyles are... there was a lady buying fruit and my mom and i were talking about her, thinking about how she lives and wondering where she goes home to and what she goes home to.. idk..it was cool looking at all the different people there.  

my dad was so happy to be there. it was like he was home. you could see the happiness in his eyes and you just tell that all these memories were running back to him. he told me he loved living there and there was something different to do there everyday. i think it would be amazing to live there.

i loved how it was so busy there. all the traffic. all the people walking on the sidewalks. it was truly fascinating.

i just had to breathe and take it all in.

i really don't understand how people hate it there. i really don't. people were not mean to us. we never got honked at. what is there to hate about it? i don't know.
i don't want to come home."

i've been in the weirdest of moods lately.
i love anna. like for real. that girl is amazing. and so easy to talk to.

i've been writing a lot lately. and it feels amazing. i love to write. even if i'm not that good at it. it's such an awesome way to feel accomplished and to let everything out. 

i've cried so much this week. about everything. every little thing is bothering me. my mom. people. friends. cheerleading. myself. life in general. 

i fucking hate being ignored. 
i feel like i am always being ignored by people and it's starting to really bother me.
i know i don't always say the right things but you could at least listen to me. i have things that i want to say that are important to me that i want people to hear and when they just block me out i get so upset. but i don't say anything. i just let it go.

i want to have my own get-a-way place just for me. i want to get in the car and just drive. i want to go to a drive-in movie. i want to race the wind. i want to fly a kite. i want to play on a playground. i want to swing. i want to run through the rain. i want to lay out in the middle of the road and just stare up into the sky and just think. i want to chase fireflies. i want to reach the stars. i want to have a water balloon fight. i want to act like a little kid. i want to sing my lungs out. i want to talk to my sister. i want to do everything. i want to do the impossible.
i want to make the most out of this summer.

it just use to come so easy.
it's different when you get older.
i just expected everything to fall into place.
and it hasn't.
i set expectations and they can't be reached.
it's retarted.
and then i get mad at myself and i cry and i feel sorry for myself.
but i shouldn't. because the world doesn't revolve around me.
it revolves around everyone. and i just don't know, all i would do was cry and sleep. i wasn't depressed. i was just sad. i saw what other people had and i wanted it but i couldn't get it because i didn't make any effort. i was stupid. i wanted other people to try, i was lazy i guess. but i hope things are different this summer. i will try i promise."

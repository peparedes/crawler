yesterday was amazing.  it was wonderful and beautiful and everything i hoped it would be.  

graduation was good.  it wasn't as long and boring and lame as i expected.  the speeches were good.  sitting next to friends thanks to the magic of the alphabet was good.  putting on my ridiculously large sunglasses and being silly was good.  it was the closing of a very very huge chapter of my life.  

last night, another chapter was opened.  my band, derby, had our first show at the masquerade.  it was the most fun i have probably ever had.  mostly everyone i care about came out to support us.  it made me feel so loved to see so many familiar faces looking back at me as i looked out from the stage.  i'm so grateful and thankful for all of you.  

thank you for coming out and seeing us play.  you guys mean the world to me.  without you, last night would not have been 1/10 as special as it was."

the band is doing really well...we are called DERBY for all of you inquiring minds out there.  we are recording a demo over spring break and all that good stuff....getting a press kit together to give to different booking people.  

we have a show booked for June 6 at Smith's Olde Bar with Red Letter Agent and Pageant.  It's 21+ so everyone who isn't 21 needs to get a fake ID. But that's a long time away anyways.  We plan to start playing in may.  

things are going really well, but i'm ready to graduate high school and move on.  it'll happen soon.

who wants to tell me how to make things bigger and bold and put pictures etc in here???  do you just use HTML?  help.

ok i'm out like a fat kid in dodge ball....or should i say a PHAT kid in pimped out gangsta ball."

sunday i had a pretty bad fever...it got up to 104.something.  no puking though...that was nice.  i just slept and watched t.v. and fell asleep watching t.v., thus sleeping more.  mom and dad took good care of me...that was nice.

today is monday.  i didn't go to school.  i still feel pretty crappy.  i'm glad i didn't have to go to school though.  i'm tired of being sick.  i just want to be over all this.

the weekend wasn't too good.  ask me about it if you want me to elaborate and, depending on who you are and what mood i'm in, i might tell you.  but it has all turned out ok.  and that's all you need to know anyways.  

i went to the movies alone on monday night and saw Lost In Translation.  it was my first time ever going to the movie theater by myself and i really enjoyed it.  a good way to clear my mind and have some good alone time.  and i don't have to worry about what the person/people i'm with are thinking of the movie.  i always end up doing that...wondering if other people are liking the movie i'm watching.  i even found myself on monday wondering if the couple in front of me were liking the movie okay.  i didn't even know them.

i loved Lost In Translation, by the way.  that movie kept a smile on my face the whole time.  how many movies do you know that can do that?  it was pretty sad though.  i love movies that can be funny and sad at the same time.  joyful and heartbreaking.  

sophia coppola was so good in this film at saying SO MUCH with few words.  her writing was fantastic and the cinematography was so beautiful...it fit the mood of the movie perfectly.  i love it when style and story go together so seamlessly.

the DVD came out today.  i'll definitely buy it when i get enough money together.  

my band is going to start practicing more often.  we don't have a name, but we have songs.  and we have good songs.  and they are more important than a name right now.  i'm really excited that all this is coming together right now.  we just need to get our crap together and so we can start playing some shows. and we need another guitar player.  a demo is next on the to-do list however.  i can play both guitar parts on it, and i know a ton of people who would fill in at shows for now.

i'll be sure to burn a copy for all of you when it gets done.  it won't be anything fancy, but you guys can get an idea.

it's 12.20.  i should probably go to sleep.  i borrowed the Godfather boxed set from one of my friends.  he wants it back this Sunday, and i still need to watch the 2nd and 3rd movies.  the first one was fantastic.

and my satire movie is due monday.  and i have to shoot it and edit it, and it's not even really written.  i'm kind of worried about that.

i started reading slaughterhouse five today.  i think i'm going to like it.  

this is so stream of consciousness.  goodnight.

feel free to leave a comment with a band name suggestion.  it'll be fun!"

"event","hey.  it's been a while.  life has been pretty good lately.  

i probably should have died yesterday in a car wreck but i didn't.  that's good.  i was driving down 85 in the morning in the fast lane and i hydroplaned like a mother and lost complete control of my car.  I slid across 4 lanes and turned a complete 180, thus finding myself staring directly into the headlights of approaching traffic, ready to be slammed head on and become a lifeless body lying on the pavement.  thank God the people in those cars were PAYING ATTENTION and were able to swerve before making me into a corpse.  I waited for traffic to clear and turned around and continued on my journey to church.  

i was terrified and drove the rest of the way at about 45 miles an hour.  i consider myself very fortunate to not have even wrecked my (mom's) car.  had i slid to the left i would have hit that big concrete wall = dead.  had there been a car in ANY of the 4 lanes i would have slammed into them = me and/or whoever else is in the other car dead.  so i am very thankful and feel very blessed that none of these worst case scenarios occurred.

as i stared into those headlights coming at me i really came to grips with the fact that it could be the end.  and it was peaceful.  for that split second, i wasn't scared.  i knew that if that car was going to hit me that i couldn't do anything to stop it.  i could only trust God.  That's how i want to live my life all of the time.

so where do i go from there??"

"event","hello friends and comrades.  any plans for new years eve??

well i have plans! and so do you - you just don't know it yet. this is where i use my livejournal for shameless self promotion.

i am playing a little rock show downtown at trinity vineyard church.  that's right - matt mcdaniel is playing a show.  and i expect everyone that claims to be my friend to be there.  i don't care if you are out ot town in alaska or wherever.  you are going to come see me play.

other bands include pageant, red letter agent (acoustic), and meghan coffee.  i don't have to tell you twice that it's going to be good.  pageant and red letter agent have both been regularly played on 99x's show, ""sunday school"", which is about the only time 99x plays decent music.  

so, yeah.  the extravaganza starts at 8.30 on the 31st (new years eve) and it should rock on into the new year (which might be past curfew for some of you kids).  i am playing first, at 8.30 SHARP.  SO DON'T BE LATE!

directions to trinity, where you can witness the indie rock wonder that is matt mcdaniel:

From the Duluth area, take 85 South.  Exit at Techwood/10th Street/14th Street.  Turn RIGHT onto 14th street.  This road will go on for a few miles, and then it dead ends into Howell Mill Road.  Take a right onto Howell Mill. At the next light, take a left onto Huff Rd. Go approx. 3/4 mi and turn right onto Ellsworth Industrial Blvd. Trinity is the second building on the left. There may or may not be a sign by then, so look for lights and people! 


so yeah.  that's that.  come if you can.  i would really appreciate it.  it's going to be fun.  

much love,
matt"

Finals were good today.  I made an 86 on English, which I needed.  And psychology was a joke.  I should have taken AP.  

So i just wrote a new song in about 10 minutes and i love it. Yesterday I felt so uncreative and crappy; but today i walked in from school, grabbed my guitar, and wrote a song that i actually like.  I really love it when that happens.  It's so beautiful."

it's going to be good though.  time to relax and hang out with the people i love. time away from school and mrs. weakley and all the rest of that crap i don't wish to mention because it might ruin the rest of my night.  it's going to be great.

i'm ready for lord of the rings to come out.  i'm ready for bright eyes to record a new album and play in atlanta.  i'm ready to be in college but i'm not ready to go there.  i want to be automatically settled in at a great school and surrounded by tons of great friends who REALLY know me and care about me.  It's the horrible transition period that terrifies me to the DEPTHS OF MY SOUL!!  The time when i arrive at the college of my choice (yet to be chosen) and i'm alone and lonely (they are different, mind you).  The possibility of being completely alone scares me so much.  I know that is an unrealistic fear...but it is a fear nevertheless.

i want to be inspired.  i want my creative well to spring back to life.  i want something to write about that is so insanely important to me that if i don't say it i will explode.  but i have nothing to say that is that pressing to me.  i guess it happens from time to time.  

speaking of creative wells, i think mine has run dry for this entry.  looking over this, i think it is my first cynicaltoungeincheeksarcasm-free entry.  i guess that speaks for something."

"event","Hello.  It's been a while.  I have been extremely busy.  

Let's see...where should we start. 

Well, I played at the Lit Mag thing on friday and that was pretty fun...good to hang out with people I don't get to see much outside of prison...i mean school.  But it went pretty well and thanks to all who came out to hear me play.

That night I almost died in a car accident.  I was going a wee bit too fast on that road off of North Berkley Lake with the railroad tracks on it, and it was really wet.  Thus i lost control of my car and slammed into the curb and probably should have flown into the woods, but for some reason i found myself on the road again.  Nothing is wrong with my car except my steering wheel is way out of alignment.  It needs to be way to the left to go straight.  It was pretty scary...ask kara berry. she was sitting next to me.

later that night i watched Bottlerocket with kk and derek/mike.  When Mr. Prall left Mr. Mooney showed up.  We drank excessive amounts of coffee and insanity ensued.

saturday was insane.  I woke up at like 11 and spent 4 hours writing my paper for Mossler.  That really sucked.  right after i finished that i went to derek's to finish shooting MacDeath.  it was stressful but fun to hang out with him and brittany.  she's great.  we got the movie done and it looks amazing.  then we hung out for a while and watched the first half of american history x.  that movie never ceases to depress and inspire me.  but i only got halfway through...before the inspiration kicked in.  so i was just depressed.

today i am happy.  the movie is done and was super fun to make.  the paper is done and was not fun at all to write.  pressure is off for the most part.  i have been sleep deprived all weekend so i am feeling very tired. 

I am trying to finish a few of the hundreds of songs i have half written.  It's coming together.  

that's about it.  i just realized how boring all of that was to you guys.  sorry for wasting your time."

so tonight i am going to start painting our new church building.  it used to be a recording studio that was owned by Kansas and then Sting and then the amazing Puff Daddy...or should i say P. Diddy.  haha.  that should be fun though.

i have to get my grades up.  they are terrible.  i have c's in math and english.  it's just cause i never do my homework.  but that has changed...hopefully. and i have a big paper for mossler due monday. ughh.

and i'm tired of all this drama crap.  it's over.  it has been played out and it's just silly.  so let's just all try to get along!

so in conclusion, COFFEEHOUSE FRIDAY DECEMBER 5th 3:00 PM at BORDERS BOOKS BY GWINNETT PLACE MALL.  COME.

much love for all."

i read his last interview, which is available here: http://www.undertheradarmag.com/es.html

it basically talks about how he was getting his life together.  things were finally looking up.  he had gotten through his struggle with drug addiction.  elliott had a new lease on life and was finishing his 6th album.  then suddenly he stabbed himself in the heart.  sober, not on any drug - one stab to the heart. and then it was over."

"event","happy thanksgiving everyone.  my whole entire family came over today, which is normally a very stressful and awkward time for me.  however, this year it was pretty cool.  it was good to spend time with my cousins and aunts and uncles and connect with them on a deeper level that the normal superficial ""how are you""s and etc.  

i am so cynical.  i judge everything i see around me, and sometimes i really think it keeps me from enjoying life.  in always being angry about injustice or how stupid people are or whatever, it can just keep me in this horrible depressed mood.  i don't want to dwell on negativity all the time.  

however, there is a balance.  i don't want to be blindly happy all of the time, ignoring all the things wrong with the world and walking around with a dumb smile on my face.  things need to upset us.  if we don't get pissed off about the terrible things in this world, then they will never change.

so i guess there is a healthy balance somewhere.  i just wish i could find it."

tonight was pretty cool.  me and derek watched Royal Tenenbaums, chelsea was supposed to watch it with us but she was super late because she was hanging out with college.  stupid college.  but she watched the last half of the movie and liked it, then we reminisced about the old elementary and middle school days for a while.

Tenenbaums is such a beautiful movie.  put me in a good mood.

speaking of amazing movies, i watched Magnolia last night with my parents. that movie gets me every time.  it is so amazing.  p.t. anderson is a genius.

i need to figure out that thing where i can tell you guys what music and mood i am in.  that is very cool.

i enjoy this little virtual fist-fight going on in the last thread.  it is nice to get such a good response.  controversy is a beautiful thing.  keeps life interesting.  maybe someone will dislike Magnolia and start cussing me out on this thread or something.  that would be fun."

Lately school has just been a blur, I've been trying to do all my work and trying to get good grades on what I decided to do and hopefully once report cards come out ma will be proud.

My life outside of school has blown, there's never anything to do. I go out but it seems like I shouldn't. Because everytime I leave my house theres shit to do. oh well. I always try and make the best of it, no matter what the circumstance, I end up having some what fun.

So Jarvis kicked a chinese girl in the ass because he thought it was me bending down at my locker. Little did he know I was probs on my way to class nd not at my locker..haha

One of my good friends is angry with me, but its not my fault she lied, and its not my fault she acted like a straight bitch for no reason. Its just not my fault. Do you think she should take into consideration that him not trusting her makes sense? MAYBZ

Ive gone to a few b-ball games, and we SUCK! The only good part about it is the sick dance team. Our cheerleaders blow,nd our players obviously stink!

Im also gettin even more disgusted as days pass. It makes me fucking sick to my stomach but hey who am I to judge right? Hopefully things will soon change if not, I guess it was for the best right? 

So this weekend was wicked gay...The phone call on Friday night and the mini snowball fight last night was prob the most enjoyable. As for school tomorrow deffinetly not looking foward to it, but I guess I have no choice.

It's crazy how its just about been a year. It seems like just yesterday I was at his house in his living room listening to him tell me how much he wanted me to take a little peek, or how just 4 years ago we were all at dannys having fires in his back yard. It's amazing how time goes by so quickly. R.I.P Rory! I love and miss you so much!"

"event","Well Thursday was Amanda G's Bday!...The student/faculty b-ball game was pretty sikk, a few delays during it but w/e. Joce came to my house after and Moe came to get us at 6. We hit up the game but it got cancelled because it wasn't safe?..Alysse met us there and then we all left and went to Wendys with everyone. Me and Jocelyn decided its not rainin that hard so lets stand outside and mingle with people instead of sitting here like idiots. We got soaking wet but it didn't seem to bother us. I saw Paulson who I haven't seen in a while, caught up with and smoked with him Danny nd Geradi. Lewis wants to molest me and Oday saw my boob. Moe brought me home for 11 and pretty much went to bed because I had to get up for my dads house Christmas Eve.

Around 2 my dad came to get me and we hit up the mall because we hadda get last minute gifts. Headed to Connecticut nd chilled. Ordered pizza and opened gifts. I got a cell phone! a digital camera, a ring, cloths, gift certificates, and little things here and there. After opening presents we went to Mandi's dads house and hung out with her family for a bit. Went back to my dads and ate some more food and watched some Tv. My dad brought me and andrea home arounnd 1.

Christmas was pretty sikk...Woke up opened presents. I got a whole new bed set, cloths, gift cards, jewlery and a few other things. Ate a huge dinner just the 3 of and then went to my aunts house for dessert. I didn't get home until 930 and I watched a movie and went to bed. 

I had plans with Jarvis today to blaze. At about 130 him and Pat came to get me and then we got Matt. Got some weed,ate some food, and saw some movies. We walked into the last 20 minutes of Lemony Snickets, which I had already seen with Jocelyn the other night, so that ended and we snuck into Meet the Fockers. Funny ass movie but the first one was better. Whats up with the snow man? The roads are complete shit so we all went home. Now im here for the night which blows balls.

Not sure what the fuck Im doing tomorrow. I want to go to the mall but who knows if that will happen.

Hope everyone had a nice Christmas!

Thursday-
I hung out with Jarvis Jocelyn Pedone nd Danny, we matched eachother nd then decided to pop by Price Choppers. haha that was deffinetly a funny little trip. i think geradi may not be all that happy with me but hey it was just got laughs. Pedone brought me home around 9 and I pretty much just went to bed. 

Friday-
Me jarvis nd pat left after lunch and decided to come to my house. Chilled here and smoked, then left to go bak to school and get Andy and Joce. Dropped Pat off, went to Wendys then to the bank to cash Jocelyns check, brought Andy home and then he dropped us off at my house. We thought all day that we were gonna go out with Pedone to smoke and chill but ahh plans got fuked over because of my bitch sister..Me and jocelyn however stayed in and sat on our asses. She slept over and then at 1030  in the morning my mom brought her home so she could go to work. 

Saturday-
I cleaned my room and did my laundry, got ready and headed out with Amanda Andrea and Freddy. Drove around for a little, smoked and then came here. It was deffinetly a night I spent laughing my ass off. Us 4 haven't hung out in so long and probably never will so it was a straight night.

Sunday-
There were family plans to go to my aunts house with my dad but of course no one in my family is ever on time for anything so we ended up not going. How family like. My dad and Mandi ended up picking just me up at around 5 and we headed to O'Connors for dinner. I had the wonderful steak and potatoes. yummm...came home and murf picked me up to smoke that blunt that we have been planning on smoking. Bothered Johnny at work and then got Devin nd Danny. Hung out with them and went back to Murfs. Margo is a little crazy. Putting the icecles on the christmas tree? haha Johnny came over and then we left because I had to go home. I came home to an empty house, that I had all to myself all night long. I could have partied but I went to bed instead.

Monday/TODAY-
Today was our first snow day of the year! I woke up at 9 and enjoyed the rest of the day. Watched some Dawsons Creek, ate some food, talked on the phone and looked at a bunch of shit from elementary school. I found a picture of Joe Perez and Richie when they were in the 2nd grade. I was laughing my ass off, they've changed quite a bit. It was funny to look back on the weird shit that happend at Greendale. As of now I have to do this project for History that I was supposed to do last week.

Chilled in eds car and watched The Grinch dvd. My mom came to get us at like 11 and brought her home and then dropped me off nd headed out. 

Tomorrow Im going to my dads to paint his new house and just hang out with him and Mandi for the day instead of doing a whole lot of nothing as usual..Its gonna suck because I wont be able to have a butt until I get home from connecticut...deffinetly dreading it.

"event","Well for the past week I have been grounded because of drinking...

I've gone to school and come home everyday and taken naps, quite the interesting week if you ask me. Tuesday Jocelyn came over after school and went to the mall with my sister because I of course could not go. Wednesday me her and jarvis left after 5th period and came to my house. Talked and smoked some butts, me and jarvis were going to go back but I decided not to and he however went back. Moe picked up Jocelyn to run some errands. Joce came back and showed me a hamster that she had gotten at the pet store that is being kept at andys because jocelyn doesn't even know if she can keep it..haha Frite Rupert Wilbur Snicklefritz Payne, such a sick name. I'd like to add that he shit about 7 times all over me. gross. but funny. I decided, we actually I was made, to not go to school today. I went somewhere, and took a nap watched Wrong Turn and The Ring. Got a phone call at like 930 and was told my dad was planning on dismissing me...not cool so I had no choice but to tell him I didn't go, that I skipped. He laughed and told me to be home for 2 so I could see him. So I was, we hit up Dunkins and then Sams Club to bring my camera there. I came home and took another nap, and here I am.

I hate cunts who involve themselves in my business. My life has absolutly nothing to do with theirs and I would appreciate it if they minded there business. I also dont exagerate shit and then presume to tell my friends and make a big deal of something that didn't concern either of them. Basically people suck and thats the main reason I hate girls. They talk so much shit and start to much drama its hard for them to keep up with. There all a bunch of fakes who need to get a grip. This however has nothing to do with the few girls I actually like.

I've finally realized I want you to die. Now I understand this whole thing I following along with, your a piece of shit and I hope you know that.

"event","Well after my nice day home from school last Monday..I ended up going out with Jarvis nd Joce tuesday night smoked a blunt nd just chilled. We probs had the weirdest conversation ever..it was deffinetly a laughing matter. Wednesday went to school came home nd smoked with Andrea. Thursday was Jocelyns birthday, her jarvis nd andy came to get me nd then we picked up Nikki...Joce Jarvis nd Nikki smoked a blunt in the Wendys parkin lot while we all watched Glen have his -moment-...Im deffinetly having second thoughts about that boy. He kicked Andy out of the front seat so Andy hadda hop in the back with us...then they proceeded to fight...interesting night. Halvey Malki nd Fran were also there but they just talked to eachother. I came home at about 9ish that night. Friday was a while different story. That was Jocelyns Birthday celebration. Me nd her got dismissed at noon and got her check nd shit nd then came to my house. I got ready nd did shit for my mom while she started to drink at 230! By the time Andy nd Jarvis came over at like 430ish she was already bent. We hung out for a bit nd started to drink. When we left we took my sister with us because her and Jarvis were going to go half on gram..hit up BK smoked with them 2 and got some serious battle wounds. I fought both Andy and Jarvis..they kinda beat me up though...Jocelyn nd Andy went at it for like 45 minutes...there was yelling and crying..and laughing...it was nuts..Moe came down and us 3 girls hopped in her van went to get Bobby, went bak to Bk for a bit nd then headed to X nd Erickas house. Too  many insane things went on..every1 was either drunk and high or just drunk. Amanda McGrath was there who I haven't hung out with in forever so I ended up sleepin at her house. Joce left at about 1130 which was a process because it took us like 20 minutes just to get her in the car. But she made it home safely and didn't even get in trouble. Once Ange dropped us off at the house we ate food nd went to bed. Woke up the next morning and smoked. Made french toast kinda got fixed up a bit nd came home.

I wasn't even home for like an hour nd I got a call from my mom telling me I was grounded...cunt...She knew I was drinkin..even though I didn't come home? yah shes deffinetly gay. Well yeah she found the empty beer can in my trash but it wasn't even mine...so she assumed I was drunk..although I was but w/e. So until Saturday I cant go out..fuking WAK..I guess I will just have to party Saturday..whatever. I got another call from my dad...It was his birthday Friday and he headed to a local bar down the street from where he lives..and got stabbed by a fukin hill billy. Quite the long story but hes fine now. 

Today is Tonys birthday and I cant even hang out with him because my mom is a bitch. We got into a huge fight this morning and she told me she doesn't give a fuck about me or my sister anymore so we can shuv chrismas up our ass and spend it with my dad because shes ""done""...shes so dumb sometimes I cant stand it.

Im really upset with what was said Friday night although it made me pretty fuckin happy, nothing is going to happen because shit is in the way...its good to know someones true feelings though. I also slept on the bed where many memories were made Friday night at mandas house..haha many summer memories..

I probably wont be updating for a while because I will have nothing to say...peace 1"

Played some drinking games nd listened to some jams. Ben took us back to Amandas nd her mom wasn't home so we were gona chill at her house but Justin wouldn't let us in so we headed back to Bens. I went to Mcds with John nd Darrel and ate of course, which almost made me sick...I got thrown around by the 2 boys to see if they could bench press me...didn't work...then at 1 we went back to Amandas to find out her older brother was there and had told her mom we weren't there. I was supposed to sleep there but her mom made me go home so Rob brought me home at about 2 in the morning. It wasn't as bad of a night as I thought it was going to be but it was a tad boring for me btw the hours of 11 and 1...no comment. I however am quite proud at a goal I accomplished...

Sunday was a bummy day, I watched TV did some laundry and cleaned my room. I couldn't fall asleep to save my life last night so I decided to play hookie. Stayed home from school and got some sleep in. I got a pack of butts that Ive been waiting to smoke but cant until my mom heads to bed..jeeze..

School tomorrow, woohoo! Joce is coming over and then Im pretty sure were gonna chill with Jarvis, smoke and possibly hit up the movies. Then I will come home nd watch my fav. shows. 

As for the moment Im going to wrap Jocelyns present, well actaully throw it in a gift bag with some tissue paper and call it a night.

Since the last entry not a hell of alot went on. Semi was pretty sik but afterwards blew nutsack. Ive hung around with Freddy a few times which was surprising because after the whole fight btw him nd Jarvis he neglected to talk to me. Ive also done something I never thought I would a few times, which has come to a stop because I cant stand to see myself do that any longer. I've had no sexual encounters which blows...well hey there was always 25seconds, mayb next time. Other than that its been a pretty boring month.

I got my report card the other day which was a HUGE disappointment...I go from A's and B's to D's and F's. Im improving! ha thats a joke. School is fukin gay man...I also bought a pack of butts on Thursday and accidentally washed them with my cloths. How awesome is that? 

Friday after school I went with Jarvis Andy nd Joce so she could get her check and cash it. After that we hit up Getty nd got some buy one get ones. Came home nd chilled for some hours. Moe came over after dinner with her family and then we went to pick up Andy nd Jarvis. Came back to my casa and waited for Jim Stanton Pat Vay nd Tony to get here. Me Andy nd Moe were the only straight ones, everyone else was either blasted out of their minds or drunk. Jim nd them went home and us 5 watched Johnny Tsunami, sikk as movie. Jocelyn gave us all her drunk speech nd then me nd her had our ""woman to woman"" talk and cried? We both had our share of disappointments last night. Moe brought Andy home or to Caitie's Im not quite sure, then she came back here. We hung out a little while longer until Moe Joce and Jarvis left. I however stayed here and cleaned up a bit.

Today I didnt wake up until 1130, well actually like 10 but I didn't see the need to get out of bed. Did shit all day and here I am. Its fukin gross outside and nothing to do so I felt the need to stay in. Ive gotten nothing done, as if I really have anything to do. I can tell you one thing, Im bored out of my fukin mind.

Ive realized that life is full of nothing but disappointments and you cant truely count one any one person, and Every good thing in life comes to an end sooner or later. I look foward to nothing everday, I wake up and wonder so many things at once my mind overflows with thoughts. I cant stand 2-faced people or people who break promises, or for that matter people who break your heart. Im so sick of all the bullshit that goes on. Everyone really needs to wake the fuck up and realize whats happend. People are just to busy being caught up in their own drama to realize what actually matters. Who gives a shit about the he said she said crap, or all the other bullshit that is so concerning. Its so childish it makes me sick. I really miss when every one was so close, there weren't 8 groups of people who exclude themselves from every1 else. It used to be everyone hanging out and there weren't shit talkers running around saying something about so nd so. Now every one has gone their seperate ways and people wonder why. 

I dont care who thinks what of this entry, its been a while since I even updated and thats what I had to say. 

A 2-day school week and then Turkey Day..yahhh I cant wait to shuv my face with food until I have to un-button my pants. I love it!...peace 1"

Thursday Joce came over after school, when doesn't she? haha Jarvis came to get us because his game was cancelled and we smoked a nice fat blunt. We caught up on the past 2 weeks because we've gone our seperate ways and dont chill with the fucker ne more. Let me just say I was so fukin high I couldn't believe it...nd how about the little boy peeing right next to us nd shootin us with his fingers? hehe

Friday went to the mall after school so Joce could get shoes for her dress and we ran into Sheena Joe and Tyler, hes getting so big. Shes finally coming back to school to finish up her senior year which is sikk...We were gonna hit the game up but decided not to because it was freezing out. We ended up walkin down to Stoleys house to chill with him Perez nd Johnny Grey. Hes a funny little fucker. We chilled in ""mantown"" and were the first girls to be in it, things got out of hand and well lets just say another replay of 6/11. Johnny brought me home around 11ish and I basically just went to bed.

Saturday stayed home all day long and waited for Joce to get outta work. She came here and we were supposed to go to Stoleys again to watch the first game of the World Series but my mom ended up going out at about 9 and we got a bottle of Soco. Tony C came over and we just chilled. Me and Jocelyn got a bit out of hand. A liter of soco finished by us 2 isn't to good. All I know is that alot of shit if fucked up all because of that one night, and neither of us have any idea on how it all happend. One minute were havin drunk talks and being our crazy selves to the next crying and not knowing what to do. 

Woke up at 830 in the morning and puked my brains out, ikkk. Went back to bed until 11 and went to Jocelyns dads for the day. Joce on the other hand was hanging alot worse than myself..puking about every half hour, uhh it was a nightmare. I came home at about 730 and here I am. The 2nd game of the World Series is on, as of now the score is Red Sox 2 St.Louis 0...yahhhh were sikk!! Off to watch the rest of the game and write an essay.

GOSH came home, watched the game that we won YEAHH and hit the sack.

Thursday, went to school, came home and at about 8ish Jarvis came to get me with Joce and we went nd got Matt nd Pat. Went down to Kendrik nd smoked while Pat finished up his Coronas. It got a bit over whelming sitting in the back with those 2. Drove around, stopped at bk for a bit and some how ended up on Devins corner with basically everyone you can think of. Caitie and the girls played ass nd tities which got some ppl to brake it down. Wasnt in the best of moods that night, but something made me laugh and it was straight afta that. Me nd Joce came here at about 11ish, ate some food and watched Tv. For some odd reason I started out on the chair and ended up on the floor curled up at about 2am?? I hav no idea how that happend but hey.

Joce got locked outta my house on Friday morning and I didn't wake up until 1030 and she had already been out there since 930, im a heavy sleeper what can I say. Went to my doctors appt. came home nd just sat around. Jarvis came over and I finally hopped in the shower to get ready. We left my house at about 530 6 and went to get Clancey nd brought him to the Valley liq. store. Me nd Jocelyn got a pint and drank that in the BK parking lot. Dante almost fought Roger, while trampling me and I finally got to chill with Devin cuz i havent in like a month, but now I can weneva nd its SIKK...Jarvey left nd it went downhill from there, Joce stole his car and crashed it into the curb, then proceeded to put the bottle under his tire and he ran it over, but didnt pop a tire. She was just extremly shitfaced and couldn't control her actions. I on the other hand only had about 6 shots nd felt absolutly nothing!!! Jarvis had SAT's the following morning so he had to be in at 9. Stolberg nd Perez came to get us nd we went to Morgan park, smoked some more and chilled with Vu nd Mike. We brought some weed to this girl for Vu, brought Joe home nd then I came home at about 1030, there wasn't too much going on that night. 

As for Saturday I went to the mall durin the day with my mom and got a new winter coat, a pink sweater and this cute shirt. Went to Wendys nd ate while visiting Joce and came home. She came here after work nd we walked down to Stoleys house. It was just him Danny nd Joe, we just chilled smoked a blunt nd watched Biker Boys. Other things occured which overwhelmed me even more than I was..jeeeze

Yesterday chilled home all day for the most part and hung out with my dad for a bit. He got a new cell phone, its hott! My mom made the bestest steak dinner ever so i chowed down on that and then got dropped off at Joceys. Walked down to Bk, nd then walked to Mcds to eat, back to Bk nd met up with Carla Tan Dan Seth Harun Dominic Andy Pat Jarvis Trippi TonyS Jim Vay Stanton TonyF nd Derrick. Mostly every1 left cept Jim nd them so we chilled with them. Me nd Jim had sik convos about the bum we picked up last winter, and then the time Tony fought him. haha Stanton stole Jims car and brought us to Jocelyn at around 11. My mom was dying her hair so I waited until 1145 until she came to get me. Last night was freezing as shit out nd boring as fuk too, as for today its the same. GAYYY, who knows if I will do anything tonight for a bit, nd uhh school tomorrow. How awesome is that.

I only have 2 butts left, its kind of upsetting if you ask me. I have no motavation what so ever, I have so much laundry, my rooms a mess but honestly I dont care!

Monday/
Went to school and had a pretty shit ass day, Jocelyn came over after school and stayed here until about 8ish, and she was going to sleep here but her mom wouldn't let her. We had some crazy talks with my mom about drugs and what she did when she was younger, and we taught her what a blunt was, she always smoked ""bones"" aka joints...it was histerical. Went to bed quite early because I didn't get to take my afternoon nap :(

Tuesday/
School once again, gay as usual, Loui nd Corey brought me nd joce to her house, where we just chilled, ate some food and went to meet Tony at QCC on his mini bike, that shit is HOTT! He took me for a spin around the track, i want one of those lil gadgets. Walked back to her house, ate some more food and Jarvis picked us up at about 6ish. Went to buy butts and headed to Bk to meet Stoly. Shabo Mario Eli nd Jeff came down as well as Perez Richie Danny Geradi Nick and Johnny Grey. Richie took Jarveys car with me nd joce nd went to pick up Andy. Took a little detour back to BK while Richie made Joce shit her pants (kidding) just to find out Jarvis had left to go get trees. Caitie nd Carla came down but it was too cold out to get out nd pay a visit so i stayed in the car. Joce decided to take the car for a spin a few times and andy thought he was superman or some shit and jumped in the car while it was moving. I jammed to some Rufio and chilled basically. Jarvis came back and brought Andy home and them me. Right as I walked in the door i hopped on the couch and watched One Tree Hill, sikkest show! hit the sheets and got up to go to school.

Today/
School was gay, it was fukin freezing out which blew asshole. Took the bus home for mayb thhe 2nd time and chatted with Bobby for the whole bus ride, and Nick taught him some things to piss me off, knocking on my head and beating on my ribs, im surprised im not covered in bruises. I tried to take a nap but Jocelyn called and told me Derrick was dropping her off, so i hadda get up. We chilled here and my mom brought us some Mcds. Jocelyn went home at about 730 and here I am. I have a smidgen of homework but im debating on whether or not I should do it. ehh who knows.

Tomorrow is the last day of school until Tuesday, thaaannk GOD! No set plans for the weekend, hopefully it wont be gay or I wil shit on someone. Gonna go smoke a butt, nd oh yah i got this pack last night at like about 7 and i only hav 7 left, scatch that now 6!

I didn't do much yesterday, went to the mall with my dad,got a cute shirt and a new bag, ate there and then came home. I didnt feel good so I took a nap and then Joce called me and her Corey nd Lou came to get me. We ran some erans for Loui nd then got a bottle of Sky Blue from Bruce..We went back to Loui's nd from there the night was sikkkk. I finally met Danielle, shes fukin awesome, weird ass shit was goin on and I was to bent to realize any of it. Corey made us some sik drinks and me nd joce played some smoke nd fire, that game always seems to get me extremly shit faced. In btw. drinking we all smoked cept Lou, and that got me even more fuked up. I made a few random calls to Jarvis nd left an insane message that I listened to today, nd at about 11 we took a cab home? Im still not exactly sure why we didn't call my mom or something for a ride but hey, By the way the African cab man was friggin crazy, he almost killed us like 5 times because he doesn't know how to drive. Came here nd for some reason hopped in the tub to take a bath, anotha thing im not to sure about..:/  From about 1145 on will be left unsaid. 

Woke up at 1030 nd for the most part felt fine, we smoked a butt nd thought back on some shit that went on last night and wondered why the fuk these things happend nd how insane some of these happenings were. I'd like to add that Joce busted her ass in my house...it was friggen priceless. Jarvis came over at about 1130 nd waited for us to get ready. We chilled here for a little while longer and then went to the movies to see Ladder 49, what a sik movie that was. Me nd Joce shed a few tears nd just plain enjoyed the movie. Stopped by Andys house nd chatted with Mark Dan Tim & the family for a bit and went to bk so joce nd jarvey could smoke. Andy went home, which was funny because we chilled for all of 20 minutes. odd. Not that it really matters, he hates me anyways. For what reason I dont know. Came home ate some food, watched Not Another Teen Movie, and here I am.

My moms FINALLY bringing my cameras to be developed, I have absolutly no idea whats on them either, cant wait to get em back. Im pretty sure Im swtichen outta my 4th period class, but seeing how its already been 5 weeks it going to take a week or two i guess. I just need to get the fuk outta that wak class. Gonna go smoke a butt nd lay down, its a bit chilly out so I will curl up in some blankeys nd watch the boob tube.

Today me nd joce got dismissed at 1230 and went in the parking lot to find jarvis nd stoly hidin out..haha what weirdos, got picked up by joce's brother and came to my house. Chilled with Jarvis nd Andy while they went around selling gold cards, then came back here with her, she ordered pizza and pedone nd glen payed a little visit. Moe picked us up around 7ish and we headed to this all black party to steal liqour but they had wak shit so we bounced to seamus'. It was pretty straight until he pulled a nutty because maddddd ppl showed up, then from there met up with the usual at Bk..came home at 1030 nd here I am.

Tomorrow I have noooo idea what Im doing, prob not going to the Home-Coming Game, lack of school spirit I shall say. I might go out with my dad to get a few shirts and then who knows about the night...I kinda wanna drink because I rarely do, but who friggen knows.

"event","Well  haven't updated since friday because I havent felt the need to go online. Stayed home all day saturday until Jocelyn and her mom came to get me at 730ish to head to the game which we were already late for. Met up with every1 nd just chilled, we all got kicked out for being rowdy, and from there it went DOWNHILL...let me just say im never using my feet if I dont have too, after the mission me nd jocelyn walked im never walking again. We met up with Stoley Jimmy nd Scott chilled at bk nd watched a lil drug bust. It was straight tho the cops let em go. Perez Nick Geradi nd Johnny came down and Jimmy nd Scott left. Stoley brought Jocelyn home nd them me nd we talked about the good ol' elemantary school days...mad sikk!

Sunday was just full of excitment. Jarvis came over nd I finished gettin ready nd we headed out nd bought some weeeeed. Smoked nd headed to Shabos nd then to the Halloween outlet. Met up with a few ppl and then Shabo bounced with Mario nd Eli, from there we went to this kid Todds house nd smoked 2 more blunts, man was fucked up. I got to talk to my sisters ex boyfriend which was good because I haven't talked to that kid in so long. Andy called Jarvey as we were on our way out from Todds and we headed to his house to pick him up. We went nd saw Mr.3000 but I couldn't really tell you if it were good or not because I had the worst headache nd kept fallin asleep, it was kinda hard with some1 snoring next to you and bein hit nd blown on for closing your eyes. Came home nd layed down nd finally fell asleep.

School was wakk, it was a lazy day for me, and my 7th period teacher didn't even realize i was gone on friday which was sikk...Jocelyn the bitch didn't go to school today bcuz she was hung over and couldn't make it, nd now shes writing histerical comments in my agenda...might chill with jarvis tonight, ehh who knows..

"event","Well yesterday was a crazy day!!

Left after lunch with Jarvis nd Jocelyn, came here nd chilled for a little. They left and came back to get me at about 530 with my sister so her nd jarvis could smoke a blunt nd then we dropped her off at Ryans. We went to BK nd chilled with Richie Danny Nick Mark Amanda Jill Shabo nd Eli, we smoked some more nd then headed to Jess's, and it was pretty fukin insane from there. 

Mostly every1 was caaacked off there asses which was histerical to watch, and it seemed that every room I went into I would turn the corner and someone would be hookin up. I cant even count how many times i saw people on top of eachother. A few random people showed up, as if I should talk because Im normally a random person anyways..haha 

Me Jocelyn nd Alicia witnessed Justin gettin naked in the bathroom, if only we had a camera nd binoculars it woulda been perfect. 

People were running around screamin thinkin there alcohol was stolen, or that people were fighting, Jess flipped a nutty because people were being disrespectful and spilling shit on her floor nd leavin it, and bein extremly loud which was completly uncalled for. Thats exactly why I dont have people over because shit gets outta hand. Overall it was a pretty ill night. 

As for today and tonight I hav no idea what Im doing, hopefully it wont b gay...

Its been a little over a month nd its going to drive me crazy!!! As for something else, Im done, so very fukin done!

"event","Well after school on Monday there was like 15 of us girls all piled in Moe's van to go home. We brought every1 where they hadda go and me and jocelyn waited outside of moe's house while she made a quick phone call. Carla called so we picked her up at Martys nd headed to Wendys nd fed our fat asses. We picked up Caitie and headed to the boys soccer game. The things Caitie nd Carla talk about in public is priceless, they had me crackin up. Half way through the game we all went inside to pee and watch the cheerleaders for a minute, then went in the car to smoke a butt. Once we came back we sat with Andys mom, Amy and her 2 month old son, hes so adorable. The game ended pretty quickly, we won 1-0! Moe brought me and jocelyn to her house and we hung out there for a bit until Jarvis called us at about 615ish. We left with him and bought a gram. We went down to Bk nd blazed nd Stoly nd Danny came down, Nick came down nd then Perez nd Johnny Grey. Of course me nd jocelyn got unbelievably high and weren't quite sure what to do with ourselves. I accidentally scratched Nicks car because i flung jarveys door right into the side of his car because i was in a major hurry to pee...drove around for a bit, stopped at the church nd finally came home. 

Yesterday was just a day from hell. I was in the worst mood up until the end of 3rd pd. nd then i decided i didn't wanna go to Algebra so I found Amanda M, nd asked for her to skip with me. We went outside nd smoked a couple butts with Adam nd just walked around. Went to lunch nd smoked anotha butt with the other Amanda. I found out some interesting things about her, which in a way disapointed me because of the way shes gone about everything. It just makes me relize shes never going to change unless she relizes this isn't the way to go out about her highschool years. Finished up the rest of the day, came home and took a 3 hour nap. Watched my shows from 8-1030, which by the way were fukin SIKK! I relized I didn't want to go to school today so I planned out faking sick. I set my alarm for 425 nd woke up nd ran into my moms room and told her I had just puked, she already knew I didn't feel too good earlier in the night but I could have gone to school. I went back to bed and just chilled all day. 

Two more days until Friday, who knows about plans for the night,I dont think Im drinking or smoking this weekend unless I suddenly get in the mood. 

Seeing as im bored as shit, Im going to read entrys from the very beginning of the summer and just think back to some shit that went on, because over the past week or so Ive relized how much of the summer I miss and how badly I want everythin to go back to the way it was...

Ive done a whole lot of nothing all day, I was going to go to the football game but i decided i didn't wanna freeze my nipples off so i didn't go. I cleaned my room a little and went through a bunch of shit i haven't looked at in a while. I need butts really bad, 10 billz, butts nd weed? sounds like a plan to me! Its just about 7 and I might go out with Joce nd Jarvey for a little but thats only if hes around like he said he would be. 

Last night was pretty ill I was just sittin here thinkin about the insane drunk conversations Joce nd Andy have, we established Im a good person and that im pregnant? yahhh..Jocelyns the godfather, Larrys the godmother and Andys the dad? It was also pretty weird when Jarvis told odies brother I was his girl and he loved me? I love being around drunk people when im sober. I was in a bad mood thats why i didn't get liqz but once i get there i wanted to drink, shit just happens that way. Atleast I had my fun on friday night, damn was i bent. 

Ughh school tomorrow, have to get up bright and early nd deal with teachers all day long, hows that sound for fun? I think after school me nd joce are gonna go to the boys game and then who knows but I dont wanna come home. 

Im gonna cuddle up in some blankeys..

We got a bottle of soco nd got extremly fuked up...i honestly dont remember half the shit that went on except for peeing infront of random ppl...came home nd pretty much went straight to bed.

I had to get up at the crack of dawn and go to the dentist to get a cavity filled. Came home nd got ready nd Jarvis came over. Before he got here i smoked a blunt with my sister and ryan and then jarvis came and we smoked anotha one. I was pretty fukin high. Jarvis left to go get Andy nd Caitie to see a movie and then he was gonna come bak to get me for the night. Caitie ended up not coming out, but i dont kno if she was supposed to or not but either way she wasn't in the car wen they came to get me. We met dan nd them at wendys so they could get liqz nd then we headed to odies house. 

Quite the crowd of people there if you ask me, overall it was a straight night. Hopefully no1 got in trouble for being cocked off there asses. 

Kinda tired and in a bad mood, which has been on going since fukin forever. its strizz tho...

Woke up bright nd early to find out geradi cant really bring me to school anymore because his dad took his car away for some strange reason. So my mom brought me today nd is going to continue bringin me. Jocelyn came over after school and once again I got a ride and she took the bus, strange child she is. Chilled nd talked about a few things,smoked some butts and Jarvey nd Andy came to get us. We smoked a blunt (minus andy) and just chilled. Thought about seeing a movie but never ended up going nd then we got shabo, him nd jarvis smoked nd we just chilled. I love how our blunt was like a baby compared to theres...haha dropped him off nd went to blockbuster so jocelyn could buy The Butterfly Effect and then I came home.

Ive been in a pretty bad mood for the past few days. One because my fukin period decided it would fukin come bak..wut the fuk is that shit!? 

As for friday Im almost possitive were going to the boys home game because tomorrow its away at HN nd me jarvis nd joce MIGHT go to wrights with everyone friday but probably not because someone doesn't want me to go and jarvis nd joce aren't possitive they even wanna go. I think its pretty pathetic, the whole situation at hand, how i get involved? hmm wakk do i care? of course i do but why should it get to that person...ha hmm fuk it!

going to smoke with my sister, im turnin myself back into a little pothead...not good not good..

Picked that up from Santo nd then headed to Bk, ppl showed up in nd out nd crazzy shit went down. One fight there, cops stopping us, fat gettin pulled over, cops looking for us?, another fight at the movies, mario nd his crazy self doing insane shit, a fat old man trien to fight some of us, jocelyn gettin hit in the face but who? more insane things went on...bascially almost everyone was out at one point or another tonight which was pretty sick, but damn do people piss me off, especially the ones who r fukin two faced as hell. 

School was alright the regular bullshit i guess...I dont hate it as much as i thought i would just because im with everyone now but its school dude, it sucks. 

I had an extremly long talk with my dad tonight for an hour and a half about everything. Him and his girlfriend situation which i feel bad for him, smoking, drinking, other shit too, i love it when we have talks like that I tell him everything, the only thing he doesn't know is that I smoke butts because hes never wanted me too and my sex life, the 2 major things but he knows i occasionally smoke and drink and it doens't bother him as long as im careful nd shit. 

There are the nights when I think of the past, but then the times when i think of whats going to happin in the near future or for that matter not for another year. It bothers me to know alot of things yet not be able to voice them because its something i cant get involved in which sucks because there hurting and its killing me inside to know this. 

I hav no butts at the moment which blows maddd fat cock!

speakin of which...im so down right now, for a little luvin..haha

Geradi gave me a ride home after school as well as Amanda M, yet jocelyn proceeded to take the bus once again, odd child she is. Chilled here, ate some food, chilaxed, called jarvis told him he should come to the movies with us nd no later was he at my house. We dropped my sister off at Ryans because of the DUMBASS he is...then went to go see Napolean Dynamite, awesome movie, pointless but histerical. I love the fart some1 slipped out durin the movie, it was wonderful! 

I ran into a wall today, dont ask questions I dont even know the asnwers.

Jocelyn fed me some of her thoughts you might say, it interested me, saddended me and shocked me all at the same time, shits crazy she fukin predicted my summer. How insane is that? 

I've come to the conclusion that its over, well the conclusion came to me, its funny how things turn out completly unlike you suspected, but its straight, Im gonna go about my own shit but I'll go back to 'it' no matter what, its everything im comfortable with and everything that makes me happy.

REAL WORLD IS ON IN 27 minutes! sikness

We all got mad high cept Andy nd then decided we wanted to go to the movies. We saw Hero, by far the most confusinest movie especially when ur mad blazed. It was fukin insane, mad crazy fightin shit goin on, the only downfall was it was in chineese nd had subtitles..haha wut fags go see a movie like that? hmm US...

Yesterday I went down to Wendys at about 6 and filled out anotha application cuz some fat btich got fired along with her fat brother. Ate some food nd went to Jocelyns...walked to bk, went to pinecroft nd got free ice cream, YUMMY! then went to thorndyke cuz a certain few were supposed to meet up with us but were gay nd didn't so i called tony nd went down there. I FINALLY saw devin, smoked some butts and caught up on a few things, damn i miss him! chilled in tonys room nd tagged up his walls n then came home.

Today i woke up at like 1130 nd did nothin all day, went to jocelyns, walked to wendys, them mcds and met up with Jarvis Andy Caitie Pat nd Tonelli, bak to wendys nd smoke a blunt with jarvey nd joce, went to honey farms got food, got picked up by mom dukes nd thats all. Neva ended up gettin bent? um ok not cool but its straight. No plans for tomorrow but i guess thats ok its only a monday. 

Its interesting how now that one of my best friends doesn't chill ne more because she fuked up pretty bad, and that anotha best friend doesn't chill period because who knows why, and how anotha some1 is just really gay. I dont like how everythin is turin out since school has started...its not that cute if u ask me...

Im just gonna do my work nd save all my foolin around nd bullshit for the weekends i dont wanna fuk up at all this year.

Tonight was just gay. After school jocelyn came over nd then geradi picked us up and brought her to get her check nd then brought us to the mall with a tiny fee, she bought shoes and got her nails done then we ate some mcds. We chilled with Mike nd Ricky for a while like 3 hours, they crack me up nd then I watched Dodgeball on this kids comp. who works at one of the places...Ricky gave us a ride to Thorndyke where we met Alysse Shauna Sam Jess Theresa Derek Shawn nd Dave we chilled there for a while nd then ended up at the corner. Geradi picked me nd joce back up with Richie nd chilled for about 45 minutes brought them home nd then me. He chilled here for about an hour nd then bounced a lil while ago. 

A few interesing things happend tonight. Yet they both have to be left unsaid lets just say im sad and happy all at the same time...

Who knows what the fuk im doin tomorrow, i know im drinking and thats all i know as of right now...mad tired nd dont feel good cuz i got some mean cramps!

I was gonna walk around for like 5 minutes but my class was full, every1 was all there so i didn't think i should be a little late. The day was great until lunch, it went downhill from there...Me murf jay nd gabby left lunch nd went to the gym nd outside the doors to smoke a butt not knowing kevin nd cassena were already there, all the gym teachers came out because they smelled smoke nd then called weaks. Weaks came over nd walked us to the B-19 office and called Obrian down, gabby kevin nd murf got away with it because they didn't hav one in the hand at the time neither did i but i guess he saw me? i dunnno, but me jay nd cassena can either get suspended or go to the after school smoker thingy, which sucks ass but i would rather go there than get suspended on the second day!

The day went fine from there, I honestly dont think im going to get into trouble because weaks didn't get my name and neither did obrian only the lady gym teacher, but jay told me not to worry cuz he doesn't think there gonna do nethin either. Geradi brought me jocelyn nd tony home today nd then i took a nice long 2 nd a half hour nap nd ate some chipz nd salsa, started doin homework nd then came online.

Gotta wake up bright nd early for school nd hopefully i wont get into any kind of trouble, ha!

He picked me up at about 645 and we headed to get Richie, I met up with Joe Nikki Justin Jay nd Murf, smoked a butt and then met up with Jocelyn Jarvis nd Amanda nd finished my butt. Headed into school with them and me nd jarvis went to the B caf. to get our scheduals, seeing how i was clueless on where to go Jarvey brought me to class cuz his was pretty much right there also. The over all day was pretty ill. I mean for the most part the ppl in my classes are wakk but its straight my lunch is ill, 2nd lunch and i have spanish with Sam Gabby nd Oday, other than that my classes are with sucky ppl.

Me nd Andy tried to sneak out of lunch to smoke a butt, yet it didn't quite work out because teachers were literally guarding every door way so i had to wait until after school. I walked around 5th period with Kayla cuz my teacher is dumb nd let my class out about 25 minutes before lunch so I got a lil feel for the school. I can get around easy its just all the ppl in the halls that pisses me off.

I love how some gookie girl talked to me about chicken today? it was quite interesting if you ask me...As much as I wish summer was still going on school is gonna b sick!

After school me joce nd amanda walked to the mall, i bought myself some shoes and then josh picked us up..we went to BK so amanda could smoke and we found a bum passed out on the tracks..me nd joce woke him up nd then booked it...he was tellin us that some1 was messing with him or sum shit, he was cracked out so it was hard to comprehend.

This summer was fukin awesome, there were a few downfalls as in any time of the year but I cant even count all the fukin crazy shit that happend.

From the very last week of school is when I knew this summer was going to be fukin sik. I spent about a week straight at Jeremys house with Jocelyn Andy Amanda and Jarvis, a few others were there sometimes too. Then those nights at Salters, thats when our little group formed. From those days on for the whole summer it was always me Joce Andy Jarvis and the Amandas. No matter what we always ended up together and even if we did nothing somehow we had fun anyways. I didn't really think that I would become that close with all of them. Even Dan Lewis Glen nd Malki because me nd joce were always at the swett house at the very start of the summer. We would just have the weirdest talks nd just chill. Then we all started going to Amanda M's house, her mom would go to Salem with her boyfriend every weekend so we would all go there and get fucked up nd most of the time i would spend the night there and get up and do the same thing the next night. Bk ended up becoming the place to be again, we hit up Thorndyke a few times and some crazy things happend there..haha every1 was always some where doing something and havin fun no matter what. Even though every1 split up for the summer like usual everyone had an ill summer in some sort of way. 

Over the past few months I've gained an awesome friendship with Jocelyn, we have done some pretty crazy shit, were just pretty insane girls. I love you babiii!I stil hang around with the double A's, but were not as close as before, this summer deffinetly changed everything but its fine the way it is now. Now my umpa, me nd her hated eachotha until this one night at sams house, we decided not to hold a grudge on one another because the past was the past and we needed to put it all behind us. Shes fukin awesome! As for the boys, I just love them all, I can never get into a fight with them or argue over a boy, there fukin awesome to hang out with nd hopefully it stays that way. 

As for myself, I changed alot over the summer. I grew closer to people and far apart from people but I deffinetly learned alot about myself. I never expected half the shit that went on this summer to actually happen, but im glad it did. Now that school is beginning its the weekends im going to look foward to, and the vacations we have where im sure more crazy unforgetable shit will go on. nd I can only imagine whats in store for next summer, sikk sikk, cant wait!

I've blabbed on about enough shit, now its time to relize I need to get up at the crack of dawn for SCHOOL!

"event","I love how tonight was the last night of summer before school starts nd it was pretty gay for more than a few  reasons...

Got up at 10ish, Joce went to work and I just chilled here, Ryan came over and I smoked with him nd my sister. I came up  with these strange ass thoughts about certain people, i think way ahead of myself when im high its pretty funny and to hear what comes out of my mouth is just insane.

Geradi came to get me on his break we chilled for a little and then he brought me to jocelyns. The stuff he told me was insane nd made me want to puke to be honest but theres nothing i can do about what he says...Me nd Joce walked down to bk nd met andy shabo nd jarvis. They left and came back on and off. Tara nd all her friends were down there so we chilled with them for a little. How gay does that get. Geradi picked us up after he got out of work, we stopped by Thorndyke but not alot of people were there so we went to the rituals because a few ppl were there, josh said he'd give joce a ride home so she stayed there nd me nd geradi left. We went to dannys house nd just chilled. I dont even wanna bother with giving details on that little adventure. Joe came with geradi to bring me home nd we talked about our diper days..haha he cracks me up. 

As soon as I got home I had to make a few important phone calls, which didn't really solve my problem because everyone lies to me about everything but thats ok. 

Tomorrow is the last day to sleep late and do nothing all day, then off to school tuesday morning. It makes me sick that summer went by so quicky, but the things that went on are just plainly insane. I wont forget any of it. Looking back on shit that went on just brings a smile to my face because everything that happend was priceless, I'll never forget a minute of it.

Now its the end of the summer, and everything has come to a stop. Maybe because it was supposed to, or maybe for reasons unknown. I know I'll never forget any of the times that were shared and wish it haden't changed but school is here and who knows what the year will bring. Drama im sure theres always tuns of that and it can never be avoided but Im looking foward to a fun year.

I fell back to sleep on the couch because I couldn't stand to be up that early and I just wasn't feeling that great to top it off. Chilled here all day, my dad stopped by and gave us the deal on his situation. I feel bad for my papa dukes!

I got ready and at about 730 Josh and Joce came to get me, we headed to Wendys n got food(lately thats been my life) nd then we went to Bcoat park for jimmy d's keg. It was straight, I didn't drink that much me nd amanda just shared a cup nd then we smoked. Jarvis nd Pat got in trouble nd had to leave so it was just amanda me n joce nd every1 else who was there. Us girls, Josh nd Dave took a ride to Sunny Farms around 1045 so Dave could buy us butts and some for himself and then me n joce got dropped off here.

Shes now practically living here because of everything that her mom is putting her through. Its kind of insane if you ask me. But its pretty ill because were always together anyways so whats the difference. 

Tomorrow is the last real night every1 can stay out late nd drink without having to worry about gettin up at the crack of dawn for school. Hopefully we'll all chill but who knows.

"event","Hmm, well at about midnight last night Mike picked me nd jocelyn up with this boy Ricky, we went to Wendys nd got free food then went for a little joy ride, 125 on the highway?? me nd joce almost shit our pants, we just drove around for a while nd then came back to my house because he had to go pick up some of his drunk friends at the bar. Went to bed and got up at about 11ish. Didn't get ready until like an hour or so after and Josh brought us to Wendys, the bank and then the mall, we brought Jill to her bank on the way to all those places because shes a nut and was gonna walk. 

Jocelyn bought a bunch of cloths for school and what not, then we walked from the mall to my house. Chilled here for a while and tried to make plans for the night. Walked to Bk..whoa was that a mission! I got my soco from glen nd pedone nd joce got her 40. We sat behind the tracks and drank with ryan andrea freddy and a few others. Jarvis came down and I shared my soco with him because he didn't have any money nd wanted to get fucked up. We then walked to Verizon to finish drinkin. Andy nd Caitie met us there nd we chilled for a bit. I by the way was pretty fucked up, but as for the moment I just hav a bad headache nd my stomach is turning, I'll prob puke by the time I go to bed. Me nd Caitie went to the bathroom next to a bush and for some reason I thought a bee was gonna sting my ass? couldn't even begin to explain why i thought such a crazy thing. Shabo came down for a little to chill and then Andy Jarvis nd Caitie left nd drove around nd did whatever. The rest of us walked to the movies to get a drink nd shit. Billie gave me nd Joce a ride to my house and here we are.

Joce is on the couch sleeping right now, she just passed out basically. 

I talked to my dad tonight, hes not doing that great and really depressed because of his nutcase girlfriend, shes fukin insane. He took the whole week off of work to find an appt. because hes moving back to Worcester, pretty ill!

I guess theres a keg tomorrow night, not to sure whether or not Im going to go becaues its the last saturday night because school and I would really like to hang out with every1 and either get bent or somehow fucked up nd just chill. 

I guess that one more time because summer ends isn't going to happen. Although summer doesn't technically end until Sept 21st I believe, but school is starting and Im really hoping something goes on. Its not even that, its just I miss the start of the summer. It couldn't have gotten any better. From the days spent at Jeremys, from the days and nights at ""the"" house, the nights at Thorndyke, the times at Amandas and everthing in between. I miss it so much, theres not a minute that goes by when im not thinking about it. But I guess it all happend for a reason so I just gotta deal with it.

School is gonna be pretty sick for the most part, I honestly cant wait.

Time for bed, gnite <3"

We left Andys house at about 330 and walked down to Wendys and got madd food. Then from there we went to the movies nd saw Without a Paddle, probably the funniest movie ive seen in a pretty long time...haha Went back to wendys and on the way there joce got in a hugeeeee fight with her mom so she was kind of upset. Jarvis called her phone and we met him infront of Andys house, again chilled at his house. As me nd joce were waiting for Jarvis outside, she managed to drop her perfume bottle in the sewer which Jarvis opended and went head first in just to get it. It was an awesome sight to see, too bad i didn't hav a camera. Its these priceless moments that makes me want summer never to end. We chilled at Andys for a while and then his dad brought us to Thorndyke. Silverio Trippi Mark Justin Tonelli Vay Tony Matt m Pat Alicia Alaina Theresa Jess Alysse and Sam where there, pretty wak we just chilled and did nothing. We ended up at the corner of the street within an hour, we seemed to migrate over there. Geradi came to get me joce nd sam at around 1015ish and brought us all home.

Joce is sleepin here tonight and I think were going to the mall tomorrow after she cashes her check. 

Its the last Friday night every1 has together so hopefully it will be ill...as for the moment im leaving and sneakin out with joce...peeaceee out homes"

I had to wake my mom up at 830 to give me money for the beach, but she got extremly angry for me makin her up all though its her fault she didn't leave me my money last night. We got into a hugr fight and I couldn't go to the beach. She also didn't know i was going to go with Brian because i didn't think she would let me so I didn't bother asking...which put her in an even worse mood when she saw Andy nd Brian outside waiting for me. I was extremly angry and sat on the couch for an hour in silence thinkin about how I could be on the way to Hampton..FUK! I ended up falling back asleep until 130. Woke up nd geradi called me, he came to get me and we went to his house so I could see his car..its fuked up but atleast he has a back up car...saw joce at wendys n got free food...visited andrea at work nd then headed to FGM and drove around up there for 15 mintues..im ill at driving...i'll be sick once i get my permit nd shit because geradi lets me drive nd shit. Came home got ready for the night nd Joceys mom came to get me and we went to gay BK...ppl were there, pedone came to giv joce her vod, chatted with them, she drank, caitie n carla came nd we had CRAZY talks about shitting, pictures of shit, and this slut that we all no and love HA scratch that..HATE! Then Billie nd Fred brought me home for 11.

I still cant gather all thats happend this summer. Its almost over and I cant believe half the shit that has happend. Its pretty insane if you think about...as ill as last summer was this summer topped everything that happend in my whole fukin life man..its craziiiness, but we hav like 5 days left and somethin ill must happen every night until the night before school. 

Who knows what the deal is for tomorrow..I might be sleeping at Jocelyns house but not too sure yet.

Woke up pretty late and immediatly got ready and went to Bobs and then the mall to see if i could find some cute shirts. I got a free pair of jeans because the fat shit at the register forgot to ring them up but im not complaining. I got 3 pairs of jeans, a hoodie and two shirts. Plus all the other junk I got a few weeks back. I just have to get shoes which my daddy will be taking me to get. I saw Mike at the mall working so he took a little break and smoked a butt with me, we had the weirdest coversation and just chilled outside for about 15 mintues. Met back up with my mom and headed home. I got dropped off at jocelyns and Josh gave us a ride to BK. Malki Glen Dan nd Lewis were there, by the way I love how lewis beat me for the chicken and how Malki kicked my ass, i think my ear is gonna fall off now! Some gay people came down and just chilled there for a while. Headed to Papas and ate again because jocelyn offered me pizza to get me fatter..THANKS ALOT! but it was gooood. Talked to Meghan shes so damn funny and then back to bk to meet jarvis and the amandas. Andy came down at about 10 and chilled with him for a bit. Came home and here I am.

Tomorrow is going to be an awesome beach day...Gettin up at fukin 7, gettin ready, bringing the sister to work, getting Jocelyn and heading to Hampton for the day. I need some sort of a tan for school. Im pretty sure I'll be back at the beach on Tuesday but I will know for a fact if thats happening tomorow night.

Umm I found something out tonight that didn't make me too happy, so I proceeded to whip my bag on the ground, crushed my butts, broke my camera and my lip gloss. But on the ride home I relized that it happend so long ago and not to care so I broke all that shit for nothing which irritated me a bit. If people only knew how big of a SLUT she really is..i mean c'mon now shes not even in the 9th grade yet(cant talk) but Im not a slut thanks. 

Its also heartbreaking to know that once school starts its over for good. I need to live up the next week as best as possible. Im also hoping that when school starts the lil group we've formed wont fall apart. Its not gonna happen in the very  beginning because its going to take a while for everyone to split up and go off with other people, but its deffinetly going to happen :[. Its gettin late I need to go to bed.

nd Jocelyn Im never going to forget last night! ilu babe

We watched some tv and then her cuzin Alisha brought me home around 2. I did the shit i hadda do around the house, and jarvis and amanda stopped by for a bit. It was raining like a fukin bitch today which wasn't to cool! Me nd amanda were gonna do a rain dance but she didn't wanna get her only change of cloths soaked, so we scratched that idea. Jarvis Shabo Andy nd Amanda came to get at about 6 to go out for the night. Jocelyn came out as soon as she got off work and met us there. We chilled at Mcd's then went to oddfellows to pick up trees. Then we hit up Wendys to talk with Dan Lewis Malki Ed nd Pedone. I chatted with Pedone for a while because I haven't seen that motha fucka in quite some time. Joce Andy nd Jarvis got liqz so we parked so they could drink. We then headed to Price Choppers to harass Geradi and that bitch really irritated me tonight, hope nothing comes bad from that. Jarvis supposidly hadda be home for 1030 (hint hit) so we dropped Joce n Andy off at mcds so they could finish drinkin, shabo at his house and me at my house. For some reason I got into a horrible mood all of a sudden, for a few reasons i guess, but w/e. 

Im hitten up some stores tomorrow with my mom to try and finish school shopping and then who knows for the night, we shall find out. Monday if its gonna b nice i might hit up the beach with my mom for the day, and tuesday if all plans go through im hitten the beach up with the bitches...then a few ill nights and then FUKIN SCHOOL, wakk but i honestly cant wait!

I also went through a bunch of shit in my room and throughout the house and got rid of mad stuff. I stumbled upon old pictures from last summer which brought back alot of ill memories, too bad none of the memories this summer were on camera! I got ready and Jarvis Andy nd Joce came to get me. We headed to Amandas for the night because it was a poopy night. We decided to watch Saving Private Ryan, maddd ill movie i've seen it so many times. Other than that we just chilled and talked nd shit.

Im so stupid, I should always listen to my love jocelyn, but hey i never really do because i discourage the situation. But tonight, the banjo music in the closet and that whole time from then on in made my fukin night duude...tonight was deff. illll..

"event","Once again set my alarm to get up early and do something with my life, yet got angry that it went off and whipped it at the floor. Luckily it didn't break I need that shit for school. Finally got up at 130 and did nothing with my life once again! damn im a boring person. Smoked a few butts and watched Jawbreaker. Got ready nd had my papa bear bring me to joceys house, chilled there for a little and left for a walk to god knows where..ended up at bk with gay shitheads so bounced from there to wendys n ate like the fatasses we are. Nothin was goin on tonight so we had my mom get us at 930. 

Tomorrow Im really going to get up somewhat early and do something. I actually need to do some cleaning of my room its a mess, and shit for my mom because shes givin me some money. Who knows whats going on this weekend, beachday was planned but who knows and im finishing my school shopping soon because my mom has a little vaca coming up so major time being spent at the malls...fun fun fun!

It was just a me and jocelyn night tonight. Even though we did nothing, the whole time we had ourselves crackin up because when we get together theres just no telling what may happen. Shes the only girl I can trust these days, she knows everything, and hopefully it stays that way.

"event","Well today had gayness written all over it. I went to bed last night with a pounding headache, woke up with it also. Couldn't get rid of the basterd to save myself, finally went away but now its back again..WOOHOO!

Got ready to go out, yet didn't. Jarvis' car broke down and I only had a ride to go out not home and I wasn't planning on walkin..FUK THAT. Chilled here watched an ill ass movie then tony came over. I haven't really hung out with him in a while so it was pretty straight. Now im just bored n fukin annoyed.

For some reason i got into a wicked bad mood last night. Im not sure what triggered it but nothing is puttin me in a better mood. We dont hav that many days left of summer and its pretty shitty right now. The beginning was so fukin ill and now its fukin wak. 

Someone who I was really close with @ the beg. of the summer I cant even trust now, something i thought was gonna be mad ill or atleast last for a little while didnt. And one of my best friends seems to be slowly growing closer and closer away. It kinda sucks and once school starts shit is gonna be even more downhill because everythings so different. 

Now shit just has me thinking, I dont regret anything I've done this summer, I just want to know how things would be if they didn't happen. 

Ive done way to much thinking in the past 2 days, I need to let whats gonna happen, happen, and who knows..."

"event","Got up pretty late, got ready, brian came to get me with the double A's at 530, headed to Amandas watched them get ready, talked with Jarvis about alot of shit, Hes deffinetly one of the guys who I tell shit to and can trust and he knows he can do the same. Picked up Joce nd headed to Bk. Drank with her behind the fence n seeing how im sick at smoke nd fire i seemed to get pretty buzzed. Andy Malki Danny nd Richie showed. Bk was hateful so we stopped drinkin. Ate mad food all night and made ill porn in jarveys car. Ended up with geradi? He brought me home for 11 and here I am.

School is in under 2 weeks. To be honest I cant wait, Im just scared of whats gonna happen to all of us. This summer, Ive made myself some ill memories, stuff I'll never forget and a few things Im deffinetly takin to the grave. 

I needa finish school shopping, and I desperatly need a job. I have a bad habit going on that I cant even supoprt. Shit that sucks. 

Ive been thinking about alot of things lately, and something that Joce had said the other night has really made me think of whats really going to happen. I just wonder I really do, but mayb i shouldn't think of whats going to happen in the future and make sure I concentrate on all things around me in the present.

Maddd old jam...Cuz I cant make you love me,if you dont,you cant make your heart feel something it wont. 

gotta love it

Chilled, got ready, went to the mall, chilled with mike, joce spent mad $$, petey gave us a ride home and stopped at the liq. store, went back to the mall, chilled with mike some more, smoked butts in unauthorized places (what rebels), ate mad chocolate:{

School is right around the corner and I hav yet to finish shoppin, got a few outfits but not done yet. I think school is gonna be pretty sick, but then again everything has its downfalls i just hope us few stay together as a lil group and not drift apart too much.

"event","I wanted to go see Devin yesterday but hey no one wants to answer there phones so that never happend. Brian came to get me and we headed to Amandas. He then picked up Tonelli nd Andy nd came back over to Amandas, Trippi was already there. We chilled at her house for a while n popped in and out of the keg across the street...Shady people. Amanda G got extremly bent, and didn't know what to do with herself, puked a river and passed out on mandas bed. I however had a pretty ill night. Lets just leave it at that. I made a few  new friends from across the street. Only 3 of them are actually chill, all the other kids are white trash and are a bit odd if you ask me thats why i migrated at amandas for the night. I crashed there and woke up at about 2. Me nd manda woke up to a fukin meal nd a half. madd good. We watched Selina and I called Joce cuz she came home. I missed her a maddddd lot YO! Mom dukes came to get me nd I came home nd got ready. Brian nd Joce came to get me n we headed to the movies to meet back up with Andy Tonelli Justin nd Trippi. Weird shit went down, and we seemed to be gettin followed by every possible cop around :/...A few of the boys at bk tonight decided to move geradis car onto the curb n block him in so he couldn't get out. Only geradi would have something like that happen to him. Jocelyn had a lil drivin experience with Jarveys car tonight, pretty funny altho glen was about to shit himself. Overall it was a straight night other than the last hour. Pretty boring from then until i came home. 

My homeslice might come over tomorrow but shes not sure on what shes gonna do yet after she cashes her checks in. Other than that, im glad the biatch is back!

As much as I want out, I find myself to be sucked in even more than the day before."

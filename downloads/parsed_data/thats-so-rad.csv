"event","<center> So on Monday I returned from <b> COACHELLA</b>(Indio, California).

Yes this post is a wee bit late.  I've had a busybusybusy week at school.
Though at Coachella I had an amazingg time which was great. Took MANY pictures fortunately.
I went over there with my sisters & their boyfriends.  We were able to stay in a nice hotel & everything.
Little did we know it was even HOTTER than expected...



I saw so many bands such as METRIC, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs,Wolfmother,Madonna, Franz Ferdinand, SIGUR ROS & so many more.

haha when we chilled& relaxed on the grass in the bright sun.

<lj-cut text='THE REST.'>

haha yeahh so the first bands we got to see on Saturday, we actually got pretty upfornt near the stage for, where we saw Nine Black Alps, Wolfmother & Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.  That was a great way to start off Coachella.



<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/jenklol.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
Lead singer of the The Nine Black Alps. They were awesome.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/wolfmother.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/wolfmother23637.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
The band Wolfmother.  They were fun enough to get us all hyped up.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/jensaysyeah.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah- they were alright but I really enjoyed them when they played that one certain song.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010077.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
!!Hah yes I was able to see Kanye West too with Andrea


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010122sihgurr.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""> 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/sigurrrkdkfinal.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010095.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">

&hearts; &hearts; SIGUR ROS- I'd have to say besides The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, they were the BEST there.  It was truly enticing. Not only did the audience get into a nice& peaceful state, but the band was also so into playing their music it was just great-AND at the time the sun was setting- perfect timing.
I am very lucky I got the chance to see them there. Too bad we couldn't get closer to stage:/


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010160.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010169.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
Franz Ferdinand- Just great.  The music & songs were just enjoyable enough.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/depechemodeee.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
Then it was Depeche Mode-pretty nice; I just danced to most of their stuff.

Then the second day--


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010186.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
METRIC!! It was too crowded but listening outside of the tent was still pretty chill.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/sunet2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
The sun setting that day


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010204.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs. amazing concert. period.


Then what do you know- as one of the last things we do, we( well my sister Andrea & I go rush off and hurry to go to Madonna- and guess what, we were like 15 minutes EARLY, and on top of that she was a half hour late hahaah.
But man when we got there the WHOLE tent was already crowded all the way across to the nextdoor stage.  But luckily there was a screen.  That was PURE craziness being there to watch Madonna. I loved it when she sung ""Hung Up on you"" but sadly she didn't really sing some of her great 80s songs I love so much.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010207.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/madonna2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010209.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/P1010210.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">

Yup so that was fun. And later on we left right after Massive Attack then Tool played..I wanted to stay to see Scissor Sisters but everybody else was exhausted & complaining so we left.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v211/lachicajen/windpower.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"">
& yesss, the infamous desert wind power energy sighting.
</lj-cut>

<b>We got to see some more bands or part of their shows- which I didnt get any pictures of such as Daft Punk,(wow!), Bloc Party,White Rose Movement, Matisyahu, Sleater-Kinney, etc, & a few more.</b>

But there were a few bands we weren't able to see which I REALLY wanted to, but couldn't cuz we obviousily came a wee bit late or just didn't get the opportunity - Mates of State, The Like,The Murs,Minus the Bear, Ladytron, She Wants Revenge,Octopus Project, Head Automatica...

Though Coachella 2006-simply amazing. So different than last year's but was just as much of a great time.  But beware; wearing jeans in over 100 degrees weather isn't the best idea."

sorry guys, i know its sudden, but there are some people i don't want reading
my journal. anyways, if you're not added already--

<b>+ comment to be added.
+add me FIRST. or i won't add you.
+you have to comment at least every once in awhile.
+that means, not just once & then acting like you're dead.
+i MIGHT not add you, but thats hardly unlikely cause I'm pretty friendly & like meeting new people, even with different interests.</b>

Thank You <3

my computer has a stuupid virus again. its going slower. and most of the time stuupid internet explorer isnt working,i can hardly get to any websites.

so, beccuase of that i dont know if it will take longer to upload my pics, but i plan on taking some pics anyways on saturday or sunday/ monday. hopefully i can get them up. if so, ill post some! & now that i have a digital camera, then i can post pics regularly ! :D thats what i love about it.

well i didnt do anything really eciting this week. starting of on sunday we had a LITTLE life teen xmas party. not that many people went. oh well. at least LESLEY did. she didnt go to school friday, so i couldnt give her her gift thingy yet.

we're gonan hang out this week. shes just the KOOLEST. mhmm.:)
well on tuesday night andrea & i got GIAN to come over. we gave him his present.
i hope he likes it. he better. so we just went with him to best buy, he wanted to take us there for some reason. turned out, he took us there to buy us CDs with this gift certificate bonus he got. how rad that was=)
so i got 2 cds, Snow Patrol- Final Straw & Green Day-American Idiot.
i LOVE both the cds. they're awesome, thanks gian.

i still plan on getting more CD's though. like, The Killers. i really am <b>DYING</b>to get it.

my school gets 3 weeeks off. how awesome is that? i really need this break.

so what are some of you people doing? im not doing anything which is getting out of the state or whatnot, i just might go up to the snow with my family or something like that. i really really have to do well on my geometry test this friday, or else im in real deep trouble.(: yeah, thats becuase math has ALWAYS been my worth subject.

nothing really exciting has happened these past 2 days. life night was, uh what you would call,'a fun lesson' haha duane ofcourse made it fun as usual.
oh & steve came & visited! which was a total surprise for all of us. it was great seeing him , its not the same without him still. he was like, the COOLEST core. haha. yeah so life night was fun because of that.

again im so happy about my digital camera i cant wait till i get it again on christmas. im DEFINETILY gonna take lots & lots of pics.

for journalism this month's issue i did an article on ONLINE JOURNALS. how funny is that, cuz im writing in one right now. i thought it would be kind of interesting since i have a livejournal, and there's still some people who have NO IDEA about it. 
well otherwise, things are pretty boring:) im gonna make plans with lesley & still need to make plans with toni. yea i really cant wait to get out and do things this winter break.

ok, well i gotta go back now to do my muy estupido epsanol menu book project...

<b>You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done</b>

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
<b>Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear</b>

Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

Light up...

Slower slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is to find an easier way
To get out of our little heads

Have heart my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear"

"event","haha ok well i was grounded for the week, meaning i couldnt use the computer. why all of you are asking. cuz i didnt do my make-up homework over the weekend, even though i was like given a WEEK to complete all of it. so yeah, what does my mom decide to do? not let me use the computer. shes just kool like that, mhmm. when i wrote in on here on wedensday at school. haha, well im not 'grounded' anymore. =)

well last weekend i got my new digital camera, yayy! i was so happy, but i could only use it once before christmas. so i took some pictures, but they weren't the best,they didnt come out as i wanted, so im gonna take better pics right after christmas & ill post them all on here for the FIRST time for you all to see. yayy. & when we go back to school im gonna take pics of everyone& such. i just lovee having a digital camera, they're so much easier to use.

well school was ok this week. not anything that great. up to this point i have all A's& B's, one C & one D. oh well, thats much better than before.

what's kind of funny is that ive added everyone off my old friends list on simply_sweet & added them here. yet they haven't added me all back, including the people i know the most. haha. yeah probably because they hardly ever update. yes im talking about you ANGIE & you TONI. <3 lol, yep. well you guys better soon, kapeesh? hahah well im thinking of something interesting to put in the picture, if i had photoshop i could do it myself. you guys see how the little aim figure is by billy in the pic? i want to put  lyrics by it ""..my shadows the only one that walks beside me..."" haha get it? if any of you could do that for me id love you forever. well thats it for now, i dont know what im doing this weekend. i hope i get to hang out with lesleeyyyy.:D

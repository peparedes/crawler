"event","so, yesterday i get ready, take a shower, go to monikas. hang out with moni ali maria abe naanie jan colin tyler jesse megan and taran and anna for a bit.
(yay for putting a face to an email address.) i was in a really weird mood. just, it was weird. i dont know how to act around most of those people, especially megan and maria and moni. i dont know, i guess im just insecure. i blazed a little and that was.. gross. i hate smoking pot. its rather discusting. i hate smokeing cigarettes, they are even more discusting. so anyways. i felt like an outcast, colin and my eyes didnt even lock, or anything, he seems not to notice me but.. kay whatever. so i just followed nalanie. and when i came out of alis house (cuz i buzzed in to go to the bathroom or something) i heard everyone talking to colin about me. i just kind of, stood there, felt like crying. ""shes fuckin 13."" ""pedafile"" then someone yell ""SHES RIGHT THERE"" ""shh."" wow.. kayy. i walk up wih a blank lok on my face. colin goes, ""taylor do you see me going out with you?"" ""...no.."" ali goes, ""but you phoned me telling me you were considering it"" colin: "" well yeah i was considering it look at taylor, shes a pretty girl."" everyone looks at me. im just.. standing there with a blank look on my face as i think "" obviously not pretty enough for you""  i stand back from the weed and shit, some people go inside to eat cake, including colin, and i leave. this isnt funny anymore.
just fuckin love me.
and i need to know, everyone who reads this bullshit, do you like me? (im talking friends-wise) or am i just another annoying little 13 yr old. i need to know wether or not hanging out with you guys is worth it. or if im making a fool of myself.
so, everyone: do you like me."

"event","so today i went to lindsays/alis rugby game and hung out with colin and elena. after the game we went to alis house with a few people and just hung out.. suprisingly i helped with colins grade 11 math and could figure it out. pretty much the same shit were doing. actually, EXCACTLY  the same.
and then taylor felt smart.
but then, i broke my non smoking rule, OH GOD NO. ew. and tomorrow s 4:20 YUS!
but hanging out at alis was fun. colin brought up a point i wish to quote. ""whats funny is that people -want- to have problems. strive for perfection rather than impefection."" and its true. it brought alot of thoughts to my mind. however im a lazy fuck.
then i got home and my mum started bitching at me about my room. nalanie came to ask if i could come over but i had to clean. so i did, then i asked if i could go cuz she said i could after i cleaned, and the bitch still said no. so taylor threw a spazzum. slammed doors threw shit, swore. im hoping to get kicked out oone of these days. oh, and the fucker thinks im baked. walks in randomly and says she thought she smelt something. bitch can DIE.
DIE BITCH :D

i hope i move.
and i hope people visit me."

On the 1st and 2nd, April showers bring some romantic fooling around with bath towels (and maybe very little else!) for you and whomever you're sharing shampoo with. What a way to have some good, clean romantic fun! On the 6th and 7th, your job is to not be too critical. ~Yep, sometimes people are just a little bit dumb when it comes to making relationship decisions. Don't give in to your impulse to wash their mouth out with soap, though. Instead, back off and let them muddle through on their own.~ No reason you should sit at home washing your hair while they figure out what the heck it is they want, however: On the 11th, go out to dinner with whoever invites you. You could be in for a surprise! By the end of the month -- the 28th and 29th -- you're back in the romantic equivalent of a bubble bath. Whoever the lucky person who's captured your heart is, they're dousing you with warm, bubbly feelings. There's even a little yellow rubber ducky! 

'horror'scopes are fun. shpecially scince its the 7th today."

"event","im thinking of taking a few highschool courses in the summer so that  i can occupy myself with things other then drugs and alcohol. that way i can get my edjucation up before i get into distance ed. and hopefully i will end up graduating earlier. if i do two extra courses this summer, one or two extra through the year and two more next summer ill kill off a couple and get them over with. im planning on spending grade 9 in highschool, atleast half of it, then after getting into distance ed. then i can start working on my career and open up a peircing/tattoo shop, provided i have enough money for an aprenticeship. and a couple years after that, i will try to get somewhat of a degree in phycology.
oh god, work work work. maybe it will get things like drugs off the brain, and occupy me so i dont have time for them. i really dont want to end up how i see myself ending up. i want to be smart and have a career i love, still have a social life.. but i dont want one more cigarette in my body.
as of today, i hearby quit smokeing.

last night i went to lindsays birthday. just a coincedence that ali ""wasnt gunna be there"". did dex. couldnt fucking see straight, it was weird. shaking, twitching. me and ali must of gotten.. 45 minutes of sleep. and i was wide awake in the morning. i still am. and my vision is fucked for good. damn the blurryness. and the odd feeling of mis-perception. my fingers feel numb. maybe it wasnt because i did the dex. i mean im sure that was part of it but we also did this thing where you cut off yer oxygen blah blah. and faint. apparently my eyes started rolling in the back of my head and i was twitching, and in reality it was only for aboutu 6 seconds, but it felt like hours. and when i ""woke up"" i didnt know where i was. i thought i was at alis house with abe and maria and jesse and moni. 
odd.
whatever. thats my night. aside from me -falling for ali again.- coughmakeoutcough

kay thanks.
no. but anyways. just came back from nalanies. honestly, just reading her veiws on life has changed mine that much. made me understand the real her, and how much were the same.
yet. she says this. and nalanie im sorry if you didnt want me quoting but its nothing extreme so ima do it.
""you cant be a teenager for long, so take advantage of what you can and have fun with your life no matter the consicuences."" kay, thats not the excact wording and i cant spell but you get the point.
im just pointing out that the decisions ive been making lately have given me the oppertunity to have fun. mhhhm. i really admire nalanie after tonight. mainly because were pretty much the same people, from what i know. and i know that thats not what she wants to hear.
on the other hand, i finally got a chance to talk to beau again. my beautiful beau who is mine this time. miiine. xD his computer crashed. i knew he had no reason to aviod me. i have to see him soon.
yup, thats pretty much it besides the gurlfriend hes had for the past 2 and a half years and him have been fighting lots, and i feel really, really bad. i know beau would never put his heart and soul into someone unless he cares to the extreme. im hopeing i will be cared for like that soon. end of story.
god damn mother and her nagging, telling me i am in dire need of some sleep. im really not. 




its you i miss.

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope 
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe 
Raised in the city under a halo of lights 
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized 

I'm the patron saint of the denial 
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal.

I would have to say that i completely agree with jesse, what were doing is pointless, stupid, and repetitive. so why do i have a need to do it? who knows."

"event","ack. getting things packd is not cool. especially when yew cry. lately i havent cried much, couldnt seem to do it. but now just everything is pileing up into a pile of shit. i just want to roll in a ball and be numb. ah, i remember the numb days. the numbing fluid in the cabinet and the advil, the many advil. take too little and you still can feel yer heart breaking, take to many and yer in the hospital for failed liver, take the right amount and yer numb to the touch, and you seem to get a better night sleep. thats what i need, some sleep. 
sunday we looked at houses after the horse show (in which i came thirrrdd! third mofos. out of what, 10? :D) which was quite sad. because we looked in langley. nows not the time to move my friend, nows the time to go get hammerd. lets to it. besides, i would be fucking pissd if i cant go to pmss and see maria and moni and mc everyday.
enough of that. doing e friday. im excited but kinda worried. 
and i find it quite odd everyone is getting in touch with fathers lately. my mom got mines address two weeks ago.
besides that, my mother got a job today. i dream of jeanie. with a certaini great actress i admire greatly, however im not supposed to tell anyone.
end."

""ali's convinvinced that you're using her for her friends, and for her drugs. ""


peices of me and monis conversation;
fuck fuck fuck fuckity fuck fuck. now that i have done dex which is shitty major and only fun for maybe an hour and she hasnt, shes all mad at me. seems like when shes like fucking out doing shit and im sitting at 

home wishing i could it was fine. alis the only one who gets to me. i care for her in extreme amounts. but god i cant get the fact i still love her out of my head. i dont want to, i really dont. i guess it's the ones that 

you care for most that hurt you. but i mean god, she abuses people so much yet she posts a fucking thing in her xanga or lj about how were abusing her. people like, jan. whove done nothing to her but love her, but 

i even hear hes turning his back on her.

""see you and jan are the only people who could begin to undertstand why her and i could never be friends again. and funnily enough, ven though both of you still somewhat love her, you're beginning to bad mouth 

her.""

i wouldnt want to be. im not even sure i want to be her friend anymore. i jsut dont want to lose everyone else. like actually i love you guys so much, i find you all fasinating. loko up to you. i dunno. could say yer 

the few good friends i have, even if i dont see you much atall. i probably sound obsessive.  i think i should of been in the picture along time before this. just so i could see. oh man i would laugh. and laugh. i bet 

moni me and maria would have been better friends.
ugh i dont know. then she says she wants to be loved and shit and fuck i have the same feelings but most of us are waiting for her to come to us. like jan. god i realy feel bad for him. like actually, hes been nothing 

but good to ali and she just chews him up and spits him out. just like the rest of us. next in line for heartbreak, please.
She's a back stabbing whore at heart. she really is. god i cant belive im saying this. 6 months ago, maybe 8. no, a year? was when i would do anything to be her friend or anything to be in her position. i wanted so 

much for so long, i just realized now ive been wanting all the wrong things. Its called teen depression, she thinks its everyone elses fault.  she thinks everyone is out to get her. She think everyone is putting this shit 

on her. when really the only reason people dont want to be her friend is because shes not picking herself up from this shithole. she just waits till she has another problem to deal with and is too fucking lazy to pick 

up the peices.

""it seems that her feelings are seasonal; watch, in june she'll feel suicidal again""

""just keep talking, i don't mind, and i know taht it makes me feel better.""

im glad SOMEONE understands for once. instead of people prying at my emotions and telling me im wrong. ugh.
im copying a bunch of this convo into my lj, most of my comments aking them a giant paragraph she can suck my cock with.

""hahaha, she'll be furious, i can't wait  ""

me either.

i mean the most she can do is what she did to stphy, an email saying ""ENJOY YER FUCKING WORTHLESS GOTHIC LIFE GOTHIC WHORE IM SAD THE DOCTORS LET YOU LIVE""

and thats that. 



                                                                                                                             -----------------------------------------------------


""If you read this.. even if I don't speak to you often, you must post a memory of me. It can be anything you want.. it can be good or bad... just so long as it happened. Then post this to your journal to see what 

people remember about you."" 


                  -----------------------------------------------------

""u know what i remember most. reeeallly far away memory. i came over one day to alis house. she was lying in a pile of her own tears. screaming. and monika was just sitting there on the computer. not a care. and i went home, and i cut for the first time.
and you know what.
i dont blame her.""

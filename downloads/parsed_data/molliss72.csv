Spent most of the day at the park, hanging out with Nikiss, Swartsy, Meg, and Delia. Niki tried to teach me how to catch a ball with a double play or something LOL.. Then we went to McDonalds with Kim [Meg+Kaitlyns mom] I GOT A QUATER POUNDER WITH CHEESE AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME LETTUCE OR MAYONAISE. Then we went to Kaitlyns house and ate our food and looked at some cool magazine. Then Kelly [Sha-nay-nay] and Sarah came, and we went to go to the High School to MEET SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. But no, she left and she wouldnt be back for a while...... so we left for our game in South Deerfield without her. So anyways.. the ride was very fun. :) Hmm.. oh yeah we lost 4-8... The ump was really bad. NIKISS HAD 2 ALMOST HOME RUNS!! One went under a car. LOL.. me and Nikiss didn't want to use the Sani Can so we asked the park guy for a key to the bathroom.. and let me tell you that bathroom was like V.I.P compared to the Sani-Can.

Fun fun. Also- my brother had a friend [Adam] sleep over last night.. and I was awoken this morning at 7:30 by Febreeze being sprayed all over my head. I pretented to continue sleeping, hoping they'd go away. But no. They proceeded to chuck little plastic army people at my head. Then they realized that the army men were all over my bed and that if they wanted them back they'd have to sneak in somehow. So they decided to ""creep"" [aka bash into&nbsp;the bed and giggle] under my bed and hide there until they had a plan. So when I felt little hands all over my feet searching for the stupid toys.. I finally woke up and punched Dougie. He left.</STRONG></FONT></P>

Then, Social Studies was basically working on our projects.. Science.. [oh joy we love Mrs. Hardaker..] was boring. The quiz was sooooooooooooooooooo hard. It was like impossible questions. I got picked up from school, and me and my mom and my brother and my nana [88 years old.. and still going.] went to Janine's. I got my usual hot with ketchup and mayo. OMG- highlight of the day= when we were driving I saw the Kenya kid walking home and I rolled down my window and said ""HI JAMES!!!!!!!!!"" and he goes ""Hullo Molly!"" AWWW... After Janines we went to the library to return some books.. and I got like 5 books from there. Then, we came home and then I did homework.. and now I am here. Crazy.

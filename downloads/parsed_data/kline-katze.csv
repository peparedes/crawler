The book opens in about 2058 with an MIT graduate student who discovers a time machine. The problem is it only goes forward- 12 times farther in the future each time. It goes forward 12 seconds, then 144 seconds, then 27 minutes, then about 4 hours. . . you get the picture. Soon he is hundreds of years in the future in a  world hardly recognizable as earth. He also lands in a slightly different location each time.<br /><br /><lj-cut>In one future, in one location, Jesus has returned- or at least the people are absolutely convinced that Jesus has returned. History has been completely rewritten to begin in 1 SC (Second Coming.) To a time traveller, this is very confusing. The people know nothing about their own history, even 100 years ago. (The traveller ends up in about 70 SC.)<br /><br />One of my complaints against Dan Brown's writing (<em>Da Vinci Code</em>, <em>Angels and Demons</em>) is his open hostility to the church. What I liked about <em>The Accidental Time Machine</em> is it doesn't make the church into an evil caricature- but it does suggest the possibilities of the abuses of religion. For the people in this time it seems to be a utopia. To the time traveller it seems serious out of touch with reality. Later, he ends up in a  different kind of utopia, and the people there think they are happy, but again, to an outsider it's boring.</lj-cut><br /><br />This book made me laugh, gasp, and think. I highly recommend reading/listening to it- even if you don't normally choose to read science fiction. It is worth it. (And if you do decide to read it, please let me know- I'm really looking for people to talk to about this book!)"

"event","We've had a great summer with our CSA. Today is my first needed ""big processing"" day. I'll make tomato sauce, sweet pickles and a Hungarian style goulash. 

Last year I darn near killed us making goulash. One pepper was all it took to make it inedible. But, I tried the raw potato method and it took enough heat out we could choke down a bowl. This year I was smart and tasted every pepper I put in. One was about 5 inches long, maybe as wide as my index finger, and curled slightly. It was the color of a rubber ducky. That's the hot one. I didn't put it in this year. Who would want to torture themselves like that? Any ideas of the name of this one?

Here's my favorite creation of the summer. I call it TriColor Roasted Root Vegetable Pizza. I roast beets, turnips, a small rutabega, carrots, onions, and garlic in olive oil, salt and rosemary. I mashed the garlic into more olive oil and spread that on the crust, topped it with the veggies, sprinkled on some white sweet pepper and topped it with cheese. The photos are before cooking and cheese and after I pulled it out of the oven. I'd enter it in a contest someday. . .

We often had to stop for wildlife. This crossing of bison takes the cake-- there were about a hundred that crossed the road and waded through the river. The sound was really neat.

I have been experiencing an abundance of good media as of late. Watching Dr. Horrible has been so much fun. I am among the many who wish there was a soundtrack so we could sing along to our heart's content. The wii fit has been a  good addition to our home. Yesterday it told me I wasn't paying enough attention to IPete, and then it said, ""by the way, did you know that eye contact is very important to dogs""? What an interesting . . .nonsequitor? 

I've also been reading a stack of <i>Real Simple</i> magazines a congregant gave me several weeks ago. I love Real Simple. It is practical and makes life seem so manageable. I'm reminded to jazz up prepared foods like couscous with onion, garlic, zucchini and chickpeas (tonight's dinner.) The tip I've been appreciating the most is to store things out of sight. It sounds lame, but moving my tea from the counter to a cupboard does make my kitchen look cleaner (more like a magazine) and doesn't make it any less simple to make tea. So, yeah, my good media has included organizing magazines!"

"event","I finished reading <i>The Host</i> by Stephenie Meyer. She's a pretty big thing here in the US right now because of her fantastic Twilight series. It's about aliens (called Souls) that are parasites to their hosts. One host fights the parasite more than usual- more than the Souls thought possible. So on one hand it's about surviving humanity vs. alien invaders. But it's also a love story because the Soul starts to love the Host's honey.

I am so regretting I skipped and read the last few pages. I would have cried a lot, I think.

In short, I thought this book was good but the set-up at the end was just too convenient. 

Theological reflection, Cut for spoilage
<lj-cut> I thought the end was a perfect process theological conclusion to the ethical dilemma. What do you do when you have  a parasitic life form? The Souls were very relational and highly developed- but so are humans. Take the Souls and put them into less relational beings? It preserves the integrity of the Souls and the humans. Yes, the See Weeds lose out, but even in process thought there is a hierarchy. </lj-cut>"

So, what have I been up to besides work? Reading, gardening, etc.
<lj-cut>
Reading: Lock and Key (it's awesome), Fearless 14 (kinda disappointing)
Gardening: the bunnies won in the green bean battle. My search for the plant I love that I walk by everyday has a new contestant- maiden hair ferns. The spagetti squash seems to be doing quite well.
Entertaining and playing with family: we even went to a cabin for 3 days.
Painting: We are painting our entire exterior this summer. We are almost done with the porch, there's just a fancy bit left and it needs a month to cure before we can do that. I promise to post a  photo when we are done. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut>Have you seen Wall-E yet? We took Katja to her first movie on July 4 and Wall-E was our choice. (Side note- she did ok, but we probably won't try again for about 6 months!)

What a great movie. It was incredibly depressing, cute, full of ""aha!"" moments, utilizes archetypes well, and showed the complexity of what it means to be in relationship. Briefly, Wall-E remains on a desolate Earth full of garbage. His single objective is to compact trash.  In his work he comes across a living plant . . . which sets off a chain of events.

Here are three things I loved about this movie.
<ol><li><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">Wall-E collects random stuff</span>. One of my strengths is input and we inputters end up collecting strange stuff. This explains my salt cellar of used contact lenses. I don't know what I'll use them for, but I hold on to them. Wall-E had a basket of rubber duckies. Why would a robot need rubber duckies? I connected with Wall-E.</li><li><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">The teaching possibilities.</span> I might teach a class this winter at CUMC on the ethic of Wall-E. For years it will be something we can watch with Katja and have deep conversations.
</li><li><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">The end credits</span>. It took me a few minutes to figure out why the credits were so rudimentary. . . but then, wow. Plus, there hope! </lj-cut>"

This week I've encountered a couple of times when I've felt overwhelmed by the work there is to do. Yesterday I was reminded of something that gets me through these hard times. There is a story about three stone cutters, each working on the same project with very different descriptions of what they are doing.  How we describe our work makes a huge difference.

I've rediscovered the benefit of asking myself, how is what I am doing to the glory of God? I decided:

I'm not making the Lay Leadership roster perfect, I am equipping leaders for our community.

I'm not sending postcards, I am inviting new people to be part of our community.

I'm not making PowerPoint slides, I am helping people praise God and encounter God through word and art.

I've often though to ask if I could have some of it for my yard-- people here are friendly like that and it does seem to spread. I finally found out what it is called, rue.

The only difference that I can tell between the plant on my way to work and the columbine that is everywhere is the plant on the way to work seems more lush and the flowers are less annoying.

At the farmer's market on Saturday I found lemon -scented geraniums.  I love these guys. I had one for five years and it died under my mother's care while I was in Germany.  I looked and looked for two summers and didn't find a single one. So yesterday I bought two. One will be a house plant, the other will go in the earth in a  couple of weeks. 

I also bought a jasmine plant. This one will be outside in the summer and indoors most of the year. Does anyone know how to actually make jasmine tea?

Katja had fun playing in the dirt. She probably had more fun simply because she was outside. She actually brings us her jacket when she wants to go out. She can be pretty insistent and will look for it when we hide it. It's a good thing she's starting this at the beginning of the warm season!

I'll type in flowers or reeds or ferns or sad and see how people identify these things when they see them in their everyday lives. Most of the images are really pretty, some are very real.

I am a process theologian. Among other things this persuades me to have a healthy appreciation for beauty and complexity. I love looking at a close up of the stamen of a lily or see that someone noticed a dandelion growing out of the crack in a driveway. This isn't a superficial beauty, it's an appreciation for the beauty all around us.

So about once a day I find myself a flickr looking at images. Maybe I'm trying to see my mood and how others find beauty in it.  It's been a neat way to practice devotion. I encourage you to try it! Here's today's restless kitty.

I'm going to plant wedding favor wildflowers under my black walnut tree. Not much will grow here and nobody (neighbor shares it) bothers to do much. We'll see what happens.

"event","The last week has been really good. I feel like the work/sleep/family/fun balance is going well. Peter took Katja to Milwaukee for a long weekend and I was alone. I love alone time.  I spent most of it ""recreating"" experiences. I went to a movie, jogged and took a bubble bath like I did in Germany. I made noodle soup, listened to Buddha Bar and had bubble tea, like when we were in Kansas. I made guacamole and had Mexican beer.  It was great.

Here's the Kansas recreation. . . yes I've succumbed to the photograph your food movement.

Then, two weeks ago I bought a guitar. I had wedding money I'd been saving for a Wii but they are never ever in stock, so I had  a dream I was shopping for a guitar with a colleague and the next day we went shopping and bought me my guitar. So far I can play D and G.

This is me and little sis jamming.

And, just in case you miss baby pictures, here's Katja eating stringey food- spagetti squash and apfel rot kohl.

"event","I came to appreciate Marmite while I was living in Germany. I favor the New Zealand Marmite to the British, but the British is much more readily available in the US.  

This video is pretty gross, but also funny. Little sis saw it at a  British Advertising Awards exhibit.

We've fed Katja Marmite twice. This is her after a bite. She likes it!

"event","iPete is next to me going nuts. 24 caucuses/primaries tonight, the news can only report so much at once. He's such a junkie!

We went to our caucus. We had to park about 5 blocks away. In some ways it felt like we were going to a sporting event. . . so much traffic. About midway through our meeting they said there were still 500 people in line waiting to see what room they belonged in. Throughout the groups, it seemed like Obama was ahead 2:1. That's where my vote went, since Edwards was out.

My precinct voted on three resolutions. We voted to oppose ammending the Minnesota constitution to limit the rights of couples, we voted to encourage continued support of education, and a vote to impeach Bush was defeated.

All in all, a really cool night."

"event","I am such a girl. On Saturday I went to the US Figure Skating Championships. It was wonderful! We had tickets to the bottom half of the Ladies final (places 11-20) and the pairs final. I saw this proposal! http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/apphoto/photo?sportId=1850&photoId=1790681

It's not really often you get to be part of such a high profile proposal. 

It was a fun way to spend some time not working. The figure skating was incredible.  My sister was glad to see the bottom half-- she said that these are people who know they are really, really good, but they also know they aren't going to finish first. Yet they give it their all. She finds this highly inspirational as a performer Me?I like that nearly everyone fell. It doesn't matter how good you are. When you are doing very, very difficult things, everyone falls. Sappy, but I find comfort in this."

"event","Well, on Sunday Katja has had her first trip to St. Mary's. Keep in mind, we live 8 blocks from the 2nd best hospital in the US and we have really awesome health insurance because iPete works for said institution. Yet we didn't want to be those super annoying parents who bring their kid to the emergency room because she sneezes. So we waited until we knew fro sure we should bring her in, and then we did. They said it was good to bring her in. She's got a respritory infection common to infants.

Tonight she was laughing and clapping her hands. (This is the skill she learned today. It's like she decided ""I'm going to clap today."") Definitely on the mend.

In other news, on Saturday I am going to the Ladies Final of the US Figure Skating Championships!"

"event","I am making two. They actually come from my meditation last week on Deuteronomy 17. It takes a fair amount of ""Amanda logic"" to get from there to here. . . My mind wandered quite a bit. I focused in on the humility I found in the passage. From this I determined I need to:

1. Admit Weaknesses More. This boils down to asking for help when I need it. I even identified several areas when this is going to be more specific.

2. Balance More. Having Katarina was wonderful and life-changing. <lj-cut> I have two areas where I am very specifically trying to balance. The first is working more efficiently. For those who know me well, this may seem a surprise. I pride myself on my efficiency. Because of this, I think there is always room for improvement. I'm going to be checking my email a little less frequently-- it eats up too much time. (Every efficiency article I read names this as one of the best ways to increase efficiency!) I am also going to be enjoying food more. This doesn't mean eating more food-- it means actually tasting what I eat instead of inhaling it, and eating smaller portions with more intentionality. We'll see how it goes. </lj-cut>

What are your resolutions?"

I love that I only begin celebrating on Christmas Eve. I let Advent be Advent and spend the 12 days doing all of the Christmas stuff. . . the shopping, the cards, etc. January 6 is the big deal for us.

On Friday night my mother-in-law and I will cook a big dinner and on Sunday I'm taking the day off, we're taking the baby to an aquarium. Baby thinks Christmas is awesome. Lots to grab. It excited her so much she's become mobile.

Pics forthcoming."

Katja is protesting sleeping alone. She's sweet and wonderful and making it very hard to keep the policy she doesn't sleep in our bed until 5 am.

This week being Thanksgiving, I made a bird. I was luck to find a local farmer (Bernie) who had one happy turkey left- it even grew up in fresh air. The squash soup was totally local, as were all the onions and garlic. We only had 7 for dinner, so it wasn't a huge production. Katja has sweet potatoes and applesauce. 

I had a funeral on Friday and another one on Saturday. These a meaningful ministry, but they take alot of time. Today I also had my first graveside. I almost cried. That's not a bad thing, but it was a little surprising.

I've managed to squeeze in a bit of a new obsession- Gossip Girl.

I wish you all well."

"event","I know just enough Biblical Hebrew to be dangerous. 

Earlier in the week I had to pick a word summarizing the theme for the day. Looking at the Psalm reading (Psalm 119:137-144) I saw the word ""righteousness"" in the same passage as ""faithfulness."" I immediately got excited because the word <i>hesed</i> is translated as both faithfulness and righteousness. I went ahead and plastered hesed on the top of the worship bulletin. Hesed is a great word because it also means loving-kindness.

My whole plan had been to link God's faithfulness with our faithfulness and stewardship.

Then, later in the week, I got down to the word/text study and learned this passage doesn't have hesed at all! It has <i>tsedek</i>, which is only ever translated as righteousness or justice. A great word, but the hesed on the top of the bulletin doesn't fit into the text at all. 

I believe with integrity to the text I can say the author sees God as desiring our faithfulness and faithfulness will produce a life that is really lived. 

At any rate, as the sermon has developed Zaccheus has become more and more a central figure. And I am reminded (yet again) of the importance of thorough preparation!"

<img src=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZF6uRAJKL._AA240_.jpg"" />
This coming Sunday the ""Basics of the Christian Faith"" series looks at the Bible. Of course I am doing my research. This guy is making some really good observations, and I'm still on the first month of his adventure. He's finding that the way he thinks is changing, for the better.

But what is it that made me laugh? In trying to obey Proverbs 22:15 (I'll leave it to you to look up) he buys a super soft Nerf bat. After stealing a handful of nickels, and chucking them across the room he has to swat his son. Even this spongy, harmless act crushes him inside. His son, meanwhile, thinks this is great and begins clobbering his dad with a much harder whiffle bat.

He writes about his lesson. ""So I'm basically sanctioning violence here. The rod is a fiasco. But here's the thing: I agree with the gist of Proverbs. I need to discipline my son more . . . or risk having him turn into a three-foot-tall monster."" (40-41)

I'm certainly not condoning corporal punishment. I feel guilty when I tighten the harness on Katja's car seat and she complains.  But this section first made me laugh and then made me think, and then made me think some more.  Stay tuned for Sunday's sermon!

I suppose this means someday I'll be taking one of our church's parenting classes!"

"event","I really want to compost. In my city most waste is burned. My food scraps become ""heat."" They lost their place in the food chain-- I think forever. I throw out tea bags, onion tops, clementine peels, and garlic skins nearly every day.The problem is my yard really doesn't have a place for a compost bin or pile. I've looked online and in my northern climate, I need to have it ina  semi sunny location. The one place I staked out was totally shady. I'll occasionally throw carrot tops there, but for larger scale it would be a bad place. The city has a place for leaves and grass and another for sticks. (Have I ever written on my unending battle to clear my yard of sticks?)

There might be one option. http://www.cleanairgardening.com/composttumbler.html

It is pricey, but I could put it next to my garage, in the sun. Hmm. Thoughts?"

I've started <i>the Omnivore's Dilemma</i> <lj-cut> maybe to deal with my feelings about being a predator? I've wanted this book for about a year and a half and it is now finally out in paper back. The guy traces where food comes from, including how the US has become a corn-based society.  I bought it at Borders (a large bookstore, better displays than Barnes and Noble) on a Sunday morning. In my world, heaven is Borders on a Sunday morning and lots of macaroni and cheese. </lj-cut>

"event","A normal day in Katja's life--- her PoV

<lj-cut>
1:00am I wake up. I either want to be held for a few minutes or want to eat-- about 2 oz. of milk. Sometimes mommy and I fall asleep in the chair for a few hours. 

3:00am I wake up again, sometimes. I might want to eat another 2 oz. of milk. Daddy changes my diaper about now. Sometimes mommy has to shake the bed to make him wake up. I think this is funny. Sometimes I laugh when mommy gently shakes the bed when I am on it.

5:00am  I think it is time to be awake and play. Mommy does not. She takes me into bed with her and cuddles me. I feel warm and safe and fall asleep.

6:30am about now mommy feeds me, probably about 4 oz. of milk. I start thinking about making a monsterous poop. This will happen usually before 11am. Often I will get new clothes it is so big and messy.

I play much of the morning. I go in the exersaucer, the jumparoo, play on my stomach, sit with rattles and, if I am at daycare, interact with the other kids. Sometimes I had a busy night and take a nap at 8:30am. Usually it is pretty short.

I usually have about 4 oz. between 10:30am and 11:30am. I might nap for up to an hour. Lately I've wanted to watch what is going on rather than sleep. Life is very exciting.

When I'm at daycare mommy comes to see me and feeds me. This happens sometime between 1pm and 2pm. I eat about 4 oz. Playing is hard work!

In the afternoon sometimes I nap for up to two hours.

I have another 4 oz. at about 5pm. It's good to see mommy and daddy.  I might be a little fussy.

At about 6pm I'm working on something new- rice cereal! I have just enough milk to coat the bottom of the bowl and a little bit of cereal is sprinkled in. It's kinda like gruel, but I have fun practicing my new raspberry noises while I eat it.

At about 6:45pm sometimes I take a bath. I get pretty messy when I eat cereal. I love baths. I splash and kick and try to drink the bath water.

At 7pm-ish it's getting to be my bedtime. Sometimes I am fussy and this is a bad part of the day for me. Other times I like it because I am so sleepy I fall right asleep as soon as I am swaddled. I have a little more milk and sometimes a story. We say this prayer: Jesus tender shepherd hear me, bless thy little lamb tonight. Through the darkness, be thou near me, keep me safe til morning light. I like it when mommy hums ""swing low"" as she rocks me to sleep.

I've been getting up at 11pm-ish, I spit out my nuk and want to be held for a little while. I guess I just miss daddy and mommy.

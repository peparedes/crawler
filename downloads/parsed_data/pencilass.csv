<font size=""3"">While you'd probably prefer to stay in bed and sleep through winters,
people keep pestering you to wake up and make wild predictions about the future.
Though they'll treat you nicely for a brief part of the year, most people seem
to disrespect you the rest of the time, unafraid of disrupting your living
situation or ignoring you altogether. You really love basements. Of all things,
you're afraid of your own shadow!</font><br>

"event","So I was looking in old files, and found this poem.  Good job, Anne.

I remember when we first met, 
You look much the same. 
I thought weren't the brightest crayon, 
But I came around by and by. 

You let me share your music, 
When mine was left at home. 
You let me sit beside you , 
When I felt alone. 

You taught me about acting 
At NWCT. 
And all along the way 
You were there for me. 

You pulled out chairs, 
You opened doors, 
You even paid for me, 
You were a gentleman, 
Every step of the way. 

So now that we're good friends, 
It's so hard to recall. 
Why I ever thought you less, 
than what you are. 
I'm so glad to have known you, 
I hope you feel the same, 
Just remember lovers come and go, 
But friends remain the same.


I need to see everybody before school starts up once more..."

"event","So I was working on a presentation, and it struck me how strong I've become in my new-found faith.  It really is relieving to have something to believe no matter what happens.  I was at church last Sunday, and Pastor Heidi had a quote that's stuck with me for a while, so I'm just going to leave you with it:

The Son of God became Man, so that Man could become the Son of God."

"event","<P>So I definitely got homesick last night.<BR>So I decided to go on a nice walk.&nbsp; Alone time really does you good.&nbsp; The only thing I wish is that there was somewhere empty, where I could be good and truly alone.&nbsp; But, you see, I now live in one of the biggest the cities the world has ever seen, and as the urban sprawl creeps out, it seems it is impossible to find an empty field.&nbsp; It made me wish I was in Decorah...<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></P>
<P>So my walk eventually lead me to Taco Bell.&nbsp; What a surprise :)&nbsp; I had forgotten how good it was.&nbsp; Anyway, back to my walk, and contemplations.&nbsp; So I got deep into thinking, that this whole month I've been at school, I've been alone but there are always people around.&nbsp; Every face I see is a new face.&nbsp; It's really hard to get used to.&nbsp; But then I decided that everyone must feel exactly the same way - we're all making acquaintances, smiling, saying how much we love it here.&nbsp; But what we secretly long for is our friends.&nbsp; Our comfort zone.&nbsp; Our home.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>This made me think long and hard about what the point of college life is.&nbsp; And this is what I came up with.&nbsp; For the past four, six, eight - god knows how long - years, we have matured physically.&nbsp; We have seen <EM>kids</EM> our age in the Olympics, seen them in the NBA, seen ourselves essentially grow out of the bodies we had as children, and grow into the bodies we will have as adults.&nbsp; But know it is time for the rest of us to catch up with our bodies.&nbsp; College must be a time when we mature emotionally and&nbsp;spiritually.&nbsp; I think my realizing that is the first step to actually doing it.&nbsp; This cheered me up.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>In other news, there's this girl.&nbsp; I'm trying so hard not to just fall head over heels for her.&nbsp; I had to catch myself twice today from trying to hold her hand.&nbsp; I wasn't even consciously doing it.&nbsp; I just reached out of - what was it?&nbsp; Not habit, that's for sure.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I do know is that, I'm sitting up at 4 am because I've got to much racing in my mind.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I've never understood the allure of a journal, but suddenly I'm enjoying the fact that I can always have ""someone to talk to,"" even if it's just a text box I know won't talk back.&nbsp; I think really what I like is the fact that I can get these feelings out of me without having to confide in someone.&nbsp; I never thought I'd say this, but I like writing.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>What the fuck has college done to me?</P>"

"event","well kt and i broke up after a grand total of 4 days - making this my second longest ""relationship"" ever...
how cool am i?
anyway, its basically the same reason as before: kt's scared.  surprisingly, im not sad.  i mean, yeah i cried, but not much.  she wasnt happy.  it was like as soon as i asked her out, she got sad, and that wasnt cool.  i could tell she wasnt happy, so i tried to help her along.  she cried too, but she was happier, and that makes me happier.  as much as i lover her and want to be with her always, i want her to be happy more.
and i guess thats what love is...

its been a fun ride kt"

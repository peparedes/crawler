"event","In retrospect, talking about porn with girls is highly akin to talking about drinking with your parents. You're always a little afraid to enter into the conversation, for fear you might slip up, and reveal just how much experience you have in the area.



I also don't know what quixotic means. This could spell trouble"

"event","I don't care what anyone says; watching porn with drunk girls is hilarious. Not only do you get porn, but you get critiques of style and skill level from drunk girls. 

That's just plain awesome

"event","I don't have much worthwhile to say. I played risk, and lost, and had a job interview, which I rocked, but I will probably turn down the job if I get. so because I have nothing interesting to say, I am going to put down all the weird shit I wrote in the margins of my notes during class.

"event","Tonight was interesting. The plan was to dodge the Harrington vs. Rigby game, cause I really don't give 2 shits about hockey, and read all night. Didn't really work out that way.

I ended up going around prospect dropping off resumes with Dan, and going to the bank and the liquer store. when I got back, I ended up in a long conversation with Crazy Meagan, I guess in some effort to work out stuff between us so that it wouldn't so damn wierd hanging out with Blair when she's around, which is every single time. It turns out I wasn't as alright with all that stuff as I thought, because it was actually a difficult, and helpful conversation. I left in the middle to shotgun some Fax, and had a nice buzz going when I returned. at one point it actually got to the point where she couldn't keep talking online, and came over. Basically, we hashed a lot of shit out, and it wasn't too bad being around her, so I guess it worked out.

I figured I'd learn new things about myself at University, but I never really guessed that that part of University would be harder then classes. Maybe it's just cause I'm at a liberal arts University. Meh, live and learn, I guess."

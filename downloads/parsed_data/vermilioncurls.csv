"event","What do you do when you realize that someone brings you down?
What about if that someone has been your sole friend for almost a year?
What if that friend is jeopardizing friendships with people you have known even longer?

do you cut the cord?

do you try to explain to that person?

what do you say to those who have suffered because of this one friend?


how do you explain to someone who is so emotionally unstable due to depression that that someone's rash actions (like running off into the night drunk, to get on an hour and a quarter train and then to walk 2.5 miles in the dark in the middle of the night) are potentially physically endangering that person, as well as putting stress on that person's friends?  i mean, so emotionally unstable that the person will yell at you and call you a bitch for trying to explain why not everything is good and whole in this world, and maybe walking home in the dark drunk is not a very good idea.

does that deserve anger?  should that action provoke a name-calling session?

do people who suffer from depression really want their ""friends"" to help, or just to listen?  can they be friends to people?  can they listen as well?

i just want to be able to talk about my problems too, just every once in a while.  i want someone to be strong for me.  but i guess that is too selfish, and i will just continue to try to tell someone that her actions before she ran off into the night make me want to consider never talking to her again.  

i am just afraid for her, that she will be all alone in this life, since i am the only one who has stuck with her.  i just wish that if i did something to deserve fierce anger and rudeness, that she would tell me instead of just calling me a ""fucking bitch"".

on a side note, my dreams were shattered last night when i found out i didn't make the csc:'(

the only people who were there for me were my parents.  and they were asleep.


the two people i thought i could talk to won't talk to me.  one, because i won't call her (and if that explaination above i just gave isn't enough to tell you why, then i can't talk about it) and the other because she is mad at me BECAUSE of the first part -- the way i react to this downer friend -- and won't answer the phone."

"event","it's like i am back in college.  i can't sleep at night, and i can't function in the daytime.

it doesn't help that my neighbor is probably a cokehead and plays really loud music all the time.  The thing is, he has been living there for like 2 months and only in the past 3 weeks have i heard him.  but since that one big party the noise has been almost constant.  i don't get it.  i told him about the floorboards and the fact that i can hear music playing all the time, but he doesnt care.  the cops dont do anything.  my landlord doesnt do anything.  i am afraid of him.  i think that is why i am having crazy dreams about being chased by murderers...i know that he or one of his friends could wait in the basement until i walk in one night...scary!!!


he is pacing!!!  who paces!?!?!?!  that motherfucker.  a few minutes ago he was jumping and slamming his feet on the floor and my ceiling fan was violently shaking and my ceiling sounded like it was going to cave in.

i need to move ASAP.

i think i am going to tell my landlord to get this guy to shut up or let me break my lease with no consequences, financially.

i wish that old man still lived up there.  he was so silent.  i didnt even know he lived there.  and by old i mean like 45, maybe.  the new guy is like 35 and thinks he is a fucking college student."

"event","I'm listening to dave matthews band for the first time in probably 6 months.

I'm teaching myself guitar again because my finger has healed enough that I can play.

I'm going back to school.

I'm writing again.&nbsp; Not here, but I am.&nbsp; or will be as of this moment on.

The program to which i am applying is a master's of the arts in book publishing.&nbsp; Basically, it is half creative writing (like an MFA) and half classes pertaining to the publishing industry.&nbsp; Through it i gain a more thorough knowledge of my craft, practical knowledge, and editorial experience.&nbsp; I am submitting my application to Portland State on the 15th, and soon thereafter sending in my English department application and portfolio.&nbsp; So I have got to get working on some old pieces, and bring them up to grad school standards.

I could sure use some help.&nbsp; If you are interested in just reading some of my pieces (they are all short, and take a max of 10 min to read) and just simply give me feedback, i would love you forever.&nbsp; Let me know, and I will email a few to you.&nbsp; Or if you are Alicia, I will send about 10 at once:)

BEcause of the fall I had early last sunday morning I went to the hospital.&nbsp; I was in so much pain I couldn't do anything or concentrate.&nbsp; So they did an exam and xrays, and decided that it iwas just a huge bruise putting way too much pressure on my ribcage.&nbsp; So I have these anti-pain anti-inflamatories that I am supposed to take twice a day.&nbsp; and NOT drink while i am on them.&nbsp; fuck.&nbsp; that means that sunday, i will skip them so i can BEAR DOWN.

This guy at work was playing the original bear down song all day today.&nbsp; It was hilarious (for a while) because it was written proibably in the 40s or something.&nbsp; really hokie.

tomorrow i am going out to elgin for the remainder of the weekend to visit rach and see her new apartment.&nbsp; So tonight i get to stay in, dope myself up on painkillers and do laundry.&nbsp; sounds fun, huh?

we are going to go to best buy, buy food (a cheese plate, pizza rolls, alcohol, good salsa, and plenty more crappy food that tastes great).&nbsp; and then we are going to go party, and then have a superbowl party on sunday.&nbsp; and then i get to work bright and early monday.

starting monday i am going back to veganism.&nbsp; i need to in order to control my weight.&nbsp; Because of my fall, i basically can't work out for a few weeks.&nbsp; and then i am hardcore pilate-ing daily, and running when weather permits.&nbsp; i can't freaking wait."

anyways, i emailed a few of my favorite professors these reallly realllllly long emails about this program I discovered.&nbsp; my fave writing prof emailed me back this short reply :

""this is a fabulous program.
you rock""

Oh, Heather, how I miss your terse wisdom!

"event","For the first time in my life, i called the cops for a noise violation.

This is after I went upstairs at 5:20 and asked&nbsp;my 30-something neighbor&nbsp;to keep the noise down, and fell down the stairs, and talked to alicia, and then my parents, left about 4 voicemails with my landlord (a chicago cop, ironically) and watched the first 45 min of almost famous.&nbsp; at 7:15 the noise was much louder than a dull roar -- it seemed the party was gaining momentum rather than slowing down.&nbsp; So i called and non-anonymously placed a noise violation complaint.&nbsp; i even went outside (again) to prop open the gate so the cops could get in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sweet victory was mine, as the cops banged on the door, and I heard the music go from about a 50 on a scale of 1-10 to a 2 before my neighbor opened the door.&nbsp; Muffled&nbsp;speech was&nbsp;exchanged, and things settled down.

I guess it was a premature victory, however, because 10 minutes later the noise level was the same.&nbsp; i waited, hoping that the noise would die down, as it was then 7:45.&nbsp; Of course, this has to be the worst day ever.&nbsp; So i called my landlord, left another angry message. &nbsp;right when I hung up, my phone rang.&nbsp; Landlord.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The moral of the story is, I no longer feel like an asshole when the noise has been persistent for 3 hrs and I call the cops.&nbsp; SO THERE.


Sleep, however, is a lost cause.&nbsp; So I'm eating breakfast, and going to go do laundry in a few minutes.&nbsp; and in a little while, when everything gets quiet, i am going to go upstairs and wake everybody up:)"

And this is exactly as they are. no edits, no spelling or grammar corrections, and no omissions... <br /><i><br />the floor pulses. base drum beats on the surface lights flashing, arms raising. floaring to the beat. hips shake. low rumbles of chords echo engulfed in sound. eyes meet - faces connect drawn towards fire, smoky glances. sweat glistens, bodies meet. waves of motion as the base beats. pattersn emerge - diverge, repeat. lyrics fade and then its just the pulse, radiating in the darkness.</i>&nbsp;<br /><br />unchaparoned children<br />half-throwing suitcases<br />they almost fall before<br />resting on the rack.<br /><br />up and down - unpacking<br />repacking.&nbsp; precariously<br />unbalancing teetering<br />towards seattops<br />and passengers.<br />disaster awaits.<br /><br /><em>10 May 2006 11:47pm<br /><br />On Sunday I graduated from college -- I concluded a four-year attention span and all I got for it was a complementary 8oz bottle of water, a blue with orange lining folder containing a letter provisionally stating that my diploma would arrive in a few weeks, and a half inch in diameter pin labeling me as a graduate, as a Hope College alum.&nbsp; And I got $150 in graduation money from the grandparents and a classical acoustic guitar from M&amp;D.&nbsp; So I took some of my grad money and bought this journal because I think it will make me want to write and it has <u>NO LINES</u>, so I can write as big or little as I want, and even upside down or sideways or diagonally if I want.&nbsp; The cubs have been on an 8-game skid, and I have high hopes for the game that is on right now.&nbsp; It's 8-1 cubs.&nbsp; So we'll see.&nbsp; for the past two days I have been moving in to this new house.&nbsp; No more brenna, no more old upstairs hot apartment.&nbsp; This house is big, and so is my room.&nbsp; and the walls are blue.&nbsp; I'm living, right now, with a bunch of people I don't know.&nbsp; let's hope everything goes well.&nbsp; Tomorrow I am actually going to attend a tulip time event on purpose -- Lisa and I&nbsp; are going to the parade and eating crappy carnival food.&nbsp; Should be a hoot.&nbsp; Whomever painted this room did a terrible job.&nbsp; There's blue paint drips on the corners of the carpet and on the white moulding, and arround the windows and power outlets are strips of white.&nbsp; Whoops.&nbsp; back to the game I go...'til next time.<br /></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />When I was in elementary school, when my excema on my hands got really really bad and cracked and bled, my mom used to put hydrocortizone cream on the backs of my handes to try to heal them.&nbsp; I always make her put the cream on my hands because it smelled bad and I didnt want the stuff touching the front of my hands or my fingers.<br /><br />We played imaging games using monopoly pieces as our treasure and pool balls as huge gems.&nbsp; We removed the opally-white pearly screw covers on the pool table and popped them back in, over and over again, to feel the points on the back and to hear the popping noise.&nbsp; When balls got stuck in the trays that fed to the front ball collector we shook the track to make them move.<br /><br />I would wake up really early on Saturdays, and during holidays, and read while the sun rose, trying my hardest not to have to pee, for fear that mom and dad would catch me and make me eat breakfast or start my chores.&nbsp; I got allowance on Saturdays.&nbsp; It was pretty cheap.&nbsp; I think it was 10 cents per year of age, and extra for certain chores.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That is enough for now, i think.<br /><br />"

I think I need to rethink my life.  I never settle -- so I never stay at a job or apartment long enough to get comfortable.  I want to live one the ocean.  NYC or Cali.  I want to edit documents all day.  Is that weird?

Maybe I should just go for a piercing apprentiship or something, so I can go where I want to go and live how I want to live.  And then move to Europa."

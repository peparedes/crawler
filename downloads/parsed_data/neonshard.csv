So why dose it matter wakeing up in an empty house. With not even a note or a card left wishing you happy birthday."

<lj-cut text=""Political Cows"">
SOCIALISM:
You have 2 cows and you give one to your neighbour.

COMMUNISM:
You have 2 cows; the Government takes both and gives you some milk.

FASCISM:
You have 2 cows; the Government takes both and sells you some milk.

NAZISM:
You have 2 cows. The Government takes both and shoots you.

AN AMERICAN CORPORATION:
You have two cows. You sell one, and force the other to produce the milk of four cows. Later, you hire a consultant to analyze why the cow dropped dead.

A FRENCH CORPORATION:
You have two cows. You go on strike because you want three cows.

A JAPANESE CORPORATION:
You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. You then create a clever cow cartoon image called Cowkimon and market them Worldwide.

A GERMAN CORPORATION:
You have two cows. You reengineer them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and milk themselves.

AN ITALIAN CORPORATION:
You have two cows, but you don't know where they are. You break for lunch.

A RUSSIAN CORPORATION:
You have two cows. You count them and learn you have five cows. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 2 cows. You stop counting cows.

A SWISS CORPORATION:
You have 5000 cows, none of which belong to you. You charge others for storing them.

A CHINESE CORPORATION:
You have two cows. You have 300 people milking them. You claim full employment, high bovine productivity, and arrest the newsman who reported the numbers.

AN INDIAN CORPORATION:
You have two cows. You worship them.

IRAQI CORPORATION:
Everyone thinks you have lots of cows. You tell them that you have none. No one believes you and they bomb your ass. You still have no cows, but at least now you are part of a Democracy....

SURREALISM:
Surrealism: You have two giraffes. The government requires you to take harmonica lessons

HONG KONG CAPITALISM:
You have 2 cows. You sell 3 of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all 4 cows back, with a tax deduction for keeping 5 cows. The milk rights of 6 cows are transferred via a Panamanian intermediary to a Cayman Islands company secretly owned by the majority shareholder, who sells the rights to all 7 cows' milk back to the listed company and proceeds from the sale are deferred. The annual report says that the company owns 8 cows, with an option on one more. Meanwhile, you kill the 2 cows because the feng shui is bad

Logic tells me that its probly a group of foxes fighting, as they make strange noises.
But my minds to creative and tired to focause on logic, so my brain tells me theres ether a horrid crime being comited, or a chemical in the air which is starting to turn people to vombies and thats there inhuman crys.

"event","<b>Right so what dose your screan name mean, is there a story behind it?</b>
<i>NeonShard</I>
The first bit is simple. Neon being a gameing clan i am in and that my freinds run. It only gose it as just 'shard' is normaly taken.
Now Shard the more intresting name.
For its story im going to use imagory...
Now imagion you've just throw a glass agenst a wall in rage/upset <i>(i've done this today  shhh, mother need never know)</i>. The glase breaks in to shards, dose it not. A shard is a broken, yet in being broken it is so bueatiful (imagion the uneven surface of a glass shard as they reflect the light). A shard is small and delicate looking, to beak it is so easy. Yet everyone worrys about a shard, (think how cairfuly broken glass is cleaned up) as we all know it cuts easly.
So this is the meaning od my name, which reflects quite alot about what i see in my reflection.
<i>broken, bueatiful, fragial, violent </i>

<b> its not often i do these things but this one, i just had to good an image to pain to miss up.</B>"

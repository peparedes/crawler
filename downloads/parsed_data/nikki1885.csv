"event","So on Monday I have an interview to get into the radiology program at HCC and I am so nervous about it because if I don't get in then I don't know what I'm going to do. It sucks because there is no one that I can really talk to who really understands. Everyone can say ""you'll be fine and you'll get in"" but it still makes me nervous. There is always someone that is better than you. That's the part that scares me the most. In a couple weeks this will all be over and I'll finally know once and for all if I'll have to choose another career or not..."

"event","A heart as pure as gold.
Meanness not in your soul.
A smile for everyone, even me.
I could just call out your name,
and you'd be there.
I made the mistake of loving you,
and God took you away,
but now I know he only takes the best.
Just looking at your picture
reminds me of that.
I wish I could see you one more time
so I could say I love you
and goodbye.
And to tell you that when God
took you away from me,
a piece of me died that day."

I hadn't been in so long so we took a guess and we were right! lol. After we had been there for a little while we had lunch at a seafood restaurant that was really good. We still had a lot of time to kill until the Red Sox game, so we decided to go to the aquarium. That was pretty cool because I had never been there before. After that it was about time to go to the game so we took the T to Fenway. It was such a great day. To top it all off... the Red Sox won!!! It was the best trip to Boston that I had ever had!!!"

I got a new sweater, a sweatshirt, and the movie March of the Penguins from Adam. <3 I love that movie eventhough it's a documentary, but it doesn't seem like that when you watch it. The baby penguins are the cutest thing ever! I also got a new purse from my sister which I love, movie passes from my brother and scratch tickets which I lost on. It was a really good birthday! I got everything that I wanted. I can't believe that Christmas is in a few weeks! I'm only half way through my christmas shopping. I still have about 4 or 5 more people to shop for and those are the hardest people to shop for. I have to get really creative!!! But I have to say that this is my favorite time of the year!!!"

I'm hoping that it will be quick and painless because I'll be out at 3. I really wish that things didn't always end up the same way on the weekend. I end up doing the same thing every single day... I would much rather hang out with my friends, who I don't get to spend as much time with because of school and work. But that's going to change very soon. Vacation is coming and I'm not going to sit home and do nothing I'm going to go out and enjoy every single day no matter what happens. I really hate school right now!!!

I haven't accomplished anything great and I probably never will. I go to college where I am majoring in liberal arts... what am I going to do with that? I feel like I'm walking on earth just taking up space that someone who has ambition to do something with their life deserves. I feel that at this point in my life I am never going to amount to anything and that I'll go through life never finding my true calling. For most people it's no problem fromt he moment that they are born, they know exactly what they want to do. As for me I can't say that same."

I couldn't even find it so I had to look around for it.

The only thing that I wanted to see were the hatching baby chicks. They were so cute! I also had my first Maine baked potato. It was good... I never had one from the Maine building before because the line was always so crazy but it wasn't too bad the other day. School has been okay lately... it would be so much better if I didn't have to write any type of paper ever! All the assignments that my teachers have given me to write about are completely stupid and have absolutely no point. They're just a huge waste of time. At least I don't have to start writing the longer ones for about another month or so. I can't wait til it's all done for another semester. I have to say though that going three days a week is much better than 5. The week goes by so much faster!"

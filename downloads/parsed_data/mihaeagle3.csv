"event","well i finaly got my laptop back...heres what has happened since:

last weekend went to little rock for some ice games.  won them 10 or 11-0 to like 6-2 or so. i scored like 6 times and got a few assists during the whole thing...along with 4 penalties and a bunch HUGE ass hits...the ones where everyone is like damn...that was a huge ass hit.
the second morning when i got to the rink and got to the locker room and put on my pants people were talking about me and my assets...
then after like a minute of thinkn what the hell? this kid walked in who is picked on at school all the time and shit...he sat next to me and we talked and shit and i showed him a scar that he gave me the night before from a hornet...and he said ""well look at this"" and pulls the sleeve on his shirt back and showed me this giant cut where he cut himself...he told me he did this before every big game to get his blood flowing...yeah...his reason: (the quote for like all sports) give blood, play hockey

monday we had an inline game. we had to forfit cause we didnt have enough people...my stick is broken now...a 180 dollar stick i got just this summer is broken...

exams all this week...wasnt bad

haircut...people say it looks better...i dont think its that bad but i want it long again

i have practice for ice tonight...and tomorow morning...on my birthday...joy...then i get to go guitar shopping for my 5 string

thats about all"

"event","well today just sucked fuckin donkey dick...first off i DID wake up at fuckin 5 in the mornin...but couldnt stay up...missed practice...never good to miss the first practice of the season. then i was awakend by chris asking to go to ts house so i went down to his house and said ""shit i forgot your game and controler...so i rode back up and on this jump i always have to turn into, and have fallen on before when it was wet and not too long ago either, i fuckin bit it...i cut my hand in the same fuckin place i did last time and skidded like a foot this time cause i quickly hopped up...it sucked fuckin ass and hurt like hell...i have skin comin off a few places, scraped up my sholder and my hip and i think i got one of the like 12 infected...after that we went to ts and the damn thing wouldnt stop bleeding...not like gushing out but it was like...bloody...so i stayed there for a few hours and ate way too much...came back...what happens? i get someone pissed at me and have probably lost their trust...fuck...even with that going on, my hand wouldnt stop bleeding...i now have this little spot on my laptop where i rest my hands where it was bleeding...the bleeding did stop and now its mostly puss...yeah...its interesting......i use these:.... things way to fuckin much...

after that i had to go to the half shell to eat with my sister and parents...i couldnt get what i wanted or anything...but there was this group of INCREDIBLY hot chicks sitting across from me...we kept exchanging looks and on our way out i winked...im such a looser...but i hope that left an impression. 

so over all today kinda sucked...no one is talking online...im bored as fuck...i cant play my bass like normal cause my fucking fingers are a little scaped up...im still trying though...i leard certain parts of 3 new songs today...all from the new (not really new anymore) blink 182 cd...not that hard though.

i have hockey 4 times this week i think...maby 5....game monday, inline practice tuesday, ice practice wednesday, possible inline practice thursday, and i think an ice practice saturday...joy...

i do have some good news though: my new tour skates are coming in in 5 days along with my new tight jock strap...ok so yall didnt need to know that last part but yeah....oh i cant wait...those things are gonna kick mother fuckin ass. like i said not too long ago my team plays lance hepners team monday...should be an interesting game cause they have 2 past travel team players that were on my team...come out and watch...ill give the people that do a dollar...or more...depending on how important you are to me

im feeling kinda sad and shit for no apparent reason...im gonna go do something worth while


if you made it this far...you have no life or have too much boredom"

monday night i had a game against little hepners team. we won 7-4 but it was supposed to be 8-4...i got 3 goals and 3 assists but i shoulda had 4 goals and 4 assists...on one they gave credit to my teamate who hit it back in the net after mine bounced back out. the ref sucked ass....he should have atleast given me an assist...so over all i got 3 goals and 3 assists...

yesterday sucked ass...sorta...in a certain way it did...i sprinted like a mile or less and ran the rest or somethin like that cause lance says from the gym to the school entrance its a mile or so but it doesnt really feel like a mile...maby were wrong...o well...anyway i was tired as fuck cause i sprinted on some parts cause i didnt know we had to do it again. to make things worse i had a burger and fries right before...after school i felt tired as fuck but my friend came over and we biked around for an hour or 2...we went to wallgreens and got some shit...we went to loris and we were riding around and i forgot i had practice at like 6 so i didnt care if i wore myself out or not...chris had to go home and i went back home and my mom said i need to hurry up...so i went to practice and we did a bunch of these skating ""warmup drills"" but the coach that was teaching them doesnt know shit so we didnt do them all corectly...and he doesnt know how to skate...he says you should bend over and lean into your path but that puts you off balance....after the team drills we had a scrimage which sucked more ass cause my team wont listen to a word i say so we lost 2-0...i lost my mother fuckin 100 dollar gloves so i couldnt get a feel with my stick...i hit the post 4 times....it SUCKED MOTHER FUCKIN ASS....

"event","I deleted my myspace finally. Cause I have no intentions of meeting new friends anymore and person I really get comments from is my brother and I live with him.

The cat and I are waatching Cosby show. Just got home from BN. I can't decide if I love it there or if I hate it. I depends on the day. I do love my music department family. 

Christmas was cool. I guess as you get older it gets less exciting. I wish Santa was real. That had to be the best part. I wish I still got Barbies and played with them all Christmas day. I read 400 pages of a book and ate all kinds of chocolate and got sick.

"event","So. Thursday I saw Angels and Airwaves. They were really good except for long interludes and this effect they had on Tom's voice and the fact that I couln't touch him... but I was in tears the whole time, because it was Tom Delonge. He was 20 feet away from me. It was glorious. Taking Back Sunday was AMAZING. Out of the four times I saw them that was easily the best show they've played. And Adam came back for an encore with his acoustic guitar and a harmonica. Like fucking Bob Dylan. Almost. Me and Sam danced to Head Automatica and we were the only ones moving and we kept telling all the kids to dance but they just looked at us like we were retarded. Oh well. It was sooo hot. Like 100 degrees and we waited in lines all day drneched in sweat (grooossss) and the car ride was long and hot because Brian's air conditioner decided it was only going to blow warm air. But over all it was amazing. I had fun. 
Friday I graduated. It was weird. And really hot again because the gowns are made out of like wool and polyester. It was exciting though and then we all went out to dinner and stuff. 
Yep. The end."

"event","Graduation. This friday.  I'm actually sort of excited about it. Idk. I'm more excited about Six Flags [Angels and Airwaves, Taking Back Sunday, Head Automatica] so I can ride the ferris wheel and be a teenie bopper and dance with my boyfriend. Tomorrow I'm going to a party at my dad's house for graduation/my birthday. Being 18 isn't different at all. It actually was the lamest birthday yet. Oh well. I'm excited about the camera I'm getting, that is if my dad pulled through. 

I need to re-schedule my road test. meehhhh.
Okay. Bye."

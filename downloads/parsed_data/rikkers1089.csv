THAT was my bad.. THAT wont happen again..lol..geez its like people think i cant grow up or im not capable of getting over things.. PPL.. IM OVER IT ALL..

I can have the greatest friends in the world..and we can hang out and have tons of fun.. but when they leave me.. and im all by myself thinkin to myself.. im miserable.. I have no happiness to show all the pain and misery ive been thru...i h8 to say it..but its all HIS fault.. U kno we cudnt be like other people and just get along after things went down hill..nope.. not us.. I had the greatest oppurtunity to run away from it all.. just get away from everyone..go to massachusetts with my dad...and i turned it down..y? so i cud sit here and be miserable..every...fricken...day.. thinking that maybe something will be worked out..a friendship.. a simple hello..how have ya been? Idk y im still here..shudnt i have learned that its not gunna happen.. happiness isnt gunna come to me..and now im too deep into everything to reconsider my oppurtunity..especially softball.. I mean.. i have to say thankyou to the friends that make me try and forget.. thanks paul and julie and stephanie and cj and anthony and ben and zack and mike and even tim and bryan inman lol and breanne and melanie and keari and candace..it was worth a shot..well... i think its about time to go soak myself in some of my own tears..nothing new.. bye everyone.."

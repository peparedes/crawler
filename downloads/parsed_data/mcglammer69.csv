"event","LAST NIGHT I WENT TO THE STUD.
THAT WAS LAME ALTHO THE MUSIC WAS REALLY GOOD.
I THEN WENT TO LONESTAR. WHERE I MET SOME COOL DUDES.



LETS REWIND FOR A MINUTE.


I GOT TO THE STUD. MY ROOMIE REBECCA WAS ALREADY A DRUNKEN FOOL. WE HAD SO SERIOUS TALKS.&nbsp; THEN THAT GOT LAME AND WE WENT TO THE LONESTAR. WHERE THE MUSIC WAS AMAZING (DAVID BOWIE/YEA YEA YEAS AND SOME COOL PUNK SHIT)&nbsp;
WE WENT ON THE BACK PATIO.... WERE TALKIN AND DRINKIN OUR BEER WHEN SOME GUYS CALLED ME OVER.&nbsp;
I GUESS THEY KNEW WHO I WAS FROM THE INTERNET. IT WAS KINDA WEIRD. I GUESS I AM TOO POPULAR FOR MY OWN GOOD. ONE OF THEM WAS REALLY CUTE. THE OTHER WAS CUTE TOO. AND THEN THERE WAS A AN UGLY BITCHY ONE WHO I IGNORED FOR THE MOST PART.
I ALSO RAN INTO THE HOTTTTEST GUY I HAVE MET SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE. HE WAS THERE AND WE TALKED AND SHIT. HE IS SUPER NICE AND I AM GLAD I SAW HIM. HE MADE MY NIGHT BETTER.

WE LEFT AROUND 1130 CUZ I HAD TO WORK TODAY (THATS WHERE I AM NOW) AND WE SAW SOME DRUNK GIRL WITH SOME GUY AND MY DRUNK ASS ROOMIE WANTED TO FOLLOW THEM AND ASK IF SHE WAS OK. I GOT MAD CUZ THIS IS SF NOT CANADA AND U CANT BE UP IN FOLKS BIZNESS.
WE WALKED BY THE EAGLE WHERE I GOT CRUISED BY SOME HOT DUDE. HE EVEN FOLLOWED US TO THE STREET CORNER BUT MY ASSHOLE ROOMATE STARTED ACTING DRUNKER THEN SHE REALLY WAS! AND SCARED HIM AWAY. MY BFF CALLED AND WE WERE TALKING AND MY ROOMIE WAS BEING A TOTAL ASSHOLE AND I GOT MAD AT HER AND TOLD HER I WAS GUNNA LEAVE HER IF SHE KEPT ACTING STOOOPID.
AND OF COURSE SHE DID BECAUSE SHE IS AN ALCHOHOLIC THAT CANT CONTROL HERSELF....
SO I TOLD HER TO FUCK OFF AND LEAVE ME BE OR I WOULD LEAVE HER IN THE MISSION TO GET KILLED.
I LEFT HER SKANK ASS WITH THE HOPES SHE MIGHT GET RAPED. I FIGURED THAT WOULD TEACH HER A LESSON.
BUT ABOUT 45 MINUTES AFTER I STUMBLED HOME SHE COMES CRASHING IN MAKING ALL KINDS OF NOISE AND OF COURE SHE HAS MORE BEER.
I HAD TO GET UP THIS MORNING AND GET TO WORK.
I AM HERE.
TIRED.
SHE IS PROLLY DRUNK AT HOME TALKING SHIT LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES.
AT THIS POINT. SHE IS DEAD TO ME.
ONE MIGHT ASK.... WHAT IS SHE SEE;S THIS? I DONT CARE CUZ SHE IS PROLLY TO DRUNK TO REALIZE WHAT ITS ABOUT!
2NITE THERE IS&nbsp;A PARTY AT MY HOUSE.
I DONT WANNA BE THERE.
SO....LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS!

"event","Carve your heart out yourself
Hopelissness is your cell
Since you've drawn out these lines
Are you protected from trying times?

Man, it takes a silly girl
To lie about the dreams she has
But lord, it takes a lonely one 
To wish that she had never dreamt them at all

Oh look now, there you go with hope again
Oh you're so sure that I'll be leaving in the end

Dig your ditch deep enough
To keep you clear of the sun
You've been burned more than once
You don't think much of trust

Oh look now, there you go with hope again
But I'll be sure your secret's safe with me
Oh you're so sure that I'll be leaving in the end
You're treating me like I'm already gone
But I'm not, I will star where you are, always

"event","so i think everything's going to be cool.  hali, if you read this, i really hope your cousins go for this whole idea & you end up liking the idea of moving out bc i'm kinda excited about this whole thing.  so for everyone else who is no doubt confused, hali & i may be rooming together along with her cousins nikki & (ok, so i forgot - sry hali).  anyhow, we were looking at apts. last night on rent.com & we saw one that i REALLY like & it would only be like 250ish each.  not bad.... ;-)  anyone wants to check it out the addy for the floorplan is : http://www.rent.com/property/floorplans/479802/2/1/595402/#content
isn't it nifty?  935 a month is the total cost, so even with utilities, it's still probably under 300 each.  ok, so maybe i'm a little too excited...  i still don't know for sure bc it depends on how long i can stand my parents & what comes up in everyone's lives, but in theory it's awesome.  lol.  so enough babble on that.

i can't wait to be done w/ school for the semester, but i'm so far behind.  right now the stress from that & the shitstorm that i'm sure is coming this weekend (i'm not sure yet what i did wrong, but i'm sure my parents will have found SOMETHING...) is a little too much.  but i have to come home.  i also have to call deb.  i'm supposed to do something w/ her this weekend, but i forgot to call her back last night.  oops.  so i'm going to call her now & then get ready to wander around outside in the cold.  bubye"

"event","at this very moment in time, for the first time since (probably) the summer, i can honestly say that i am truly content with everything.  this is definitely a good sign.  i think it means spring is almost here.

on a not so spacey note, i am entirely amped.  for anyone who doesn't know yet, i plan on coming home and attending good ol' lcc next year because i'm going to be a paralegal.  what is that you might say?  it's the person who does the bitch work for lawyers (looking up case law & writing briefs & stuff).  they can have other jobs too, but that's the one i want.  it looks like fun.  :-)  i can't wait to get out of where i'm at.  i'm gonna miss a few people here though...  but i get everyone else back!  :-)"

"event","you might think that's just a clever title for something deep that i'm about to write about...  but you'd be wrong.  the only thing that was deep was the freakin ravine that i was in when i fell.  ok, i suppose it's story time.  i'm in this stupid science class and we're starting an ecology investigation.  you might ask, ""how do you study ecology in the snow?""  and the answer is, ""you don't.  you look at trees.  and snow.  and more snow...""  so i spent two hours tramping through snow, up and down incredibly steep & slippery hills, and getting covered with snow.  so i had to cross this little creek thingy, right?  and it was only about 2 ft wide at the spot.  i should've been able to step over, no big.  but enough people had crossed at just that spot, that when i moved to step, i slid down the 3 ft bank and into the ice.  thin ice mind you, so it broke and i got two shoes full of water.  then i got to climb up about 50 yds of ravine walls.  it was fun.  let me tell you...  so that's my day.  off to yet another work mtg...  :-P"

"event","so i'm having a pretty good time up here at gvsu...  josh came to see me.  he let me cut his hair.  stop laughing!  no really!  knock it off!  i swear it turned out pretty good! anyhow, so i had lots of fun because i love my josh. :-)

however, i want to apologize to like everyone who i ever made feel like a third wheel.  my roommate got a new boyfriend and they are so cute together.  but now i know how everyone else feels.  lol.  o well.  it's cool though because they're happy.

so i still don't want to go to work.  it seems like every time i write i'm on my to work or just got back & i'm never happy about it.  lol.  maybe i should find a new job.  i should finish my fruity pebbles before i leave."

"event","so i don't know who all has noticed, but i don't like to get up early and be constantly on the go.  especially when it's stuff i don't really want to do.  i much prefer to sit on my ass all day.  but that's not an option.  especially not today.

i got up at 6:30 this morning (and said screw that & slept another half hour) so i could be to work at 8.  am.  (there should only be one 8 in a day - this was definitely the wrong one).  bitching aside for the moment, i got around & went to work.  it kinda sucked, but at least the people are cool.  so i got out at noon and came back to my cubbyhole for lunch.

while sitting in my cubbyhole, i opened a b-day card from danielle (THANK YOU!!!).  in it were two very awesome pictures of my josh.  they made me smile.  so of course i had to call him.  i think i surprised him.  :-)

i had class at one.  it's a science class, but it's the damn coolest science class i've ever had.  we got to play with marshmallows and talk about birds and dinosaurs today.  seriously though, it's like everything you learned in elementary and middle school science compressed into one semester, only it's focused on how to teach it... kinda...  but it's fun stuff.

so at 4, when class ended, i walked back to my cubby for a quick dinner before i had to catch the bus (in the FREEZING cold) for my 6 o'clock class.  that was my diversity in education class.  tonight, the professor's goal (i swear on anything you want), was to make us uncomfortable.  he even said so.  lol.  it was funny though.  and for the first time, on the way back, the bus ride didn't suck.  i sat next to some decent people.  one of them graduated a year ahead of me from okemos.  we talked about the fabled ""mcdonald's in the cafeteria"" & ""sinking building"".  i found out the  highschool IS actually sinking, but for anyone who didn't know - there is no mcdonald's (or subway or any other fast food place) in their cafeteria.  lol.

after i got back i talked to josh on his lunch for a couple minutes and you'd think my day would be about over, but oooooh noooo...  i still had my java city meeting (work).  so i went BACK to work to sit and listen to MORE people talk at me for half an hour.  i got paid though, so i forgive them.  so now my day is finally over.  it was loooooooooong.  o well."

"event","i have officially had the coolest past few days ever.  work rocked on friday.  i worked with jasmine (a girl that i worked with a lot last semester), & we joked & had fun & shit.  so i came back and talked to josh (as always!  i love it!), and then went to bed.  i got up uber early and came home.  i got to celebrate my birthday twice because i go to like the only school in the state that has class on mlk jr. day.  grrr.  but it was fun.  we went to blue gill grill & played pool & ate dinner.  (i had a philly steak & cheese sandwich... yummy!)  then my parents gave me presents & we ate cake and ice cream.  i love cake :-)  i got learning to knit stuff.  now i can make a blanket or something :-)

so sunday i kinda putzed around.  it was cool though.  josh & my dad work on josh's car bc some dipshit at josh's work popped the lock & broke into it.  if i find them...  grrr... but it was cool.  so then i came back.  i got to talk to autumn on the way back.  i like driving her.  it's such a boring drive with no one to talk to.  and josh followed me back.  :-)  (surprise! lol)

then yesterday was (dun-da-da-dun) my birthday.  it was quiet.  i had class.  class was actually pretty cool.  i played teacher's pet in my science class (what's new, huh?), and when i came back, josh had made me a cake!  it was awesome.  it tastes yummy too.  i love my josh.  and i had my history class yesterday.  much to my amazement, it's seriously cool.  after class josh & i went out to dinner.  awesome awesome weekend.

so today, i skipped class.  i didn't feel like going.  i know it's waaaaaay to early for me to pull this shit.  o well.  no more.  i promise.  ok, so at least for a while.  it's ok though, because molly & i went to the fieldhouse to work out!  be proud of me!  hey!  stop laughing!  :-(  i feel good though.  so in a few hours, i'll have people over for spaghetti.  yummy!"

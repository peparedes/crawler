"event","<center>Well I wasn't planning on getting a roommate when I move out in Jan for school, but an old friend was looking for someone to move with around that time. I have to have a male roommate I can't seem to live with women. He got out of prison about a year ago (DUIs nothing too serious) But I've known him since 2005 and we don't hang out a lot which is deff the people you should live with. So yeah now bills will be cheaper. He wants to move a little more west than where I was looking but it's still hella close to school. Plus my fam would feel better with me living with someone in that area. And he's been doing work as a tat artist since he got out that could be either amazing or lead to me getting some stupid shit when im wasted.

It's been doing this off and on for 6 months now. But it's so intermittent that its not that big of a deal but it could get worse. I have a few months left on my warranty but I have also already called about the problem so it's on record. My comp just won't wake from sleep. It will show my mouse arrow and just a black background no matter how much I move it it doesn't change. I have re-installed my BIOS and re-installed my OS. The last guy I talked to said try those things and if it still does it you'll need to send it in to be diagnosed and replaced/repaired. Thing is it's an intermittent problem, they could have my computer for months....."

Hell No. I have 5 fucking huge projects due on Monday. I still haven't written my stuff for Art History which I'll have to do today and then start on the bitches projects. And she still has my binder which has all my stuff in it. I had to dig through half the internet just to find her email address because she doesn't use the one the school provides for her so its not listed on their site. Seriously this woman is going to be the death of me. I try really hard on a project I get like no points. I slap one together really fast and sloppy and get an A.... 

Gotta tidy up the room since the carpet cleaners will be here today and I've got school shit EVERYWHERE. Maybe I'll just go on my never ending journey to find primary yellow acrylic paint and a 3/4"" acrylic brush. Been to 8 art stores they have all run out or try to sell me the yellow that says its primary but clearly has a white tint to it which she will not accept."

Wow so that was a fun phone call to get at 3:30 in the morning. Ronnie's mom called freaking out saying someone was shot at their work. Come to find out the guy who relives Ronnie brought a gun to work and shot a co-worker. Ronnie's mom is still at work they're telling everyone they need to finish their shifts. I can kinda understand that since they make the bread for all of Arizona Nevada and California but still the guy was shot 3 times once in the arm the shoulder and finaly the head. 

Dont know if Ronnie's gonna be going back to work for a few days considering his entire department has crime scene tape."

<font color=""3366FF"" face=""veranda"" size=""5"">DJ ENRIE</font>
<font color=""3366FF"" face=""veranda"" size=""3"">(LA, 93.9 , MOONSHINE RECORDINGS)</font>
<img src=http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q42/djucan/enrie_lg.jpg>
<font color=""3366FF"" face=""veranda"" size=""2"">Nominated for Industry Insider's 1996 Commercial DJ of the Year, power mixer DJ Enrie turns up the heat all year round. A gifted high-powered DJ, Enrie continues to captivate the dance community with a never-ending mix of his passion for the turntables and his lust for house music.

Born in Queens, New York, Enrie moved to southern California in 1988. He quickly created a foundation for himself in the industry while working at American Trax Record Pool and working the clubland scene throughout Los Angeles. 

Befriending two DJs, Richard ""Humpty"" Vission and Tony B. who had mixshows on L.A.'s Power 106 FM proved to be most beneficial for Enrie's budding career. As their stars rose, Vission and Tony B. were required to travel quite regularly. They soon enlisted Enrie's mixing talents to fill in while they were out of town. With his rising noteriety as a house savvy innovator Enrie was also collaborating with Vission on the ""Power Tools"" show. Enrie subsequently proved his talents were far more worthy of a regular position at the station and his signature mid-day mix show ""Power Workout"" was born. 

The success of the two ""Power"" shows helped Enrie give underground house music a broad-based audience. His signature ""Power Workout"" was the springboard to the rising influence of House music in Los Angeles. It was this versatility that earned him remixing work with Amber, Frankie Cutlass and Nina Lares. 

Enrie took advantage of the latest of musical trends by successfully releasing a series of mix CD's on labels such as PR Records, Priority and Underground Construction. In 1988, after creating a new studio for himself, Enrie released his most hi-tech mix compilation, ""Inside My Mind,"" on Main Source Records. This double packet featured an interactive multi-media CD which included his music video, background information, games, tour dates, a special interview as well a virtual mixer, allowing fans be the ""DJ."" 

Enrie has found a home for his House at Moonshine Music. His 1999 debut release ""Turn It Up"" featured 17 tracks of cutting edge hard house with a relentless tempo. Mid-Summer 2000 was prime time for ""Turn It Up 2"", a compilation reflecting the hard bangin', body movin' house Enrie had been throwing down in the clubs. ""Keeping it real and staying true to my fans is what it's all about"", says Enrie. 

On his latest effort, ""Welcome to the Mix Show, "" Enrie showcases his hard-bangin', body-movin' House selections as well as his newest single, ""Gimme Funk,"" which Moonshine Music will release on vinyl as part of an artist deal.

From his humble beginnings at American Trax, Enrie worked his way up to ""Power Tools,"" on to his signature ""Power Workout"" show, all the while building a loyal audience of devoted fans.

<font color=""9933CC"" face=""veranda"" size=""2"">From his start as a DJ nearly a decade ago, Cloudskipper has been a leader in the 
North American hardcore music scene. His rise to become one of the most popular 
and anticipated hardcore djs and producers is especially prevalent in his live sets, 
taking you on a journey through the various sub-genres he manipulates.
Having toured all over the world in almost every major city in the US, Canada, and 
England, with several releases on labels such as Raw Elements, KFA, Supernova, 
and Bedlam, it's no wonder Cloudskipper continues to take hardcore and its

<font color=""666633"" face=""veranda"" size=""2"">There is definitely something about Jayvon. From the moment the LA based DJ started handing out mix CDs at underground raves he was destined for success. In just a few short years, he has gone from relative obscurity to playing alongside DJ Craze and making an appearance at the Winter Music Conference..s ultra-exclusive World of Drum and Bass party.
His success is a no brainer really since Jayvon is blessed with impeccable turntable skills, boundless energy, poster boy good looks and a humble demeanor. With a slew of mix CDs to his name, J is poised to take the drum and bass community by storm. With the release of his brand new mix compilation Electric he again steps up his game dropping a mix of eclectic tracks guaranteed to rock any dancefloor. Urban Breakbeat was so impressed by ..Electric.. that we knew Jayvon had to be on our site. We were able to catch up with him to discuss his past, present and bright future. This is the new generation of American drum and bass, so get ready!</font>

"event","<center>Me and Scotty Scorpion just had a duel. He decided to hang out on the ceiling right outside the bedroom door. So I waited, and waited, knowing if I knocked him down he would take off very quickly. Ronnie brought me up some poison before he headed off to work. I started spraying, got him a few good times which stunned him. All the while Benadict was walking around jumping on the wall meowing trying to get to him. Finanly he fell and my white phatpharm was the last thing he saw.

The stand is now.

its $475 but I fucking love it. I want some longer necklaces the Tiffany's choker I have just seems so high school to me now.

"event","<center><b>Live Rattlesnakes Released In 'Snakes On A Plane' Theater</b>

Two live diamondback rattlesnakes were released in an Arizona movie theater during a showing of the new film ""Snakes on a Plane,"" according to Local 6 News.

Authorities said pranksters released the young venomous rattlesnakes in a dark theater at the AMC Desert Ridge near Tatum and Loop 101 in Phoenix.

The two snakes caused a panic in the dark theater, according to the report.

""That to me is very scary,"" herpetological association representative Tom Whiting said. ""I would hate to be watching a movie about snakes and have a rattlesnake bite me.""

Wranglers were called to collect the snakes, the report said.

No one was injured in the incident and, so far, the culprits have not been caught.Officials believe the snakes were smuggled into the theater in backpacks.

""This thing is under someone's chair and they go to sit and they just push your foot in the air and startle it -- obviously all they got to do is startle this thing,"" Phoenix Herpetological Society spokesman Daniel Marchand said. ""It's dark. They can't see you, you know that well. If it's scared, boom it strikes.""

The snakes were released into the desert."

After hearing this news I made myself sick yet again. I want to change my major, but in order to do that I need to change schools. Cause AIPX doesnt offer photography.

Oddly enough they're adam's old ones. He told me just to deduct $100 that he owes me. I learned on these so it makes my life that much easyer.

I do need to buy needles and cartriges and a mixer and headphones. Adam found me a mixer for 30 bucks its a total POS but it works. Lots of people are giving me records they dont play anymore or just sick of. It makes me happy. Everytime I look at them I smile."

I'm only like a quarter of the way done, I only got the outline of one wing. Still need to go back for the shading and the whole other wing. It ended up not being free cause this thing is huge and hand drawn. $400 a wing is kinda steep but these guys are the best in the state, plus just this one outline has me in aww. Its some angel wings but theres places where they're missing feathers and you can see the bone and muscle tisiue. I'll get a pick once I can find someone to take one of it for me, cause its not working by myself very well."

I find Scott since he said he'd take me home, we went outside got in the car, spotted vic who scott already promised a ride to. I jumped out of the car and threw him in the backseat. I then called Heather cause she said she would be leaving in about 45 minutes. So I thought she missed it. I called. She had the kid who got stabbed in the backseat of her car on the way to the emergency room. The kid is fine, it didnt puncture anything. It was a typical case of lure the kid with the drugs into a space alone and beat him down take his stash and his money. Just never happend to that point before.

Okay heres whats new. Just today at in & out me and heather decided to throw a party together. I've had an idea for a party for like a year and we're using it. The parties name is ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and it is Wizard of Oz themed. 3 stages, we're still working on our 2 big headliners but other than that the lineup is nearly full. Its amazing how cheep this is gonna be. $400 total for 3 stages of great sound, 10 cabnets per stage *drool*. Wearhouse is gonna be no more than $200, we're gonna pay a few of the local dj's, most wont take money from me or heather. Then the headliners, one is $1000 he's so worth it though and the other we're still not sure. I've been busy doing that today and getting my internet set up. I've already got an image for the flyer so that is covered. I'm going to bed now. the Flock meeting kinda drained me I was laughing so much."

"event","I'll sell my soul to see you again
Whats the point when your my heaven
Memories of your smile keeps me going
But the pain in my heart keeps on growing
Im an empty vacume when your not near me

Time on the road has taught me a lesson
Singing for fun and money are different
Missing my friends and missing my loved ones
When im in bed at night i couldnt be more alone
Im a wreck until i hear the ring of the phone

When im away do you stay faithful
Does time apart make you more greatful
Is the love in your heart growing each moment
All of this love is making me ill
As the rain falls down so does my tears

When i get home ill ask you a question
I'll be down on one knee and in my best clothes
Look up at your beauty and wait for the answer
And if you say no ill cut off my airway
Slowly pass out right at your feet
If i have my way ill never wake up
Because you're the only reason that i keep breathing
You're the only reason that i keep breathing
Thats right, i said
You're the only reason that i keep breathing."

"event","So what am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled  

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy will do
Making up a few false rumors or two  

That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy 
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say 

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout louder!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down 

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will   So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing
Call me whatever cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing   

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore   

I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it and the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing   

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
What do we do girls?
Shout louder!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down   Lil' Kim:
Check it - Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can either give us some head, sex her off
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the table's about to turn
I'll bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back   

But you're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big 
To make up for small lil' things
So you're just a little boy
All you'll do is annoy
You must talk so big 
To make up for small lil' things   

This is for my girls...
This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout louder!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

but they cant stop themselves.
a simple friendship
with no strings attached ...
no reason to hold anything back.
always there for eachother
for anything and everything.
there to smoke a bowl
& pop open the bottle of captains
to forget our problems
for just a moment in time, 
maybe for just that one night.

she would have never thought 
a friendship like theirs could be
anything more or anything else.
shes seen the world through his set of eyes
just like he has looked through hers
and togehter its believed that something there is special
to that of what is unknown.

but she believes that things happen for a reason;
whats meant to happen will happen.
make the most of the moment
cuz all thats left tomorrow will be the memeories.
she wants to thank him for all the memories
and would like to thank him for being there.
they will always be friends
but they cant stop themselves.
its a simple friendship,
but the best and closest at that.
they cant stop themselves 
beacuse things happen for a reason.
whats meant to happen will happen.
so with that
lets smoke a bowl
and pop open the bottle of captains
and lets forget out problems again,
even if just for that moment in time,
even if its just for that one night.

they'll awlays be friends.....
but they can't stop themselves."

never stop,watch, and say what if
without fighting and giving a try.
don't wait for things to come to you
while you just sit around and hope.
because the experience of love and life
is greater than any feeling you could cope.
live in the moment and don't be afraid
to make a risk and take a chance.
don't always worry about whose watching;
step outside your shoes and dance.
experience isn't what happens to you,

"event","in my justice and law class we recently had a discussion about abortion.  yes, its a hugely debated subject, and there are many viewpoints that people have.  mostly everyone in my class was yelling, ""abortion should be legal!!"" these same people said that the reason it should be legal is because a teenager that has a baby; their life would be ruined. they argued, ""if they had sex and were safe and used a condom and it broke, that is no ones fault you should be allowed to get an abortion,"" or ""you got drunk at a party and were taken advantage of and were raped.""  i cant say that i have no compassion for these stories, but if you look at all their arguments, they all revert back to making a choice and taking a risk; they all go back to responsibility.  yeah, you were practicing safe sex and all using a condom, and yeah it sucks that it broke, but still, having sex in the first place is a chance.  the only way you will 100% not have sex is if you dont have sex. it is a huge consenquence, but reality is, you did choose to have sex.  same with if you go to a party.  you choose to have a drink, or two or three or ten.  it scary but all the time there are people putting pills into your drink or just flat out raping you.  then you wake up the next day having no idea what happened, and even worse no idea who you were with or if you got raped who did it to you.  no one forces you to go to a party.  no one forces you to have those drinks.  no one forced you to have sex even though you used a condom... 

but the only only only exception is rape. rape is a HUGE horrible awful problem in our socitey.  it happens so often and it is a terrible thing that some unfortunate women/teens/even girls have to go through. if a female is raped i believe that they should be allowed to get an abortion if they feel that is what they want.  there is no reason that they would have to get abused and tortued like that and then have to live with a result of that torture for the rest of their life, again if that is so what they chose to do. 

its argued that it would be better for a child to not be born at all than it would be for them to be born into a poor, single teenage mom.  its argued that these children that are born will end up on the streets or in orphanages or foster care.  again this is unfortunated, but i argue that everyone has a chance.  everyone has an opportunity to make something of themselves and their lives; that is if their living situation isnt abusive.... but then again child abuse is a problem with children all over the world. its a problem with families that purpously have four or any amount of kids.  back to my point, you can alwyas make something of your life.  in our world there are so many successful, even famous people that now have fantastic careers, a wonderful home, and great families that were born by a teenage mom and then were directly placed into an orphange.  

my father is an example of one of those people. he was born to a lady at a very young age.  he has never met his birth mother, doesnt know her name, and couldnt tell you anything about her appearance. she is and was never any part of his life.  he was adopted by the most unbelievly sweet and generous people, my grandma and grandpa.  these people raised him and were the best people in the world to him.  he was their son, and they were his parents.  growing up my dad told me that he never had much; his family never had much.  his dad worked a low paying, long hour, demanding job, and his mom just stayed at home like almost all wives and moms did back then. so my dad, unlike a lot of his friends, he was never able to play on his schools baseball team like all his friends did, becuase he just couldnt afford it.  he couldnt do a lot of things and never got a lot of gifts because his family just didnt have the money. my dad was a very intelligent boy growning up.  after high school he was accepted into quite a few colleges, including UW MAdison, as well as eau claire where most of his friends went.  but again, he couldnt go becuase his family couldnt afford it. instead my dad got a job and worked for a few years, then when he got enough money he enrolled and attended lakeland college.  unlike his sisters he grew up with, my dad is now a complete success, or he is in my eyes.  hes a sales manger for a major telephone company, TDS.  he lives in a great wonderful home, and i know the biggest and only really important thing in his life, he has the worlds best family.  

im proud of my dad for never giving up and making the most of his life.  he was given a chance by being given a chance to live.  i thank God for the lady that decided to have my dad and not get an abortion.  she gave me my father.  if it wasnt for her, i wouldnt even be here. 

here are the lyrics to one of my favorite songs. its by nick cannon and anthony hamilton and is titled, ""CAN I LIVE.""  i encourage you to read the lyrics and listen to the song. 

before you go argue your thoughts of abortion, really think about it.  take a look at the people around you.  you would be surprised how many of them were given a chance to live.  you would also be surprised to find out how many people you know have had an abortion and didnt decide to give someone a chance. i look at my dad, and i thank God he was given a chance to live.

thanks for listening.

CAN I LIVE
by Nick Cannon and Anthony Hamilton

Talking Ma
I know the Situation is Personal
but it something that has to be told
as i was making this beat
you was all i could think about you heard my voice

[Verse 1]
Yeah Just think Just Think
what if you could Just
Just blink your self away..
Just Just wait just pause for a second
Let me plead my case
Its the late 70's Huh
You Seventeen huh
and having me that will ruin everything huh
its alot of angel waiting for there wings
you see me in your sleep so you cant kill your dreams
300 Dollars thats the price of living what?
Mommy i dont like this clinic
hopefully you'll make the right decision
and dont go though with the Knife Decision
but it hard to make the right move
when you in high school
how you have to work all day and take night school
hopping off da bus when the rain is pouring
What you want morning sickness or the Sickness of morning

[Chorus]
I Will Always Be apart of you
Trust Your Soul Know His Heart Is True
If I Could Talk I Would Say To You
CAN I LIVE
CAN I LIVE
I Will Always Be apart of you
Trust Your Soul Know His Heart Is True
If I Could Talk I Would Say To You
CAN I LIVE
CAN I LIVE

[Verse 2]
I' am a child of the king
aint no need to go fear me
and i see the flowing tears so know that you hear me
when i move in your worn that's me being scaring
cause who knows where my future holds
yo the truth be told you aint told a soul
yo you aint even showing i just 2 moths old
thorough your clothes try to hide me deny
me went up 3 sizes
your pride got you lying saying aint nothing but a migraine
it aint surprising you not trying to be in wick food lines
your friends look at you funny but look at you mommy
thatz a life inside you look at your tummy
what is becoming ma i am Oprah bound
you can tell he's a star from the Ultrasound
Our Sprits Connected Doors Open Now
Nothing But Love And Respect Thanks For 
Holding Me Down She Let Me Live...

[Chorus]
I Will Always Be apart of you
Trust Your Soul Know His Heart Is True
If I Could Talk I Would Say To You
CAN I LIVE
CAN I LIVE
I Will Always Be apart of you
Trust Your Soul Know His Heart Is True
If I Could Talk I Would Say To You
CAN I LIVE
CAN I LIVE
[Repeat 2]

[Talking]

Its uplifting foreal yall
i aint passing no judgement
aint making no decisions
I am just telling ya'll my story
my love life
i love my mother for giving me life
we all need to appreciate life
a strong women that had to make a sacrifice
Thanks for listening
Thanks for listening
Mama thanks for listening"

"event","and all the sudden she stops.
standing still, observing life at a distance;
everything seems so surreal,
but its reality, and thats the hardest thing for her to comprehend.
the immaculate tone of her skin
in the depths of winters cold scream,
the radiance perpetuated in her dark brown eyes
alluring those around her.

she observes the world.
hands from the dead emerge,
grasping her and singing agonizing rhythms
in attempt to consume and annihilate everything she is.
fear is the only way to fall to the depths of darkness,
for fear is her only sin.

living a life.
a life lived.
a prayer is whispered for the sanity of the world,
for the woman.
the woman takes off her clothes,
opens her arms to the earth in its entirety,
and screams out of saddness and the fear of not knowing
when she will die and how she can live another day...
""daylight please save my soul.""

and all the sudden she stops,
turns around and obeserves the world around her.
so surreal, but its reality.
so hard for her to comprehend."

I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I WANT TO GO. im so sick of it. i just want to quit everything.

bball is starting soon, i love it.  i dont have as much love for it as i used to, but i really do love it.  its a way for me to take my stress and frustration out and to forget about shit.  

my ex that i still talk to is in jail again.  i miss him.  i really do.  i just wish i had a boyfriend so bad.  i really miss someone else a lot, and i know he misses me to.  but at the same time, i cant stand him, but it doesnt make any since i want to be with him. so bad.  my dad told me that he wished i was happy and said that i need to stop looking for a relationship so much because i compromise my values and get with people just because i feel like i need to.  i wish my life would make since.

starting next wk im only working weekends... cuz of bball.  it should be nice.  

im blabing about nothing pretty much.  today in ceramics i made two cylinders.  by friday i have to make five, one with a handle.  i took home my strawberry today.  i must say it kicks serious ass.

thats all for now, i have to go get ready for work.  

peace.


its you and me and all of the people,
with nothing to do, nothing to prove.
and i dont know why, i cant take my eyes off of you."

"event","i walk into the school cafeteria
and am bombarded by all the little immature freshmen 
and other people who just can't grow up and act their age.
my eyes scan the overcrowded space,
and i observe all the different ""cliques,""
conversating, laughing, and such.
i find my group of ""friends""
and present myself as i always do.
i squish myself into a seat 
and pretend to smile and laugh at all of those little petty jokes
that aren't even funny.
im good at lying through my teeth,
telling others how great my life is,
how i have so many things going for me.
i love walking through the hallways with my nose pointed up 
and i make sure to paint that same pearly white smile on my face.
i love it when i see a certain person in the hall.
i walk past them, laugh with one of my friends, and act like they were never there.
i dont want them to know that i am alone.
i dont want them to know that i am hurt and wishing i had them back in my life.
they need to think that i am happy and better off without them,
just so they can feel shame and regret for letting me go before; for hurting me.
i am so good at pretending to be happy.
every day of these past four years have been a game,
i always win; i never show anyone my shame.
yeah ill admit its one of my biggest faults-
me acting like someone im not.
but i guess thats just the way it goes,
you gota lie and pretend for others, the rest God knows."

"event","last night i made a man out of pillows
and dressed him using the random pieces of clothing you left behind.
i made sure everything looked just perfect and fit just right,
because you always cared about your apperance.

my dog ran into my room and started barking at my pillow man.
her bark was always your biggest complaint.
she tackled my pillow man
the way you did when we play-fought eachother.
she gave the pillow a small lick after i yelled at her to stop
just like the way you always gave me a kiss to show you were playing too.

i took out my bottles of nailpolish
and observed each one of them just like you did.
i chose that same color you chose.
the pink one with the sparkles.
i remembered the big blob you put on my nail when you attempted to paint them.
i smiled just the same smile you did.
then i remembered how you quickly straghtened your face,
because even though you had no idea what you were doing,
you would have never admitted it.

i put on my long pink dress, let my hair down, 
but didnt put any make up on.
that was your favorite dress of mine.
you loved my hair down.
you always said i looked more beautiful before i put any makeup on.
it seemed a little out of content, 
like a little girl playing dress up.
but it made me happy,
the same kind of happy you made me feel when you held me close and dear.

i know there are supposed to be romantic evenings 
at the fanciest restaurants
and the perfect radio love songs. 
all of those happy, sweet love movies where the endings are perfect and everyone falls in love.
where is my perfect ending?
i guess God doesn't amend the details."

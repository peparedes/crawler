Leave and just chill with my friends.  Shit, I would take a drug test every week if I just go out like I used to.  I really would, not doing drugs doesn't bother me.  It's being stuck at home that does, and that's usaully the reason I did them anyways, cause I have to go home at night where it sucks and didn't want to think about it.
So yeah, now I'm all clean, and basically waiting, just waiting.  That's all.

Annie's 12 years old, in two more she'll be a whore
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way
Don't be afraid with the quickness you'll get laid
For your family get paid
It's the wrong way
I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
(Big) salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her make-up 
I never wanted 
A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits
It's the wrong way 
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can
It's the wrong way
The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine until the day she met me
Happy are you sad, wanna shoot your dad
I'll do anything I can
It's the wrong way
We talk all night, try to make it right
Believe me shit was tight
It was the wrong way
So run away if you wanna stay
Cause I ain't here to make ya, oh no 
It's up to you what you really wanna do
Spend some time in America
Dub style!
She'll give you all that she got to give
But I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big salty tears rollin' down to her chin
And it smears up her make-up
I never wanted
So we ran away 
And I'm sorry when I say, that straight to this very day
It was the wrong way
She took a hike it don't matter if I like it or not 
Because she only wants the wrong way
I gave her all that I had to give
But she still wouldn't take it, oh no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve
But it still ruins her make-up
I never wanted"

3:05AM - and i still feel his arms around me.
this morning sucked. my dad was being an ass as usual. the afternoon picked up though. 
chris picked me up, we chilled for a while then we went and took drew home. 
we drove into dc, some lady told us we had a flat tire. we pulled over and shit it had no air in it. we found a gas station, drove the car over there and filled the air up. *pause* the air leaked out quickly. we tried patching it with bandaids, made annoying loud screechy sound. soo we were like fuck it, and drove to the 9:30 club. we found a place to park and left the car. we went to the line, not a lot of people! later on tons of people were behind us. it was pretty cold. we got inside we were walking in and shit, there was mikey. and mini-me. mini-me gave me a hug. we wandered around for a while. went down, found mini-me. the openers were amusing. not very good. no one was too enthusiastic about them. lol. dingleberry dynasty and dog fashion disco. once MSI came out, it was great. steve righ? was up on the amp and i sat there and stared at him and turned my head side to side. lol. i got kicked in the head lots by crowd surfers. shit everyone fucking got dropped. lol. chris crowd surfed. i screamed along really loud to faggot just for aleks. i didnt get smashed! chris had his arms around me most of the time. i told him lotsa big people, likkle ashley might die. lol. but i did not. it was fucking awesome. i'm in love with the one guy from DFD. lol. more in love with Jimmy Urine!!!! they got too insane, Lyn-Z did a dive off the amp, jimmy was throwing a stool around on stage. 9:30 club security decided they were being too rowdy and made them stop playing. urine and lyn-z were giving autographs so chris got one of our tickets signed by jimmy. i tried to get to lyn-z but i kept getting smashed. chris gave me the ticket. i was soooooo happy. sooo we left after that. went to get shit out of the car. then we walked to the metro. we met a homeless man named pierre. he told us why he hates 9:30 club and his minute-long life story. then he walked us to the crosswalk (some other people were with us too). he was a general and demanded we be polite. and say our thankyous to him. we all gave him moneys. for christmas. he made this lady cry. with his story. umm so we got on the metro and went to springfield. chris had his big jacket so he wrapped me up with him in it. we called my dad and he came to get us. i really love that boy. he makes me feel so special and he's so so sweet. he kept apologizing for his car, but i told him i'm not one of those people that freaks over stupid things. i was just like okay, so we're stranded, let's figure out what to do. i'm calm. shit, we were stranded in SE DC. lol. when we checked the flat, we pulled into a subway parking lot and he was like, well it's not the safest but-- *some guy running with a bag very very quickly down the alley*. lol. yeah. it was really cold and kinda windy. but it could've been worse, i told him. so we finally got back. i am a very happy girl. justine is not tonight. she's the only girl so far that i have not been the least bit annoyed with (other than brittany, she tells me bout chinchillas). true, she did grow on me. but i hate seeing her repetetively get hurt like this. if i werent shaking and shivering so bad from the god damn cold (yeah i know, STILL!, chris pointed out i'm sensitive to temperatures cos i'm little i dont have much to keep me warm.), i would stay awake longer. i'm having trouble typing. dammmit.

"event","alright, so Tim came by first without Chris Smith, and um...confessed that he thought i was amazing, and he has never had anyone understand and be able to talk to him like i can.  Then, he asked me to kiss him, but i refused cause his best friend Chris really really likes me, and i could just see the drama unfolding.  So, he left to go get Chris and didn't tell chris that he came first, and they came back and we talked for a while.  The Tim went to go warm up the car, and Chris grabbed me and kissed me, and I just couldn't say no, cause like I liked him last year but I just never did anything about it and forgot about it cause i had a bf at the time.  So, now 2 best friends like me, and I kissed one of them and they are coming over tomorrow.  The drama is in big neon lights above my head, and I don't know what to do.  The irony, Tim is engaged but said I was so much more in tune with him then his fiance.  Tim's 24, and Chris is 18, so I guess Tim is a lil old anyways.  But I don't know what to do or say, cause the truth is that tim and i do connect intellectual level."

Originally, I was supposed to get off at 9pm but Katie quit and stormed out int he middle of the day and left Alex and I to work late because of her.  After work, Alex took me to the store to get a pack of cigarettes and sropped me off at home.  I talked to Diana, she's so great.  I still feel like shit though, most of the time I don't even know why.  Maybe there's a chance and I just don't see it.  I would be so happy if there was just a small chance, even though I know I'll never measure up.  I need to redye my hair tomorrow, it's such a pain in the ass.

I hate Turkey day.  I am dreading it.  My family sucks, and the only one I really like won't be there.  (My Daddy)  But hopefully, I'll get to see him this weekend.  He's awesome, and always brings me at least one pack of cigarettes to get me through.  The rest of my family totally blows though, and I am hoping to leave and go out tomorrow night.

My managers thought I looked sad today at work and gave me candy.  Hehe.  They also promised more days off next week which is good.  I think I'm going to quit right before Spring break so that I can have spring break off with my new car that I plan on having by then.  And with a car, I can get such a better job.  Pizza Hut just works for now cause it's walking distance.

I hate the cold weather.  It pisses me off.  I feel sick and icky all the time.  I wish Spring would hurry up and come around.  That and June will be the last time I have to go to highschool during the day.  Yay!

Well, I hope everyone else has a good Turkey day!  Buh Byez for now."

And thrown away for what?  Some empty dream that will never come true.  Some little part of me that trusted a man's word  (not you Mikey, you know I still love you).  I feel I can't believe anything anymore from almost anyone.  My friend Sarah ( I love her so much), hugged me and kissed all day cause I was crying, and even though it cheered me up somewhat, it wasn't the same.  I don't know if anyone can relate, but I just wish I had someone to look forward to in the morning.  Some exciting person to sweep me off my feet, even if only for a brief moment.  I think I need drugs right now.  Drugs make me happy, they love me, they treat me right, they give something to look forward to, and they even take my money.  Just like a man, they always go away too.  

Heh, I realize that I bitch a lot.  But if good things would happen more...wish wish wish...I'd definately post that over this shit.

Oh yeah, and a license might help too.  Work was a drag, I got in a fight with ""White Mike"".  He royally pisses me off.  He used to live with my ex, so i saw him like everyday.  He would always steal the room for us just to talk to Drea on the phone.  He's really stingy with the smoke even though we always hooked him up.  I also gave him a warm place to stay at my house and food all the time, and even cigarette money.  In return for all of that, he's a total ass.  He sat down with me one day about a year ago and broke down with me and just told me his whole life story and half of the time a was this really great friend, and the other half I wasn't.  I hate people who do that.

Enough of my bitching though...I wanna know a good way of getting something off my mind.  I haven't found one yet, and I hate thinking about this certain something all day long.  Hope someone has suggestions.
Love to you all!"

"event","You...

You took my heart,
tore it away,
and ripped it apart.
But nothing did I say.

You left me mangled,
black and blue, 
with my hair all tangled,
because I loved you.

You won my thought,
then proceeded to betray.
All this shit I bought,
but nothing do I say.

My inside is aching.
I hope yours is too.
My heart is breaking,
because I loved you.




Fuck it, I give up..."

"event","I don't really know what's up with him.  I tried to make it easy on him with the whole ""break"" thing, but come to find out he was calling from across the street and bbiked to my house like 5 secs after I told him.  (at least he brought me a pack of cigs)  He was in my front lawn, he cried and yelled a lot.  He thinks it some kind of conspiracy and that I'm taking sides or something, even though I'm kinda sitting on the sidelines watching.  So, until he contacts me next, I have no idea what's going on.  As far as I am concerned right now, we're on a break or whatever.  At least, my definition of a break.  He said a break was when he gets his stuff and I never wanna see his face again, I don't know what the hell that is about.  It sounds like a hateful break-up to me, and I don't have those.  No reason to hold a grudge.  Ok, 'till next time, buh bye.  :)



oh yeah, i hope you didn't leave a message on my cell Diana, cause ummm..., I've had it for over a yr and still don't have a password for messages...so..I'll never get it.  lol"

"event","Mikey called me.  I told him what I had heard, he started crying and was at my house in like a whole of 5 seconds.  He continued crying and screaming and denying everything that was ever said.  I don't know what to do.  It's too much for me...."

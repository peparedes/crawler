Im goign through so much pain that I dont even know what to do. I feel a lot like Tyna did. It sucks! Nothing I do or say can bring back the person I miss the most. My pain is slowly making room for anger as I push the people who I am really close to away and I dont want that to happen. I migh be going away for a while because I am sick. it is hard to explain but if I go away then I want Jess and Tyna to know that I love you two girls more then anythign and will miss you.</p>"

I act like I hate her but I love her. Her friends from school kno so they are probably going to talk to me about it but Im not ready to face the music. I just want to lock my self in a rom and die. and no im NOT suicidle so dont get the wrong impression! I lost a piece of my heart that may never come back unil I see my sister again. Until then I will be sad and confused waiting to hear from her. The worst part is Im not allowed to go any where just in case I get an email. I feel like Im to blame b/c i feel like i helped her run"

He says he likes me but then he likes another girl who is in the eighth grade! I find that just gross! I mean how can you care for a guy so much who likes you but also likes an 8th grader? I just dont get it! I mean he can have a sophmore who would be so happy with him and who cares about him as much or almost as much as the guy said to them online which i wont repeat but Tyna knows what word Im talkin about! It sux when he is undecided as to who he likes more. But he shouldn ttell me he likes me, call me babe, then&nbsp;tell me the word he used and then like another girl. I mean it is mean and just plain confusing!&nbsp;On top of that I discovered that Dillon(college Dillon) was right about a few things which didnt help me at all! The worst part about it was that Dillon was right about almost everything!!! I am mad at him but I cant really be mad at him for being right either!

I like this one guy ""jock"" (not his real name just a nick name) but any ways he tells me he likes me all the time when we text. then he tells me that I am beautiful and that my eyes are gorgeous. But everytime he is with his friend he gets all quiet and stuff. Like today I waved to him after school and he waved for me to go over. SO I go over there and give him a hug and wait for him to talk to me since he called me over..yet nothing came out of his mouth until I asked him if he was okay. I mean thats really wierd...yeah your friend that I had a past with was there but he shouldnt have called me over there to be quiet. Aww it drives me crazy.

Then Dillon had to open his big mouth and ask me what was wrong and if I was ready to tell him&nbsp;which made the painful memory come back. Some things are meant to be kept because it is embarassing and something that I am ashamed of. I could have tried to forget about it but he has to keep askin me. I would rather fake evrything being okay then walk around in tears. Now all I want is cookie dough ice cream to calm me down. Wheres a friend when you need a shoulder to cry on?

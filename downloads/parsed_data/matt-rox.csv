"event","what a nice day it was outside.. today rocked!  i went to a shooting range with my mom and her man. it was really fun .i was shooting my moms gun it was a sig sp 2009 9mm with a 10 shot clip.it took some practice but i got thet hang of it and after no time i was destroying the bullseye yes.... i kept the target to show everyone, i'm gonna hang it in my room  cause i'm gangsta like that. and i fixed my phone today woohoo! i'm gonna try to work all day tomorow so the day goes faster because i can't wait to get back home and see everyone .

i'm a bad conversationalist when it comes to talking on the phone, me and GHL talk everyday but i don't ever really say much, thats ok. i just hope she doesn't think i'm always like this, hopefuly i can let my guard down with her and be my regular goofy self and talk more.. i got self esteem issues.. 

on saturdat i'm going to drive from New Hampshire to Virginia,  thats 7 states i'm driving through its gonna be a crazy adventure but my moms got a ipod and i just got a cd player so atleast i'll have some tunes to listen to   and the car has A.C   so i won't need the jaws of life to get me outta my seat when i get back.. i'm hungry i want some pizza damnit. my mom doesn't like pizza??!! if i don't eat pizza atleast once a month i'll go into a coma. luckily i'm not staying up here for a month.. 
its all good tho   i'm havn fun up here is all that matters."

"event","well well well here we are again. i havn't done alot today or i guess i shoud say yesturday. very uneventful i guess i could put it .its been raining outside. i've been watching the news its really saddening to see so many people suffering from this hurricane many have died and many more are dieing because of the present condition(no electricty,no water,no food,ect..)and the low income communities got hit the worst. alot of them stayed in there houses(shanties j/k)even after being evacuated because ""were elseare we supposed to go"".well the answer to that is anywhere thats not being evacuated.but now they are forced to leave or die. i see a great strength in those fortunate to suvive the disaster they have a lot of hardships ahead of them .but i also see a great weakness in them.many have taken to the riots(food and water ok.but guns?not ok) but even worse there are some arrogant assholes robbing people at gunpoint  instead of working together as a community there just adding to the misery.. wtf?        and aren't those reporters annoying?   

well enough of that. good humor lady has been keeping me in good spirits we've been talking on the phone alot  and even thought i've been getting thease waves of depression today (for no reason) as soon as we talked on the phone i felt much better, she rocks.  but i'm gettin sleeepy . thanx for writing in my journal gary & carrie it makes me feel special.   

goodnight."

"event","hello , i'm in new hamshire i havn't written in my journal in a couple of days but i'll fill in the gaps... good humor lady  is awsome. she spent the night with me on saturday  and sunday  she kept me warm and happy. i would be lying if i said i didn't miss her.talking to her on the phone at night is my weekly entertainment. she even invited me to come spend the night at her house when i get back. it was shitty on monday tho. my cellphone broke and i didn't knw her number. i was stressed. but somehow i managed to get her phone number and call her and apologize  for not caling when i said i would. everything is all good now.   monday was ruff as soon as i got to NH i had to work(moving rocks,digging holes,pouring concrete.).it sucked cause i didn't get any sleep the night before(hehe).  but my mom bought me 100$ boots to work in(that was cool)they also paid me double (20 dollars an hour folks) and afterward they took me out for a lobster dinner(lobster! yes!). so overall i had a really good time acept for my cell phone breaking.
oh yeah and my mom took me to target and bought me some clothes(mad props momma dukes). 
today i slept in..kinda.. my mom woke me up at 10 and had me do some work around the house it was no sweat tho and i did it with a smile on my face cause i know that im getting hooked up. then around 3 we went sailboat racing (filled with high speed chases and gunfights  some guy got stabed in the heart with a trident it was crazy). then afterwards  there was a little shindig at the yacht club. i had 2 hot dogs a hamburger and 4 coorslight cans.
now i'm back at the crib( bud light in hand)  writing about al my little victorys and adventures . overall i've been having a great experiance. i feel like i don't deserve this, i havn't been this happy in a long time, first meeting GHL, then coming up to new hamshire. i truely am a lucky person
.     bye."

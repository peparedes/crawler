"event","It's friggin' cold. Like REALLY cold. So I went to my car, all ready to actually go pay my rent and then go to my stupid job... when all of a sudden... My car refused to shift out of park. WTF? So I sit there for a few minutes hoping I'm just stupid and forgot about something.. nope! It's FROZEN!!!!! My car had a slight flooding issue recently... like lots of water... and now with this LOVELY 14 degree weather... it froze. It's days like this I miss my Ford. Manuals are soooooo much easier to deal with in odd situations. Automatics... well, there's not much you can do. I can't wait to get another manual... *crosses fingers* sometime soon hopefully.

(I love my car. I love my car. I love my car. I love my car.) OK, off to try to start it once more!"

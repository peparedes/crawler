"event","So yesterday I sat around all fuckin' day listening to Hirax and hanging out w/Sheanna.  I fell asleep at like 3:30 a.m. and woke up @ 7:30 a.m.  Yet I feel completely rested.  This, of course, means my ass will be dragging by noon.

It's great how I'm so boring that the best thing I have to talk about is my sleeping patterns.  Yippie.

I'm getting really psyched for my upcoming trip to Arizona.  From March 22-24 there's a big festival thing going on there, and me, Sheanna, and my friend <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~seekresistance/"">Jayke</a> are going down to it, and staying with Jayke's friend, Taryn.  It's gonna be really rad.  There's gonna be all sorts of infoshops and tables, not to mention a bunch of amazing bands (i.e. Sea Of Deprivation, Contravene, and RESIST & EXIST!!!).  I can already tell I'm gonna have a total ball, and I hope to be mindlessly shitfaced from the day we arrive until the day we leave.

We're taking a bus, so it's gonna take like 2 days plus some hours to get there.  I can handle it, though.  I'll just smoke a fuckload before getting on the bus, and bring some NyQuil with me in case my bitch ass needs to sleep out of boredom.

And if I get really bored, me and Jayke can always escape to the tiny bathroom to make sweet, passionate love.   We do that sort of thing.

Ahh..yeah.  Again, if you get the chance, go to my band's website.  The url is <a href=""http://aescariot.cjb.net"">http://aescariot.cjb.net</a>

We'll be fuckin' rocking in due time, believe you me.

Ok, well, I really need a cigarette so it's time for me to take my leave.  As of late I've been updating moreoften, however, so expect the same for a while (until I slack off again).  I leave you with something I wrote last night.  Enjoy.

<b><u>Let This Be The Spirit That Haunts You</b></u><br>
The young girl stands dourly on the side of the dirt road.  Flies drone about her head, seeming as pox upon her entire being.  She blinks twice and some of the insects fly off of her, but eventually return.  In her hands she holds nothing, nothing had ever been given to her.  Another bomb drops off to the west, and she jerks her head in the direction.  There used to be orchards here.  There used to be animals here.  There used to be families here.  She closes her eyes and wishes she could remember happiness.  It hadn't existed for her up to this point.  A tear escapes her eye, adding to a small puddle beneath her.  She stares doubtfully at her bare feet.  Give up all hope, there's no such thing as freedom here.  Another tear, adding to the puddle.  Give up all courage, the worst is yet to come.  She begins to walk back to the village where she was born.  This village was once a city.  This village was once the pride of the world.  Greed overcame, revulsion overcame.  All of our wars had resulted in nothing.  Fuck peace.  We need revenge.  Our hands and our minds are blemished blood red today.  And so, she takes the familiar steps home to ramshackle hut she lives in.  The familiar shade cast onto the land some days by the Statue of Liberty standing as a living, breathing symbol of this crumbled planet's voracity.  Goodnight, sweet child, goodnight.

"event","So this morning I woke up to the familiar sound of my mother barking something or other at me from upstairs.  She tells me it's this place I recently applied to on the phone.  So, figuring it was a possible job, I pick up the phone.  The conversation went something like this.

Me: Hello?

Mindless Army Asshole: Hi, this is (whomever) from the U.S. Army.  I'm calling you today to see if you'd be interested in joining the U.S. Army.

Me: Not especially, no.

MAM: Oh, well..did you watch the Super Bowl?

Me: No.

MAM: It was real tough stuff, the Pat's won.

Me: Oh yeah?  Football ain't my bag.

MAM: Well, what I see that you graduated from high school last year.  What have you been doing since then?

Me: Absolutely nothing!

MAM: Well, how would you like to earn some money?

Me: I don't want any money.

MAM: YOU DON'T WANT ANY MONEY???  Well, what about college?  Would you like to go to college?

Me: Nah, not really.

MAM: Well, what do you want for your future?

Me: How about peace, autonomy, and not killing the innocent?

MAM: Well, out of the 212 jobs that we offer in the US Army, only 30 of them deal with actual combat.

Me: Haha..ok, sure.

MAM: So you don't want money and you don't want to go to college.  What about defending your country?

Me: I could really care less, I'm not interested.

MAM: Why?

Me: I'm a pacifist.

MAM: A pacifist?  ::laughs:: That's interesting.

Me: Yeah, it sure is!

MAM: What about your friends?  Would any of them be interested in the U.S. Army?

Me: No.

MAM: None of them?

Me: No.  They all feel basically the same as I do.

MAM: Well, then..you keep this in mind.  Your country will be waiting for you.  I'll get in touch soon.

Me: Yes sir!

And then I hung up.

It's funny how he tried to be buddy-buddy with me by talking about the Patriots winning the Super Bowl..like I could give a fuck.

Anyway..that's it for now.

I'm SO in the army now.

I can't wait to be the first boy in my neighborhood to come home in a pine box."

"event","So I guess me and Nick are starting a new band.  This time around it's gonna be him, me, my friend <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~seekresistance"">Jayke</a>, an Nick's friend Matt.  We're calling ourselves Aescariot..bow before THIS:<p><center>
<img src=""http://diypages.diy-auction.com//aescariot/AESCARIOT3.GIF""></center><p>

Also..go to oursite: http://aescariot.cjb.net<p>

I feel really optimistic about this, uh..project.  I haven't felt the slightest bit of optimism when thinking of a band I was part of in a long while.  Hopefully all of my optimism pays off.  If not, I'll continue to try.

So me and Sheanna are still together.  Almost 6 months at this point.  I don't hate her at all.  She doesn't bug me or make me want to leave for good.  I'm silly in love with her and not at all ashamed to admit it.  When ya got a good thing, why bother pretending you don't?

Well..that's all for now.  I'm gonna try to update this more frequently.  It's become one tiny piece of my life that I've let go...yeah.

Me, my girlfriend Sheanna, and my friends <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~seekresistance"">Jayke</a> and Rob are going to Flagstaff, AZ to go to the Organize & Arise Festival.  Fuckin' alright.  We leave the 17th in Providence and have to take a bus for almost 3 days to get there...and to get back.  Haha..who cares?  It'll be brutal, and I think half of the fun of travelling is the fun you have on the way there.

Maybe I'm just lame.

That's definitely it.

So, since no one but me and Jayke are motivated on the <a href=""http://aescariot.cjb.net"">Aescariot</a> thing anymore, I guess for now me and him are just gonna do it together.  Oh well.  I suppose we can pull it off.

Me and Sheanna have been getting along really well as of late.  We'd been fighting a lot, but I guess we've stopped it for now.  I fucking hate fighting..it's so pointless.

So I guess that's all for now..time to listen to some more Rudi Peni, and then go outside and smoke..I'm so cool."

Muthafuckin' Organize & Arise Fest, my friends.  I'm gonna literally piss in my pants when I get to see Sea Of Deprivation.  They're fucking mindblowing.  I seriously suggest if you're into sorta gloomy crust a la Dystopia, Misery, blah blah blah, you go to <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/az/catchphraze"">Catchphraze Records'</a> site and pick their LP up..it's only like $8 ppd., so don't be lame.

Yesterday I got a tape in the mail..it has Fuck On The Beach's demo, the Bread & Water/Reason Of Insanity split 7"", Econochrist's demo, and some Dying Fetus tracks on it.  <b>HAHDCAW!!!</b>

Me and Sheanna really need to motivate and get her car back on the road (legally...haha).  For the past week or so, my friend <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~seekresistance"">Jayke</a> has been wanting us to go pick him up to spend the weekend here, as we've done a few times before.  Me and Sheanna would absolutely <b>love</b> to, but driving an unregistered, uninsured car around is pretty fuckin' silly..not to mention the breaks are five minutes from totally shot.

Oh well.  The other day I took Sheanna shopping for lingerie -- her idea, not mine.  Anyway..she really seemed to enjoy the shit I bought for her, so that makes me happy.  Today we ordered new Chucks.....Monochrome Black Hi-Tops, here I come..haha.

I've been buying a lot of music lately, which is rad.  This having money concept isn't so bad..it isn't actually having the money I like..it's the things I can buy for myself and others that are rad.  Haha.  Anyway..I picked up the following music this week:

Tragedy - s/t LP
Fleas & Lices - ""Recipes For Catastrophies"" LP
Crass - ""Stations Of The CR(A)SS"" CD

So it ain't that much, but it is for me.  I'm also sending away for some tapes from Catchphraze...Kontraattaque, Seth!, The Smartpils..good shite.

So I started night school last Thursday (for the second year).  I only hafta take one class a week: English 102.  Eh..it's so boring.  Fuck it, it don't matter.  After this bullshit class, I'll be a certified high school graduate....at the age of 19 (by the time I graduate).

<b>Starbelly</b>
Dear Everything, today I witnessed a crucifixion in pink and lavender and gold.  I've heard people say that beauty is in the details, but I don't think they have ever seen you.  There were mortal wounds inflicted on the sky and incriminating blue stains on my shirt.  The shirt you bought for me.  Christ it hurts like stars in my belly going supernova.  I feel like a zombie that refuses to live.  Haunting the junkyards and cutting myself on scraps of you.  The other day I masturbated to pictures of you at your birthday party.  They were the only ones I still had.  It felt so wrong, just like my life.  I hope I'm dead by the time you read this.  I love you.

I have things to say that mean a lot to me..and basically no way to express them.  I'm not saying in an artistic way - fuck art.  I'm saying in a political way.  Music's a powerful force...I feel like I can offer something to the world if I say the right things.  Well, right to me anyway.

I need a job real bad, but every place I think of, it seems like working there would be worse than death.  I'm so amazingly unmotivated to do anything but sleep and get high.  Which isn't really that cool considering I'm 18 and should have SOME sense of responsibility.

"event","Last night I got ridiculously black out drunk up at my friend Matt's house.

I have no recollection of anything I do.  This can't be good..haha.

Eh...tomorrow I'm going to see Diskonto in Jamaica Plain with Dave.  It should be a whole lot of fun if nothing bad goes down.  Chances are it will.

Well, I've run out of shit to say, so I'm done.  Bye, softcore fuckers."

"event","So yeah..this is my second entry.  It's a miracle I've done it even twice..heh.  So yeah, today didn't suck at all.  I woke up around noon...my friend Colleen came over around 5:30.  We ended up in Harvard Square hanging out.

It gave me the chance to get out and hang out with people I can relate to, which is nice.  I relate to my friends around here, but going out and hanging with different people is fun.

And some of my friends don't seem to be into leaving the area, which can get boring.

So, since it's like 2 in the morning, it's officially the 4th of July.  Great.  A stupid holiday based off of patriotism.  This country doesn't mean shit to me.  Whatever..it's an excuse to get tanked and walk around like a douche bag all day.

Ah..I don't got anything else to say, so I guess I'm done for now.  Booya."

"event","So this is my first entry.  I have an older online journal deal at <a href=""http://stillborn.diaryland.com"">http://stillborn.diaryland.com</a>, but I'm sick to death of Diaryland.  Yeah.  Way to bitch about shit that doesn't matter.

Well..yesterday my friends' band played a show.  They're called <a href=""http://www.awkward-silence.com"">Awkward Silence</a>.  It was fun, I guess.  I mean, shows tend to be, I suppose.  They're not really the type of music I'm into, but I'll deal.

At the end of the show me and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/phm"">Mike</a> were dicking around and being asses and I ended up with a split eyebrow.  Now I'm telling people that it'll make girls think I'm mysterious and sexy.  Unlikely.

I'm done now, softcore fans."

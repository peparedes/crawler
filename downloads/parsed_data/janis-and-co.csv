"event","So many months since I posted last. Oh dear. Well let's see, I am officialy divorced, and I am proud of us, because we have remained friends. <br />Ed and I are still together and getting hitched in September ( Mark yer Calenders!). To Quote Jane Eyre:&quot;<strong>I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect concord is the result.&quot;</strong> <br />Well, almost perfect, anyhow ;) <br />Finances are still tight,&nbsp; we are moving this summer,&nbsp; found a fab apartment, and I have GOT to start looking for work el Pronto! Other than that not much to report, I will try to post more often, I know my track record is lousy, so no promises! I will at least try to keep better track of everybody else in eljay land, I haven't forgotten you!"

"event","<br />As per usual, when I neglect my ElJAy everything in my&nbsp; life descends into complete chaos, and this hiatus has been no exception.&nbsp; Clark's surgery was not a complete success, (at least not the way&nbsp; he wanted it to be) and there were some complications.&nbsp; I took care of&nbsp; him post op as well as I could,&nbsp; just like I have the&nbsp; past&nbsp; 9 years of my life, but as usual. It wasn't&nbsp; enough.&nbsp; 2 weeks ago, we made the decision to separate.. To be honest, there are things I'm amazed I've put up with for 9 years. You see, no matter what, I've always been as honest as I can with him. And I do have feelings for someone else (Mind you, up to that point I had not acted on those feelings) HIs response was that maybe we should separate.. To be honest, I was really surprised that he said this. I had been feeling distance between us, but assumed it was all on my end. After a couple more days of consideration, he told me that he didn't love me anymore, . The next day he'd changed his mind, but... Too late. (Turns our because of a medicine imbalance that he actually might have not been in his right mind when he said this... The unfortunate fact is he was still correct. He and I are holding each other back.) It was like someone has bopped me over the head and woken me up. He and I are just not good for each other, and that was the deciding factor. It wasn't just that I wanted out, and wanted to be with someone I AM way more compatible with (Although that is the case) I wanted to free him of me too. I don''t like the person I am when I'm with him She is spiteful, hateful and unhappy. I'm tired of living with her, and I'm sure Clark is, too.&nbsp; As for my new guy, well, it's serious. We love each other, and&nbsp; as is my MO, it happened really fast. Except for financial and logistical worries, I'm happier right now&nbsp; that I have ever been&nbsp;&nbsp; My New guy (His name is Ed BTW) and I have been friends for&nbsp; a long time, but this being in love with each other thing is new. Except for hurting Clark , I have no regrets about my decision. I think I&nbsp; would have&nbsp; hurt him more in the&nbsp; long run, I honestly do.&nbsp; I feel I gave my marriage my best shot, and it is well past time for me to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Livejournal was established&nbsp; during my first divorce, when I was trying to&nbsp; get my feelings straight, and&nbsp; trying to figure&nbsp; out what I&nbsp; wanted.&nbsp; On the surface, it looks like history repeating itself, but I have grown older and a little wiser since then . (I hope)&nbsp; Advice Comments and general Mojo would be appreciated, thanks. And I will try to update as best I can. <div id=""postmenu_11553161_menu"" class=""vbmenu_popup"" style=""display: none"">&nbsp;</div>"

Despite being inspired my brother, I didn't make this list till Dave made me do it, nevertheless, I think I may learn a few things about myself as I share them with others.</p><p>2. Faithwise, I'm pretty muddled. My belief in God and Jesus Christ is crystal clear, the rest, well, I'm working on it.</p><p>3. .I hate funerals, and plan to have a party when i die.</p><p>4. I really love Children, and want my own.</p><p>5. I have been married twice, to the same man. It's working out a lot better the second time:) From him, I have learned that romance comes and goes, but love goes on and on.</p><p>6. I've been afraid to drive for years. My goal for 2009 is to end it being the proud owner of my driver's license, so stay off the sidewalks.</p><p>7. I've been a fan of Simon and Garfunkel since I can remember. Their music has had a profound impact on my life. and I try to share it with as many people as I can. I love music of all kinda, but they're still my favorite.</p><p>8. I'm not much of a drinker, but my favorite drink is Southern Comfort and Coke with a splash of lime.</p><p>9. I have the strangest dreams of almost anybody I know, but the really odd thing is that I recall them most of the time when I wake up. Also, I dream in color.</p><p>10. I know a lot of really really horrible jokes, and greatly enjoy inflicting them on other people. Mwahahahahaha.</p><p>11. I am a sentimental person. I cry easily, and I wear my heart on my sleeve. Some people see this as a weakness, but I don't. It's just the way I'm wired, and I can't really change it, I see it as a weakness, but also as a strength. I can't hide my feelings, but at least people know I am being honest.</p><p>12. I tell myself &quot;bedtime stories&quot; before I go to sleep. My two favorite ones are a (non sexual!) fantasy about Art Garfunkel, and one of me as a genius kid. I don't know why these two always put me to sleep, but they do, Perhaps it explains number 9.</p><p>13. I love cats. Mine sleeps with me every night, even though he is rotten.</p><p>14.I've got a stubborn streak a mile wide, but I think I can be reasoned with (at least most of the time)</p><p>15. I miss my Grandparents, all of them, a lot. (I am Grateful that some of my Great Aunts are still alive, and I think my Aunt Gerry could probably kick my ass in a fair fight.</p><p>16. I love Philly steak sandwiches. I think they are the world's most perfect food, and someday I'm going to Pennsylvania to eat a &quot;real&quot; one.</p><p>17. Is my Birthday, March 17, 1979. I Love my Birthday, in all of it's beery Green Irish glory.</p><p>18. Is my Brother's Birthday, the following Day and year from mine, my brother knows me better than anyone else in the world, probably. except for my husband, and like my husband uses this information to push my buttons, but also to sometimes know the exact right thing to say. Love ya, Jen.</p><p>19. The older I get, the faster time goes, in another ten years, I believe I will be approaching light speed.</p><p>20. I think that I am an ok singer, a pretty good cook, a fair masseuse and I try to be a good listener. I can also read really fast, have at least half a brain, and can type 30 WPM.</p><p>21. I have a bad temper, tend to be lazy, can't sew worth a damn, and can't draw a straight line with a ruler, also I'm hopelessly uncoordinated.</p><p>22. One thing I am most grateful for in my life is my parents. I have a stellar Mom and Dad. Everytime I think about them, it puts a smile on my face, and I realize that there are many who don't have this blessing</p><p>23 Politically, I'm pretty middle of the road. Much to my Daddy's chagrin, I do lean a bit left. I am registered as an independant.</p><p>24. If I could throw a dinner party and invite 9 people, living or dead, I would invite:<font face=""Times New Roman"" size=""3"">Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel, My Grandma Treva,Amelia Earhart,Mick FoleyJanis Joplin,Gilda Radner,the Apostle Paul and Miss Piggy .</font><br />&nbsp;</p><p>25. As I finish this list, I'm a bit chilly, a lot tired, smoking a cigarette, and listening to Harry Chapin. Hope you enjoyed reading this.</p></font>"

"event","I think I better get my smokes for this one, because it&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;be a looooong post. After all the&nbsp; shit that went&nbsp; down in October and November, it's been an ok month.&nbsp; I've written a couple of times about the side effects of Clark's epilepsy , trying not to go into too much detail in order to protect his privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're now looking into brain surgery as an option. I was dead set against it first, I mean, how scary is that, if something goes wrong, , well, I don't like thinking about it.&nbsp; On the other hand, I know how much&nbsp; he struggles&nbsp; with&nbsp; not only the&nbsp; effects of the seizures and their effect on his&nbsp; cognition, but&nbsp; the side effects of&nbsp; his meds.&nbsp; I want this for him,&nbsp; to make&nbsp; his&nbsp; life better, and according to his epileptologist, it has a good chance of doing just that.&nbsp; We also&nbsp; found&nbsp;out that day that the Cleveland Clinic will pay for the tests, surgery, everything.. What&nbsp; a Blessing that is! I also&nbsp; got in touch with an old friend of mine that day, after&nbsp; 3 years of not speaking.. We had a falling out, well, actually not we, so much as she&nbsp; just decided to&nbsp; quit speaking to me, Our reconciliation lasted about a week :(&nbsp; It's bummed me&nbsp; out, to tell you the truth, I really did hope we could be&nbsp; friends again.. I hope the surgery&nbsp; situation doesn't&nbsp; end up in similar disappointment&nbsp; If for some reason, you're reading this , friend,. I wish&nbsp; you no ill will, and hope maybe some day you can get your shit together, and we can be friends again.
I have learned something this year : the secret to being&nbsp; happy is to&nbsp;focus what is going well in your life, and&nbsp; what you have to be grateful for.&nbsp; It's good to be able to vent, but that's all that some people do, and it&nbsp; gets old after awhile. My goal for 2009 is to be&nbsp; more positive, and yet more tolerant of negative people. I Also need to go back to work El Pronto. Clark is having test in Cleveland&nbsp; starting the&nbsp; 4th of January. They are going to&nbsp; take&nbsp; him off his meds and monitor him with EEG and cameras. I feel it's very important that I be there, because he gets very confused when off the meds.&nbsp; After that, though, I'm going back to my old job.&nbsp; The Positive me, says I miss my friends there, and i enjoy helping people. It's a start, right?"

Please&nbsp; leave some feedback! <br /><font size=""3""><p>An auburn haired girl sat under the beech tree, outside the campus library, her nose in a book. She was oblivious to the world around her, so when Robin Berkeley's dog stole one of the shoes laying on the ground next to her, she didn't even notice, at first.</p><p>&quot; Marcus!! Bad Dog!! Come here. Sit!!&quot; The black lab mix obediently trotted back to his owner, the contraband in his mouth dropped at his master's feet with a sheepish doggie grin.</p><p>Robin approached the girl with her slightly-the-worse-for-wear shoe. &quot;I'm really sorry about that. Big goofy bastard got away from me&quot;</p><p>Fortunately, the girl didn't look too pissed. &quot;That's ok, I should have been keeping better track of them, I just got caught up in my book.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Warfare at Sea, 1850-1880: Maritime Conflicts and the Transformation of Europe&quot; Sounds..interesting&quot;</p><p>She laughed. &quot;Actually it, is, believe it or not: It's for a class I'm taking.&quot; She took the shoe from him with a bright smile, and Robin felt his heart do a little back flip.</p><p>&quot;I'm Robin&quot; he said, offering the hand that was not attached to Marcus' leash.</p><p>&quot;Phoebe.&quot; she said, taking it. Her hands were warm, and soft, and Robin felt his heart twitch again. &quot;Actually, I have to get to class, but it was nice meeting you..&quot;</p><p>&quot; Hey, um..when you get out of class, would you like to get a cup of coffee, or something?&quot; <i>Oh Geez, Rob, real smooth. </i><p>But Phoebe was nodding. &quot;I'd love to; Meet you back here at a quarter after?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sounds great. I'll see you then.&quot;</p><p>Robin's feet barely touched the earth as he walked Marcus home.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Phoebe McCoy checked her hair in the ladies room mirror as soon as class was over. She didn't want to keep Robin waiting, but a girl's got to look her best, right? She sighed, wishing she looked like one of those Barbie doll types she saw on campus, the ones with perfect hair, perfect makeup, perfect breasts and bodies. The girls who looked put together by professionals, who never had pimples, or cold sores, or ... corns! She laughed ruefully. She was a bit surprised that a guy who looked like Robin had even given her the time of day. <i>It's like polishing a turd</i>. She thought. <i>I don't have so much as a lip gloss on me to improve things</i>. She sighed again, made one last attempt to smooth her hair and went to go meet Robin.</p><p>He was standing under the beach tree outside the library and smiled at her as she approached.</p><p>&quot;Hey, How was class?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, not too bad, I guess.&quot; She smiled wishing he wasn't looking at her so intensely. Maybe she had food on her shirt, or something. If only she didn't feel so self-conscious!</p><p>&quot;Who do you have?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Palmer.&quot;</p><p>He grinned. &quot; He's an pompous ass. I had him last semester.&quot;</p><p>She giggled, &quot;Yeah, maybe. He makes you think, though&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, Student Union, for the coffee?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, that sounds good.&quot;</p><p>They walked towards the Student Center. Robin found himself fascinated with the way the girl moved.. she turned to him, finally.</p><p>&quot; Do I have food in my teeth or something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, no, of course not, why??</p><p>&quot;You keep looking at me so odd.&quot;</p><p>Robin blushed to the roots of his hair. &quot;No, of course not. It's just, well, you're very pretty.&quot;</p><p>She snorted. &quot;Are you kidding me? I got no makeup on, no fashionable clothes, my hair is barely brushed...&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what?&quot; he said. None of that matters a damn to me, if you were a queen bedecked with jewels you wouldn't be any better looking than you are now..&quot;</p><p>She looked at him quizzically. &quot;Do you really mean that?&quot;</p><p>&quot; I do.&quot; Now it was Phoebe's turn to blush. &quot;Screw this.&quot; Robin said. &quot;Let's go back to my place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not to overuse a clich&eacute;, but what kind of girl do you think I am?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dunno,&quot; he said, &quot;but I'd sure like to find out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good enough for me.&quot; she said.</p><p>They headed back to Robin's place.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Five hours later, it was, well, five hours later. Marcus lay curled up, snoring, at their feet. Phoebe couldn't remember the last time she'd felt so comfortable with <i>anybody</i>, let alone a strange guy she'd just met earlier that day. They were sitting cross legged on Robin's battered futon, facing each other, they'd talked about art, politics, music, touched on religion and history, and generally lost all track of the time. The were in the middle of a heated discussion about The Office when Robin finally looked at the clock.</p><p>&quot;Holy Mackerel It's past 8.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You've got to be joking!&quot; But no, the clock told the sad truth. &quot;Aw, I hate that! I really got to be going, though, Oh, Robin, How glad I am that Marcus stole my shoe!&quot; She bent to scratch the sleeping Lab behind one of his floppy ears.</p><p>He walked her to the door. &quot;Not as glad as I am. At the risk of sounding like Scary Stalker Guy it seems as if..&quot;</p><p>&quot;...We've known each other forever?&quot;</p><p>He beamed. &quot;Yes, that's it exactly. When can I see you again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll be at the library tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>They looked at one another, both feeling the connection that needed no words. He took her hand in both of his, and kissed her gently. Their first kiss, the first of many, he hoped, and watched wistfully at the window until she was no longer in sight.</p></p></font>"

The next day, I woke up with a hinky weird feeling that I should check the porch. ""Nahh"" I told myself ""she won't be out there"" ""but you should look"" said the little voice in my brain. Well, I opened my bedroom door &amp; there she was!&nbsp; Josh found her surrounded&nbsp; by dogs, too so he got her just in time. I truly believe it was Divine Intervention.&nbsp; I also believe if&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;can look out for the little sparrows, and my kitty, that I'll be okay too.

Now, I always bleed like someone killed me &amp; I cramp like a bastard, too. The test ( I got it done at a clinic) was negative. I was so disappointed. Also, now I am puzzled. Why is my body acting odd? Medically, I got some very good advice from my Dad, so I am not too worried. Just puzzled. And bummed. If Aunt Flo doesn't come in ernest this week, I have another appointment for a followup pregnancy test. I know there is such a thing as a false negative. I hope that's what it is.</p></font>"

When does it stop being funny?&nbsp; &amp; how do people deal with laughing at something, that&nbsp;, when they stop to think about it, makes them uncomfortable?&nbsp; On the&nbsp; Ferguson clip, listen to the people's laughter, they just don't know how to take what he is saying seriously. They've come to this taping expecting to laugh, but some things are not funny. I know. Alcoholism runs on both sides of my family.. It's destroyed the lives of people i care about.&nbsp; Wreaked havoc on their health, killed them. Is that funny? &nbsp;Is poking the stick at people who are fighting a battle that most people loose funny, no matter what the amount of money they have or the personal choices they've made ?. Craig says no, &amp; I agree. As for the Takai clip, How okay is it to attack someone for their belief, not that I'm saying what Hardaway said is okay, in any way shape or form, I don't agree with that he said,&nbsp; again, this issue hits close to home for me. I have friends and loved ones that self identify as Gay, Straight, Bisexual, asexual.&nbsp; Perhaps the best lesson learned here that it's not okay to hate. it's not okay to hate celebrities, it's not okay to hate homophobes, it's not okay to hate ANYBODY. &amp; hate is not a funny thing. You can hate people's actions, yes. You can hate someone's opinions.&nbsp; Disagreement and dissent ion is the hallmark of intelligent debate. Where do&nbsp; we draw the line at what is not acceptable?&nbsp; Some have argued&nbsp; that Takai is essentially&nbsp; joking about rape here. Is that his point?&nbsp; Is&nbsp;he simply pointing how ludicrous is it to openly voice hateful opinions about&nbsp; homosexual people in this day&nbsp; and&nbsp;age.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can it be said That ""Sometimes the only way to deal with something deadly serous is to try to treat it a little lightly"" (<strong>Mrs Which,</strong> <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>) Certainly we all have done this... Yet everyone has a personal line which they draw when something no longer is funny. Perhaps the best thing&nbsp; to do&nbsp; is respect each other's personal lines.&nbsp; Perhaps. On the other hand,&nbsp; would&nbsp; we become so damn politically correct and censored that people felt afraid to say&nbsp; what they thought for fear of offending someone? It's not a black and white issue.</p>"

"event","Last night I talked to Lara, an acquaintance of mine who used to be married  to my buddy Billy. I've met her once before,  She came to our place one night while him & her were still dating  & I  was living at Chez Geek & I cooked dinner for everybody & she & I bonded over a couple glasses of wine &  discussed things about Billy no one else knows *grin* Besides both knowing *ahem* Billy,  We pretty much have both run in the same social circles.  Anyhow, we talked for a good long time last night, & I  really enjoyed it, It was a nice game of ""Do you remember "" & Oh my Gawd, what happened to so-and-so""?  I look forward to talking to her again, her & Billy split up ages ago, & she's living in Colorado. After I went to bed, I lay there & watched Clark sleeping & I  thought for awhile about our conversation.  She made me realize how different things are now than they were. I have a stable home, I've held down  a job for more than  a year, I'm married & have stayed that way  (at least thus far) There's just no constant drama going on anymore. I guess the Grow-the-Fuck-Up Fairy waved her magic wand  & on some it took & some it didn't.  I miss the people I knew then. Sometimes I miss the person I was then. the severing of some of those relationships gave me a lot of pain.  My phone still works. I'd be glad to hear from any of them, but, somehow,  I doubt I will.  
It was a pretty uneventful weekend. I got some cleaning done Thursday &  Friday & then Friday afternoon Me & Donna went to lunch & to the Thrift store & I got  a new (to me) cordless phone- YAY! No more having to break my fingers trying to dial  a number.
I slept really late today, but i caught the end of the Ohio State/Michigan game, which I  am firmly convinced we won because of my Uncle Robert since it was his Birthday.. 
Well it's the start of another workweek, & I am looking forward to Thanksgiving. Have a good week, GO BUCS!"

"event","<strong>This is a letter from Clark about the circumstances of him getting fired,<br />&nbsp;any advice would be helpful, thanks!&nbsp;<br /></strong><br /><br /><br />I swear to you this speeding ticket was not obtained through negligence or recklessness.<br /><br />I began my employment with (""Rent-a-car"") resolved to never speed in a company car. And for a while, I kept<br />this up. But day after day, I was subjected to comments such as: ""We're always beating you back to<br />the office because you don't speed. We all do it. That policy is no big deal."" (This is not a direct <br />quote, but a conglommeration of dozens of statements.) Like I was a blooming imbecile for obeying the <br />speed limit. No matter what your mindset, hearing such statements repeatedly from everyone around <br />you (supervisors or not) has an impact on you. Any good advertiser can tell you: repetition sells.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that in my driving duties, I was sometimes ordered to follow one of my supervisors in a <br />2nd vehicle without even being told the destination, to save time in hurried circumstances. Often on these<br />trips, I was essentially forced to speed to keep up with my leading, speeding supervisor. For if I was <br />separated from them by traffic, I had no way of knowing where to go next -- which would mean being late, &amp;<br />management wouldn't be happy about that. Of course, this dilemma could be solved by a simple cel phone<br />call, except that I can't afford one &amp; Enterprise doesn't provide them.<br />The worst of the speeding supervisors was Brian. This is in no way meant to indicate<br />that he's an inept driver. Quite the opposite. From his point of view, he knows his limits as a driver, and he<br />enjoys pushing himself to the limit. On a few occasions, he also enjoyed pushing me to (or past) my limits.<br /><br />So ""why am I the one who got ticketed?"", you may be asking. I wish I knew. I have such bad luck, <br />sometimes I think I'm cursed. I wasn't even passing other drivers when either of these tickets occurred. <br />I was simply moving with the flow of traffic. Whenever I go the exact posted speed limit on a freeway, <br />virtually all other drivers zoom past me, some of them irritated-enough to cut me off.<br /><br />I am a safe, consciencious driver. Unfortunately, I've found that on Columbus (&amp; vicinity) freeways, brief <br />speeding is sometimes essential to not missing your exit -- due in some cases to poor sign placement, <br />in other cases to having your view of the signs blocked by SEMI trucks in front of &amp; beside of you. I've<br />also found that on Columbus freeways, brief speeding is sometimes essential to avoiding an accident <br />due to the negligent or reckless actions of other drivers. I have yet to have a collision in a Rent-a-car <br />vehicle, but I can tell you there have been at least 2 occasions on which one probably would have occurred<br />had I not briefly sped to prevent it. I think it's safe to say I served (""Rent-a-car"")'s wants &amp; needs<br />on those occasions, in spite of having to break company policy to do it.<br /><br /><br />REGUARDING MY 7/19/06 SPEEDING TICKET:<br />This is the most complex issue this letter addresses, and I think you'll find if you put yourself in my <br />shoes, it could happen to you just as easily. Chances are, if this tale doesn't infuriate you, it'll <br />probably amuse you.<br /><br />I was driving along on I-270 at a speed that kept me with the flow of traffic. Traffic in most lanes <br />was heavy (including a few SEMI's), which made me feel as though I needed to divert into the less <br />crowded fast lane, for my assignment did have a deadline. As I moved into a construction area <br />(indicated by orange markers), I looked diligently for speed reduction signs, while continuing to <br />glance at my speedometer every 2 - 3 seconds, as is my habit. I saw no such signs, &amp; naturally<br />presumed the only speed thwe law could hold me to was the last one posted where drivers could<br />see it (65 mph).<br /><br />When in the fast lane, one tends to be more of a driving hazard if one does not speed (at least a<br />little), so I proceeded at 70 mph (to my knowledge, 5 mph over the limit -- &amp; I'd never met anyone <br />pulled over for that), with intent to slow down as soon as I was able to get out of the fast lane. <br />However, I never got that chance, as a moment later, a free-standing traffic cop (with his patrol<br />car parked in the left shoulder) waved me over. Another civilian vehicle was parked on the <br />shoulder adjacent to the patrol car, so just a split-second earlier, I had presumed the officer wasn't<br />finished with him, yet. I concluded that if I didn't stop, he was going to chase me, so I pulled over.<br /><br />When he told me I was in a 55 mph zone, I was astounded. ""What?!"", was my 1st response. <br />I then told him there were no such speed limit signs behind me -- that the nearest signs said 65. <br />He swore there were 2 such signs in the past 2 miles. I didn't believe him, but my memory (both <br />short &amp; long term) has always had some peculiar flaws, so I am forced to doubt myself. This is<br />why I am so detail-oriented. However, I happened to encounter another rent-a-car driver/car prep<br />3 days later when she had brief business at my branch. She told me she remembered seeing<br />me on the 19th on I-270 &amp; wanted to thank me for slowing to let her into my lane (This was before<br />I got into the fast lane.). She also said she remembered seeing me get pulled over a few minutes<br />later, &amp; when I spoke of the elleged speed reduction signs I never saw, she said she never saw <br />them, either. I had already decided to contest this ticket in court, but she was elderly &amp; I didn't<br />want to burden her with a court appearance. All I know of her is her first name is Betty. Anyway,<br />this brief conversation with Betty made me far more convinced in the long run that the elleged <br />signs were never actually there.<br /><br />Anyway, the officer said: ""I clocked you once at 71 and once at 73."" If that's even true, I can <br />swear that either it was only for a split second while my eyes were on traffic rather than my <br />speedometer, or this Enterprise vehicle's speedometer was reading a little off the mark.<br /><br />One might say I should have demanded the officer show me the elleged signs before writing the <br />ticket. This actually crossed my mind for a split second. I didn't for 3 reasons.<br />1. It would have delayed me for at least another 25 minutes, undoubtedly causing customer<br />dissatisfaction &amp; making both me &amp; my branch look bad.<br />2. If the officer even consented, it would have angered him, likely resulting in a larger fine if <br />the speed reduction signs were there (My view on the 1st pass could simply have been blocked<br />by SEMI trucks, I thought at this time.).<br />3. I incorrectly thought at this time that it took 3(not 2) tickets to get me fired.<br />American courts tend to hinge more on how much money you spend on a lawyer than they do on <br />the truth &amp; I had no money to spend on a lawyer. I knew from past experience that appearing in <br />court was my only chance to work off the fine through community service rather than paying cash.<br />That's what I did for the February ticket in Dublin. Also, for a ticket a few years earlier in another<br />county, the magistrate had to dismiss the citation altogether simply because the ticketing officer <br />failed to show up at the court proceeding. These were my hopes.<br /><br />When I showed up for court on 8/9/06, I was called up to the prosecutor to enter a plea (before <br />court proceedings began). Being without representation, I had only the prosecutor's word to rely<br />on as to what plea was in my best interests to enter. She told me entering a plea of ""not guilty""<br />meant that the matter would not be resolved today. Rather, I'd have to return at a later date for <br />trial (Today was just a hearing/arrainment.)(more court costs). Thus, I learned that different <br />counties use vastly different procedures. The prosecutor next told me that if I pled ""guilty"" and<br />just paid the $130 fine, she would work it so that there would be no points added to my driver's <br />license. But I wouldn't get to present my version of events to the court. I came to get my say.<br />I asked if I'd be allowed to pay the fine in 3 separate installments. She said yes.<br />She said if I pled ""no contest"" that I wouldn't actually be admitting guilt &amp; would have to pay a <br />fine &amp; court costs, but would have a chance of getting the fine reduced, &amp; that procedure would <br />require that the magistate ask me to present my version of events, if I wanted to. The <br />prosecutor clearly confirmed this twice at my request. I was as anal as anal can be about <br />avoiding any miscommunications in this matter. So I entered a plea of ""no contest"".<br /><br />When called before the magistrate, with barely an utterance out of my mouth (a confirmation of <br />my plea, I believe), the magistrate clearly stated my sentence is to be a $30 fine + $75 court <br />costs. I told her of my low financial status &amp; asked if I could work off the fine through community<br />service. She said no. I asked if I would have the option to pay the fine in, say, 3 separate <br />installments to make it easier on my budget. She said yes. She never asked me to present my<br />version of events. I didn't press it, because all things considered, a $30 fine was apparently the <br />best deal I could have hoped for, &amp; if I angered her by ""wasting the court's time"", she probably <br />would've ammended that sentence to something worse.<br /><br />So, we've established that the prosecutor told me a lie about procedure which influenced my <br />decision about which plea to enter --- or that the magistrate simply violated that procedure.<br /><br />I next proceeded to the deputy court clerk within the courtroom (as instructed) to complete<br />paperwork pertaining to the results of this proceeding. The clerk told me the total bill was $130, <br />same as the original ticket. A little too convenient, if you ask me. And way off what the magistrate<br />said, just a couple minutes ago. So I demanded to know the details of this equasion. For starters,<br />the paperwork handed over to this clerk by the magistrate states a $50(not $30) fine. Add $75 court <br />costs and this still leaves $5 unaccounted for. So, clearly grasping at straws, the clerk then told <br />me there's a $5 ""continuence fee"". He claims this is for the 3 month payment extention I <br />requested, but as soon as I've made it clear to him that I intend to pay this in installments, he's <br />telling me it is not permissible to pay this in installments -- that it must be paid LUMP SUM <br />(only at a later date). <br /><br />Now it's been established that the magistrate lied to me from the bench. She could not have <br />misunderstood my question. I was quite precise. Of course, it's too late for me to change my plea. <br />To continue: I responded to the deputy clerk: ""Well that won't help me at all. I'd rather just pay it <br />all today."" He next indicated quite clearly to me that if I pay it all today, the $5 fee will be removed.<br />Yet somehow, the final total remained the same. He then told me he had almost forgot there was a<br />second (although 1st, chronologically) continuance fee, reguarding my request for a change in the <br />date of my arrainment. ""That wasn't a request for a continuance, I was requesting that my court <br />date be moved up, not back,"" I said. ""well, apparently the magistrate saw it as one,"" he replied.<br /><br />Thus, the final bill remained $130. How suspiciously convenient. This court is corrupt.<br /><br />Imagine how you'd feel if you got stuck with an 18 mph over the speed limit ticket when you had <br />every reason to believe you were only going 5 mph over it (&amp; briefly) --- a violation for which I <br />wouldn't have gotten pulled over, considering other drivers right next to me were going at least 10 <br />mph over the limit (65 in the elleged 55).<br /><br />I've sought legal council on the prospect of suing Franklin County over this, and been told that<br />although my complaint is valid, no one will take the case because it is simply unwinnable.<br />However, the search goes on.<br /><br />I loved my job at (""Rent-a-car""), and losing it has devestated me both financially and emotionally.<br />I would swear to the above facts on a stack of Bibles &amp; on my grandmother's grave. And anyone <br />who has worked with me for a signifigant length of time can tell you I'm honest to a fault (I'm <br />sure some of them even make fun of me over it.).<br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Clark D. Andrews<br />5920 Maple Canyon Ave. Apt. E<br />Columbus, OH 43229<br /><br />(614) 899-1542<br /><br />artofclark@hotmail.com <br /><br />P.S.-- If you have any suggestions that you think might help bring justice to this situation,<br />please contact me.<br />"

"event","Wow, I'm tired... It's all I can do to stay awake... I was up at 10 am, &amp; I tried to take a nap before work, but I couldn't fall asleep, so I ended up laying awake listening to SVU for an hour.. So now I'm at work, fighting sleep.. Pretty busy weekend, Wednesday we were going to go to&nbsp;some nearby caverns (&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.olentangyindiancaverns.com"">http://www.olentangyindiancaverns.com</a>) but they were closed by the time we got there, so we settled on going there thursday. Thursday we went and checked out the caverns (really cool) &amp; after we went &amp; saw a Movie..Click. Great movie, buut don' <br />t expcet a comedy.. Still it really had a great message: life's too damn short, a lesson compounded thursday night, when i found out about Paul... I really haven't quite come to terms with that yet... I do know if he could see what it's done for the board, where everybody is pulling together, comforting each other, becoming even closer, well, i think he'd be pleased. Friday I baked a loaf of bread, did a little housecleaning, &amp; bought some soil at Lowes &amp; planted an herb garden I started earlier this week. I'm growing garlic, sweet basil, oregano, rosemarry, purple sage &amp;peppermint.. Looks nice. Tonight I took a few clippings of the basil &amp; made a nice pesto for chicken, which turned out yummy, I hope they grow... I'm not great with plants. We played Star Wars RISK too.. fun! anyway, now I am a sleepy hippie &amp; I'm counting the minutes till 8 am.. Goodnight!"

"event","<p>Well, here I am at work, <font color=""#00ff00"">yuk</font>, but I thought if I actually posted an entry, it might make the time pass faster. I need to get some stuff to put in my cubicle at work, not that 's it's "" official"", mind you, but, according to the powers that be, we do get to kinda call 'dibs' for our spaces back here in Product Lab &amp; so far, all I have in mine is my posted schedule &amp; my notebook &amp; folder. I'm glad that nobody's taken my stuff yet, I keep leaving it &amp; &amp; since it seems to be safe, I'd like to maybe bring a picture or two from home, or something. I did end up buying that chair, but it BROKE less than a week later! Arg stupid <font color=""#000000"">#^(</font><font color=""#000000"">*&amp;$#</font> cheapass $#!*! &amp; Waterbeds n' Stuff wouldn't give me my money back either, I got store credit, so I bought some things for my living room, to change it's look a bit. I wish I had been able to get the money, because I ended up being overdrawn on my account, &amp; I have to straighten up that this payday. Speaking of accounts, Yahoo has Yanked mine. WHY!? I sent them an email about it, but all I got in return was one of those stupid automated things in return, I sent another, but I haven't heard back from them yet, so If you're on my yahoo buddylist &amp; you don't hear from me for awhile, well, that's why :( this is my last night of work this week, seems like the week has just flown by. I ended up liking this 4 day on, 3 day off schedule a lot more than I thought I would. The nights seem long at the time, but it's not really so bad. I'm going to try to get some new glasses tomorrow. Mine broke a few weeks ago, &amp; I've been wearing an old pair. I hope I can find ones I like I seem to see fewer &amp; fewer frames at the store that suit my face, the teeny little granny frames just don't do it for me. I have always put a lot of thought into the glasses I get because I <strong>must</strong> wear them ALL the time.&nbsp; Hope all is well with you guys out there in eljayland.<br />Peace.<br />Janis<br /></p>"

"event","<p>After getting absofrikkinlutely <strong>NOTHING </strong>done yesterday, except to mend a pair of pants (Yay! I have my hoochie-mama jeans back!) I was a busy Beth today. I picked up &amp; cashed my paycheck (and two other checks) , Scrubbed my stove, cleaned my living room, did my dishes, wiped the counters, cleaned the garbage disposal, dusted, mopped the floor &amp; went out to eat &amp; window shopping. I didn't get very much sleep today, but it was worth it. After picking up my check, &amp; getting my housework done, i went to bed for awhile. Tonight was Date night, so when Clark got home, he woke me so we could get ready &amp; Go out.. First stop was Wal-Mart. I wanted to get my ears re-pierced. The holes are still open, but I want some piercing studs, so my earrings won't fall out &amp; get lost anymore, but alas, where I have been wearing cheapo earrings, one of my hole is widened from being repeatedly irritated &amp; is about to split. *sigh* I ended up getting a pair of small clasp type hoops ( 14K gold ) to keep in them till they heal, i also got the cleaning solution, &amp; I'm going to put neosporin on my earlobe too, I knew my ear was a bit sore, but I never thought it was in that bad a shape.. lesson, kiddies: Don't wear cheap earrings for long periods of time. I also got a pair of 14k ball earrings to go in the top, &amp; hypo-allergenic ones for the bottom. Clark bought me flowers to cheer me up. I mean it was such a little silly thing,&nbsp;but, &nbsp;he wanted to make me feel better. i really don't know how I got so lucky. Anyway, there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.waterbedsnstuff.com/browse.cfm/4,132.htm""> leather chair I want to buy at Waterbeds N stuff</a> but I had spend exactly too much of the ear stuff to get it.. Clark woulda loaned me a few bucks, but i was&nbsp; a bit torn about making such&nbsp; a large purchase anyway. But you know what, I loaned a friend a bit of money &amp; He's going to pay me back this week &amp;&nbsp; i&nbsp; am going to get it tomorrow.&nbsp; Period. No more pussy-ing around.<br />After that we went out to eat at Chilli's. Everything was yummers. The food was so good Clark didn't even bitch about the bill *L*<br />Well, I'm going to 'moke a cigarette,&nbsp; call my buddy Tim &amp; go to bed... Been a pretty productive day.</p>"

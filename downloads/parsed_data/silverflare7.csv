"event","This is mainly in reply to Mike's comment on my last post, but it also contains some other random stuff.

    Lets see here I meet guys by going out with some friends who actually know a few.  This doesn't work very well though because one of these people is very insecure and thinks i will ""steal"" the guys, therefore I was only invited to go out with them twice.  However, both times I managed to meet like 3 guys and actually hold real conversations with a few, enough to consider them a friend. So basically yes I've been talking to boys, but thats about all that it amounts to, none will ever call considering they don't have my number and I'll probably won't be invited to go out with those ""friends"" any time soon.

    I've actually been talking to like 6 of the Davidson ppl a lot, its rather a lot of fun, and is the only thing that sustains me through the school week. I posted my sn on college confidential so one kid found me through that, then we made a myspace group and 4 more ppl found me through that.  The kid that found me through college confidential's hallmates friend was also accepted ED so thats how I met him.  Oh and the last is actually my godfathers nephew....When we were at my godfathers house about a yr and a half ago everyone there was asking me all about colleges so of course I used the opportunity to inform them about the exquisiteness of Davidson.  Well apparently I was so convincing that I convinced his mom to force him to apply Early Decision....he got in.  I don't even know if he wants to go there, i feel really badly because its all my fault, I could have just shut up; though, I didn't know his mom was a phsyco.  I still have to e-mail this last kid but I keep putting it off.  I barely talked to him when we were at my godfathers house because I was embarrassed. He seemed rather shy and weird...he kept talking about kung fu.

    One of my best friends, Lauren, has gotten a boy friend but she gets bored going out on single dates so she drags me along. The guy is a redneck/hick.  He has this 6 tire truck with a special radio to talk to other trucks, lights on long poles above his truck, and two flags attached to the back.  One flag is the confederate flag, the other is a confederate flag with a picture of a country singer on it...I think Harry Willson Sr.  So we've been going and doing really hickish things lately.  So far I have attended the rodeo twice, which I didn't even know existed in Tampa, gone fishing, and played pool 3 times.  We've also gone out to eat a lot but thats normal.  This Saturday he [Gerrit] is dragging Lauren and I to a monster truck show.  I don't really mind any of these things and I'm open to trying new things, but recently he took her to watch the drag racing over on Gandy.  I feel like this is out of line, he should have a little more concern for her, don't the police break them up regularly and arrest everyone who is there, even if they are bystanders?"

    I actually have no idea what I want to major in, I'm kinda leaning towards physics, history or philosphy... but I dunno.  I think physics may be too hard, history has no job potential, and philosphy is too abstract without definite answers.
    So I seem to be getting out a lot more this year for some reason.  And I've actually been randomly meeting guys GASP.  Somehow losers always seem to find me and get attached, I'm beginning to think its because I'm nice to them like I am to everyone else.  I don't really have the heart to tell them off until they get annoying.  My one friend jokes that I've started rubbing off onto her and now shes begun to pick up losers top.  Its like a disease we don't do anything at all, they just find us.  Whatever
    I've met like 6 other Davidson ppl so far, one is from Columbia and one is from London.  The girls seem rather boring, but I've become friends with 2 of the guys.  One asks really random questions like, what is you biggest flaw, and what is your biggest pet peeve, its kinda weird but amusing.
There is currently a rumor going around my school that I am going to become a nun.  The most ironic part of it is my best friend started it accidentally.  Whats really weird is even after i deny becoming a nun, ppl come up to me and are like, i don't believe you... you will become a nun.  I'm just like ok whatever you say...  At first I thought it was funny, now the little pointed comments in class like, sister, do you have a nun radar -while staring at me- are getting kinda annoying. Now whenever i go out people comment on the cut of my clothes and how my shirts always have high necklines, thats really really annoying, i could just as easily be like well you're a slut with your boobs always hanging out.
haha, ok i'm done ranting"

"event","I disagree on principle with acting fakely, I always try not to be outright mean to people but I usually can't hide my emotions well enough to conceal my dislike.  Even if I could I don't think that people should, I'm not saying people should be mean or anything I'm just saying people should not feign to be friends and to like each other when they don't.  People who dislike eachother of course shouldn't act coldly but perhaps simply with nonchalance regarding the other person, neither purposely offending them or including them.  Of course in my mind this all sounds a lot better than it actually happens in my life.  I am so bad at concealing my feelings that when i dislike people everyone who has known me for any length of time can tell.  I must say that I tend to act in a cold manner towards these people, and am not usually outright mean to them unless I get really annoyed.  I must work on this.  I guess it sort of makes me feel more powerful when I am mean to them, like haha i can ridicule you to your face and you don't even realize it...but everyone else does.  I have noticed a general trend over the years of first regarding everyone with ease, to some coldly, to now treating some coldly and talking meanly about others.  I have not yet progressed to the point where I treat others outright evil to their face, instead I live vicariously by telling others what I would do if i was a truly mean spirited person.  Well, I hope that i am not a hypocrite and I try really hard to acurately represent myself and my feelings...but, I absolutely HATE people who hid their feelings, who say one thing and mean another, who are mad but don't show it and who pretend to like you when they really hate you.  

Sorry just needed to vent....an incidence did bring this on...but now i'm kinda over it...maybe i'll write about it some other time...maybe not
    Essentially my best friend from last year whom i talked to on the phone almost every night and got together with at least twice a week, she has a torn family so we accepted her into our home and always fed her too, well she's is entirely ignoring me, now she's started to leave me out of things that she invites the whole grade to, and she stole my christmas formal date (sorta) and now is trying to pass him off like a piece of trash. This all makes me really mad.  She applied ED to Princeton, if she gets in there is something seriously wrong with the world, and i may lose faith in it forever:(
God I hope I get into Davidson to get away from this crap."

I spend hours on the computer looking up statistics, only I can't find any new ones so I just read the old ones over and over again.  Help!

"event","# You get extra credit for bringing in food for a food day, only kids try to get Beta hours instead, like they are a bartering tool.
# You would rather socialize in class and instead come in at 7AM on monday morning to take the test.
# You can tell what store every piece of clothing someone is wearing came fom, and most can tell exactly when they wore it last.
# You know everyone's cousins and grandparents.
# You try to pick up hot guys at borders.
# The highlight of the week are the smoothies on Fridays
# Teachers give up teaching on Fridays after lunch; others teach into lunch and get insulted when you leave
# You haven't washed your uniform in weeks.
# Your hair is so nasty a teacher thinks its wet.
# You know the head of the science department and the college counselors extension by heart.
# You are on a first name basis with the janitors, they're like your second parents.
# You've broken into school on a weekend or before 6.
# You know the love lives of all your teachers.
# Anything below a 97 is failing.
# You skip lunch more than you eat it (not optionaly).
...I can think of tons more...."

"event","There is this hilarious list that people have been posting on myspace and i thought i would share.  Its a list of 100 ways that you know that you go to Academy, i can't find it now so i'll post it later, but here are a few of my own.
# Someone suggests you become a nun and by the next day everyone thinks you are joining a convent instead of going to college.
# You have to think about all the boys that you've met since freshman year and realize that you still have no one to ask to Christmas Formal...and your friends are taking their brothers.
# Your former best friend asks your Christmas Formal date from the year before to Christmas Formal...only they've never met and she's only going off what you said about him when you used to like him...Your anger at her ""back-stabbing"" ..you were planning on asking him.. maybe.. making ya'll dates for three out of 5 dances in high school."

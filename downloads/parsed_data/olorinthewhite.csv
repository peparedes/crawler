"event","The state of Illinois sued the Dave Matthews Band on Tuesday for allegedly dumping up to 800 pounds of liquid human waste from a bus into the Chicago River, dousing a tour boat filled with passengers.

The lawsuit accuses the band and one of its bus drivers of violating state water pollution and public nuisance laws. It seeks $70,000 in civil penalties.

""Our driver has stated that he was not involved in this incident,"" band spokesman John Vlautin said in a statement. He said the band ""will continue to be cooperative in this investigation."" 

According to the lawsuit, on Aug. 8 a bus leased by the band was heading to a downtown hotel where members were staying. As the bus crossed the Kinzie Street bridge, the driver allegedly emptied the contents of the septic tank through the bridge's metal grating into the river below.

More than 100 people on an architecture tour were showered with foul-smelling waste. The attorney general's office said no one was seriously injured.

""This incident may be unique, but that does not lessen the environmental or public health risks posed by the release of at least 800 pounds of liquid human waste into a busy waterway and onto a crowded tour boat,"" Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a statement.

After the incident, the boat's captain turned the vessel around and took passengers back to the dock. Everyone received refunds, and the boat was cleaned with disinfectant.

After all, the Dave Matthews Band really is nothing but 800 lbs. of human waste. ;)"

"event","Last night, well, actually early this morning, i watched this movie that was very... different... it was called <i>Secretary</i>.. it was about this girl who used to be a mental patient, and she became a secretary intern, I guess, for this man in a law firm, and eventually... their relationship goes way beyond anything that belongs in the office... every time she makes a typo in letters, he yells at her, and after a while, he started developing feelings for her... strange ones at best... and when she made a typo, he asked her to lean over onto his desk and read the memo... and every time she would get to a typo, he would spank her.  She was shocked at first, but then she really liked it a lot... it was basically about a dominant/submissive relationship... it was hillarious... in the end, the two get married, and end happily ever after... even though it's very strange... but happy the way they like it anyhow. =)

Also, I found out what was wrong with my car windshield.  You see, every time it rains, and i'm driving at night.. and headlights of oncoming traffic hit my windshield, the whole thing lights up like a giant flourescent light that you see in the ceilings of offices.

That isn't supposed to happen.  I wasn't able to see when it rained so hard, and I would have to pull off the road until it calmed down.  Well, I thought there was some kind of substance on the windshield, but after I have been scrubbing my knuckles bare for about half a year... I decided to finally go and ask a professional.  The guy stood 10 feet (that's a little over 3 meters for you metric people) away from my car and told me the problem.  He said it was ""sand-pitted.""  That basically means that tiny grains of sand have embedded themselves in the windshield, and the only way to fix the problem is to replace the entire windshield.  I asked for an estimate, and he said it would be about $496.92... thanks to my insurance company... the normal list price was about $800.  So I called my insurance agent, and asked him what I would have to actually pay, and he told me it would only be a $100 deductible.  So, now, I am trying to get $100 saved up before I leave for my trip to Florida in July... I'm leaving July 21, and I hope to have $300 saved up for my vacation... so I need to come up with $100 sometime before then... so I need to save up about $400 between now and then.  Right now, I only have about $95 saved... I don't know how I'm gonna do it, but I have to. =)"

"event","Ronald Wilson Reagan dies at 93...

Sunday, June 6, 2004; Page B06 


RONALD REAGAN'S was perhaps the most personal of all American presidencies, in the sense that it derived from the firsthand experiences -- personal and tangible -- of the president himself. This isn't to say that Mr. Reagan, who died yesterday at the age of 93, put his stamp on every aspect of his administration -- far from it. Mr. Reagan's inattentiveness to detail, as well as to some fairly major goings-on, was well known, and in at least one instance -- what came to be known as the Iran-contra scandal -- it hurt him, his administration and the country. But on the things that mattered most to him and that turned out to matter most to the country, he was both decisive and influenced to an unusual degree by what he had himself seen and done over the years. 

  
 
Many regarded this trait as evidence of his naivete or linked it to his frequent use of dubious anecdotes and his occasional confusion of reality with movieland myth. They might be amused, or appalled, at the idea that his fervent anticommunism -- with all its implications for foreign policy -- could have had its roots in something so parochial as Mr. Reagan's battles with communists over leadership of the Screen Actors Guild. Never mind that a number of respected and influential figures in the last century -- George Orwell being a prime example -- had their own very personal epiphanies on communism, or that Mr. Reagan came, by whatever path, to an insight that eluded many intellectuals in the West far too long. 

Mr. Reagan could speak with surprising certitude, and a fine disregard for the striped-pants niceties, about the Communist ""evil empire"" and its ensured eventual consignment to the ash heap of history. He waged his battles for tax reductions with the righteous dedication of one who had been personally nicked by the country's confiscatory postwar income tax rates (and who, somewhat characteristically, hadn't hidden his money in tax shelters). His determination to dispel the specter of nuclear weapons probably stemmed more from his reading of the Book of Revelation than from any briefings or position papers. It led to his insistence on creating a shield against ballistic missiles, which many thought simply preposterous. 

""Many"" refers here, of course, to a large segment of the permanent capital -- people in government, journalism, think tanks, lobbying, law -- whose frame of reference was never quite able, even after two administrations, to accommodate Ronald Reagan in the role of president. In the land of the quick, articulate and thoroughly briefed, Mr. Reagan seemed out of his depth from the day of his first press conference as president -- obviously not conversant with the subject matter that was being thrown at him from all directions, evasive, fumbling, off-balance. 

To a great part of the country, it didn't matter. Mr. Reagan soon showed that although he hadn't mastered the presidential press conference -- a comparatively recent art form that may not be quite as important a measure of a chief executive's worth as some of us think -- he was more than capable of reaching the people when he could get himself alone in front of a camera and give a proper scripted speech. His physical courage and his conduct on the day he was shot outside a Washington hotel earned the country's admiration early on. His ability to rise to the occasion in his addresses -- on the 40th anniversary of D-Day in France, after the space shuttle disaster, before the British Parliament, in front of the Berlin Wall -- was not simply an attribute of a good politician; it fulfilled one of the most important functions of the presidency. Mr. Reagan reaffirmed the basic beliefs of people in the words he spoke, and he sounded like a president who believed what he said. 

Before his election in 1980, Mr. Reagan was asked what he thought voters saw in him. ""Would you laugh if I told you that I think, maybe, they see themselves, and that I'm one of them?"" he said. ""I've never been able to detach myself or think that I, somehow, am apart from them."" In Mr. Reagan's case, this was not the testimony of a flesh-pressing, hail-fellow man of the people. People who knew him about as well as he could be known said he wasn't given to deep friendships or easy confidences. He was distant, in many ways a mystery to those who sought to understand or explain him. But he linked up with the people at an essential level: He thought this a basically good country, and so did they. Mr. Reagan had, from boyhood, a sunny, almost obstinate optimism of the kind that is very much a part of the mental makeup of the nation. He made a connection, and the power he drew from it provided the motivating force of his presidency -- the source of its major accomplishments and some of its shortcomings. 

Mr. Reagan will forever be seen by certain of his adversaries as an easily manipulated executive, something of a figurehead, fronting for the traditional interests of his party. This view fails to take into account how forceful, focused and sometimes stubbornly personal Mr. Reagan was regarding the basic matters on which his administration will be judged. His own predilections on taxes were bolstered by a powerful strain of thought among Republicans, creating momentum for the large reductions that rolled to enactment in his first term. The cuts, combined with the defense buildup that was also a major item on the Reagan agenda, led to growing deficits, which inevitably struck hard at services for the poor, especially during the deep recession of the early 1980s. A lot of people were hurt by these policies, a fact that in our view did not weigh heavily enough on this president. His intermittent denigration of government, and of people who depended on government services, fed into and bolstered hurtful and unfair stereotypes. But unlike some of the more committed among his following, Mr. Reagan was willing to compromise on taxes when the deficits began to mount, and in 1986 he cooperated in enacting a much-needed comprehensive reform of income tax law. 

This same ability to change course when the situation merited it was the key to what will surely be the most enduring achievement of the Reagan administration: its contribution to the peaceful dismantling of Communist rule over Eastern Europe and Russia and the dramatic agreements on arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union. People will debate for years the causes of the Soviet empire's fall -- did it collapse from within, or did the American administration play a major role? But what seems reasonably clear is that Mr. Reagan played his part in the Cold War endgame with both steadfastness and the necessary degree of flexibility. He had come to office with some rather shocking gaps in his knowledge of national security matters -- there were indications he believed for a time that submarine-launched missiles could be recalled. But he could be a quick study, and certainly in the final years of the Cold War, the longtime anticommunist did a graceful turnabout in seizing the opportunity presented by the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev as leader of the Soviet Union and potential negotiating partner. 

Astrong argument can be made that Mr. Reagan played a vital role in creating the conditions in which the Cold War could be ended without major upheaval or conflict and in advancing the cause of freedom in lands that hadn't known it for four decades, if ever. He did so through his arms buildup, his firm position on intermediate-range missiles in Europe -- continuing the policy of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter -- and other acts conveying his intention to enhance and maintain the country's strength. It's easy to forget now how powerful the sentiment was among many Western opinion makers against placing intermediate-range missiles in Western Europe to counter the Soviets' installation of similar weapons. It was the time of the ""nuclear freeze"" movement. Mr. Reagan thought we could do better than just a freeze, and in the end we -- and the rest of the world -- did. 

Fourteen years after his election as president, and nearly a decade ago, Mr. Reagan made his final statement to the public: an announcement in November 1994 that he suffered from Alzheimer's disease. It was brief and practical-minded (""we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition""). It was also, quite typically, hopeful. ""I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead,"" Mr. Reagan concluded, showing a pretty fair awareness, in the face of a dread diagnosis, of what the American people expect, and sometimes must have, from a president."

Jun 3, 1:28 PM EST

The Associated Press

Long before she exposed her right breast to the world during the Super Bowl halftime show, Janet Jackson says she had thoughts about sex.

""As I've gotten older, I've come to realize that I had a very active sexual mind at a very young age. I hope that doesn't sound bad,"" Jackson tells Blender magazine for its June/July issue.

""My first crush was on Barry Manilow. He performed on television, and I remember taping it.
When no one was around, I used to kiss the screen.""

Jackson also recalls having a ""major crush"" on Teddy Pendergrass when she was 12.

""I thought he was singing to me,"" says the singer, now 38. ""When you're a kid, you have little fantasies, but I saw myself being with him as an adult, not as a kid.""

Now, Jackson says she expresses more grown-up urges through one of her alter egos, named Strawberry: ""She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest.""

The other character living inside her is Damita Jo, which is her middle name and the title of her latest album. Damita Jo, she says, is ""a lot harsher, and quick to put you in your place.""


----

aren't the Jackson's special people?  This just confirms... Janet Jackson is <I>VERY SPECIAL</I>... yes, she is f***ed up in the head.  And she basically told the press it was true, so it is true.  This just confirms what we've known forever.  I don't wanna run into no Strawberry Jackson or Damita Jo Jackson... she's just too damn scary. =)"

Well, it's 10:30, and I only have 30 mins left until Spider-Man comes on again on MTV2oons late Friday night... I can't wait!  I hope it is a continuation of last week's episode!

Oh, and when I talked about Aeon Flux and the creator of Reign: The Conqueror... that man is Peter Chung.  Great artist, I love his work. =)

Anyhow, I'll shut up for now.... Dat Phan will be on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno tomorrow night, and will have his own comedy show... so I'm extremely happy.  It was fun watching Last Comic Standing. =)"

I can't think of anything to do a story on that I haven't already done already... another big down side to being a ""big time reporter,"" (as Presdient Bush would say) in a small town, is that sometimes, there isn't anything to report.  There are only 5 of us in the news department, and we all pretty much cover everything.  If we could just start running an entertainment section, I would absolutely <i>love</i> that.

This afternoon, I just want to lay down and watch some TV.  I am addicted to Adult Swim, and of course, Teen Titans as usual.  I hope this afternoon goes by quickly.  5:00 p.m. can't get here soon enough, i tell ya!  I added my friends Brandon and Dayton to my friends' livejournal page.  It's been a while since I've talked to Dayton.. I've just been so very busy.... I wish I was busy today.  When I'm not busy, the afternoon always seems to crawl by at a snail's pace. >_<"

"event","Well, I've been watching the Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King for the past two hours... it's now 9:23 p.m., and I have to go to work tomorrow.  Right now, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Merry and Pippen are riding towards the Black Gate, calling out Sauron's Army.  I tried to help Dave make a flash presentation for his class, but it screwed up, after 2 hours of work on it.  I am still pissed... and I have a headache.  I think this full stereo-entertainment system blasting the movie isn't helping that much.  I would serve under Aragorn if I had to.  He's a great King portrayed through the novels.

""I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me!  The day may come when the courage of men fails and we foresake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship... but it is not this day!  An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of Men comes crashing down... But it is not this day!  This day we fight!!  By all that you hold dear on this good earth... I bid you stand!  MEN OF THE WEST!!!!!!!!! *all of the armies of the West draw swords*... Aragorn looks back at the Army of the West and says quietly: ""For Frodo."" then charges head first into the remainder of Sauron's armies as they pour through the Black Gate..... Frodo barely makes it halfway up Mount Doom at the very same moment*

Best quote in the whole dang movie is from Sam, when Frodo grows extremely weak on the footsteps of Doom....

Sam:""Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?  It'll be spring soon.  And the orchards will be in blossom and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.  And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields and eating the first of the strawberries with cream... do you remember the taste of strawberries?""  

Frodo: ""NO Sam, I can't recall the taste of food...nor the sound of water... nor the touch of grass.  I'm... naked in the dark.  There's -- there's nothing... no veil between me and the wheel of fire... I can see him... with my waking eyes!!""  

Sam: Then let us be rid of it... once and for all!  

Come on Mr. Frodo... I can't carry it for you.... BUT I CAN CARRY YOU!  COME ON!""  *Sam picks up Frodo and suffers the way up the slope to the Cracks of Doom*

That made me cry when I saw it at the Summit at 2 or so in the morning... and it makes me cry every time I watch it at home.  That is one of the best acting sequences of this year... of this decade. =)  Sean Astin rules.  Viggo Mortenson rules... and of course, Sir Ian McKellen rules. =)

Dangit I love this movie so much! =)"

The Zealot is the vampire that is utterly addicted<br>to what it is. Overcome by the sensations and<br>capabilities it possesses, it exists to simply<br>enjoy anything and everything pertaining to its<br>heightened vampire existence; it lusts for all<br>things available to it, blood, sex, power,<br>money, immortality. Neither identifiably<br>well-intentioned or malicious, these are<br>trivial matters to the zealot, as its existence<br>is focused on the sensations it can achieve.<br>The zealot always appears most seductive and<br>alluring, an utter sex symbol. As it is always<br>pushing the limits of what it can do for the<br>sheer pleasure of doing so, often it can be a<br>very powerful vampire, simply from the sheer<br>experience of its addiction.

Dominant personality trait: Lust<br>
Dominant color: Red<br>

"event","Well, well, it seems that everybody's favorite teen queen, Lindsey Lohan, has joined the ranks of those who have had their breasts exposed in public.  She's only what, 17 years old right now?  She's supposed to turn 18 in July or something like that... however, there are pictures floating around on the internet of her exposed nipple.  Man, she is only 17, and for a girl that young, she is incredibly mind-blowingly hot.  I'd love to get to meet her sometime.

The supposive nipple-slip happened when she was exiting a vehicle, going to attend a party.  She was wearing a spaghetti-strap top with no bra on.  She was just asking for her boobs to pop out.  Apparently, the top came loose, while she was talking on her cell phone, and she didn't realize it.  She exited her vehicle, and straightened her top, but when she was briskly walking, it fell down, and her right breast was exposed to the public.  I know the guys who were standing outside near her were excited in more ways than one! ;-)

She's a natural redhead, and man, I love most redheads... she looks absolutely beautiful.  It is a fact that all natural-born redheads have pink nipples.  lol  I wonder if it holds true for Lindsey. =)

On a side note - I need to start dating.  Really bad.  I want to go hit the clubs and meet people.  I can't this 3-day weekend though, because I am very short on money.  *sigh*

This July 21-25, I will be going to stay with my father in Cape Coral, Florida.  While there, I plan on going to some clubs and meeting people, and dancing with strange women.  It will be fun... I <B><I>REALLY</B></I> can't wait!

Maybe I'll get to meet someone who resembles Lindsey Lohan. =)"

<P class=c2><A name=107724596135636238>allright... here we go. Just before Christmas, I moved out of the house, because mom's (soon to be ex) husband went psycho and threatened to slice my throat open while i was sleeping or something like that, so I didn't want to put up with the B.S. anymore. I asked my friend Patric to do me a huge favor... I didn't even mention wanting to move in with him, but as soon as he said something, his mom heard in the background or something like that, and said that I could bring all of my stuff over right then and there. Luckily, Patric and his girlfriend Suzy were in town, and within a matter of minutes, they pulled up into my old driveway with both of their vehicles, and we started moving my room. I took all of my valuables, and by the end of the day, I was moved out. I stayed in Patric's basement, and it was great. within only a few feet of my bed, there was a shower/bathtub, along with a toilet. In the other room there was a refrigerator and deep freeze as well. Anyhow, I lived there for about 2.5 months, and finally, now, I am living in some apartments in the city limits of Haleyville. I only have to drive 1.4 miles to work every morning, so I can sleep in later. My job has been going great; I have been given so much responsibility. My column is going great as well. It's always fun and interesting to share my thoughts with all of our readers. Mom is going to court on Monday, so hopefully by monday afternoon when I get off, she'll be divorced. My cousin Janie is over... she's cool, but man, I'm tired of listening to talking. My head is killing me. I'm going to stop for now.<BR><BR>Suzy (Patric's girlfriend) was promoted today, as far as I know, to a full-bred DJ at the Z (100.5 FM in Tuscaloosa, AL) (http://www.z1005.com/) anyhow, she does the Best of Beaner and Ken show on Saturday mornings. It's great. I am so very proud of her. Tomorrow, she and Patric will be coming to town for the weekend. I'm looking forward to it. For now, I'm going to go.

<P class=c2><A name=107766960050720682>I posted a long post before about me moving into a new apartment in the PJ's. I'm livin in a cardboard condo. anyhow, mom's husband is still psycho, and her divorce can't get here soon enough. I can't wait to be rid of him from my life. On a brighter side, I found an old blog of mine where I mentioned me being on hotornot.com... visit this link to vote on me. I was an 8.3 a while ago, so that means that I'm kinda hot, but not completely totally hot. hehe http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=NMSEOSB&amp;key=DGD just copy and paste into your browser.

<P class=c2><A name=107809845150598585>It's time.<BR>-----------<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>anyhow, I digress, let's get down to business.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I have been doing some thinking of late, and let me just say this now, this is an idea <BR>generating session, not something that will go into immediate effect...<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I have decided that, this summer, when things simmer down, and I don't have so much to do at my job, I will return to the world of RotS.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>wow both you and zorlan<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>Not as a player, mind you, but as an Area God.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I want to claim a portion of the map to call my own, and build out my ideas and vision...<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>Before I left, I severely wanted to work on the west<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>mainly the southwest.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>Seed is east god<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>Felagund is west god<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Be back in 5/10<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I wanted to develop our map that we have now to the SW, first making the pass of Caradhras, then, the other side of the mountains, into the gates of Moria.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I bet I could talk Felagund into giving me a section of the SW. <BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I plan on ultimately reaching the gates of Moria, and then, creating Moria itself.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>Seed runs it<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>it is a HUGE undertaking, but it will take a major combined effort.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>and Seed will not give it up<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Seed might not have a choice.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>Seed is East god, is she not?<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>Moria is in the west.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>correct<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>yes<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>but dont you want to start in the sw and build w?<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>yeah... start in the existing part of our map in the mountains in the SW, and extend that farther West and Southwest, mainly<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>not extending it north, but southwesterly<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>because I want to make Moria... let me share this with you... I've already told Dave.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>we are near to getting goblin gates<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>good, good, but that's in the north, isn't it?<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>northwest Misties?<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>you'd know better than i<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>not sure where it is<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I think the last time I heard anything, it was going to be in the Northwest<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>but at any rate, my area would go along with that concept<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>Gimli's folk repopulated Moria after the war of the ring, correct.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>but it isn't all that impossible that orcs still managed to maintain a hold on the lower regions of Moria<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>yes yes<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and the dwarves mainly stay in the upper levels, save a few dwarvish miners who like to delve into the earth...<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>anyhow<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>The way I would like to see it<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>and you want to recruit me to help you build<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>is that the dwarves who remain in moria, have build a staircase near the ruins of the bridge of khazad-dum<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and the staircase goes all the way down the pit into the underground lake<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>I actually recommended you Brett.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>players can go all the way down there and fight lots of tough mobs int he waters and darkness...<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and the best thing is<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I plan to construct the endless stair<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>how<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>that leads up the mountain to the peak where Gandalf fought the Balrog<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and the ruins of that battle still exist<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>About 100 rooms of the stair.<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>90 of them being identical. <BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>it will be a lot of rooms, more than 100 or so<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>how many zones will you need?<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>exactly... very identical to the ones before them, so you can get easily lost<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>Let me think about that and i'll tell you in a minute<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>anyhow<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>once you start nearing the top, the rooms change descriptions<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>but all the way from the bottom of the lake to the last step, orcs and goblins run rampant through the staircase<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and I'm thinking that once you reach the top, you get one room that surveys the damage caused by the legendary fight of Gandalf vs. the balrog<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>then if you go into another neighboring room, you get ambushed by a smob that hunts you and chases you down the stairs<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>it'll be jolly good fun<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Hrmm...<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Just curious.<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>What kind of smob?<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>you can lead the smob all the way back to the bottom, but it won't follow you back up to the bridge ruins<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Like, race? <BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>that can be discussed later<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>something incredible though, and plausible<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>It'd be cool if it was a goblin/orc hunter/<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>not a balrog though<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>how much do you know of the dark rider and the hunter?<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>more than likely an orc, uruk, or some kind of jacked up mountain troll<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I dont' know anything about the game in the past 2 years, nearly. but these are plans that I would like to develop<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>anyhow<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>the trip would be a great one for 30+ characters to rack up nice exp<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and mounts are not allowed in Moria, because ""the mines are no place for a pony.""<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>so, you have to have travelling, big time<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>i wasnt talking about in game<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>they arent in the game yet<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>good, because the Nazgul shouldn't exist anymore... lol<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>anyhow<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>this summer, not much tends to happen<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>so I won't be busy being a reporter, so I'll have plenty of nights off<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>you are my savior<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>I thought you'd ike the idea of this. <BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>hopefully i will be on high enough of a level to work with you<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I will need several project managers.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>hah<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Sorry, my keyboard is busted. &gt;.&lt;<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>like, at least three<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>hah<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and they can choose their builders<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Not many active immortals left.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>hah<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>well<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>hmm, maybe we can just recruit some, and make some.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>it's a huge undertaking, if you understand<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>because we'll have to make Moria believable<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>it will have to be at least a five-day trip to the other side, where the bridge is<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>or, we can use a script<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>like, if you ask around about it enough<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>you know how to script?<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>yeah<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I've made a few quests involving scripts in the past<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I'd just have to brush up again<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>let me list you the immortal staff<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>Felagund Seed Elagor Rochallor Pix Alduris Thalgor Valis<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>anyhow, a dwarvish convoy escorts you through the halls, and to the ruins of Khazad-Dum, and the newly constructed downward stair<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and we can mention in the script that several days go by as you travel or something<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>you know, that way, we won't have to build as many rooms to get to the stair.<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>and it makes you hungry and thirsty<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>yeah<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>something like<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>We could figure out something like that<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>but still, the main area where the dwarves live in Moria would have to be grand, and big<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>The halls seems endless as your feet tired and your stomach rumbles.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>at least the size of the elven halls<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>finally something fun to build<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Elven halls are small.<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>It would need to be grand.<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>And very statuesque.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>well, I couldn't think of anything big<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>lol<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>the size of Laketown and the Halls combined<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>is how big the city of Dwarrowdelf would be<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>the size of Thorgor's Castle<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>then to go on the quest, it could use some of the ferry scripts to make time pass by<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>you know, and make it seem like it takes a while to go<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>you can get backstory during that part, you know<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>but I can come up with that later<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>then the stair/underground would be one zone in itself<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and the endless stair/top of the mountain would be one more seperate zone<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>would the stairs all be like this<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>The Endless Stairs N S<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>kind of<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>Well...<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>i want them to get lost<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>I'm thinking more of...<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>u s u s u s u s u s<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>etc.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>it would be kind of like that, yeah<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>u u u u n n u n u n u n u n u nu n u n u n u n u n u

u<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and would have a lengthy, but uniform description, except for the rooms where the <BR>places change directions.<BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>so, it is very feasible.<BR><BR>Joe

says:<BR><BR>Or rest a lot.<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I think that this summer, it can begin.<BR><BR>Dave says:<BR><BR>And get killed by mobs. <BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>or both. <BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>cackle<BR><BR>Brett says:<BR><BR>he has 30k<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>I believe that I can round up some of my old team<BR><BR>Joe says:<BR><BR>and convince them to build with me again.

<P class=c2><A name=108580888048998945>I can say with all honesty that my current favorite TV show, Teen Titans, is having a run for its money for the top slot... I love Teen Titans... it's friggin great... however... I have to argue that there is another show that is playing and slowly stealing my interest away, big time...<BR><BR>It only comes on Friday nights, at 11 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., right before Saturday morning... and it's on MTV2... a while back, I was channel surfing late at night, and I ended up landing on MTV2 right at about 10 p.m. One of my old favorite shows was on, Aeon Flux... very cool show... very freaky, but such is the way of the animator of Reign: The Conqueror.<BR><BR>I watched both episodes of Aeon Flux, (10 and 10:30 p.m.) and afterward, my mind was completely blown away.<BR><BR>The screen turns black, and there is some techno-like trance music playing... then he appears.<BR><BR>My FAVORITE comic book hero of ALL TIME: Spider-Man.<BR><BR>There is a friggin computer-animated Spider-Man series that plays on MTV2... it is GREAT!!!!!! I wonder if it is available on DVD.... if a collection is available, I will definitely buy it. These shows are just so amazing. They're interesting, hip, and are based off of the films... though the voice actors aren't the same, it doesn't matter, because the flavor is very much the same, if not better...<BR><BR>The love story between Peter and M.J. continues to develop, and M.J. and Spidey share a numerous amount of lip-locking together... however, a third wheel is thrown in, as Peter meets Indie, a hip tv news reporter (newspaper reporters are better =) ) and kind of falls for her as well... though his feelings for Indie aren't nearly the way that they are about M.J. I mean jeeze, c'mon, it's about Mary Jane, portrayed by actress Kirsten Dunst (God I love her... so beautiful and elegant, not to mention smart...) The last episode I watched had Spider-Man getting controlled by these twins with mind-controlling powers... and he was led to believe that he ended up killing M.J.... as a matter of fact, the twins made him have a dream about his worst fear... losing Mary Jane Watson... in the dream, Spidey saves her from sudden-terror, like always... and afterwards, she says something like, ""Ever gotten the feeling that you've had to choose between two people, but wished that they were one person the whole time?"" and then Spidey says, ""Maybe it is time that you should know..."" and then he slowly lifts up his mask, up to his bottom lips.... then it shows M.J. gasp... then it cuts back to Spidey, and he lifts his mask up completely... M.J. is completely speechless, but is incredibly happy, because it's her dreams come true... her two loves are actually the same person.... but then she ends up getting killed by a poison dart filled with spider venom... from some hunter guy that escaped from a Ukranian prison.... and then she dies in the unmasked Spider-Man's hands... and she says, ""Peter.... I am so.... happy...."" then she dies.... it cuts to a scene of Peter mourning at her grave, which reads, ""Mary Jane Watson - 1984 - 2003."" Making her MY age (wink, wink) Then while still in his dream, the twins convince him that all of the stuff in his dream actually did happen, and then he wakes up, still believing that it happened... then he went out for revenge against someone... and I don't know what the hell is going to happen next, but it's very very suspenseful and exciting..<BR><BR>That's the only bad thing about the show... it only airs two times every Friday. So I have to wait another week until I can watch it again. I didn't get to watch it last week because I went up to Florence to spend some time with Derick, and hopefully meet someone... I really need to date someone. I'm handsome, funny, charming, full of wit, and I am the last of the dying breed of true gentlemen... if you're interested, send me an e-mail. =) (Like anyone is going to read this anyhow)<BR><BR>I digress, but oh well, that's what this place is all about. Thanks for reading! =) If I could, I would get a live journal so that people could post responses to all of my blabberings on... I guess I'm too cheap to do that though. =)<BR><BR>So, to sum it all up, watch Spider-Man next Friday, and every Friday, and if you know if the series is available on DVD, TELL ME! =)<BR><BR>Good night friends.</A> <BR><SMALL>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2004_05_23_incanus_archive.html#108580888048998945""><FONT color=#c0c0c0>5/29/2004 12:14:40 AM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=95794097>This morning I went in at 9AM at the newspaper, and had a meeting with Mr. Mann, and was informed that out of several people who applied for the position, I was the one who got it!!!! I'll be making like, $325 a week at first. It's so great! I am sooooooooooooo happy!!!!!!! I cannot believe the fortune that has befallen me! Fate has waved its hand in a most excellent turn!!!!!! The most memorable thing is that I met Mr. Chad Fell, (The senior reporter with whom I will be working) And Mr. Jimmy Mayhall... My desk is in the same room as those two guys! I've got my own desk, my own macintosh computer... and it's all just great! I'm listening to ""Across the Stars"" right now from The Attack of the Clones soundtrack... I love this song! It's what's been going on in my head over and over all morning long! Tomorrow I have to give my two weeks' notice to Wal-Mart to let them know that I am moving on... I'll miss my 10% discount there... but heck, i'm making at least 50% more than I was making there! Wal-Mart is a great place to work, i'll grant that, but we'll see if I like working at the paper even more! I think I'm going to buy a Mac so that I can get used to using one... I haven't used a mac before in so long, it's kind of hard to remember what the last program i ran on one was... :) Surely if these 40+ year old people can use Macintosh's... I can! Hehehe... well, That's about all for now... time to relax on my day off! :D</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_06_15_incanus_archive.html#95794097""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>6/18/2003 10:42:56 AM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=95726982>This morning I got a call from the newspaper... I have an appointment Wednesday at 9AM... I hope to God that I got this job!!!! To be free of the drudgery of being everyone's slave at Wal-Mart, and pushing carts and stocking bleach and water, and sweeping softlines, and collecting and disposing of trash, hanging up bikes, putting up and picking up layaways, climbing those stairs up and down, all day long...... to be free of that and to actually make more than $11,682.00 a year would be absolutely marvelous!!!!!!!!!!!! To have a salaried, full-time job with insurance benefits and other benefits would just totally kick butt!!!! I hope and pray that I get this job..... I need to get in touch with my english teacher, Mrs. Williams, so I can borrow some of my best essays from her for the guys at the paper to read, to see how great of a composer I am! :D Hopefully I can get in touch with Mrs. Williams soon, somehow!!!!<BR>*prays to God that he gets this job!!!!!*</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_06_15_incanus_archive.html#95726982""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>6/16/2003 02:33:33 PM</FONT></A></SMALL>&nbsp;<BR><BR><STRONG> </STRONG></P>

<P class=c2><A name=106427143244385198>Again, it's been a while. This morning, at approximately 8:05 a.m., I was sitting on the Highway waiting to turn into my workplace's driveway, when all of the sudden, BLAM!!! the back of my car gets smashed into by a girl I used to know in High School. She is pretty hot. I pulled out of the highway and into my workplace, got out in the pouring rain, got soaked, and walked over to her door.<BR>I asked her if she was okay, and she was. She asked the same, and I was completely fine. The rear of my car got scratched on the bumper, and the sides of the bumper were disconnected from the sides of my car... it's still hanging on there though.<BR>The front of her car was pretty much smashed in. It was her fault, she said that she wasn't paying any attention. So, her insurance company is going to buy me a new bumper, and provide me with a rental car so I can work. I'm looking forward to the rental car. :-D<BR>She is a very beautiful girl, if I didn't mention this before. I think later I'm going to ask her if I can take her to dinner for repayment of her insurance going up massively and paying for all of my damages. Hopefully I can get a date! :D<BR>I've seen a few good movies that started with a male and a female in a wreck, then they fall for each other. Hopefully this will happen to me. I'm lonely, and I have money, so ladies, if you're hot, and you're my type, and are interesting, and you would like someone to treat you like the woman you are, look me up. ;-)</A> <BR><SMALL>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_09_21_incanus_archive.html#106427143244385198""><FONT color=#c0c0c0>9/22/2003 05:57:12 PM</FONT></A><BR><BR><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>

<P class=c2><A name=106619104383087076>Well, tonight, after a three-month silence, Amanda decided to email me. She said that she wanted me to be a part of her life. The highlight of the night was this quote from her:<BR>
<P><I><FONT color=#999999 size=5>""I'm sorry for being a bitch to you.""</I>
<P></FONT><BR>Yeah, that pretty much made my night. </P>
<P><BR><BR>On another note, the other day I was hit on by a 22-year old and also, today, I received my <A href=""http://www.lordoftherings.net/"" target=lotrwindow><FONT color=#c1d5ff>One Ring</FONT></A> from Ebay.

<P class=c2><A name=106678859842682421><A href=""http://members.tripod.com/jorellano/""><FONT color=#c0c0c0>Pictures by Joseph Orellano</FONT></A> -- I have to add that this is the site that I upload most of the interesting pictures I take to... check it out sometime.<BR><BR>
<P>On another note, I've been meaning to talk about the recent things that have happened. 
<P><BR><BR>Firstly... you may have read about <I>The Bama Incidents</I>... hehe, these are actually quite funny. Amanda McGue, this chick that I know from my junior and senior prom, works at the Bama Drive In, a local restaurant. It's drive-in fast food at its finest. (I really suggest trying a Bama Delight. (kind of like a milkshake with goodies in it)... anyhow, the girls that work with Amanda think that she is flirting with me, but in reality, Amanda revealed to me that she doesn't date anyone, because she believes that God will send the person He wants her to marry when the time is right.... the thing is, how will she know when the time is right <B>unless she dates people to find out what they're like!</B> 
<P><BR>That over, the girls that she works with make fun at her all of the time when I drive up. Recently, I found out that when they see me drive up, they start singing and dancing and shouting that ""Joe is here! Joe is here!""... Some of the songs that they sing are quite hillarious. My favorite (that they have performed for Amanda and I many times when Amanda comes to bring me my order) is the <I>Tree Song</I>... It basically goes as follows:<BR><I><BR>Amanda and Joe, sitting in a tree, F-U-C-K-I-N-G</I> 
<P><BR><BR>They repeat this as many times as is necessary... I have heard from sources that the song continues long after I have driven away. When I am not there, or at least after I have been there, I am the topic of discussion for the remainder of the night. These girls tease Amanda about our wedding, and that we should date.<BR><BR>
<P><BR><BR>I have to agree, I would date Amanda. She is a fine young woman. She is only 16, but she is incredibly intelligent and beautiful: both things that I look for in a woman. 
<P><BR><BR>The only thing that I don't really think I would like over time is the fact that she is incredibly head-over-heels religious. She is so into her Christianity that she doesn't date people. I think this is fine and dandy, and is a great thing. I wish I could feel that strongly about my religion. 
<P><BR><BR>The thing is, though, that I pretty much don't go to church. I just can't get into it like everyone else around here. I live in the South, and almost everyone goes to church, and is adamant that I should attend as well... I've been to a few churches in the community, and I don't like any of them. The preachers yell way too loud, for way too long, or, they sing way too much, or, they just make me feel uncomfortable. I'll worship God and Jesus just fine from the comfort of my own home or wherever I find myself and feel like saying Thanks. 
<P><BR><BR>Now, there are MANY, <B>MANY INSTANCES</B> of the girls at the Bama poking fun at Amanda and I.... truthfully, there is one girl who works at the Bama who I find myself quite attracted to besides Amanda.... her name is Amber.... I dated an Amber once, and she caused me much displeasure that I will not force myself to remember... I'd like to date this Amber, though. :D 
<P><BR><BR>Now onto much more recent events: This past weekend was the gaming event of the season: RedNecronomiCon. I have pictures of the badge I received uploaded to my <A href=""http://members.tripod.com/jorellano/"" target=joespicturesitewindow><FONT color=#c0c0c0>picture site</FONT></A>. Check them out. I played a mixed game of <I>Call of Cthulhu</I> and <I>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</I>. My character's name was Balkazaar. He was a fighter. I don't recall his stats atm, but he did have a <B>friggin awesome</B> flaming scimitar that killed several guardsmen, a dire lion (solo at that), a massive spider that was guarding a chest of gold and silver that he took, and also, of course, Yara, the Wizard of the tower. The place we raided was <I>The Tower of the Elephant</I>... we stole the Heart of the Elephant. We, includes me, my associate editor at the newspaper, and one of her friends' friends from Birmingham, Bruce. Bruce was a cool guy... he was our priest. Dawn was our rogue/thief. It was very fun. In fact, I'm going to be gaming from now on. It's much more fun than playing RotS, in my opinion, because, well, your fingers don't tire-out. hehe<BR>
<P><BR>Hopefully this post isn't too long, and if any of the guys from the group are reading this... don't think I'm too strange if you decide to go through the archives of the posts I've made on here... I speak my mind, and I care not what others think of me. :D<BR><BR>
<P><BR>With that said, adieu.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=2>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_10_19_incanus_archive.html#106678859842682421""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=2>10/21/2003 09:09:58 PM</FONT></A><BR><BR><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>

<P class=c2><A name=106833234739869333>****<B>NOTE, RETURN OF THE KING VIDEO GAME SPOILERS IN THIS POST!!!</B>**** 
<P><BR><BR><BR>Well, Nov. 6, I went to Wal-Mart during my lunch break, and they had a copy of The Return of the King for PS2. I bought it first thing, took it home after work, started playing it, and was in tears. The character detail, background detail, ambience; everything about it is incredibly moving and amazing. And what I think is really great, is that Sauruman's voice is actually Chrisopher Lee's in this game... in the Two Towers for PS2, his voice was someone else's, and it kind of took away from the quality of it. I beat the game regularly, and now, I'm stuck on the two special stages, The Palantir of Sauruman and the Palantir of Sauron. Sauron's Palantir is incredibly hard, and I keep getting killed on the 17th level of Sauruman's Palantir. If you played the last game, these two stages are similar to the Tower of Orthanc. You have to kill so many different enemies throughout the level, and then once you've killed all of them, you advance to the next level; there are 20 levels in all. Once you beat the Tower in the last game, you confronted Sauruman, who told you that you were a fool, and then he vanished mysteriously. You also got to unlock the hidden character, Isildur, who you could play the entire game with. His fighting style is very similar to Aragorn's (it makes sense), and I think even Aragorn's voice is what is used sometimes. lol The extra characters in ROTK are Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Faramir. I've just been kicking butt with Aragorn and Gandalf the White. When I finally beat the Palantiri, I will let you know what happens.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=2>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_11_02_incanus_archive.html#106833234739869333""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=2>11/8/2003 04:59:07 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P><BR><BR><B>I Am A:</B> Chaotic Good Elf Ranger Druid<BR><BR><BR><U>Alignment:</U><BR><B>Chaotic Good</B> characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.<BR><BR><BR><U>Race:</U><BR><B>Elves</B> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed.

I can't go into the details too much, but to make things short: I now have my own column in the newspaper.

It's entitled, ""Hey Joe, What Do You Know?""... catchy, 'ain't it?<BR><BR>My first column was about technology, and my views on it. I don't know what my next one will be about. I think we're going to run my column every wednesday and Dawn's column every Saturday, so it's still really cool.<BR><BR>I'm also getting my raise, finally.

<P class=c2><A name=107177689864228437>Well, this morning was interesting: Firstly, there was a wreck where a woman hit a deer, then later, a guy brought his 13 year old son to the office where he had killed his first deer; then I got a call from the staff of Phillips Elementary School in Bear Creek; they asked me to come by sometime today or tomorrow because they had a surprise for me; so I went by today, and all of the kids had made me Christmas cards that say, ""Thanks Mr. Joe"" and stuff like that, for supporting their school.... they even gave me a fruit basket with tons of fruits and raisins and walnuts and even a pack of big red gum in it. I appreciate them for everything they've done for me, and the cooperation they've given me... they were just glad to have me provide publicity for their school... then I did an interview with the newly elected manager of one of the banks in town, and now, after I get back from my lunch break in about 13 mins, I will have to develop film. It's going to be an interesting day for me this afternoon as I type out the rest of these stories. I like the holidays.

<P class=c2><A name=90615539>I'm hired. :D I'm a ""99"" at first... I have to go back in Friday to finish filling out my paper work, because John Hendrix (I believe that's how his last name was spelled) had to leave, and there was so much chaos going on that they didn't have time enough today to help me fill out my paperwork. :D So anyhow, I've got the job! *DANCES* I am now an employee of the richest department store chain in the world... a 500 Billion Dollar company - Wal-Mart! *breakdances with glee!* I have a feeling that I will love working here. I had to wait on Cathy to interview me.. (I didn't know I would have another interview) but anyhow, I spoke with her and she told me what I expected she would say... she's a big ""stickler"" for punctuality and attendance. She wants me to be at work and do my job. And that's exactly what I plan to do. Everyone says that she's mean and such, but I believe she's a great person. She has to be in order to be the manager. You can't be everyone's friend and be their boss at the same time. It just doesn't work out. But she is friendly enough for me to like her and cooperate with her and the rest of the team. :D Mrs. Tucker (My 9th grade science teacher) works at Wal-Mart in the afternoons, and she was there (in the jewelry department) and she congratulated me.. as wel as Frankie Harrison (or however his last name was spelled)... he's the sporting goods manager. Anyhow, everyone congratulated me, and I also got a great gift from my mom... She got me my own cell phone *dance* I have a 600 minute package with free (basically free, 5,000 minutes per month) on nights (past 9PM) and free weekends.... I want to change my phone number to 3791 instead of what it currently is... you know, the whole Lord of the Rings thing. :D 3 rings to the elven kings, beneath the sky. 7 to the dwarf lords in their halls of stone. 9 to mortal men doomed to die, and one to the dark lord on his dark throne... Anyhow, I'm very happy about that. This way I will be able to stay in touch with people while i'm at work and during my breaks. I'm very very very happy, and all nervousness has left me. I can't wait to begin working with the team and contributing to the whole experience. I want to be one of the best 99's that has ever passed through the store. :D... Friday at 3:30 I fill out my paperwork, and after that, I do not know what lies in store for me....</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_incanus_archive.html#90615539""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>3/12/2003 05:32:43 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=90548294>**On a side note, I don't think I posted this, but Shelly is the Manager in Charge of Hiring, I believe... and John is the Assistant Manager of the Store :D**<BR><BR>Well, I got home about 30 minutes ago from my interview... I spent some time playing with my rabbit so she would be happy. The interview went absolutely great. At first, there is always the strange quality of uncertainty hanging in the air, but with me, that only lasted for about one minute. Afterwards, I felt very comfortable and confident in my answers and what was going on. One of the questions I was asked was something like, ""Has someone ever been untrue to you recently, and if so, how did you deal with it?"" Well, I asked him to rephrase the question, (The Assistant Manager's name was John, he was a very very very very cool guy who is very laid back and friendly)... and he gave me a situation... somewhat loosely like this:<BR><BR>Say Shelly here told you she was in the movie ""My Dog Skip... how would you deal with that?"" So I started by saying ""Well, first, I would check the credits of the aforementioned movie, and be sure if Shelly was actually in the credits. In this case, obviously she isn't, because she lied to me. Then, I would confront the said individual and tell her ""You know I do not appreciate you lying to me about you being in the movie. I have checked the credits, and you are nowhere in them. This hurts me, quite frankly!"""" and then all through my response, John started busting up laughing really hard for some reason, and Shelly laughed so hard that she had to leave the room, completely red in the face... John was laughing so hard that he was crying, and I was laughing too. :D That was probably the best part of the whole interview... basically I told them that I was a hard working individual who is committed to the tasks laid before me, I was dedicated, and pleasant and outgoing. I don't remember what else I said, but I do remember that some of my responses were replied by John with a ""Great answer"" ""very good answer"" etc etc... So then I took an opinion survey consisting of about 67 questions, then double checked my answers, turned it in to Shelly, and shook her hand. She told me that tomorrow, I would be given a phone call, because Cathy (The new store manager) would probably like to meet me before I get hired. So I shook her hand and thanked her and told her to have a great day. Then I left the store. :D<BR><BR>So basically, I believe that I am probably going to be hired tomorrow. :D I really really really really hope so! I told her that I had a great time and enjoyed the opportunity. It was a very great time. I want to work at Wal-Mart, because I feel that not only will I get a good job and benefits, but I will have a very good, fun time. Oh, I just remembered one of the questions. ""What do you feel is the most important benefit of a job?"" and I replied simply, ""Insurance."" :D hehe Oh Lord, please help me get this job!!!</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_incanus_archive.html#90548294""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>3/11/2003 04:42:52 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<H4>Sunday, March 09, 2003:</H4></B>
<P class=c2><A name=90403805>I got home this morning at about 2:48 AM. The prom was kind of fun, despite my voice being gone and me coughing constantly (which I am doing right now). Everything was great at the beginning. Amanda and I went over to Scott and Brett Norris's house, and had a ""fancy dinner"". Since there were no really nice gormet restaurants in Haleyville, they put together one in their living room. We had candles and everything. Cornish hen, (ham for me), french onion soup, some kind of really good rice, and for dessert, we had 3 different types of cheese cake. It was all good. Then we left for the prom. I had to do the Havala thing right when I got there, and then afterwards, I had to take a few pictures for Mrs. Adkins and the school... that ticked off Amanda. We had to go get our pictures taken and her feet were killing her because of her shoes... so we went and got our pictures taken. Then we danced to a very small amount of slow songs, and about 4 or 5 fast songs, and took a few breaks. Amanda got ticked off at me because I didn't really feel like dancing all that wildly... if I did, I would have started coughing and would have had to sit out for the rest of it all... We did the Senior Walkout at about oh, 11:30 or so, and then when it came time for ""Senior Joseph Orellano, escorting Amanda Walter"" we walked over the little bridge, and I stopped nearly on the other side, and to lighten things up, I gave a peace sign and smiled. A few people chuckled... it was good. Then we danced to the last dance, and I took a picture with Peter because his mom wanted one, and then we left. We had decided to go to Natural Bridge Restaurant for some breakfast... so we went there, and things were great at first. We ordered our food, and then Amanda had to go to the bathroom. She went in there, and then while she was in there, about 10 or 12 guys and 1 girl came in. They all went everywhere inside the restaurant, and some of them went to the bathrooms... Amanda walked out really fast and told me that some guy had hit on her while she was walking out by saying ""You look <B>nice</B>!"" and giving her a funny look. She told them ""Thank you"" very kindly, and then left... then she told all of us about it, and then Stephanie Hood had to go to the bathroom, so she did, and some other guys said the same thing to her, but they were really close to the door, so she just didn't say anything to them at all and shoved the door open and walked really fast back to the table. Then the other guys all sat down at their little booths behind us. Then it began. They started cussing amongst themselves, and then we heard some comments like ""I would f**k all three of them!"" and by ""all three of them"" they were meaning our dates. (Amanda, Amanda, and Stephanie)... well, we listened some more, and then Brett started telling a joke, and then Scott said out loud ""Yeah, that was real funny."" then one of the guys said ""I bet it was real funny."" And then we all just shut up and Scott looked at them blankly. Then they made a comment out loud like ""I could jab that guy's eye out with a butterknife"" and then the other ones started laughing. I then overheard them saying ""Where are they from"" ""Are they from Lynn?"" ""ask them where they're from"" then someone said ""Where are y'all from?"" and then either Scott or Brett said ""Haleyville"" then one of them said ""We're from Brilliant"" and he just smiled and nodded his head. They started cussing really loudly, and then Brett asked for our waitress to come over there. She came over, and he asked her if she would ask them to lower it down a little bit, because there were ladies present and everything... so the waitress went over, and then it really began. They got into an arguement and started saying bullcrap about us doing something like being stuck up pricks. Then they got insulted by the waitress asking them to keep their cussing down, and argued with her, then she got totally pissed off, and said ""I have teenagers at home who behave better than you!!!"" then she said ""I get paid $3 an hour to put up with sh*t like this, and it isn't enough!!!!"" the argument went on and on, and then she said, ""What's your order?"" then the guys just kept arguing and cussing and getting really worked up and pissed off over nothing. The waitress kept asking them ""What's your order?"" about 5 times, then she said something like ""THEN LEAVE!"" really really loudly, and one of the guys got really ticked off and got up and shoved or threw his chair across the floor. I don't know what it was, because I had my back to them the whole time. I only glanced back at them once, for about half of a second. Then they left, and one of them came back in and Scott said, ""Hey, we're sorry about the misunderstanding. and then that guy said ""There wasn't no f***in' misunderstandin'. We know what it was all about"" then Scott said ""it was a misunderstanding, we didn't..."" then he got interrupted and that guy said ""You all have to leave sometime."" and he repeated that several times. Well, of course we all felt threatened. So we waited, and we looked outside, and they were all standing around 3 pickup trucks. They then moved to the gas station nearby, and hid behind a truck.... so you know, if we were to leave and head towards home, they would have followed us and lots of crap would have happened. Scott and I were working ourselves up that whole time to beat some redneck morons, but we knew that we didn't want to, because 12 Vs. 3 was not very fair at all. I don't care, I felt like kicking some butt anyhow, even though I was sick and tired, and very annoyed at the whole thing. We sat down for about 20 mins, and looked outside occasionally and they were circling the parking lot... so, Amanda (Brett's Date) called her dad and he called the police, and her dad came out there and started walking outside... then eventually the Chief of Police of Natural Bridge or Lynn or some place like that came, and asked us what the problem was. Brett explained to him that they were verbally harassing us and threatening us and verbally sexually harassing the girls. He then told us to sit tight while he went to go round them up... Blue lights flashed, and shortly after, a Sherrif of Winston County came inside with the police Chief, and asked us what all went on, we told him, and he walked off outside to go talk to the guys. The chief asked us if we wanted to press charges if it came down to it, and the girls took forever to come to a decision of ""yes""... Stephanie Hood just repeated the story several times (That got REALLY annoying) and then it got all quiet, and my Amanda asked me if we should, and I just nodded my head yes... then she said ""yes"" and the other girls finally said yes. The Sherrif came and told us that they all left, and if they came back, they wouldn't be going home again. He told us that if they did it again, that they wouldn't come home again. So, eventually, we all left for home, and I got in at 2:48 and tried to go to sleep... now it's 9:57, and I got up about 20 mintues ago, because of my half sister and her stupid friends being loud, and not caring about me only getting 6.5 hours of sleep...... bleh. What a day. I guess I'll never forget my Senior Prom night. :P</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_incanus_archive.html#90403805""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>3/9/2003 10:00:21 AM</FONT></A><BR><BR><STRONG><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P class=c2><A name=92092168>Okay, during the band trip, at the hotel gift shop, I met this guy, who was a 53 year old French Canadian guy. I asked him how he was doing, and how his day had been, and he really appreciated me askin him that. We chatted for a while, and became friends. The next day, my voice was all screwed up from me coughing so hard, and he asked what was wrong with my voice. (he asked me this the night that we got back from the aquarium/fair park) Anyhow, he reached over the counter and gave me a pack of Halls cough drops for free. He told me to suck on them and that my voice should be better. He wouldn't let me pay for them, or the Diet Dr. Pepper that I was trying to buy. He told me that it was on the house, and that I should accept it since I would never see him again. lol... so, I gave up on trying to pay for it all, and I accepted his gift. He even gave Amanda a discount, since she was my girlfriend. It was very cool. The trip sucked overall... the only thing that I liked was Six Flags... I wrote an article for the Newspaper about the trip and everything, it's supposively going to be out this Wednesday in a full-color version... hopefully it will be the front page, because it is a very large story. :) Our band deserves to be recognized on the front page anyhow.</A> <BR><SMALL>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_04_06_incanus_archive.html#92092168""><FONT color=#c0c0c0>4/6/2003 10:35:18 AM</FONT></A><BR><BR><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>

<P class=c2><A name=94830499>Last night was graduation. I got the alumni scholarship. Everyone was there. The gym was packed. The applause and cheering was deafening. I need to get in touch with Mrs. Allen about the paper. I think I want to work there instead of at Wal-Mart. Being a journalist should be cake compared to having to push carts around in the parking lot at work all the time and being everyone's personal monkey butler. It would be great to be a full-time staff writer... this could be a great launch pad for the beginning of my new life. Maybe things will work out for me after all. Thank you God for all of the talents you've given me, and allowed me to bestow upon everyone else and share my gifts through the medium of journalism. Gotta go to Wally World today at 1...... I get off at 10. 40 hrs a week at wal-mart, without the benefits of being a full time employee. That's crap. I need to speak to my managers. If they want to keep me, they'd better come up with a good department position *cough* electronics* cough, or they'd better give me those benefits and possibly another pay raise. lol, either that, or the best 99 they've got is about to jet. :) I'm still weighing out the options. Let's either do this: A: Work at Wal-Mart in the summer, in the 120 degree humidity weather, pushing carts and carrying out heavy air conditioners and whatnot for customers, getting paid below $6 an hour, doing back-breaking work. Or should I B: Work in an air-conditioned office with my own desk, computers, and use the creativity of my brain to simply write stories of events around the place, get paid much more than I get at Wal-Mart, and do work that is easy and fun.... Let's see what happens when I give Mrs. Allen a call. :)</A> <BR><SMALL>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_05_18_incanus_archive.html#94830499""><FONT color=#c0c0c0>5/24/2003 11:11:38 AM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=94766597>Today was graduation practice... 10AM. I went there, and as soon as I walked in, the Editor for the local newspaper asked me if I wanted to be a staff writer for the paper. I told her that I would think about it and get in touch with her. It'll be a full time job, and she's asking me to join without any college experience, fresh out of high school as a full-time staff member. This kicks butt. I just wrote one article for the band and submitted it to the paper, and they want me to write for them. lol English pays off boys and girls, it pays of quite well. :) 
<P>I had my 90 day evaluation the other night at Wally World. I now make $0.22 more than I used to... so now I'm up at $5.62 an hour. Not bad at all. I've made my managers proud of me... so now, I'm torn between working full-time at the paper, and working part-time but getting full-time hours at Wally World, pushing carts, and being everyone's little helper.

<P>I just got home from practice... it's 8:32 PM... mom gave me wonderful news. The doctor called while I was at practice and said that I might have kidney damage... I just hope that it isn't irreversible kidney damage. I don't want to go to the hospital... I don't want to lose my kidneys.... and I definitely don't want to die.... lovely. I suppose all I can do right now is pray, while mom goes and picks up a test kit for me to take for 24 hours straight... then I take the results back to the doctor's office and I find out what is wrong with me.

<P>It seems that everyone is getting a blog nowadays. I am changing the color scheme of this blog so that it can be unique, just like I am. This past week with mom's husband being home has sucked. I had to read some stuff online about <I>Wuthering Heights</I>, and while I was in the process of finishing, mom's husband forced me to get offline so that he could vote on some stupid bullcrap about the Super Bowl while watching it on TV, really loud. The wall between my room and the living room is quite hollow. Any sounds that are made in the living room are reverberated into my room at least twice as loud. It makes reading an impossible task unless the living room is quiet. It has been incredibly cold outside as of late, so reading inside the icy car was not an option. So, I just printed out the 3 pages that I had yet to read, and went to my room, and spent a considerable amount of time reading and trying to understand. Needless to say, today I had to write an Essay on the novel. I really needed to do well on the essay, since I didn't take the novel test, and took a 0 in the grade book. I am really going to have to make up for it the rest of the nine weeks. I have to do a make-up lab project for Chemistry here in a little bit... it involves researching something on the internet. This Thursday, all of the stuff for Havala is due, and I have yet to write my essay on ""What it would mean to me to be Mr. Havala"". I am sure that I could conjure up something good enough to impress the judges. Today, Katie McInnish told me that this past weekend, she was speaking to one of her friends, who told me that every girl in that person's grade believes that <B>I</B> have a <B>sexy</B> voice. I suppose I'm flattered. Brett is talking to me right now, telling me that I had better not write anything slanderous about Katie... hehe, I had to ask him what her last name is, because I could not quite place it. After school she wanted a hug.... and she offered me one of those <I>side hugs</I>... now, I will share with you that I am a firm believer in giving <I>good</I> hugs. I don't like people who give <I>side hugs</I>... if you are going to give a hug...... <I>you had better give a frikkin' <B>great, real</B> hug!</I> My definition of a <I>real</I> hug is using both arms to wrap around the hugee's body, with both persons facing one another directly, not to the side or anything like that. <B>THAT</B>, my friends, is a <B><I>real</B></I> hug. That is one of my pet peeves I suppose. But anyway, last night was fair. I got to go lay down at about 11:00 PM... mom let Buster in again since it was so cold outside. (<I>Buster is our dog.</I>)... and while I was laying down, he came running into my room, and hopped up onto the bed with me, and layed down beside me. He was just happy to be inside in the warmth. He had been given a good bath previous to coming into contact with me, because if he hadn't, then I would not have let him enter my room. Grand Theft Auto 3 is an awesome game, I highly recommend it to everyone. Later, when I find time and am bored to death, I will post how to find the 100 hidden packages throughout the game. It is quite nice to have those weapons and armor load at your hideout :-). Now... to the homework! <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_26_incanus_archive.html/l88119287""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>1/27/2003 04:17:58 PM</U></FONT></A> </P>

<P>Well, Amanda came over today... mom almost had a heart attack when she got back from getting a pizza... scary. Mom was just telling me about when I was 3 years old and we went to Disney Land in California, that on the way out, I saw Dopey, one of the seven dwarfs from Snow White, and he reached out to give me a hug... and I hugged him, and wouldn't let him go... my dad tried to get me away from him, but I just cried and cried and said ""But I love him! i want to take him home with me!"" Lol... how great it must have been to be a child... I really don't remember my childhood years, and I'm 18 now. It's horrible how many memories I've forgotten... and continue to forget with every passing moment. Speaking of my brain... i got this email from the IQ test I took about 2 years ago with my report... I made a <B>148</B>... and the score level was something along the lines of:<BR><BR>100 - average score<BR>120 - ability to pass college and undergraduate classes without difficulty<BR>130 - entry ""genius"" level<BR><B>140 - definite genius level</B><BR>150 - less than 1/2 of 1% of people who take this test get this score or higher....<BR><BR>so, since mine was a <B>148</B>, I made the ""definite genius level""... I'm no genius... that's for sure. Math is something at which I am horrible. :D <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_incanus_archive.html/l88737554""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/7/2003 08:36:21 PM</U></FONT></A> </P>

<P>It's only 11:00 PM, and I'm extremely tired. I asked David Doull, if he could help me out with my game problem, and he seems to be on top of things... I recently asked him if he could help me with a newly arisen problem, and I've receieved no reply yet... hopefully sometime tomorrow he'll have replied to me. I can't check hotmail at school because the school is filled with retarded sys admins who believe that email is bad if it isn't on a school server or some crap like that. Ahh well, no big deal. I just have to sit through 2 and a half hours of stupid retarded freakin band practce immediately after school...... from 3:00 until 5:30. I really really don't give a crap about the band. I could care less if we do bad at district competition this year... I could really give a crap if we go to national competition. We've done it for the past 3 years in a row, and it's just old. And FREAKING <B><U>EXPENSIVE</B></U> It's costing me $196 to go to freakin Dallas, TX for a stupid national band competition that doesn't matter. I am not going to get anything out of it, except for a 3 day vacation with a bunch of band nerds, and my girlfriend. I hate band trips so much. I wish I didn't have to go on them. I wish I would not have joined the band, really...

I hate having to work at home only. I want to be able to work on my game tomorrow during programming, unlike today when I just spent my time trying to get my game to load on the computers.... the firewall, or the stupid CyberPatrol program that is up wouldn't let my preloader work all the way... it would freeze up at 0%, 15% and sometimes 4%...... finally I found a machine that was capable of playing it... and the guys were amazed. :) Enough bickering... going to burn that CD, then pass out... <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_incanus_archive.html/l88514871""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/3/2003 11:07:54 PM</U></FONT></A> </P>

If you ever have problems about not being able to move the ship or fire, be sure to click somewhere on the game itself, so that flash can be the active application you're playing with.. in other words, so flash can ""have the focus""..... okay, go ahead and click on this friggin link!

<P>Well, Happy Valentine's day. I'm sure many peoples' blogs will contain that line today. Last night, I remembered an old episode of The Kids in the Hall, that I aboslutely loved! It was the sketch called ""Love and Sausages"". It featured Bruce McCullah, or however you spell his name... and Scott Thompson, (I think that's his name... It's been a long, long time since I've seen <I>The Kids</I>) and Mark McKenney... Bruce was a guy who worked in a Sausage factory, and smuggled boxes of sausages out of the plant to live on for his deranged father, who is played by Scott, who is obsessed over sausages. Basically, his day consists of waiting for Bruce to get home and make him sausages. His vocabulary basically consists of the word ""Sausages."" It is extremely funny. You can find it on Kazaa... just do a search under video for ""Kids in the Hall - Love and Sausages"". It's one of my favorite skits by them. They're so absolutely funny. Well, mom is sick today. This probably means that she won't take me to go get Amanda. This means that Amanda will be thoroughly ticked off at me for not getting to spend Valentine's Day with her. Maybe mom will feel better after she takes this nap. Hmm... I'm kind of hungry for some...... sausages.... ;) <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_09_incanus_archive.html/l89098375""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/14/2003 10:39:48 AM</U></FONT></A> </P>

<P>Today was district contest for band. I totally messed up when I played my hard 16th note part in <I>The Purple Pagaent</I>... Mr. Williams isn't letting me live this one down. However, the other 2 pieces made up for the suckiness of the first. <I>The Ride of the Valkeryies</I> or however it is spelled, was pretty great, and <I>Finale, from The New World Symphony</I> was pretty dang great. I made up for what I lacked at the beginning of the performance. Anyhow, after the contest, we found out our scores... all <B><I>I</B></I>'s. We celebrated at Chuck E. Cheese's... and we were given a speech that was totally unnecessary. The lady said that the place was usually unaccustomed to people our age-level visiting, but they cater to anyone's needs... so we stayed there. I had 3 slices of pizza, a drink, and I got a free cup of tokens. woo hoo. You know what that means... skee ball time! I spent all of my tokens playing skee ball, and managed to get in the 100,000 point hole several times. I gave all 104 of my tickets away, since I never save them. This is my last year to ever go to Chuck E. Cheese's, being in the band. Wooooo hoooooo! It's usually complete torture for me... the little children being loud... the sound of the other people in the band being too loud... it was okay this time... however, my skee ball games went by fairly slow, because the machine only gave me 1 ball to throw at a time. Oh well, I made due with it. Anyhow, right now, I'd like to give a hello to all of my Model Senate friends who read this... thanks for paying attention to the events in my life. If you are from Homewood, and you happen to know David Catt, let him know that I'm going to email him sometime and try to get a hold of him... tell him I said ""Yo."" hehe Now, since you're bored reading this, why don't you go and play my game. It has been updated. The enemies no longer fire after you kill them, and there are improved graphics and more levels. The file download isn't that bad... there's a preloader that lets you know how much % you have downloaded... so you can do something else while you wait for the game to finish loading. Just click on the ""START"" button on the main screen in front of my face if you want to play. :&gt; The music and sound FX are great. :) I think you should definitely play the game to listen to that, if not for the reason that it's a game that <B><U>I created</B></U>... with the help of some advice from people found in the credits. Oh, and as for the credits, please pay special attention to them... I mean every word. *LOL* The music at the end part of the credits is absolutely wonderful.... listen to it <B>LOUDLY</B>. The game isn't over until the ""Restart"" button appears at the very end. You can click on it, and listen to R2-D2 beep and whistle happily for your choice to replay my game. <A href=""http://www.angelfire.com/film/hadhafang/spacegame.html""><U><FONT color=#00ffff>Click here to play the game!!!</U></FONT></A>... Last night, Derick Thomas came over before he took me to Senior Play practice, and I let him play the game, and he beat it... then he wanted to play it again because he became addicted to it. :D hehe. IT will have many more levels, believe me... and some time, when I can get around to it, it will also have bosses at the end of the levels that you have to defeat. I may even be able to figure out how to code power-ups and such sometime. :D hehe, anyhow, as soon as I can fix a few minor bugs, I'll submit mine to <A href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>The Portal</U></FONT></A> at Newgrounds.com... I have like, 2 other flash submissions there from the past, but they're crap compared to my game. :D hehe Okay, I've preached enough, I'm out of here. Oh, and by the way, I rule. <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_09_incanus_archive.html/l89056539""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/13/2003 04:45:21 PM</U></FONT></A> </P>

<P>well, it's Sunday morning, 9:34 AM according to this computer's clock. Patric came over yesterday and filled out his FAFSA... i need to do that sometime. I've decided that I'm going to go to college in the spring... so that's cool. Last night I got to chapter 5 of <I>Lord of the Flies</I>, and I'm going to finish the rest of the book this afternoon. I have a novel test on it in AP English tomorrow. :) Well, the President says that we're supposed to be expecting an attack on the Eastern Coast sometime this month at the end of an Islamic or whatever holiday... mom said that she read something about ""Bible Codes"" that predicted stuff would happen, and it says next that there will be an attack on the White House.. so until there's an attack on the White House, I won't believe it... it's just a big conspiracy. Just like the Wingdings font... there was something like if you typed out the flight number of one of the airplanes that hit the Twin Towers, it would have wingdings pictures of an airplane hitting the towers with a bomb and a skull.... it was just a big coincidence again. Oh well, I'm going to screw around on the net for a while until mom's husband wakes up, then I'm going to go to my room and finish that novel. <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_09_incanus_archive.html/l88800752""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/9/2003 09:40:08 AM</U></FONT></A> <BR><BR></P><B>

<P>Everyone thinks that Michael Jackson is a freak for caring for kids and having sleepovers, even though he is 44 years old. The interviews and stuff are on TV right now. He's crying. People are such pompous ignorant morons. I can be one of these myself. Everyone is. At some point and time, every day, people are ignorant. I am sometimes. Prejudice people are the most ignorant. People who judge other people based on their skin color, beliefs, or actions, are morons. People that judge other people on past events, such as the civil war and slavery and all of that bull crap, yeah, they're ignorant too. My mother is ignorant. She just said ""He's a psycho."" Just because people cannot open up their mind and think differently... *sigh*. If people would take the time to think of how Michael feels about children... about his bad past as a kid... you can understand why he feels so strongly about love. Even if it's a stranger. Someone he doesn't even know.. letting them sleep in his bed while he sleeps in a sleeping bag on the floor... people thing that is so wrong. I agree with him. All we need is love. All the world needs is love. He's just giving kids what he didn't get as a child. That is his way for redemption. At least he isn't on drugs and crap. He may have or may not have molested a child. I don't know. No one knows but him, the child, and God. People should not judge, lest be judged themselves. In the Bible, it says not to hate. Well, I can say this. I don't hate anyone or anything. I do this because I don't want to go to Hell. I believe that Jesus Christ is my personal Savior... that he died for my sins, as well as everyone else's sins... Anyhow, you see, I do not hate. I have something called ""Extreme Dislike""... it's so much dislike that it borders on hatred... but is not hatred. I love everyone and everything like I am supposed to. But I do dislike......... I extremely dislike people who are prejudice against other people. I extremely dislike racists... those are the ones who tick me off the most. On a somewhat related note.... if I have said anything about you, the reader, directly in one of my posts in the past, I apologize. Anyhow... back to my point. You should not be a racist. You should not be prejudice. You need to open your eyes. Your eyes are the windows to your soul. Unless your soul is tainted and evil... then you should not be prejudice. even if you are evil, you don't need to be prejudice. Like Michael Jackson said... the world needs love. God bless him. God bless everyone. Spread love. Open up your mind... open up your heart... open up your soul. Take in the world around you. Disregard the evils and troubles. Smile. Be happy. Breathe the air. Enjoy the fact that you are alive, and that you were created. Don' t be ignorant. Ignorance may be ""bliss"" sometimes... but to be completely ignorant.... is simply to be a <B>moron</B>. <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_incanus_archive.html/l89282981""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/17/2003 10:13:14 PM</U></FONT></A> </P>

<P>Well, Day two is almost over! We performed for the high school and jr. high school today, and the last performance (The Junior High Performance) was the best. The people on stage got cracked up, and the people in the audience did the same. I took my camera with me, and took tons of <B>AWESOME BLACKMAIL PICTURES</B> of some girls <FONT size=1>in the dressing room</FONT> and some pictures of people on stage... too bad my friggin camera had to fall out of my pocket and burst open and make the batteries fly out... every single picture I took got erased. For the 2nd performance, I tried to take more pictures, and I just got home early, for my break in between the final performance tonight at 7 to download the pictures to my computer, and THEY GOT ERASED TOO... I don't know what the deal is... but it's getting annoying. Maybe I'll be able to catch more of the hijinks while we're getting ready for the last performance tonight. Matt Rhodes and I will probably go in the dressing room and sit on the couch and talk like we did the last time. It was fun. Anyhow, Derick isn't going to be there, so I have double duty on the microphones. It'll be fun though. :D Maybe, just hopefully maybe I'll be able to fix the picture problem. :P When I do, I'll upload them to the net and give an address so you can view them for yourself :D <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_23_incanus_archive.html/l89921323""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/28/2003 03:12:16 PM</U></FONT></A> </P>

<P>Day 1 of the Senior play went by <B>GREAT</B> We all sang really well, and the people did their acting great. Before the play, I stood in the right hallway and gave stickers to the little kids as they walked by and spouted out catch phrases from the time. What I mostly said was ""Don't trust anyone over thirty"" and ""peace"". At the end of the play, I hopped onto the stage, and sang <I>Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog</I> really loudly. it was great... then, I hopped up onto the stage, stood up, and bowed a few times... held up two peace signs high in the air and fell backwards... Matt Rhodes caught me and it was fun... I then told everyone that was leaving peace and hoping them that they had a good time. Today, I asked Kelly Johnson to <I>do me</I> and she said ""You want me to do you, eh? :)""... it was great. She said that she was doing me.... lol.. by that, I meant that she was the one who put on my makeup. Lauren Bishop put on my eyeshadow for me. After the play, I went around hugging all the girls on stage and telling them that they did a great job. Deonna Dodd was <B>ABSOLUTELY HOT</B> I think I peed my pants when she sang Proud Mary in front of me... Will looked like he peed his pants too. She's very very beautiful. It was great. :D Anyhow, I walked into the band room halfway through seventh period and Mr. Williams laughed at me all dressed up and whatnot, along with the rest of the band.... I then had to play my friggin instrument for the rest of the period. Tomorrow, if we get out of the play before 7th period is over, I'm <B>NOT</B> going to the band room. My face still has makeup on it, and I'm going to go remove it all once I finish eating. I'm starving! Maybe sometime I'll be able to get some pictures for posting. It'll be absolutely great. :D <BR>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_02_23_incanus_archive.html/l89861757""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>2/27/2003 03:50:29 PM</U></FONT></A> </P>

<P>Well, it's been a while. Yesterday was absolutely deplorable. First of all, I had had Senior Play practice the night before last, and I was very tired. Then yesterday morning I had to wake up at 6:00 AM instead of my normal 6:45 AM. I did this so that I could attend an appeal trial for that guy who supposively killed a woman and her 7 year old daughter and 4 year old son in Hamilton, AL. After we drove for nearly 2 hours to Hanceville to Wallace State Community College, where the trial took place, we left during the recess to eat lunch at Ryan's. I had a very good meal, with a bowl of ice cream... I have an art when it comes to making a decent bowl of ice cream. First you start with the bottom filled with vanilla-chocolate swirl... then you cover that with a layer of oreo cookie crumbs and chocolate pieces... they look like miniature hershey kisses... anyhow, then you add on your top layer of ice cream (I think I used chocolate) then you add sprinkles ontop of that.... then you eat it. It tasted great. We seemed to have a shorter trip coming home than going up there, probably because we took the fast way home. Anyhow, I was very tired, and my butt was sore, and it was very cold on the bus. Unfortunately, I made it back in time for the very beginning of 7th period band... we had to go to band and play after all. I was looking forward to not having to go to band. *sigh*. I think I hear mom's husband outside... I suppose it wasn't him. Anyhow, to top it all, we had band practice, and senior play practice dress rehearsal started at 4:00PM.... Mr. Williams would not let us leave until 5:00 PM when band practice was over. That pissed me off thoroughly. I can say piss because Amanda's mom said it, according to Amanda. :) So if Amanda's mom can say piss, I can say piss. :D Anyhow, we had to sit through a horrrrrrible band practice for 3 hours. Right after that, I had to get into my hippie costume, (Home made bell-bottoms, {Yes, I made them} home made Roadie T-shirt, purple sun glasses, my sandles, and an American Flag doo rag, complete with long blonde hair. When I got to play practice, I was told that I had to get makeup put on... so I went into the music room behind the stage, and began the whole process of ""beautifying"" myself so that I would show up on stage behind the bright lights. Tiffany Berry put on my make up. I love her, she's so great. :D She did everything to me, except for my mascara. I think Kate Thompson did that for me... or was it Andy? I can't tell... Andy and Kate Thompson are twins. :) Anyhow, they did a good job. I liked it when Tiffany put on my make up, because she was very gentle and made some very nice comments about my skin and how I looked with base on my face. She even gave me some chocolate lip gloss... it was wild. *sigh* She's so great. :D hehe... I mean, she was approximately one and a half inches away from my face. I think I had the thought of kissing her run past my head while I was looking into her eyes while she was working on my eyeshadow. :D The only thing that sucks is that I think she has a boyfriend, and anyhow, I have Amanda. :D So anyhow, play practice lasted until like, 10:00 or 11:00, I'm unsure. Right now, I'm in the middle of doing Christy Burleson's bellbottoms decorations. She wanted me to put some of the stuff that I have on my bellbottoms on hers. You see, I painted a few slogans and phrases of the era on my pants, and she loved them. I put ""Groovy, Baby!"" across her butt, and in the front, I'm going to place ""Make love, not war."" slightly around her crotch area. *lol* She wanted it that way. Tomorrow is the first day of performances for the Senior Play, I don't really know the schedule that well, but I do know that I have to endure getting make-up put on me yet again, and adjusting my hair again to cover up my natural dark brown hair. I hope I don't screw anything up tomorrow, and I hope the other people don't forget their lines :)<BR><BR>On the brightest side of things, I get to endure Tiffany Berry doing my makeup again. :) Good ol' Scary Berry :D hehehe... Really though, on the 24th, my final fantasy 3 movie that I submitted to <A href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/""><U><FONT color=#c0c0c0>Newgrounds.com</U></FONT></A> was <B><U>FEATURE OF THE DAY!!!!</B></U> The most I was hoping for was for it to be added to the Final Fantasy Collection on NG, and I got that! It was added to the Final Fantasy Collection, and the Video Games collection. :D hehe AND It was Feature of the Day!! :D I was very very enthused. It was a great end to a bad day. I need to go shave so Tiffany won't have to fight my facial hair while applying base. :) <A href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=85391""><U><FONT color=#00ffff>Click here to go to the page to see my movie on Newgrounds.com!

<P class=c2><A name=87290971>Well.. it turns out that Derick decided to go to the honor band. I stayed there from 2:00 until about 8:30. I'm tired. The symphonic band director was an African-American dude who knew how to play the friggin baritone. In fact... he had 4 solos during a song that he was accompanied by the band..... it was very pretty, and very fast. It sounded like the song that Bugs Bunny usually played on the piano, when Yosemite Sam tried to get him to play the right key, so that an explosive would go off and kill him... but in the end, Bugs would never play the right key, and Yosemite would get tired of Bugs not playing it right, and he would blow himself up in the end..... anyhow, the dude was good. :-) He's one of the faculty members of Alabama State University. (One of the lesser-known colleges in the state) Basically I spent my time walking around campus, freezing my butt off. It was very, very cold, like it always is every year. I was reminded of what my half sister did the day before, because of someone telling me not to crap my pants (I had to go to the bathroom really bad).... it turns out that Kelli had peed in her pants previously... mom was ticked off about it big time. Well, about three hours later, Kelli was behind the couch... and mom started smelling something like someone farted...... then she said that it smelled like someone crapped in their pants! So mom yelled at Kelli... looked behind the couch, and sure enough, Kelli's pants were in the floor, filled with feces. I think Kelli got a really bad spanking afterwards... and a bath. I thought it was funny. I got home from the honor band at about 9:00 or so... I met Matt.... can't think of his last name...... there..... but Casey Duckworth wasn't there. :-( I told someone from his band to tell him that Joe said hi... but I highly doubt the message will get to him. Maybe our paths will cross once again... he's a good guy. Anyhow, I'm going to go satiate my craving for some RotS :-)</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_05_incanus_archive.html#87290971""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/11/2003 10:31:36 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87273298>Well, I woke up this morning at approximately 10:01 AM. I then got up, called Derick to see if he was feeling any better, because he's been at home sick for the past two days. I talked to him for a little bit, then I got online. I was thinking while I got in the shower about a good song from the past -- 311's ""Flowing"". I decided that I knew what I was going to try to include into my web site that i'm creating entirely in flash... definitely that song for looping background music. In a little bit, if Amanda doesn't call me, I am going to go to Phil Campbell to the college to see her at the honor band. Maybe I'll be able to catch her for her lunch break. I love her. :-) I made a little test movie with 31 different pictures in it... and 31 pictures is not going to work... the file size is too large for a looping background movie clip... so I'm thinking about cutting it down to about 6 pictures that loop over in the background with the looping music. It was slowing the computer down big time when it changed to the big pictures suddenly... so it isn't going to work out that way. :-) It'll be pretty neat. I'm considering making this web site about myself... kind of like this blog. Well, I think I'm going to go change clothes... try to wear something unrecognizable, play with my rabbit so she doesn't become depressed... and then leave... yep.... I'm going.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_05_incanus_archive.html#87273298""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/11/2003 01:35:29 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87184845>Just got home... went by Movie Gallery to get a new application, because my old one got all crinkled up and stuff... so I figured I'd try to get a new one just in case I couldn't fix my old one... I didn't want to go back in and ask for another application, so I had my mom go in... she told them that she wanted to pick up an application for her daugther (Kelli is 5 right now)... and the lady looked around for a long while and couldn't find any applications. Mom asked if they were hiring any part time jobs, and the person told her that ""I think we just hired some guy yesterday."" So, as far as I can hope... I was that guy. I came in and asked for an application, and the person I asked it from seemed to be the manager... I wasn't sure... but if I happen to be ""that guy"" then all I have to do is turn in this application after I re-type my resume... and I should have landed a job. :-) I explained how I had those other teachers be my references... and Mrs. Middleton told me that she would call them and talk to them telling them why they should hire me, if I wanted her to... I told her that it might just be a possibility. You see, Mrs. Middleton was my Marketing teacher. I was always the 1st person to finish my work in that class... and I had like, a 100 average both semesters there... when everyone else had C's and B's and crap. I was her ""star student"". It was in marketing that Mrs. Middleton let me just skip what the rest of the class was doing so that I could go off to another building in my own little ""office"" and work on the city website. She rules so very much. :-) I think in all reality, Mrs. Middleton was one of the best teachers I have had. I learned a lot about life in her class... a lot about the real world in which I now live. :-) Well, I'm talking to Dave right now, so that's all I have to say for now. :-)<BR><BR>if you have <A href=""http://www.kazaa.com/"" target=annonedhellenedrohiammen><FONT color=#c1d5ff>Kazaa</FONT></A>, then I suggest downloading ""<I>The Boys of Summer</I>"" by DJ Sammy.

<P class=c2><A name=87117967>I'm in programming yet again. First period this morning, all of the juniors left class to go take the ASVAB test... so that left 2 seniors in the class room with Mrs. Posey. Soon afterwards, four other seniors from my class came into the room. I wouldn't really call them my friends... merely acquaintences. We talked for a little bit, and then before class was over, we just decided to leave. We walked up to Mrs. Posey and said ""bye."" and she said ""bye."" and we all just left. It was cool. In AP English, we finished class early, so we spent 20 minutes reading the book that is due in two weeks - ""Wuthering Heights"". I am kind of ancy about this afternoon... I want to hurry up and go to Movie Gallery so I can get my application. :) I have waited so long to work, and now I finally can. I'm happy that I get the chance. I think we may abandon our projects in Programming/Project Development, because our teacher asked us ""Tell me honestly... how many of you would be overly disappointed if we just stopped doing our projects."" I looked around the nearly empty classroom and no hands went up. Then she went to answer a phone and she is still talking on it, so we might just abandon our projects and actually learn some more programming languages. I've been wanting to sharpen my javascript skills badly. :-) I feel so incredibly tired. I went to sleep shortly after I wrote my last post last night... and I woke up at 6:00 AM as always this morning. However, I did not get out of bed until about 6:42. My alarm clock goes off every 6 minutes when I hit the sleep timer. It is a CD player alarm clock... so when the alarm goes off, it blasts Track 13 off of the Fellowship of the Ring Soundtrack, The Bridge of Khazad-Dum in my ear... so it always wakes me up sure-fire guaranteed. My friend Chad and I went to run an errand to get a tape recorder a while ago... and in the hallway I stopped Kelsi Taylor to get a picture of her... I made her laugh and smile... and shortly afterwards, Chad whispered to me, ""You da pimp."" I laughed at that remark. He's an awesome-cool guy... a very very good friend. :-) So very bored... can't wait to get home.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_05_incanus_archive.html#87117967""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/8/2003 10:33:43 AM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87098560>It's late, and I'm extremely tired. But I managed to get Hadhafang to level 20. He is specialized in wild fighting. Since he has a 17 strength, and his 23 dex more than makes up for his ranger skills... i figure he could use some wild fighting skills to make him even tougher. It's cool so far. Earwyn is a pretty cool character. The characters that she plays are all female, but I don't know if she's a female in real life. I don't have much else to say, except that after school tomorrow, I'm going to swing by Movie Gallery and put in an application. I'm tired of being unemployed. It's time for me to join the work force. :) I need money, desperately. I owe $50 for my stupid down payment on the band trip to national competition... our band director is that confident that we're going to make it... and do well... but you see, I don't have $50 to give him... so I might not get to go on this trip. Oh well... hopefully I'll get this job! I can only pray...</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_05_incanus_archive.html#87098560""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/7/2003 11:36:38 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87079168>I made it home from the last time i will ever have a first day of my final semester of high school.... ever again. Yeah, that is a mouthful, but it's cool. :) I took my digital camera to school and took 20 pictures of some of my teachers, and people at school. I would upload them to this site, but since this is just a blog, then I can't do that... as far as I know. :) I walked in my room after I got home and went to grab my USB cable that i use to connect my camera to my computer with, and I saw that my Playstation 2 was knocked over inside my desk where i have it sitting on a shelf... my half-sister had gotten into my room earlier today and ""played"" with my belongings... that ticks me off incredibly. Mrs. Birmingham, my Algebra 2 teacher, is so very cool. She's awesome. Our assignment in programming/project development was to design the cover page for our project report. I was going to get a picture of the ocean with a small tropical island, and then have the moon rising up behind the island, and adding some kind of cool effects or something... but i could never find a decent picture of a tropical island. I suppose i'll have to make one myself eventually. It seems that most of my teammates on this stupid project are going to change schedules on me, so I'll just be stuck with a few people. I really can't see the importance of our project... there really is no importance. It's just a dumb thing we have to enter into a competition and hopefully make a good name for our school. I could care less about giving our school a good name. I already do that enough in the band. (That I hate so very much) We're getting together the music that we are going to play for District Competition, State Competition, and National Competition. So far, Mr. Williams, our band director, is probably going to make us play the New World Symphony by Dvorak. We're also probably going to play Barnum and Bailey's Favorite for a stupid warm-up march. *sigh* Being in the band for 8 years straight really ruins your fun for it... especially if your director is anything like Mr. Williams. He's a great man and all, but he can just ruin fun after a while. It gets old.... very old. He expects you to make band your life. To him, band is life. We are a professional organization in his eyes... but he seems to oversee the fact that we're only teenagers, with many other interests and frustrations. Not all of us are going to go to college and be in the band. (I strongly recommend not joining the band if you do go to college, or even if you're a high schooler considering joining..... dont' do it...... it isn't worth it in the long-run.) It is probably the most time-consuming thing that I have ever done. I don't know why I ever joined back in the 5th grade.... what was I thinking!? *sigh* Oh well, I guess it has made me into a responsible adult... that's about the only thing it's given me. I don't know how I'm going to tie in computer information systems with knowing how to play the tuba. :-) 
<P><BR><BR>It seems that next Tuesday I have to get a physical for my insurance... oh boy. On an unrelated note.... ice cream is really good. I had an ice cream cone (a waffle cone at that) from McDonald's today, and it tasted wonderful. Well, I think I've rambled on a good bit for now. Time for me to go play some RotS... maybe something interesting will come about.</A> <BR><SMALL>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_05_incanus_archive.html#87079168""><FONT color=#c0c0c0>1/7/2003 04:09:51 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87035005>Blowing up empty 3 liter bottles is fun. Simply fill the bottle up with water, and then get some bottle rockets. Light a bottle rocket, and then instead of placing the bottle rocket as if it were to shoot upwards in the air, aim the bottle rocket down into the bottle. It will fire into the water, and 98% of the time, will not go out. Then, while it is in the water, it will explode, causing the water to explode, and sometimes, even causing the bottle itself to hop off of the ground. :-) Fireworks are fun. Oh, on a side note..... when the bottle rocket has shot into the bottle... you may want to step back a little..... or you'll get wet. :-)</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_05_incanus_archive.html#87035005""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/6/2003 07:38:01 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87025670>Well, I just spoke with Derick, and I found out that he isn't moving for Frisco until after graduation, so we still get to do our fun Senior Trip stuff together and whatnot. Every bit of money he earns is going to be saved to help him and his family move. The depressing thing for him is that if he moves, he will have to part with his dogs.... Lucky and Bogey. Lucky is a little chiuhaha or however that word is spelled (I will learn to spell it one day), and Bogey is a fuzzy little smeller-dog. He likes to smell you a lot. I told Derick that if they couldn't work out having their dogs in their home in Frisco, that I would be willing to keep them and take care of them until they could make arrangements. I love Derick. He's like my brother, more than my friend. He loves his dogs a whole lot, and I mean a WHOLE lot... parting with them would be like murder in a degree. But hopefully everything will work out. I got my hair cut. It's a whole lot shorter than it used to be, and I don't have a headache from having so much dang hair on my head. I feel like playing RotS again. For some reason I can't get the friggin links to my favorite websites to appear on the header of this blog. I'll figure it out sometime. Maybe I'll be able to log in while i'm at school and work on this... we have a stupid security program/firewall called ""NetOp"" and ""Fortres"" that pretty much blocks all students from accessing cool websites, and checking email... like <A href=""http://www.hotmail.com/"" target=lethioiphilinn><FONT color=#c1d5ff>Hotmail</FONT></A> or that crappy Yahoo email site. ( I hate Yahoo, btb.) :) For future reference about RotS.... if you're ever in Troy's, and you need to get some rafts... the hidden door name is ""brokenboard"" Yeah, you're welcome if you're coming here searching for information about RotS. Maybe I'll write a few little helpful hints about the game here while i'm at it. I don't know. If you came here reading this personal crap about my life, and you play RotS... be sure to come back and check to see what all is up. And if you're here out of boredom or an accident, or if I told you to come here.... Thank you for coming and taking your time to read this. My thoughts can be incredibly mysterious sometimes, or very intriguing, but mostly.....they're...uh.....strange....unique.....novel. I changed the template of the blog, so maybe it looks cooler now...hopefully those bloody links will show up. Oh well. Later.

<P class=c2><A name=87016989>Today has been a mixed day so far. It's the day before I begin my final semester of high school. I'm looking forward to not having to take Economics in high school ever again, and Democracy should be a piece of cake, despite memorizing the entire Constitution. My best friend, Derick Thomas gave me a call, and informed me that in about two months' time, he will be moving to the greater San Fransisco area. Yeah, this was a hard impact on me. I've got to give him a call later. I began playing <A href=""http://www.rots.org/""><FONT color=#c1d5ff>Return of the Shadow</FONT></A> again today... After taking a month-and-a-half long break, I've began playing an Elf Ranger again, Hadhafang. He's pretty awesome. His stats are promising... but I doubt that I'll get as addicted to the game as I did last time. For those of you not in the know, Return of the Shadow is a MUD, a Multi-user demension (or dungeon) however you like to view it. 
<P><BR>I've been meaning to start a blog for quite some time now, but have never had the amount of stuff to talk about. Now, I feel that I do. I may take some time to buy a domain later on, and actually upload my <A href=""http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/incanus/""><FONT color=#c1d5ff>character site</FONT></A> to it. I aspire to become a web designer, or something of the like later on in life. When I go to college, I'm going to major in Computer Science.... lovely, eh? I don't fancy myself that good at math, but I can pick up on computer stuff quite fast. It's sad. I'm a Senior, and i'm taking Computer Programming (and Project Development) and the only language I know is VB. I don't even know all of VB yet, because we stopped doing VB to begin working on bullcrap project development for the <A href=""http://aspire.cs.uah.edu/""><FONT color=#c1d5ff>ASPIRE</FONT></A> competition. It's a bunch of crap that I don't really enjoy, and probably won't benefit from. The project i'm developing is basically ""How long will it take for the moon to leave the earth's orbit, to cause a major difference in ocean's tides."" Our computer programming/project development teacher likes to be very hard on us, and she makes us specify already specified stuff. Like if I break down a sentence into specifics, she wants it even more specific. Then in the end, she just gives me a headache, and makes me wish that I had taken a different class. 
<P><BR>I hate band. I have been in the band for 8 years now, and it's sad. I hate being in it, and it is another reason for why I cannot wait to graduate. I need to get my driver license soon. I don't have a job... i don't have a car.... i've got a girl (Amanda Walter)..... hey, doesn't that sound like an old song........ bleh..... i don't know what the name of it is, oh well. I just found out that the place i was going to get my hair cut at is only open Tuesday-Saturday. *sigh* I wanted to get my hair cut today so bad. It's getting extremely thick, and unmanagable. My half sister is annoying. She is 5. She doesn't know how to shut up and leave me alone. 
<P><BR>Maybe I'll find something else to speak of later. Peace.

<P class=c2><A name=87595414>I'm in programming... Amanda is severely ticked off at me, because I slapped her butt a little too hard, and I wouldn't let her touch my stomach since I was hurting a little, and then for some reason I tried to touch hers... you know, just put my hand there and stuff, but she got very angry because I wouldn't let her, and she hit me, so I slapped her butt, so she hit me again, and I slapped her butt again, just playing around, and now she's ticked off... hopefully she won't break up with me. We've been together for almost 2 years, and that would suck a lot if she did. It's already happened almost last November... she and I degraded our relationship to ""dating"" for about 3 weeks, then she got back together with me in December. Robert is home, I want him to leave. I am very tired, because he wouldn't shut up last night. I wanted to sleep. I hope today gets better. Amanda is leaving for 2 days to spend the night at Heather's house for her birthday party. *sigh* I just hope she doesn't stay mad at me.. I'll have to think of some good stuff to say to make up for this. *sigh* Today SUCKS.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_incanus_archive.html#87595414""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/17/2003 10:23:43 AM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87556585>Kelli just threw a handful of beads at mom while she was sitting down, watching TV... she threw them hard too, and almost put out mom's eyes. Mom got up and beat the living sh** out of her. Kelli wouldn't stop crying... I don't blame mom for screaming at the top of her lungs so that you couldn't understand what the heck was coming out of her mouth... she called Kelli a little b***h, while screaming at the top of her lungs. I was glad that Kelli got the crap beaten out of her... she really needs it. She's a very very very very very very extremely incredibly unbelievable undeniable HORRIBLE child. She does NOT listen, EVER. She ALWAYS screams at the top of her lungs, even when she's happy. She wont' shut up when you tell her to, and she just basically always throws a fit until she gets her way. She's had her way all of her life. Mom just said ""I swear to God, if I would have known how you would have turned out, I would have had an abortion."" She also previously stated, ""Why don't you run away and leave?"" Kelli is just so stupid. It's sad. I don't know what the heck prompted her to do that, but whatever it was, it was stupid. I hate living in this house.... 
<P><BR><BR>On the bright side of things... I may be getting a laptop computer for only $499.95! Mom is going to be making payments on it through Sweepstakes Clearing House in Dallas, TX. I had to look up the company through the Better Business Bureau, because it is a mail-order type business. They turned out to be legit, so things are kind of cool... though the computer is kind of a piece of junk... only 48MB RAM, and a Intel Pentium 233 MHz processor.... but still... it would do the job for me taking notes in College. Right now, I'm in the process of looking up a better deal online.. maybe I can find one at Dell. Dave is helping me find another one somewhere. It is friggin cold outside today. It was raining freezing rain before I got out of school.. hopefully we will have a Snow Day tomorrow, and our 4 day weekend turns into a 5 day weekend. :) I really hope that that is the case! My friend Nathan is going to Wal-Mart to pick up an application for me today. I'm going to fill that sucker out and turn it in fast! If I can't get a job at Movie Gallery, I'll take a job at Wal-Mart like a heart-attack takes a fat man in an all-you-can-eat 20oz. hamburger eating contest! Yeah... good similie there. :) Amanda's stomach was hurting today... she kept saying she was having sharp pains. I have two bruises on my neck from where she attacked me this morning before school and hung onto me like a leech. :-) They kind of hurt... one on both side of my neck. I have a journal now in Programming that I have to write what i do each day inside the journal. For future references, today in programming, I looked up a volume control slider tutorial in Flash... I only got halfway through it though. I'll finish it up tomorrow, and then work on incorporating it into the all-flash website. *sigh* Too many bad things have happened... maybe good things will turn out later.</A> <BR><SMALL>Olorin // <A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_incanus_archive.html#87556585""><FONT color=#c0c0c0>1/16/2003 04:42:14 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87509619>Well, today was an eventful day thus far. I went to school dreading it all, -- all of the make up work that i missed during my 2 day absence. I have a test tomorrow morning before school in Chemistry, and proceeding that is an AP English test. Well, during AP English, right before break, they announced the people who were nominated for Mr. and Ms. Havala for the school year... I was like the 2nd person announced, and immediately afterwards, I said ""What he heck!?"" out loud in my class. hehe... several other people were nominated as well. I have to write an essay and then I have to fill out a list explaining my school activities, and my honors and such... then I have to go to an interview and answer their questions and such... there are ten areas in which i can be scored, on a scale of 1-10. Hopefully I'll do well. I need to ask Amanda's mom if she will be my community reference.. then when Mrs. Logan returns, I'm going to ask her to be my teacher reference. Well... when I got home, Snowbelle, my rabbit had gotten out of her cage... and luckily for me, she didn't pee or poop anywhere on my bed. :-) I put her back in her cage and fixed the part of the wire cover that had a hole torn in it.... and another great thing that happened to me today -- on RotS:<BR><BR>HP:Hurt, an Easterling bandit:Awful&gt;<BR>You lightly pierce an Easterling bandit's right arm.<BR>An Easterling bandit is dead!

<P class=c2><A name=87380733>After watching the head explosion bit a few times... I really can't tell if this guy's head <I>really did explode</I>, or if it's a nice computer trick. It looks as if something exploded or detonated behind his head... I'm not sure. Wouldn't an explosion of that magnitude cause his clothing to become soiled? hmm... I'll have to check this out again sometime soon.... what do you think?

<P class=c2><A name=87379497>Josh Franks is this blog's biggest fan. *lol* If you're friggin bored out of your mind, there are two websites I suggest going and visiting... firstly, this one.... <A href=""http://www.athf.com/games.htm"" target=newonehehehe><FONT color=#c1d5ff>Aqua Teen Hunger Force Games</FONT></A> ATHF is friggin awesome, especially Meatwad, I love him to death. hehe Secondly, there is <A href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/"" target=thehomeoftheportal><FONT color=#c0c0c0>Newgrounds.com</FONT></A>. This is a great website to go that has tons of user-submitted flash cartoons and games and whatnot. A few of my flash animations can be found there... as a matter of fact, my first two flash animations can be found there... to find them, just go to search, and type in <I>Incanus</I> The two that are there are My first one, <I>Elf Vs. Orc - In Greenwood</I> and then the 2nd one there is <I>Tribute to Tribute</I> the second one is cooler, and funnier. These were my first two animations.. my newer stuff is by far better. Whenever i finish working on this project in programming/project development, I'll post a link here. There's also this animation at newgrounds that was submitted this morning, that the staff are contemplating about deleting or keeping, because it features a guy's head exploding and blood splashing everywhere... <A href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=77523"" target=thisguysheadexplodes><I><FONT color=#c1d5ff>Anti-Clock Lesson</FONT></I></A> You should definitely check it out if you feel a little violent today... heck, you should check it out anyways. The voice over of the clock guy is kind of crappy, but still, the explosion is worth it.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_incanus_archive.html#87379497""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/13/2003 06:16:09 PM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87363358>Well... I'm not going to school today. It was extremely cold this morning, and mom couldn't get up or anything... so she's staying home and i'm taking care of her. Amanda is probably going to get ticked off at me.. but hopefully she will understand that I had to take care of mom. If she can't understand, then oh well. Tomorrow I have to go get a physical, so I'm going to miss the first 2, and possibly the first 3 classes of school. *sigh* I miss Amanda... I wish I could get a hug right now. Anyhow... I was playing RotS earlier today as Hadhafang, and you won't belive this...

<P class=c2><A name=87341405>12:36 AM... and I didn't do one bit of my psychology homework...... nor read any of Wuthering Heights. I don't care about making the title of the book itallic either. And I don't care much for spelling or grammar right now either. I am psuedo-watching Adult Swim on the Cartoon Network... there's this commercial type thing that I want to see again sometime... or even download, that features the characters from the old 60's cartoon <I>The Herculoids</I>..... whoa..... I just made that itallic, and not the title of a book.......... what the heck am I thinking? hehe..... anyhow.... it features <I>those guys</I> talking about something..... a doody? or whatever.... and their voices are replaced with little kid and baby voices... and then this robot type monster laughs like a baby when Zandor gets killed or something..... I don't know what the deal is, but it's funny and entertaining. I burned a copy of the .fla file that i've been working on for my programming project development project onto a CD so I can take it to school tomorrow and stick it on the computer I sit at. I'm going to give Amanda her keychain in the morning. It's two little frogs that hug each other, and are exactly alike. She gets one and I get the other. I think she'll like it a lot... but they are <I>kind of</I>...........large. hehe Tomorrow night, it's supposed to snow... and if it does, then it will stick, because the temperature right now is a whopping <I>17 degrees F!!</I> Yeah.... I'm going to bed.... with my extra warm underoos tonight............ j/k.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_incanus_archive.html#87341405""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/13/2003 12:45:00 AM</FONT></A></SMALL>&nbsp;<BR><BR><STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P class=c2><A name=88008020>Mom's husband has been home every single day since last Saturday... I am sick and tired of listening to his bull crap. I am tired. He doesn't shut up at night, and he has the TV on really loud past 11:00 PM.... I can't sleep. The need to kill is rising.... I just have to make it through this weekend, and then he <B>should be leaving</B> but I am not going to get up my hopes..... going to go play GTA3 again...... *sigh* My hotmail email account had about 150 new messages. It said that I was about to go over my account storage limit. *chuckle* I deleted all of them. None of them were of extreme importance... if not, I can always talk to the people who sent it to me, and ask them what it was about. Okay, going to go play now.</A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_19_incanus_archive.html#88008020""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/25/2003 10:06:01 AM</FONT></A></SMALL> <BR>

<P class=c2><A name=87846088>Well, it's been a while since I've posted anything... about 4 days if I can think correctly. I spent my weekend playing Grand Theft Auto 3... I'm kicking that game's butt. I am so screwed today. After school, I am going to have to stay after to take a novel test on a novel that I haven't read -- Wuthering Heights. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay after to take it... so there goes a 0 in the grade book for me. Today, my fortune has been running short. Hopefully it will get better... I pray that it will..... after school I am going to have to read the novel anyhow, since Friday I have an in-class essay on it. *sigh* Oh well, either way it goes, I'm screwed. Now, I've got to start working on my flash stuff in programming/project development. *sigh* .....<B>*SIGH*</B></A> <BR><SMALL><FONT size=1>Olorin // </FONT><A href=""http://incanus.blogspot.com/2003_01_19_incanus_archive.html#87846088""><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=1>1/22/2003 10:17:21 AM</FONT></A><SMALL><SMALL><SMALL></P></SMALL></SMALL></SMALL></SMALL>"

Now, you will be able to reply to my posts and give me your feedback.  I posted all of my old posts from my old blog on blogger, and unfortunately, most of the links I had in there didn't copy over to here, but oh well.  A lot of those places didn't need links anyhow. =)  Feel free to reply to any of my posts, and tell me what you think about what I had to say.  I have nothing to hide, and I have very little shame. =)

I do have a few rules though for posting, so please read these and abide by them:

<b>No pissing everyone else off</b>

That's pretty much it.  I'm a care-free guy, and I'm very lenient.  You can swear up and down in your replies, and I won't give a damn.  Just don't use the only swear word I try not to say ever - God D*** and all of its forms.  Thanks for stopping by, and leave a comment or two! =)  I need some encouragement on how the page's colors should look. lol

Happy Memorial Day Weekend 2004! =)

"event","I started my cycling training yesterday. A doctor I work with is coaching me. My goal is to go to BIKE VIRGINIA next June. Its about a 270 mile/6 day event.

"event","today is my ex's birthday..why i care i don't know. i don't guess i do i just remember dates very well. especially since the first two guys i slept with had their birthday on the same day. and the third's (ex) bday was the day before. werid. the 4th guy's bday was the same as my OTHER best friends bday. anyway not important. # 5 is the keeper. (i always said id stay on one hand...apc!)
enough about my sex life. my life is pretty good. thought i was pregnant a month or so ago but im not. God knows when its time and it just wasnt the right time plus we're not even married yet. I may do lots of things backwards but this is one thing i want to do right. We're going to the beach the 5th and 6th of May (or to Carowinds and Jordan Lake).  Carowinds is in Charlotte and its like six flags only on a smaller scale...i think..could be bigger? Jordan Lake is up toward Raleigh-chapel hill area. You can rent a boat for the whole day and just float on the lake not a care in the world. plus we're going on a weekday so not alot of ppl are gonna be there hopefully. We need a vacation. our anniversary is one week from monday:) i love will so much. we argue but we're perfect moreso than not. i know that our meeting was nothing more than God's work. It had to be. Timing was a very key factor and everything fell into place like it was supposed to. If you'd told me this time last year that id be buying a house and marrying ""the cute guard"" i woulda laughed probably.
Dreams do come true and i got mine:) I only hope everyone in the world can know whats it like to wake up every single morning next to the one you love. It's amazing. we have 5 dogs that keep us busy. three hethen dogs that dont know their names nor do they stay in the fence. one that keeps showing the other 3 how to dig holes in my yard and one that rules in the inside.  lol he's a boy but i paint his nails pink:) hehe anyway i must get my scatter brain back to work.

And we finally got our fence put up this weekend so the dogs won't drive me crazy.  I love my boyfriend.  He is so amazing.  We fuss and fight like any other couple but our relationship is so perfect.  He was meant for me. He is my destiny and well thats the end of the story i suppose....The end for now..until he decides to hurry up and propose to me!! hehehe. Oh yeah i found this weekend that a very close friend of mine, a dear lady ive known since i was 5 (17 years) and who taught me in 2nd, 3rd, and 5th grade when i lived in alabama and whom ive kept in contact with all these years...passed away last monday.  she had already retired like 3 times when she taught me in 2nd grade i believe so she was probably around 80 or 90 when she passed.  She taught me a great many lessons and shes the reason i want to pursue a career in teaching. Maybe ill get that degree one day. Anyway just thought id catch up a little bit. No one ever reads this anyway."

So its now the last day of january ..in the year 2005 and i, at 22 yrs old, have everything (almost) that ive always wanted. my lovely wonderful caring sweet boyfriend and i closed on our new house on january 13th and we've painted it and gotten all new appliances and furniture and all that good stuff.  we have three dogs (elie, bear, and jaxi) that complete our lives.  jaxi is my baby. i love that lil squirt immensely.  so anyway i love our house and i love my job and will got bumped up to full time finally which is good only his schedule isnt ""set in stone"" so if i happen to make valentines plans i have to make sure he asks to work 1st shift so we can go to raleigh for the night..mmm cant wait.  also, my best friend adam has gone to costa rica for the semester and he calls occasionally.  id love to go visit but right now water lines and privacy fences are more important than that. amazing how your views on things change when u step into the real world for just a minute.  lol i got paid today...80 percent of my check is gone...but then again almos all the bills are paid too. anyway thats whats up with my life.  hope all is well in everyone elses life.  my other best friend kara is supposed to be coming to visit the end of march...hope so hope so hope so

Ya know...when people say ""God'll send you who he wants for you"".  They really mean it (not that I doubted them one bit). And when they say ""It'll happen when God wants it to""...they're also right.  I started dating a guy last December 30th and we were together until February 3rd (well the 31st of Jan is when he cheated on me..but anyway).  I have found it absolutely heart wrenching to get over this miniscule relationship.  God sent me my ""somebody"" just when he wanted to.  I met Will on July 2nd and we've been together every single day since then.  It's all sorta funny how we met.  I thought he was cute (hes a guard at the gate to the country club where my mom lives) so i mailed him a letter to one of the gates but it got returned. so im thinking its not meant to be.  Well my parents left on a week and a half long trip that i was SUPPOSED to be on but i decided at the last minute to stay.  Pinewild Property Owner's Association decided they wanted to change decals so i had to go in to the 211 gatehouse to get my new one and who would be there but my future love.:)  Anyway we've been together and wonderfully happy ever since.  In fact we find out wednesday if we get approved for our house (cross ur fingers).  So I'm happy as can be despite the fact that Ive seen my ex a handful of times since we split up.  I finally saw his new girl and if she can put up with him shes a mighty good woman.  Anyway I was in walmart with will getting our last christmas presents and i had to run get some razors and shave gel while will went to the spiderman section of walmart.  while coming up the aisle who do i see but Guy Lyndon McGraw and he speaks to me.  AND HE WAS NICE! HE said he'd heard i had a new man and just then my Will walked up and i introduced them but we caught up a little bit.  he has no intentions of marrying andrea anytime soon. but whatever floats his boat. HE did, though, apologize for how it ended and said he still thought the world of me and that i was one of the sweetest girls he'd ever met (i seriously doubt the latter) but i dunno...as much as ive tried to get over him nothing did it til then.  i actually dont have my heart skip a beat everytime i see a red 2door blazer or red honda accord.  i dont gasp for air when i pass the village market on the way to get the mail when i see a moore county truck in the parking lot at the slightest chance it might be him.  Im glad it ended the way it did.  Im glad God found it in his heart to send me the man of my dreams and im even glad he let me spend 5 weeks with Guy.  Everything , dear friends, happens for a reason. This is the best year and although the first part of it was kinda rocky im glad it happened and i wouldnt trade any of my life experiences.  i was watching mr holland's opus earlier and ""visions of a sunset"" by one of the guys from boyz II men was playing and i was remembering what a good life i really did have.  we played that in middle school band .  those were the days i tell ya.  i had just made a drastic change in my life moving to another state and changing friends only a year earlier.  i have been through some good things and some not so good things but at this point in my life i dont think id trade any of it.  i love my job and the people i work with and my best friend kara and my boyfriend will:) thank you god for seeing fit for me to have these things.  thank you from the very bottom of my heart. 

Love J.
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to those of you that i may not know that read this.

"event","not really much to say.  ive been feeling a bit anxious lately, though im not entirely sure why. we find out next week (or at the latest, the monday after t'giving) if we got approved for our house! its soo awesome. its older but its all brick and has columns on the front porch and a deck on the back and a concrete driveway.  we get $3000 back at closing to buy all new (BLACK!!!) appliances and we'll have enough to add on to the neighbors' privacy fencing so the dogs wont get out and we wont have to tie them out anymore.  elie's got a place on her arm where her steel cable (that she has chewed through more than once) has rubbed and i feel horribly neglectful. rocko's getting big.  lol i talk about my dogs as if they were my kids...well i guess maybe they are, for now. ben and chrystal came over last night for supper and spades and they brought their son brendon along.  he's so cute i can't wait to have kids.  ben's gonna try to pull some strings (and maybe RAF will too) to get will a telemetry tech position at moore regional.  that would be so awesome.  we'd work like 1/4 mile away from each other and he'd make WAY more money than he does now.  almost double to be exact.  oh please pray that he gets it! We'd have even more to put into savings then.  Then when we get our taxes back in february or march we're takin a vacation and i wanna 4wheeler! we live kinda out in the country.  why not!?  anyways i must go for now. the lexapro seems to be working pretty good.  *cross your fingers*

oh yeah and for the first time in ELEVEN YEARS! my best friend and i have boyfriends at the same time.  and good ones at that! go us! go us! maybe a double wedding in the bahamas IS in the future:)

"event","Today, actually the past week or so, has been so blah.  I wish so much that all memories or thoughts of any type related to my stupid ex could be erased from my mind.  I have a boyfriend that I love very much, but sometimes it just urks me when i think about it.  I can't help but think about it since we run into each other so much lately.  I mean it felt so good to see his new gf finally and see that shes fat and gross and skanky and nothing like me ..certainly not better lol.  I guess I can't completely get over it because I dont know WHY it ended.  Theres no need to know why, though, because he is such a loser. I found out after we broke (ie. he cheated on me) that he was doing Cocaine the whole time.  I mean who has three jobs and only a truck pmt, insurance and a cell phone bill and has $0?  I didn't just assume coke was the culprit..I knew he did it on New Year's.  And by the way the saying that whoever you're with on new years is who you're with the rest of the year...yeah thats a lie.  We were only together from 12/30/03-2/7/04.  WHY CANT I GET THE STUPID FUCKER OUT OF MY MIND? I hate him ! I don't want to think about him.  I love Will Whitley more than anything.  He has ambition and he's in school and he knows what he wants in his life and doesnt do drugs..oh and he adores me.  Guy McGraw on the other hand I hate, he has no ambition, he digs ditches for a living, he's 29 yrs old, does drugs, is dating a girl thats 20 and has a kid and they live with HER parents now.  they bounce around from one room post offices to his moms house and now to her parents' ...what a life huh? now why i cant stop thinking about the latter...i have no idea. anyone got any suggestions lemme know

Til next time.

"event","Just thought I'd update for the first time in MONTHS.  I don't think anyone reads this anyway unless I make a point to tell them to and even then i dont get comments so it doesnt really matter.  But for all of you who would like to know what's going on in my life..here goes...
Life is absolutely wonderful(and i can say that..cuz i dont believe in jinxes..right DD?) I love my job (99.9% of the time) I love my car (also..99.9% of the time). I love my boyfriend (all the time).  We've been together since the beginning of the summer and he's positively perfect:) He's everything I always wanted in a guy and could never find.  He's romantic and sweet and does things for no reason and he's ambitious and thoughtful and caring and everything to me.  I jus found out a few friends of mine are expecting so thats exciting. i wanna have a couple of kids..maybe three...but not anytime soon.  maybe in about 4 years (after im married) ill start trying.  already got the names picked out and everything.  anyway back to reality.  ive decided im gonna stay in my little house for the next year or so ..so will and i can save up some money for the house of our dreams.  as long as it has a bay window , a garden tub, and a red door im cool with it.  anyway ive just had about a half hour conversation with a girl i work with in between writing this so im spent.  ill write more later.  feel free to comment if u like:)  oh yeah...COME ON REBS!! U CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT!! LETS BE SEC WEST CHAMPS THIS YEAR!!"

"event","i haven't updated in quite some time.  i no longer have a roommate.  i have been living by myself since the end of october (officially the 10th of nov).  i got a new job at carolina behavioral care the 15th of december.  i love it... absolutely love it! and to risk jinxing it (...hearing denise's voice in my head..""dont overanalyze!!!!""..thanks D)
i met a guy.  actually ive known him since summer '02 but he was engaged.  she broke up with him a few weeks before christmas with the whole ""i gotta make sure ur the right one"" deal and he wasnt standin for it.  so anyway i was somwhere i hadnt been in ages and saw him there and we talked and i got the nerve up to call every one in the phone book with his last name to get his #.  balls baby...nothin but balls! anyway this was last monday the 29th.  weve spent almost every day together since.  hes a nice guy and he cleans and compliments me and wow...maybe itll go somewhere.  for now ""it is what it is"".  tty soon! gotta get back to my wonderful job!

i find out this week if i got that other job.  I pray that i did.  I already know what im doing, so they don't have to train me.  I think i was the only ""internal"" interview they had.  I also think they give priority to people already ""inside"" Sandhills Center.  I pray i pray i pray!!

Mostly because I am just now going to be around more people that just the ones I work with.  I used to be such an optimistic person.  I will be again soon.  There is no reason why I can't stick to my values and my opinions and the way I feel about things and not be happy.  I'm gonna be happy damnit.  If it kills me.  I have nothing to complain about.

My best friend Kara flew into Raleigh last thursday for my 21st birthday on the 27th! We went to Myrtle Beach and i had my first legal drink at a little place called Dirty Don's Oyster Bar.  WOW! i had no clue fried oysters were sooo good.  So anyway we play around in the waves a little bit, drink in the hotel pool, yell at guys off the balcony(again, while drinkin)  it was great!  i drank a whole pitcher of margaritas by myself then went back to the room and had two daquiris and another 'rita. it was great! then my other best friend Adam came in this past wednesday and stayed til this am.  we had alot of fun.  im so glad he came to visit me.  we caught up on old times.  had a few of our ""talks"".  jus good stuff.  ill be down next weekend but he'll be back at school doin the band thing before the season starts.  and to those fuckers who decided that colonel rebel wasnt good enough for ole miss.....fuck u!  yeah so anyway this was possibly the best 8 days ive ever spent in my whole entire life.  for once in my life, everything i wanted i got. including sunshine on my bday in this rainy ass state.  it was wonderful! k im leaving for now!!"

"event","Yeah so I haven't updated in quite some time.  I know I know! Like so many other ppl, it seems I only write when im upset and distraught.  A few nights ago while playin with my dog, my brother noticed something protruding from his skin.  I looked at it and i knew right away it couldnt be good so i called the vet to make an appt.  Took him this morning.  I found out he has leukemia.  That ""protruding thing"" thats the size of a softball is a tumor that is encompassing the majority of his pelvic area and is very inoperable.  He also has heart worms, but these are the least of our worries.  If the tumor grows anymore( and im sure it will) it will cover up his whole backside...in other words he wont be able to use the bathroom.  I know other ppl have it bad too, but this dying stuff just isnt sitting too well with me.  On a brighter note, the doc said she couldnt believe how well hes actin considering.  We even went for a walk and he was runnin so he must not be in THAT much pain.  WE have prednisone for inflammation which is what we're hoping is causin the size of the tumor to be so big.  Keep us in your prayers and ull be in ours."

I still can't sleep that well, but I went to the doctor yesterday and he gave me some medicine.  I've yet to take it though, he says its addictive.  He also gave me darvocet for my headaches.  Momma is doin better.  She has her moments, but for the most part shes alright.  She used to call maw maw every night while she cooked supper and she went to dial her # the other night and realized what she was doing and started crying, but other than stuff like that i think she's doing good.  My aunts call her all the time and she calls them too.  They're all tryin to fill a huge void and i think theyre doin a good job.  
I was supposed to be in the mountains of Virginia right now but, well, im not.  I wanna spend time with my family.  I think we're goin to Durham this weekend to a new mall and to some pottery place.  Then sunday we're goin to fort bragg for some kinda air show like the one they have at Columbus air force base every summer.

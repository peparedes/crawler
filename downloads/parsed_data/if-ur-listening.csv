"event","<b>Oct 14</b> | fun day! the plan was to go to the dal open house with dan. well we couldn't even find the place.. yeah. so we skipped off the rest of the day! sneaky. drove around for a bit, visited value village and dan stole a shirt lol.. badass. parked for a bit in portland estates and the headed back to school for a bit.

<b>Oct 15</b> | went to geoff's graduation at dal for 2pm. he got his bachelor of computer science! the grad was very well done, gowns looked funny. was introduced to all the ""suits"" at the reception.. pretty boring. most of them being professors or deans. same question over and over again, ""what do you plan to do after high school?"" ... <big>i don't know!</big>
mom and geoff went out to dinner, and i went to mario's to work on sociology paper. didn't really work on it too much, just ate food and looked at pictures of his europe trip. very funny stories.

<b>Oct 16</b> | got up, showered, packed for dad's. worked 12-5. did homework for the rest of the night. where is my life?

<b>Oct 17</b> | busy bee.
forgot my math binder and failed to catch up on homework. so far, mark is 75%. better than usual.
sociology was a bore, all he did was talk. i have to admit, it was pretty interesting at first, but i'm not that interested in learning about how tylenol or ibuprofin works. mid-term test tomorrow.
walked around with dan at lunch, and switched lockers <i>thank god</i>. but he was sick and went home right after lunch lol.
tried to do math in off class but just don't get it.
passed in project for entrepreneurship. i signed up for entrepreneurship just so i could do this <i>business for a day</i> project and now i can't even do it thanks to this alberta trip which i'm not even excited for.
volleyball practice after school, pretty much fooled around."

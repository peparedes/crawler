"event","I guess you could say I'm a lot better than I was. The lonliness has passed and I feel fulfilled again -- slowly but surely my life is making sense again.

And THEN my best friend's ex of about a MONTH declares his love for me.

HELLO!

I freaked out. I really did. I was a nervous wreck for three straight days. And then I prayed about it -- HARD -- and I realized that even though he was offering me this perfect fairytale love, I knew it was fake and NOT what I needed. I turned down his offer and heaved a sigh of relief.

Today in Bible class, while listening to worship music and reading my Bible, I felt like my heart would just BURST with love for God. It was awesome!!!

So, in short, God is my love and I want to be His beloved until I finally get to meet Him and after.

<P>Yes, I'm going to go all serious on you. Last night was really helpful. Time was about 8:20; I was sitting there against my wall, and I had ""Strong Enough"" by Stacie Orrico playing loudly on my stereo. Tears were just streaming down my face, and I was heaving sobs. (Something I've held in for a long time now.) And my mom comes in (dun, dun, dunnn) and she demands to know what's wrong with me. So of course I start talking all over myself trying to insist that it's nothing I could explain. But she didn't leave me there, she just asked again and I let it out. She told me that I was just being too hard on myself, and that I really was fighting with myself, and that just because I'm a Christian doesn't mean it's weird to wanna be loved. I felt so much better! Cuz this whole time I thought I was horrible for wanting that kind of attention. I &lt;3 my mom, haha, I'm not ashamed to say it.

Today was FUN!

Abbi had Megan over (oh boy, two six year old girls, right?) and so Dad took Ben and I to the mall. Well, not the mall first. But we DID go. Here is our list of destinations...

1- The Tractor Place (aka - I dont know the name)
2- Mister Jeremy's house (aka Butternut's House)
3- Lowe's
4- the bank
5- the Mall (which consisted of...
[a] Sears
[b] the bathrooms (lol)
[c] Claire's/EB
[d] Waldenbooks
[e] Pretzels Plus)
6- Mister Jeremy's again
7- Greenie's Car Wash
8- Home:-)

It was pretty freakin' fun! Instead of the laptop (i know, *gasp*) I got $100, which is still fun for me. I like my computer and I don't really need a new one. Maybe next year, or next semester. Dad will still want a new computer by then... ;-) I'll probably end up regretting it. But oh well, too friggin late now. Hah.

Ben and I got into a loud, screaming fight before we left, though. It started with him taking my CD without asking, and then Dad left to go somewhere and Ben was all upset cuz he thought we weren't getting the weight system today (he's been SUCH a p.i.b about that...) and I told him flat out, we all get dissappointed. And of course Mom says ""Dani doesn't have a boyfriend,"" making a point that THAT is why i'm disappointed. Which was true. So I wasn't upset at her, but then BEN says.. ""It's her fault she doesn't have a boyfriend,"" and he started to bring up all this nasty crap about me like being immature and being asked before (which is a lie) and all this other stupid stuff. I was NOOOOT a happy person. :bitter: But I guess we're okay now.

Ahhhhh. I don't know. I'm all moody and bleh still. Stuff does not fill you up. Not even three of the freakin' coolest pairs of earrings, a starry thumbring, a glittery pink notebook (complete with pink fuzzy pen!), a ""you suck and that's sad"" sticker, a new Bible, 2 AG books and a cute bookmark. Heh.

"event","Crafted in His Image


By Daniel Arnold
PPPFUA Admin.
The Story of A Statue


 

The statue stood tall and proud, radiant and shining.  Upon its base read the words, ""Chosen One.""  Constructed of the finest materials crafted by its maker, the figure waited anxiously for the day of his unveiling, standing idly by in the storage room next to the showcase.  He dreamed of the day he would be placed outside in a location of importance to the maker's work.

Then he would live with purpose, he thought.  So for the moment, the hour, the year, he would just rest, maintaining himself-- waiting for his maker to put him to use.

Years went by and before too long the stone found itself among the basement rubble.  He could call out, but he believed no one would listen.  As he was seemingly forgotten, the temperature plunged in the cellar and museum ""junk"" was piled upon him.  ""Who am I?,"" cried the statue and he weeped in self-pity as cracks formed upon his breast and brow.  I will not reveal the gaps and flaws within myself or else I will never be used.  With that, he applied a thin layer of wax upon his innards to maintain appearances.  All the while hating himself within and denying the beauty of his creation, the ancient statue wished to be demolished.  

""Cursed be my stone creation.  How I long to end the hypocrisy and burst into the dust from which I was crafted.""  With that, another crack, deep within his core chest cavity formed, unseen by the naked eye.  Stoically he shed the tears, but remained motionless.  Thinking, ""Why has my maker forsaken me?  Why do I exist if this is all I can be?  Wretched am I!""  

""Arise my child,"" he heard in the distance, as a light shimmered to penetrate the darkness, radiating heat to cast aside the cold.""

Under his breath he scowled, ""You have left me and that I deserve.  I am worthless and have fallen to pieces.  How can a stone rubble be called your child?""  

""Step into the light my son.""

He could not resist.  His sullen body deteriorated, what was left of the chest cavity longing for the heat, the light, the care for reasons he knew not.  However painful in adjustment to light, nothing could be worse than the current state of neglect.

Even though the stoicism filled him, inwardly a pulse was beating, a trust rejuvenating no matter how ancient its origin.  Unable to move, he cried and the maker's pallet carried him forward with the grasp of workers of the museum. 

""You are broken.  You are now worthy to be utilized because I made you to be so.""

At that moment, the radiant light melted away the wax and the statue fell into pieces.  Immediately, the stone sculpture thought himself to be deceived.  He longed to evaporate, but heart-wrenching words were spoken.

""Oh your little faith, your little trust.  I made you, constructed you, carved you from the dusts of this earth. Can I not restore you?""

""But look at me father!  Why bother?  I am a mess.""  

""Look at me.""  

Energy within from the maker's mechanism gave the stone the ability to look and he discovered a face after his own.

""Carry me!""

With a smile, the creator placed the tiny stone fragments in a wheelbarrow and brought them to his shop.  The frightening hammer and chisel awaited.

""How do you aim to fix me with that instrument of destruction?""

Tenderly, mercifully, patiently, the maker assured the stone in the stone's moment of doubt that he had unforseen abilities to restore and destroy the faults that would further develop.  ""Little by little, I will craft you into my definition of beauty.""

Each step accepting the next crashing penetration with faith sometimes strong, sometimes weak, sometimes desperate, he surrendered though begging for rest.

""As much as you need you will receive.  I know my chisel.  I know every aspect of your tension points, and I know you will let me have my will.""  

In the blink of an eye, the maker transported the pieces out into the museum which would ultimately enter the outside world.

""Where are you taking me?  I am hideous.""

""You are beautiful.  My creation of you is made perfect in your weakness.  Your defects prove that my radiance shines through you beyond your fault lines.""

""But I will be ridiculed, I will be scorned and outcasted.  Visitors will spit on me and call me a liar.  My past times of deterioration and anything in the future will show right through.""  

""I am perfect, declared the maker.""

""Why of course you are; what's your point?""

""You will reflect me.""

With that, the maker removed his outer garments to reveal tears scattered all about his figure and holes in his hands and feet. 

""Without inward deterioration, I became this way for you.  It is now time that you authentically serve your purpose my child.  Let me display myself through you.""

Make this ride as fast as I can
Tonight this road home feels a little longer
I hope you know that you were my best friend
Tonight I said goodbye, but I should have said more
Thanks for the best time of my life.
Come home, now that you're gone I've finally realized
That you were the best
Come home, I won't forget the times that we had
I'm wishing that you weren't a part of my past
Emptiness swallows this town
From now on I will be alone for good
Will you remember my name?
I'm hoping that I will hear from you soon
Thank you for everything
Come home, now that you're gone I've finally realized
That you were the best
Come home, I won't forget the times that we had
So please don't be a part of my past

"event","I decided today that I am taking charge over my life. No more spending hours on the internet. It doesn't help me at all.

My writing talents will not be curbed. I'll just lessen the focus on doing nothing but sitting on my butt in a computer chair. I have a talent, but it is also wasted if I just hang around doing nothing while my life passes me by.

Once my next ""friend"" is gone, I'm going to start exercising regularly. I need to let my body get healthy (let this virusy thing pass with my PMS) before I can shock it into its new reality. I can never starve myself, that's just crazy talk. But I'm sticking to three square meals and cutting out snacking. Not completely, of course. Especially not when my gurls come over for a sleepover. Then, I'm allowed to pig out. But not before or after that. When I'm PMSing, I think I'll just do something constructive instead of buying into the snack cravings. Which brings me to guitar lessons.

Once I'm 'better', Mom and Dad are discussing the taking up of lessons, because I'm excited about the guitar. It's kinda in my blood, since Mom plays piano (I tried that, and it's not my forte) and Dad plays guitar and bass. Ben has drums and Abbi's only 6 yet. I don't want to be a musical outcast. Yes, I can sing, but I want to PLAY. I want to do more than <i>rhyme</i> my feelings. I long to be able to express my emotions with MUSIC and writing. And I am so excited about it.

God has to become first. Too long I've let other things come between He and I. And that's pointless, when my life will improve (and become harder) once I fall in love with Him completely. More devotional time, more focus on worship instead of hollow music and such. I'm gonna do it, too.

My grades will improve when I focus more on homework and studying. That's my job right now, as well as keeping my weight around the house. Which means - sigh - I'll have to watch how messy my room gets and whatnot, and do more laundry. But I'm out to improve my life, and not let it slip by while I lay around like a blob of nothingness.

Which brings me back to my weight. It's definitely not at a safe place. It makes me sleepier than I should be, except when I SHOULD be sleepy. I should probably get to bed earlier too. And I'm really tired of saying ""I should I should"". I'm going to. Summer's coming up, and I would love to have the feeling of being unashamed in a bathing suit. I'm tired of looking at myself as less than I am because I'm not very thin. I don't expect to become a supermodel of course. I just want to be a healty, happy weight. So I can look at myself in the mirror and say ""Hey Gorgeous, look what you've done with what God's given you."" My body is a temple. It shouldn't be forced to be less than potential.

<b>I shouldn't allow myself to become less than my highest possible potential.</b>

So here I am, totally ready to make a new start. I'm shedding my skin with wintertime. And I'll be a new creation by summer. 

I need lots and lots of your prayer --- I hope you can help me out that way. God'll hear us. =)

Thanx ya. ;)

That about sums up the past entire DAY. I wanted to stay home but I wasn't sick enough. Puh. 

That's why I couldn't concentrate in any class, said all but 20 words during lunch, and almost nodded off all through Geometry. (That class itself is snoresville, but being sick didn't help at ALL.) 

I came home today around 3-something and fell right asleep. Slept till 6:30, and ate ""dinner"" (Berry Berry Kix) before coming downstairs to get online.

""I used to like you, but it just .. stopped."" I SWEAR if I hear it one more time, I'm moving to England and leaving everything behind. I'll move in with Stacey. I'm sure her parents wouldn't mind. Heh.

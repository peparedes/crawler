"event","this weekend was decent. friday, louise&clint, natalie&duck, heath, wes&kalen, joe&kasey, and me, went to see 'saw' but ended up going to the incredibles,  because not everyone was 17. it was pretty good. 

saturday, went to the portfolio review in atlanta... extremely stressful. i did, however, get very helpful feedback. i want to look into going to rhode island school of design... or possibly auburn. i want to feel like i've actually gotten somewhere in my college search. i've only narrowed it down to about 3847 schools.

last night i had a dream about skateboarding so james is teaching me. i 'skated' for 2 and a half hours. not sure what kind of progress i made, but i'm trying. tonight is the  <strong>Nickelodeon Cartoon Film Festival</strong>  so i'm completely stoked. natalie's having a masquerade [sp??] ball for her birthday. SUCH a rockin idea. xox"

i think my mother is moving away without me. to myrtle beach. which is far away. and i am not going. national portfolio day is at the atlanta college of art on nov 6. we are taking a car pool. i'm sikkkkkked. also, going to visit SCAD on october 8.

tonight dad taught me how to stain wood. i laughed at james for having ghetto door handles and i think i jinxed myself because now mine looks the same as his. the door opens by pulling a wire. ew. </center>"

james took me to upstart fest (pt. 2). we arrived at about 1:30. i brought a can of chef boy-r-dee (sp??) and a plastic fork so i wouldn't have to buy food. the first couple bands were okay. (futureheads, delays, the whigs) then we got in line to meet franz ferdinand. i was sooo nervous. after like an hour and some odd minutes... i got them to sign my shirt and a card for mallory. i just said hi and thank you. they were all very quiet. until i got to the last guy... nicholas (guitar/keyboard/some vocals). he made a little conversation about the card and how it was from their last tour. then i said ""can i hug you????"" he just laughed at me and said yes. some guy was taking pictures of me being a groupie. ha. watched the scissor sisters next... awesome flaming homosexual 80's-sounding dance music. watched the killers.
<font color=violet>**************************************************</font>
then last of course was franz. james helped me fight my way nearly to the front. we waiting patiently in the mass of body heat and sweat thro for about another hour until they came on. i screamed my lungs out and sang the whole time. it was the most amazing time of my life. boyfriends are not so bad. nether is life. <3 xoxoxox

i had the weirdest dream the other night. it was like i lived on this huge... colony in the forest. everything was larger than life... it was almost like i was a tiny little fairy that lived in the grass. all these other people were there and there was a humongous tree. the tree was almost like a central 'brain' that made decisions for everyone. it was like no one knew what free will was or even cared to know. i kept trying to tell everyone but no one would listen. then i fell in love with a man with dark hair and dark eyes. he was from somewhere far away and beautiful. that's all i remember. xoxox"

last night, my brother, my dad and i all went to these tiny redneck races. i wasn't aware that florida had an area like habersham. it was so awesome. i'm going next saturday to watch the school bus figure 8's. mwahaha.

i hear louise has a boyfriend which is sofreakincool. ryan is loving his new job. ray is off to summer camp. court and i have made amends. i am ready to be home. 2 weeks down, 3 to go."

Thank god dad's being understanding. he's only making me pay $500. if it was fixed with my insurance that would be the deductable. 6:00pm i went to graphic design class and got slapped in the face with 2 more projects in addition to my 1 in progect. did get an a on the other one though. 9:00pm i headed to clearwater. the way the condos work, it's easiest to walk through an alley way to the other side of the building. tonight was the first time i did it at night. i think for sure i tripped on a severed limb in the dark. i didn't slow down to look back. i came to the net cafe in hopes that time would be wasted more interrestingly. i need <font size=1><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=tearsofvelvet"">hugs</a></font>. **hello teacher tell me what's my lesson? look right through me, look right through me. i find it kinda funny, i find it kinda sad. the dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had**"

'drive all night, to hold you tight, back to california. days went by, we waited and i guess we're getting older. we couldn't win in the end. you're gone.' i just had one of the most refreshing showers i have ever had in my life. after the drive to fort myers and back (approx. 2 h each way) and the driving all over town, i could probably season food with the amount of sweat residue on my body. regardless it was so discusting. i kno i smelled like butt... he smelled nice, too. i met greg and michael as well. interresting characters those 2 are, the like 15 minutes i actually spent around them (playing video games not counted). i feel so different. like emotion just took a steaming shit on my face. i keep thinking about the future. and the past. *sigh* ahhh make it stop. so it goes. i wish gas wasn't so expensive. i would drive forever. 'waking up all alone, sending postcards back to home, from the road.' work at 7 am tomorrow."

AND i've got more than 75 cents in my checking account. i need to take a hiatus more often. i think i was trying waaay to hard to be happy, rather than just letting things be. thank god i finally opened my eyes. or closed them rather... not sure. is this a sign that everything good's happening just so it can be shitty? am i lying to myself again? yummy, i don't care. i'm happy. kisses for all. <3."

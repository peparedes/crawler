Anyways, then I went home and had to come back and pick up my sister from her hair appt.  then she freaked out on me saying she needed to go to the mall but I did not have time to drive her there because I had already had plans through out the whole day and was already late, so she called my parents blah blah blah lots of drama, then I eventually ended up with the car.

I went to alex's and his dad said we had to leave because he was leaving and we had no where to go so we went downtown stillwater and went to tremblays to see if they were still hiring because I am still looking for a job but ya.... they werent so that kinda sucked... then we left downtown and went back to his hosue to figure out where to go.....

""Tiger Lily""

we drive tonight,
and you are by my side.
We're talking about our lives,
like we've known each other forever.
the time flies by,
with the sound of your voice.
its close to paradise,
with the end surely near.
and if i could only stop the car
and hold onto you,
and never let go (and never let go)
i'll never let go (i'll never let go)
as we round the corner
to your house
you turned to me and said,
""i'll be going through withdrawl of you 
for this one night we have spent.""
and, i want to speak these words
but i guess i'll just bite my tongue,
and accept ""someday, somehow""
as the words that we'll hang from.

and i (i..), i don't want to speak these words.

why does tonight, have to end?
why don't we hit restart,
and pause it at our favorite parts.
we'll skip the goodbyes.
if i had it my way,
i'd turn the car around and runaway,
just you and i.

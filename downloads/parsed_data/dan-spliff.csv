"event","I'm not very good at writing my feelings but I'll just put events here, so far this weekend has been wierd.
+ I went to the cinema with Roose & Gordan, we cruised there in Gordans car, its really wierd having a mate driving, made me feel all growned up =D
- I ran for the first time in 3 years & I fell over my baggy assed trousers and slid accross the concrete, now I'm bruised & sore & have gashed my knee & elbow =(
+ I played xbox live @ gordans. I want broadband so I can play Tenchu online with him.

Watched The Last Of The Samarai last night, its bloody good, one of the best films Tom Cruise has ever done - its close between that and Vanilla Sky which I also loved.

Discovered a new band who I like called Sigor Ross, thank you Jak.

anyways I'll write more on this thing another time, should be intresting to look back on in a few years time."

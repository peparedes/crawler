I write this to say that perhaps it's time I used them more often. There are plenty of things in my life that have exclamation points on them, but I just don't seem to use them when I write. I know I speak with exclamation a lot, so perhaps I need to learn to further my ""vocabulary"" and put exclamation in my writting.

Or...

Maybe I'm just a dull writer. I haven't actually written anything in a while and when I do write it tends to be of a very nerdy nature. Almost always it's a backstory for a character I, or a friend of mine, is playing or some sort of nerdity that has to do with gaming in general. I don't often write to just write.

And when I do write and it doesn't have anything to do with nerdiness, it often has something to do with a woman and how I fell about her. A couple years ago a woman encited an exclamation point from me in my writing, but that didn't work out quite well, though she and I are still on good speaking terms. I would say that there is someone around now that would encite the same thing, but I'm not sure it's gotten that far yet and I'm not sure I want it to get that far any time soon, since she's in a relationship and completely unavailable.

In conclusion, because I love that phrase, I say that maybe I should write more about things that mean something to me. Maybe I should take the things I actually care about and make them important enough to write about. Maybe more writing would make me better at typing and other things. It seems like just not I'm finally getting back to a good WPM in my typing skills and that's only when I'm fully focused on what's streaming from my brain.

Either way, more exclamation points, not less."

Now that I have that out of the way.

The last two weeks of school have been fantastic. No, wait, Fan FREAKING tastic. I love my school. I love the classes. I love the teachers. I love that I am actually learning things I need for my degree (or certificate). I love that I put some effort into class and I have ""As"" in all of them. I just got transfered for two days a week to a different store at work that will make this even better. Life is wonderful.

I'm meeting all kinds of people. I personally am a loner. I don't interact with people, but I do speak up in class a lot. I have been interacting a lot with people and the girls (and they ARE mostly women) are actually treating me pretty well. Let me tell you, this is great.

So, I met a couple of gamer girls. One named Suzi, and the other named Jenna. Jenna is super hot, and smart, and funny. She's seriously fantastic, but I doubt I would date her at all. Nothing against her, but I don't know if our personalities would work out together. Either way, she's really nice. Most of the women are. I haven't had much in the way of trouble, except for a couple of instances. Either way, I have found school so utterly amazing that it would take a lot for it to be bad.

Also, there is another girl named Rebecca. She's in my A&P class and my intro to massage class. She's beautiful. One of those beauties I can't get out of my head. (Much like a certain Jiffy, but shorter). She's really nice, and when we have talked, she seems rather mature. Who knows.

Either way, none of this will matter right now. I need to focus on school (which is awesome) and focus on work (Which pays me) and spend my time with a fantastic little man."

What I am not happy with is my decisions. I needed to stay out of the situation I am in. That didn't happen and now I have to figure out what I am going to do with it.

Along those same lines, I really appreciate it when some one who doesn't know me and hears my situation for the first time reacts in a very kind, very selfless way. To do that shows me a heart of love, and to be honest, that's nice to see.

I've been as vague here as possible, because I just don't have it in me to be overly open with what is going on. I don't feel like opening up completely and hurting anyone right now. Maybe in a couple of days I can explain it all."

(As presented in Thomas Cahill's ""How the Irish Saved Civilization"")

I arise today
Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity
Through a belief in the threeness,
Through confessions of the oneness
Of the Creator of Creation

I arise today
Through the strength of Christ's birth with his baptism,
Through the strength of his crucifixion with his burial,
Through the strength of his resurrection with his ascension,
Through the strength of his descent for the judgement of Doom.

I arise today
Through the strength of the love of cherubim,
In obedience of Angels,
In the service of Archangels,
In hope of resurrection to meet with reward,
In preayers of patriarchs,
In predictions of prophets,
In preachings of apostles,
In faith of confessors,
In innocence of holy virgins,
In deeds of righteous men.

I arise today
Through the strength of heaven:
Light of sun,
Radiance of moon,
Splendor of fire,
Speed of lightning,
Swiftness of wind,
Depth of Sea, 
Stability of earth,
Firmness of rock.

I arise today
Through God's strength to pilot me:
God's might to uphold me,
God's wisdom to guide me,
God's eye to look before me,
God's ear to hear me,
God's word to speak for me,
God's hand to guard me,
God's way to lie before me,
God's shield to protect me,
God's host to save me
From snares of devils,
From temptation of vices,
From everyone who shall wish me ill,
Afar and anear,
Alone in multitude.

I summon today these powers between me and those evils,
Against every cruel, merciless power that may oppose my body and soul,
Against incantaions of false prophets,
Against black laws of pagandom,
Against false laws of heretics,
Against crafts of idolatry,
Agains spells of witches and smiths and wisards,
Against every knowledge that corrupts man's body and soul.

Christ shield me today
Against poison, against burning,
Against drowning, against wounding,
so that there may come to me abundance of reward,
Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me,
Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me,
Christ on my right, Christ on my left,
Christ when I lie down, Christ when I sit down, Christ when I arise,
Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,
Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,
Christ in every eye that sees me,
Christ in every ear that hears me.

I arise today
Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,
Through the belief in the threeness,
Through the confession of the oneness,
Of the Creator of creation.

I felt odd tonight (may have been last night). Dave and I were talking, and he said something that just made my stomach tighten. I wasn't sure how to react. We talked about it, and I realized a little bit of why, but I still don't fully understand it.

I really enjoy being sure of things. I also really like it when people around me understand me. And when they agree with what I feel. It's almost like it validates my feelings. It's good to hear validation every once in a while.

I have kept this vague for a couple of reasons. I don't mean to keep anyone out of my inner thoughts, but I just don't feel like this is the best place to become so very open.

I enjoy atmosphere. 4th Street is awesome for that very reason. I enjoy sitting and shooting the shit. It's good stuff. I like when people get me, and my humor. It's refreshing to know that I can act like a goof, or really serious with people and they will react appropriately.

I like the fact that even though the pirate joke is horrible, it's still funny. Just like the Butt Baron. I like that I have inside jokes with others. I like that I break my intimacy barriers on a regular basis. I like that I have friends I can trust that allow me to do that with out fear.

I love the fact that God put people in my life that allow me to be. I love that he taught me some hard lessons in a lot of difficult situations. I love that even though I sin, he never turns his back on me. Even when I turn my back on him.

I love friends that just get me. Who I am, where I am, what I feel. They may not always understand 100%, but they do care enough to listen and get the entire picture. Listening is a very good friend quality.

I have a lot of things I could be upset by. Things that could tear me down and make me feel like crap. I chose to not let that happen. Sure, bad things have happened, and are likely to happen in the future. But God's plan cannot be stopped by bad things. In the end God wins, and I win because of His mercy and grace. That realization helps me smile every day.

My son is amazing. So bright and smart and funny and just plain beautiful. He is the center of what I plan for. He is the future I look forward to. I have not always been the best father, but I continually work to make that change. Just like a lot of other things."

I know that I care, but not nealy enough to sit and watch John Edwards make an ass out of himself. I can't believe that the government was so slow to respond, but at the same time, so what? Grrrrrr....

So anyway..... Politics, though fun to learn about are annoying. I hate the idea that I can make a difference by voting, and yet it doesn't really work that way. I voted for Mitch Daniels. I HATE the idea of daylight savings. And Mitch decided that he liked it and poof. That's the way it was. That's a bunch of crap. I think daylight savings is the biggest crock of crap ever.

Could catch my eye,
Then life was new and every new day,
I thought that I could fly.
I believed in what I hoped for,
And I hoped for things unseen,
I had wings and dreams could soar,
I just don't feel like flying anymore.
When the stars threw down their spears,
Watered Heaven with their tears,
Before words were spoken,
Before eternity.

Dear Father, I need you,
Your strength my heart to mend.
I want to fly higher,
Every new day again.

When I was small, the furthest I could reach,
Was not so high,
Then I thought the world was so much smaller,
Feeling that I could fly.
Through distant deeps and skies,
Behind infinity,
Below the face of Heaven,
He stoops to create me.

Dear Father, I need you,
Your strength my heart to mend.

Mankind versus me.
The struggles go on,
The wisdom I lack,
The burdens keep pilling
Up on my back.
So hard to breathe,

The mountain is high,
I wait in the depths.
Yearning for grace,
And hoping for peace.

Healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again.

Next, who ever comes up with these ideas have no legal knowledge or any common sense, or they would know that you can't just make up a petition to make the government lower prices.

I mean other than the fact that I have 6 email addresses and could make up names for each of them, no one is on the end of the line of idiots signing them to collect the names.

I have participated in both the ""one day gas strikes"". Not by some need to protest, more like I just didn't need gas that day. You want to protest? Quit driving your car. Stop being and idiot.

So I got another email last night from the same guy. It basically said ""I know you wrote me a reply, but I am too high and mighty to read it. You are wrong, I am right, give me my money."" What a dickhole. The more I get angry about this the more vulgar I have been.

My parents are going out of town again soon. I'm not sure when, because when they mentioned it I really wasn't paying attention. It's not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't care. I like having whole weekends to my self, it's nice.

This sunday is my birthday. I expect to have hundreds of dollars delivered to me by strippers. That would be awesome. Of course the reality is that I expect to go out with my family to eat at the best Italian place ever. BUCA DI BEPPO. YAY!! I love Buca, it makes my tummy happy."

So I get to work this morning and I have this email waiting for me. It's from my old room mate about the money I owe him. Little back story. I lost my job at the end of May and I didn't find another job until the end of June. I was unemployeed for a month, so of course my bills were off. I caught up the best I could until the last couple weeks of July when I moved into my parents house because A) I didn't want to live in the blazing hot hell hole I did anymore. I had continually asked Doug to call the land lord and get her to fix the AC and his response was ""yeah I know"". A lot more to that too. B) I couldn't afford to live there with the child support I had to pay. C) It really wasn't working out the way I wanted it to, and Doug hadn't paid rent almost the entire time I lived there. So I talked to Doug about me moving and I even told him that I would be willing to pay for part of August, even though I wouldn't be living there. Did I mention that he didn't have a job. He lost his job in the middle of June, so he was hard up for cash until he got a job 2 or 3 weeks ago. So I knew I owed Doug money, but not as much as he would like to believe. I owe him for the utilities for July and some food he claims I ate. He then posts a note on the fridge where I don't live that I owe him $730 for August and for a bill I haven't paid at a store. He didn't, to my knowledge, pay the bill either, but he wants the money so he doesn't have to get a better paying job. He was supposed to have a room mate move in at the beginning of september, but the guy couldn't and so I didn't go and get the rest of my stuff that I don't have a place for. Doesn't matter that I have my son monday through friday and every other weekend. Doesn't matter that Doug didn't say ""hey I really need money"" when I had money. Doesn't matter the I am working hard to scrap by right now. No what matters is Doug. He is a selfish jack ass and I hate it. He sends me an email and says that I can't have any of my things back until I pay him $730. Riiiiiight. I will be getting my stuff this week, I don't care if I have to call the police to get it. I can't believe that he would do something like this. He acts like I put him out by not paying him, and I will admit I owe him almost $200. The problem is that he owes a bunch of people thousands of dollars and he's trying to tell me that I'm not being a good friend to him by not paying him back. FUCK HIM. Sorry about the language, but this pisses me off. I know I need to pay him. Hell I know that he is hard up for money, but somehow it turns back on me and becomes my fault that he quit a job because he didn't want to work there. It becomes my fault that even though I was paying him EVERY month on time until July he still is behind on rent for almost an entire year. I moved in in February. I didn't cause him to not pay before that. He had money from me every month, and yet he refused to pay rent while I lived there. I mean seriously, he used my car for almost the entire time I lived there to get to work. I got a ride every day, not him. I really comes down to him wanting money and not having to work for it. I will admit that I don't work at my job. I haven't since I started. I also have a job and short of the $200 the he told me was no big deal to pay whenever I have paid every bill I have on time and I have had a little money to scrap by on. Yes I went out a bought a movie. Heck I bought a book too. But I didn't go blow hundreds of dollars at all kinds of places just to spite him. I can't believe this. I am better now, but really what the heck is he thinking? I can't believe that he would be such a prick as to put our friendship on the line like this. Did I mention that he has had this issue for some time now and never said anything. I called him last monday and he said he needed to talk to me. He was at my house saturday. I went over to his house last night. How difficult is it to talk to some one? I have made myself availible to him and he's a prick. I am sick and tired of him being this way and I don't think that I can put myself into the situation of being a close friend of his anymore."

So I find myself wondering today why bankruptcy costs so much. I mean I understand what it does for you, but really it does nothing. I recently had so dealings with bankruptcy and have come to the realization that no matter how much money I owe on something that is rightfully owed, I will never declare bunkruptcy. I mean really, if I went to the hospital why shouldn't I pay? If I bought a car and stopped paying on it, why shouldn't I pay? The beauty is that some people don't understand that they have to pay for the things they want in their life. How hard is that to understand? If you buy a car because you ""have"" to have it, why can't you pay for it? If you get sick and pass out a lot and go to the hospital, why can't you pay for that? If you spend Chistmas money instead of paying for presents and you have to beg your mom for money, why can't you pay for that? If you decide to move into an apartment with NO prior planning and need to borrow money, why can't you pay for that. Some of these you should be paying half of, but the reality is that some people don't pay anything on any of their bills and others get blamed for it. My favorite is when you are in the middle of a divorce and their is a court order for you to pay for something and you don't. Of course on top of that you can always blame it on your soon to be ex and say that it's all his fault. Of course on top of that you could also live with you mother who pays for everything you need. Of course on top of that you could refuse to take care of your son, just like you have the entire time you've been a mother. But I speak of hypotheticals.


In other news. My parents are going out of town this weekend. Last time my father went out of town, two weeks ago, someone tried to break in the house. I find it odd that some one would wait until he isn't home and then decide to break in. So in the fear of it happening again, I have decided to carry the fire poker with me all weekend. If I so much as hear an unfamiliar twig snap outside I'm going to hurt something. I really don't like the feeling of not being safe, so I will have to fix that by beating things. I think that is a fair solution. What really bothers me out of this whole thing is that I think some one was trying to scare us. I know why they would, but I don't know how this would change anything. The only thing it will change is how fast I call the police and run outside looking for some one to hit. I hope they play smart and atleast run faster than a overweight, out of shape slacker. Of course adrenaline makes up for a lot.

So lately I have been frequenting this dating website. I found this awesome girl who is into things that I am. Horrible geeky things like I am. Its great. I contacted her and got a response, but she quit talking to me after I mentioned my son. I was saddened by this, until I realized that this is the way things are going to go. I will always be a single father with my son living at home. I will always have to go through life with women not wanting anything to do with me because of that. Its not like I'm Casanova anyway, so this will make it harder for me to find something meaningful. Of course at the same time this also means that I don't have to work hard to screen women either. They can't deal with the fact that I have a son, see ya. I would rather not date than date someone who can't accept my role as a father. I can't wait for this divorce to be over. I refuse to cheat on my wife so I haven't really put forth an effort to date. I'm hoping that maybe one day I can move past the issues she brought up in me and move on to a happier life. Lately I haven't been very angry about the divorce so much as angry because she refuses to do what she is supposed to. I really wish my son could have a real mother that was there for him like she should be, but until some growing up and maturing happens this is the way it is."

Quick! Somebody punch me in the face so I can forget about my divorce.

Yeah like that works.

What is the deal with gas. Until it hit $2.85 I didn't worry about it. I let it slide. Inflation and stupid things happen. Now it has hit a mark somewhere inside me. I went from ""meh, what can you do?"" to ""it's revolution time."" How does that work? I really like driving. It's one of my most favorite pass times. And yet somehow we have to pay almost $3.00 a gallon. Like I can afford that. The economy is eventually going to take a hit when people just can't afford to go on vacation. This is rediculous."

When you read the things that I do, this tends to be a much bigger deal than it seems. I heard death threats, serious ones at that, when someone tried to talk to me about the book. Sad isn't it.


On a completely different note. A friend of mine is going through a rough spot. I spent quite a bit of time on the phone with her last night. I really enjoyed talking with her, and I only wish there was something more I could have done to make her feel better about the idiots in her life."

"event","Why is it that the service expectations for every worker on the planet have gone down. I have been to restaurants where on a SLOW night with extra servers standing around I had to wait 25 minutes for a piece of cheese cake. I went to McDonalds last night and ordered $20 worth of food, and had to ask the girl to repeat it back to me. I went to a bar recently, again on a slow night, and had to practically beg the bartender to stop yacking with the waitress and get me a coke. I mean seriously. When I worked fast food I remember days where I don't know where the time went because I was ALWAYS doing something. I know for a fact that we had an expectation to keep the customers happy. A friend of mine went to the theatre and had issues with 8 year olds watching an R rated movie WITHOUT their parents. She said something to the manager, whose response was basically ""not my problem"". I remember when I couldn't get into pg13 movies without my parent being there with me and watching the movie with me. What do you mean ""not my problem""? How is it not your problem. THEY'RE 8. Seriously. What happened?

In addition. Back in my day, we delivered pizza on time. And if it wasn't on time, we gave a discount. I waited an hour and 15 minutes for food that should have been here in 45 minutes. The driver said she couldn't give me a discount because it was out of her control. I WILL be talking to the manager.

In addition AGAIN. When I order food I expect it to be right. When I don't get what I order, I expect better than a 25% discount. That's a joke. She was 30 minutes late and brought the wrong food and then the manager tried to blame it on me. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE??

I will have a better day when I get home."

Or anything stupid like that. Sure we'd still have them, but it would be for places that don't have teleporters. Ok so think about it. You want to go to Indianapolis, but gas is like $2.50 a gallon. So you say to yourself ""maybe I should just teleport there. Poof. Done. I could charge what ever I wanted. No problem. You want a burger from a restaurant in Paris. Poof. Done. It would be so very very awesome. Of course I'd have to kill all those that knew the secrets of the creation, but I'd be rich so it wouldn't be a problem. I could just teleport the bodies into the sun. Poof. Done.

I probably sound a little off. I've been have issues with issues. There are certain things that I can't say any more on here because my soon to be exwife has printed off all my previous journals. Makes me want to make them all private from now on. I mean she doesn't even get that some of them are very private and not for her to use against me. Not that it will get very far in court, but it's about the violation of my personal space. What a jerk. I'm suprised that she hasn't threatened me about the last post, I mean it was rather sexist..... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

I just don't understand hurting others to make yourself feel better. I try not to get caught up in it, and I try to not want to retaliate, but I feel angry and hurt. It's a good thing I'm too lazy. I mean seriously, I could conquer earth if I put a little bit of effort into it. Of course once I did that I'd have to deal with the aliens that the US government is hiding, but with great power......

"event","Why is it ok for women to wear ""men clothes"" but not for men to wear ""women clothes""? I find it odd that a woman can wear pants and a t-shirt and no one says anything. Heck you could put women in a man's suit jacket and some men, probably me included, find that hot, but as soon as you put a man in a dress, it gets taboo. Why? Why can't I wear a dress? Women used to only wear dresses. Then came the women's liberation movement. I ahve no problem with that. What I have a problem with is that men and women are treated different, but it's only a problem when we treat women bad. For example. If a man becomes a nurse or something along those lines with no want to become a doctor, people find that odd. If a woman wants to be a professional wrestler, people find that not odd. Or atleast not any more odd than normal. And didn't we learn back in the civil rights movement that seperate but equal is not equal? I have a friend of mine who just recieved a scholorship. I was happy for her. The problem was that she recieved it from the WOMEN'S business association. WOMEN'S!!! Why is there a women's business association? Heck, her defense is that there is a men's business association and they do the same thing. The problem being that seperate but equal is WRONG!! I'm not saying that they broke any laws, but I am saying that it isn't right for one side, either side, to get different treatment. I know that people aren't perfect, but I would think that in most cases we can strive for that goal.

Along the same topic. Why is it that because I am white I have less scholorship oportunities availible to me? Don't get me wrong, I think that every person should have a chance to go to college, but because I am white, regardless of income, I have a ""lesser"" statistical chance of getting a scholorship. (I put lesser in quotes because I refuse to believe in statistics.) Why can't we just take all the money that is given out for scholorships from the NAACP and give it to ANYONE regardless of race. Why should the question of race even be on the ISTEP? Is my answer to #54 going to be wrong if I'm not white? I know it's an optional question, but it should bs so optional that it's not on the tests. They use those answers to for statistics. They use those statistics to show that one race of people is ""doing worse"" than the others and should be treated differently. BULL SHIT!!!! I say to you now that if I never get to get a scholorship because all the smart people got better scores than me, good for them. If I can't get a scholorship because I'm white, BULL SHIT.

I will say that I am both sexist and racest. I don't try to be, unless I'm joking with my friends about women and their place in the kitchen, but that doesn't mean I'm not. When I'm walking alone at night and a white guy approaches I tense a little. When a black guy approaches I tense a lot. I don't do it on purpose, but it happens. I do try and treat everyone equally, so I try to tense more when the white guy approaches. The point here is that everyone has an opinion. Most people are both sexist and racest. God loves them anyway."

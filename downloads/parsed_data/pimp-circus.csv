I stared at the sky
asked myself how 
wondering why
           Do i sit here
           and wither away
           watch myself die
           day after day
noone home
bloodshot eyes
stay awake
sunrise to sunrise
                and i know that 
                that its wrong
                 to think of you
                while your already gone

Dont let go-----------------
           of everything that we wanted to share
Dont let go-----------------
           gone without you is just something that i cant bare
Dont let go-----------------
           of me and i wont let go of you
Dont let go-----------------
           Cause the fact of the matter is i still love you

Cut myself
feel the pain
blood runs strong
through my veins
              the hurt so strong
              the cut so deep
              the fall so long 
              the fall so steep
lie myself down
so full of fear
push myself up
im drowning in tears
                   now i sit here
                   and think to myself
                   what is wrong
                   what is wrong

wow

I dont know how to explain, I feel the best i have ever felt in my entire life, and its all because of him. All he has to do is touch me and I feel like im the only person he sees. I am so lucky to have found someone who makes me feel like im beautiful, because i dont ever. All the little things about him make me smile, his terrible jokes... no offense sweety but they are lude. His hands and how they are just enough bigger than mine that i feel small but not like a little kid. i spent a half an hour just talking to him when i went to drop him off, it was great. I hope that i always feel like i do tonight. I knew that God must have had a reason for all of the bad stuff that happend lately, and the reason is him. I am the luckiest person alive, simply because im his... sweet dreams guys I know mine will be

"event","aight this is a short post, so here it goes

Child, don't you worry
It's enough your growing up in such a hurry
Brings you down, the news they sell ya
To put in your mind that all mankind is a failure

But nobody knows
What's gonna happen tomorrow
We try not to show
How frightened we are

If you love me, I'll protect you
However I can
You've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end

Fighting because we're so close
There are times we punish those who we need the most
Though we can't wait for a saviour
Only got ourselves to blame for this behaviour

And nobody knows
What's gonna happen tomorrow
We try not to show
How frightened we are

Would seem lonely
If you were the only
star in the night?

You've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end
You've got to believe
It'll be alright again

Time is a ribbon, a silent icy river (froze us all)
Running deep, deep and fast
Enough to get lost down in the flow
Crashing around
These tiny lives mean everything

And nobody knows
What's gonna happen tomorrow
So don't let go
Now we've come this far

Hold my hand please
Understand me
You're never alone

We've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end
(Nobody knows)
You've got to believe
It'll be alright my friend
Da, da, da, da

And yes we believe
It'll be alright again
(Nobody knows)

end"

You may think its sad but i think its great i have never celebrated a valentines day due to the fact that i have not had anyone to celebrate it with, but it all changed November, 16, 2004, at 9:44 PM when the most amazing person said yes to being my girlfriend, I can honestly say the past 3 months have been the most amazing part of my life. I owe all my happiness and all my love to one person, I am head over heels for her and my love for her just grows stronger with each passing day she is the most perfect person i have ever met. She is the missing piece to my puzzle and i am now complete. I hope this never ends...=) </P>

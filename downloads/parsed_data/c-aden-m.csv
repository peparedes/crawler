"event","soo I haven't hung out with the valley girls in a while. a lot happend in a short while apparently. I guess megan and and ex are getting really serious again, bummer. well like i said, I gotta respect her as a friend in order to not ruin anything that we DO have, even if it's not what I had hoped for. I just hope she's happy, and knows I'm here for her if anything goes wrong. Good luck megan. oh and i guess anne is all crushed about some guy so john wants to be there for her, typical ladies' man, (douche).
on a lighter note, today i hung out with the guys. we got pulled over. no ticket, thank god. I'm not too into this livejournal so i'm gonna go"

"event","wow I guess I kind of forgot about this thing. I just called Megan, it's lunch time there. I don't think she was interested in talking so i let her go. Nothing has changed since I bought her the ring and flowers for her birthday, sort of a dissapointment. I don't exactly have a problem with our friendship as it is, I just think it could be so much more, because I am more than ready. You know it's hard to respect someone's wishes to only be friends when you have these kinds of feelings for them, but I have yo because she's a great friend and I have no intention of ruining that. I need to go to the store, later."

"event","I guess this is my first entry, Ann and Megan basically forced me to get one of these livejournal accounts... anything for them I guess. Very chill day hangin out with John and a bunch of the guys all day and not worrying about any work. Homeschool is not working out good because without a teacher to nag on my ass all day I don't get anything done and Thats how I fail. not a great idea but thats just me talkin. I need to get my truck fixed soon I am SO tired of relying on my brother for rides, even if we have the same friends. I need freedom haha uhAmber asked me out again today and I said no AGAIN. I don't want to keep doing this to her but I'm really not feeling it at all. she knows for a fact I like someone else but she wants to know who umm she lives in Palmer. I hope she is reading this, you know who you are. We need to hang out. soon. I don't know if you feel the same, but I really want to get closer to you. I sound queer so I'm going to stop, but if you read this Megan let me know. The last few weeks all I have been doing is hangin out with Megan, Ann, and my brother. So John of course focuses on Ann and that gives me and Megan time to hang out. It's awesome getting to know those girls. they are pretty hilarious, even if they get bitchy... kidding"

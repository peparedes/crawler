"event","January 27, 2009. A good day for Hayden Wright.<br /><br />Today was the first day of school for the spring semester, and I am signed up for the following classes in this order:<br /><br />Philosophy 9:35-11:00<br />World Music 11:10-12:35<br />Concert Jazz 1:00-4:00<br />Italian 4:20-6:35<br /><br />Altogether, a very good schedule.<br /><br />I start the day off with phil, an interesting choice for a first class I must admit, but it looks Hella good, with a capital H. Online, people said that this professor Pidgeon guy is a legend around San Diego, and it is apparent. The guy is awesome. He is an old guy with almost no hair and glasses, and right away his presence give you a sense that he knows alot. Right off the bat, the guy was making the entire class laugh. The class is about logic, and how to think apparently, which is good in my book. Add the fact that everyone seems to think that phil would fit me to a T, and you've got a promising year of high quality learnin' on your hands. Excited? Yes.<br /><br />Next is World Music, which is basically a class in which we listen to music from all over the world and study why it invokes so much &quot;irrational behavior&quot; in humans. It's taught by Romeo, who also does the Jazz band I am in. Before I thought Romeo was a little close minded when it came to everything (his attitude towards some things sorta gives you the feeling that he is more down to earth than nessesary, if you know what I mean), but just from the first lecture he gave us, I found out that he is infact a very intellectual person. And I'm looking forward to the music that he is going to have us listen to, and the final project as well. Excited to hear good music? Fuck yes.<br /><br />Then comes Concert Jazz. Excited to play some music? FUCK&nbsp;yes.<br /><br />... But wait, I almost forgot the most remarkable part of the class! Just when I thought that it would be just another good semester in Concert Jazz, a challenger appeared! I was writing information about myself down on a notecard, just when someone walked in the room. I was concentrating, so I didn't even look up, but I would soon find out and be sorely disappointed at my discovery. Romeo asked what the new person's name is, and a girl's voice answered: &quot;Christina.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christina? </em>I thought, <em>Christina? Hmm... Ok, a girl in our class is named Christina, no big deal.</em><br /><br />&quot;What school did you go to?&quot;<br />&quot;Mission Bay High.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What? Maybe I know he-- OH&nbsp;FUCK. NO. NO. NO.<br /><br /></em>&quot;Oh, well then maybe you know Hayden then.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Jesus Christ son of Mary, please God, no. Please let my ears decieve me this once.<br /><br /></em>&quot;Hey, Hayden.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em>Hayden snaps his head up</em>*<br /><br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FFFUUUUUUUU--<br /><br /></em>&quot;Hey, Nina.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --UUUUUUCK. God, why me?</em><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *End scene*<br /><br /><br />Seriously, wasn't the gift I got for graduation the fact that I would never have to deal with Nina in a fucking band anymore? No? Well that's what I should have got. But, on the bright side, I get to see the &quot;Little Girl&quot; get yelled at by Romeo and Joe for not playing shit right, instead of the treacherous supporting hand of JP Balmat. Sweet justice is swift and sweet. Excited to see Nina's ass chewed out by various band members? <strong>FUCK&nbsp;</strong>yes.<br /><br />Last, but not least, is Italian. I was crashing this class, because my mother insisted that I took Kehrenberg, and I see why. She is very fast, doesn't talk too much english, and is very cool. I&nbsp;have a feeling that I will be speaking Italian before too long, which will be cool, because I can talk to my mom in Italian and nobody will know what the hell we are talking about. Excited about learning a new language? <em>Mamma mia, si!<br /><br /></em>Now I am in the library dicking around the internet. Soon I will go home, eat, and sleep. Tomorrow is going to be another exciting day!<br /><br /><em>I'm Hayden Wright and I approved this&nbsp;first day of college.</em><br /><br />"

"event","Ok, I guess I'm back to write here again, although it wont be long, because my computer is about to die.<br /><br />So, basically nothing has changed since the last time I wrote, I still haven't done enough playing, and I&nbsp;still hate work.<br /><br />I've also realized that I REALLY need an upright bass already. It's beginning to be a problem. I haven't even seen one in at least a month, and it is making me a little desperate. Sure I have my electric, but it is not nearly the same. And I am also concerned about the jazz class I'm in again, because I have made absolutely NO progress whatsoever in regards to site reading music, and I think that is the reason I got a B in that class instead of an A. Well, there are more reasons, but I'm blaming it on that. Also, I am trying to remember the name of my Astronomy teacher from last semester because I am going to rate him on ratemyprofessors.com. Hmm...<br /><br />Well, I'd better go get further ready for school tomorrow, even though I don't think there is much to get ready for yet. My laptop, some papers, and then the rest of the stuff I take with me everywhere I go, and I think that covers it. Geez, life is busy.<br /><br />In other news, I don't know what to eat for dinner, but that's sorta trivial for a journal entry, eh?<br /><br />SIEVERS! That's what his name was... Ok, I&nbsp;can die happy now.<br /><br />Well, I&nbsp;should stop rambling, especially because my computer just alerted me that there is only 10% battery life left and typing is reallllllly dragging along. With that said, I'm outta here!<br /><br /><em>I'm Hayden Wright, and I approved this entry.</em><br /><br />"

"event","Alright, I'm giving in today. I'll go on this stupid sight so I can vent about things to nobody about nothing just like everyone else in the world. I guess it can't go wrong, eh?<br /><br />First topic of the day: I was looking at my older posts I must have made at least a year ago, probably longer. I&nbsp;was a sorry kid back then, let me tell you. You never realize how much you have REALLY grown unless you look at some old journal entries... yikes! I was also more dramatic with my writing, filling it with the most overused phrases ever known to man. I really have improved, or at least progressed. And some of the subject matter was masked, I see. Probably about some chick that I dug at that time (pick your favorite, that's what I did.) At least I documented the day I&nbsp;bought <em>Snakes and Arrows</em>, but I had to follow it up with some stupid comment.<br /><br />I really was a loser back then. Well, more than I&nbsp;am right now anyway.<br /><br />OK, next topic. Obama is officially the president now, woo. Topic closed.<br /><br />Lately I've been thinking about writing a book. I'm not sure what it would be about, but it would probably be a pointless story with minimum moral. Either that or I'll attempt at writing an epic like Rush's <em>2112</em> or <em>Cygnus X-1</em>, and then attempt to make actual song good enough to show anyone. It kinda makes me want to get some recording software on my computer so that I can put my ideas down. Usually, I try to make a mental note of the cool riff I&nbsp;just played or maybe an idea of what a song could sound like, but I always end up picking up my bass next time around and saying to myself &quot;What was that cool idea I had? *Searching my fretboard* Oh well, I'll think of it later.&quot; But I never do.<br /><br />I should really just write things down. I have some good ideas, but I don't take the time to put them down on paper. I'll start doing that from now on, and maybe this (meaning livejournal) will help with that. I'm also thinking about signing up to get the newspaper everyday. Not only will it keep me up with current events, it will also give me some ideas for songs, like how John Lennon used to do. If you know enough about the Beatles as I do, you'll know that the Lennon half of the song<em> A Day in the Life</em> was based on what John Lennon read in a newspaper; <em>&quot; I read the news today, oh boy&quot; </em>etc., etc. Paul McCartney even borrowed the idea to write <em>Eleanor Rigby</em>, as he took inspiration from the obituaries to write it. But he's still a wanker, that McCartney. Damn him for making good music.<br /><br />Other than that, I haven't too much to say today. I have to work on saturday for 9 hours, and you know how much fun can be packed into one long and gruelling day at Vons. You don't you say? Well! Why don't we switch jobs then, eh? It will be a learning experience for all of us.<br /><br />OK, I've sat here for too long trying to think of another topic, so I'll just conclude this entry.<br /><br />This could or could not be my last entry in a while; I don't know if this livejournal thing will catch on, because it didn't last time. At least I gave it a shot, eh Melissa?<br /><br /><em>I'm Hayden Wright, and I approved this LiveJournal.com entry.</em><br /><br />"

"event","<p align=""center"">Well, this past week was pretty good so far.<br /><br />On monday, it was a regular day... nothing special.<br /><br />Yesterday, I had the Honor Band concert, Mr. B said I did very good, but&nbsp;i messed up a few times (and there was certain bass malfunctions on my part...). So that was cool.<br /><br />Today was the best so far! I went to Best Buy after school today to get ""Snakes and Arrows"", the new album by Rush! And do you really think&nbsp;I wasn't prepared? I brought my&nbsp;CD player along with me today just so I could listen to ""Snakes and Arrows"" <em>right after I bought it!!! </em>That's called <strong>Instant Gratification</strong>, baby, and it's awesome. And on top of that, I got a free bag of chips from a vending machine, and I even made this poem:<br /><br /><strong><u>Waltz<br /><br /></u></strong>Atoms smash...<br />New cars crash...<br />Termites raid...<br />Pictures fade...<br /><br />Machines fail<br />Humans die<br />Catfish flail<br />Newborns cry<br /><br />Lies are born<br />Hearers scorn<br />They, too, need<br />Yet they feed<br /><br />Love then Live<br /><u>Horribly<br /></u>Feelings gived<br />""Nat'rally""<br /><br />Malfunction<br />Destruction<br />Fustration<br />Creation<br /><br />...yet they make<br />...help you go<br />...(for their sake)<br />...and these show!<br /><br />(end)<br /><br />Granted i had to do this for school, it isn't too bad, is it?<br /><br />Anyways, that's about the all... until tomorrow (what wonders might bring?) !</p>"

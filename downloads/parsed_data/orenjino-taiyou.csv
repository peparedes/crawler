*Blush* Like a REAL sex dream.

*Blush* About a friend.

*blushblushblush* I'm going to be SO embarrassed the next time I see her.

I feel really guilty.  Not that I had a sex friend about someone  besides Yasha...  But because I enjoyed it.  A lot.  I know she doesn't feel the same way xD so I know it would never come true.  I would never do anything to ruin the relationship that Yasha and I have.  I've worked to hard for this, but it really sucks that I will never be able to explore this side of myself.  Not that I would ever had the chance if Yasha gave the ok.  Haha.  I'd have to find a woman that was attracted to me.  Pah.  Good luck with that."

This is Commander Video from the Bit Trip games...  Pretty simple design, but he turned out MASSIVE!  Bryce his new owner loves it.

It has a poorly scribed story on the inside about how she fell in love with Bryce and moved to America from Canada.  I could not for the life of me figure out HOW to get this thing to close and stay closed. xD


And now my favorite...  This was for Bron.

He loves steak more then anything in the world so he will always have steak no matter where he goes.



Also my friend <lj user=""blackberrypie""> sent me a BUTT TON of free patterns so I can make ALL THE THINGS!  xD  I promise not to let you down!  I will become an awesome sewer now!










Oh a side note...  Even though the voice acting didn't go as well as I was hoping...  I've been enlisted to sing in one of Stephen's future games...  I think I was super intimated by the mic and the whole recording thing...  I was disappointing in myself because all the noises he wanted me to make were noises I make all the time!

Here it is!  Finally got off my ass and finished this Luma, its a practice one before I make the real one I was commissioned for.

It has a few mistakes, the top doesn't meet up like I would like, it needs some more fluff, the eyes are different sizes xD, the arms are different shapes, and I need to figure out how to make the seem on the back less noticeable.  Besides all that, I'm really happy with it!"

Things that we were holding back and things that needed to be said.  I feel better then I've felt in years and I know he does too and its such a relief.  Even thought talking can hurt it also helps a ton as well.

I have a great couple of friends inside and out side of work.  I have my wonderful little dog to take care of and smother with love until I can get my own.  Stephen and I are better then we've been in years.  I have a lot to be happy and grateful about.  My little life is slowing building its self back up to normal.


I still hate my job, but I have things to take that off my mind.  Just suffer though the day then I can spend a couple hours with Bao and Dai lou.  Come home to the cross eyed exploding with happiness and a handsome love man.

"event","I have a thing for Super heroes...  and video games.  My major weakness is Batman.  I have a cape, the official Batman training manual, Batarangs, and the over all out of my mind in saneness to become part of the Batman Family.  The few things I missing is my parents are still alive, I'm not at all athletic, and Batman Family isn't real so they can't take me in.  But this blog isn't about my outlandish fantasies of my over active imagination.  Its for my to bitch about whatever is in my head weight lose wise.

       I keep falling off the wagon because I'm lame.  I want results.  I need results.  My body is screaming for them.  Telling me that if I don't get them it will start to shut down and cause me health problems.  I really didn't think 260 was that huge!  I guess its to big for me...  I joined MFP with a friend of mine (BatCola) and was doing really well!  I lost 4 pounds in the first 2 weeks!  Fuckin' yeah!  I was so pumped!  This site as really taught me that I don't eat that poorly - but my portions are too big, and I don't exercise enough.  I was on a low carb wheat roll with no butter, baby!

     But that what then...  This is now.  I have gained the 4 pounds back...  haven't lost anything else, I'm to scared to get on the scale.  I feel like I've gotten heavier.  I ripped a thigh out of my pants last night while out with friends, and I just begged to disappear...

      ""When did I get this bad?!  Why am I like this?"" I asked my fiance almost in tears.  He helped my dry my eyes and reminded me that he, 'loves his big girl'.  I asked him why do I just give up?  He told me because I don't see results fast enough.  Its true...  When you 300 crunches, 30 aerobics, 30 of strength training (ever other day) and 30 of walking the dog, every day for two weeks and nothing changes...  I give up.  It seems worthless, and a waste of time.  Sure I FEEL better about myself but I guess that's not enough.

      Maybe I just don't have the willpower for it.  Its so much easier to be fat, I think.  But is it really?  Is it really easier to be fat?  I don't really think so.

      I'm looking at my dog asleep on the couch and can't help but think how cute she is.  She's such a fast runner.  I want to run with her one day.  If I ever have kids, I want to be able to keep up with them and play with them.  I want to not feel self conscious every time I eat in public or just being in public,  I want to go to the  beach in my swim suit and not be afraid that if someone lays their eyes on me they will throw up every where.

      I just want to be comfortable with myself."

I've been reading Fruits Basket lately since I finally have all 23 volumes.  Thank you Half Price Books and your one dollar manga sales!  Its a beautiful, heart wrenching story.  I love it so much.  Its probably my 1.5 (1 being sailor moon of course) favorite manga series ever.  I love all the characters very dearly. 

Someone once told me I was delusional.  It hurt my feelings at first, but the more I experience things - the more I think they are right.

This last week I've felt the weight of the world on my shoulders.  I've felt sick with worry.  I felt dreadful, like I was waiting for divine punishment to come and take me away.  Just last night I started to feel better.  What brought this around? 

Fruits Basket.

The story had gotten thick with pain, greed, heartbreak, and desires that will never be fulfilled, but last night, where I left off in the story, everything was getting better and I fell so calm.  I was happy.

Have I always been like this?  Have I always been so wrapped up in whats going on in someone else world when I experience it?  Has it always made me so depressed which in turn makes me think about awful things in my life?  I get to attached to thing.  Things that are not real.  Things I have no control over.  It makes me blow my worries way out of proportion.  Blows them up so huge I break down and cry in the back room of my job.

I wont every stop reading these stories they bring me such joy and such sadness.  They have shown me what I need to work on.  That even though I long desperately to live in one of these many worlds where everything is perfect even though its not.  I can't live there.  I have my own perfectly imperfect world to explore.  I have people that want to get to know me because I am me.  People that love Chii for Chii and no other reason.

I will laugh when that world is happy.
I will cry when that world is sad.
I will cheer when that world needs encouragement.
I will fight when that world needs help.

But when that book closes...  I will come back to my own world and live life as well as I can here.




My New Year's Resolution?
Don't complain until I've tried my very best to fix it.

I've also discovered... I may have not been born in the Year of the Tiger like I thought.  I very well could be an Ox.  I would like to find out when the Chinese New Year of 1986 was since it didn't happen on 01/01/1986 like ever where else.

"event","And since I have no place to go, let me get in my crappy car in the snow!

Two days ago it started to snow, a lot.  But it was still warm enough that it wasn't sticking to the ground.  So I packed my backpack full of thing to play with and hit the road to B.I.B's house. (Bryce, Irena, and Bron)  Made it there no problem.  I told Stephen that I was over there and he said he'd walk the dog then meet me there after he got off work.

He works a half an hour away by freeway.  I thought it would be best if I just walked the dog met him at our apartment and we drive back together to B.I.B's house.  Boy was I wrong...  I drive a 92 Camry that has 300k miles on it.  I'm the second owner and its my first car.  It's had almost 5k put into it since I bought it a year ago for only $1,000.

The tires need replacing but I thought I could make it home because the snow wasn't sticking in the parking lot.  Once I got to the street...  The snow had turned to ice.  My car starts to slip a little and I figure the ""safest"" way out of this mess would be to take the freeway since it should be pack with drivers and the ice should be beaten away.

Once I get on the entrance ramp, my car spins out of control.  I hit the brakes - turns out I should have tapped them until they caught.  My car spins into a wall CRUNCH!  Car stops spinning I get control again.  I make it on the free way.  I slip once.  Slide once.  Then pull over and call Stephen.  I don't know what to do.  I just wanted to go home.  My heart was pounding out of my chest.  I get off the phone with him.  A lady rear ends me.  I call Stephen back tell him I was hit and he tries to come get me.  Once he's here, I send him home...  We weren't sure what we should do.

I call for a tow truck to get my car home.  They said it will be a 6 hour wait.  I've been freezing in my car for 2 hrs already so I say fuck it.  I call Bryce for a ride home and he says okay.  I get hit again but a utilities can, and a hummer.  My car battery dies* so there goes my heat.  (*Note - I didn't have it on the whole time, I would turn it on for a few minutes then turn it off.  I did have my hazards on the whole time though.)

I have to pee and I'm sick of waiting so I start to walk towards Bryce.  He eventually picks me up and takes me home.  I finally get home at 8:30.  My car gets home at 10:30.


What have I learned form all this?  When it snows.  Stay in me in FUCKING house and don't drive a car with ONE GOOD TIRE!

What else have I learned?  It's time for a new car..."

Why?  Feeble attempt to not feel so lonely, I guess?  Do I think anybody read them.  No, and if they did, it only made things worse I fear.

I need to realize that I'm not as important to everyone as they are to me.  I need to stop getting so attached so easily.  I need to stop thinking of everyone as family just because they are ""a friend"".  No.  They can't be.  There is a huge difference between the two and when I think like that I get myself hurt.

Instead of crying all the time about how you will never look like a Hollywood Starlet or like Mr. Action Hero just fuck it!  Get to a point where YOU like YOU and just stick to it!  Being a size 2 two with a triple G bra isn't going to make you happy!

Before anyone jumps down my through for going on a diet - I'm not shooting for a size 2.  Like I've said before, I want to between sizes 12 and 16.  That's still pretty round, but I like being round!  Why would I want to look like a boy?  Women are meant to have BOOBS, HIPS, and ASS GOD DAMN IT!  That is what separates US from the BOYS!  Besides that pesky thing between the legs...  But that doesn't really count that much these days.

Maybe I'm just not meant to go back to school.  Maybe I'm just meant to find a job and work my way up. I know people who haven't gong to college and had a successful career!  I have a pretty good job now.  I work full time with a few hours of over time, get pretty good insurance benefits, I work close to home, I work by myself which is kinda lonely...  But I don't have to deal with the drama and two-timing at the bigger cafe I used to work at. I have a nice apartment in a good neighborhood, my fiance Stephen loves me, my car is finally running okay.  I don't go with out but I don't live in the lap of luxury.  Money is tight but that is my fault and I'm getting out of that habit.  Then why do I feel like such a failure for nothing going to school?  I feel like such a LOSER!  Everyone around me has graduated college and is working in a field they love.

The event that sparked this entry was my dream last night.  I dreamed of school.  I dreamed of being in literacy workshop again and how that made me miss math for 3 years, and social studies for 3 years.  In my dream all the teachers thought I was skipping so I was failing those two classes and was going to be kicked out of school and black balled so I couldn't go back.  Is my dream telling me that I shouldn't go?  Is it just a waste of time?  Am I just going to fail out like I did my entire elementary, middle, and high school journey?

I hated school.  I HATED SCHOOL!  It brought me so much misery I even tried to suffocate myself 4 times.  Lucky for me I was to lazy to keep my face pressed against the pillow (truth be told, I had no idea what I was doing).  I think back on it now and all I can think of is the torment from my dad, the horrible grades, the no friends, being held back a year, thinking that I understood everything then bombing a test.  I cried and cried and cried and cried and cried during those 13 years and now I want to put myself through more?!  I must be out of my mind...

The only parts I enjoyed from those horrible years were learning about Japan.  It was my saving grace.  I don't understand what it is with that country that I'm so drawn to...  A friend of mine, Paula, says I was Japanese in a past life and I want to go home.  I guess that makes sense...

The language, the culture, the architecture, the traditions.  I love it all!  I love it!  I don't care that I will never be fully accepted by every one there because, some people are racist.  Its like that where ever you go!  I would give (almost) anything to go back there.  To live there.  Its the only place I've ever felt comfortable!

but the school situation would be even worse there...

I'm just doomed to be miserable, aren't I?"

"event","I just saw pictures of myself from Stephen's graduation back in May.  What the hell happened?!  I only uploaded the ones that you couldn't tell on to Face Book.

My weight is out of control.  Two summers ago I weighted 290 then I fought it down to 230 the lightest I've been since coming back from Japan in 2005 where I weighted 210.

After looking at those pictures I got on the scale....  I'm back up to 260!  I was 240 2 weeks ago!  I've gained 20 pounds in 2 weeks?!  How the HELL did that happen?!  I HAVE NOT been eating more, and I HAVE been moving more!  I don't know if walking the dog counts as working out, but I walk her at least half an hour ever day and we've had her for 2 weeks!  So if ANYTHING I should have LOST 20!

I don't get it...  I just don't get what I'm doing.

I want to loos weight more then anything!  I really do!  But I just don't stick to a deit and work out plan.  Once I get down to 240 I just stop... Or when I get sick I just stop and never pick it up again.

I must not care about losing weight enough to stick to it.  My body is SCREAMING at me that I need to change.

If I sit for too long then I get up, my heels get a splitting pain and its super hard to walk.  My whole legs hurt.  Its hard to breath some things.  I don't sleep well.  I'm even more depressed and moody then normal.  My heart beats weird...  That's the part that scares me the most.

I know I post this stuff ever couple of months but Im really scared.  I need to find the motivation, the care, the need to get up and lose this weight!  I NEED to get under 200 pounds...  I need to lose a total of 130lbs according to doctors.

I don't know...  I just want to live.  Be able to run.

Fuck.  Just to walk up stairs with out getting winded would be pretty boss."

I'm afraid that it won't last, I'm afraid that it will fall apart like everything else in my life.



Whoes fault is it for falling apart?
Its mine.  I don't want to put in the work but I want all the reward.  My lazyness turly carries into everything I do.



Why don't you just get your act together and do it?
I...  Don't DO hard work in relationships.  Work is different then relationships.  There is instant gratifacation with a job.  I get money for every day that I work.  I don't get anything special for talking to someone every day.



Why?
Because they will all leave me behind in the end.  Even Tyler who I spent every day with back in Oregon dumped me to the side when he made a new friend.



Is it wrong for people to make new friends?
No.



Then why are you mad?
I don't like being left behind...



How are you left behind?
I feel like no one wants to hang out with me.  I feel like I'm a burdin when I'm around.  I feel like there are so many other things they could be doing besides being around me.



Are you invited to hang out?
No.  A lot of times I'm invited then univited or forgotten about.


Who fault is that?
Theirs!   If I ment so much to them, they wouldn't have forgotten me!



Why don't you remind them or ask them what is going on?
...



Well?
Pass...



Speak!
I don't like work.



You want everything handed to you?
Yes...



Why?
I like instant gratification...



Well its not working out!
Yeah!  I can tell!



Then why not put yourself out there?  The reason your friendships fall apart is because you let them Stacey.  Get your head outta your ass and spot being a lazy sissy pansy ass!  Its okay to be shy but you need to get out and meet new people.

Dear Stacey,

I know its hard... I know you wish you could afford gym memberships and all those healthy foods that they say you should eat but you can't.  You just can't.  Not now, and I'm not really sure when or if you ever can.  You need to make do with what you have.  

Feel like you have nothing?  You have two working arms, two working legs.  What more do you need?  I know its hard.  I know its tough.  

You know what else?

Your lazy.

You know it.

I know it.

Every one knows it.

There is no reason why you shouldn't be losing this weigh.  You have self control.  You can stop yourself from eating bad things, but you just don't want to.

Its time to stop making excuses and follow through with it.  You want people to rely on you but, how can they when you can't even follow through for yourself?

Sorry, I'm not a very good Oprah,
Stacey

P.s. Don't just blow me off...  People need and depend on you.  Take your on advice for once.  You deserve to feel good about yourself.  You deserve to be happy.  You deserve to respect yourself."

"event","Having a goal weight is stupid.  I hate numbers.  We don't get along.  Were like a grilled cheese and a taco.  I'm going for a goal body shape.  I know what that is.  I want some BANGIN curves with an hourglass figure.

I'm not getting a raise this year because Microsoft is broke.  First reported loss ever.  Fuck...  I couldn't be more broke if I tried.

I couldn't be more excited for my Snorlax hoodie though!  x3!  its goona be so cute I'm gonna die!  I'm thinking about commissioning her for a life size batman cape.  The one I have is to small and kinda chokes me when I wear it. xD

In better news I'm going back to school!  I'm way excited!  Starting int he winter term so I can save up/get as much money for school as I can! xD

































I'm tired.  I only do because trees wants me too.  You hurt me so I can't just ignore it and I hate that I can't let it go.  I see you for the jerk you are but what we had made me happy so I can't forget it."

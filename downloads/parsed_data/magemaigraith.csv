"event","My training progresses.  It seems that all I have time for is bettering my skills.  Though this does keep me from letting my thoughts focus on other things.  I would like to say that I have become a fierce warrior.  But this would be an overstatement.  I find myself less bruised when I return from the fields, so this at least is something.  

Karazhil mentioned a competition to me the other day and I participated.  Truthfully it was not much of a competition.  What it was instead was a group of half naked people running around a confusing enclosure in an attempt to be the first to find the exit.  There were others in there whose sole purpose was to keep us from reaching our goal.  The Mur was there, and if I didn't know better, I would have said that he seemed focused on attempting to hinder my progress, though I imagine that I am most likely mistaken.  Irregardless, I managed to exit the enclosure first and was allowed to claim a prize.  What was more startling was that they will be doing this again, and what I also won was the right  to go through it all another time.  When I explained to Karazhil that I was uncertain that I had, indeed, ""won"" anything she laughed.  Something makes me believe that my irritation amuses her.

She promises to teach me more magic soon.  Though she hints that I should begin researching which path I will take.  There are various spells that I would obtain, and I'm uncertain as to which to get first.  Frustratingly, this indecision tickles her as well.  I am working toward  the day when Karazhil has to look upon me with a hint of respect.  When I first encountered that Mur fellow in the Crossing Town I admit that I was amused by his bluster.  He was well spoken, if a bit proud, and I almost enjoyed the bantering conversations that we had.  I had not yet realized that the entire race views themselves in such high regard.  I find myself disgusted by such behavior.  Which is a shame as the fellow interested me greatly and now I must dismiss him out of hand for the pompous fool that he is. 

Again dawn has come and I must visit the blind healer and then continue on to the fields.  At least spring is here, and the wind on the hills less cruel."

"event","This is a small place, this River town.  The city is petite and easy to navigate, built as it is on a ring system.

It is quiet here.  Mostly.  Though I have noted the arrival of quite a few people.  Strange faces pass me in the streets.  Some design to nod but most rush past without so much as a glance in my direction.  I had let the hood fall from my face to catch the limpid spring sun rays, however, this cursory treatment by these strangers around me has caused me to withdraw once again.

This is rather a silly thing.  If they choose to not notice me on the outset, why should I then attempt to hide myself further?  Would not this withdrawal give them just another excuse to pretend to not notice me?

It is silly the way folk rush about and play as though they do not see one another.  For example, there was a fellow whom I would pass out in the fields.  The both of us stalking the magic wielding goblins, passing each other two or three times a hunt, and never once pausing long enough to give greeting.  I was as guilty of the non contact as he, as I did not call out to him either.

Today, however, I saw him in town.  He was resting and readying the skins he had collected to be resold to the tanner.  Gathering myself, I boldly bid him a good afternoon and made introductions.  It is astounding how such a simple thing takes so much effort to accomplish.  But is is done, and that is one less unknown face that I will pass."

"event","Everything returns to it's beginnings in the end.

This is what I remember being taught.  I don't know that I ever believed it.   Though I am the sort that doesn't believe much of anything until I've experienced it firsthand.

So I am finding the above statement to be true.

I am returned to Riverhaven.  Which was the source of my beginnings.  The only beginnings I remember anyway.

I started here under the narrowed eye of Karazhil and back again I am.  Fools are they who complain about Gauthius in Crossing.  Next to the Mur he is a ray of sunshine.

At least the city is quiet.  There are rumors of war and I have been keeping my nose clear of it."

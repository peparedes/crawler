Some things to keep in mind with Flash:

(1) Flash is great for first impressions. A Flash site will impress first-time customers.
(2) The same Flash site that impresses first-time customers will quickly become familiar
with repeat customers.
(3) A familiar Flash website tends to annoy the customer who visits the site with a particular
goal in mind. For example, Flash sites are not conducive to relaying information or business
strategy. Customers are quickly frustrated by the loading and forced multi-media experience."

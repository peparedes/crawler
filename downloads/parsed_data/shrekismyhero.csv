It brightens up my day
You're voice, the shining sun
Drives all my fears away

Your sparkling eyes they've guided me
Past everyting I've been through
With a lot of hope and a little luck
I always end up with you

I know I've made mistakes
It's my job to accept them
But all I'm going to ask of you
Is please let me correct them

I love you with all my heart
It's been clear since the start
Even though it sometiems rains
My love for you has never changed

Battered and broken
So few words left unspoken
The ones that remain forever true
Jane I Do Cherish You

From the beginning to the end
Through all the thick and thin
One thing that I know is true
Out of all the men in the world, I was made for you

"event","one day, when I was a freshman in high school,
I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school.
His name was Kyle.
It looked like he was carrying all of his
books.
I thought to myself, ""Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday?
He must really be a nerd.""
I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.
As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him.
They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt.
His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him.
He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes
My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye.
As I handed him his glasses, I said, ""Those guys are jerks.
They really should get lives.
"" He looked at me and said, ""Hey thanks!""
There was a big smile on his face.
It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude.
I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived.
As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen him before.
He said he had gone to private school before now.
I would have never hung out with a private school kid before.
We talked all the way home, and I carried some of his books.
He turned out to be a pretty cool kid.
I asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends.
He said yes.
We hung out all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of him.
Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again.
I stopped him and said, ""Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday!
"" He just laughed and handed me half the books.
Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends.
When we were seniors, we began to think
about college.
Kyle decided on Georgetown, and I
was going to Duke.
I knew that we would always be friends, that the miles would
never be a problem.
He was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship.
Kyle was valedictorian of our class.
I teased him all the time about being a nerd.
He had to prepare a speech for graduation.
I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and speak
Graduation day, I saw Kyle.
He looked great.
He was one of those guys that really found himself during high
school.
He filled out and actually looked good in glasses.
He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.
Boy, sometimes I was jealous.
Today was one of those days.
I could see that he was nervous about his speech.
So, I smacked him on the back and said, ""Hey, big guy, you'll be great!""
He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled.
""Thanks,"" he said.
As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began
""Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years.
Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly your friends...
I am here to tell all of you that being a
friend to someone is the best gift you can give them.
I am going to tell you a story.""
I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met.
He had planned to kill himself over the weekend.
He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home.
He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.
""Thankfully, I was saved.
My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable""
I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment.
I saw his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same
grateful smile.
Not until that moment did I realize it's depth.
Never underestimate the power of your actions.
With one small gesture you can change a person's life.
For better or for worse.
God puts us all in each other's lives to impact one another in some way.
Look for God in others.

You now have two choices, you can:

1) Pass this on to your friends or

2) Delete it and act like it didn't touch your heart.

As you can see, I took choice number 1.
""Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly.""

There is no beginning or end.. Yesterday is history.

Tomorrow is mystery.

Today is a gift.

It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care. Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND.

If it comes back to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends.

So go on and post it"

She thinks I hung the moon 
She tells me every morning, 
""They just don?t make men like you"" 

She thinks I've got it together 
She swears I'm as tough as nails 
But I don?t have the heart to tell her 
She don?t know me that well 

She don't know how much I need her 
She don't know I?d fall apart 
Without her kiss, without her touch 
Without her faithful, loving arms 
She don't know that it's all about her 
She don't know I can't live without her 
She's my world, she's my everything 
And she thinks she needs me 

Sometimes she cries on my shoulder 
When she's lying next to me 
But she don't know that when I hold her 
That she's really holding me, holding me 

She don't know how much I need her 
She don't know I?d fall apart

She thinks she?s the lucky one

When you smile I can feel all my passion unfolding 
Your hair brushes mine 
and a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause 


I Do, Cherish you 
For the rest of my life 
You don't have to think twice 
I will, love you still, from the depths of my soul 
It's beyond my control 
I've waited so long to say this to you 
If you're asking do I love you this much, I do 
In my world before you 

I lived outside my emotions 
Didn't know where I was going 
Until that day I found you 
And you opened my eyes to a new paradise 
In a world torn by change 
With all of my heart, until my dieing day 

I've waited so long to say this to you 
So, if you're asking do I love you this much, I do 
Oh, I do

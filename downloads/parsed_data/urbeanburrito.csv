"event","My life is so pathetic. I'm just bored out of my mind. My weekend was so lame, as usual. I worked on saturday (of course. It was a really super long day....Afterwards I walked over to Dunn Bros. cause my mom was there. She bought me a chicken caeser salad wrap (which is really yummy)! Then Nicole J. walked in with her friend Matt so I went and sat with them. It was nice running into her. I'll have to call her one of these days...But yeah, then I went home and watched tv. Yesterday I sat around all day until my dad picked me and Andy up. We went to Target because I was dying to get Wheat's cd. It's fairly good by the way. We went out to eat after that. And then we went to a movie. I made my daddy take me to The Notebook. Heeheehee...it was funny. I felt kinda silly though. There were all these couples like my age, and I was there with my DAD. Lol. Oh well, my daddy's cool.
Blaaahhh....thats just how my life is. Anyways, thats it. Life is boring... BLLAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Yeah...so I haven't really written anything in here for a LOOOOONG time. Sorry. My internet wasn't hooked up for a while and my other computer is a piece, so I haven't been online very often. 

Well, I just got back from North Dakota a couple days ago. We were up there for about 5 days. Carlon (my step-dad) is from there, and we went to his cousin's farm for the fourth of July and met a bunch of his relatives. The second day we were up there we went to one of his other cousin's cabins and we were going to watch fireworks that night, but it was really rainy and windy, so they were cancelled. It was a bummer. But earlier that day I went to the International Peace Gardens with Keith and Janet (Carlon's brother and his wife) and their kids. It was GORGEOUS there. It was also my first time in Canada, so that was kinda cool. It sooo pretty in North Dakota. That was my first time being there also. But I took 5 rolls of film on the whole trip!  We also went to the Badlands while we were there. That was soooo cool. It was so beautiful there. While we were driving through there a herd of buffalo was on the road. So my mom, my brother, and I got in the back of the truch to take pictures. It was so awesome! These huge buffalo were right next to us! There were also some babies. It was just the coolest thing. 

But thats all I really have to say for now. The past couple days haven't been too thrilling. I slept-over at Nicole's the other night. And I worked last night and I'm workin again today. (Ugh, I'm getting so sick of work that I could puke!) But thats pretty much it! I promis to post more later!
Love,
ME"

BUT Amanda's mom made her pick between the two and she picked the party, so we didn't go to the carnival. Oh well. But yeah, my mom made jam today and she had a paper bag FULL of rubarb and I had to clean it all and cut it all into pieces for her. IT SUCKED! It took my 2 hours! Ick, sorry, just thought I'd share that. So then tonight I went to Ambers. It was kind of a bummer though. We were going to have a bonfire, but it didn't work out. And then like everybody (except me) forgot their swimsuits, so we didn't go in the hot tub. But we did watch some movies. And then I went for a walk with Nicole, Chelsea, and Amber H. so the could ""eat skittles"". And then later, back in the house Nicole and Chelsea were being retarded and Chelsea pushed Nicole on top of me and we bonked heads, so now I'll probably have a bruise on my forehead tomorrow. Yay, but it was kinda funny. Hmmm....yeah, anyways. Tomorrow I'm going to my cousin Ryan's grad party. That'll be cool. I have seen Karen in a while and it will be nice to talk to her.

Then we went to the Outlet Mall so my grandma could buy clothes (since she doesn't exactly have any anymore). I felt so sad seeing her. The whole time her eyes just looked so sad. She's dealing with the whole thing pretty well, but you can tell she's really sad. But that was pretty much my whole day. It was nice spending time with them and everything, but like I said, it was SAD. Anyways, I got home and watched Never Been Kissed. I could watch that movie over and over. Its so frickin cute. Ahhh.....But that's pretty much it. Tomorrow I'm workin. Amanda's having a party, so I might go to that afterwards. It shall be interesting."

She kinda gave me a funny look at first but then she was singing it too. Ya hoo. But I don't know... I'm so confused about this one guy, and I have said the same thing about him in here before. I like him, but at the same time I don't want to. And I end up avoiding him kinda, even though I don't want to. And then when we do talk, I feel really good. I just wish something would happen. Urghhhhhh.....boys........

Well, tomorrow I'm not going to school. I'm going to go down to my Grandma's and help clean up and stuff. I'm kinda scared to see all that stuff. It's gonna be sad.

Ya know who is the coolest person in the world??? MEGAN GRAMKE!!! I miss her oh soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!! I'm talking to her right now, and I haven't in a super-duper long time. We're talking about Harry Potter and it's so cool that she gets just as excited about all that HP stuff as me.

Then I got online and started to talk to Karen. I asked her if she knew about grandma and she said no. So I called her and told her and we both just started crying. It's so incredibly sad. The whole thing burned down and EVERYTHING in it. And, yeah, my grandma had a ton of stuff! It sucks so much. That house was so beautiful. It was one of my favorite places in the world. I can't even tell you how much I loved going there and just being in her house. It just made me feel good. And I have SOOOO many memories there. I just can't believe I'll never go back there again.

On Friday I went to the rugby game with Veronica and Brittney. It was soo fun. Rugby's awesome. It was so cold though. I froze me butt off! So after that we decided to go to Dunn Bros. to get stuff to warm us up and then we just went to Zumiez to see if there were any hot guys working. And, yeah, there were. :) Yeah, long story....

Saturday was a pretty mellow day. In the morning I helped my mom get a bunch of crap together for a garage sale. Then I want to work, as usual. Today I worked to. All day. There were SO many crabby customers who came in! I was ready to just slap one of them. Then this one guy came in with a screaming baby that would not shut up. Oh man...I have to work tomorrow too. I don't know if I'll be able to. It's going to be so boring. God, I'm starting to feel like I live at that place. And it sucks now that Jeremy isn't there anymore. I'm getting really sick of the other girls. Jeremy made things really fun. Hmmm....oh well...

It has been QUITE a while since my last entry. Oh well. I'd like to say it's because I have a life now, but it's just because all our comp's are stupidly slow and messed up and I don't really have the patience for them so I sit around and watch tv instead. Haha. Sooo.... life has been pretty cool lately. I've been feeling so much better now that it's spring and stuff. Tonight I'm going to Arts of the Knight. It's kinda messed up. I was gonna go with Veronica, but she had to stay at school to help out with junior high track stuff. So, now Dan's going to pick me up on his way over there. But since he's in jazz band he has to be there pretty early and he's picking me up and 6:15 and it doesn't start until 7. So I dunno, I'm gonna have to go on a search for Veronica or something....this will be interesting I'm thinking.Hmmm.... but I'm soooo excited. I'm going to the DASHBOARD CONCERT!!! Yay!!! I'm going with Amber and omg, it's going to be sooo fun. I still can't believe I'm going. Ahhh!!! 
But, that's not it. Oh no. This summer I'm going to Los Vegas!!! I'm SOOOO incredibly awesome. I've only really been to Wisconsin, and it will be my first time on a plane, ah. And the coolest thing is I'm going with my aunt, uncle, and cousin Karen. And seriously, I was thinking this a couple days ago, if I could go on vacation with anyone, it would be Kare-bear. I just know we'll have so much fun. But I have to go get ready. Later.

I bought 4 shirts, a pair of cropped pants, 3 pairs of flip-flops (keehee), and sunglasses. But yeah, it's confusing down there, and we almost got lost a couple times.  But it was cool. It was SUCH a nice day too! I'm so happy it's spring! 

I got home and just sat around for a while. Then my dad picked Andy and me up at 6. We went to that new Johnny Depp movie. It was really weird, but good. My dad had the whole thing figured out halfway through the movie and told me, so I pretty much new what was going to happen. After that we went out to eat at Perkins. Our waiter was kinda cute. I really think I should be a waitress because every restaurant I go to there are cute waiters. Hmm....

Well, tomorrow I'm working ALL day!! 12-7. Not really lookin forward to that. I'm kind of worried to. My cousin is getting married next weekend, on Saturday, and I forgot to take that day off. So I have to see if someone can work for me, and I don't think that's going to happen. So I guess we'll see...

And in all the fighting scenes they were really close to us, it was crazy. Ya know, I read Romeo and Juliet last year in English and we watched to movie of it, but it was kinda boring. But one you see it onstage its completely different and, oh man, it was just incredible. Plus, the guy who played Romeo was really hot. We got back to my grandma's at about 11. She made us tea and poured them in these fancy teacups and we sat in her living room with the fireplace on (its a gas one) and my grandma read her book while Karen and I read her little kid books that she used to read to us. It was fun. Very relaxing too. 

I haven't really done much so far this week. I've had it all of because of spring break. I worked twice this week. Hey yeah! Lara got a job there! That will be so fun! I'm really excited! Today my dad picked me and Andy up. We went to this one store so Andy could get crap for his paintball gun (God he's turning into such a hick!) Then we went to Kohl's so I could get something for my cousin Annie's wedding. It's already like in a week and a half or so! Ugh. I'm not really looking forward to it. But oh well. Tonight when I got home I called Amanda. We went to the DOLLAR STORE since it was so nice out. I got a bunch of crap, like I usually do. Lol, its so fun. But, um, guess what she told me tonight. SHE'S MOVING!!! I don't really feel sad about it yet. It hasn't sunk in. I just don't believe it, at all. This all just really sucks. Ya know, first I frickin move, then Sarah, moves and now AMANDA!? I can't take it anymore. I've lost enough friends! I don't know what I'm going to do without Manda. The good thing is she won't be moving too far away and I'd still get to see her once in a while.

They're both kinda crazy. Nicole was sitting on the counter and just being Nicole. Chris kept asking for free cookies and, I dunno. They were funny. Then they left and about 5-10 minutes later Amanda came in to see me. The b*tch went shopping without me!!! I've only told her a million times this week that I want to go shopping and that we should go shopping together. But what does she do? Goes shopping while I'm at work!!! Grrr.....she better go to the dollar store sometime with me this week. Ahem, ahem. But it's all good. Veronica and I are planning on going sometime this week anyways. Well, yeah. I was really mad when I got home from work. I wanted to eat the left-over Angel Hair Pasta that I made the other night, but a certain fat cow who lives in my house ATE IT!!!! He also ate the other box of Rice-a-Roni that I picked out at the grocery store and that I was planning on making sometime!!! He's gonna die when he gets home. Seriously.

Well, I'm really excited right now. Tomorrow my grandma is taking me and Karen (my cousin)to see Romeo and Juliet and the Guthrie! We're also gonna sleep-over. I looooove when we have our little girls weekends. Karen and my grandma are 2 of my very favorite people and I feel so loved when I'm around them.

I feel pretty happy right now. Today has been a pretty good day. I GOT A RIDE FROM AMANDA (she's going to be so happy when she reads this!) So that was nice. We got to school really early and just chilled. Photo was so silly. My teacher is half Irish so she goes all out for St. Patricks day. She brought all these Irish music cd's to school and we listened to them in the classroom and in the darkroom. I have to admit though, I kinda liked it. The rest of the day was same as always. Almost fell asleep in algebra and french, haha. But I don't know... tonight I had to go to a speaker for religion. He was pretty good. So, I don't really know why I'm feeling so happy and optimistic right now. Maybe it's because spring break is next week. Or it could just be that I'm listening to Rascal Flatts. Ahhh.....their music makes me feel so good...The lead singer has such a cool voice.

So, I guess it was more like a get-together instead of a party. Anyways, we sat in the hot-tub and stuff. I watched some of Jeepers Creepers 2. That movie is like scary, stupid, and funny all at the same time. Amber kept grabbing me and yelling at me at all the suspensefull parts, making me scream! It was so mean! So, I don't know. That was basically all that went on. It wasn't as fun as her Halloween party, but hey, it was better than just sitting at home, right?

No school today. I woke up at seven though. It was kinda sad. I had the weirdest dream ever last night. I dreamed that it was like the end of the world and I had to grab just a couple of my things and go find shelter. But then we ended up just going to my grandpa's house. I can't really describe everything that happened. And if I did, you would probably think there's something seriously wrong with me. Lol. But it was so realistic. When I woke up this morning I thought it was real and I even looked out the window to see if everything was still crazy. I think maybe I should call The Dream Doctor whatever his name is. Hahaha. I wonder what that dream was supposed to mean...

Anyways. I am sooo excited for tonight! Amber is having that party. Not a whole lot of people are going but it should be really fun. Veronica is inviting her friends from Buffalo, which is nice. :) We shall see, I guess."

twenty-four hours ago.
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with you.

Twenty-four reasons to admit that I'm wrong. 
With all my excuses still twenty-four strong. 

But see I'm not copping out
When you're raising the dead in me.

Oh, I am the second man
Oh, I am the second man now
Oh, I am the second mad now.

And you're raising these twenty-four voices
With twenty-four hearts.
With all of my symphonies in twenty-four parts.
But I want to be one today
Centered and true
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with you.

I want to see miracles 
To see the world change
I wrestled the angel
For more than a name
For more than a feeling
For more than a cause
Singing spirit take me up in arms with you
You're raising the dead in me."

In Algebra and French I almost fell asleep. And on the bus ride home I almost fell asleep. I had to work again tonight, so I couldn't take a nap after school. Wow, today was pretty frickin boring. I told Amber to have a party on Friday. That would be really fun and I need to have some fun this weekend. 

Oh yeah, on Saturday, I talked to my grandma. We were talking about the sex offenders living in our area and she said, ""Well, these days we have to worry about sex offenders, but when I was little we had to worry about gypsies.""
I don't know why, but I thought that was just really funny. It's kinda sad though, I wish that was the worst thing we had to worry about instead of freaks who try to abduct little girls and masturbate in front of women."

Now, I've never had him for a teacher, but I've heard enough stories to hate him like everyone else. But yeah, I was just sitting there when all of a sudden Mr. Harmoning walked in and sat right down next to Gohman!!! I just about DIED! (He's my gym teacher by the way.) Ugh, that was pretty uncomfortable, as you can probably imagine. 

Well, after school today I went over to Amanda's house. Not a big deal, it's just down the street. I told Andy to tell Carlon that I was going over there, not really thinking it was a big deal. But of course, it's my mom, and of COURSE, it was a big deal!!! I just got bitched at by her. I really don't even care anymore. I'm old enough to have all the responsibilities she lays on me. So why can't she treat me my age in other ways? She trusts me as much as she would if I were 10. God, I just get so sick of all this bull shit."

It was cool, I haven't talked to her in a while. Nothing really exciting happened. I got both of my tests back and I'm very proud and happy to say that I did very well. I got a B on my algebra test.And then I got a 52/51 on my bio test. Then I found out I'm getting a 100% in the whole class. That kinda blew me away. Not bad, not bad...

Then I got home, and sat around and watched tv. I've been so frickin lazy lately. I went downstairs and Andy and I kinda talked for a while. It's really nice when we get along. I have to admit he can be pretty cool sometimes. He makes me laugh...hahaha...."

I had two tests today, one in Algebra 2 and one in biology. I think I did pretty good on both of them. But who knows. I always think I do well on math tests and then I pretty much fail them. I really hope I did ok. Tomorrow I have a test in French on the STUPID Napolean video we've been watching. I'm getting so sick of that class. AND to make matters worse, I just found out I'm getting a C in it. 

But anyways. I worked today with Jeremy and we sat and talked shit about Jen, as usual. A really cute guy from PacSun came in and got some water. He was really nice too. We were talking a bit. :) I hope I see him again next time I work.

Then we bought stuff at Hollister. I got a sweatshirt and a long sleeved shirt. I also got two shirts from Aero. But it was really cool because I haven't seen Karen in a while and we haven't gone shopping togethre in FOREVER! She is seriously like the best person to shop with. She gives me her honest opinion on everything. She's not afraid to tell me the truth, I thought that was kinda cool. 
 
Then we went to Caribou. She had a gift certificate and she was like, ""I wonder how much money I have left on this."" Then she went to pay for her coffee and the guy was like, ""Um, there was only 46 cents on here."" It was SOOO funny! Haha, I guess ya had to be there.

"event","Wow, today was pretty amazing. I only went to school for A-block. Then my aunt Amy picked me and Andy up from school to go to Sharing and Caring Hands. We both needed tons of hours of community service for school and confirmation. So yeah. Sharing and Caring Hands serves homeless people food everyday, and that's what we went down there for. I had to serve people desserts. Oh man. I felt so bad for some of these people. Some just seemed so sad and stuff. There was this one girl who was probably in her early 20s that had this look on her face that made me want to give her a hug. I don't know, I just can't explain it. Then there was this one guy who came up in the line and then he grabbed 5 cookies. Later he just came up to where I was and grabbed another huge handful. It was crazy. I was completely shocked when he did that. And then some people smelled terrible! I swear, as long as I live I will never forget that smell. It was like they just bathed in urine or something. I almost gagged But some people were really sweet. Like the crazy lady. When we got there, she was sitting at a table having a conversation with herself. It was pretty funny. 

Later, after we were all done serving and everything, we had to wipe off the tables. It wasn't something that I really wanted to do since a lot of the people sitting at the tables were kinda scary. But I went over to this one table that didn't have very many people sitting at it. I went to the end and there was a group of younger Mexicans there. Yeah, they were all like, ""Hey, what's your name?"" and ""Como estas!?"" It was kinda funny but gross at the same time and I just walked away. 

It was all a pretty interesting experience. I'm so thankful to have a nice warm house and food. Seriously people, go to school and get good jobs, don't be homeless!"

But then, there's a certain someone in that class. Uh hem, hem. I thought I didn't like him anymore, but during class I kept thinking about him and stuff. WHY!!!??? I'm supposed to be over him and whatever. It's never going to happen, I know this now. I'm so sick of boys! They really really suck! And I'm sick of being alone and being frickin boy repelent.

Then I went to work and Meghan and Jeremy were there. They are my favorite people to work with. It was pretty slow, so we just sat in the back and talked. Everytime someone would come in they'd be like ""Not it!"" so then I had to go help everybody. But one time, these two guys came in and one was ok, but the other one was REALLY cute!!! So I got them their stuff then I went back to the back room. When I was there, Jeremy's just like ""Erin, which one was cuter?"" And I go definetly the one with the blue shirt. And they were like, yeah, he is. Then Jeremy goes on to tell us about the times when he had ""pretend boyfriends"". And I was like ""AH! He's my pretend boyfriend!!!"" So yeah, I have a pretend boyfriend now, and he is sooo hot! 

Then we were talking again, and Jeremy said he's never made a parfait before, and I said I haven't had one either. So the 3 of us made one and we all picked out our topping and shared it. Later, we made a ""Puke Shiver"". We made it with cotton candy and sorbet ice cream. Then we put strawberries, reeces pieces and peanut butter cups, m&m's, and gummy bears in it. It was the nastiest thing ever. Lol, but it was funny. Ahhh...good times, good times. I don't think I've ever laughed that much at work.

I hung out with Nicole and Chels during SNAP today. It was fun. I usually go to SNAP by myself so it was fun to b.s. around for once instead of sitting by myself and doing homework. Tonight after school my mom and I went to the bank so I could cash my check. I wanted to go to Target to buy stuff. She wanted to go to Barnes and Noble too so she could get something. So, we went to Maple Grove but ended up going to Borders since I had a gift certificate there. I've come to the conclusion that Borders absolutely sucks. B and N is waaaay better. Well, we were at sucky Borders for and HOUR and then we finally left. Then we drove all the way back to go to SUPER TARGET! MY SWEETEST PLACE IN THE WORLD!!! Seriously, I could live there! I bought my stuff and a present for Molly. I also saw my cousin Annie. She was registering for her wedding. OH! But ya know what I bought! Two softlips chapsticks! YEAH! Amanda has some stuff that smells like skittles. It's the shiz! So I bought that and strawberry sherbert. Al used to have that and I always used to use it. When I put it on tonight I thought of her. Awwww..... 

Anyway, I had to type my second rough draft for english tonight. We are writing personal narratives on our most important trait and the situation that made it so important. I did my family and my parents divorce that made my relationships so strong. Well, let me tell ya, writing about that is not an easy thing to do. In our first draft we had to make sure we had tons of details and whatever. So, I did. And there's a lot of stuff in there that I've never told anyone about and that's what made it so hard to write, because I knew people would be reading it and finding out this stuff. I don't know. Its hard to explain this I guess. But when I was reading over my last draft I was just thinking, ""OMG, Mr. Frickstad read all this stuff about me."" Ugh. It's just a very personal paper. While writing my first and second drafts it made me want to cry. So I'm in a very weird mood right now I guess. But I'm listening to music which is making me feel a little better. Hmm... jeez. I sound like I'm just talking out of my butt now. Sorry. I think I'm just gonna go. Later."

   Then Andy, Amanda, and I walked to the bus stop and it was FREEZING!!!! BRRRR!!!!! I got to school and stuff and went to geometry. That is the worst class. It's sooo boring it literally hurts! I can't even keep my eyes open. While in that class, I realized I didn't do this big history assignment that was do today and now I feel really dumb. Grr... I'm trying really hard to get my grade up to an A in that class and now I'll have to work even harder. That really pisses me off. I have history B-block, and it's an okay class. It's usually not too boring, but today we had to take a ton of notes, so it kinda was. Lunch was after that and that was the highlight of my day because we had
                CORNDOGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOOOOOVE corndogs. They are the best food ever. Last summer, during the month of August, I ate corndogs almost everyday for lunch. It was heaven. Seriously, anyone who doesn't like corndogs is crazy. CRAZY, I tell ya!!!!
   English is after lunch. I looove that class. Even though I usually almost fall asleep. Haha. But I'm going to miss it next semester. I like the people in that class. Especially the girls who I sit by. We were actually talking about that today. There's a lot of fun people in all my classes. It's gonna suck next semester because I won't have anybody. Well, not exactly.......(keeheehee).

But it won't be too bad. I like the girl I'm working with. And we close at 6 now instead of 7, so that will be really nice. But yeah. I'm going now. I'll write more later if anything interesting happens."

"event","Hey,
So this is my first entry. That's cool. I don't really even feel like writing anything tho. Haha. I've been on the computer for a long time and I'm getting really tired. So yeah, I'll write more tomorrow."

Even IF I slip up and bounce back to 200 at least I know I can drop it off with some (OK its not easy) discipline.

Dont worry...I'll be back to being all shy and introverted in a bit.  Just having a YAY moment."

"event","I've decided that LiveJournal just isnt a regular habit I'm ever going to get used to.  Rather, I get distracted for months on end, change computers, and remember at some point ""AH!  I have this journal that I'm working on.""

Let's see...news...

Crazy back specialist is thinking I have Fibromyalgia.  Like I need THAT like a kick in the head.  But I've been absolutely crazy past three months workin on pain management.  Diet, exercise (lost 20 pounds, plan on shedding 15 more), chiropractic, acupuncture, supplements, positive imagery, heating pads, hot baths, massage, MORE exercise, drugs, a new bed...

And it still hurts.  Every day.

Fuck.  HIV is ten times easier for me to manage than this; I can't get a grip on it.

Was playing WOW the past few months with the new release of Burning Crusade and some RL friends who asked me on board.  But WOW is getting stale for me again and City of Heroes is interesting again with Issue 9 and Inventions...sooo...may be dropping one for the other real soon.  Running both MMOs currently.  Also got back into Magic:the Gathering card game.  Used to play over ten years ago, moved, sold out of it, but wanted to meet other folks in real time who liked games and had a new friend re-introduce it to me so have been pursuing that with some vigor of late, too.

Some of the guys who play are suprisingly woofy...I guess geekdom has finally grown up to include the studly gaymer.  Who knew?  And I seem to have misplaced the journal or board for city of heroes bears when I switched computers.

Works been very very busy, and I'm taking on some new projects for sexual health outreach in our local community, doing a forum presentation at a couple universities, teaching some classes, doing my regular full time counselor gig...whew!

Past three months have been very ""giving 110% effort"" for me.  Usually motivation is my sticking point, but right now, its welcome (if exhausting).

Oh, and I'm a redhead now.  Go figure."

I love this man more than anyone, he's the most important person in my life--and up until recently I thought we could (and did) talk about anything.

So suddenly being left out in the cold like this is really making me anxious like crazy.  I do NOT deal well with uncertainty.

My pillars of support are my spirituality, my friends, my work, and my love.  Smack one of those out from under me, and my table goes all wobbly.  I don't need a wobbly table, dammit!"

"event","Well am playing EVE Online for a while again.  I did the trial last Fall but couldn't wrap my head around it--very complicated.  Seems to be working out for now, though.  If nothing else, its the kind of game where I can do things away from the computer for extended periods while I let my ship travel through space.  That takes a long time.  And at least I can post in LJ while I wait, too.  What a novel concept.

Haven't cancelled my City of Heroes account though--I'll be back to that soon enough, just needed a break for a while."

"event","The first viewing left me stunned, sort of emotionally wrecked.  The second viewing left me with a much greater appreciation for it, how subtle and layered the whole film was.  There are so many nuances that just get missed the first time around.  I don't love the movie any less, but I have a greater appreciation for it, and more sympathy for all the characters portrayed, who are truly all victims of their circumstances in one way or another.

The feelings that chase me around the second viewing are a little different, too, than the first.  I find I'm a little angry with the character of Ennis--""Dammit you stubborn muleass, you coulda had a good thing and Jack tried and tried but no you were scared and so Jack had no choice to to try and grab what rest of his life he had left but probably was too desperate, too obvious, got noticed, and got killed.""

Did Jack finally ""give up"" waiting for Ennis?  The signs are there, with him planning on bringing Randall up to his fathers' ranch, their last fight and what is said, the way Jack watches Ennis as he drives away for the last time.  So I'd have to say, yeah...he did.  Not that he wouldn't have changed his mind if Ennis decided to live instead of just survive, but he said it himself:  He couldn't make it on a couple of high altitude fucks per year.  Not just sexually, but emotionally.  

By the way, I don't hear anyone mention him but I loved the bearded actor who portrayed Randall (played by David Harbour).  He's sweet and handsome and funny and kind of soft spoken adorable and you know I don't blame Jack one little bit for tossing a lasso his way.  And actually, Randall makes the first move by inviting Jack up to the boss' cabin.  Personally I think Randall's damn hunkier than Ennis, who's much too tragic (and clean shaven) for my personal tastes.  There are at least a zillion fan fic pieces waiting on the Jack/Randall relationship alone I'm sure, because its ALL speculation.  

I love Ennis' daughter Alma, Jr.  Simply adore her.  She's Ennis' Angel, just as he describes her.  Her last scene with Ennis is just so priceless.  The way she looks at him, and the way in the earlier scene when she was talking to Cassie about how her daddy wasn't ""the marrying kind"".  She knows exactly what her father is -- exactly -- and never loves him any less because of it.  Unfortunately, I don't think Ennis sees that she knows and still cares.  He only see's people who know and judge him harshly; the same person he probably sees every morning looking in the mirror.  Which is another subtlety of the relationship between Jack and Ennis.  Jack loved Ennis and accepted him, and Ennis could actually accept himself for a little while whilst in Jack's presence.  Its the only person with whom he could let his guard down a little, but even Jack has to often fight to remain inside those walls.

Another thing that was really more clear on the second viewing was the attraction between Jack and Ennis was building from the moment they met in front of the trailer looking for work.  Neither quite knew it yet, though.  Ennis was being very tender to Jack, too, in his own rough-hewn kind of way that he probably couldn't identify.  Ordering soup even though he never ate it himself, and offering to go up on sheeptending watch for Jack.  And just the ways that they would watch each other a little longer than was strictly necessary.  Notice that Ennis almost always averts his eyes or hides behind his hat with everyone else unless he is mad at them.  But Jack...Jack he looks at.

Jack has figured out he is different and knows it; he's accepted it to a greater degree than Ennis.  Jack's the one who murmurs ""its all right, its all right"" over and over and gently comforts a scared-and-confused-as-Hell Ennis the first time they make love (not have sex, which is a different beast altogether, and was definitely partly due to the alcohol).  While neither come ""out of the closet"" during the movie in the accepted context, Jack at least can self-identify as being gay.  Though its an open question if Jack eventually may have ""come out"" because of Randall's availability and Ennis' unavailability.  

Jack, I always felt, marries Loreen for convenience--he's sort of golddigging and its not very nice of him.  Even when they dance together, you can see the expression on Jack's face--he's thinking of Ennis.  Ennis marries Alma to escape, but never does and eventually resigns himself to ""standing it, cuz he can't fix it"".  Of course, he can once he and Alma divorce.  Jack knows it, and thinks that Ennis finally figured it out, but of course no...which is why Jack is so devestated afterwards.  And, from there, I'm not sure if they have another happy moment together, really.  That's the point at which I think their relationship sadly turns into only a memory that they try to keep in a bottle year after year.

OK I think my extended thoughts on this are written out of me for now, maybe more later."

"event","Things in articles like this really piss me off  http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds27460.html

Just because some of the things that are said are totally hateful, dismissive, wrong -- stuff by ultra conservative organizations like this is what creates the film's culture in which there are no ""winners"" and no ""heroes""; everyone is a victim--everyone loses.  

But it just makes me want to SMACK em...hard!  Then do it again!  Or drag THEM behind a pickup truck or beat THEM with a tire iron and say ""SEE? This is what its like!""  Remember that Christ guy who was mocked, tortured and crucified for daring to come up with the novel idea of treating one another decently?  What, don't you even understand your own friggin RELIGION???  (I'm Wiccan by the way, so more's the irony).

How do you try to convince someone to just leave you and yours the FUCK ALONE when they want you DEAD???

Comparing ""Narnia"" and ""Brokeback"" is like comparing--well, I have no idea but its stupid.  Its not a zero-sum game!!!  Why not just enjoy BOTH for the totally different kind of experiences they bring?  But, no...that would mean they would have to actually set aside a preconceived notion or two for a little while!  Silly silly idea.

And notice how NO Conservative organization spoke at ALL about the atrocity of dragging a man and torturing him to deal and then showing your KIDS the BODY just to make a POINT?!  Instead they are whining ""Don't despoil our sacred IMAGE of the COWBOY"".  HOLY SHIT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Part of me wants to say ""Their outrage is no less intense than mine"".  Fine.  That empathetic, understanding counselor side of me can just go and have a seat with a nice cup of tea because, right now, the outraged side of me is in charge and he's PISSED."

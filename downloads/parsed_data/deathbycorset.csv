Denis told me just to take a step back and let things happen for a little while, stop trying to figure everything out and just&nbsp;enjoy it before its gone.
he is&nbsp;right. so i am trying so hard. but when the hurt resurects its painful and icky and i lose control.

i dont want to not care but i feel like i am masking my real emotions, thus being fake and such.

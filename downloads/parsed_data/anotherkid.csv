I'm officially a salesman, sucks but whatever, i needed a ""better"" job. I sell kitchen appliances and i know everyone that reads this knows me some how or another. so, if anyone thinks this is funny or what not, how much funnier would it be if i came to your house and actually did a demonstration on our products and how they work in front of your parents in a nice shirt and tie? i'm sure it would be ""hilarious"" as some people already told me. but no joke, i need to practice my presentation in a ""friendly"" environment were i know someone in the family, so if anyone thinks that your parents would just see my presentations, they don't have to buy anything cause i get paid whether they buy or not, so that doesn't matter. All i need to do is just come to your house and show your parents, so if you want a good laugh, get in touch with me or reply back. I'm not joking, i will come over and do it, cause i need this so badly. so i'm serious! 

anyways... I met the singer from poison the well, but was too shy to shake his hand. That guy seemed a lot shyer (if that's a word) then me. Guy was maddd chill."

"event","well, in this past week i have bought 4 three cd's. Here is the official review of these albums. No other reviews matter, if i like it, the album must be good. 
New NOFX album = amazing, everyone must get
New Alkaline Trio = Garbage, has like 2 good songs on it and they aren't even that good.
Dedication by Raised Fist - Awesome cd if you like straight up hardcore, sounds like stretch arm strong, but a lot faster.
Slick Shoes - Slick shoes - Cool cd, everyone should get. Great pop-punk band from Cali with the west coast feel. It's not crappy east coast pop punk. Check them out.

There you have it, if i like the cd you should buy the cd.

We are finally done with our cd, but it's not ready to get ""released"" yet. we still have to master it, mix it, and press it. We are mastering and mixing this thursday, and then we have to do the art for the cd. So we are hoping to send the cd out next week and get the cd out by late June. That is the earliest."

"event","show was cool. getting on that stage and seeing hundreds of people just looking up at you is a little, woooo. we played to a sold out crowd and all, but it really put us down that we had to play first. met a few people had fun talking to them and we got a good response on message boards and stuff. sold a lot of merch. i had a fun time except for when catch 22 went on. Other then that, sorry to the people that came after we played. peace yo"

"event","John, shit man, that is the funniest thing ever. That guy needs to shut the fuck up and needs to stop sucking the trombone players dick. what asshole those 2 are.

anyways, our show saturday night is cancelled/postoned. They decided to let us know the week of the show so that we get screwed out of a day to play. They said the cops closed the place down. I just think they are full of crap. nice of them to let us know though so early. the catch 22 show is still on for this friday night. if anyone wants tixs, get in touch with us asap. i don't know how many we have left. Well, practice later tonight. looking forward to that. later boners!"

"event","super natural forces? i think after this you will.

i was home alone and was upstairs in my room. all the lights were out except for my room. I decided to take a shower so i turned off my lights. So it was completely dark upstairs. I was thinking, ""i should leave a light on so i don't get freaked out by the darkness when i walk out."" so i turned on the light in my room. I took a 20 minute shower. I get out of the shower and the light in my room that i left on was out. I git freaked out. i checked all the closets in my house and shit. I stood in the center of my room for like 5 minutes just looking around. My dad came in and i asked him, ""did u go upstairs and turn off my lights in my room?"" he said, ""no i just got home.""  

there you have it. I always believed in all that super natural ghost stuff but now i do so even more. There are friendly ghosts who just, ""keep things in order"" like check out after people. I remember in third grade or so we went on a field trip to some church and the director person said that that place was hunted. He said people have seen lights go off inside the church when they were left on during then night and he mentioned other crap. so i guess i brought back something with me that day. well, my room is haunted so beat that!"

"event","today has officially been one of the worst days in a long time. sooooo long!! and full of bitchy people. ok.

School in the morning from 8-11, cut 11-12 class. Went to work from 1-6:30. Since the store is located in the heart of larchmont, u have to put up with all the larchmont moms who can't control themselves when it comes to having sex. They have like 10 kids running out of control picking their noses and asking their mommies questions like, ""mommy, what does the word ""sale"" mean?"" goooooooddddddd!! at about 5pm, i turned into an impossible person to deal with. I was just so sick of the day and my boss telling me to do this do that, don't forget to do this. He must of given me 5 things to do in a matter of 30 seconds and each thing took like 30 minutes to complete. I so could of gone down to the bronx and bought some nose candy today. that would of set me straight and 6' feet under i bet. stupid druggies. After work, i fucked around for 2 hours, got some essentials, and dug my car out of the snow so i could drive it. Then at 8:30 i had to start a history assignment which was given 2 weeks ago and is due tomorrow morning.  why do i procrastinate you asked? it's because it's the only thing i'm good at. so leave me alone! It's now 11:09 and i'm still not done..... and missing friends!!!!!! fuck, i'm out!"

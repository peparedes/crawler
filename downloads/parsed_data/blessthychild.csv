"event","wow. its been so long. altho im still a lurker. not much has changed. just me being me. ive been working 10 days straight and im a bit tired. im ready for a day off and that wont come until friday. im trying not to get too depressed but this monotony is starting to take its toll. or maybe ive just reached a new level of depression already where ive just become numb because thats how i feel. i dont really care about anything anymore nothing seems to make a difference to me. my whole world could collapse and i dont think i would blink once. my parents divorce is not really going well. i havent talked to my dad in weeks and every time i talk to my mom with out fail she tries to brain wash me into hating him. and its the most agravating thing. shes got me by the balls with her threats, her blaming me for lack of compassion, and the constant feeding me thoughts of abandonment. her emotional warfare on me is wrong, and theres nothing i can do about it. im an atheist.

Just a Thought - Gnarls Barkley

All i want is your understanding
as in the small lack of affection.
Why is this my life, is almost everybodys question.

And I've tried, everything but suicide,
but its crossed my mind.

I prefer peace,
wouldn't have to have one worldly posession
but essentially Im an animal,
so just what do I do with all the agression?

Well I've tried everything but suicide,
but its crossed my mind.

Life is a one way street ain't it,
If you could paint it, I'd chalk myself going in the right direction,
so i go all the way,
like i really really know what the truth is, im only guessing.

And i tried everything but suicide,
ooh but yes its crossed my mind, just a thought.

It's even dark in the daytime
it's not just good, its great depression.
when i was lost i even found myself, looking in the guns direction

and so i tried, everything but suicide,
and yes its crossed my mind
but im fine.

""hey im an audio engineer""lol but yeah. im dead broke no money at all and it sucks. i need to start working and making money. im tired of just sitting around and not being able to work. cant wait to go back to daphne for like the 2 weeks that ill be there and see all my old buddies again.

i just finished my final for WS (workstations)and i gotta go back and take my lab test at 5pm here in 2 hours. i think i kicked this tests butt and the lab will be easy as a DOO DOO PIE also. my next class is sound dynamics which is going to be fun cuz its all about setting up for a live enviroment. 

i had a weird dream last night and another one yesterday when i took a nap. it was really really strange. but it was one of those dreams where you wake up and you remember what happend but then five minutes later you cant remember for the life of you what it was about. im concerned that it had some symbolistic meaning behind it but oh well. 

thats about it"

Lake Forest closes teen club over songs
Residents objected to lyrics of music performed at the Dox
Saturday, June 18, 2005
By DAN MURTAUGH
Staff Reporter

DAPHNE -- A popular teenage hangout and concert venue run by three 18-year-olds in Lake Forest has been shut down after residents complained about the content of some of the music played there.

Residents said they were disgusted to learn that bands that played songs with such titles as ""Big Bowel Movement in the Little Town of Bethlehem"" had played at the Dox teen club.

Prompted by those concerns, the subdivi sion's board of directors voted 4-3 Thursday night to close the club, which is situated in a small building at the end of Country Club Drive, next to Lake Forest's tennis courts and swimming pool. 

It's on a residential street but the closest houses are a few hundred feet away.

More than 9,000 residents live in more than 3,200 homes in the north Daphne development, making Lake Forest Alabama's largest subdivision.

Not all residents were happy with the decision. Some said the Dox was an alcohol-free, smoking-free venue that gave Daphne teenagers a safe place for weekend activities.

Further clouding the issue was the fact that Lake Forest Property Owners Association Board President Mitch Davis is the father of one of the club's managers, Andrew Davis. Sarah Coxwell, another board member, is Mitch Davis' daughter.

The Dox houses video game machines, a snack bar and a stage and sound system for concerts.

Run by recent Daphne High School graduates Andrew Davis, Benji Meloun and Chris Browning, it's about a year old and averages about 100 people at its once- or twice-weekly shows, according to Meloun. (Chris Browning is not the son of Fairhope's police chief, who has the same name.)

The three charged $5 per person to attend the show, and split the proceeds with the bands, according to Davis. 

The shows are advertised as being open to people of all ages. At a recent show, most of the attendees were high school age, with some people in their 20s and one woman -- the mother of a band member -- in her 40s.

At Thursday's property owners association meeting, which a Mobile Register reporter was barred from attending, board members Willie Robison , Ray Drake, B.T. Cocke and Henry Lawson voted to close the facility.

Davis, Coxwell and Ed Kirby voted to keep it open, according to several people present at the meeting. 

Lawson said several residents at Thursday's meeting spoke against the Dox, and none spoke up to defend it.

At the meeting, residents brought several printouts from Web sites of bands that had played the Dox. Included among them was Roman Gabriel Todd's Beast Rising Up Out of the Sea, a band that had played the Dox four times since November and was scheduled to play again in July, according to its Web site.

The band's songs include ""Big Bowel Movement in the Little Town of Bethlehem,"" ""Nativity in S---"" and others with titles that some may find offensive.

Another band was Fry Cook, which lists among its songs one that refers to male genitalia and another titled ""Playing in the Doo Doo.""

""The primary reason they were shut down is the bands they were bringing in were violating community standards and rules of decency,"" Lawson said.

Meloun said those bands aren't representative of all the acts the Dox brings in. He said that the Dox's last show before being shut down featured two Christian bands.

He said he and his friends would have liked the opportunity to respond to the complaints about the vulgar bands and to compromise with the board. 

 ""We could get rid of the vulgarity, we could go as far as to ask for a band's lyrics before booking them, but we can't do that if we're shut down,"" Meloun said Friday.

Mitch Davis said he felt that a lot of the problem was generational.

""I read some of these lyrics, and it's awful stuff,"" he said. ""But in the 1960s, when I was kicking around, people said what Jim Morrison and the Doors wrote was pure trash. 

""People think these kids are swayed by a punk spitting out vulgarity, but they just look at it as another freak show.""

Lake Forest had been trying for about 10 years to turn the building into a teen center with little success, according to Mitch Davis. About a year ago, Andrew Davis approached his father and told him he and his two friends wanted to try to run the center, according to Mitch Davis.

Davis referred the three teenagers to Lake Forest General Manager Jake Bodiford, who let them use the building free of charge so long as they maintained the building and kept it smoke-, alcohol- and drug-free, Davis said.

The teenagers brought in video games, snacks and a pool table, Davis said. A few bands got in touch with the kids and asked if they could play at the center, and soon the teens had shows scheduled almost every weekend, Davis said.

Meloun said the first couple of shows only brought in a handful of people, but it has since grown to an average crowd size of 100 for twice-weekly shows.

""It's gotten much bigger than we expected it to,"" Andrew Davis said.

It also became more problematic.

According to Meloun, residents complained about people speeding, parking in people's front lawns and people making too much noise in the parking lot outside Dox. Lake Forest recently paid for an off-duty police officer to hang around the Dox during concert hours to help keep things in order.

Daphne police Capt. David Wilson said police never had any problems at the Dox that led to an arrest. He said, however, that police were beginning to log calls about the content of music played there.

""We just recently started receiving complaints from neighbors in that area about the number of bands, the type of bands, and the number of young kids coming into that neighborhood,"" he said. ""I believe that some of these same folks started complaining to some of the board members of the Lake Forest Property Owners Association, and they dealt with it.""

Meloun said he hopes the Dox saga is not yet over. He said he is trying to gather as many Dox supporters as he can to attend the July 21 board meeting and protest the decision.

""Our whole point is we provide a safe and secure environment for teenagers to have fun,"" he said. ""To my knowledge, it's the only place like that in Daphne, that's one reason we're trying to fight to keep it open.""

i think ive reached that breaking point like many of you have about this hardcore music scene. basically ive truely come to realize that hardcore is a fashion now and its not about the music anymore. people are becoming too concerned with their little social groups and their clothes and their whole persona that they are really becoming just like everybody else who they claim to hate. ive become more annoyed at these people who wear their mosh hats and look sad in all these pictures and have ironicly grewsome names for their screen names that almost seem poetic. i seems like some of these people just apply like a ""hardcore"" formula to their lives and then presto chango like magic they are hardcore. dont get me wrong tho there are still people out there that are true that always have been and always will be. the music is starting to sound the same to me now. all these bands have the same thing in common, breakdowns and little upbeat two step parts with witty little melodys. the bands that i think are taking it to the next level and making something differnt and making new ideas are zao, norma jean, and the chariot. if you listen to these bands their new records are a lot different than what everybody else is playing now. but i guess im not going to talk all this crap and not talk about myself. ill admit it i do kinda fit into this ""hardcore"" stereotype w/ my hardcore band shirts and some of the music i wrote fit into the hardcore song formula. but the band shirts i do wear i do believe they are true and original and i dont write only hardcore. i also play blues and other genres. my myspace doesnt have some lame poetic yet grewsome tital and my pictures arent of me looking sad or hardcore. arrg. i dont know im just sick of this. yeah i think im done.

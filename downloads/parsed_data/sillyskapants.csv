"event","so for the most part everything has gotten better. 

i had a giggily day today.

work was work and was lame like always, but i ate good free food.

sitting outside of the train station before i walk to my internship made my day. 
This homeless guy just starts growling, and saying ""what what"" to/at absolutly no one.

oh yeah and before that swillis had this silly site posted in his profile. the stupidest thing ever but it made me giggle a ton.
http://www.cryingwhileeating.com/

then when i was waiting for my train back home i made friends with Craig. the homless guy, really nice, and really really really drunk. he wouldn't stop talking to me but it was cool. he told me to stay in school, asked me how old i was like 7 times, told me i was pretty, almost started crying, offered me alcohol and i refused to take it- he asked me that like 3 times, a whole bunch of stuff.

then while i'm still waiting for my train, but trying to get abreak from craig for a min, this kid askes me for any spare change coz someoen stole his train ticket or something. so i gave him $6.

THEN i come home. have an awesome good lovey dovey phone call with Trevor

Then i end up hanging out with Pirelli for about 2 hours, just driving around doing nothing but laughing and telling stories. haha i love that ""older brother"" of mine. I love it. he's cute, but we have been friends fo soo long that we don;t even remotly like eachother that way. :) we can hang out and do whatever and there is no attraction or lust or anything! so he is pretty much a girl to me. i love it! :) he is aweosme. 

i think i will always be confused about everything. :/

and now i am going to sleep, coz i have a massivly busy day tomorrow that starts at 7am. I'll be in boston for most of it, but the sucky thing is is that i have no clue when i'm going to get home, i know the earliest i'll get back to franktown is at 730pm, but i made plans to hang out with trevor tomorrow, but i don't know if i'll have time. i have to work, and intern, and go to school for a lecture. awesome.  i guess we'll see.

oh yeah.... movie day / night whatever on saturday??! anyone else in?? maybe order some EXTRA LARGE pizzas??? hmmm?? ya wanna?? yesssss

k. bye."

"event","It all started yesterday @ My nephew's b-day party. The poor kid had too much junk food to eat and i picked him up and hugged him. He started crying his eyes out for soo long, then he threw up all over my sister. I was so embarrased. I felt so bad. THEN Anthony wants to go into boston and go over Pat's apartment and he wants Trevor and I to go with him. I didn;t really want to go, but i ended up going anyways. So we take the train in at 6:30. On the Train I was getting a little aggitated with Trevor, but nothing big. When we got there we had to walk about 25 min. to his place. No one was there besides Pat and his roomate Sam, and Trevor, Anthony, Hopper and I just sat around for a while. Once it was time for us to leave everyone else showed up. So we leave his place at 11pm. the train we needed to catch is at 11:20. We got a little lost, then found the Orange line which we waited for for like 15 minutes. THE ORANGE LINE SUCKS. That was the last train out, so we got stuck in boston for the night. So we start walking back to Pats place and we firgure we can take a cab all the way back to franklin for $80. We didn't do that but later regreted it. SO we go to the Bk Lounge to get some food and while we are eating everyone in there turned towards the window and was talking about someone getting shot like right outside BK. I didn;t hear anything, but when we were leaving we saw the whole crime scene tape up and cops everywhere. So after that we took a cab back to Pats. (firt time i ever rode in a taxi by the way) We got there and then had to wait outside for him for 20 mins. But Jeff Paul and lynch came by so that was good. Soo Trevor and I are exhausted when we get up stairs and go right to bed. WE SLEPT IN A FUCKING CLOSET. HARD WOOD FLOOR. my sweatshirt and Trevor's sweatshirt were are pillows. At least we were lucky enough to get a blanket from Pat. Yup. deffinatly couldn't sleep. well I could a little, but Trevor didn't get much sleep. I was pretty drunk so i just passed out. SO yup. hahah um... we are gonna skip the next part coz it's stupid and embarassing.. (haha ok...i peed myslef again. stupid beer)(OH YEAH I COMPLETLY FORGOT.. NAK IF YOU ARE READING THIS... when we were walking to Pat's we have to walk by Berkley haha and all i could think of was being stupid and saying "" WHAT'S UP SEE YOU IN CLASS""  :) haha ) SO we wake up at 6:30am. We attempt to take a cab to the train but no one would stop for us. so we get to the Orange line and we wait forever and a year again for the fricken orange line. SOOO we get to the train station and were all set to take the 7:20am Franklin Train. THERE IS NO FREAKING 7:20am train. The earliest train that goes to Franklin on Sunday is 11:20. We read the schedule wrong. TREVOR AND I HAD TO GO TO WORK. I was suppose to work at 7:30am and he had to work at 8. i had to call out even though there is no one to replace me, and he had to call them and tell them he'd be there later. TREVOR AND I GOT STUCK WALKING AROUND BOSTON FOR 4 AND A HALF HOURS. It was freazing, we were both exhausted, my feet and knees were killing me, BUT on the other hand it was kinda nice. Atleast the sun was out and we were together and not alone.  SO after we walk for an hour, We go to a different BK lounge and get cheap breakfast. I was so hungry, but that just made my stomache ache a lil. THEN we finally have an hour left till our Train comes. We are sitting in the Back Bay Train Station and Trevor is sleeping, I'm trying to make myself comfortable, and i'm not smiling. This really nice sweet old lady comes over to me and asks us if we are ok, and if we are sick and need any money. hahah She was so sweet, and then trevor wakes up in the midst of all that and the lady starts crying. She said are u sure u guys are ok, U (trevor) look just like my son, a spitting image. He passed away 2 years ago. Then she turns and walks away crying, and we are both like.. ummmm wut can we do? she was so sweet tho. THEN Trevor is in the bathroom and i'm waiting for him outside.I see this old guy at the bathroom mirror with a cane and a huge gash on his head. He's looking threw the TRASH for paper towels for his head. Trevor asks him if he is ok and the guy says. I just fell on the escelator. the guy had a concussion I guess and was bleeding everywhere so trevor told the commuterrail people and they were getting him an ambulance. Then our Train comes and we get to go home. It was a very uncomfortable ride, but we finally got home around 1pm. And the whole time I was in Boston i needed a tampon soo bad and i didn't have one. it sucked. I was never so excited in my life to be home and to be able to take a shower. :)  
Now I am going to take a very long nap. :)"

<TR>
<TD>Based on the results of this test, it is highly likely that: <BR><BR>You prefer your romance and love to wild and daring rather than typical or boring, you would rather pursue than be pursued and, when it comes to physical love, your satisfaction comes more from providing a wonderful time to your partner than simply seeking your own. <BR><BR>This places you in the Lover Style of: <B>The Liberated Lover</B>. <BR><BR>The Liberated Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and forms the kind of free-thinking, sexually-exciting, self-confident lover that society once condemned but that a liberal-mind cherishes and exults. The Liberated Lover is a treasure to find, though it can sometimes be difficult to do so because they are often already engaged in relationships or are in high-demand if ""in the market."" <BR><BR>In terms of physical love, the Liberated Lover is possibly the most thrilling and demanding of all, with the one potential drawback being that it is possible to feel 'overmatched' at times by their prowess and selfless giving. Given trust and understanding, and the right lover, the Liberated Lover can be a delight in bed. <BR><BR>Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Exotic Lover (most of all) or the Carnal Lover, or the Suave Lover. <BR><BR>Congratulations! <BR><BR>If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback!

"event","i have enough crap to deal with. i don't need any extra added stress.

I'm sick of being the little sister of everything. 

girls are never going to stop talking about eachother ever/not tell people things.

feeling somewhat replaced at the moment is a getting to be a usual feeling for me.

i finally got a cell phone tho!!!!!!!!!!!
so i can finally get in touch with everyone again!!!

AES is stupid, it has nothing to do with me, it should NOT effect my grade. sorry i don't have an extra 200 dollars laying around. i'm still going to get a career.  sorry i don't have an extra $20 i can use just to get me to school so i can sit there for an hour and a half for a lecture about audio. not a class. a lecture. and not get home until midnight. and then work the next morning at 7:30am. sorry i don't have $22 just to be in AES. sorry i work EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I""M NOT IN SCHOOL. 

I work Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays.
I go to school Monday all day, and Friday.

i get on the train at 7am on friday just so i can make it to my 9am class. RUSH HOUR. 

i actually kinda like school this semester. but it just makes me so angry sometimes. the expectations are just stupid. sorry i have a life other than school. i know they mean well, and they're trying to get me a job?? even though i get it myself.

i need to have an internship by monday.
no pressure.

i'm still in debt.

I look like vitamin C only with a red face.

ok i'm done. 
thanks. ;)"

They are even letting me take physics even though ther is this huge ordeal with that caz my algebra teacher fucked everything up for me, but i need physics to grauate. My first class on Monday, Industry seminar was overwhelming. i liked that class, but i got so scared. it wa a totally reality check for me coz that class is preraration/shoving u right into to ""real world"". scary at first. but i think i'll deal. Then after almost giving up, I ended up ACTUALLY LIKING MY RECORDING 2 CLASS, haha me lke my actualy major, AUDIO CLASSES?? WHAT!!! SOMEONE SHIT ON THE COATS!
so all is going well. and i can't wait to graduate this december like i was suppose to last May. 

welp i gotta go call work, maybe take in a lil' cat napie before Gilmore Girls comes on. haha laugh all u want. i friggen love that show. hardly ever watch it, but i'm home now and i just love it. :P 
anyone else out there even like that show?? haha coz i know like 2 other people besides my self that like it. hah thas it. KIM ARE U SO EXCITED LIKE I AM FOR THE SEASON PERMIER TONIGHT!!?? ahha I am. 

did i really just go on that long about the gilmore girls?? ......i'm sorry.

A lil' recap.
Friday night?? haha or saturday i can't even remember. Tay, Chris, Trevor and myslef went to the drive in and saw Wedding crashers and 40 yr. old virgin.  wedding crashers was funnier and i thought it was gonna be the other way around. haha oh well they were both good movies. :) awesome night. met chris for the first time. nice boy, but totally not for taylah. 

Sunday Night got to see my practially other family.. the HUTTS!!
My friend Kelly who I haven't seen inforever put on a show in Mansfield, so Tay and I went. haha deffinatly not for the music at all but to see her and her brother Patrick. AND i got to see their lil' sis Tori, Their step dad, their Gram, and step dad's rents. AWESOME!!! I MISSED THEM SO MUCH!! I WAS SO HAPPY I GOT TO SEE EM!!!!!
hahahahahaha  we only stayed for like an hour maybe?? but the last band we saw was the funniest thing i have ever seen before. It was this like emoish-hardcoreish stuff that actually sounded kinda good for like maybe 1 count of 8. When they first started playing the 2 guitarists and the bass player all synchronized their jump and the way they made love to their guitars. haha it was so riduculous. they looked seriously like retarted robots. we started laughing out loud and a couple of kids who were sitting to the side and foreward to us looked back at us. SILLYNESS. 

ok now, i'm going to call Julie from work, then clean up a lil bit, eat some din din and watch GG!!"

apparently i have bad credit. that sucks. i owe cingular 188 dolars. thas it. i just haven't paid it yet coz i thought it wouldn't do anything. i went to go buy a new phone last night at verizon and in order to get a phone i need to put down a deposit.... a deposit that i get back, but still. really stupid, really insanly large deposit....... of a fucking $1000!!! yes 3 zeros. thas disgusting. it's not like cingular can't afford to run thier business without my $188. it's not like they don't have a billon and 7 other customers that pay a shit load a month just to have a cell phone. but because of my measly $188 i have to pay ATHOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET A PHONE?? how does that make sence. i'll pay the freakin 188. that better take away the whole deposit crap. if it doesn't then i'm gonna be more pissed.

today is a girlie day with Lydz and Tay. i need this more than anything right now. i'm so sick, my teeth hurt, i'm confused about school haha AGAIN. i have shitty credit, i'm trying to save up for a car but a but load of crap just gets put in my way. wut about CHRISTMAS?? so i'm tryign to save up for a car and an apt. but then lydie had to get preggers and freakin married to a guy no one wants her to marry.. let alone the fact that the guy is fuckin 36 years old. yeah. she's 19. i think i'm gonna throw up.   so now i have to pay for a dress, a wedding gift, a bridal shower, bachelorette party?? a baby shower, tons of shit for the kid, Christmas presents, a present and a dress for my sisters wedding and wedding shower, bachelorett party, $700 in bills. yeah this sucks. PLUS money just to get to school and home, money for books, school stuff, School itself. yeah only my mom and I are paying for school. AI fucking a million dollar school. need about 7 jobs right now. i thought i was on the track to getting outta debt. i was all set with just paying off my credit card then getting a car. that was my plan and it was gonna work. after i got my car i work more towards an apartment. then i could move into boston and be all set. 

i seriously feel like something is telling me never to get a car. i seriously feel like i'm going to die in a car accident. there has been soooooooooooooooooooooooo many times that i had the money to buy a car and was going to, then randomly outta no where something would come up, or i'd have to pay off a bill first or haha buy an apartment. it's just so werid.  nothing likes to work out that well for me does it???

grrrrrrr. haah welp. atleast i got a little more hours at work. if only i could get another job, then i wouldn't worry so much. 

i need coffe like no tomorrow and then it's off to hop in the showah.

everybody in the freakin world has their own car. why can't i have one?
if i can't get another car for 6 months at least?? then fuck it. i need one by spetember. in 6 months it's not even gonna matter.
what the fuck. everyone has one. it can't be that big of a deal. why do i have to have ""established"" fucking work credit or what ever the fuck it is. if i have a full time job and will be working forever then why can't i have a fucking car.
i am the only person i know that has a liscence but no freakin car. what the fuck.

ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

i'm going to nh sometime before september and i swear i'll freakin steal a figgen car if i need to.

why the fuck does it have to be so friggen expensive??



i'll seriously never ever own a car. i guess i'm just not allowed to. i can't believe i blew off all of the couple of times i could have had one. every time i had money i bought a friggen  apartment,laptop,or HOUSE. what the fuck. 

can someone point me in the direction of a car for sale or a dealership, that will give me a car with harldy any miles on it, can get me back and forth from boston every day and really really cheep.  
:) haah if anyone can pull a miracle outta their ass, there it is.

there are so many friggen things i need. 2 of them as soon as possible... an apartment and a car.
i'm never gonna get them am i? 


:) k. thanks. sorry. i'm done.


guess what i'm doing today? looking for about a gazzilion more jobs. my job is ok, but it's starting to get on my nerves. there is no need for debbie at work, she just gets in the way. she is probably fucking the owner or something thats wut we all think. i need a job to replace this one and i need like 3 other ones aswell. 

i go back to school in 5 weeks. that means i can work full time and waste the rest of my summer for the next 5 weeks. after that when am i gonna have time for work? like 2 days a week is when i will. fuck! 

i'm sure i'll figure everything out.

going to school (an hour away) and interning (an hour away) is gonna mess everything up. i need to work full time. haha this is gonna be so hard. :(

there are a ton of people who go to work full time, go to school full time and intern. OH MAN. i totally give you guys all the freakin credit in the world. 
dunno how u do it, but i'll figure it out come septemeber coz i'll be doing the same frggen thing.

"event","ok, i guess i'll start with my dream last night.. weird byond weird. i'd try explaining it but i don't even think i know how to. 
the people in it were the weirdest part. 
the main person in my dream was a kid that i knew from elementary school to highschool, but we never talked outta school, and we didn't even really talk in school. i kept calling him a different name to, which was a name of a kid also from school, but i'd call him the other name, but i would say his name right after it, like it was a mistake i said it. haha i dunno. 
My boss, The ""manager"" person at work, my friend's mom and her aunt were all in it. 
(the manager person, my friends aunt and mom were all pregnant?? i think and wearing black dresses.
they seemed like bad guys of the dream, but i remember i ran by them and gave the all a hug and was crying??) haha i dunno  
I was in it, some weird cute white animals were in it who kept popping up from the walls of the house, a yellow cab was in it, some black guy who had powers like Mr Fantastic and i guess his kid were in it, haha i dunno, it was such m messed up weird dream. haha it was so weird that i didn't even wanna get outta bed this morning. haha i just wanted to keep dreamin and find out wut the crap was going on. 

THEN later on today, I hung out with lydie and just had crappy luck. I broke a PLASTIC jusice bottle in the store. It fell outta my hands and broke in to 2 pieces. haha A FREAKIN PLASTIC BOTTLE. I got attacked by masquitos, and i can't even remember wut else happened but it was just a weird feeling, bad kinda crappy day. We did get slurpies tho and go see her sister's play. hha which was out in the middle of no where. in a creepy creepy place, her sister's call their school. 

Then i'm on the phone with trevor and i got kinda mad coz he did something that he didn;t think was bad, and really wasn't, but it was just adding to why i was angry with a friend. haha i dunno man. everything today was so werid. I didn't like it. 

EVERYTHING WAS SOOOOOOOOO INSANLY FRICKEN HORRIBLY WEIRD TODAY!!!!!

i hope tomorrow isn't like this!!

i work tomorrow morning, then maybe out with lydie and tay???

i need to get in a better feeling state before i go to bed. haha i CANNOT feel like this tomorrow!!!!!!!!!

hahahah AHHHHHHHHHHHHH why was today soooo weird?????????

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Hippie</B></FONT><BR>You are 14% Rational, 100% Extroverted, 14% Brutal, and 28% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Hippie! Characterized by a strong sense of extroversion, irrationality, gentleness, and humility, you no doubt frolic through fields preaching peace and love to all! You are probably either very spiritual or needlessly paranoid about ""the man"", like most hippies, as a result of your focus on intuition and feelings over cold, brutal logic. You are also very, very social. And like any hippie, who would have no qualms about hitchiking across the country just to meet some interesting people, you too love to interact with others, even complete strangers. Because we know most any hippie is peace-loving and humble, it stands to reason that you, as well, are terribly gentle and humble, almost to the point of revulsion. Your carefree attitude of peace and harmony is probably very, very sickening to realists or cynics or anyone who isn't a hippie, to tell the truth. In short, your personality is defective because you are overly emotional, extroverted, gentle, and humble--thus making you an annoying hippie. And you listen to psychadelic rock and smoke a whole lot of pot. Okay, maybe not, but I wouldn't be surprised if you did.
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational. 
<P>2. You are more EXTROVERTED than introverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I> 
<P><B>Compatibility:</B>
<P>Your exact opposite is the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=0&score2=100&score3=100"">Sociopath</A>. 
<P>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=0&score3=0"">Hand-Raiser</A>, the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=0&score1=100&score2=0&score3=100"">Televangelist</A>, and the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=0&score2=0&score3=0"">Robot</A>.

<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way.

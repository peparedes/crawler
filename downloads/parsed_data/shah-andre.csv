Tomorrow is the first day of class for this session at VSU, but I won't be among the participants.  It's been a process coming to the decision (gradual, mind you), but I've decided not to go forward with Education as a career goal.  That determination overturns my previous decision to return to VSU for an M.A. in Education.  I'm still in Valdosta, still trying to figure out what to do, but the next apparent step for me is to hone my skills on something palpable that can help me get a good job that I'll like.  This requires more school, but this time not at VSU.  After finishing there, I'm now on my way to the local technical college.  Three cheers for low tuition and (more) financial aid--as soon as I get it.

I guess I'm coming to the realization a bit late in the game, as it pertains to receiving a college education, but the point (ultimately) can't be just to obtain education in the abstract.  As great as learning is, and it <i>is</i> great, it cannot exist in a vacuum and purport to do much of anything good for you.  <i>That's a generalization</i>, you say, <i>and learning can do a great lot of use for someone, even aside from anything you could quantifiably measure.</i>  Maybe so, but the bits I learned about pedagogy and my ability to say (poorly and brokenly) <i>je ne sais quoi</i> aren't paying my bills.  Why?

I don't have a job, or a career, and I can say it's because college, in the form I experienced it, didn't really put the tools in my kit to make it happen.  I got the wrong degree, or, more likely, I got a perfectly good degree with no way to use it in the form I received it.  Honestly, this is something for which I have only myself to blame.  What did I honestly expect to do with a B.A. in History other than teach, if I wanted to use my degree?  History is one of those nebulous topics, like philosophy or religion, that you can't really do anything with it as a career other than to teach it to others.  Other than that, it doesn't <i>do</i> anything.  And what are jobs or careers?  They are continual acts of <i>doing</i> or <i>making</i> things.  You can't <i>do</i> history, and although you can literally <i>make</i> history, that doesn't count, as it is only an idiom and not a widget.

I suppose I should have recognized the quandary in which I now find myself several years ago, when I decided (almost by default) to major in history.  I did it because I was out of core classes I could take and felt I had to pick <i>something</i>, and History sounded good, since I was immensely interested in it.  I still am, but I could have also pursued an interest in astronomy, computer science, or, had I the courage, mathematics instead of History.  I'm interested in those topics still, and I think any one of them would have given me a better shot at landing a good job to start life.  Not that I knew that then.  I couldn't bear the prospect of taking classes I wouldn't be able to use for credit later on into my college career.  Maybe that rationalization is evident in that out of the 125 credits I had at graduation (120 required), the only 5 I couldn't use to graduate were: a PE class I took twice, for fun, and a French class that repeated what I had learned in high school.  I just took that so I wouldn't have to work hard while I was on my study abroad in France.  Muses, forgive me.

That fear of doing work that wouldn't be credited led me to choose too soon without thinking ahead.  Picking a major is indeed a momentous occasion, and in retrospect I can see how so many people changed their minds about what they wanted to spend their lives doing once or twice, or thrice a semester.  I should have left History as a hobby and majored in something I could <i>make</i> or <i>do</i>.  That's now where I find myself, on the road to remedy that grievous error.

Thus, as I head off over the next week to get transcripts together to apply to a school that everyone in the state is eligible to attend, recognizing that I will not be special among the student body of the technical college (whatever my previous academic pedigree at Big Brother University), and finally understanding what the purpose of education unfortunately, in reality, <i>is</i> (that is, a means to an end, the end being to be able to make a buck to pay my bills), consider this a cautionary tale five years in the making, and four years too late.  See you guys (and you know who you are!)  soon, in the labs of technical colleges across the state, as you find your Academic-Heavy/Widget-Light University Degrees fail to please the men and women holding the keys to your future, looking at you from across their office desks, clipboards and questions in hand, wondering why in the hell you majored in Metaphysics and Argumentation, and, more incredibly, why you think you're qualified to work in their company.  To those who find yourselves in this position, or on the way to it, I wish you the best of luck.  Or, if that isn't available, at least better luck than I've had.  I'll be in the CIS lab at Valtech if you need me."

"event","I was back on campus at VSU a bit ago, and it felt nice to be there.  I've begun the process of gathering paperwork and motivating myself for a return to class, and enjoying the experience on campus is a good start to all of it.  I'm planning on taking graduate classes in the fall, to get a M.A. in history.  At the same time, I'm going to be taking classes leading to a Teacher's certification so that I'll start hearing back from the schools where I apply to teach.  My impetus for going back to school (aside from being compelled to reside in Valdosta a while longer until Monica graduates) is that I can't find a job that I like, pays much of anything, or has much of anything to do with my degree at the moment.  Without something like that to occupy my time, I might as well spend the time productively seeking an advanced degree that will (hopefully) pay off down the line.  If nothing else, at least my education will cease to stagnate as it seems to have over the past year since I graduated.  I've learned some about life, I suppose, but as far as actual learning and enlightenment, that quest has been sidetracked, not least by my increasing tendencies toward laziness.  So, this return to campus is a good step for me, I think, and I'm looking forward to the endeavor with optimism.  I couldn't wait to get out of school before, but now I'm going to be glad to be back."

"event","Hello world.  It's been a while since I've posted, and I blame having a full time job and slowspeed internet connection, along with just never having time.  Thus, in my hour of need, I return to my journal and send out this missive, to those of you living (or with friends/contacts) in the Atlanta area.

I'm going to be taking a job working for the state House of Representatives in the next week or so, but I have to have somewhere to live before I can actually accept the position.  As I have no current residence in the Atlanta area (being actually still in Valdosta), this presents something of a problem for me.  I need to find a place to stay for the next few months.  Specifically, from mid-January to (about) the end of March, when this current legislative session ends.  I don't require glitz or glam, I'm house trained, and I don't require much space.  I do need somewhere to sleep, somewhere to put my things, somewhere to shower, and I will pay rent.  Hopefully not too much rent, as I will not be making much money working for the legislature.

So there's the dilemma I face.  I'm very excited about the opportunity I have to work in the state government, but I'm going to need some help making the logistics of living in Atlanta work out.  Again, this is a short term situation, going only through March, so I'm willing to be as flexible as I need to be in order to find somewhere to stay.  If you can help, it would be much appreciated."

"event","The Constitution is the most fundamental safeguard of the rights Americans have.  To amend it to restrict the rights of any American is a gross and explicit contradiction to the protective spirit of the Constitution.  It is not up to government to decide what is or is not moral and to thereby attempt to legislate morality for the nation.  It is the collective will and beliefs of the people who decide morality, whether people share or differ in their interpretation of moral values.  The government has no role in this issue, to attempt to speak for the people when the people have not united for the express purpose of granting government such an authority to act.  Congress is empowered ""to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof"" (Article I, Section 8). However, finding that the Rightist agenda, nay, the Rightist crusade against homosexuality does not fall under this ""necessary and proper"" clause of the Constitution, the current irresponsible and politically capitalistic effort is the Republican party's response.  This is wrong, and must be stridently opposed.  I, for one, will never submit to a regime of hatred or discrimination, and one would think that the leaders of our country would refrain from such bigotry as well.  The Senate must recognize the importance of this vote, and what it says about the leadership of our nation.  Are we to be a progressive nation, determined to protect the rights of all Americans, or will we show ourselves to be regressive, backward-looking, and intolerant of the values held by our fellow Americans?  During the current Republican era, America has not fared well when it comes to preserving the sanctity of civil liberties.  This is a crucial moment, and we must not fail to stem the encroaching tide of liberty crushing legislation.  The Senate must vote against the proposal.

I urge you to contact your senator prior to Wednesday's vote, either by email or by phone.  You can make a difference.  Even if your senator has already decided his or her vote, which is likely, it makes a difference when the public makes its will known.  Then, there is no denying what the American people really feel, whether the Senate acts with or against the public's accord.  If there is dissent, there must be a record of it, and to do that, we must make them hear our voices.

To find your senator, go to <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/"">http://www.senate.gov</a>.  Phone numbers and email contacts are available on the senate website."

"event","Hello everyone.  It's been a month since I've posted anything, a slight delay I'm sure.  This is just a brief notice of where I've been in that time, if you didn't know.  I've been in England and I should have had a post to that effect sooner, but what can I say.  Livejournal hasn't been my top priority.  I have a detailed record of everything I've been doing, but it has chiefly been in email correspondence that won't be made available for public consumption.  I'll suffice it to say that I've seen a lot of fun things here in East Anglia, castles, towns, cities, markets, historical stuff, modern stuff, museum stuff and all of that.  I've enjoyed the European Football championship, even if the French squad met an untimely end.  I'll be returning to the States on July 9th, and my reception will be warmly attended at Hartsfield.  I'm looking forward to being home and seeing my friends again, even if I'm no longer a resident of the City of Valdosta.  Everyone enjoy the next few weeks, and I'll check back in when I've returned.  Cheers."

"event","I feel like staring at the wall for a few hours.  Anyone care to join me?  It feels like a <i>find something to do, please!</i> kind of evening.  What do I usually do on Sunday nights?  I'm already tired of being unemployed and out of school.  I need something to do.  I feel like there should be a test I'm supposed to be studying for (well, there's always the GRE...ha).  But there really isn't anything I have to do, and I'm not used to this.  Thus, I'll stare at the wall for a while.  I hope I'm able to sleep tonight.  I'm going to be miserable tomorrow if I can't.

I had a good time today.  I went to the <a href=""http://www.floridastateparks.org/ichetuckneesprings/default.asp"">Ichetucknee River</a> with Monica.  She hadn't been before, I hadn't been this year, so it was a good time.  But since when is it supposed to be that crowded before Memorial Day?  Not that the loud people ruined it or anything, because they didn't.  I just like my river to myself--I like my outside time to be quieter than that.  But the other people were having fun too, so I can't hold that against them.  As usual, I packed way too much stuff in the cooler, but I guess it's better to have too much than not enough.  At least I'll still be drinking cold sodas and water tomorrow.

Speaking of tomorrow, I start my weeklong gig of hosting my little bro in the morning.  Harley is out of school now and doesn't leave for summer camp for a week, so I'm the beneficiary of his company.  I like hanging out with him.  He's always fun, and he's not a handful at all.  He'll probably spend most of the time playing Xbox.  I just need to remember to put my Grand Theft Auto games away before he comes.  Leann was a bit put off before when I bought him a copy of <a href=""http://ign64.ign.com/articles/163/163960p1.html"">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a>, so letting him play GTA would be a poor choice on my part.  I think it'll be fun having him around, plus it will give me something to do.

On a final note, depending upon if I get my deposit back on the apartment soon enough, and how much my final pay check from VSU is worth, I may actually be able to pay off my whole credit card bill before I go to England.  That's huge for me.  I won't have to worry and fret about being in debt while I'm gone.  I'm almost certain that I won't have enough spare funds to actually have a surplus as I go, but at least I won't be significantly indebted (or in debt at all)....meaning I can use my card a bit while I'm abroad and not panic about doing it.  I'm sure I'll have a bit of debt going as I make the move to Athens in August, but that was to be expected.  If I can find a job quickly, it won't be a major concern.  So things appear to be on the up and up, for the time being.  Anyway, I'm going to stare at the wall now."

"event","I'm in Nashville for the moment.  I'm going to stay over here tonight and go back to Valdosta sometime tomorrow if/when I get out of bed.  I'm tiiired.  Laying insulation in the attic is tough work.  I itch from the fiberglass and I'm sure that my breathing could be better, but I'll probably be fine tomorrow.  I know Dad and Leann really appreciated my help.  Maybe it'll be cooler in the house here now, when summer comes in with its full wrath and heat.

As for me, I'm now officially unemployed.  I worked my last day in the Media Center today, and as much as I've hated that job at times in the past, it was almost with a tinge of regret that I walked out today.  But not quite.  I'll probably miss my coworkers, because they've been a good group of people, but it's time to move on.  I've learned a lot from working there and it's paid the bills I've needed it to while I was in college (wow...past tense?), but it's time to move forward.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to get a job immediately, so it's going to be on a rather tight budget that I move closer to my date of departure for England, and it maybe be even tighter when I return.  I'm not sure how long it's going to take me to find a position in Athens when I get back in late July, but it better not take too long or I'll have trouble making rent in August.  Graduation--out of the frying pan, into the fire.

Now, as to my status for the present, I'm kind of in limbo, and I'm putting other folks in limbo, too.  I was originally planning on moving out of my apartment this week upcoming, but I have a few reasons not to.  First, if I move out, where am I going?  To Athens, while Phil is in Maymester?  That makes no sense--nothing to do up there right now.  I'd rather not move back in with the family because, as much as I love them all, I'd probably quickly get bored at home (ie...lots of xbox and xbox).  So I guess I can stay in Valdosta and at least try to find something to do for a while.  Good luck there, though.  Reason #2 for not moving out: I've yet to take (or sign up to take) the GRE.  I can't get into grad school at UGA without doing this.  I need to get off my can and do it.  I mean, the June 1st deadline to get all my paperwork in is fast approaching.  Although my desire to get into grad school for the Fall semester is on the wane, I don't think it would hurt me to be ready just in case I do end up wanting to go then.  It's just better to have options, something I won't have if I miss that deadline.  Have to take the GRE.  Reason #3, I'm more motivated to stay in Valdosta all of a sudden.  This part would go in a private entry, though, so for all of you...=P

I still think I'm going to Jacksonville at the beginning of next week.  I talked Mom into going to St. Augustine because she hadn't eaten at one of my favorite restaurants before.  Laura, Chris and I ate there on Tuesday (at Harry's), and I think I've converted the two of them into fans.  Anyway, If I can score another trip to the beach and a free meal off Mom, I won't turn it down.  I'm looking forward to it.  Just have to make it through the weekend first, and I've already done the hard part putting in the insulation tonight.  It's all set for good times the rest of the weekend.  Have a good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

As a curious side note, this is the third consecutive year I've had a project like this due on this weekend of the year.  The last two years, they were long term papers for Dr. Byrd.

"event","I haven't written much lately because I haven't had the time to, but as I approach today's 5:00pm deadline (which I will fail to meet) for turning in my history senior seminar term paper, now is as good a time as any to reflect on some of the recent events in my life.  Why am I doing this now, instead of working on my paper?  One: I have no chance of writing a 25 page term paper in the next hour, and, Two: The gods certainly smile on me because I've been given a reprieve until Friday morning, 9:00am to hand over said paper.  Meaning that I won't have to beg for an Incomplete (or worse) at the end of the semester.  But enough of that for now.  There's real business to discuss.

< aside>That attitude, really, is what has put me in the situation I'm in with my class work.  I've noticed that during this semester, I've ceased working purely as a student on this campus and have spent more time and effort acting as an agent <i>of</i> this university.  What this has done to the time I normally spend working on academics is obvious, hence the mess I've been in at the end of the semester with sizable portions of my class work remaining incomplete.  If I have failed on that front, though, I really think I have done well in the areas where I <i>have</i> invested my energies.  It's too bad that those areas aren't specifically why I am in college.  But I think that my efforts at governance and pseudo-administration have prepared me for whatever my future holds, just as my in class studies have.  I cannot, then, say all the time I've spent in these efforts has not been productive.  < /aside>.

Back to the topic at hand (no, it is <i>not</i> Dissent and Desertion in the Civil War South</i>...I'm telling you, wait until Friday morning!), as anyone on the VSU campus knows, there have been some real problems in student government.  I wrote about them significantly in some recent posts (Begun <b><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/shah_andre/47898.html"">April 21st</a></b>, completed <b><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/shah_andre/48199.html"">April 22nd</a></b>), and <i><a href=""http://www.valdosta.edu/spectator/"">the Spectator</a></i> also did good work reporting the issues.  Coming into last night's senate meeting, I assumed that the proper proceedings would begin, and the senate would handle the problems as we should have.  That's where my expectations were apparently flawed.  You see, I was under the impression that we had our stuff together, that we could work together, and that we could resolve the issues.  I'm still trying to figure out how I could have been so wrong.

I'm not talking about a failure to do something about the problem.  That was bad.  But what happened last night was <i>ugly</i>.  I've seen some bad senate sessions during my year in office, but this was like Cirque du Soleil next to a county fair, in comparison.  For starters, I had never seen so many people crowded into a session before.  Had I known who these students were when I arrived, I would have probably expected the outcome.  Let this serve as a warning to everyone: anytime Greeks suddenly visit an official meeting where they have not previously been active, be forewarned that something ugly is about to erupt.  I wouldn't say things were as bad as Siegfried's Roy getting mauled by the tiger, but the picture of Ike beating Tina certainly seems fair.  Why did you do it, Ike?

 <b>Here's what happened.</b>  The session made it through the officers' reports without a hitch, but the room was full of people expecting something.  We all knew what was coming.  Someone in the senate had to say something about last week's elections debacle, and the someone on the agenda to do that was the Public Relations Committee (PRC).  I was also on last night's agenda, but I didn't get my turn because the Public Relations Committee's business set everyone off.

The committee report began with Travis Simmons, the chairman, giving a detailed overview of exactly what happened in last week's election, duly noting the clear violations of election bylaw that several candidates committed.  That's where things began to get heated, and when I realized that all the students in the auditorium were Greeks.  The findings of the PRC were that there was sufficient suspicion of voter fraud to legitimize overturning the election and holding a new one.  Enter Keith Fleming, our current SGA Comptroller, incoming Vice President-elect, and Greek.  He began a defense of the elections on the basis of very technical arguments.  Try to follow me here, because this stuff is obscure.  His argument was that <b>the PRC did not have the authority to bring the charges of voter fraud to the senate</b> because, get this, the Public Relations Committee was <i>not actually an official SGA committee</i>.  Think about that.  An executive officer of <b>your student government saying that a <u>standing committee</u> did not actually exist</b>.  Upon what grounds, do you ask?  SGA never actually voted to affirm any of the committees that have been working this year.  OK, so what?  We forget a procedural item and, as a result, none of us have any authority to do anything?  What kind of statement is that?  If he has been aware of this problem, why not have said something about it months ago, to make our work ""official""?  The argument was pure bull, but the senate played his game.  We motioned and passed a statement declaring all current committees to be official, and that all actions previously taken unofficially to be retroactively declared official acts of student government, as per the requirements of the SGA bylaws.  Thank you, Keith.  Shut up and remain silent.  We were busy trying to fix the problem he and his ilk created.  I guess it's like a corrupt player to play by corrupted rules.   But I digress.  Back to the narrative.

After we satisfied Keith's arcane complaint, we moved back to the PRC's presentation.  Realizing that our Constitution is severely dated and that its status was a primary contributor to the election problems, the idea was for the PRC to make some suggestions to the senate regarding what we could do to fix the problem, and how to go about holding a new and fair election that could not be affected by voter fraud.  <b>That was when the Greeks attacked.</b>  Our Greek senators took exception to the charges that the fix was in on the elections, and began what effectively amounted to a filibuster, whether they intended it or not.  Anytime someone tried to continue the official senate debate, a Greek senator who opposed whatever point was being made would declare that a ""point of order"" needed addressing.  If you know about parliamentary procedure, then you know that points of order involve some question as to the parliamentary proceedings of a meeting, or to some other point that needs addressing to facilitate the continuation of the proceedings.  A point of order is <i>not</i> intended to allow someone to interrupt another speaker while he or she holds the floor.  But that was how the point of order was used last night by our fine Greeks.  But it wasn't just the senators.  It was the students who also interrupted, Robert's Rules of Order be damned.

Obviously, <b>when parliamentary procedure breaks down, all hell breaks loose</b> when a contentious debate is going on (hence the title of this post, if you've ever seen the Aussies' parliament debate something fiercely...they stand on top of tables and shout at each other a lot).  With the students in the back being unruly, and with their fellow Greek senators being only slightly less obnoxious, it was not long before some of our less patient senators lost their cool and got angry as well.  With charges of wrong doing flying back and forth across the senate floor, declarations of innocence, declarations of ""you damn sure did do that,"" and not just a few demands that order be restored to the senate by any number of people (including myself), the scene devolved into madness.  It was really Ike and Tina, not Bert and Ernie like it should have been.  Anyway, after a few minutes of things staying way out of control, and after the PRC tried to renew its position holding court over the discussion so they could continue with their proposals, students started walking out, and some senators stormed out.  The meeting was officially (or unofficially) closed--I don't remember us voting on it, but maybe we did.

I had not had my turn at the podium to discuss what I had come to discuss.  I'm planning on doing it at next week's meeting, and I think my topic will be just as timely then as it would have been last night.  If you missed my <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/shah_andre/49399.html"">last post</a>, that was what I had intended to say to the senate. (Btw, I amended my speech before the senate meeting.  The revised version, which I will give next Monday night, is on my website <a href=""http://www.valdosta.edu/~raboyd/docs/sga.proposals.4-26-04.doc"">here</a>.)  With the meeting blowing up before I had my say, I gave my copy of the speech to the editor of <i>the Spectator</i>, T.A. Glanton, who said she would run it in this week's paper.  Whether they post it in print or online will be up to them, but I gave them full authority to print it and hope they will.  I think it will serve as an ironic and potent condemnation of SGA's behavior, since the topic of my speech was about communication in the SGA, and how we are generally failing to communicate our message to the student body.  I think that this last meeting has communicated a message very clearly, just not the message we wanted to send.

The point is that we have a long way to go to fix our problems, and that everyone seems to be more than willing to just fight about what we've done wrong and about who is to blame rather than deciding how we're going to fix our problems as a group.  I think that most of the people in the senate are more than happy to just pass off these problems to the senate for next year, and want to just let it go for now.  These are our elected officials.  This is the type of representation I have come to expect.  <i>Aren't you glad you have student government representing you so well?</i>  I know I'm not.

EDIT:  I forgot to mention that the College Democrats/Republicans debate went very well.  I think the Democrats cleaned up, if not only because the Republican positions were clearly stupid, then because most of their cheers came from people <i>hurrahing!</i> for party posturing rather than any good points the debaters made.  I was disappointed that there weren't more foreign policy questions, though.  I think we could have raked Bush's lousy policies over the burning coals more than we did, but I think we clearly won the debate.  That was just my perception from on the stage listening to the crowds' reaction to the various points.  I kept score for a while, but I gave it up once I took the stage.  Anyway, thanks go out to those who made it to the event.  I appreciate it."

"event","You can read or not read, I just thought I'd post the speech I plan to give at tomorrow night's SGA meeting.  It has nothing to do with the election scandal, so if you were wanting something juicy about that, well, you're out of luck.  I think that this is a good message, if a bit incoherent, but effective enough at giving my opinion of what our student government needs to work on over the next year.  Enjoy it, if you want to read it.

<lj-cut text=""It's all about Communication."">
<blockquote>Communication is a major issue in student government.  Without good communication, we have problems as individuals and as an organization.  Individually, if we do not talk to each other about what is going on inside the organization, we are not able to work together and efficiently do the tasks we need to do.  As an organization, if we are not able to do the jobs we are supposed to be doing as well as we could be doing them, we are letting down the students we are supposed to be representing.  Furthermore, if we are not communicating effectively with students, they will not know what we are doing, or are trying to do, in student government.  This could lead to the impression that we have an ineffective, inactive organization.  I think this is the impression the VSU student body probably has of us right now, but I don't even know that for certain, because I have failed to ask.

I will acknowledge that I have not done my utmost to help inform the students on this campus of what I have been doing during my time as a senator, so I am part of the problem in our general communications failure.  Recognizing that you're part of the problem has to be the first step in dealing with that problem, whatever it is.  I don't think that anyone here can honestly say that they've done everything possible to help get the SGA's message out to students.  I know I haven't.  I've tried at some times, and at other times I haven't tried as hard.  There is a core group of people with whom I am in frequent contact that I can say I've done a good job of keeping in the loop about things the SGA has been doing, and things I've personally been involved in as a senator, but they have been mostly friends and members of other campus organizations I'm involved with.  When it comes to going out to new groups of students in a wider part of the student body, I have not taken  the SGA's message to the students very frequently at all.  My question is, have you?

I hope that you are all doing better than I am at getting out the SGA's message to the students, because that is our reason for existing as an organization.  But what is SGA's message?  What are we all supposed to be telling this campus? What is the purpose of having student government?  This has been my only year in the senate,
so I would still consider myself to be growing into the job, but it seems to me that the purpose of student government is to serve the people who elected you.  That's it.  That's the purpose of any elected position, so no matter if you won by landslide or got in like I did virtually on an open seat, your job once you get into an elected position is to represent the electorate, not just the people who elected you.  If our purpose in having student government on this campus is to serve the students of this campus, I think that the end of the semester is as good a time as any for us to try to evaluate the jobs we have done this year, both individually and collectively.  The only question that is really relevant is, are we meeting our obligations to the students?

I will not try to answer this question.  Instead, I'll leave it open to everyone here, to members of the Senate, and members of the Exective branch, to decide whether or not we've met our obligations to the students we represent.  I will say that for my part, I've tried hard, but Icould have done more, and I could have done a better job this year.  Probably a lot of us can say that.  But what I would say instead is that I appreciate the great effort put forward by many of us here in this room who have honestly tried to make a difference for the students on this campus.  Where we have failed our students, we will have to try harder next year not to fail them.  Where we have succeeded, we have to try just as hard to continue to succeed.  As an organization, I feel that the SGA should take on the question I asked a moment ago for the next year and make a serious effort to answer it affirmatively, to say 'yes, we are meeting our obligations to the students of this campus.'  That has to be the measure of progress for this assembly.

To make progress on this task, it will be necessary to improve the lines of communication within and around the SGA.  We need to do a better job as an organization talking to each other, whether it's between two committees working together on a project, or the Executive board checking up on the progress of senate committees, or individual senators working on completely unrelated projects.  The goal must be to have the people of this organization enabled and empowered to help each other
when there is work to be done, and that can't happen if there is no communication.  Furthermore, we have to do a better job of taking our message to the student body.  It's no wonder that there is such great apathy on this campus.  No one knows what we're doing most of the time, and we have to change that.  The members of this organization are going to have to get creative to improve this situation, and we're probably going to have to pass some bills once we have a plan.  But planning is easy if you take a look around and listen to what people are saying.  I have a feeling that if we listen to what the students are saying, and act on it, they would probably be the best resource we have when it comes to best being able to serve them.  That is what we should be doing, as representatives of student government.

This is our last session of the year, so we're not in a position to pass any new proposals that reach the floor tonight, but I have some suggestions that I would like to propose anyway, just to get them into the agenda.  Maybe when SGA resumes session in the fall, having some old business will jumpstart the process I've talked about tonight.

Items for review:

1.  To improve communication between SGA and the student body, SGA needs to do a better job of getting information out to students.  I propose installing permanent outdoor message boards (three-sided free-standing type) in high pedestrian traffic areas.  These boards should be maintained and monitored by the appropriate committee(s) of the SGA, paid for by SGA funds.  SGA would be able to use these message boards for whatever advertising it needed to do, whether for upcoming student events, opportunities, community events, or whatever else.  The main benefit would be that SGA would have permanently fixed locations that students could depend on to get their information.
 
2.  To find ways to improve the ways this organization can serve the students of VSU, I suggest that members of the SGA travel to other regional colleges and universities to find out some of the things being done on those campuses to provide for the needs of students.  For example, meeting with student government representatives on another campus could allow us to learn about some programs or services we do not have here at VSU that are productive and beneficial to the students of the other school.  That's just an example of what we could do, but the idea would be to see what others are doing and evaluate if it might be something we could use to improve our own campus.</blockquote></lj-cut>"

"event","I forgot to mention a few things.  Next Monday night is going to be a big night on campus.  At 7:00pm on North Campus in the Pound Hall Auditorium, there will be a debate between the VSU College Democrats and College Republicans.  It will be moderated by Dr. Jim Peterson from the Political Science department.  The format will be a 5 by 5 panel, with neither side knowing the topics or questions in advance.  This is to prevent either side from preparing statements and just reading a taylored speech.  I think the debate will foster a good discussion.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we will not be able to field questions from the audience at this debate.  However, future debates next semester in the months heading toward the November election will include more audience participation.  So, bring yourself and your people up to North Campus next Monday night to enjoy the event.  It should be both fun and informative.  I hope to personally and brutally crush a few Republicans, and none of you should miss it.

The reason for the time constraints at the debate will be because several of the participants are SGA Senators (myself, College Democrats president Rick Lasseter, Republicans' Jason Adams, etc).  I expect that we will need to hurry back to Main Campus to prepare for what is likely to be a contentious senate session.  If the Judiciary and Public Relations have moved with any speed at all, possible impeachment may be on the senate docket, and I hope to get on my soapbox in protest of generally irresponsible behavior by several members of the senate.  I'm a lame duck right now, since I'm graduating, so I need fear no reprisal.  I think things need to be straightened out, and I have nothing to lose by trying to do so.  So, if anyone can make it out to the senate meeting, that would also be good, and is in fact highly encouraged--all SGA senate meetings are open to the VSU public.

So, Monday night: 7:00pm, North Campus Pound Hall Auditorium, for the VSU Democrats/Republicans Debate. Then, around 8:00 or 8:15, Main Campus Powell Hall Auditorium for the SGA Senate session.  Everyone is highly encouraged to come to both, or either, and to bring as many people as possible.  Thank you, and I hope to see a lot of people at both."

Although the numbers will not be officially released until Thursday (later today), the information going around is that the elections weren't likely to be fair anyway, whether or not every candidate played by the rules.  The bottom line is that most of the VSU student body is apathetic about elections of any kind, especially when they don't see that the people running for office actually do much of anything.  This explains low voter turnout, and also shows that the candidate who can ramp up significant support within a fairly large group of people is going to have a major advantage in the election.  Thus, it seems so far, the incumbent president Jason Lewis is going to be named the winner of the election today in an absolute landslide.  The numbers I've heard have been rediculous, so have a grain or two of salt, but here goes:

Jason Lewis -- ~66%
Jason Adams/Nick Beard --~33%

I don't know how J.Adams and Nick finished exactly, but the margin separating them is expected to be fewer than a few percent.  Given that they each received around 100 votes, then, only a few votes separated the two.  But this is an overwhelming majority for Jason Lewis, if things hold up.  <i>66%?</i>  Incredible.  What is the cause?  Take a look at the candidate, then take a look around the campus.  No guesses?  Yep.  Go Greek.  It's how Jason Lewis got his boy John Eunice elected to the city council.  You don't need the support of the student body.  Just get the Greeks to turn out to vote.  How do you do that?  I've only heard bits and pieces of how this has happened in the past, and if anyone has ever been in a Greek organization, maybe you can help me out.  But is it asking a lot to expect that these organizations are <i>not</i> going to have a set policy going into an election?  Especially when someone loyal to their cause (Lewis) is running?  I think that's a lot to ask.  I think there is a lot of intra- and interorganizational communication (as well there might be), but I think there's probably a lot of internal organizational pressure on membership to vote the way the organizational leadership wants it to.  And that's where you run into ethical questions.

However, this is not the issue.  This isn't the big deal.  Everyone knew going into the election that Lewis would carry the Greek vote.  There was never a doubt about it.  As far as I knew, if the Greeks turned out in force, he would have a leg up on Nick and Jason Adams, which seems to be the case.  But the problem is that Jason Lewis did not play by the same <b><a href=""http://www.valdosta.edu/stulife/handbook/pages_5-12.pdf"">rules</a></b> everyone else played by.  The SGA Constitution is out of date and sorely needed the revising this year that it is not going to get (being delayed until next fall).  However, it's still the law as far as SGA is concerned, and it was thrown out the window in this election.  SGA Constitution Article VIII Section 5 points to the Election Code (Article V of the SGA Bylaws, which are for some reason not posted online) as being the relevant section here.  Specifically, Article V Section 2. e. seems to have been wantonly ignored by Team Lewis:
<blockquote>There shall be no campaigning within 100 feet of polling stations on the day of elections.  No candidate may loiter around the place of voting other than for the express purpose of voting.  No campaign worker may wear any decoration which support any candidate while within 100 feet of the voting polls.</blockquote>
While the exact definition of <i>polling stations</i> must certainly be called into question given that the elections were held online, and that, further, any person with a wireless internet connection on a laptop anywhere on campus could potentially be in the act of voting, thereby constituting being at a <i>polling station</i>, it is clear that what the Bylaws intend to prevent is manipulation of votes and voters at the place of ballot-casting on election day.  Since neither the Constitution nor the pursuant Bylaws have yet been amended in light of the new voting circumstances produced by the switch to online voting, it is to be expected that everyone particpating in the election process must try to as accurately and faithfully adhere to the <i>spirit</i> of the relevant sections of the Bylaws, in order to prevent the possibility, much less the appearance, of any voting irregularity.

Jason Lewis was seen, and I believe photographed, at a table in the middle of the morning (10:30ish) on election day.  In the photo, as described to me, were support staffers, passing out candy to passers by, with a laptop on the table.  In the background of the image, I'm told, was hanging a campaign banner for the Lewis Team.  I can't wait to see this photo, and I'll post it when I have it.  It shouldn't be long, unless the Judicial Board holds onto it.  But I digress.

(EDIT: The photos are now available online, from <i><a href=""http://www.valdosta.edu/spectator"">The Spectator</a></i>:

<img src=""http://www.valdosta.edu/spec/20040422/front1b.jpg"">
<font size=""-1"">Lewis removing one of his signs, around 10:30am.</font>

Obviously, if the scenario from the above paragraph is substantiated by the existence of such a photograph, the Lewis campaign must be scrutinized for possible (or likely) infractions against the relevant election codes--including parts of Bylaws Article V Section 2. d., stating,
<blockquote>All campaign materials within 100 feet of the voting polls shall be taken down by 7 a.m. on the day of the election.</blockquote>
Whether passing out candy is a further violation of Section f. is probably insubstantial, given the more serious apparent infractions.  Nevertheless, to be thorough, Bylaws Article V, Section 2. f. reads,
<blockquote>No campaign materials may be handed out on election day.  This does not include campus media.</blockquote>
In any case, the arguments I have established herein following from the photograph would lend serious momentum toward a judgement that the Lewis team (whether individually or collectively) are in some degree of significant breach of Election Regulations.

As the matter will certainly be investigated, the process is as follows (SGA Constitution, Article VIII, Section 6):

<ol>
<li>A complaint will be filed with the SGA Secretary (Danielle Burns)  </li>
<li>The Secretary turns over the complaint to the Public Relations Committee, who hears the complaint (PRC includes Senators Spruill, Roberson, Simmons, and Perry)</li>
<li>The PRC may initiate further action with a 3/5 vote</li>
<li>Further action would likely proceed through a Senate impeachment process (since Lewis is already an elected officer)</li>
<li>If found liable for any wrongdoing, ""violators may be disciplined by fines docked from their SGA salary to a maximum punishment of forfeiture of office."" VIII, 6.</li>
</ol>

So that is the case, as it has unfolded so far.  This may be nothing more than an advance view of what <i>The Spectator</i> might be saying tomorrow.  Or I may have been misinformed in my sources, though that is not likely.  This is just the main part of the allegations floating around right now.  There are others, such as the possibility that one campaign may have taken down signs, flyers, and/or sheet signs from another campaign (a violation, and generally poor conduct).  Also, more indirect circumvention of election rules other than the ones possibly indicated here.  Add to that the generally bitter tone of ""conversation"" going through the members of the Senate (as some committees and candidates have been in frequent contact following up on the accusations and events as they have unfolded) and it would appear that this election is going to provide plenty of fodder for the SGA's critics.  It certainly does appear that the critics are going to be right about us for a while.

After a debacle like this, I feel to see how SGA is going to redeem itself anytime soon.  It saddens me, and frustrates me to know that there are people so highly involved in the process who apparently do not care very much about the image or well-being of the Student Government Association.  Leadership is supposed to be reflected from the top.  What I've seen so far is an example of what <i>not</i> to do."

"event","Even though the crush of the late semester rush is on, there are a lot of thing happening on the campus that I can't remove from my attention.  Probably the biggest thing that is going to happen, though the campus isn't widely aware of it yet, is that the SGA is about to be embroiled in a major scandal.  We've always had a bad reputation on campus, as a group the doesn't do anything.  That reputation is rather undeserved, since the problem isn't a great lack of activity by the organization as a whole (even though it is corroded with resume-builders who don't pull their weight).  SGA often hasn't been effective in publicizing the work it does.  As a senator, I've enjoyed working in relative anonymity because I'm not here to build a resume, and I don't want credit for anything.  The problem is that, it seems, some very important members of the Association do not share this working philosophy with me.  Thus, the emerging scandal, coming to a <i>Spectator</i> near you, likely on Thursday.

As you may or may not know, the student government executive board elections were held on Tuesday.  Voter turnout appears, from what I've heard, to be rather low again as a whole, and this was to be expected, even if the margin seems to be up from last year (I believe we may have pulled about a 5 or 6% rate, which is actually good for a student election).  However, therein may lie some of the problem.

I normally love it when he tries to speak off the cuff, but tonight he put me on edge when he carelessly said something amounting to Jihad terrorists being <i>false believers</i>.  True, Jihad as interpreted by those groups of people do not walk in the true light of Islam, but an American president cannot say anything about a Muslim (of any description, Jihadist or not) in any such language, because al Jazeera will be all over it.  While I, as an American, and a native speaker of English know what Bush was saying, for the millions of people in the Arab world who rely on al Jazeera for their information, they will be subject to an unnecessary opportunity to spin Bush's words into something contentious and dangerous.  I know that Bush normally makes this easy enough, and there isn't anything that can be done for that, but this is almost as bad as when he said the fight against terrorism was a <i>crusade</i>.  Bush has to realize that he cannot venture anywhere near religion when he's shooting his mouth off.  It only further agitates a difficult situation, and must be extremely cautioned against.  His advisors will hopefully set him straight, but I'm sure this won't be the last time Bush's ingenuousness creates a ripe opportunity to further diminish American  support abroad."

"event","I'll have to say, I'm definitely interested in working for the State Department, after having heard an ambassador give three separate lectures on campus today.  I've signed up to take the Foreign Service Exam for April 24th, so I'll see how it goes.  It's very competitive, and I have no expectation to pass it right now.   I don't have the time to prepare for it properly, but I want to take it now just to get a feel for the process.  I could really see this as a career, though, because it unites some very important elements for me.  One, I really like foreign policy, and like to deal with it.  Two, working for the government is something I'd like to do.  Three, travelling abroad is very high on my list of priorities for a job.  If I were to receive a post as a Foreign Service officer, I'd have all three of those.  That isn't a bad start to a career.

<b><i>Rumor</i></b>

I've heard a few rumors from gossiping staff on campus that I may have won a top university award, but I have no official affirmation on it.  I'm hoping that the talk isn't confusing my winning the Bartram Award from the Honors Program with taking the university's top award, because that's the one I haven't heard anything about yet.  I hope it works out, though, because that will just take the cake.  Anyway, as it turns out, I'll be out of town one of the days scheduled for awards ceremonies, April 15, when the College of Arts and Sciences is having its awards ceremony.  So I've asked my family to pick up my award from the History Department for me.  I'm disappointed that I won't be there, but I knew about the Honors Conference in Wilmington long before I had a date set for the awards ceremony, and besides, I honestly wasn't going to give up a chance for fun just for enjoy an evening of self-glorification.  There's no point in that.  I enjoy that people like to give me awards, and they can give me all they want, but I'd rather be out doing something useful.  That's probably why I've never gone to Honors Day before, but this year I have to go, as there's no way around it.  And graduation should be a trip, too.  I'm sure I'm going to feel awkward wearing a sash, a medallion, and four or five cords, but that's the nature of the game.  I have them, so I guess I should use them.  Anyway, enough for now.  I've had a headache for three days, so maybe sleeping will help it go away."

"event","I can't stop tinkering with my NCAA brackets.  The field is so wide open that I think any number of teams could take the title home.  I'm not looking for a repeat of last year, with another Syracuse winning the title (mostly because I don't see any single player like Carmello Anthony in this year's field who can absolutely take over a game), but there is a good deal of parity and equality at the top of the upper echelon of tournament teams.  Obviously, some of the #1 seeds should go a long way into the tournament.  Here's my (current) thoughts on the bracket breakdown, but it's all subject to change before the tournament really gets going on Thursday.  And I'll use the <i>real</i> regional names, not the stupid city-based names implemented this season.  If you're not interested in March Madness and excited about the imminent NCAA tournament, you should get your head checked and probably skip the rest of this entry.  And if you're playing in my <b><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~shah_andre/44949.html"">Yahoo Pick 'em</a></b>, try not to steal my analyses.  You'd probably do better thinking it out on your own because I usually don't win tournament pools.

<b>Central Region</b>
I have Kentucky and Stanford penciled in to make the Final Four.  But I also think that if Georgia Tech jumps on Kentucky early (in the prospective Central Regional Finals), Tech could beat UK.  That was my first bracket draft, but then I thought that Tech could also get beat earlier by Gonzaga or even Northern Iowa in the first round, <i>if</i> Tech comes out flat and UNI comes out shooting on fire.  So because of all that, it's hard to say that someone will be able to beat Kentucky out of that Central region.  In the upper half of the bracket, I think UAB will give UK a good, fast paced game, but they won't be able to win.  Even Kansas' veritable home court advantage over Kentucky will probably fall short of beating them.  It isn't that Kentucky has the kind of great players they've had in the past, but they're good enough, and they play as a <i>team</i>, something other squads don't always do so well.  That, and coaching, is their greatest asset, and makes them so hard to beat.  If Georgia Tech doesn't play them, I don't think anyone will beat them before the Final Four.

<b>North Region</b>
Any discussion in this region probably has to take into account the #1 seeding.  St. Joseph's University, while putting together a good season in going almost undefeated, is not in my opinion worthy of a #1 seed.  Period.  They may have won every game but one, but they also didn't play anyone all season, excluding one game against Gonzaga, and another decent match somewhere along the way.  Otherwise, they beat up on a decent Atlantic 10 Conference, and destroyed a lot of nobody teams.  Clearly, I am skeptical of seeding St. Joe's so highly, especially considering that Oklahoma State is more deserving as a #1 seed in this bracket.  Okie State won the Big XII Conference title, a much more difficult task that St. Joe's beating out Providence and Xavier in the A10 (not an easy job, but certainly not like beating out Texas et al in the Big XII).  Since I feel Okie State is the real #1, I have given them the ticket to the Final Four from the North Regional.  I see Pittsburgh shaking off its horrendous 3 seeding and rising up against Wisconsin's unfair home field advantage, but the Panthers will fall to Okie State in the Sweet 16.  In what I hope is a good early call, I see St. Joe's surviving Texas Tech, only to fall against a Wake Forest team coming off a close win over my beloved Florida Gators (round 2).  Wake Forest is a 4 seed, so it isn't inconceivable for them to beat a legitimate 1 seed, and it's even more legitimate given how shaky St. Joe's is as a 1 seed.  I wanted to pencil Wake Forest into the Final Four, but I think the Cowboys (Okie State) are too strong, especially with the gift given to them this season by the festering Baylor program.  The Cowboys, along with Mississippi State, are profusely thanking Baylor for imploding, and I can't blame them.  Anyway, Oklahoma State will carry the North regional.

<b>South Region</b>
Duke is clearly the team to beat in this region, if only because of their tradition as a top flight national powerhouse, but I wouldn't try to sell this on reputation alone because there are three other teams in this bracket capable of cutting down the nets in San Antonio:  Mississippi State, Texas, and North Carolina.  Mississippi is the most obvious second option to Duke, if just because of the talented players they have, and they way they've played all season.  Duke has seen its ups and downs, especially toward the end of the season when a team wants to be playing its best ball.  Duke is not invincible.  Watching their late game collapse against Maryland in the ACC tournament was a real shocker; I was impressed by the way Maryland played as a team in making that comeback, but Duke didn't do much to stall Maryland's effort.  Duke was really exposed in that game, as they became far too passive when they should have aggressively acted to curtail Maryland's charge.  Also, they showed that if you can get a few of Duke's premier players out of the game (physically by fouls, or mentally by momentum), they are much more vulnerable and can be beaten.  Mississippi State has the players to match up with Duke and, if they exploit the same weaknesses Maryland found in the last few minutes of the ACC tournament, and in overtime, Mississippi State could beat Duke heads up, if it comes to that.  That is the conclusion I am currently predicting, even though North Carolina could knock out a very good and talented Texas team, if the Tarheels can get hot and on a run.  Roy Williams is a proven winner and hasn't had problems beating Texas in the past, when Williams coached all those good Kansas teams.  Even so, I've picked Texas to get by UNC, mostly because of how talented the Longhorn players are.  There are 4 seniors starting on that squad, so this is their year.  If TJ Ford hadn't left for the NBA last year, Texas would have been nearly unbeatable in this tournament.  As it is, though, Texas will survive UNC, but fall to Mississippi State in the Sweet 16, setting up a very good matchup between MSU and Duke.  I haven't said anything about Duke's matchup against the top of the bracket because they shouldn't have much trouble getting to the regional final; only Arizona and Cincinnati could pose a real threat.  Arizona is not the team it has been the last few years, and can really only stop Duke if they get hot early and hold on.  Cincinnati has played a tough schedule all season and that could help them, so if they catch Duke on a bad day, it is possible that they could win, but I don't expect it.  Duke will advance to the regional final, to lose to Mississippi State, who will advance to the Final Four.

<b>West Region</b>
The West Region is probably going to be the easiest to call at the top, with Stanford and Connecticut clearly being the top teams in the bracket, but beneath the top, this one is wide open.  I don't see much separation from seeds 3 through 6, and everyone lower than the 12 seed has at least a chance to win a game.  The best matchup of the tournament between an 8 and 9 seed is here in the West, with Alabama meeting Southern Illinois.  Yes, the Washington-UAB game (Central) and Texas Tech-UNC Charlotte game (North) could both go either way, and should be close matches.  Both teams play crushing defense, both are very athletic, and though the Salukis have a deeper bench and more experience, Alabama has played the toughest schedule in the nation this season and will be ready to face a tough opponent.  This is a lot to say about this one game that, ultimately won't matter too much, because the winner gets to lose in the second round to Stanford.  Stanford is a complete team and will be able to come out of this region unscathed.  Their only test against a team of their caliber will be against Connecticut, a team very dependent upon its stars playing well.  UConn may have the best player in the nation in Emeka Okafor, and has two other star players, but if Stanford can shut down one of them and another is ineffective, even UConn could go down easily.  In any case, I expect a close game that Stanford will ultimately win, sending the Cardinal to the Final Four.  The only serious challengers in this bracket (besides UConn and Stanford) are Maryland and, conditionally, Alabama.  Maryland will have its hand full trying to beat Stanford, but they managed to take down Duke last week, and that has to be helping their confidence level going into the Tournament.  Plus, Maryland was reaching its fullest potential last week, playing its best ball of the season, which Stanford cannot necessarily say.  If Maryland catches Stanford off balance and can hang around to the end of the game, I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way to win it.  Alabama, though, is a much more conditional upset.  They're going to have to absolutely smother Stanford's offense and shoot very well to beat the Cardinal.  Alabama certainly has the players and the toughness to get a win over the #1, but they'll probably fall short on experience and depth.  Likely, Stanford goes on into the Final Four.

<b>Final Four</b>
So, if everything goes along with my projections (and it won't), we'll see Kentucky facing Oklahoma State in the first match of the Final Four, with Mississippi State and Stanford squaring off in the other.  These are the matches I'd like to see, but some variation is likely.  One possibility is that Georgia Tech somehow makes it through Gonzaga and beats Kentucky.  If they do, they could also beat Oklahoma State.  Also, Duke could pull it together and beat Mississippi State.  But for now, I'll take my best stab at the Final Four.  Oklahoma State should be able to handle Kentucky, if they can play good enough defense to slow down Kentucky's potent offense.  If Kentucky comes out shooting the 3 ball, though, OSU could be in trouble.  Good perimeter defense can prevent that, though, and if OSU can match UK up inside with solid perimeter defense, Kentucky can be neutralized and eliminated.  Stanford and Mississippi State is a hard game to call, because you have to figure that if MSU beats Duke, they will be extremely confident about taking down another #1 seed, even if it is the #1 team in the nation.  Stanford, on the other hand, faces a probably less rounded team in UConn before its showdown with the complete Mississippi State squad; rather than focusing on shutting down a few players, Stanford will have to stop the entire MSU offense, and especially limit the points of Lawrence Roberts, the MSU steal from Baylor.  While UConn's trio of stars are very good, and Okafor may be the best individual player in the nation, Roberts won't be very easy to stop, because he's a big body down around the baseline and can move very well.  Stanford will probably have to play its best game of the tournament to survive Mississippi State, to meet up (I am guessing) Oklahoma State for the championship.

<b>National Final</b>
As for the final, I'm picking Stanford for right now, over OSU, but I still have until 12:15pm on Thursday to change my mind.  As I keep looking at the matchups, don't be surprised if I do.  I think Stanford is the best team in the nation right now, so until someone appears to be better, I'm casting my lot with Stanford.  But if I find that one of my other prospective semifinalists matches up well enough against the Cardinal, they might become my national champion.  I'm ready for all of this to start unfolding for real, because March truly is the best month of the year for sports."

"event","It's been a few days since I've written a real entry, but I stayed away from my computer last week as much as I could manage to, since my brother was here on spring break.  Translation: I spent a lot of time playing xbox with him instead of wasting time on the computer like I usually do.  Add to that the fact that my week was even more busy than usual and that's a recipe for having less hours available to spend at a computer.  Not that I'm complianing.  I had fun last week with Phil.  It was kinda like show and tell, really.  It's like, <i>Hello people who know me.  I have a twin brother you didn't know I had.  Isn't that cool?</i>  For instance, at the College Democrats meeting on Wednesday night, they were all fairly intrigued about the whole thing.  They liked him, though, and not just because of his excellent pedigree.  He's a staunch Bush-hater, and that goes a long way in Democratic circles.  I know that reputation has carried me well in the organization, and I like that.  Even if I'm not a solid ""Democrat,"" it feels good to be a part of a party organization, especially when you're feeling upward social mobility in the circle.  It makes me feel good to know that when I decide to bail out on the party, it will be my choice, and that I may actually leave people behind who could be sad to see me leave the party ranks.  Honestly, the idea of being able to bolt the party here in Valdosta to join the Greens would just tickle me, but I'll have to hold onto schemes like that until I help kick America's Illegitmate Son back to Texas.  Speaking of which, I'm working for the Party toward that end; are you helping?

I'll ease off the politics a bit I guess.  I think my journal has taken a decidedly political slant over the past few weeks and months, and while that isn't bad (since it's actually indicative of the direction my life has taken during that time span), I think I should try harder to infuse a more varied range of topics into my journal, just to make it more readable.  I know that the point of the journal is for my own benefit, but I also like to use this as a way of expressing my views to other people.  It's just that my views are falling heavily into the political arena right now, and probably will continue to do so for a while.  I don't think this is an election year syndrome I'm experiencing.  I think it's me discovering that these are the kinds of things I enjoy being involved in.  Not just the political activities, but also the various organizations of governance and government with which I have been working.  One might think that my position in Student Government is political (and indeed it is at other universities; UGA for instance), but at VSU being a senator has been a rather apolitical experience.  There are no factions in the student senate, contrary to what some newspapers would like to report, and that has facilitated my learning and growing experiences over the past two semesters.  I've really enjoyed it, and I think this is the kind of work I could see myself doing on down the line.  Consider that a warning.

So I'm off politics, but still on governance.  Let it be so.  While I'm on this topic, I'll mention that at tonight's senate meeting I got my first document passed for the year.  It's taken me a while to get moving on this, partially because I just didn't know the process, and partially because I hadn't made myself write out a document, but now that it's done, I'd say I enjoyed the process.  If you want to read the resolution, it can be found <b><a href=""http://www.valdosta.edu/~raboyd/docs/sga.resolution.3-15-04.doc"">here</a></b>.  The gist of it is that many VSU faculty have not been following University policy regarding the dissemination of midterm (ie, withdrawal period) grades.  My resolution, on behalf of the SGA, strongly encourages faculty to do their job as mandated in University policy.  I chose to write a resolution rather than a bill because, in my estimation, a change in policy was not required.  The policy already in the books is good.  It's just that it isn't being followed by a lot of the professorate.  Since the SGA does not have the actual power to enforce any kind of significant change (if it does in theory is a <i>very</i> open debate), I thought it would be more effective to pass a resolution strongly encouraging the faculty to amend their sinful ways than it would be to pass a scathing bill that had no teeth.  I hope that my actions will bring this significant problem to the light of day on a university-wide level, and it is my plan to follow through with this until it is taken as far and secured as successfully as is possible, up until the time when I graduate.  I hope that if the work isn't completed by then that someone else will take over the fight, because this is something significant that we, the students, can actually win.  It's important to fight the battles you can win, and this is one of them, a matter where justice in student rights really has to take precedence over what amounts to faculty convenience on the other side of the issue.  If anyone wants to know more about this topic, I can submit previous drafts of my legislation, because the letter I wrote to Dr. Levy provides my rationale more succintly that I've established here.  But, as far as that goes, I've already said a good bit of my thoughts <b><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/shah_andre/40126.html"">here</a></b>* in my journal.

I don't know how much time I'll leave to write for the rest of the week, so I'll go ahead and throw a few more things out before I turn in for the evening.  My calendar has been staying full for the last few weeks, almost as if I have a full time job, and I still need to make time to sleep somewhere along the way.  Here's a few items for my week: <blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Drop off a few resumes at tomorrow's job fair --tomorrow</li>
<li>Help plan the upcoming College Democrats/Republicans Debate --tomorrow night </li>
<li>Try not to be antisocial and screw anything up tomorrow night with my, er, ""language lesson""</li>
<li> Somewhere along the way do some research for my term papers</li>
<li> Come up with something to do for the weekend** </li>
<li> Write an editorial for the <i>Valdosta Daily Times</i></li>
<li> Write a letter to the <i>Spectator</i></li>
<li> Get some rest</li>
</ol></blockquote>

That should about do it for now.  More will come later.

<font size=""-2"">*As a follow up on that previous entry, the status of the two parking ideas I presented back in early February are still in limbo.  I'm waiting on the necessary committees to meet so that I can submit my proposals to the right people.  Faculty and Presidential committees don't meet nearly as often as Student committees do, and I'm actually rather put off be the delays.  Nevertheless, I'll get it all done as soon as I can.

<i>What genius decided to give us a spring break 2 weeks before we finish the semester?  It seems almost pointless.</i>  

I can answer that one.  It was the fine folks down in the Lowndes County Board of Education, ultimately.  Out of consideration for the 1500+ faculty and staff employed at the University, it has traditionally been University policy to take spring break whenever Lowndes County Schools do.  This year, and years past, the public schools have taken their break substantially later than VSU students would prefer, but since it has been convenient for University faculty and staff, it has remained policy to keep the two breaks united.

I find nothing wrong with the idea of helping out the University's faculty and staff by ensuring that the public schools and university breaks coincide, but I think that ignoring the wishes of probably 2/3 of the ~10,000 students at VSU is wrong.  Up until now, students have not had their voices heard on this issue, although that is a changing process.  I know the VSU SGA Senate is working on a bill to do something about the process, and I'm going to make my own recommendations to the process.

There is no reason why VSU and the public schools can't compromise on this issue.  For us to have our spring break begin three weeks after midterm is unfair.  Similarly, for the public schools, they do not reach their midterm until a few weeks after VSU.  So, moving forward the united spring break schedule for the county and university by, for instance, two weeks would go a long way toward alleviating the scheduling discrepancies and inconveniences, really for both sides.  First, VSU students will have their spring break only one week after the midterm.  This is acceptable, in my opinion, because it's early enough to help reduce stress, but far enough from the end of the semester that it is not just a distraction during crunch time.  For public schools, moving the break up by two weeks will move it closer to their midterm, also, with the same benefits the university students will enjoy.  By keeping the break schedules united, there is no inconvenience to VSU faculty and staff who have children in public schools and who would, otherwise, be required to provide for child care in the case of disparate break scheduling.  For these reasons, I support moving the scheduling forward by two weeks.  I will submit this proposal to the senator who is drafting the bill.  I hope it meets with your approval, and as always, your input is encouraged and appreciated."

Many people were there who I hadn't seen in a while (mostly since J&K's wedding), and it was fun catching up on where everyone has been and where they are now.  I think just about everyone brought some form of alcohol to the party, and I didn't see much leaving this morning.  I woke up about noon with a headache, but was otherwise ok.  It was probably 5:30 before I got to bed last night; I was out for a little while, then about 4am Justin and I got into a good conversation, mostly about the woes of the world and why government sucks (that's probably a misrepresentation of what we were actually talking about, but I can't remember at this point).  I guess the lesson learned there would be that if the two of us can outline solid government programs while we're stone drunk, it would seem that a sober government should have no excuse for ineptitude.  <i>Anyway</i>, so the party was lots of fun.  Hopefully J&K will be throwing another one sometime soon....*hint, hint!*

In other news, my bro is coming down to Valdosta sometime early next week, and I'm looking forward to that.  I think everyone is on spring break except VSU, because for whatever reason, the university has opted to schedule its spring break to coincide with the Lowndes county public schools, whose semester is a month longer than ours, making their spring break reasonably timed, but making the university's far too late.  There's no point in shouting at the sky about it, though, so I'll just keep counting the days until break.  I need a trip to the beach (ah...next weekend....Daytona.  Hurrah!!!).  -Fin."

My ladies from the College Democrats decided to not stay and play, which was disappointing, and my Columbian friend Andrea didn't come either.  Also very disappointing.  So we ended up with twelve guys playing poker.  I made it to the final table and finished tied for seventh, going out the same time as my best friend Josh.  I'd had good luck with the cards up until I made it there to the final table, but after that, it was all down the pooper.  Anyway, I'd say that a halved finishing is probably commensurate with my skill level, especially when I have a few drinks in me (it's hard to type now).   After I went out, Britt continued to lose his stack.  Once I realized he was the underdog, I began pulling for him, which probably precipitated his downfall--he lost out the moment I began to root for him.  My apologies, good sir.  You played a fine match.  Anyway, Seth took 1st place after a valiant all-in effort by a severely shorthanded Brandon (2nd place).  Renni took home 3rd.  Congrats, and thanks for coming to play.  I think I'll have to do this again sometime.  Maybe next time more people will come.  I could have easily supported another full table.  At any rate, a fun evening, one I hope I'll repeat sometime soon."

"event","Well that sucks.  I just finished 16th in my tournament.  I was behind the 8 ball the whole time, never had much of a stack to work with.  But it was the first tournament I'd played that was not No Limit.  I have to say, I don't much care for this particular flavor of Texas Hold 'em.  It takes too long to get to good action.  Just my opinion.

Things look good for Friday.  I expect we're going to have a good turnout.  I'm going to aquire some more cards and chips to compensate, but everyone is responsible for their own beer/drink money.  I'd like to be able to just throw that kind of a party, but no tengo dinero.  Oh, and if anyone has access to some folding tables and chairs, let me know, because I may need them.  Later."

"event","Hello everyone.

I'd like to invite all of you to come play in a poker tournament this Friday night at my house, in Valdosta.  The purpose is to have a good time, play some cards, and maybe even win some money/raise some money for an organization.  Here's the plan, as I see it.  There will be a $5 buy in to play in the tournament, and the proceeds will be divided among the winners, and, if everyone is agreeable, a part of the money will go to an organization of the winner(s)' choice.  If you'd rather just keep the cash if you win (or place in the top 5 or so), that's your choice.  Final figures will be determined by the number of people playing, but this is just to entice you to hopefully come play.

If you would like to come, please respond to this post to let me know so I can have an idea of how many people to prepare for.  And if you want to bring some friends, go right ahead.  The more people who play, the more fun the tournament will be for everyone (and the higher the payout to the winner!)

Respond to the post and I'll send the particulars to you in an email.  I'd rather keep my personal info out of the public domain, while advertising this as widely as possible.  Thanks, and I hope to see some of you on Friday."

<blockquote>Phillip says:  i believe that the WTO is full of shit and that true free trade is not good for the world. 

Phillip says:  it WOULD be good for everyone if it didn't exploit cheap labor and make american multinational corps filthy rich, or at least ""competitive in the markets"".

Phillip says:  globalization is supposed to raise the standard of living for everyone, and in time it would. in the meantime it is a painful transition for third world nations. it would be less painful if developed countries did not exploit the workforce in developing countries. also, who has the right to say the Punan, an indigenous tribal culture in Indonesia, even want to have plasma tvs and fast cars?

Phillip says:  globalizations goal is to improve production efficiency by having each nation produce what it is best at producing. most nations become banana republics. the us, due to investment capital and R&D capital for new technologies, will not be a banana republic but able to produce a multitude of things efficiently, even under a fully developed and enacted globalization scheme. Thus, when a brand new

Phillip says:  technology emerges and Bolivia's bananas are rendered obsolete, they are in the crapper. If our bananas are rendered obsolete by emerging technologies, we still will have a comparatively (to the global standard) diverse economy and withstand the change. In light of this, globalization must not be a true lassez-faire orgy, but set up with some guidelines to ensure some form of diversification for

Phillip says:  national economies to prevent localized economic failure that could effect regional (and further escalating to global) conflict. If all of a sudden you don't have anything to trade, no one will send you bananas. when you start to starve you fight. What do we do when Pakistan or Israel are starving and no one will trade? 

Phillip says:  just a thought. gotta get back to star trek.
</blockquote>

Personally, I like how discussing the world's problems, and some solutions, can be fit into a commercial break so that you don't have to miss any <i>Star Trek</i>.  If only solving the world's problems could be done so easily.

"event","I just finished watching <i>Braveheart</i> on tv a little while ago.  It really is such a great movie.  The whole time I was watching it, I wanted to get away and go study (since I'll be doing that for the next five hours or so), but I couldn't force myself to get away from the movie.  I kept waiting for the mention of the final battle, Bannockburn, because that's where the movie really kicks in for me.  It's after William Wallace's martyrdom and execution.  Robert Bruce takes the field, arrayed against the English forces, at Bannockburn, Scotland in 1314.  I enjoy all of <i>Braveheart</i>, but this part is great because I know what that battle meant.  With victory at that battle, the Scots began the 30 year process of gaining independence from England, and winning the Scottish Wars of Independence.  And at that battle, a certain long dead ancestor of mine, one Sir Robert Boyd, leader of the Boyd Clan of Scotland, supported Robert Bruce in winning the fight at Bannockburn.  Thus, I can ostensibly claim some connection to <i>Braveheart</i>.  Did I mention that I like the movie?

I suppose my icon doesn't fit this entry.  Oh well.  I can reconcile my ancestoral background with my current francophilia by saying that the two were longtime allies against the hated English.  So damn all you Angle-landers!"

"event","I played two more poker tournaments today.  I finished the first in 14th, the second in 10th.  I'm disappointed by the second one.  I played stupid and blew a substantial chip pile just before the ante increased to 500 per hand.  Playing short stacked is tough when you don't get the cards.  It was inevitable that I'd drop, it's just too bad that I couldn't hang around a bit longer.  I wanted to make the final table.  Oh well.  I'll try again tomorrow.  Speaking of which, the poker night I had planned on going to tomorrow night has been cancelled, so I guess I'll be at home again.  Either watching Star Trek on Spike TV or playing poker.  Cheers.

EDIT: I've played two more since the previous update.  Finished the 3rd tournament in 9th place, in the money again.  (The top 12 players money).  My brother was online and wanted to play, so I signed onto a 4th tournament.  But I lost interest after he got put out early (in the 80s).  I hung around for a while, divided my attention between poker chat, watching PBS <i>Frontline</i>, and the CNN Presidential debate.  In the process, I lost my chip lead.  Realizing I was getting low on chips, I made a somewhat desperate stab for a pot and lost the rest of my holdings.  Finish, 44th place.  That's my worst ever, in the 100 player tournament.  I'd like to think that if I was playing hard and with undivided attention, I wouldn't have made so many careless errors.  But you can only look at a computer monitor for so long, so it was time to quit anyway.  Speaking of which, I think it's time for bed.

Today's winnings: about $50 in play cash.  But since I didn't get the chance to see a tournament to the finish before starting another, I didn't get to top off, and thus lost most of my net.  But that's ok.  Some of you guys should play with me sometime:  <a href=""http://www.truepoker.com"">www.truepoker.com</a>.  Again, cheers."

"event","Crap.  I spent the last hour playing a poker tournament and I just got put out.  I placed 14th out of 100, just two spots out of the money.  What sucks is that I lost on a full house:  3 kings, 2 6s.  The other player put me all in with my $6000 (he had more chips than I did).  I was in about 5th place on the money list....and he throws down a full house, 3 Aces, 2 Kings.  I hate to lose with a great hand, but that's part of the game.  I guess it's best to lose making the only play you can.  There's no way you can fold with such a great hand, because it's so hard to lose when the cards fall that way.  Oh well.  Not bad for my second tournament.  I'll take a 3rd and 14th.  I don't think I'm bad at this at all.

I guess I'll do the entry I've  been meaning to write, before I forget everything.  Last weekend was my trip to Mobile, Alabama, for the regional college bowl tournament.  I was missing the State Honors Conference in Savannah to go, but I really wanted to compete for the university, so off to Alabama I went.  We were staying at a place owned by the University of South Alabama, the host of the tournament.  Our lodgings were converted army barracks, and it was really in a dumpy neighborhood; at the USA campus, we noticed in the school newspaper that someone had been murdered on a street corner about a mile away from our barracks the previous week.  So I figured we were safe; the probability would be against another incident, right?  Right.

As for the tournament, the VSU team was very good.  We dominated everyone we played, except for the University of Florida and the University of Georgia, who both dominated us.  They were clearly the best two teams in the tournament, as they played in the finals.  UF took home the title, as they usually do.  Anyway, because of the tournament format, we were stuck in the <i>much</i> more difficult division, including UF and UGA, giving us two losses.  The other division was much weaker, and I think we would have beaten every team in that column of the standings, if we had had the opportunity.  As it was, we didn't advance to the playoffs, because of the 2 losses suffered against UGA and UF.  In the consolation tournament, we dominated everyone we played, finishing up 9-2 overall, and officially in 5th place, out of 16 teams.  But we were really the 3rd best team there.  I have no doubt of that.

By the time the tournament was over on midday Saturday, we (the VSU team) were ready to hit the streets of Mobile, because the city was hosting Mardi Gras festivities all day.  We got to downtown, which was a very nice setting (larger than Valdosta's, and quite stately, aristocratic even...like an old bayou/colonial city should be).  People were out in force, awaiting the night's parade.  We ate supper out on a second story balcony overlooking Dauphin Street and the people below, and I enjoyed a good sunset in the process.  By the time the parade started, we were down in the throng of people enjoying everything.  It was a family oriented crowd at this point; when the parade ended, the beads and  beer took hold, and the crowd changed its personality.  For the better, I'd say.  If you've ever been in a public party, I'm sure you know the kinds of things that go on, but it's all good fun.  Currency is exchanged: beads for whatever you'd like to see.  Personally, I just kept the beer flowing and entered into a very relaxed (ie, <i>drunken</i>) state.  In between trips to the port-a-lets, I repeatedly stopped by the Methodist group that was out unsuccessfully trying to proselytize the street-partiers, and engaged in the best theological arguments I could manage at the time.  I'll say I more than held my own against the person with whom I spent a good 20 minutes debating.  I was really just playing with him, playing devil's advocate when I felt like it, playing it straight the rest of the time.  But I'll say, he did well.  Theological discussions are always fun, but they are difficult when you only have half (or less) of your wit with you.  The rest being left in the 16 ouncer in my hand, it probably evened the contest.  But I think I prevailed.  Anyway, he didn't convert me, and I think I helped him feel good about what he was doing, because I'm sure he left with the impression he had planted some sort of seed with me.  Sorry bub.  I'm more of the thorny seed cast along the path.  But thanks for playing anyway.

I had a headache just about all day on Sunday on the drive home, but I was fine later that day.  I don't think anything very eventful happened until Tuesday, when I blew it on turning in my bibliography, but I'm going to get that done this week and weekend.  Probably not too much of a penalty there.  I also found out on Tuesday that I am currently the president of the VSU chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, so I guess I should get something  done in that organization to justify my position.  I think I'll try to find out who the members are and do at least one event, just so that the honor society exists somewhere besides on paper.  I've spent some time this week scrambling around a bit trying to get some other academic honors things taken care of: Dr. Byrd is (hopefully by tomorrow) going to write a letter of recommendation for me so I can turn in my belated nomination for the Honors Program's Bartram Award.  Dr. Riggs (history department head) notified me that I was the winner of the Phi Alpha Theta award (that probably explains my sudden presidency, too), and I found out that I was not going to win some other award that the department had previously nominated me for.  I guess all of these developments are the fruits of my labors the previous three years I've spent on campus, and that should really be serving as motivation for me to stop screwing around for this semester.  I'm quite delinquent in a few classes, and that isn't helping my candidacy for anything at all.  Not to mention that I just don't like to fail at anything.  I'm having trouble getting motivated and active in my class work this semester, but I hope I'll iron that out soon.

I had a College Democrats event tonight.  We were doing a voter registration/pizza night in Patterson Hall.  It went well, except that it seems HSA was having its executive council planning session tonight, which I missed.  Oops.  I'll have to talk to Eric, Shel, and Dr. Adler to find out what I missed, and to get my input in, however belated it may be.  It sucks that I missed it, but I had written it down on my calendar for Tuesday, and I guess the date was changed after I wrote it down.  Oh well.  There probably wasn't any great harm caused by my missing the session.  After the voter drive, I went to Sojourner's with some of my fellow democrats, and we had a good time sipping lattes and telling stories.  I like that group.  There are some interesting people in there, and I wouldn't mind getting to know some of them better.  I suppose I'll get plenty of chances as the semester goes on, because our schedule is rather densely filled with events.  That's what an election year brings.  (which reminds me: on Monday I voted for Kucinich and the 2003 Georgia state flag.  I'm looking forward to Super-Tuesday coming up...that should go a ways toward settling or tightening the democratic presidential nominative race).  I'm going to enjoy working on the various party campaigns and events throughout the spring.  It's all for a good cause, after all.

This just about brings my journal up to date now.  I suppose I'll go to sleep, hating that I've been beaten on a house full of Kings.  Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow."

"event","I don't know why, but all day I thought it was Thursday.  Even as I went to all my Wednesday classes without a second thought, I had the feeling it was Thursday, and acted accordingly.  So I missed my Parking & Transportation appeals committee meeting.  So what, one might say.  I hate skipping out on my obligations, because when I do, that erodes the strength of my arguments when I encourage other people to similarly meet their commitments.  So I screwed it up today.  Life goes on, but that's really irritating me at the moment.  I'm such a scatterbrained person at times, it's a wonder that I don't miss more of these kinds of things.  I'll give a lot of credit to my support staff.  You guys keep me on task probably more frequently than you realize.  Merci.

Probably one reason that I didn't realize I was missing the P&T meeting was that I was playing in a poker tournament at the time.  For whatever reason, it did not register to me that I was not normally at home during that time slot.  But whatever recognition may have occured was probably precluded by me getting highly involved in the poker tournament.  I play <a href=""http://www.truepoker.com"">online</a> with my brother frequently, but I had never played in an actual tournament before.  The setup is thus: 100 players per tournament, separated into about 10 different tables.  I was hoping I'd get placed at Phil's table, because I like to talk smack during the match.  It keeps things fun.  Mostly, I speak in French, just to be different.  I get different reactions doing that...some people are amused, others are <i>very</i> hostile, which I adore.  Anyway...back to the main thrust of the tournament, I hadn't played one before, so I assumed I'd be put out very quickly, because I'm not a very good poker player (not this variety, No Limit Texas Hold 'em, anyway).  But out of the 100 players in the field, 2 hours later I found myself in the final 3.  I didn't win, but 3rd was a very nice finish.  I guess it was an extra benefit for me to know that I beat Phil (finished in the 20s), and that he's never finished as high as I did, and on my first time out, to boot.  We aren't usually competitive, but I guess games bring it out in us.  Video games, poker, you name it.  I guess twins have to compete at some things, or we wouldn't be normal.

Playing so long in the poker tournament put me a bit behind schedule for going to my grandparents' house.  Since they can afford calling England more than I can, I drove to Nashville to make the call.  I hadn't spoken with my sister in a few weeks and was really wanting to, thus the trip.  Not to mention my grandpa had made a really good supper.  I couldn't turn it down.  I'm glad to note that she (my sister) seems to be doing ok in England now, not that she isn't still quite gloomy about being there.  She didn't really like that James was deployed to Angle-land, but that's part of the gig, I suppose.  She's all settled into her new home and is trying to adjust to life in a new country.  We talked about my pending trip to England, tentatively scheduled for June 4-...whenever.  I looked into the travel protocols while I was at work today, and found a program by which I could obtain a ""blue card"" (Britian's equivalent to a US work permit for prospective foreign workers).  That's good news for me, because I think I'll be able to procure a blue card without too much trouble.  Finding a job near where they live may be difficult, but that's something to worry about more when I get closer to the time to go.  I'm becoming quite certain that moving to England is the tack I want to take when I graduate in May, and that definitely gives me something to look forward to.  I've been wanting to go abroad again for about two years, and I think the timing and circumstances are very right at this time.  It could all work out, so here's hoping.  Phil is working on arranging a semester exchange for Fall 2004, so that would be great (and odd) if all three of us (he, my sister, and I) were able to live in England at the same time.  I don't think any of us would have predicted that scenario, but if it works out, I think it will be a very enjoyable experience for us all.  For those of you who may have remembered previous discussions of (perhaps) going to Yellowstone this summer with me, I think you'll probably need to find another tour guide.  I'm fairly certain that I'll be withdrawing my candidacy on that ballot.  I can always advise, though, if anyone stilll wants to go.

That about wraps things up for now.  I've gotten myself into the very bad habit of staying up later and later into the night, so I'll still be up a while longer before turning in for the evening.  I'm hoping to finish up my part of the work for <lj user=""ericclausen""> and <lj user=""shelchan"">, so that by the time they get to Savannah for the conference this weekend, they won't advertising bad information by promoting a webpage that doesn't yet exist."

"event","Here's an update on me, since I haven't written a real post in a good long while.  I'm still disenchanted with life in Valdosta.  But the remedy to that is coming up soon, when I graduate and head out on the road for life.  The one impediment to this process, finishing up senior seminar, isn't going so well at the moment, because I just <i>can't</i> make myself work on my term paper.  I loathe doing research on it.  But I enjoy my political science classes.  Incidentally, I got my first test back today.  I didn't feel too good about it, and assumed the worst.  I got an 84 on it, which turns out to be an A+ in Dr. Peterson's way of grading.  He's a super tough grader, but he cuts a lot of slack in the grading scale to balance it out.  I can't complain.  I actually prefer that method.  It doesn't leave you feeling smug, like you think you know everything there is to know about the subject.  But it leaves room on the scale to show that you've subsumed a good bit of the material and understand it.  So you've learned, and you find out what you haven't learned yet, so you can go learn it after the test.  It makes sense to me.

Outside of school, I've about mailed it in with the tutoring job in Homerville.  They jerked me around too long, and unless they can make serious amends, they'll have to depend on someone else to make the drive and go tutor the kids.  I feel badly for the students there, because they really need the help, and it's a shame they're not getting the help they deserve.  But I have my limits and I can't afford to let the school board waste my time like they've been doing.  I don't work <i>pro bono</i>, at least not in this stage of my career.  I'm not wealthy enough to be a philanthropist just yet.  I suppose they don't understand that.  But they'll be finding out in the next few days, I can guarantee that.

Final note, I've been kicking around the idea of having poker night sometime soon.  I don't know who among you would be interested, or who likes to play (I like Texas Hold 'em, the variety of poker usually played on TV), but I think it would be a fun time.  Just a thought though.  Any takers?"

"event","This isn't an actual journal entry.  It's my notes from the study session I've been doing the last several hours.  No need to read this, unless you're interested in some current affairs stuff, or historical political analyses of US foreign policy.  Moving right along....

<lj-cut text=""Here's the fun stuff"">

-1. Bush on ""Meet the Press"": Tim Russert tried to pin Bush with some difficult questions, most of which he was able to avoid without too much trouble, when necessary.  Bush shifted the rationale for the Iraq war (again), pointing to the ""possibility"" that Hussein could ""someday"" acquire WMDs, a far cry from Cheney's claim that Iraq posed an ""imminent"" danger to the US.  Also, Russert tried to nail Bush on his military service question (AWOL in the 70s), which Bush dodged easily.  In general, Bush used rhetoric effectively enough to avoid discussing anything he didn't want to discuss, or used red herrings liberally to drag the conversations off Russert's intended tracks.

0.  George Tenet at Georgetown University: In spite of the apparent nature of the CIA's intelligence debacle contributing to the Iraq war, director Tenet steadfastly refuses to admit any fallacious intelligence, even when confronted with evidence by others showing the  CIA's failure.

1. David Kay Testimony:  Kay, former chief weapon inspector in post-war Iraq, finally gave up the search for WMDs, saying that the evidence does not support claims to the weapons' existence.  Kay blamed the US intelligence community for having faulty information, not supporting Bush's claims to justify the war.

2. Kay's report has led Bush to form a faux 'review commission' to decide whether or not the intelligence received by the White House was indeed faulty.  The commission won't unveil its findings until AFTER the 2004 presidential elections, though, pointing to the politically tenuous position Bush has left himself in the wake of unsubstantiated claims to the danger of Iraq.

3. Mostly, the overall feeling of the primaries season among democrats has been that there is a unified desire to remove Bush from office.  The differences between the democratic candidates have not largely and significantly been explored by most voters.  Among significant (and unresolved) issues of foreign policy are Trade agreements, and how the candidates view NAFTA, etc.; but by and large, differences in F.P. do not seem to have been driving factors in the primary season.  Candidates' support (or lack thereof) of the Iraqi War is probably the most obvious expression of F.P. in the campaign at the moment, but even that has not shown much effect in how the Primaries season is unfolding.

4.  Summit of the Americas, conferences with: Mexico: to discuss Bush's proposed legislation involving immigration reform.  includes illegals receiving amnesty to stay in the US and continue working.
Canada: to offer Paul Martin a carrot: work contracts in Iraq for Canadian firms.  An effort to quiet criticism of the Bush Admin's Iraq policy.

5.  2 Key points about Bush's SotU F.P. goals:  Continuing to fight globably terrorism and nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Fighting against Al Qaeda wherever necessary is to support American security, and even though the US hasn't been attacked since 9.11.01, America must remain vigilant, etc.  That means the US will deploy troops where necessary, to guarantee safety for the US.  Or something like that.  Nation-building: The US will support building democratic (pro-US) regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, post-invasion, so that the two might become pillars of democracy in the Middle East.  This is to increase regional security and stability, protecting (hopefully) against fundamentalist/unfriendly governments in the region.

6.  Russia is concerned about the eastward movement of NATO troops toward Russia.  The US wants to move bases to new, Eastern NATO members to be closer to hot-spots in the Balkans and Middle East, but Russia is anxious about having NATO troops closer to its territory.  Russia wants some kind of oversight over bases in former Soviet Republics entering into NATO, but those republics are not interested in Russian involvement.

7.  The US currently plans to hand over government to the Iraqis by July 1, giving Iraq sovereignty.  At that point, US policy will be partly determined by what the new Iraqi government allows, even if that government will not yet be fully independent.  Iraq is about 2 years behind Afghanistan in its political evolution, following US invasion, occupation, and nation-building.  Essentially, then, by July 1, the Bush Administration hopes to have Iraq in an position to begin allowing very graudaul de-escalation of US involvement, while still maintaining the security and integrity of the nation as it continues its democratization.  Same with Afghanistan.

8.  2 examples of Impact of global/historical factors on US F.P.: 1. Beginning of Cold War: changed how the US interacted with the rest of the world through its F.P.  The USSR became a major rival and counterbalance to US goals and motives globally, shaped global economic, military, and political policies.  Led to a partition of the globe into 2 disparate camps, greatly increased tensions, and military combat (Korea, Vietname, etc), based on US policies of containment (ie, via Truman Doctrine). 
2. End of Cold War: began the process toward a unipolar world, with the US surviving as hegemon.  Allowed the US to continue its position at the fore of global affairs, as well as enabling long-repressed changes to unfold in Eastern Bloc Europe.  In the post-Cold War era, military, economic, and political policies have needed revision and redirection, as the US adjusts to its position as sole claimant to global hegemony.

9. 2 examples of Impact of domestic/societal facors on US F.P.: 1. Beginning of Cold War: advent of Cold War led to fear in the US public, providing a veritable mandate to government to take up a defensive posture vis-a-vis the USSR.  Development of containment/deterrance policies, with public consent.  
2. Vietnam: changed public perception, from national security fears to demand to withdraw from a divisive, damaging conflict.

10. Description of 2 most important gov't oranizations, playing a role in F.P.: DOD, DOS.  Department of Defense provides the leverage necessary to enforce the policies developed by the Department of State.  The two can work together, independently, or against each other.  DOD provides the muscle to guarantee that the US position will be respected. This can allow the DOD to strongarm policy.  Similarly, the DOS can leverage its policies either by using the DOD as enforcer, or by manipulating treaties/agreements (ie, trade and politics).

11. Three theories of US Diplomatic History:
	A. Orthodox (Thomas Bailey): The US was isolationist from 1797 to 1898, focused on internal development and stabilizing the nation. Became a powerhouse as a result of inward focus.  1898-1941, US moved toward internationalism, through T.Roosevelt, economic imperialism, but was still largely isolationst.  1941-present, US became a global power in the course of WWII and continued to dominate afterwards.

	B. Revisionist (William Appleman Williams): A product of the Vietnam era, US history was revised as a systematic	process of conquest and expansion, not defensive and isolationist.  Manifest Destiny filled in the plains, then the US looked abroad for new territories: imperialism in 1898 and the Open Door.

	C. Post Revisionism (Jerod Rosati): US had never been isolationist, was always interventionist.  3 phases of historical periodization: 1776-1860s=Continental Era of interventionism (in N. America); 1860s-1940s=Regional Era of interventionsim (Latin America and Asia); 1940s-present=Global Era of interventionism, with the Cold War policies.

12. Two causes of the Cold War (WWII period and Post-War period): 1941-1945: Mistrust and Misconceptions during the war, and immediately after it contributed to a volatile climate. Misinterpretations of the actions of the other state contributed to volatility.  Aggressive acts (Berlin Blockade, USSR atomic weapon development, etc) increased tension.  During the war, Yalta showed how the Allies had drifted apart, once victory was within reach, because as threat subsided, so did the necessity of cooperation.  Ideological differences and national interests took over and led to a rift between the US and USSR.

13. Two reasons for the transition from intense Cold War to Detente/Thaw: Cuban Misslie Crisis led to less aggressive postures by both the US and USSR, because of the real threat of 'mutually assured destruction.'  Down the line, this led to missle talks, limited test-ban, etc.  Also, withdrawl from Vietnam and the Truman Doctrine (US would not necessarily try to contain communism everywhere) eased relations between the US/USSR.

14. Two reasons for the transition from Detente/Thaw to Neo-Cold War: Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Reagan's ascendancy. Soviets feared fundamentalist Islamic government, US supported freedom fighters.  Reagan revived old school war rhetoric, met equally and reciprocated by the old Soviet leadership; renewed arms race.

15. Three developments from 1985-1991 (end of Cold War) with the most direct impact on US F.P.: Gorbechev's ascendancy led to rapid reforms in the USSR, including democratization in outer Eastern Europe.  This spread back to the USSR, which dissolved.  

16. First five articles generally view US F.P. in a negative light, probably well earned.  Whether disdaining US unilateralism, imperialism, interventionism, overextension, etc., the articles in general cast US F.P. as the tool of a nation in decline, except for Nye's acticle (New Rome meets New Barbarians).

17. The last three articles differ in their depictions of US policies.  General Clark's assertions of the central role played by NATO in resolving the Kosovo conflict came across as critical of Bush's current handling of Iraq and Afghanistan, which were unilateral.  The Afghani article took a regional scope of the current status and progress of Afghanistan's reconstruction and its direction in the future.  The Camp David article explained the insider view of planning the Iraq war, how decisions were made and the processes involved.  There, US policy was the result of quick reactions against the terrorist attacks of the previous week.

"event","I'm in the process of drafting some bills to present soon to the SGA Senate and I'd like some input from whoever is interested in helping me out.  I have the basic ideas, but I haven't begun working on the wording for the drafts yet.  As of now, here are the basics of three of the four bills:
<blockquote>
1.  Academics - <b>Purpose</b>: <i>To have midterm grades available to students prior to midterm deadline for course withdrawl</i>.  This seems to be an obvious thing, but it is not currently guaranteed for upper division (3000-4000 level) classes.  Lower division classes enjoy the benefit of this rule, and I feel that it safeguards students who may be otherwise be subject to a nasty after-midterm surprise if their initial receipt of grades are lower than expected.  If this happnes in a course after the midterm deadline for withdrawl has passed, the student would be in a serious predicament that could have been easily prevented by the professor alerting the student of his/her grade before the deadline.  This is a common sense issue, and I have yet to find a reason why this protection should not be extended to upper division students.  I will be posing this question to faculty in the weeks ahead, but I see no reason why there should be a problem with enacting this bill from a functional standpoint.  I expect resistance from faculty who prefer complete freedom in the classroom, but I think the exchange of a little freedom for a lot of protection for the student is an acceptable and justifiable trade.

I want this bill to be enacted by Fall Semester, 2004.

2.  Parking  - <b>Purpose</b>: <i>To revise current rules regarding parking in Staff/Reserved spaces in certain parking lots</i>, to allow earlier student parking access to lots that are not needed after standard office hours.  The current rules stipulate that students may not park in Faculty/Staff spaces before 9:30pm. By that time, though, most lots off Main Campus are either mostly empty, or (at most) only partially used by Faculty and Staff.  Revising the rules to an earlier time, such as 7:00pm, would allow students easier access to parking around campus at night while not interfering with the parking needs of Faculty and Staff.  By excluding core parking lots on Main Campus (such as Nevins lot, UC lot, West Hall lot, etc), as well as at Pound Hall and Continuing Education, Faculty and Staff will still be able to find parking, even if students use up freed spaces on the periphery of campus (such as Jeanette lot, Oak Street Faculty/Staff spaces, Sustella, Martin Hall, North Campus Softball field, etc.).  The idea is that Faculty and Staff usually do not need these spaces after regular office hours.  For example, at the Honors House (where I was ticketed last night), there is no reason to withold those few spaces until 9:30 out of any need Faculty/Staff might have, since they have no use.  Since HSA holds events there at night, though, we should be able to use that lot when it is not otherwise needed.  The same holds true all over campus; Jeanette lot could  be of great use to residents of Georgia, Langdale, and Reade Halls, etc. at night when Faculty and Staff do not need the spaces.

As a means of compensation for the possibility of taking away spaces that Faculty and Staff may actually need in these hours, I am prepared to offer a further revision of current Parking and Transportation rules to provide for the creation of 24 Hour Reserved spaces for Faculty/Staff in locations where a certain number can be deemed necessary, protected by an increased fine (up to $30 per violation) to deter student misuse.  This may be necessary in order to ensure that my proposal does not appear to be unilateral and without concern for the Faculty and Staff perspective of the issue.  Furthermore, I would encourage the SGA to provide part of the funds necessary to enact these changes, so that they could be completed as soon as possible.  I feel that this proposal would be embraced by VSU students, and would be fair to the needs of Faculty and Staff.

It is my hope that the bill can be ratified and enacted by April 9, 2004, as Spring Break concludes.

3. Parking  - <b>Purpose</b>: <i> To encourage students, faculty, and staff to park legally</i> by providing an option to purchase up to 50% of the cost of a VSU parking permit with money from one's parking fines.  This proposal would likely effect an increase in parking permit purchases, since the overall cost would be (relatively) decreased.  For example, supposing that a student has three outstanding parking violations, with late fees, that would amount to a fine of $45.  A VSU parking permit costs $50.  Under this proposal, the student would be allowed to put $25 of his/her $45 fine toward purchasing a parking permit, so that in the future he or she might not have to pay another fine for unauthorized parking.  This proposal should allow P&T to maintain a sufficient amount of income to warrant interest in the plan, as well as encouraging members of the VSU community to park where they are supposed to.  This would relieve parking pressures on everyone, even if it does not solve the shortage problem.

Since Faculty and Staff are required to purchase permits (I think), I'd be willing to consider some way of making this process applicable to them, to ensure fairness for all parties.  This could include some fine reductions up to a certain limit, but I'd have to negotiate on that, and it's a detail that can be worked out later.

I would like to have this proposal enacted by the same time as the other parking proposal, by April 9, 2004.</blockquote>

If anyone has anything to suggest about these proposed Senate bills, please give me whatever ideas you have.  I think that all three of these are to the benefit of the students of VSU, and should be supported to the utmost to pass through the Senate, and, hopefully, through the Student Life committee that stands over the Senate."

"event","<a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/2/171117/8823"">This</a> is an entertaining article about why MT blogs should die.  I'd say that it isn't without some merit, (if I take the troll bait) except that I do some of the same asinine things here on LJ with my journal, just like everyone else.  Not that I care.  I write when I feel like it, and that's good enough for me.  I'm not too worried about how others receive my opinions.  If mine aren't compatible with yours, read someone else's journal, or write for yourself.  At least enjoy it when you come across a lunatic/""auteur"" journal, because those are the kings of comedy.  Enough for now.  I'm tired.

"event","I submitted my State of the Union livejournal post to <i>The Spectator</i> this week and they've posted it as a ""Web Exclusive.""  I hope to receive some feedback on it, especially from the Republican contingency on campus.  That would be particularly good, because I'm itching for some more argumentation.  I haven't seen the actual newspaper for the week, but I'm going to guess that if they're calling it a Web Exclusive, it probably isn't in print.  Oh well.  I can't complain, though.  I'll thank <lj user=""psynophile""> for suggesting that I submit it to the paper, since the thought really hadn't occured to me at all.  I was mad about Bush's speech and wrote this as a personal response, and as my own position paper.  Having a wider readership is just a bonus.

Anyway, that does it for now.  I have to be at the UC in an hour to take part in the College Bowl.  Pull for the SGA team because I want to win a DVD player."

I guess this isn't a bad start.  I'm obviously up for a trip to New England, and I'd like to see the Pacific northwest, too.  I might as well see that stuff in the middle, too, but all in good time.  I'm more interested in the corner sections first.  Maybe after another trip to Europe.  Who knows."

"event","In a conversation with <lj user=""psynophile"">, we were discussing various space type things.  In the process, we came up with some good energy policy for Earth:

andreshah: ...but if planets are still molten on the inside, does that mean they're still cooling off?
psynophile: no
andreshah: what keeps them hot?  kinetic energy ripping through space?
psynophile: the molten lava, is also caused by the differeing and wavering electromagnetic fields around the earth
psynophile: *the planet
andreshah: oh
psynophile: compression/friction keeps things nice and bubbly too
psynophile: anyway anyway
psynophile: see jupiter's about ready to pop
andreshah: so in theory we should have a ready source of heat/energy if we could figure out how to use it
psynophile: the earth is huge, man
psynophile: yes, in theory
psynophile: but then why don't we just use nuclear fusion?
psynophile: anyway..jupiter needs a bit more mass to hit that criticle point
psynophile: to explode it into a heat/light nuclear fusion/fission machine otherwise known as a star
andreshah: that seems to be a good idea to me. all we'd have to do is ensure that the safeguards are satisfactory, and pay attention to the reactors.  i'm a proponent of nuclear energy, so i think we should use it to power whatever we c an.
psynophile: right on
psynophile: because we're really running out of other energies really fast
andreshah: we can shoot political exiles into jupiter until it reaches critical mass.  then we can use the resultant ""star"" fusion to power ahnold swarzeneggar's hummer.
andreshah: yeah, we're eating up our coal deposits like skittles
psynophile: hahahahahh...shoot gwb into jupiter
andreshah: *splash*
psynophile: a few months later a black lump of coal will land in texas with a note attached...'we don't want this motherfucker, you keep him'
andreshah: hahaha
andreshah: this should be cheney's energy policy.  

Thank you for your patience.  This has been brought to you by the <i>Shoot Dubya into Jupiter Foundation</i>"

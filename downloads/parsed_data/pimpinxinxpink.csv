saturday-i tried to go outside and play in the snow but it was to windy so that made it to cold.instead garrett,ashley,evan,brett,jake,sarah and me went to the movies and saw are we there yet? it was HILLARUIOS! 1 part tho was really sad. im not tellin tho. the whole movies is just funny. every1 should c it.

sunday- i went outside. me jake and garrett built a ig-loo(sp?). its pretty cool. its a lil on the small side but it will do. later wen ashley came out we burried garrett. it was sooo funny. we burried him packed all the snow down really good..and i bet u guessed it we left him. we ended up comin back and diging him out because he couldnt move. after that every1 went in and stayed in cause it go to cold to go outside.

"event","Alanna didn't find herself riding alone much anymore. It was a feeling she missed and was taking full advantage of, even if it was only a few hours of solitary riding after she had parted from the company she was with. Moonlight seemed to be enjoying the ride as much as she was. 

Alanna was in a good mood as rode up to Pirate's Swoop. The familiar sight actually added to her good mood. Of course, that was when a cold breeze reminded her of why exactly she had been contemplating turning around and riding in the other direction.

""He couldn't end up in the desert now, could he?"" She asked Moonlight.

If the horse had an opinion, she held it to herself.

Alanna gave one last look behind her, and set off towards Pirate's Swoop.

"event","Alanna's set of rooms in the palace was fairly modest in both size and furnishings, but it did however have a separate, private room for a bath and that was the important part for Alanna.  The one downside of spending the winter in the desert was that you then got sand everywhere and it never really washed out.  But now Alanna felt she had perfection - a warm bath after a long workout, something pleasant smelling, a loud pounding on the door.  

Alanna suddenly sat up in the tub and cursed.  The knocking didn't stop.

<lj-cut text=""At least it came with food"">
""Who's there?"" She yelled across the rooms.  

""Her Majesty, Queen Thayet wishes to break-fast with Sir Alanna of Olau."" A pompous voice informed her, somewhat muffled by door and space.

Alanna cussed out and very quickly got herself out of the tub and into clothes before opening the door.  Thayet stood on her doorstep, a small bundle in her arms, Buri glowering behind her.  Before Alanna had a chance to say anything, the queen walked into Alanna's non-sleeping room (mostly used for temporary luggage storage) and sat down near a small table as servants set out food for two on the table. Within moments, the food had been placed and the servants gone, leaving Thayet and Buri sitting at a table, the bundle in Thayet's arms gurgling and Alanna dripping on her floor.

""Good morning?"" Alanna finally managed, wincing as some water made her clothes stick to her in very uncomfortable ways.  

""Good morning."" Thayet confirmed, smiling.  ""Breakfast?""

Buri smirked and began loading food on to her plate.

Alanna gave up and fell into a chair. ""Sure.  To what do I owe this visit?""

""I'm not allowed to drop by and feed my friend?"" Thayet asked innocently.

""And mock."" Buri cheerfully added.

Alanna gave them a sour look and began to dump food on her plate. ""I was taking a bath.""

""You were in there for over half an hour."" Thayet cheerfully informed her and gave Roald a tickle before putting him in the small crib that apparently someone had left in Alanna's room just for that purpose.  

""I had sand!"" Alanna argued.

""You've been here for over a week."" Buri informed her.

""Sand doesn't care."" Alanna told her sulkily.

""We are not arguing about sand."" Thayet informed her before the conversation spiraled any more out of control. ""How long are you with us?""

Alanna bought herself a moment to respond while she ate. ""I promised my father I'd stay with him for a few days and explain why I keep snickering every time I see George."" She ignored Thayet's questioning look and Buri's twisted expression. ""And Jon asked me to look into a few things out in the middle of nowhere where they don't have proper baths."" Thayet let out a very un-queen like snort and picked up Roald who had started sniffling in his crib. Buri had given up eating for a minute so that she wouldn't choke. ""So, I'll probably stay here for a few more days, a few days at Sir Myles's house, and the ride out.""

""Almost three weeks total then."" Thayet said casually.  ""Anywhere specific you're heading eventually?  Possibly somewhere coastal.  And new."" She said this very casual and very focused on rocking Roald.  Her small smile did give her away.  Buri had still not started eating again.

Alanna growled at them over her food. ""That is a possibility."" She told her breakfast.

""Uh huh."" Thayet said and suddenly got an odd expression on her face.  ""Hold him please."" She said and put Roald in Alanna's arms before Alanna had a chance to respond.  Thayet very quickly made her way into Alanna's tiny bath chamber.  Alanna blinked at Thayet then blinked back down at Roald. Roald gurgled up at her.

""Your mother is the reason I am going to go gray young."" Alanna informed him.  Roald gurgled again. Alanna ignored the tiny voice about a blonde girl from the future and glanced over at Buri. Buri gave her a bland look in return.

Thayet returned to the main room, slightly pale. 

""Are you all right?"" Alanna asked, slightly concerned.  She reached over to hand Roald back to his mother.

""Diner disagree with you again?"" Buri asked blandly.

Thayet gave the young woman a sharp look before putting Roald back into his crib.  ""Yes, I'm fine. Buri, I have no idea what you're talking about."" 

Alanna glanced back and forth between the two and finally gave up.

""So what have you two been up to?"" She tried, casually. 

Thayet looked very happy with the topic change.
</lj-cut>

Half an hour later, Thayet, Buri, Roald, and dirty dishes were gone and Alanna was left alone in her rooms, still slightly damp.  ""I swear, the world used to make sense.""

She sat at her desk, grabbed some parchment and began writing letters to people she was supposed to have written to months ago.

"event","Alanna was competing in the tournament next week and was not in the mood for prowling the streets of a country she barely knew.  She was in the mood to clean her sword and read up on Tyra history.  Which is why she was alone when she suddenly burst into song.

<Lj-cut text=""Let's get down to business..."">
<i>Let's get down to business - to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I've ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you</i>

At this point, Alanna had the urge to stand up and start dancing her way through sword drills.  While still singing.

<i>
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

Alanna jumped up on to the bed, still threatening invisible enemies with her sword.

<i>
I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say goodbye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim
</I>

She jumped off of the bed, still continuing her song.

<i>
Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

Alanna quietly put down her sword.  ""What was that?"" There was a long pause as she processed the song.  ""And what's a Hun?"""

Dear friends who would never make me help you with wedding preparations unless they involved killing people,

The good news is, I am no longer covered in mud, quicksand, or questionable dinner.  Please don't ask about that one.  

The bad news is, I am now somehow helping with wedding preparations.  His Royal Pain in the Rear is getting married to the ever lovely Princess Thayet in a moon's time.  You would think as King's Champion I would be doing something useful, like security.  Well, I am.  And you really, really don't want to hear all the gossip I've managed to learn.  But somehow, Thayet also wants me to be her in wedding party and my hysterical screams of ""NO!"" are not being heard.  And since I am constantly surrounded by ladies, I am not allowed to punch people who annoy me.

I am patiently, <i>patiently</i>, awaiting the end of this torment so I can go back and chase down law breakers, bandits, and other people who annoy me.  Like Raoul, who won't stop laughing and wouldn't help me when I was stuck in quicksand.  Or in a very bad dinner conversation.  That man is pure evil.

It's cold and I miss the desert.

How have you been?  What is the latest insanity Fandom decided to deal you?  I should be able to recieve letters for the next month or so, so please, please, please entertain me in a way that does not involve drinking, dancing, violence, and me plotting vengeance against very seamstress in the city.

Sincerely yours,

Sir Alanna of Olau.

""OW."" She informed it with a glare and picked herself up.  A quick glance around showed her that she was on a vaguely familiar street, but she didn't see anyone she recognized.  With a shrug, she headed off in a direction she thought was correct.

It wasn't until she walked by the restaurant did the pieces fall into places.  With a wry grin, she stepped inside and sat down.  As she sat there waiting for the waitress to take her order, she remembered the last time she had been there.  The last time she had sat there.  And the last time her cat made snarky comments from inside her bag.  And for the first time, the memory didn't make her cry.  Instead, she felt something inside her unwind and a weight inside of her felt much lighter.

""We prefer to call it planetary storage unit that sometimes moves,"" John said, not really thinking of the new arrival.  It happened all the time.  ""It's more PC this way.  Keeps the feelings from being hurt and all.""

""Ah, okay.  Hey John.""  Alanna sheathed her sword.  ""I thought you were in Ma...some state that starts with M?""  

""Was I?""  John frowned and tapped the side of his head with a finger.  ""Aeryn, we been to a state that starts with an M lately.""
 
Aeryn, hand tightly on the holster of her gun, shook her head.  ""No.  We've been here.  Nothing has moved.""

Alanna blinked.  ""It might have started with another letter?""  She blinked some more.  ""And I just talked to you last week.""  More blinking.  ""Maybe it was a T?""  And some more blinking. 

The hand Aeryn had on her pulse pistol tightened.  ""You're mistaken.  We've been here and you're obviously suffering from some sort of head wound if you saw us.""
 
John, for his part, laughed.  ""Don't worry, I've been suffering from a head wound for years.  You're in a good company.  Aeryn's just jealous.""

Alanna continued blinking.  ""Aeryn.""  She pointed.  ""John.""  She pointed again.  ""And you have no clue who I am.""  Her brain was finally beginning to catch up and she summarized things with a few explicatives.

John shrugged and waved it off.  ""Nope, never seen you before.  Doesn't mean you're not welcome here.  Just ignore the little green slug.  He'll try and take your money.  Right, Aeryn?""
 
Aeryn was staring at the new girl coldly, making sure she made no sudden moves.  ""Right.""
 
John grinned and spread his arms.  ""See.  Now we know you.  Welcome to Moya.""

Alanna was giving Aeryn the same sort of look, possibly because she actually did know what Aeryn could do with the blaster.  ""Right.  I'm Alanna.""  She tried to remember if she had pointed this out and gave up.  ""Why does this keep happening to me?""

A boy clad entirely in green swooped into view, giving the girl a strange look. ""Sayyyy, who are you supposed to be?"" he asked, alighting onto a nearby tree stump.

""Alanna.""  Alanna replied, blinking more at his outfit then at the fact that he had swooped in.  ""Where am I this time?""

""Now that's a silly question!"" He threw his head back and crowed. ""You're in Neverland. Second star to the right, and straight on 'till morning!""

""...Great.""  Alanna commented and put her sword back on her hip where it belonged.  ""So um, what is this place?""  She asked, glancing around.  

""What <i>is</i> it?"" He folded his arms, huffing at her question. ""It's only the best place in the whole world, that's what. <i>I'm</i> never gonna grow up. I'd rather be here.""

""Ignoring the physical issues with that statement...wait, weren't you flying earlier?"" Sometimes, Alanna's brain took a minute or two.

""What, flying?"" Peter pushed off, hovering in mid-air for a few seconds before swooping down and circling again. ""You mean to tell me you can't fly?""

""No.""  Alanna said flatly, trying to figure out where she lost her sanity.  Possibly when she left the Bahzir desert.  Possibly when she told her twin that changing places would be a good idea.

He was now winding around her, smirking. ""You sure? I bet you've never even tried,"" he teased.

Alanna frowned.  ""I tried.  I got a headache for a week.""  She tracked him with her eyes.  ""How come I never go anywhere normal?""

""Must be 'cause you're a grown-up,"" he said, looping back again. ""Grown-ups aren't supposed to be here. How'd you get here, anyway?""

""I fell from the sky.""  Alanna commented dryly.  And literally.

""Should've flapped your wings,"" he said, bending his elbows and demonstrating. ""C'mon, it's fun, I'll show you! Get somewhere high! Follow me!""

Alanna grabbed her bag just in case.  ""I don't have wings.""  She pointed out, but followed the strange boy.  It's not like her life could get weirder...or more dangerous.

""Course not,"" he scoffed. ""That doesn't mean you can't fly.""  He soared up to an overhanging cliff over the sea. ""You've gotta think happy thoughts,"" he explained.

Alanna gave him a very dirty look.  ""You live my life and think happy thoughts.""  She snorted.  ""Happy thoughts.""

""What, did Dairine come-"" But as he turned around, seeing the young woman with the sword laying on ground, Kit, who'd been distracted enough not to notice her yell, stopped himself.  ""Hello...?"" he ventured.


Alanna scrambled to her feet, still blinking, though more at the visible Earth, than the two teens also on the moon.  ""Um, hi.  That's the Earth.""  She pointed out, a little numbly.  ""And we're breathing.  While not on Earth.""

""There's a bubble keeping our air in,"" Nita said, pointing to the larger circle of shimmering, spidery characters several feet away; it marked the border outside where the waste gases glinted in the Earth light as they condensed rapidly to frozen mist. ""Kit, how much extra did we put in? Enough for a third person?""

Alanna blinked.  ""Hopefully?  I'd rather not suffocate, thanks.""  She blinked again.  ""Magic or science?""

Kit shook his head. ""Wizardry,"" he explained. ""And yeah, we've got enough, at least for a bit."" He looked down at the spell diagram. ""We've got as much done on here as we're going to, anyway; I think we're at a dead end.""
 
Looking at the diagram herself, Nita nodded. ""Yeah,"" she agreed. ""Later, though. So,"" she continued, turning to their unexpected guest. ""I take it you weren't headed for the moon, then. Where were you hoping to land?""

""Virginia.""  Alanna said dryly.  ""But I've pretty much given up on that.""   

""We could probably get you down there..."" Nita said. ""But we'd need more exact coordinates. What can you tell us about it?""

At about that moment, a bright purple portal opened behind Alanna.  ""That would be my ride, actually.  Um, nice meeting you.  Good luck with your thing.""  She stepped through, and the portal closed behind her.

Nita and Kit blinked at each other. ""... That wasn't a worldgate,"" Kit said."

"event","After leaving the Hyperion in the morning, Alanna had fully planned to go Fandom.  Really.  No detours.  Which didn't explain how she ended up dropping out of the sky on to a ""Welcome to Sunnydale"" sign and then tumbling down a dusty crater.

Sometime later, she had become the red-head previously known as a red-head due to the layer of dust coating her from head to toe.  

""Not funny."" She growled at the universe and grabbed her things, which had remained at the lip of the crater.  Of course.  A few minutes later, she stepped through another portal.

After two hours of scrambling in the dirt of the not quite accurately labeled Sunnydale, Alanna was ready to go anywhere.  She was hoping it was somewhere with a shower, so when she was deposited on the front porch of a coffee house?  Not very amused, no.  But she did go in anyway.  ""Hello?""

Dora was leaning against the counter when she came in. The coffee house was a pretty standard coffee house, except for the specials board that read

<b>SPECIALS</b>

* Chupacabralatte

* Bigfoot 22-oz espresso

* Yeti cannolli

""If you want to use the bathroom, you'll have to buy something,"" Dora said. ""Or I'll take a song and dance number if you're strapped for cash.""

""If I do a song and dance number, you'd probably be giving me money to get it to stop quicker.""  Alanna informed her and read the specials board.  And then she read it again.  ""How did you get the yeti into the cannolli?""  It seemed like a logical question. 

""I make Faye do it,"" she replied, wondering if she really could get Faye to fight a yeti for enough money. Then she could get people to place bets and make an event of it. ""Did you get into a fight or fall into a dumpster?"" 

""Which one gets me access to your sink faster?""  Alanna asked, trying to find where the money she had shoved into her pocket had gone and reading the menu again in a desperate hope that some it would sound a little less...scary.

""Go on,"" Dora said, jerking her head towards the door that led to the restrooms. ""I won't be a stickler on the 'customers only' thing, but you'd be doing me a favor if you bought a coffee. It's been a slow enough day that I sent my employees home and I'm so bored I was thinking of redecorating the walls with mocha and cream. It'd be a pain to keep having to repaint every time the walls went sour.""

""I'll buy something once I remove the sand from my teeth.""  Alanna promised her.  ""Try it without the cream maybe?""

""The walls or your coffee?"" 

""Both.""  Alanna informed and went rinse the dust off of her face and teeth in the desperate hope to feel a little more human and a little less human-dustball.  ""So um, can I get the first one that no person can pronounce without breaking teeth?""  She asked, coming back out.

""One chupacabralatte coming right up."" Dora made herself busy and pulled a coffee mug with a text face on it from the shelves to pour the drink into. ""I'll charge you for the coffee, but the mug is on the house. You look like you've had a day where you need a smiley face mug.""

Alanna rummaged in her pocket and produced a enough money to cover the coffee.  ""Thanks.  If you ever feel the urge to visit Sunnydale?  Don't.  Free advice."" And that's how Alanna spent the remainder of her trip with a smiley face mug for company.

It was kind of the opposite that was driving Alanna to the edge of her ability to keep on smiling.  She had gone riding with the young men every single day, but even that did not seem to be far enough.

So one morning, half on a lark, she left her horse with one of the lads, grabbed a spare change of clothes, wound up grabbing a lot more food than she meant to due to a very friendly woman, and set out to put some space between herself and the village.  She had meant to go to Fandom, really. But somehow, she just wasn't specific.  And the universe really does have a sense of humor."

Usual disclaimer goes: plot stolen from Tamora Pierce's Lioness Rampant, though with edits.  But before that, I'd like to give a huge thank you to my co-conspirators <lj user=""kawalsky""> and <lj user=""tricksy_spy""> without whom this would have been a paragraph written on a cocktail napkin with a stick figure for an icon.  You guys rock, and not only for your awesome coding skills.  This has been two years in the making and it's been a wild ride.  I'd link to all the posts that led us here, but I only have about forty minutes and the list would go into the three digits.  So...here we are.  The Coronation of King Jonathan.

"event","Unlike Alanna's usual letters, this one was not written on crisp parchment in careful handwriting.  This one could barely pass for a letter, more of a note really.  It was a bit crumpled as well, as if the person writing had dug her nails into the side to hold on to something, and the letters were dark and bounced over the page, as if the person writing was gripping the quill too hard and had a hand that was shacking a bit too much.  It was also covered in ink blots and random scratch outs.  She also forgot to sign it.

From her position along the wall near the altar, Alanna watched with pride as the Mirthan priest and the Priestess of the Goddess, acting as one, blessed the silver crown and then Jonathan, who knelt before them. She was grateful that her duties didn't call for her participation in this part of the ceremony. After keeping vigil with Jonathan all night, she was sleepy. Somehow repeated yawns did not seem right for such a memorable occasion. Instead, until it was time to present Jonathan formally with the Jewel, all she had to do was stay put and look impassive.

On her left, Gary and Raoul did the same. Raoul winked as Alanna covered a yawn. Unlike the King's Champion, the Knight Commander spent the night in bed, disturbed only by his nerves. But nerves were enough and he had about as little sleep as Alanna had. Jon's safety today was the responsibility of the King's Own and that was more than enough to give him a restless night.

Myles surveyed the event from the audience. Eleni, Thayet, Buri and Rispah had accompanied him, but his attention was not on them, despite the ladies wearing their finest. He glanced around casually, barely even noticeable to anyone else in the audience, and located Dukes Baird and Gareth, Sirs Douglass, Geoffrey and Sarcherell, George Cooper looking like one of the King's Own and Charles Kawalsky dressed up like one of the many visitors to the city. He wasn't surprised to see that Alanna's brother wasn't present. Thom was always caught up in his own work. The two absences that made him very cautious of his surroundings were Duke Roger and Sir Alexander. He knew from his work leading up to the coronation that something was amiss and that there were things out of place. He was sorry to say that they hadn't managed to fully uncover a plot to disrupt the events, but that didn't mean they weren't ready should anything untoward happen.

Halfway towards the front along the side, Charlie watched in silence. He stifled a smile as Alanna tried to hide another yawn and pay attention to the ceremony. He'd never been one for formal events. The crowd was of more interest. His exposure to Corus society had been varied, with George's associates and Jonathan's knights sitting at opposite ends of the scale, but to see the mixture of different people all in the one place was something new. To the front, the nobles watched, knowing that their world was changing and not all were convinced it was for the better. In the middle, wealthy merchants tried to look important and caught glimpses at the nobles in between watching the ceremony. At the back, those who were able to cram in who weren't of noble blood or great fortunes were just glad to be there, taking in the sight of something they knew wouldn't be seen again for generations. They all had one thing in common. Their attention was on Jonathan and the crown was about to be placed on his head, binding him to the land. That was something worth dressing up for.

A halt in the chanting brought Alanna's eyes back to the altar, just as the crown was lowered onto Jonathan's head. Immediately it sparked and glowed, the magic of the land reaching down to envelop the new King. People gasped in awe as Jonathan flared with brilliance; they knew the joining of Tortall and King was complete. Smiling, Alanna touched the ember at her throat. Jonathan was brilliant with the crown's silver glow, his own magic showing through as threads of sparkling blue. She looked down, and felt sick. The floor of the chamber was awash in blood-colored fire. ""Jonathan!"" she yelled as the earth moaned and shook. Sudden pain, combined with the vibration beneath her, knocked Alanna to her knees. For a moment she could only clutch her belly and scream with agony. It receded, then flared again.

 

In the hall, chaos reigned. From the vaulted ceiling mortar dust and chips of stone fell, an ominous hint of the destruction that could occur. Charlie fought his way through the crowd towards the front of the room. People screamed in fear as the ground rolled underfoot like a ship at sea.

 

Alanna was deaf and blind to it all. The pain was grinding: she felt as if every nerve in her body was being pulled out through her skin. <i>Thom,</i> she realized, struggling to get up. <i>Something's happening to Thom, and I can feel it. I have to go to him!</i>

 

Even amongst the screams and cries of the panicked crowd, the order from the King's Champion could be heard. ""Guard the king!"" Then she was gone.

Dear everyone,

My apologies for the long pause.  Things have been hectic and a little insane.  I returned home from wandering outside of Tortall to discover things have changed.  I honestly don't even know where to begin.

Princess Thayet, of she who wrote that letter for me, and her bodyguard wound up accompanying me, Liam, and Coram back to Corus.  I don't know what I expected to find upon arrival, but it was definitely not the news that the King and Queen were dead, and Prince Jonathan is to be crowned King.

My twin brother Thom has been at court while I was away.  He brought back Duke Roger of Conte.  Yes, brought back from the dead.  I know that man is up to no good, but there is no proof.  He has no magic (or so he claims and I see none as well) and is staying out of all plots.  But I know that he has something up his sleeve.  Thom has been...unwell.  George and I have got one of his old Masters, Master Si-Cham, to come and help him uncorrupted his Gift.  As his twin, I'm currently dealing with about twice as much magic as I usually have.  It feels like a constant hangover, but everything should be fixed by the end of the week.

Speaking of George, he has been granted the title of Baron of Wintershore.  That was one of the more amusing fights of the past few months.  He grudgingly accepted the title and might not be running off as soon as Jon is King.

What a strange thing to write...I did not think that Jon would be king for, well, a long, long time.  But he will be crowned this week.  I can't describe the mood here, in the capital, but it is not a happy one.  People are worried, and there have been riots.  No one wants a Dead Duke riding around, nor a twenty year old Master.  Nor a woman knight, who's been named King's Champion.  There was never a female Champion, not even when women could be knights.  Jon's choice will not bring him many friends, though those who know me and him seem to agree.  I think they're all mental, but apparently, my opinion is not being counted here.

There is a crazy princess running around.  She was supposed to be engaged to Jon, but that fell apart.  Now, she's just running around, throthing.  I might be exaggerating.  But it seems that I was right to bring Thayet with me, she and Jon seem quite interested in each other.  And she doesn't let him be the snoot he can be for very long.

Speaking of new faces around here, I quite literally ran into Charlie Kawalsky.  If anyone has misplaced him?  He's here, refusing to go home even though he might have an errant sword aimed at him.  At least he's no longer falling under the horse.  

I don't know what else to say.  Someone told me that the Coronation is a cross-road in time.  People are excited, nervous.  I'm just waiting to see what happens.  The best I can come up with is dread.  It feels like this is what I have been working for.  Where I have been going my entire life.  I guess we'll see how it goes.

Faithful sends his love.
Alanna.

Aly,

I know you know how this ends, but I don't.  I hope, I hope that whatever happens this week, you will still turn out the amazing young woman I got to know.  

Goddess Bless,
Alanna.

Xander and Bridge,

Sorry for missing your wedding!  The invitation has just arrived!  I can not stress the congratulations enough!  I promise that as soon as things settle down a little here, I'll stop by.

Alanna.

Alanna leaned over the rail of the ship as her insides heaved overboard...yet again.  

""Some might feel pity for you.""  Faithful said smugly from behind her.

""Shut up.""  Alanna said, glaring over her shoulder.

""I didn't say I do."" Faithful pointed out.  ""I just said that some people do.""  

""Like me.""  Thayet said, joining Alanna on deck and passing the sick knight a wet cloth and a glass of water.  ""The cook might have some scraps for you.""  She informed the cat.  With a thankful yowl, Faithful ran off below deck.

Alanna collapsed next to Thayet on a low bench with a groan. ""No more boats.  Next time?  I'll walk if I have to.""

Thayet chuckled and tucked one knee under her chin.  ""It must be strange for you, finally heading home.""

""It won't feel like home.""  Alanna said softly.  ""I haven't been there for so long.  And with the King and Queen gone and ... Thom.  And ... Thom.""  She summarized eloquently.  ""I was at school for two years on top of that.""

Thayet turned towards the smaller woman.  ""I didn't know that.""

Alanna nodded, her eyes on the stars.  ""Even the stars are different...I used to wonder, if you just kept going, would you hit Tortall?  Or if we kept going...would we hit Fandom?""

Thayet nodded, not commenting.

""I miss them, you know?  I used to get letters, but that was different.  It's not that I don't like you.""  Alanna managed a small smile.  ""It's just...I grew up with these people.  I went to war with some of them, and battled zombies and vampires with the others.  And now I'm coming home.  Only ... it's going to be different.  So different.""

""You'll be fine.  You have friends there.""  Thayet tried to casually cover up her own worries.  ""The world doesn't change that quickly.""

""I changed."" Alanna said softly.  

Thayet grinned.  ""Then I think you just figured out the meaning of life.""  

""To give me a headache?""

""Exactly.""  Thayet stood up.  ""I'm going down below deck.  Have Faithful get me or someone if you pass out.""  

Alanna glared at Thayet's retreating back.  Once the princess was gone, Alanna re-settled on the bench and glanced up at the stars, tracing the familiar constellations.  Almost without thought, she pulled out a folded <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/fandomhighdorms/1003571.html?thread=82485043#t82485043"">photograph</a> from her pocket.  She would deny under torture that there were tears in her eyes.

"event","Alanna was sitting on the bed, growling at the world, her hands covered in bandages.  Thayet was somewhat more amused, parchment spread out on the writing desk and a quill ready to go.  

""It could be worse.""  Thayet said, getting ready to take diction.  Alanna simply glowered some more.  Thayet wisely chose to turn to her work.  ""All right.  Let's hear it.""

Dear everyone still at Fandom High and the alumni who are not there,

I'm actually unable to write so this letter is being dictated to the lovely Thayet who is sacrificing her free time to help out a silly friend who decided against using her brain.  (That's not quite what Alanna said, but it's close enough.)  The last month has been somewhat eventful.  (Somewhat?  What's eventful for you?)  Vampires in the sewers, jello dragons, aliens at graduation... (...What?  I'm just writing everything she says.  Except that.  I don't think that's anatomically possible.) 

Anyway, Liam, Coram, and myself set out following the map I got from a friend of Sir Myles and ran into a group of refugees from Sarain.  Including the war lord's daughter.  (Ex-warlords, he got killed.)  I think the official stance is that it was a heart attack.  (My father may have done many things but he didn't die of a heart attack.) ANYWAY.  Faithful, stop snickering.  We dropped off the children at a convent so that they could be returned to their parents but Thayet and her body guard Buri continued with us to the Roof of the World.

(She left out the part where there was a baby.  Since the lady knight's cooking is borderline harmful, Buri suggested she take baby-sitting duty.  And by suggested I mean shoved the baby in her arms and told her to change him.  I don't think I've ever seen such terror.  And then the baby threw up on her.) Lies.  All lies.  

It turns out the Roof the World is cold.  (I agree with Faithful, that is stupid.)  No, not really.  I think almost everyone knows how much I love the cold.  And not only was it cold, but there was a blizzard closing off the pass.  So I took initiative and headed up before the snow cleared since it would just keep coming anyways.  (In other words, she proved that sometimes she is a lot like a guy and didn't use her brain.)  I did too.  Since when are things easy?  I figured I'd at least fight on my own terms.  And I did, fight, and I won.  Sort of.  I don't think there really was a win in that situation.  But I got the Dominion Jewel.  And the healers are confident I'll regain use of my hands eventually.  (Sadly, I can't quite transcribe the expression on Faithful's face, but I'm fairly certain it mirrors my own.)

Enough about me.  (In other words, ""I can't possibly sound stupider"".) How have things been back at Fandom?  Ready for graduation?  Ready for whatever decides to show up to graduation?  No blowing up the school!  (What did you do?) It wasn't me.  I miss everyone and I hope to see you at either the wedding or graduation.  I'm heading home.  Somehow.  There might be a boat involved.  (Did you know that Alanna suffers from horrible motion sickness?) Yes they did. 

I miss everyone, yes, even you Jamie.  Hope you're all safe and sane.  (You aren't.  Sane.)  It was a logical solution!  (In what universe?)

See you soon,
Sir Alanna of Trebond and Olau.  (Transcribed by the ever patient Thayet jin Wilima who has to put up with a pouting Dragon and a crazy Lioness.)  Thayet's also a princess.  (What does that have to with your insanity/stupidity?) I'm just pointing it out.

</lj-cut>
Alanna was still glaring and set the letter off with her usual spell.  ""What?""

""Do you miss them?""  Thayet asked, geustering widely.

""The use of my hands?  Of course I do.""  Alanna said dryly.

Thayet shot the other woman a look, but didn't press.  ""Heal up quickly, we'll ride out in a few days.""

""You could just tie me to the horse.""

"event","Alanna was not in a good mood.  An early riser, by noon she was still not awake.  Faithful's smug expression and Coram's ribbing were helping exactly none.  The fact that Liam Ironarm was the one to catch her one and only fall off of a horse and into the mud had a lot to do with her bad mood to begin with.  The Great Mother Goddess showing up on her pre-dawn ride just fed the headache she felt rattling in her skull.  When Faithful gave up with subtle and simply threw the parchment and quill at her, Alanna snarled and grabbed them to write, mostly to have something to do other than polishing and sharpening her sword.

<lj-cut text=""To whom it may concern..."">

Dear Fandom High residents and alumni and Jamie Madrox,

I have not vanished off of the face of the planet, been eaten by wild rabbits, nor turned in a turtle.  I have however left my birth country for the first time and have found our neighbors to be ... very similar to us.  I'm not that shocked.  If people a couple universes and thousands of years in the future can be similar, why can't next door neighbors?

Since my last letter I've sort of fixed my sword, didn't save the Shaman who gave me the idea how to fix it, and got restless in the desert.  I've also participated in a tournament, which was possibly one of the funnier things I've ever seen.  One of my very pissed off opponents was arguing that as a girl I was not allowed to beat him up.  Turns out there isn't a rule about girls not competing - as long as you're a knight, you're fine.  On top of that, he didn't have many friends so I think I came out on top.  Jousting really isn't my thing though, too small and light.  I fly easy.  Fencing on the other hand...well, that was fun.

I've also seemed to have picked up a quest for myself.  Which is a life long dream, right there.  Like any good quest, it's complicated, hard, and has more clauses then a ten page paper written the night before.  Coram glared at me when I asked if he wanted to go back to Rispah and made it clear that I've been hit on the head a time too many.  I could use the company.  Human company. The talking cat doesn't count.  

I've also met the Shang Dragon - Liam Ironarm - the other day.  It's a huge honor.  I've never met any of the Shang - we always seem to miss each other by a day, and to meet the most famous of them all?  An honor.  And an experience.  He's very nice on the eyes.  OW!  Faithful is making me add that I fell off of my horse into the mud in front of him.  And now I'm bleeding on the parchment and it's the cat's fault.  

I'm going to visit a friend of Si-my father's (and isn't that odd to write) tomorrow to see what the lovely quest thing I have is exactly about.  I'm always up for an adventure.

Rory, Anakin, I'll try to make it for your wedding, but I can't make any promises.  I have no idea where I'll be come May.  Jamie?  NO.  Everyone else?  I hope you're having a wonderful time where ever you are.  Write and tell me all about it!  And about everything happening in Fandom.  I miss everyone very much.  Sadly, I probably won't get your responses until well, Rory and Anakin's wedding, actually, but write anyway or I'll start making up stuff.  

Yours, 
Sir Alanna of Trebond and Olau.

P.S. I keep dreaming of my twin and Duke Roger and Tortallian royalty.  I think my subconscious has finally lost it.  Thoughts?

After the letter burned down to ash, Alanna turned towards her cat.  ""Happy?"" ""Meow."" Alanna's response was far less polite, however, she did have to admit that she felt somewhat more cheerful.  With that thought, she set off downstairs to find her man-at-arms.

Dear Everyone,

"event","When George returned after his trip to Chorus, he brought a note from the young sorcerer along with a stack of letters from Fandom, to Alanna's delight.  Thom's short letter, along with the odd questions from her friends, did plenty to alleviate her fear of something going seriously wrong and she set to replying to her post.

<lj-cut text=""Xander"">
Dear Xander,

Yes, without shrimp.  I tried to get some for Faithful when it became evident that we were in the wrong Virginia and they had no shrimp.  Your mother?!  You're not even a student!  And oy, maybe you can avoid telling her?  Since she evidently didn't die in her world?  

I don't the shamanettes is a real word, and they're actual Shaman's now and wow, how in the world did that happen?  I have actually considered duck-tapping the thing together, but somehow I doubt it would hold.  I probably will wind up in Fandom again at some point, since I apparently can't stay in one place for more than a few months.  

Er, yeah, sorry about that.  My twin decided to run some experiments and I was close enough for them to affect me.  And no disappearing!  I know!  I was worried!

In no way time slipped,
Alanna.

P.S. Thanks for getting Bridge to respond!  And...mime?  
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Bel"">
Dear Bel,

WHAT?!  How/why/what is he under arrest?  Never mind, I'll write to him myself.

And yup, sticking with the Belthazor express from now on.  I don't think Faithful has ever complained quite that loudly.  

Er...blame Thom.  He was running some experiments and well, I freaked out when my letters weren't getting sent.  So I tried again.  And again.  And again.  And a few more times.  Sorry about that.

Learning not to trust Portalocity,
Alanna.

P.S.  Good to hear she's gone.  No, don't need anyone beaten up, though George did volunteer to threaten Thom a bit.

Parker,

Brother is a moron.  I don't want to talk about it anymore.  A new friend?  Did you at least leave him your number?  How's Oxford?  What are you studying?  Where is that anyways?

Port Caynn is lovely, and near enough for Chorus for me to get my mail but far enough to be well, far enough.  Do you remember George Cooper?  It's sort of his?  I honestly didn't ask for any details.  I figure if I don't know, I can deny all knowledge in front of the Provost.  Jon is back in Chorus after becoming the Voice of the Tribes.  He's going to be King, and I'm going to be that knight that goes off and does crazy things.  Like turn out to be a girl.  

I'll pass on your greetings, however, I doubt it will be any time soon.  I'm still not very popular back in the capital.

Suddenly craving cheese,
Alanna.

<lj-cut text=""Isabel"">
Dear Isabel,

Yup, no shrimp.  He spent the next week complaining.  I'll hold you to that!  Also, how are the dresses?  Not pink or poofy, right?  

From what I hear, they needed the support.  Xander's mother?  What was that about?  I don't know, do you know a George Cooper?  Where are you applying for college?  (Not that I'll know any of them, but at least I can pretend to know what you're talking about?)

And yeah, I'm fine. Thom's a moron.

Scritching the cat from you,
Alanna.

P.S. I'm sorry about Antar.  I can always try seeing if there's a way from my world?  Not that's any help...
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Bridge"">
Dear Bridge,

It's nice to finally hear from you!  I don't think I want to know what the shower thing is about, especially if Xander's mom was in any way involved.

I probably could send it to you...if I was currently on speaking terms with the brat.  However,  all attempts to fix it have involved explosions and minor acts of destruction.  There simply doesn't seem to be a way to fix it with any normal method.  I am open to ideas of other ways to mend it though!

Yeah, I'm not really sure how the school thing happened.  Someday, I will look back on this and laugh.  And laugh.  And then laugh some more until someone finally calls for a healer.

Glad to finally hear from you,
Alanna.

Dear Aeryn,

I yours is the first bachelorette party that I've heard of where the shots were of bullets and not alcohol.  I'm sorry I missed it.  And you'd be suprised, there would not have been mocking of the veil.  I can be very traditional when pressed.  Shocking, I know.  

And I'll be there.  In two weeks.  With no random detours to the land of no shrimp.

Looking forward to your wedding,
Alanna.

Hi to you roommate!  Trust me, she could have flipped out more.  And I'll be sure to do that at the nearest opportunity.  Parker in the desert.  Tell me there's photos.  After sending out that letter, the total number of tents killed went up to ten.

Hoping college is interesting,
Alanna

"event","The journey and time catching up with her old friend left Alanna far more tired then she expected.  Curling up in the room that had been allocated to her, the girl got out her writing utensils and Faithful got comfortable on her lap.  Before she began, she paused.  The odd sensation of power radiating from Chorus that she had been feeling for the past week had not disappeared.  Instead, it felt like it was getting stronger.  With a shake of her head, Alanna began to write.

<lj-cut text=""Dear everyone,"">
Hey,

Sorry for the long delay.  I tried to make it for Homecoming but Portalocity deposited me in a world without shrimp.  I think Faithful is still traumatized.  How was Homecoming?  And Parent's Weekend?  Everyone still sane and alive?  Or well, at least no more insane then they were to begin with?

I've moved on from the desert to a friend's house in Port Caynn.  Prince Jonathan had become the new Voice of the Tribes and had to go back to Chorus, my students had become full Shamans, and my school was in capable hands, so there was no reason for me stick around.  Lightning is still broken.

Sorry, I don't have the last batch of letter yet, I haven't been back to Chorus and no one has visited me from there.

Hope you're all okay,
Alanna.

Dear Aeryn,

Sorry I missed your party.  I hope you had fun and didn't get arrested.  I'll see you at the wedding.

Alanna waited for the ink to dry before letting the letters fall into the flame.  A moment later, the letters were back in her lap.  She ogled the flame, the letters, and Faithful, who was fascinated by a ball of string he had found.  A second try left her in the same position, with the letters still on her lap and not going through.

""Well, that's not good.""  She informed her cat.  He meowed his agreement.

"event","Alanna knew that Homecoming was on the first weekend of October.  She had booked a portal well in advance, and made sure she had appropriate clothing both for the other world and the dance.  Her two apprentices were no longer apprentices and were actually the new Shamans.  The world would not stop if she took an evening to go see people she hadn't seen since May.  At least, that's what she told Faithful.  The cat informed her he'd go as long as he got fed and there were no bows with ten miles of him.  All arrangements made, Alanna set off for Fandom.

None of this explained why she was now standing, staring at the body of water in front of her, blinking a lot.

""They moved the school.""  She finally told Faithful who was napping on her shoulder.

""Huh?""  The cat blinked as he awoke and stared at the water with Alanna.  ""Or you wound up in the wrong place.""

""I hope not, I don't think I have enough money for transportation more than a state away.""  Alanna informed the cat and waved down a passerby.  ""Excuse me, where am I?""

The man gave the girl who had been talking to herself a wide berth as he replied, ""Alexandria, Virginia.""

""...Oh.  Was there ever a large boarding school here?""  Alanna asked, trying to figure out what went wrong.

""...No.""  The man quickly walked away.

""That didn't work right.""  Alanna summarized.

""You noticed.""  Faithful commented.  ""Is it lunch time now?""

Alanna sighed.  ""Yes, lunch time, there's a restaurant right there.""  The girl and cat made their way in and Alanna decided to order something for her companion.  ""Excuse me, what do you have with shrimp in it?""

""Shrimp?""  The waiteress looked blankly at Alanna.

""Yeah, shrimp.  Little animals, live in the ocean?""  Alanna said, exasperated.

""Lady, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Anything you want that's actually a real food?""  The waitress said with a sigh and glanced down at Alanna, impatient.

""Something with tuna, then.""  Alanna said quickly.  After the waitress left, she glanced down at her bag.

""No Fandom.  No shrimp.  Worst world ever.""  Her bag informed her.  Alanna agreed."

"event","Alanna sat curled up in her tent, absentmindedly petting Faithful and staring a little absentmindedly at the bandage on her forearm.

<i>A little to the left.</i>  Faithful purred.  <i>And it shouldn't bleed through, so stop being emo at it.</i>

""I'm not ... I'm just thinking things through, that's all.""  Alanna paused.  ""And please never use that word again.  Especially about me.""

<i>If the shoe fits...</i>  Faithful said smugly.  <i>Do something useful, reply to those letters Myles and Jonathan brought down, try out your new name, scratch my other ear...</i>

Alanna obediently began scratching the other ear and glanced over at the letters that had been lying on what passed for her desk for a few weeks now.  ""I can either write or scritch, so make a desicion.""

<i>Both</i>. Faithful purred stubbornly and refused to move from Alanna's lap.  With a sigh, the girl reached for a quill and began to write.

Dear Parker,

Three people to a room?  Ouch.  I would have gone to Africa.  But I'm currently in the desert, so there may be some bias here.  I'm sorry for all the ink drops, Faithful won't move off of my lap.  He says you owe him three portions of shrimp now.  He's been keeping track, the spoiled thing.  OW!

Well, it's not a physical school, just a bunch of Shaman's and Apprentices <s>blowing up tents</s> trying out new spells.  I do things and then other things sort of happen. 

Prince Jonathan and Sir Myles are visiting, but I'll have more to say in my general letter.

Goddess bless,
Sir Alanna of Olau.

Dear Bel,

You do realize that that kind of a note makes me want to take the first portal I can back to school and figure out what's wrong?  Are you still in school?  Do the asses still need to be kicked?  If yes, I'm somewhere in the Great Southern Desert in Tortall, I'm not sure if you can do your transportation thing here or not.  If not, what was going on?

The desert is nice and warm.  I wish I knew more people who weren't expecting something from me.

My best regards,
Sir Alanna of Olau.

<lj-cut text=""Isabel"">
Dear Isabel,

...There were dinosaurs?  What exactly am I missing while I sit here, learning a lot about magic and becoming very, very tan?  What happened with ... Antar?  

Dresses that hide weapons are good.  I'd be suprised if Aeryn had it any other way.  Oh, please remind who ever is buying them that with my lovely hair and eye color combination I look funny in some colors.  And I'm still short.  

Faithful misses you too.  OW!  All right, he doesn't miss you.  But I do.  I hope everything is going well.

Goddess Bless,
Sir Alanna of Olau.

<lj-cut text=""Aly"">
Dear Aly,

Hush, or you're getting the lump of wool that is...something.  If you use your imagination, it can pass as a blanket.

When you said that part of your ""last name"" was Olau, I wondered if Myles had any children.  I ... don't know what I assumed, I came up with a rather long list of ways that you could be his granddaughter.  I never imagined that it was because he adopted <i>me</i>.  I'm sure you already know this happened.  I'm thrilled, but a part of me is frustrated that now I have <i>no</i> clues as to who your father is.  Stop laughing.  Another part of my brain is wondering if you're writing to ... future me?  But then I get a headache.

Do you know how I accidentally started a magic school?

Goddess Bless, 
Sir Alanna of Olau.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Everyone, even Jamie!"">
Hey everyone,

It's been a while, but there hasn't been much to write about lately.  The magic school I accidentally started is growing.  We were asked to move away from the main settlement after a recent spell knocked over six tents.  Lightning is still broken, even after that attempt.  At least his replacement isn't acting up as much as usual.  

Sir Myles of Olau and Princes Jonathan are visiting for a while.  There's a lot of complicated reasons for Jonathan's visit, all of which give me a headache.

Sir Myles, on the other hand, came here to ... name me as his heir and legally adopt me.  At 19.  Since Thom has no interest of managing the lands, Trebond has been put in Coram's ""care"".  Officially. Unofficially, he's been running it since before my father died, so not much changes.

How have things been at school?  I got some odd messages and I hope everything is all right.  I miss everyone.  As does Faithful.  When he's not clawing at my arm to make me write faster.

Take care,
Sir Alanna of Olau.
</lj-cut>

After the last letter was finished, Alanna shook out her wrist and glanced down at her cat.  ""Happy now?""

<i>Are you?</i>  Faithful said, glancing up until purple eyes met purple eyes.  Alanna paused for a long moment.

""Yes.""

"event","Alanna sighed, suddenly feeling tired and old. ""I'll teach all of you in the morning,"" she promised. ""For now, let's turn in.""

Obedient as always, her apprentices left, chattering eagerly. Once they were gone, Faithful jumped onto Alanna's left shoulder (his favorite perching-spot). 

""That was an interesting display of temper,"" he commented. ""Why don't you pick on someone who can fight back?""

""He's got to learn,"" Alanna replied, dousing all the lamps but one. ""Otherwise he's going to insult some little old wrinkled lady shaman who will tie him in knots.""

""Perhaps, the cat replied.

""Not just 'perhaps,' "" Alanna demurred. ""You know as well as I do that there are traps for sorcerers in the strangest places. At least I know I mean no harm. Someone else might not be kind.""

""You won't always be able to stand between another person and his fate,"" Faithful warned. ""You mustn't think you can look after the world.""

Alanna chuckled and tugged her pet's long black tail. ""Who will look after it if I don't?""

Faithful gave a disgusted mutter and stuck his cold nose into her ear, surprising a laugh from her as Alanna reached for her writing utencils.

<lj-cut text=""Dear everyone at Fandom High and other related places..."">
<i>Dear Everyone, including Jamie,

I hope Fandom is getting rebuilt at a faster rate then my sanity is.  I wager by now there must have been something odd happening.  Last time I said live furniture, and that did happen.  Talking animals perhaps so that I'm not the only one who must suffer.  Hey, I needed that blood!

Things have more or less calmed down.  I'm now Shamman and desperately training three new replacements for when I move on.  Yes, I'm already thinking of moving, or well, more precisely I know that I will want to move on soon and am making plans for when I do.  My students, how weird is that to write?, have managed to not kill anyone or each other, though Ishak needs to learn a lot more control and respect for women/everyone before he can take over.  He reminds me a lot of my brother, actually.  

I am still using the evil sword instead of my beloved, and still split in half, Lightning.  I have also decided to try to learn how to weave.  You can stop laughing now.  Any minute, really.  I'm horrible at it, no suprise there.  

Anyway, I miss everyone horribly.  There are no familiar faces around and I keep expecting to run into someone from school around every corner, but instead I just get raiders.  Coram should be arriving any day now so I should get a chance to read what you have written me soon.  You have written, right?  Faithful would now like to log a complaint saying that I do have a familiar face around: his.

Covered in a layer of fine sand, 
Alanna.</i>

On one letter, she added a post-script.
<i>Dear Charlie,

I have no idea where you are, but I'm certain that I have more sand than you.  You better have some interesting stories to tell.</i>
</lj-cut>

<font size=1>[ooc: So yes, another Alanna letter, again, if you wanted to get one, you did.  Any letters sent to Alanna before say...tomorrow noonish will get a responce from the red head herself.  If you miss the cut-off, well, you'll get a response from another red head.]</font>"

"event","After the events of the previous day, Alanna wasn't looking forward to facing ... well, pretty much anyone.  So before coming out of her new tent, she sat down to write.  Or at least try to write.

<lj-cut text=""To one daughter"">
<i>Dear Aly,

...My sword.  MY SWORD.  Did I mention my sword?  Because MY SWORD.  You could have warned me, really.  Well, no, no you couldn't, but still, my sword!

Alanna.</i>
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""To everyone else"">
<i>Dear person,

Hi, my name is Alanna and I'll be your person-who-accidentally-changed-the-world today.  I didn't mean to kill the previous shaman, he was trying to kill me and I was mostly fighting for my life.  You know that evil sword I mentioned?  It's really becoming a headache, but at least it's my headache now.  Oh, and um, I'm now the shaman of a small tribe of Bahzir in the desert.  Eventually, I will crawl out of my new tent and face people, but for now, letter writing.  I seem to get a lot less odd looks from parchment then from people.  Especially since the first thing I have to do this morning is convince the head of the tribe that it's okay for me to train two female (and one male) as replacements.  Someone, explain to me how I get in these messes.

Also, if the sudden urge to send anyone to check up on me strikes you, please don't.  They caught two of my friends spies lurking around, worried about my safety.  I have enough things causing me to hide under the sand without my well meaning friends adding.

I hate the fact that I'm not getting any mail from everyone back at school.  But Coram promised he'd bring back any post I got when he returns next month, so I look forward to hearing all about the dragons that decided to stop by while I was off getting covered in sand.

Faithful is still spoiled and sand covered and is in no way sending his love.

Alanna.</i>
</lj-cut>

Alanna paused before starting at an emtpy piece of parchment and putting it away.  

""Come on, we have to have the first of many odd conversations.""  The knight told her cat.  

<i>I'm busy.</i>  Faithful informed her and continued washing his paw.  Alanna rolled her eyes and headed out of the tent.

<font size=1>[ooc: Same as before!  If you wanted to get a letter from Alanna, you got one.  It appeared near whatever source of light/fire you had nearby.  Replies here are fine.]</font>"

"event","Alanna watched Coram and Hakim Fahrar ride away, their pack horse trailing behind.  Fingering the ember at her throat, she blinked her suddenly watery eyes.  Picking up Faithful, she entered her tent and for the first time in four weeks, began to write.

<lj-cut text=""A few letters"">
<i>Dear, well, pretty much everyone.

I should apologize for not writing sooner, but all the letters would have been ""Today we rode and there was sand.  Today we rode and Coram complained about my sanity.  Today we rode and Faithful complained that he has more sand then fur.""  And that wouldn't have been fun for anyone.  There are a few very important things I have learned in the past month.

1.  My brother is not a cat.  
2.  Sand is a crafty little bugger.
3.  When people call you a demon, your brain shouldn't go to strange places.  If someone is calling you a demon, you should be concentrating on blocking their spells, and not cracking up laughing in your head.
4.  I have the strangest luck.
5.  The cat is smarter than me.  (He made me add that.)
6.  That random guy you threw a coin to six year ago?  Will remember you and then vouch for you when you're in a very, very sticky situation.  It helps if you have red hair, purple eyes, a very large horse, and freed his people from a couple of prissy gods.  I don't make this stuff up, it just happens to me.
7.  That really smart guy you met six years ago?  Is the Voice of the Tribes.  What's a Voice of the Tribes?  Exactly.

In not so happy news, my beloved sword died a rather tragic death at the hands of a crazy hill raider's axe.  And then I nearly got killed by a tribe of Bahzir who later accepted me into their tribe once I knocked their star fighter out and refused to kill him.  The women sort of hate me because I refuse to wear a viel or be an obedient anything.  No, my life does not make sense.  Oh, and uh, does anyone have any experience with evil swords?  No reason, really.

I miss you guys.  (And running water.  And cell phones.  And refrigerators.  And did I mention the running water?)  How was John and Aeryn's engagment party?  How are the new kids?  Anyone do any more damage to the school?  Any more future children show up?  

Alanna.  (And Faithful.)</i>

Note at the of Charlie's letter: <i>I miss you.  There's a lot of sand and Coram grumbles a lot.  He also keeps asking a lot of questions about you which would frighten me, but he's mostly just talk.  I hope.  I also hope that you're having a wonderful time, where and whenever you are.  Yours, Alanna</i>

Alanna blew on the letters to dry the ink faster, and then let the candle burn them to ash.  Universes away, the letters formed on desks and chairs and anywhere else near fire or light sources, but Alanna's candle simply went out.  At least the darkness hid the tears running down her face.

<i>You're not alone.</i> Faithful reminded her and he got a tight, wet hug as an answer.

<font size=1>[ooc: So this was supposed to go up a week ago.  But then there was the whole ""arm in a splint"" thing, and yeah.  If you think you got a letter from Alanna, you did.  The letters suddenly appeared next to any open fire/flame or light source.  Feel free to have characters respond in comments.  All letters sent to Alanna will end up on her desk back in Chorus, so she's not getting them for a while.  But that doesn't mean your characters won't get responses.  Wow, long ooc note.]</font>"

She sat on her bed, Faithful on her lap, glancing around her room for the last time. The door was open for any last minute stragglers. Specifically, one straggler.

<lj-cut text=""Letter"">
<i>Greetings to Sir Alanna from Prince Jonathan Conte of Tortall.

Alanna,

Sir Miles tells me that your graduation approaches and that you are plan to ride South once you return.  Is there no way we can convince you to stay with us in Corus?  And before you decide I need my pride pricked, I would like to say that 'we' includes Sir Miles, Raoul, Gary, Alex, my parents, Uncle Gareth, and even George of course.  We all miss you dreadfully.  Raoul and Gary would like to point out that they don't even know Sir Alanna yet.  There's a lot of work here to do.  I know you want to hare off as a knight errant and cover yourself in honor and glory, but the Kingdom needs you, Alanna.  I need you.

If you're worried there's still a ruckus over the events at your knighting, it's starting to die down.  People are ready to accept you as a Lady Knight.  There's no need to prove yourself more.  You don't have to ride off into some type of continued exile. 

It's been a long two years without you.  And seeing you just those few times is much, much too little.  I hope to spend much more time with you soon.  Give Faithful a good scratch and some tuna.  And think about what I ask of you.

Your friend,
Love,
Jon

I cant tell you how many times i have just wanted to take like 60 pills and be done with it. And then I think of how fuckin pathetic that is and how when your about to go i bet you wish you didnt do it. Why take a cheap ticket to hell? Not Worth it. Plus I couldnt put that pain on my family. And then its like in a few years no one would remember me anyway. How shitty would that be. So the best thing is to take one day at a time and just deal with whatever comes your was. It is said that God never gives you anything you cannot handle, the hardest part is that you gotta have faith. And really7 I have so many people who are out there helping me its unreal. Although I wish it was my father who was helping me, just for the simple fact that out relaionship sucks right now. I dont know what it was thast i did or didnt do anyway write later i gotta go"

And I have decided for sure what I want to do with my life. I want to be a cop. A bad ass bitch cop. ha. I was inspired, mostly, I guess all by Javier. I want to work narcotics. after riding with him and having him show me pictures of places that they have busted and the kids in the situations, i want to help people. Of course fitness modeling would be cool too, but i want something with meaning, and to show everyone that i can do something like that.

I am tired of me, tired of doing what i do, and mostly i want to give up. alothough in the back of my mind i know that is not the answer. sometimes i want to just pretend like i am crazy. like i went totally psycho and nothing in the world matters anymore. i would take off in my car with just a few things, in my most comfortable clothes and whatever little money i had. then i would drive. drive to the end of the country if i had to. and i wouldnt care what happened to me. sometimes i want to disapear. see how people would react. i know i feel this way because i dont think people care about me. i mean i know they do but i want to see how much. sometimes i sit here and think thatmaybe i am realy crazy i just dont know it yet. i just havent had my episode. i havent had the moment where psycho switch gets flipped on. or maybe all of htis is jusy craving attention. figure this.. i am totally infactuated with javier, this cop i did work for. well hes married. we talk on the phone  alot but just as friends. so to gethis attention to be near me ( with my fantasy dream of seducing him) i have to play helpless. like on night when i was all fucked up on pills and alcohol, my uncle was out of town and i called him, told him i was freaked. so he came out. I dunno what it is about him, but i want him. i know i probably will never have him either. Ill tell you what i like to do. i like to get all fucked up on pills or drunk and write or record my thoughts. and thats it right there. that is what is going to make me a writer. step inside my head. what the hell is that from? its from a movie but i cant remember. anyway i can write but i just need to learn how to paint the picture ofwhat i see. i see some pretty fucked up things. i gotta go people are here and i am annoyed."

Ahh she has grown up to be one of the most awesome girls i know.I I am really glad she is coming back and doing what truly makes her happy and not what everyone else wants her to do. On my side i am having so many questions in my head about things. the one thing that is for sure is that i am not moving out of town for like umm years. Thomas wants me to comepte in about 6 months or so. I really need to get on the ball about my diet. I work out all the time but it doesnt mean that i can eat whatever i want. I am having problems dealing with my roomate. I dont think its gonna work out to much. Shes is so messy and i feel like i am picking up after a kid and really i cant take it.but there is not much i can do right now, since amanda is going to get aunt lisas room if she moves. but i dont think amanda will be here that much or long,since she will always be with alicia. i  wouldnt mind living here again, its so chill and i could focus on all my stuff and woulndt get bugged about having to go out or drink or any of that, and i wouldnt feel like i was living in a fetching pig stye. Ugh i dunno what to do. I gotta get out of that fuckin salon too, its driving me insane!! i will be at on the rocks this weekend.

I am going to write about this later cuz well i am tired but we do our thingm we get fuuuccked up, i end up not going to on the rocks to work ( dont know how i am going to explain that one) cuz Thomas says dont go i will pay your phone bill ( ahh??!!) so then we all go to Bobbys, we lose thomas'wallet with $700 fuckin dollars in it, i see all my friends and who knows what i was doin out there i dont remember, who the feck really cares anyway, but then thomas and rich get arrested, annette leaves so i am like i cant leave these guys in jail, i go talk to this cop on the corner about gettin them out, end up going on a mini ride along and scoring a deal that i cant ever tell anyone about, and no one would fuckin believe it. ( I hope i am doin the right thing) everything is kool i just need money and i didnt go to work, yet i dunno if i am cut out for that kind of shit. So anyway i get them out of jail early and they owe me their fuckin life cuz i didnt ditch them like a bitch would. ANyway its really crazy cuz the last two weeks so many oppertunitys have come my way its unreal and i am questioning why. i know i want to be a fitness model and trainier, i mean the two guy trainers and even tonya who i talked a lot to today say that i have it and i can be sucessful, but i look at what tonya does and all the other models on the website and their pictures are disgusting. i mean i could never go topless and look all erotic like they do. i mean it is worse than vitorias secret and thats not even bad. I guess that that is going to just be one part of my life though. I have so much growin up to do. But I signed a deal tonight. I cant say what its about, but it is taking me down a path that could lead to a career that i have thought about before. I dunno it sucs i cant say anything but why does God give us these oppertunitys if i shouldnt take them.i am trippin on tonight i mean soooo much happened u have no idea. at all. write later."

I dont care if i have to work every friday and saturday night as long as i get to train. Thomas belives in me so much and i have never belived in myself so much either. He even told me something that was between him and I , that if tonya leaves, which she has to move like every 3 years then i could buy my way into the business, and then we would open up more locations and then move it down south. Do you know how huge this could be. He said I knew I made the right choice with you and how awsome is it that we foundd each other? he is the top trainer in fresno and was in all of california for two years. And here i am with so much drive he says and good genes and just an all around beautiful girl. hes going to make me into something and i just cant wait. this is what i have been waiting for.
I just talked to rick. he is coming home like on thursday night and says he is going to come to my club. I dont think i want to see him though. I cant have any distractions right now, its just not healthy for me and thats all guys are right now would be a distractions. If i cant come home to him every night and have a life, then i dont want to be with him. Anyways i am going to make a life for myself, fuck guys man, seriously its all about me now. I cant see him. it will hurt to much and to see his family, its this vicous cycle that we go through and i need to be done with it. just done. how am i going to tell him that? I have no idea.

Working out is like almost all i do. its all i think about. And now, i have filled that space where i have always thought i needed a guy. now i dont want anyone, just to make myself happy and do what i need to do. Thomas has totally changed me and given me the oppertunity to do something i never thought i could do. hes going to make me into a fitness model. you know those girls you see in ads for xenadrine and hydroxycut, those ripped girls, ( not the manlooking thing though) just totally fit and no fat on them. thats what i am going to be. He belives in me so much that he is takeing his work time where he makes so much money to train me for free. And he truly belives that i am going to win. he says no more than 6 months and i am going to be able to compete. Do you know what it feels like to have someone believe in you that much. I have so much potential for this. Many people have said they can see me doing this. and now i have the oppertunity. Screw college, its not for me. I dont want to sound concieted but seriously, i should use my looks to make me money. then i can change someones life like thomas has changed me. people are going to look and me and be like damn she has a nice body but i want them to be like that girl is tough. look what she does. and when i get there its going to feel so great, and i cant wait. I have sworn off guys while i am training. I dont need that distraction in my life right now, some guy makin me sick worrying, of any thing. all i want is me and to suceed. I finlay have found something now i have to work on balancing the rest of my life and finding out who i am and just how i am going to get there. this is only step one."

I just do. and then erika said something along the same lines and i was like oooo fuck. so we went to dinner with ryan tonight, it was kinda werid. and then he said he was going to call me when he got home from the gym whicj should have been at about 11. but o what the fuck ever. Why do i even care, Thea and her HOT friend tom came over last night. he said i was cute. she totally wants to hook me up with him, but the thing is that ya she has a boyfriend but then she also slept with him but she soo says its ok if i go out with him. i dunno bout that. hold on i am gonna load a bowl. ok that hit was enough. so i would kinda feel weird and well he totally seems like my type. ok i dont know what my type is. i am afraid to say it might notwork with ryan cuz hes a little differnt but then i dunno, maybe i am just used to guys callin me all the time and seein each other every other day and shit and its not goin like that with him. seriously though, the money thing was a huge plus, but who the fuck has like a million bucks and is truly mother f'in REALLY happy? I would so much rather struggle but be completly in love like with rick. or just to finally open the fuck up and be myself. I need to get out of this town. My mom is a bitch, or i should sya karna. I mean i thought i had the best mom when i was little, and i remember crying cuz i wanted to be with her, now its like fuck i dont want anything to do with you. and she has the damn nerve to say no matter what has happend in the past or what i did i am still your mother, fuck that. what i want to know is when am i going to get the balls to say fuck off the rest if my life. Never really had a mother, when it mattered anyway, then to learn that she was always on drugs and cheated on my dad and  i would see her and be afraid to talk to her, thats just sad,  then i think what am i complaining about, i know people who had been sexually abused and their parents hadnt done anything about it. ugh i am so mad right now. Why is it that i am so interested in guys and the rest of my life. If i took all the hours in the day that i used to think about guys and just getting married, shit if i put that to use for school,shit id be almost done.I want to focus on just myself but i get so lonley and bored, oh you want to hear something horrible? All f us girls rented a navigator limo for the night and i got so fucked up on xanis and alcohol that one i dont remember shit and then the other is that i called rick and said i love you baby. what the fuck was i thinking? i was soooo embarresed. anyway i was thinking about how much i just want to go and how pissed i am that it is 1230 and ryan hasnt called and who the fuck is he anyway. damn seriously i want to just fuckin be fuckin a bitch sometimes and i dont know why i am sayin this either its just i know if i sit here and wait he wont call, if i get ready for bed. he will. what fuckin ever i mean hes so wishy washy. well on sat night i gave my number to a cop at table moutain. from what i remember he was kinda hot and he called last night. hmm i kinda feel bad about casey but i mean it just wasnt working ya know and i would totally feel weird if i called him, anyway who cares, i still have a feelin rick is the one, by the way he called me and told me how much he missed me and shit. ugh i dont want tommorow to come. i want to go to the game with ryan but he hasnt asked me again and then i kinda wanna bei dont like him, i dunno i a little parinoid that he doesnt like me but why wouldnt he and i think i am just high or something but its time to go and i am going to move to west virgina but more on that the next time."

"event","So I have decided that that is going to be one of the titles for one of m books. If I ever get the nerve and time to write it. Well basically here it is. This all came to me within hours. I mean years of expirences just made sense to me today. So many lessons learned. Beware some of my deepest truest darkest secrets are going to come out in the next couple of enteries. So anyway I realised that the last four guys i have dated have seriously put me through some shit, but have all taught me something about life and falling in love. I should clarify though that the fourth one, the current one i should say, and hopefully the last ( i always say that) really has only added positve feelings, but we will get into that later. Whats even more crazy is that I had a connection with all of them today. One on the phone in San Diego, one on the phone in Texas, one I saw at the gym and the other, well I left his house this morning. 
Each one has made me feel like they are the one, that is until either one of us screwed up, got tired of eachother, or the most popular, I 'thought; I was in love with the other one. Some people would say that I just cant be alone, and you know what i think they are right. heres the deal. My life is a mess. I mean out of control. went to college, dropped out, had a great job, quit it. Was depressed for awhile, but now I am so damn happy i think its driving me nuts. I have dreams where I am in a car and its driving but i am not in the drivers seat. I am trying to get there, but i just havent., hence out of fuckin control. So I figure since my life is so undecided, the best thinkg to do is jump into someone elses and support theirs. That is why I just want to be married so bad. I want to find the one and just start a new life. Its funny cuz now i realize that I want a new family, my own since mine is so fucked up, for the most part. Anyway. out of these four guys i think two really have what it takes to for me to spend the rest of my life with them and be happy. So lets meet them shall we?
We will begin tonight with Dwayne, the three years romance that damn i wanted to work so bad, until the day he told me he loved me and i was over him. For three years I played the seccond fiddle to some other ugly jennifer and had no idea why i was doing that. Of course  saw other guys in there but he was diffrent"

No see well i dunno, Ryan is so attentive and romantic and hot and well lets just say if i was to marry him i would never ever have to work again. not that money is everything though. I have been thinking latley, i feel so out of place, i have been tryin to fit in so much and i realised that i am fuckin hella cool just as me. like with tryin to date casey, a cool edgy guy. nah, not my type. seriously i have looked at it and i really like dorks. ha, rick was one, and well erika and i decided that ryan was one to. but hes differnt. i dunno things will work out fine, but there is something on my mind that keeps popping up if ryan and i dont work. we havent been real safe if you know what i mean. ahh all this is nonsense right now  i am so dead, i gotta go. but really i am realizing that what amanda said was right. anyone who makes me feel like i would have to result to hurting myself is not fuckin worth it. how sad that it ended this way huh?"

Basically we made a proposal that when we do date someone, we think about what we really want in our future, basically, that we dont sleep with anyone else. I mean I love him and I cant stand it. We talked again today and just said it sucks how we miss each other so much but  know we cant do anything about it. Ahh and his mom said to him, "" I hope you know I am going to keep in touch with her becuase I really like her."" Ha. its all a matter of time.

Just to see me happy. Ugh He makes me siiickk, so much fuckin time I wasted and blew off way to many guys for him. no fuckin more its soo over. Anyway He hasnt treated me right in like so long and I want to call him and rage at him sooo bad but i cant do that cuz i am not psycho. I just want to be happy. I want to be me.

***To You**
You think you can do no wrong, like every dirty spot in our realtionship is a stain from me, something that you think you can get out, so you dont even try, you throw me here and there wondering what are you going to feel next. You think you are so smart. You take your psycho babble bull shit and apply it to everything in your life, overanalzing a mistake i made, that you, the perfect you made me do. and your so perfect and you dont even see that. Your blind to your true feelings. Your going to search for me in her, whoever she is, your ex who was stupind enough to sleep with you when you were thinking of me. And then you go backa nd forth trying to decide if you want me. But it doesnt work thatway anymore. Now that I am all cried out, You assume i have other intrests. And I do. I hope right now you are trying to figure out what you want out of life because if you were to talk about tommorow, even the next minute, you would be clueless and it probaly would change every five minutes. i cant live like that.I know what I want and while my whole life itsnt planned out, at least i TRY not to hurt people. I am not a liar and I am not a bitch. The worst part od writing this to you and realizing that its true, is that I still love you and I probably would take you back. Thats the only thing that makes me pathetic."

Can you belive that he didnt get me anything from new york? Not only that, he has been treating me like shit for like the past two months. There are so many other guys that would treat me like a queen. i am so confused, I dont know if i should hold on and make him see what hes missing or do i just say fuck it and leave the man whom i love sooo much? I am so lost its like we fight and when we see each other its all over we are in love again. I hate this. Love is sooo damn shitty.Why does this always happen to me though? I mean seriously I give everything of myself. Damn maybe i should just marry for money. Uhh it pisses me off that i let him treat me this way. What I need to do is get him home and then fuck him, then tell him to fuck off and i wasnt nothing to do with him. But I know i wont get over him until i have another guy. speaking of that i gotta go cuz kevin is on his way over. I need to go and brush my teeth. *muah* (hopefully)

I know i never want to kill myself, well i never did, i would never have the guts to do that. But I know that some of this shit that goes on in my is there because I let it be there. I hold on to things when I should just let them go. I dont need any fuckin meds. Everyone goes through shit in their life, mine is just a bit worse. But I let things bother me instead of letting them go and doing something about them. Ya I havw no money, so get your ass out there and work.My boyfriend, or whatever he is slept with his ex girlfriend and made me go insane. So fuckin get over him. Ok well that one is going to take some work, but whats meant to be will be. I dont need him to be happy, there are plenty of guys out there who would want to date me ( yet the question is, do I want to date them?) Ha. So I feel fat, wel quit eating junk? But does every problem have a solution? Right now i cant think of one that doesnt. But the solutions arent easy. They take time and they can put you through heartache and pain. But one day, you'll be free.
**** I started praying to St Terese today. this mornig. I recite this prayer and then 5 Our Fathers 5 Hail Marys and 5 Glory Be's all for 5 days. Its kinda weird cuz all I have known is the casual Christian religion so any ""formal"" prayer besides the Lord's Prayer is kinda diffrent for me. But I felt relief today. I actually felt like when things got stressful, I thought about the peacefullness I felt this morning while praying, and I want to pray more. I think this is going to help me, to have something to bow to then to always want things to bow to me. I dont know if its wrong though to mix all these religions, pull apart and use what I want. I guess it doesnt as long as am believing. Well thats all for tonight."

I am sooo emotionally tired its unbelivable. I was looking at the perfect picture of rick and I, for so many moments I felt as if it werent real, like we were over. It was so weird it was scary. Then I had a nightmare that kyla was going to Missouri with us and she was trying to get him back. Ughh I am so sick right now, Like something is taking over my body and it wont let go. I am just thinking of rick and how do i explain what i want when i dont even know? I cant decide to see if I should be patient until he graduates or not, i mean it is so hard to feel this way. Everything is so hard these days and it makes me just want to give up. It feels as though a life as crappy as mine isnt worth living. But then I think of that moment when you are just about to die and you know it. You are scared and not sure why you did this. And probably for that moment you are just normal, you psychoticness is gone, and then you are gone. Then I think of all the people i see everyday, so sick and we know before them that they are going to die. I think that is part of my depression, working around all this negativity. Ya we may be saving lives but we are also watch more people die. So my life isnt that bad, at least not yet. O well i am just wondering what to do, stay here or go to Missouri. I am seriously thinking, but it takes so long. Part of me wants to do it to hurt people, like rick, but if i love him so much then why would i do that? I need to start praying and getting back into my whole religion thing. I think it will help me so much, I am carrying this whole load on me and I dont really need to. I know that He will help me I just need to get on a path with him. I should call Scott G. I really need to think some stuff out, and get my life under control and start living it for me, making sure i am taken care of instead of other people, Life is just sooo confusing, I am confusing."

"event","aHHH What a day. I have no voice whatsoever, NONE. But hey I had fun last night, we didnt get home until 4 am. Ash and I went out with greg donato and all those guys to old town saloon. I had a hella good time, although there was much emtyness there. I miss rick soo much. Anyway, i am getting a new job, i have two options, as leasing agents. I am so excited, I cant wait to leave the hospital. My supervisor told all the guys to leave the comments out, so then on sat I told david wasnt about him cuz hes so awsome, we had a good convo about leaving the hospital. I am so excited to leave its like starting over, a real professional job. Then I sometimes think that I am sooo boring. Really in life i want to be a family type. A mom, a wife, all that. Why dont I have a drive for anything else right now, ya writing but to me i mean i want to be famous or  at least in the community and i just feel really emtiness right now.
I think its all the uncertanty ( i cant fuckin spell) of everything. about myself, my image, body, family, job, rick, religion, my whole freaking mind is sooo sick with confusion. Trying to figure out everyting just sucks, i mean everything seems to take so much effort and I just want to say fuck it all and stay in bed all the time. I need a new crowd. Sometimes i just want to have no responsibilites, run around town all night smoke pot and drink, do drugs and just party, but really i dont want to do that. Really what i want is to be just immune to pain. Anyone could hurt me and i wouldnt care, it wouldnt phase me at all. And what sucks is that life is not like that, Its all about pain, all about this freeway, your going so fast you feel like your on the right track and you can move freely. Then somehow unexpectadly you get him slammed to the wall and you cant move, the pain is so great  you would rather just die, end it all right there, because you know you will never feel as good as your last ride.
I know people care about me, but i dont know if anyone really knows me, because i dont even know myself really, i mean , i am lost inside my own mind.searching for the switch that will put me back to my own happiness. No pills or doctors, just able to wake up everyday and think, i am me, and i am ok. Damn  i feel like a psycho. A lonley person. UGHHHH You know most of this is ricks fault, well not him directly, but what he did to me.And the more I think as the days go by I question whether he is really for me, yet the thought of him  with anyone else makes me sick. I have no idea what i am going to do about that.
Ok then to make me feel better I know what I need to do. I need to start inside and find myself. What am I good at? what do i want out of life, WHO AM I REALLY? Well for starters, I am JENNIFER FUCKING FRANCIS, who the FUCK ARE YOU. I need to be me always. Just show the world who i am and say fuck you get outta my way if someones in the way. OK well thats what i am going to do and now ITS ALL ABOUT ME,"

I am like jealous of all his past relationships, although i am only the 2nd girl hes slept with, AND i dated one of his friends.Why does it bug me so much? Oh maybe cus when we went thru all that shit he went back to his ex kyla and fucked her.""just to get things back to normal but after all i could think about was you"" he says.

I mostly was thinking, so this is what its like to have a mother.felt really good. then i had so many dreams today. one about how i went to costco with Hope ( ricks mom) and we bought a wedding dress for me.I guess I was going to get married after I had my boob job( which in real life i am going to get)its part of my operation barbie doll, where i am going to lose like 30 lbs and become a model, oh ya and move to la. I know it sounds superficial, but hey whatever makes you happy huh. Yesterday Rick went home. Its so weird cuz on everyday that he has to go home I feel like I want to break up with him. I dont know why. I just get so fed up and hurt that he is leaving me that i feel like hurting him. yet then later i miss him and i am glad i didnt.

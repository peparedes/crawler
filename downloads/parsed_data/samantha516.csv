Haha by the way he's pretend...sort of lol he doesn't know that he's my boyfriend. And then silly katie and I saw a boy across the gym and tried to wave to him like the entire time haha.

The dance was fun...I was so tired though. I couldn't wait to get home and my poor feet hurt like a mother. They felt like jell-o when I took off my high heels. Then Sunday I slept in until 10 and then went to Kayleen's house and then her mom, my mom, Kayleen, and I went to Starbuck's then off to Monsters Inc. on Ice. OH yea baby...MONSTERS INC. Sulley Oh Yea!! Then yesterday I was back to school and then today I had volleyball practice. Don't even get me started on that. It just pisses me off now. I don't know though. Life has been going kind of good. Good some days bad others but hey what's new. I don't know my head is still kind of turning and I still don't understand alot of things but I guess I have to get used to that.

"event","HEYA!! Well I went to the coffee house tonight at school! It was fun. And then stayed a little after and decorated for tomorrow's pep assembly. 06 BABY!! We colored with chalk...haha and Kailey and Erryn made a hopscotch. OH YEA! But moving on...I'm starting to get sad. I don't know, I have alot of emotion building up inside me. It sucks and I'm not quite sure what to do with all of it. I mean, actually I don't know what I mean. I think I miss my old life. I'm ready to just be able to start all over again. Weird but I keep thinking of like Oklahoma, I think I almost wish I could go back. I mean I don't have it horrible out here but I'm ready to start over. I miss my old best friend, I miss being happy, I miss just everything. I mean like I have great friends now but I want a best friend that's always there for me and that I can have all these memories with and I do have those but I want my old best friend. And I'm sick of being mad at people. I wish I was better at forgiveness but I think I'm really hurt by some people that I just can't accept it now. I just want to feel better. I wonder if this is just a phase, but I don't know. I'm feeling so emotional yet I can't even cry or anything. It's confusing. Good Night!

"event","Well I think things are really starting to head down a better road. At least so far there getting there. I'm starting to forgive and forget, well not really forget but forgive and that's a big one to do. I can't wait until I'm okay with all this. It's hard and exciting and scary and so much more, all at once. Kind of a brain rush if you ask me. But I think I'm ready for it this time. I'll see what happens though...GOOD NIGHT!!

"event","OMG so yea, I haven't updated in awhile but whatever I'm to lazy to get all in to detail about what's been going on so I'll make it quick. I went to Unitown last week. It was actually alot better then I thought it would be. I met some freaking AWESOME people...heck yea!! And then I came home and it's back to the same old stuff...sorta. So everything I start rambling on about right now may totally be confusing and if you REALLY wanna know then you can ask and I MIGHT tell you. So yea, umm I'm over this one kid now (haha that's so lame considering the whole freaking world probably knows who that is) Well I'm not completely over the kid but to a certain extent I am and hey, it's a little bit of progress and every step counts...right? I don't know. But yea, my old best friend, well we aren't really best friends anymore *tear* but there is away for me to become best friends with them again, I'm just not sure if I'm really up for that though. Because the way it would happen is totally not fair to another person, unless, of course, I have stronger feelings or whatever then I think I have. I don't know though like yea. And then I hung out with one of my buddies yesterday for the first time in a while. It was awesome...We didn't hang out long but it was fun. One of those old memory type things, I was pretty excited. And then freaking today, yea it was an ok day. But of course there was a crappy part and it made me kind of angry and bitter for awhile...so not fun. I'm starting to get stressed again which completely sucks. I think I'm doing pretty crappy in school right now, which isn't good at all considering softball starts in about oh two weeks and I have to have good grades in order to play. I fell pretty far behind for only missing two days. So I'm attempting to clean my stupid room too so that I can just get that out of the way and maybe feel a little better. But onto a lighter note I suppose...My mom and bob are going to go look at puppies this weekend. Yay for teapot yorkies. I so want one....and I want it to be a girl. I'll get it cute little accessories, a pretty diamond collar and a pretty pink leash along with a matching sweater...haha. Sad I know but I'm pretty excited, but who knows if they'll even come home with one. And then I have a volleyball tourney this weekend and after that I gotta get to my winter formal. I need to find out what I'm wearing...uh oh lol gotta look FaNcY. Not really but it's fun getting dressed up. Oh yea and how could I forget, I get to go to Monsters, Inc. on ICE!! HECK YES!! I'm so excited. Haha I feel like a little kid again...oh those were the days. Ok not really but it sounded good. Well I'm going to go take a shower or something.

Omgosh...So I'm so confused (not a bad confused, i don't think) Nikki you know what I'm talking about. Wow I mean what was that? Let's just hope it's not what it sounds like. But yea, moving on. I guess there's some people you will never understand. I mean I used to understand but now, I never know what to expect. This person just confuses me, I mean one day you're happy with me, the next day it's awkward. I don't really know what to expect. I hope that eventually things can turn around, and I'm hoping that happens kind of soon, but I'm not going to get my hopes to high for that. I don't know, like lately things are just so random, I guess that's how to say it. I just wish I knew what was going on in your head, and alot of other peoples heads too. Things would be MUCH easier that way, but that's obviously something that isn't going to happen. I guess all I can do now is see what happens, but I can't just drop everything for that. I have to get over it and whatever happens happens...right?

"event","Today was nothing exciting. I had volleyball practice after school, that was fun, a lot better then I thought it was going to be. And I got my car back today. It's not the nicest or fanciest car that's for sure, but I'm very happy that it at least runs and has AC. It looks kind of crappy right now though because I'm pulling the crappy tinting off of it and its kind of not done, so there's pieces here and there. Tomorrow I'm hanging out with Darsha, it'll be fun. So, I'm so sick of drama. Like seriously it seems like that's what some people thrive off of. Like their day can't be complete without a little drama thrown in and personally I think it's stupid. I mean of course everyone is going to encounter drama in one way or another, its inevitable but you don't have to have it every single day. I mean some of its just stupid and pointless. It all starts with just stupid little remarks, uneccessary ones at that, and then everyone just starts going on and on about nothing. I mean I'm not saying I'm not guilty of it too but it really does getting annoying. And then, certain things have been brought up that really have me thinking. It's kind of hard too, I think I need that other persons input until I will ever have closure with it. Time will tell though. If someone does something that is wrong and they know it, should they regret it? Or live in regret about? And if they correctly handle it afterwards, or as correctly as possible, what happens next? Is it ok then, or semi-ok, or is it still something to regret? I wonder about that sometimes. Because you always hear that you should never regret things, and I completely believe that because why waste time regretting something. No matter how hard you try you can never take it back so why worry regretting it? That's just me though, I don't know what everyone else thinks.

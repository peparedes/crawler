"event","My deepest fear - leaving aside the terrible fear that the future I have seen may come to pass - is that I shall lose my mind.

I can make no complaint against my benign gaolers, who have done everything possible to make my imprisonment as tolerable as possible. They are full of pity and kindness. I have a little garden to tend, plenty of books to read. At first I listened to recordings of the human voice, to keep me company. Before long I could not bear to hear the voices of strangers. Now I live in silence. Sometimes I speak aloud to myself, I cannot help it.

The grief has diminished to an ache, sometimes within my bosom, sometimes in my stomach.

There are times when I hate my husband so badly that I picture myself taking his life.

I only wish

His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!</u>"

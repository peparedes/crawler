"event","Oh my fucking GOD.  I'm not even sure where to start.

So... We all moved down here together to live in this big house.  And we all agreed to bring our parts.  Some of us got rid of everything we owned in order to come here and make a new life and take a crack at something we all believed in.  So when a few of us tried to bring kitchen stuff, Billy said ""No, don't worry about it, I've got that.""  And ""I've got that too!""  

Fast forward to 6 months into our one year lease.  Billy comes to us and makes the announcement that he and his wife are moving out in less than a month with no warning beforehand that anything was less than awesome.  Okay.... What?  You're moving out and sticking us with the last 6 months?  Wow... I don't really know Billy and Michelle very well, but what I do know is that I'd never even do that to someone I hated.  You just don't abandon someone with a lease.  It's SO wrong.  Meanwhile, he's still in the band, and no one says anything to him about the fact that he's screwing the rest of us over.

I have to get a different job, and a second job to attempt to make ends meet, and at this point, my bills have skyrocketed to over $1000 a month more than my income.  Awesome.  I also made a point to gathering all of my kitchen things out of storage when I was in Seattle last month to prepare for Billy and Michelle moving out and leaving us without anything to cook with.

 It's kind of hard living with someone who is screwing over all of their friends, AND being pissy about things like paying their portion of the bills.  So for the past month we've had to deal with Michelle turning the AC off.  We live in fucking Las Vegas.  It's July.  I've had candles melting in the shade in my room.  And if you ask her to leave the AC on for a little bit at night to cool the place off, she flies off the handle.

Moving along, Billy and Michelle finally move out last Friday THANK GOD.  And since I'm now responsible for paying half the bills on our 7 BR home in the suburbs, Jerimiah and I get the master suite that they just moved out of.  I go take a picture of the bathtub that's mine since they left and post it to facebook with a ""OMG YAY!""

The response?  ""GET OUT OF MY ROOM!  I paid for it through the 15!!""   Really?!  You fucking moved out!  We're supposed to leave it empty for a week?  Whaaaat the fuck?  (There was no indication of ANY bad blood at all before the move out announcement.)

So they're gone.  And they took all of their kitchen things.  And all of my kitchen things.  They took the wireless router out of the house.  They took the fucking ice cube trays out of the freezer.  Luckily we won't need to eat any food, or use the internet to get a job, or want any ICE when it's 114 here today.

And Billy is still in the band with the boys.  Which is the whole reason we're living here in this place.  I can't even wrap my mind around WHY on earth we're still here.  If the choice was mine to make, I'd tell Billy and Michelle to have fun with their new lease, break ours (Because we can't afford to live here anymore!) And move back to Seattle.

I took a $6 an hour paycut to move here, and my rent is now double what it was in Seattle.  And instead of 40 guaranteed hours a week and a second part time job, I'm being scheduled 5 days a week and 25 hours at Starbucks.  And the labor laws here are set up that I can't work more than 8 hours in a day.  So if I work 5 at Sbux, I pretty much have no way to pick up hours to try to make 40 without getting a second job.

Las Vegas just passed Detroit for #1 highest unemployment rate in the country.

"event","It's been a while since I've made any serious posts about what's going on in my world.  So I figured I'd give you guys a nice little retro-active fill in for what's been going on with me since this fall!   Life has been interesting.

So, this summer and early fall, I was busy as hell with work and dance and getting back to school.  And I was apprenticing with Hands of Kali, getting ready to jump into the next big step of my dance career.  Everything was so freaking exciting!  Well, I lifted a bunch of boxes at work just before my first performance with the girls from HoK and SPRAINED my freaking back.  I was out of work for almost three weeks, and had to see my chiropractor for a few months three times a week.  And a massage therapist too.  My back was so incredibly messed up.  :(    It kept me from dancing, and it kept me from school and it kept me from work too.

BUT it gave me a lot of time to plot and plan and come up with new ideas for what I want to do with myself.  :)
I spent the whole fall quarter dealing with this issue.

Then Christmas happened, and that was awesome. And my back was finally starting to feel better, and I was thinking about starting to dance again. The night before going back to school/work again, I ended up in the emergency room because of these really scary chest pains.  The first doctor told me it was my heart, and referred me to a Cardiologist.  So I got to spend a whole week freaking out thinking I was having heart trouble.  The Cardiologist told me the guy was wrong.  But that left me still having chest pains, short of breath and sick as hell.  So I finally got a General Practitioner, and after tons of blood work and testing, I started to get better on my own, and we decided it may have just been a really nasty cold.  January was eaten up almost entirely with all of that drama.

So along comes February!  I'm feeling in tip top shape, my back is strong, my heart is strong, and I've had months to really figure out what I want to do with myself.  So, I'm flinging myself back at dancing in a big big way.  I want to learn everything I can learn, and I want to improve in all the things that I feel weak in.  I'm determined to be the best dancer I can be.  So, I'm back to performing again!

This week, I have two performances scheduled on Wednesday.

The first one is at Amore in Belltown at 7PM.

The second one is at the Noc Noc, at 11pm.

You should come see me dance, I'd really love to see you out!  :)"

In front of QFC we ran into this homeless guy who was asking for money and obviously freezing cold.  I told him I didn't have any money, but I did have a blanket in my car that he could have.  So Mike and I and the homeless guy walked back to my car and I gave him this old pink down comforter that I was going to take to the goodwill.

I ended up sailing on the Tuna with Dave, Christian and their friend Kurt.  The weather was ABSOLUTELY perfect, nice and warm when we started out, with a nice breeze.  We kicked ass.  Started with the third start class, and by the first mark caught up with half of the second start folks.  They had a five minute head start on us.  Needless to say, we left the rest of our class pretty far behind, and won a golden duck.  Then did a victory lap.  

Back at the houseboat we got to watch an amazing sunset, watch the spiders come out, and the moon come up over Queen Anne.  Dare I say I miss it in Houseboatland?   I had such a great night.

"event","So, in the world of bellydance, I've been working my tail off coming up with an awesome new routine.  I have a performance coming up on the 25th at Harem on the North end of Broadway. (Across from the Deluxe.)  If you can, you should stop by, I'd love to see you there!  It's at 7PM.

I also got some more pictures back from the shoot with Machine, including some of my bellydancy ones. :)

Part of this new position means that I'll be helping out a lot with some of the internet stuff for them.  So, if you're reading this, add <lj user=""handsofkali""> because I'll be posting there every now and again as well.

Also, I started a Hands of Kali group on Facebook, so you should find me and join that!  :)

"event","I splurged yesterday and had my tarot read, which was an interesting experience for me, because I've never had it done before.  What I learned from it is nothing I didn't already know, but it felt good to hear it from someone who isn't very close to my situation right now.  She told me that I need to embody the Queen of Wands going forward.  And if I don't know what that means, that I should go home and do research.  So after doing research, I found out that the Queen of Wands is who I am, when I'm not dealing with this funk I've been in since last fall.

So moving forward I will strive every day to be the Queen of Wands.  I will embrace the positive in my life, because I am very lucky to be surrounded with the people I have near me.  And I will project the love that I have to everyone I come in contact with, and will act to empower myself and better myself.  And I will strive to use this time of upheaval to come through it better than I was before.

She also offered some interesting insight regarding whatever is going on with Shawn.  She said that he was being genuine with me these past months, and that he's dealing with something that he's having a rough time with.  She said that I'm probably safer away from him right now.  And that at some point in the future I will gain closure and that things will be much smoother for me once I make it through this period of strangeness.

She told me to be patient.  And I can tell you patience isn't my strong suit, especially when it comes to not knowing what the hell is going on.  But I will be patient, and steadfast in my love for the world.  I just wish I could be there to help deal with this issue."

"event","I've spent this week trying to convince myself that I was angry and not hurt.  There's much more pride in being angry than there is in being in pain, I told myself.  But being angry doesn't do anything for anybody, and not allowing myself to fully grieve does nothing but draw this out.   So I'm getting this off my chest for all the world to read:

I'm not angry.  I'm hurt.  I love Shawn.  And I miss his friendship a lot.  But it's not fair to try to be angry at him for not feeling the same way, and in the end, the only person it really ends up hurting is myself.  It takes a lot more effort to project anger than it does to be honest with myself and everyone around me.  

So world... I'm not angry with you.  I love you.   And because I love you, I forgive you."

Taking two classes this spring.  Both of them are 200 level classes, one is Biology and the other is Anatomy and Physiology.  The ANP class is MW 6:00P to 9:30P and the freaking Biology class is Saturdays from 8AM to 2PM.  EW!  But they're my favorite subjects.  Wish me luck!"

Friday night I saw Cloverfield at Cinerama. It was really good, but also one of the most stressful movies I've ever seen.  But definitely worth seeing. 

Saturday night I went and saw I Am Legend.  It was entertaining, and it was a great venue to see it.

And then Sunday my friend Bastian came into town.  Which is awesome because I haven't seen him for a bazillion years.  Or something like that.  :)  It was very nice to see him again.

Today I'm hanging out with Dina and enjoying the sunshine. :)  Woot."

"event","i hate writing in this goddamn thing. lets see. long weekend. got off of school, got off of work. my dad and joy got married. brian took pics. i took my car back to its home in canada. i hate fucking canada.

thats the short version if you want alot more, scroll on down



the night before the weddinf i picked up brian we went back to my place we we proceded to mock him and stuff ribs and liquor down his throat. brian loves him some smirnoff ice. he also had never had ribs before, whats wrong with that boy.
the next day we got up at like 6 and started to get ready, mind you we went to bed at 3. my dad changed the plans once again. had to get ahold of brian and tell him i had to pick him up earlier. and of course he was online downloading porn... again. sicko. i never do that...
got back here all dressed up brian was supposed to just take pictures at random, he kinda just shot like three. it was kinda funny having hime cause he doesnt seem used to setting up shots or working with people he jsut takes a pic and walks away. meanwhile were all like... how was it? are we done?
limo dude was funnier then shit, we were puttin in music and he was up in the front singing along, he was weird. couldnt drive for shit either, we were sliding everywhere so finally got to the court and it was closed cause of the holiday weekend, im like fucking judge. he better get his ass out here, i practicly pay his salary with my parking tickets, speeding tickets, and other court related bullshit. he was there and the cermony. got to the part with the rings, i was the best man so i was supposed to hand them to my dad. but AJ was the ringboy and when the part was coming up im like aj, give me the rings, he gets it out of his pocket and then stops and goes no. im like aj what the hell are you doing, give me the damn ring. no. i will kill you give me the ring and i snatched it from him. then judge is like if you dont want this couple to be together speak now. and im like brian shut up. he was talking the whole damn ceremony, somebody had to do it.
got back in the limo and crusied around a bit, went to the falls, took pictures. went to tim hortons for some food. and this old guy fucking cuts in fronbt of me and goes, large coffee. the woman looks at him and looks at me, im like yea this a long order, i want... then he goes, large coffee. ladies like dude you werent next, hes like yea i was. im like really cause i dont think you were. this little fucking old guy starts trying to give me sass. im like quit jibba jabbering old man. then my dad comes back from the bathroom and goes just let him go.
fucker.
so then we dropped of brian and went for a little more cruising.then went home packed up and headed for the border. fuck was it a long line. my dad was in one car and me and lindsy were in mine. it was a friday and a holiday weekend. huge fucking line. took forever. i got sunburn from sitting there. this one guys radiator blew up, grew liquid and steam everywhere, it was great. i took pictures.
we beat my dad across so we went to the hotel to register. i hate fucking canadians and tourists, stupidest fucking people. i was so pissed off i started playin chicken with them. finally got around to the hotel. it was the wrong fucking one. they sent us up the falls to another one. and of course we got lost. finally got there. they ade us pay for parking. then they dicked us out of our $75 voacher for food. the kiddie room was pretty cool big beds for me and lindsy and a floor for the lesser beings aj and kaly. my dad and joys was real cool, and big. they decided to hit the pool and me and lindsy were like fuck dat shit. we still need sleep. so we slept and they swam around in some filth water.
then i think we went out for dinner but me and lindsy were still bombed from the lack of sleep, and my dad was just plain bombed. he was having a good day. we went to the outback cause we were tired of trying to deal with that shit hotel. and we all had like two bites and either got full or feel asleep. so we went back to the rooms and slept.
Kaly tried to make a tent under the desk in the room and sleep under that. dont know who she ever saw do that...(me) so in the middle of the night i wake up to he like screaming out. apparently she woke and forgot she was under a sheet and freaked out, so crawled acrss my bed and tore the sheet down. then shes like... what the? im like just go back to bed, i rolled over. then she woke up again with bad dreams. so i woke her up again. then i think she woke up and said there was a guy in the room staring at everyone. i slept through that, but i think i was awake enough to swear at her. whenever im in that in between stage from sleep to awake im very violent.
next day we got up and ate at the buffet and went to clifton hill, went through some funhouse and the went to midway arcade. i kicked some ass and defended my title in the shooting game, also i did that tilting game and got the ball in the hole thanks to a tip from jp. thanks j-fizzle where ever you are...
then we went home, lindsy took my car and kaly to the mall and me and aj hung out for a bit at home and ordered food. then we went to see hellboy. this chick at the theatre was trying to pick me up, i pratically laughed in her face. she was like"" do you know this chick?"" no. "" do you know this one then?"" no. ""i feel like i know you"" you dont."" thats weird"" not really. 
such a lame attempt, and too young too. too bad, im getting lonely...
so yea then today we got up early again to get ready to go to joys grandmas. and we went there. not much else. we ate and talk to some relatives for a bit. then we tried to go to my moms, but she didnt come home yet,so we hungout for a bit and then decided to leave anyways. oh took back the smith mobile.

thats about it. for somebody who hates to type that was a shit load. and im still bored. god damnit when will everybody get back. also happy easter to all. smith you should come up man, theres still time...depending on when you read this.

and finally everybody say congradulations dad and joy..."

so yesterday was fun went to school, found alex, came home- hungout, took alex back to school for her schedule, hung out with jp in the parking lot, picked hanes back up, went to jps and hungout and ate, then i took alex home when jp went to work. on the way back i figure, ""why not a changeof pace"" so i took of in the other direction. it was wet and i was speeding and misjudged the turn, long story short. i paniced stomped my brakes and slid through a little mud and rain on the road into the curb. 

fun. 

the front right wheel is lodged up under my car, all the mounting bars are bent and warped and the mechanic says im lucky if i didnt bend the frame too. the guys at the garage cant even look at the car till tommorow. but it looks like at least another 500 dollars i dont have.

now i have to call brad smiths mom and see if i can borrow brads old car for like a week till mine gets better. i havent talked to for so long and i dont to call up and be like, ""hey, hows it going? remeber your sons old car? well you know he doenst use it? well you know how bad a driver i am? can i steal his car?"" thats just lame. i think thats the only chance i have though, i still have school.

if this had happened a week later, itd be no problem at all. i can walk to work and back now im gonna have to bum rides or steal a car. fuck. i suck. 

so heres the total money tally. ive got 197 in my checkin, 250 in my savings. 500 due for insurance. so that wipes that out, and a bill for 173 for my capacitor. now pile another 500 dollar bill on top of that. what im am i? in deep shit. 

my dad was pretty cool about the whole thing. very fucking cool. weirdly cool. like im afraid im gonna get beat to death in my sleep cause hes acting so cool now. my dad threatens everyone, brian, jp, alex and especially myslef but when i need him hes always there. 

like last night i was waiting for the tow truck and alex walked up to keep me company. then my dad pulled up and was like "" what the fuck are you doing? you cnat pay for this."" then he invited alex back to my house and him her and i ate dinner and talked about stupid shit we've done and picked on me all night. that was actually good times.

oh yea, i called my grammy in the car to see how she is, and when she asked me what was new i told her about me and alex. then i put her on the phone with alex cause she was sittig next to me. grammys like well make sure he takes good care of you, and then proceded to threaten her to be good to me. im her favorite. 

so to recap im another large amount of money in debt. im an idiot. and alexc has been threatend by me, my dad, kaly, and my grandmother. long night."

and for all of you who want to know:
this light pisses me off so bad ive spent time getting the timing down and have found that it is actually impossible to get the green legally. coming from either direction the lights before you keep you from getting a green if you go 30 or 35. there for this must be done at 45 and probably when no cops are around. the only way you can get the green is coming from my house toward ward road. timing is important so it probably wont work everytime. when you see a yellow light at the intersection ahead, take the first entrance to the plaza parking lot, drive straight past the second and out the third the light will stay green just long enough for you to get through. i actually made a handy picture to show you but i cant figure out how to get it in here, it was made in paint and its pretty.

also on the way back from dropping hanes back at home i had to go through the satan light. i got the damn car up to 55 and still got a damn red light"

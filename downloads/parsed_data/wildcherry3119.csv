"event","So i started at Mt. Union on August 28th. It is amazing here! I took my 1st final today... i am almost done with my 1st semester of college. I didnt ever think that i could get here. But still i cant help but think, is college right for me. I see how much my friends here want to be college graduates, but i just cant help to think that i dont want it as badly as them. I know this is strange but i really want to get my cosmotology license. I love doing hair, and i think i could make a solid career at it. I have no clue what i am doing with my life, i am just going along for the ride. I love my new friends most of the time, my roomie is moving out, but i dont really care. She and i dont always get along because we are really different. My best friend here is amazing, her name is Indigo. My other pretty good friend here is beth, but she can be a bitch. I have made tons of other friends here but there are to many to mention. My love life is really dull right now, its really hard to meet a lot of guys when ur close friends dont like to go out, and u live in an all girls dorm. I have started meeting a lot of people in my classes. I keep reminising with my old loves, and i wonder what if something was different, i still think i could be in love, but i don't even know if he knows that i felt like that. Things are different between us now, we live so many miles apart, and he is different now, and then again so am i. I wish life was easier but it's life, its not supposed to be easy, thats why it is so worth while. Well this is enough of an update for awhile, maybe i will again in 6 months or maybe a few day, lets see how the wind blows.
Good night, sleep tight, good luck on finals!"

Today i did nothing for the 1st time all summer i spent an entire day at home... in some ways it was nice because i didnt take a shower worry about making plans washing clothes to go out ... it was great. Tomorrow i havent made plans yet either but maybe i will atleast go out 2morrow. Last night was pretty fun but very scary. We all went up to Quaker but we ended up going to Tully's instead. THERE WINGS R HUGE and YUMMY! Anyways it started raining and i wasnt gonna wait for everyone else so i told justin that we were justin going 2 tullys and dan was pissed but o well.

"event","I have the worst head-ache right now i am about 2 kill myself.i just got back from justins suprise b-day party it was so fun! I freaking love justin i am so happy he and jeff r 2gether. He was so suprised when we all jumped out and he just stood there shocked. AFter me and Jen Pancake got in the pool and we all swam around for like 2 hours , now i am so freaking tired. Saturday was like the best night. Steph had her graduation party and when i got there we played volleyball my team won SWEET! After me and steph got bacardi raz out of her fridge and i drank it and we got another one which i held onto for awhile before i drank it. After me and chelsea went on a walk up the street which was interesting, we tried to play with a baby rabbit but it kept running off. Next we went back and steph was starting 2 get really drunk and since i didnt want her drinking alone we got the jello shots out and kept drinking. Then Jen and Fuzzy (code name) got there and we played beer pong and me and steph got into a cake fight (which was freaking hilarious because we were both so drunk!) and i had cake plastered in my hair. Next i drank about 5 smernoffs and we went swimming. Steph has like a pool bouncy thingy i dunno but its fun when u drunk. We swam around and i kept screaming about a certain person i ""love"" while jeff kept trying 2 get me naked lmao! After steph started getting sick so i went and got a beer and rubbed her back for awhile. Next steph puked and we walked her inside 2 get her cleaned up and let her go 2 sleep for awhile. So then me fuzzy jen jeff and christine went back 2 the pool and i told christine about why i am pathetic... I never realized how much you can ""love"" someone u didnt think u had any feelings for origanally and actually i really wouldnt call it love (yes i realized this while i was drunk 2) i have a physical attraction 2 this person... anyways christine told me if i was a lesbian i could be her lesbian lover and i laughed for like a freaking hour. Next steph was so sick i decided i wanted 2 go home but i couldnt drive because i was fucked up so we said good bye to sick steph and jen drove me 2 the end of my steet and fuzzy picked her up and they followed me 2 my house and turned around. As soon as i walked in that house i straightened up so fast it was crazy! After i went 2 bed and i wasnt even hung over on sunday which was nice. Anyways... school seems to be rolling up on us pretty quickly which i am really not looking forward to but hey only 1 more year.

After we rode the subway back to time square and at some dessert and cooled off... next we went to find the broadway store and then off to see WICKED!!!! IT WAS SO FREAKING SWEET!!!!!! i loved it !!! After we ate a hot dog and some pizza yummy. The next morning we shopped some more and went to NBC to get a tour which was actually really awesome!

Mr. Ciminero is a FREAK! went and got my hair done and got ready for prom. After i got ready we went to Angies and then to Amandas for pictures lots of fun. We got to cimineros and had no clue what was going on for about an hour. Food was shitty so was the music yay prom committee! Prom was kinda fun but it was hot and kind of annoying i am so glad its over... what a waste of money. Sunday i had 2 work which is always fun no one was there so we just fucked around all day. Jeff scared me and i fell on the floor... then he scared me again when we were doing theater checks and i screamed in the middle of a theater that people were in! what a butthead haha. After i went to my voice lesson for like 50 million hours the damn phone kept ringing. Today i have to sing at a church for mrs. shuwers so i had 2 get dressed up... which means i look like an idiot. o well mandy and erica are at camp fitch and  wolfies not here yet what a boring day..."

"event","Today i thought a lot about the things that have happened to my junior class this year... yes we lost jenn... yes there was a major homecoming battle... yes we fought with cullibitch and everyone else... yes there was another fight... cant we get over it... why do we have to hold grudges for so long... today i realized that a grudge is the worst thing, what if something really terrible happens 2 the person we r mad at wont we feel terrible and what if there was no tomorrow to tell them we r sorry... yes i know this sounds corny and i probably sound like the biggest idiot around but during the last few weeks i have taken a step back and looked at myself from every perspective here is a list of the things i have found out...

Im a bitch
I am a terrible friend
i talk about people way to much
that i get mad over the stupidest things
i have 2 have my way (only child syndrom)
i hold onto things way to long


this makes me ugly on the inside and out... i feel so guilty everyday because i know that about 25% of everything thats happened is my fault and yes i am sorry to everyone but people make mistakes they learn we move on and thats the way the world works. Cant we act like civilized individuals and just not have this looming black cloud of hate always over our heads. Its our junior year next year we will be gone from this hell hole known as lordstown and maybe we will never see each other again. We have no chance to do this over again this is life right now u cant make this up again there are no second chances.....

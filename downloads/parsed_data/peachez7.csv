"event","I think its really funny how in an instant everything can change. We are so close to having a 3rd world war and no one knows it. We can be dead in a matter of minuets. There are nuclear weapons that can destroy us in an instant. It is quoted from alber enistein although not exact along the lines of "" i do not know what weapons will be used for the 3rd world war,...but by the 4th..they will be using sticks and stones.""  makes you think? it sure has hell made me think. Everything can change in an instant..no second thought just gone. I realized this walking home. How quickly my life can change by one event. For instance I could be hit by a car walking home because we have no distinct sidewalks. I could die, or be paralized or it could just be life changing. But it doesnt matter beucase everything changed. Medical bills would go through the roof and the greif that overwhealmed my family and friends would effect them. Scarry to think about... To know that in an instant in 10 seconds your life could change forever. We have so many things we take for granted and we dont even realize it. Studying the World War and the Industrial Revolution for example showed how women lived in the 19th century. Poor lives, worked for less than minimum wage and couldn't go to school and didn't get paid the same amount as a man did for the same job. And working at home..they would get paid half of what the woman was making working at the factory. Maybe someone will take a look over their life and ask themselves if they really like whats happening. Maybe yes and maybe no..I looked at my life this summer before I knew this and I changed many things. For example my need for a guy. I finished so many things this summer and im happier with the way that i am. Well just take at look at yourself and whats around you.. Do you really like it? Do you really want to live this way?"

I want to get good and to be sponsored and maybe even be signed... I want it so bad. Im willing to do anything just to be able to get good at least and be able to do flips and stuff. I'm not that good right now but I really wanna be. I've never wanted something this badly. I got all excited about it over dinner tonight.My plan was to get good, be sponsored, enter competitions, win them, be signed. Everyone who knows me knows that im not one to be all excited about sports and actually wanna do it. Basketball turned out to be a strictly fun game with friends. But Wakeboarding...I want it to be so much more. So I guess im getting lessons this winter maybe. Im willing to go out and buy a wet suit if i need it and a new board if i really have to. I want this so bad...

Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss


She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night.

Chorus: 
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her 'til I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby.


La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la.

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la.


The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind,
Until the night.

Chorus:
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby.

"event","Woohoo so much happned since the last time i posted haha. Friday sormeh came over like at 12ish and than we just chilled the entire night was greatness. We talked w/ C and D and Joe haha. and than stupid ppl who i hate haha. we finally got offline at 1ish i think. we woke up at 8 and had waffles and than we got ready. we went to six flags and omg it was great. we got in line for X and than just sat there and talked. Got a call from Jeff saying he was almost there and we were like noooooo go away and than he went on some rides by himself and just chilled till we got off the ride. lol. than we met up w/ jeff and just chilled the entire day untill like 7ish. and he wanted to leave hmmm i wonder why haha.so much more on that subject. *pics to come*. than sormeh called D and was like "" where r u guys?! still at ur car??"" and they were like nooooo at Revolution. and so we waited for them there and just sat there than Danny called and we were like ok well meet up w/u to say hey. so than we ran across the entire park from Revolution to Cyclone. wow fast walk there. than we said hey to danny and talked for like 10 min. than went back for D, Joe, Jeff *diffrent one*, Dylan, and some other guy. and we were like where are they! and than we called them and they were like "" were in line for Viper. so we went over and than waited for them at the exit. lol. and than joe called and was lie "" DONT MOVE I SEE U "" haha crazy stuff. so than sormeh and i were like ugh 40 min for a ride nut uh. so we used our fast passes and we were like hmmm they arent there and we got a call going "" whered u guys go??"" and we had passed em. so we went back. and we wer gonna go on Riddlers but the line was to long 2hrs 30min wait. and they were only running one car so yea. so we went on Goliath w/ D and Joe haha. was soo funny. lol. and than we walked around for a bit and said bye and chatted w/ em again. I got a hug off D, claiming it was C's hug, and than we chatted some more and than they actually left for that time. and than i got another hug off D and than Joe gave me a hug too. but keep in mind these guys were for sormeh. and sormeh got hugs too! lol. and than D was like hey jeff this is Brennens cousin. and sormeh and i were like what diffrence doesit make?? crazy stuff. so sormeh and i chilled at her house and stayed up till 3 and we went to sleep slept for 10hrs and woke up at 1pm. it was crazy. we were suppose to hang out till Monday but yea...my mom was like nooooo. so much for those plans

Everything for six flags went wrong....well diffrent than what we planned. Jed turned into Jeff. B and Joe turned into D, Joe, Dylan, Jeff and other guy haha. oh well we still had fun at six flags. i love sormeh so much! lol im still sore and tired from walkin that much. we didnt even go on all the rides haha. but thats cool. sormeh got me wanting to say chill all the time. but yea than id be jocking her. but in the words of sormeh,joe,b,d, and whoever else. it was chill haha. love you lots"

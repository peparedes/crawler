I have been a wondering observer in LJ for too long.&nbsp; I was going to change that. but never did. &nbsp;this time I&nbsp; will&nbsp;
I bring this up because I am right this very moment in los angles ca&nbsp; yes folks la la land .&nbsp; do they still call it that ?&nbsp; I think so. I went to venice beach, santa monica and toke pic and just looked around today I go to the getty center, and tomorrow I drive sunset blvd form one end to the other."

"event","last night was one of the best nights I Have had in a very long time 
I went to a slam poetry reading, with a few people I knew which made it very good 
even if I think I talked way too much, but cyn fiance was cool and let me ramble for a bit 
I don't know much about the slam poetry community I have met only a few of the players. but I was really glad I went out last night. I met new words that touched me. I loved evey movement on the stage and the feeling of just being apart of something great. 
dave put on a wonderful show."

"event","So I have made a (resolution) is that how you spell that word? to start posting on this site. once a week and not just watch and see what everyone else is doing. even if it just a photo. or a poem. I am going to start paying for the site too. big steps. the first poem I'm going to post is one I wrote a few mouths ago I went to a recital one of the people playing was this girl I know named phoebe,  she plays the violin. I was really moved by her playing and I wrote the this poem. 


I call it phoebe 

Phoebe

Do I have a soul? 
The air bleeds with her voice 
Formed from her instrument that plays her as mush as she plays it 
The cold within takes form as her voice sinks into me 
Reminding me of sad yesterdays 
How is she doing this drawing form me
best forgotten lift buried Under stone and ideal imagining of Never happened picture perfect Sundays 
made slow with mellow song and will cooked meals  
And jokes that made the youngest fall over laughing
Their small bodies shacking and bright eyes following all movement they did not understand content but somehow babies always recognize what laughter is 
find meaning in the sounds that fills them and warm there skin 
I see a feeling flow across my mind and I wish for a child's understanding 
For I see no history or content her voice give me none only the memory of emotion 
I sit letting her voice in, she sends notes to shatter against the wall of ideal that is self 
That is me, this constructs made of pain and joy filled sorrow  
odd angles and short bottomless drops 
As I sit and breathe in the melody 
created by simple notes shaped by string and wood.
for a moment I become myself and I see all that is there hiding behind my open eyes
if only I would let it, I wish I could be changed by that voice,  
Not the tone of my skin 
Or my rude intense eyes that try to see behind all the masks in the room 
While trying to shield my own.
Aided by wild spike shaped humor 
And self deprecating words 
that jump out of my crocked mouth 
No if the music of her voice could change any of me 
I wish it would be memory, 
for I know that I will soon forget its gift 
Because I am always the self I have created 
And part of that is forgetting 
Not even to the voice will I surrender forgetfulness

one of the others 
not a easy thing to forget, but I do, long periods, of time passes  
then there are the moment's 
that arrive and I am sharply reminded  
the clutching of the purses 
for it is believed that we need them no matter there  style 
the quicker walk,
the closing elevator door 
that could't hold just one more person 
sorry kitchen just closed 
or sorry private party tonight
oh them? they were here before  
and the best
I'm sorry but my half brother, sister, third cousin form my mother side, best friend  
decide that he wanted the apartment after all
family i'm sure you understand 
I am one of them 
the other 
who are they ? 
how did I join them ? 
I should not have to ask 
I know 
there are no does to pay 
that comes after you join 
no papers to sign
no board of directors to judge and see if you are just the right kind of person we want to 
join us 
no 
membership in this club is free, we are members at birth 
and no mistakes are made 
for we recognize all member's on site

<LI>this ia a good time in my life i just got my own laptop back and i feel like putting something in the journal. &nbsp;i have decided to put something in every day form today.

<LI>A few nights past, I made my way across the park <BR>a short root to the comfort of my couch and a cup of tea<BR>to drive the day away. midway or some feet past. I saw a interesting sight<BR>a picnic cloth layed out on the grass. on it, a&nbsp; man with a bottle of wine chilled, I noted, in a silver bucket filled with the moon light and ice. beside the wine, a loaf of french bread and white cheese. swiss I believe. cut into neat little squares all in a row on a&nbsp;green triangle plate.<BR>and did i forget to write the man was naked as a new born seal. thow of the white verity <BR>all this you think would cause even me, a man hardened by the city streets a moment pause. so you would think. <BR>but I know it was not so. <BR>a naked man eating cheese, why pause for that. <BR>when midway form my couch and my tea. <BR>no it was. I ask forgiveness for adding this last <BR>but I must note it was the reason for my pause. <BR>staked into the ground <BR>a post and sign.<BR>that read </LI></UL>

"event","hugging fathers 


she had become intimate with the bathroom floor. she had noted, a black spot behind the bowl at the base of the toilet she had almost decided to give it a name. Also there was a penny, it had turned a little green she wondered how long it had been there. she toke a deep breath throw her nose; she did not want to taste her her mouth just then, it tasted of fear. there was a soft intake of breath behind her. she looked up into the warm brown eyes of  Elane her roommate, best friend and lover. they looked at each other.  Elane's face was a mask as she moved into the bathroom and sat beside her on the floor.  It would have been better if she was mad,  anger was better then silence. angry words would be good just Know, those she could fight. but she know that Elane was too smart to fight with her, at least not over this. 
they sat without speaking the smell of her fear coming form the bowl that she had not flushed.
 
finally

"" I thought "" Elane paused 
then still in that voice so low it could not have reached the still open bathroom door 
"" I thought that you and your father were not that close"" 
she did not look at her lover 
"" were not "" she said in her own quiet voice
"" then why does what he thinks matter "" 
"" I don't know "" she turned resting her head on the toilet set 
"" it just does "" 
"" Oh "" there was pain there. 
she could hear the  silent unshed tears in Elane voice, they matched her own. 
the stillness  stretched between them. 
""Do you remember that Tuesday in september"" she asked ELane 
"" yes "" the word was guarded, short; bitten off. 
she turned and looked at her best friend, she  moved over to her placing a had around her shoulder. 
she did not have to say which Tuesday. they both knew. 
it was a cool night,  they had been coming home form a Japanese restaurant, a friend had recommended. Lost in each others laughter and talking about the wonderful food they had just had; there friend had been right. then they  heard it,  a lot of footsteps behind them.  Both looked over there shoulders. Coming toward them was a group of men all caring baseball bats. she remembered the fear that ran throw her, she could feel the same in Elane hands as they began to shake. she looked in to Elane eyes, even in the dark she could see the  fear. Without speaking she let go of Elane hands; trying to pretend that she had not been doing what they had been doing.  She still remembered the look of betrayal in Elane eyes. and the feeling that come from being the cause of that look was like nothing she had ever felt before. almost she wanted the men to kill her, for what she had just done. Elane  had understood, and had forgiven her, someday she would forgive herself.  the men came closer. she remembered thinking she could not run in heels, still she would try. she waited for the words, the harsh cold word and the title that man always used.  The men came out of the shadows and under the street lights.  there bats swinging and there laughter filling the quite night, waring baseball uniforms; talking about the game they had just played. the men did not even look at them. and had not seen them. 
neither women gave a sigh of relief. 
nor did thy talk, or hold hands on the long walk to the car. 
"" this is not that "" she made her voice sound strong and sure.
"" after that night I decided that I would never be ashamed of who I was again. "" 
she looked into Elane face 
"" my father and I are not close, but when we see each other he hugs me 
and it's a real hug. he press me to him like he dosen't what to let go 
and for that moment I am a little girl in her fathers arms, his little girl. and for that moment everything is alright and I'm safe. It dosen't last.
she stopped and for a moment felt her father holding her. 
she almost throw up again. but she fought it, she would have to hold on. 
not just for Herself but for Elane.
 "" me and my father are not close, but still I look forward to that hug"" she pulled Elane to her. and she felt the tears making streaks down her face again. 
"" and tomorrow I till him, and I don't know if he will hug me like that again. "" 
Elane rested her head on her shoulders she did not offer any words of comfort. they would all be lies anyway. she remembered her own moment before her parents. and felt tears coming. it had been 5 years since she hugged her father."

 I'm thinking that you already got a letter form captain forehead. telling you that we are taking on a old big bad. while your shagging the Immortal. Tell him Hi for me and hope he dies a painful death soon. fuck that. I hope he's the one buffy I really do, but I'm going to playing the odds. like say how many times a person can die before they stay dead 
looks like I'm going to beat you. my three to your two. *ha ha ha* what a pair we make. counting how many times you pass into the great,and not so I hope; bight beyond. am I looking to come back form this one. I really don't know. and apart of me doesn't care. I have been here too long buffy. I am young for a vamp 127 yet I have done and seen things vamps 3 times my age haven't and I'm getting a little tired. no make that a lot bloody tired. tired of trying,tired of caring and tired of losing people I care about. we fight and we fight and on and on. and in the end. what?. But I'm not telling you anything that you don't know. better then me, this is a chose for me; some what.   it never was for you. and apart of me was always sad abut that.   But only a small part. the other part, was happy.   The universe chose you and for a moment you chose me. and that made all the difference in the world. 
 I take that back. the first time I died I didn't have a chose I didn't even see it coming. but it was still for her that I died. The next time in the hell mouth that was for you.  but this time. this time, it's for me. I have always wanted to make you proud of me.  I needed your praise and a pat of the head. Good doggy lits have a shag for a reward. but I don't need that now. and it's because of you  that I don't need it.  so..... think you. 

                        summer 

              in winter gold fads to tarnish
              the world sleeps lost in dreams 
              every changing landscape 
              all the colors of ice 

              
              I born of wild winters kiss
              this be my domain 
              and the place of my heart 
              put into the night filled with frost 
              that  bites and slashes 
              the white pain mistaken for love

              how was a heart to know 
              never haven drunken love before
              how was it to know 
              that the pain that clawed and pulled 
              that stopped it. was not love
 
              sleep trees of winter
              the gold comes back
              the cold winds fad 
              the darkness slips sooner 
              under the sunrise 
              
              beauty frozen 
              what did beauty dream as she slept
              waked be a kiss. 
              so was I waken by your beauty
              and your kiss

              winter was my domain
              and ice my love  
              and I dreamed in embracing grays 
              sharp and many tooth black  
              and ever moving white 

              never did I dream of summer

"event","Dear buffy. 
             I no longer love you. but I want you to know that your love was the best thing that ever happened to me.     It made me human again. 
              I signed away the only chance of being a mortal man today. 
Ask Giles abut the shawanshoe prophecies.   I did it because it had to be done. 
But I was not giving anything up.   I could no longer become mortal, but that did not matter; because, I was already human.      Being human is not a thing of flesh and blood.     It is not even a thing of the soul. There are plenty of people that have souls that do things that only Angeles would do. And a few, he only thought of doing. It is not even love that makes a person human. it's a big part of it, but not all. What you gave me was a reason to care. about something. about anything. to just give a dame. I want think you.  We had a day once, you don't remember it. For one day I was a mortal. it was after thanksgiving. and you came to tell me how upset you were that I came to sunnydale without telling you. The day you remember did not go the way you think, the first time around I did not kill the demon.  It got away and I chased him and he cut me I cut him, * that happens when you play with swords. * some of his blood got into my cut and it healed me, making me human. I walked beneath the sun, kissed you on the beach. and learned all contours of your body. and finally discovered what you smelled like in daylight. But it could not last. we are who we are. and for us, there just are no happy everafter's. we make it possible for others to have there happy everafter. and I don't mind that. I sometimes wish that we could have been someone else, but then; if we had been someone else, would we have loved as deeply as we did, would we have risked as much; dreamed as big. I Don't know. But I think no. we were who we were. And even if it was't  forever. I know we lived a life time. and that is all a person can ask, any-person. any-being. 
Buffy
by the time you read this, I will be dead. 
think you for making me human
I am sending you a list names and locations
they are the top players in the demon world, they are called the  the Circle of the Black Thorn. and they are behind everything and I mean everything watch them and stop them when you can. 

I will miss you. we will meet again, in the next life. 

p.s stop in on my son conner his address is below."

"event","a friend {lexalot}, posted the other day about the movie passion of christ by mel Gibson and all the controvesy that is going on abut the movie. 
I just saw apart of the movie on ebert and rouper. and I think I now what the real controversy is about. 
this movie makes the event real 
it is a dirty movie, felled with real pain and real suffering. and that is part of the problem. Mel is taking away the myth of the event and bringing it in the real world. I think a lot of people are not going to like this. the myth of what happened has become more real then the event itself. the myth of what is the driving force. 
making it real. 
takes away form the myth 
it is taking some control away form the people that believe 
that they control the myth. 
the cross is a myth. 
the pain is abstract. 
it happened a long time ago 
the myth says it happened 
it says there was pain
and death
but we do not see it
in this movie we will
and were some people should embrace this they fear it. 
it is the nature of people to create myth
I am buddhist. 
there was nothing spectacular about the death of the buddha. 
yet the myth of his death 
and the events have grown. 
I sometimes wounder if any of the priests remember the real event itself."

"event","I use to write. I say, used to; because I have not done it for a long time. so I'm going to put some things here 
I need to see them again. 

   WINTER FLOWER.  

Across a open field 
walking into the wind 
eyes skyward searching for a absent sun 
in the vaults of my mind
I cried against winter cruelty
lost in my seeming misery
I did not see
I did not know 
that some flowers grow in winter  


   MY PATH

At the must Unexpected place 
in the must unexpected time 
I found it 
the ideal 
the promise  and the possibly
Freedom
and with this discovery, I became free
my path became clear 
I composed a list 
marking the path I would take
and the choices I would make 

I choose not to live with hate
because other's can't live without it 

I choose not to believe what others believe 
just because they always have 

I choose not to listen to those that would 
have me live without hope 

I choose not to judge the many 
buy the actions of the one 

I choose not to forget the past 
because I have no wish to repeat it 

I choose not to walk away
but stand and make a difference 

between breath, between seconds 
I discovered a simple truth 
about a simple Ideal 
freedom 
in all it's form's 
the greatest is found 
not in the many things 
that we choose to do 
but in the many things 
that we choose 
not to do.  


    IF 


If you could, would you have 
said just the one kind word 

IF you could, would you have 
waited just one more minute

If you could would you have 
asked the question

If you could would you have
listened to the unspoken words 

IF you could , would you have 
tried again, 
then again 
then again, then one just one 
more time"

there is something; about words. 
they place images and meaning

they fell the mind with many possibilities

"event","It was not the sound of gunfire that woke me.    It was not the screaming. 
you get use to all that down here. 
It was the sound of no traffic, the quite of the night.   the stopping of cars. 
I woke and looked at the clock on the night stand beside my bed.
it was only Two in the morning.   
There should still be the sound of cars driving by. 
 I rolled over and listened awhile longer; but there was nothing.  
 It was none of my business,   The gunfire;         It just meant one or more drug dealer was dead.    I was not going to lose any of my sleep about that.   Fuck them.   I layed there and listened.  
 No traffic. 
I thought of getting up a going to the window and looking to see what was happening, shit.    Looking would mean I might see what the hell was going on,    also mean I might be seen looking  
might see something that would just fuck up my life.  Or worse. 
Don't need that shit.   I got a life and I don't need any grief in it right now.     Don't need to see someone else shit 
I got shit of my own to deal with. 
Fuck. 
the street was still quite.   Fuck I had to get some sleep. 
I had a big fucking day tomorrow,   the welfare check was late, motherfucking government always trying to fuck with a guy,   talking abut me not looking for a job.   Like the motherfucking suits are going to hire my black ass. shit,     
I was not going to work no gas station like those foreign motherfucking packies jumping every time some rich fucker came in with a big ass grin on my face like I care.     Fuck that.      Fuck them. 
NO I want  a real job.   They ow me,   shit.    Fuck.   
I listen for a moment agian,   very still,      there was the sound of people moving,     lots of people.    I looked at the window 
but didn't move toward it.   Fuck.   Fuck.   Fuck.     Shit.   
Those motherfucker were going to keep me up all night and I need my motherfucking sleep.     I had things to do in the morning.  
Slowly I ran throw the list in my head.  There was that deal going done with Tony.   He had gotten his hands on somethings that he had said where going to make us a lot of money,     quik cash,    easy money.   All we had to do was find the right buyer
 and we would be rolling in it. 
T-bone was good at that, he could find a deal anywhere.  
He often cut me in.  He was a good friend,  and I understand about that last time.   Maybe thinks had not worked out the way they were suppose to.   That was't his fault.   And the time before that was the cops fault   if they had just lift us to do businesses, every thing would be alright.   But they just had to be getting there faces in every thing.  Shit.   God, I HATE BLACK COPS!.   Nothing but sellouts, that's what they are motherfucking sellouts.   They always have to go after a brother just to prove they white enough to be cops.   Don't get it. 
Why the fuck a brother would want to be a cop.   That was just giving in letting them think that there laws mean something to us.    And it don't.   That shit is white shit,  it have nothing to do with me. 
only thing almost as bad is a black lawyer.  Shit.   Coming down here and telling me how I have to step up and take responsibility.   
Shit.   That bitch Ange  here talking like that kid growing in her was mine. Shit, evey one know that she give it up to me she give it up to someone else. Who's to say. Fuck. Let them take care of it, fuck just get rid of the thing.  She talking like she going to keep it and she wants me to help and she talking to a social working lawyer. 
A black man,   Shit,   an't that something;   a black social worker. you would think that he would understand.   She play she pay  
not my problem,   shit.   No that uncle tom has to come down here and tell me that I have to step up and be a man.   Fuck him.   I show him what kind of man I am,  when I kick his black oreo ass. That was what I was going to do, motherfucking sellout.   Telling me what to do. 
This is a free country.    The footsteps got louder, 
I recognized the way the men were walking; form t.v, it was marching. who the fuck would be marching down here.   I looked at the window again,   I had to look.    I creeped to the window, staying low
so the light from outside would not catch me.   I moved to the side of the window,   and waited a minuet;    before opening the certain. Slowly I looked out,   the street was felled with people.  They were dressed in white,  they sort of looked like stormtroopers 
form star-wars.   I began to think they were making a movie.   Then The breath that I  had been holding turn to ice in my stomach,  it was not. Form my window I could see them.    There was little jojo; who started dealing when he was 12,     there was that mulatto hooker Marcy something,    she sometime gave it up for a dime bag.  or a 20.   there was T-bone.   Form here I could see the blood on his shirt, 
his good one;   that's how I know, he would not have let them ruin that shirt.    His mother give it to him, a week before she got capped by one of the rival gangs that thought he was home,  so did a drive by.    Form the window I could see them. I shook; it started in my hands and crawled into my body, the ice grow and I know. I could see them form my window, and one of them looked up.   Even form here I know.   
 He was going to come for me.  
 I know,   it was no longer a free country."

"event","I was reading the sandman today at the bookstore it was the graphic novel brief lives were dream and delirium go looking for there brother distraction. 
in one part of the story a little girl asks weather or not she is remembering in her dream how to fly and forgetting when she wakes or she is just dreaming how to fly. dream tell her that she is remembering how to fly. that got me to  thinking 
if that was a true thing.
that we remember in are dreams the things we once could do. I would like that to be the truth that we could at one point fly. or we are dreaming of something that one day we would be able to do. we are dreaming the possibility of flit.
so i gave it some thought on ways to get wings again. 

7. go looking for tinker bell 
6. find the sandals of hermes 
5. learn to do magic and make a potion 
4. finding a feather from a angle 
3. the hidden glade of the winged horses
2. the ring of the monkey king 
1. dream while standing. 

strange there are more ways to fly but I can't think of them right now. I will give it soem more thought"

"event","when we look at them there is a need to walk among them, there is a need to think that me can conquer them but reaching the peak. 
the peak is the reason that we go to them. the peak is why we think that we can beat them. if we reach the peak if we get past if we stand on it we will be conquers. there is a feeling that mountains can be conquered. in this we would be wrong they can't and that is it. for those that can walk the mountains know that they can't be beaten not by man. this small thing that moves and builds hoping to match the them.  always we reach for the sky, building things that would make us kings.  for those of us that walk the mountains it is a moment of growth. of becoming. when you are at the bottom you are at the beginning of the the journey and even if you do not reach the top. you will never be the same. and that is the real reason to go to them. you walk the path, you do it to change to become more then you are and leave that which you are behind. at the bottom of the mountain. we all want to change; to be if not someone else more than what we are. the thing is we do not know, how to change how to make that first step that is the beginning of the journey. we want to change but we fear it. and with good reason. because we do not control the change;only the desire to change. who we become is not always up to us. and worst the first change may not be the right one and then we face the disappointment of having to change yet again. it is not like a snake shedding it's skin. for at the end of that shedding it still remains a snake. and we want to be more. that is the moment that you walk the mountain. on the mountain you change over and over each day never the same each day a time to live with the understanding that there is no death. only birth and life. 
there is something true that must be considered, that must be said. I walk the mountain. I do not climb it. and I have no desire to reach the peak. there is no fear. the peak is the end. and I still want to change."

"event","the wind picked up, the scent of trees and water began to fill the area. Lex toke a slow deep breath, letting it out just as slow. his hands were in his pockets. he did not want to take them out. He knew himself, he would reach for clark. there was a longing inside of him to touch the other man. He had touched clark before, but only as a friend, nothing more. 
Lex looked at clark, the water form the river give his skin a glossy shine. 
there was a longing to touch 
Lex let his eyes drop, roving over clarks body. 
were did that come from; the need to touch.  
he didn't understand, all his life he had avoid causal touching of another person, even when having sex. He had always left the bed and the room right after, never sleeping over.
but now,now he wanted to touch and be touched 
somewhere in between the last time he stood on the bridge and now he had changed. 
funny, he know that he had changed; becoming something other and more then what he had been; bright, strong, someone looking ahead. 
He wanted a future, a place. 
Lexcore. had been a trail run. mustly to see what his father would do. 
it had been also to see what he could do. 
could he create a place; for himself?, could he creat something bigger then he was?. 
the answer had been YES.
looking at clark, he knew, other questions had become more important.
Lex also know that, these question were not going to be answered anytime soon. 
for the longest time he had been asking clark 
who he was. 
he never knew why, he had been asking clark that question. but know he did. he had not been asking ""who are you"" he had been asking 
"" who am i "" 
he had been asking clark to see him; recognize that he was there, and to give to him apart of himself that he was always keeping hidden
 and with the ""who am I ? "" there was the 
"" do you like what you see "" 
 he had wanted clark to like what he was seeing
but know he had to ask, did he like what he was seeing. 
"" yes "" clark voice broke the silance that had been growing between them 
he looked at lex
"" yes lex, for us to be togather I would have killed him 
even if he had belived in me."

then louder "" you  hated him "" then shouting "" YOU HATED HIM "" 
"" no Clark "" Lex said keeping his voice even and low. 
"" I hated who he was, I hated the way he was a father to me."" 
Clark stepped closer, his face inches away form him. Lex could feel the warm breath of him on his face. it was good.  memories that had never happed, played across his mind.  there first kiss. knowing and willing, the exchange of breath that is life. 
Lex did not move. 
"" what do you mean you hated the kind of father he was "" the question was staged whispered 
Lex turned his head and looked in to Clarks eyes. without meaning to he lost himself in the blue sky. with a marked effort of will Lex pulled back. and reached into his pocket and pulled out his sunglasses. sledding them on he looked at Clark again. 
"" my father Clark, chose how he was going to raise me. he decide on a campaign that would make me in to a certain kind of person. in his own twisted way he did it because he wanted to make me into a person that would survive anything."" 
Clark backed up a few steps taking his breath with him
 "" he lift you to die Lex, when that mad woman had taken you."" Clark voice began to rise 
"" He abandoned you every time. and, and, he toke your company, the company that you built the one thing that was yours   JUST TO PROVE THAT HE COULD !. 
"" I know"" Lex said 
"" then how can you say that you loved him ""

"" my father believed in me. ""

Lex looked over the river and allowed a  small smile 
"" it began that day in the corn field, were I should have died but didn't"" 
Lex toke another breath 
"" I keep living Clark, there have been other incidents, before I came to smallvill times I should have died but didn't. my father, the man of the twentieth century toke that to mean that I had a great destiny. and the fates would not allowed my death until I had met it."" 
Lex stepped back form the rail and turned placing his hands in his pockets and  looking west toward the great city that he would soon be entering. 
"" it was not a small belief Clark, each time I was in danger my father know that I would get throw. "" 
"" because of your destiny "" there was a edge to Clarks voice. 
Lex did not look at him 
"" yes, because of my destiny ""Lex voice was soft yet the last word seem to linger in the air between them. almost like it was a living thing that did not want to leave
"" tell me Clark, if your father had believed even a little that your fate would be more then a farm boy. would you have still killed him?"""

The thought scrolled across lex's mind as he stepped out of the gray porche. he had not used it since that day 3 years ago. that thought stopped him; has it been that long. has he been this way for that long. He Know the answer was: yes. He had been like this for the last 3 years. longing wanting and never having. 
it should be raining. He thought again. in movies it always rain in moments like this. it't a rule. He was standing where he had been the last time they had been on this bridge
Lex stopped to admire the view. then looked away form clark, and over the side. he did so without hesitation. he had been back here many times to look over and remember. looking up he pulled the though form that hidden place in his mind.  he closed his eyes and began to fly again. in his mind he could still feel the wind passing throw and around his body. he stayed there only a few moments he never stayed very long. that place in his mind was only for a few moments. Lex noted that clark had not spoken since he got here. nor had he stopped looking over the bridge. Lex joined him. neither speaking. should there be words between them. Lex looked over, the frist time they had mite there had not been any-words only feeling. loss, hope, and then the meeting of there eyes when he returned, the Knowledge that the person looking at him was the one.

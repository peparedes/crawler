I never get to say my favorite team is in the finals of anything (hello, LA has a hockey team?...and the San Diego Chargers...?)  BUT NO MORE!!!!  



MY TEAM'S IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS!!!!



Smith is the worst goalie ever.  I hope he gets the clap and loses an arm.  Doughty was robbed and had every right to be angry about the wrong penalty call and that he was offsides.  Stupid, blind referees.  But no matter, Penner pulled out a goal with two minutes left in OT!  So we beat the #1, #2, and #3 seed to get to the Finals, as the #8 seed!    


MY TEAM'S IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS!"

"event","I got food poisoning for the first time that I can remember.  It was a viral food poisoning, probably from a tuna sandwich from my coffee shop (I have one more in the fridge I have to throw out... and here I was excited that I got some free food).  Liz and the internet confirmed that food poisoning can take 12-48 hours to manifest if it is a viral food poisoning (the most common).  This creates all kinds of liquid projections, fever, nausea, aches...etc.  And I had it all.  It all started around 9am yesterday and then progressively got worse.  The fever climbed to 102 and broke around 3am when I was watching episodes of the Wonder Years, because I had basically slept all day and couldn't do it any more.  My body hurt, my joints hurt.  I was dehydrated.  It was the worst.  Today I had no appetite but managed to eat some crackers and half a bowl of chicken soup.  My stomach is still not happy.  So on top of being emotionally a wreck because I don't have any income, and absolutely no money, I now have the pleasure of being a physical wreck as well.  How fun.  If this is as bad as life gets, I'll be very grateful, but shit better turn back around really soon."

I feel that my interviewing skills back in, say, October or November were on point.  I had just passed the bar, the law was still fresh in my mind, and let's face it, my self-esteem is generally too high.  I was indestructible.  Flash forward to 3 months after receiving my bar results, 6 months after taking the bar, and 8 months after graduating from law school... and I am beaten down.  My confidence is lacking, I'm sick of being ignored by every single firm I send my resume to.  I've been to 4 legal temp agencies and filled with false promises, only to still be waiting for some form of work.  ""There's plenty of staffing opportunities for you.""  ""I staffed 200 people in the last two weeks, it's been mad in here!""  ""I wont be surprised if you get a job by next week.""   Lies.  All of 'em, lies.  And then for the firms that post false ads:  I spent a good 30+ minutes tailoring my resume and cover letter for each firm before I apply.  So it should come as no surprise how frustrating it is when I receive a standard email back within the hour stating that the position (which was posted on Craigslist yesterday!) has already been filled.  Come on!

"event","1.  Table-side prepared guacamole:  Guacamole is not expensive to make and truly good guacamole does not require a million ingredients as many lame-ass ""Mexican"" restaurants in the District lead you to believe.  My dad, as a guacamole purist, enjoys a small squeeze of lime, salt, a dash of garlic powder and that's it.  I enjoy adding more ingredients like chopped cilantro and hot sauce, but not much else.  Guacamole doesn't need more or else you can't taste the avacado (which is what you're paying for).  Real restaurants know this, but the shitty restaurants (think along the lines of Cafe Atlantico, and Rosa Mexicana)  get away with charging $8-10 for two avacados worth of ""guacamole"" because they mash the avacado at your table and allow you to choose which ingredients you want from their shitty mise en place.  It's the worst!  (I assumed Loriol Plaza did this as well, since their food, kitsch, and popularity is absolutely the worst, but I was wrong... they still suck).        

2.  Crazes that go on for too long in D.C., like cupcakes and ""upscale"" burgers.  Those trends are over and for good reason!  Get with the times, D.C.-  give me the local beer, ramen shops, and macaroons that have been big in NY for over a year now!  Stop opening new cupcake shops!  Sprinkles, don't you see the line wrapped around the corner of Georgetown Cupcakes (arguably the worst, but coincidentally the most popular, cupcake shop in D.C.)?  Why would you want to open a nearby shop?!?  Fools!  

3.  Fried food for happy hour:  Why is it that the only food on most happy hour menus are fried?!  It makes me both mad and fat.  I enjoy the occasional 1/2 price cocktails and $1 oysters at places like Urbana and Hank's, but usually I'm in the mood for a cold, delicious beer.  So when I end up at virtually any bar in the District and throw back a couple of pints, I often find myself in need of a snack.  Especially now that my friends and I remain essentially unemployed, the need for making a meal out of a happy hour is crucial.  Often 
(I'm going with 95% of the time), the only items on the menu are either fried or covered in cheese.  Nachos, fries, wings, croquettes, taquitos, quesadillas, onion rings, fried pickles, ... and the double disaster- fried mac-n-cheese.  I was at Acadiana last week and their half price apps menu consisted of 14 items (8 of which were fried... aside form the oysters, the rest of the items weren't any better)  Come on people- give us some healthy-er alternatives!  Anyone who knows me knows that I am all for fattening food so long as it's delicious...but this fried food thing is getting ridiculous.     


4.  Georgetown Cupcakes:  Yes GC, you got your own bullet point- I loathe you that much.  First, you started the trend in D.C., so kudos to you.  But somehow the idea that cupcakes were the best dessert in the entire world infiltrated every person's mushy brain and the trend has NEVER stopped.  NEVER!  In almost 4 years!  Then you got a ridiculous ""reality"" television show on TLC (I can say ridiculous, because I watched 2 episodes) that cannot possibly be even remotely based on reality, because if it was- you two girls are the worst business owners ever and have no business running a... well, business(seriously, you built a giant cupcake mask for a mardi gras party and forgot to see if it would fit through the office's doors first?!?  Come on.).  This show increased their popularity and now the lines don't just go out the door-  There is not a time that I have driven by and not seen the line at least 30 deep.  Ridiculous for cupcakes that are more often than not dry and often have a cream cheese frosting when it should be buttercream.  Gah!


5.  ""Upscale""/ ""Gourmet"" burger joints:  I spent too long getting angry at the 4 aforementioned peeves, so this will be brief.  Why is this trend so popular when Ray's Hell Burger and Palena exist?  There is no way to compete with them.  Also, if people want a good burger, there's a 5-guys on practically every corner and pretty much any local bar does a fine job with a juicy grilled burger.  So why are the likes of Bobby Flay & Co opening burger joints as if the world depended on it?  I don't want to spend $8 for a small, ""gourmet"" burger when I can spend less than that and sink my teeth into the best burger of my life at Ray's.  It's infuriating, and these shops are taking up the space that could be used for better endeavors... like ramen!"

"event","Went home for Thanksgiving weekend for the first time in at least three years.  Momma bought me a ticket so I was super excited to return back to the family and cook a big feast.  Clare did not allow that to happen due to family drama.  Instead Bood and I decided to have host our own immediate family Thanksgiving 2.0 on Saturday after the traditional Bearsh-controlled event.  Thanksgiving wasn't so controlled, I don't exactly see why everyone was fussing that the food is bad usually... I thought it tasted pretty good.  Saturday's was better though... everything is better with bacon (and when I cook it)!    

Went out to West Hollywood (WeHo) for the first time ever.  I am not West Coast.  It made me miss my gays and their casual non-flamboyant nature.  I had fun hanging out with HC and Boodst though.  

Ate way too much Mexican food.  There is really nothing much better than a bunch of carnitas, beans and rice.  I may or may not have gained about 4 pounds during my endeavor to satiate my carnitas cravings, but it was entirely worth it.  Coming back home from eating nothing but meat, carbs, and fat has me cleansing my body and trying to regain normalcy in my diet.  I swear, my family doesn't eat healthily at all.  I ran 4.5 miles yesterday and have had nothing but veggies & fruit juice for the past 24 hours;although my tummy is rumbling, I'm okay.  It's good for me (and tonight I'm happy houring with Bui at Acadiana so I will be eating drinking there).    

I miss my family- and they didn't hound me about moving home that much... I am a bit nervous their demeanor was a ploy.  Either way I had a great time and am excited to go back on the 19th.  Especially because it means I get to see Pinche finally.  Not getting to see her made both Bood and I quite mad, but hopefully this sentiment will be culled come a Christmas time filled with lots of hanging out, peeptips, and Jewish Coffee Cake (I think I deserve the recipe for you blowing me off, Pinj!)."

So I took the Virginia bar.  Finished this Wednesday.  Went back to Ventucky for 2.5 months, studied my ass off then flew back to the humidity, donned by best, most air-conditioned suit and headed to Roanoke, where I spent six hours on Tuesday and Wednesday test taking.  It was amazing.  I wanted to throw up on day one and then on day two I had to fight to keep myself in the seat, because I was so over it.  Yeay the bar!  The second Liz and I were done we ran to Loretta and booked it back up the 81 to our livelihood.  Our friends were waiting for us in celebration, but all we wanted to do was sleep.  I slept until 6:30pm the next day.  It was weird.  Since then we have been hanging out with friends; saying hello to people we havent seen in months and saying goodbye to the sad few that are leaving us.  It's been nice.  I can't believe I have to start seriously thinking about the future.  I can't believe people are going to start paying me (hopefully) for being a lawyer.  I love it so much...it seems surreal.  Jobs aren't supposed to be fun.  I am also really excited to start dating again.  I need to make out with someone.  Before was just to get my feet wet, but now I think I may be ready.  Who knows.  I may never be actually ready or over it, but I sincerely feel it's time.  My friends are all serious in their partnerships and I'm not- so it's time to shape up and find someone who wants to shape up with me.  Yeay growing up; three cheers for that.

"event","Instead of actually being at Gold Cup, I am laying in bed and will continue to lay here until I can go back to sleep and wake up more towards the afternoon.  I will not be attending Gold Cup.  Fall is my favorite one.  The leaves have changed, it's brisk, beautiful and the perfect time to break out a scarf and cardigan.  It's the perfect setting to enjoy some bourbon and watch some horses.  Today's high is going to be 70 and sunny, the perfect fall weather.  I am jealous.  Jealous and sad that I wont be there.  Some things were taken from me that had nothing to do with the relationship and it's not fair.  One day, I want Gold Cup or to find my equivalent."

"event","Happy October!  

This is my favorite month of the year (minus one questionably retarded day) and it took me until now to realize September had finally left us.  First thing I did- break out the Halloween decorations!  All of September I kept walking by my hall closet sneaking peeks at my shelves of decorations.  I constantly tried to talk myself into putting up just the autumn themed things and I showed great restraint until now.  I don't have time to put them all up today, I just wanted to sift through and enjoy them.  They are currently sprawled out on my couches awaiting their placement for the month.  I hope my roommate doesn't mind them there till tomorrow.  Oh well.  
  
Needless to say, I am quite excited for this month and am kicking it all off with Oktoberfest celebrations at Biergarten Haus tonight.  Nothing says 'October is here' quite like wursts, beer and german music!  But before tonight's festivities I must continue studying for Monday's PR midterm and enjoy my first (and last) pumpkin spice latte of the season from Starbucks."

"event","I have finally figured out why I cannot seem to concentrate on my classes and clients this summer.  I seems that I don't care about anything.  I don't feel too bad at this point, but I am content to just sit around in front of the tv or computer nowadays.  I do nothing.  I go out because I have to maintain my friendships, but I don't really care.  I have completely stopped caring.  Which is sad, but no amount of me thinking I may fail a class has scared me into trying.  Slipping from my number 1 position should scare me, but it doesn't anymore.  I have to get out of this, but have no idea how. My friends may be able to help now that I can pinpoint what the heck is wrong with me."

Today I was supposed to work on my school work, but didn't.  I really hope I don't fail anything this summer.  My procrastination is getting ridiculous and I don't want to blame a certain event on my lack of desire to do anything, but I am going to.  At least until I fail...eek.  I have to get out of this funk."

This morning I went to the Dupont farmer's market for the first time and it was as great as I thought it was.  Everything made me a little sad though.  We never got up in time to go to it before.  They had lots of little herb pots which reminded me that I was going to plant a little window box.

I kept it all together till I hopped on the the metro.  There's been a downward spiral since.  I just want him to comfort me.

I have never seen a Carrabba's commercial until today.  Of course.  Fuck you Carrabbas.

...Finally decided to eat something today.  The last half of my Forlano's italian hoagie.  I cried taking out of the fridge.  And then again at the last bite.  Crying with food in your mouth is difficult."

Hendricks got 30%+ of the votes- not only is this awesome for the reds of the world, but for the curvy chicks as well.....yes:  http://www.esquire.com/women/women-issue/christina-hendricks-sexy-0510?click=pp#img

I could eat it plain and the scent is amazing.  After reading this article, I like to think my love of cilantro helps establish that I am more removed from cavemen than others.  I'm more evolved.

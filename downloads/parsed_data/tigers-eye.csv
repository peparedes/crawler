"event","<b>WARNING: VERY LONG</b><i> if you even START to read this.... don't unless you intend to read it ALL the way through, NO skimming. IF you read this.... listen to what I have said, take it into your life, and relationships. It is important and it should be read.... but since it is so lengthy.... unless you intend to</i> <b>READ</b> <i>it: Stop here. if you really intend to read it: don't do it when you are tired and can't think straight. You wont understand.</i>

I know I havn't been a very honest person in the past, and I know I made a lot of mistakes, but now I know that honesty is the biggest thing in a relationship. If one person doesn't tell the other something.... no matter how small, it will infringe on the relationship, and hurt trust. Big things make it harder for one person to trust the other again, but in time the trust is repaired. Situations like that..... the situation will never be ok, but the person who was the victim in the situation, will eventualy heal, and trust the other again, letting their ties be ok, even if the situation was not. Everone deserves a second chance..... especially if you love them. And even if one person is still keeping something from the other, that other person will trust them about everything, and hope that the other person is in fact telling the truth. Holding on by a limb, the other person will hold on until that limb iether breaks, or until they can climb back up again. If someone trusts you, you should never lie to them.... if someone trusts you, you should tell them the truth about everything, even if it seems like the other person may be angry once they know the truth. The truth should be told in the first place, otherwise it causes more pain than should EVER be caused. and if there are things that you still hold secret from that person who trusts you, and loves you.... you're not only hurting them, but yourself as well. You never know when the other may find out about something that you're keeping secret. If you have secrets from the one you love, then maybe you don't really love them or know them like you think. If you REALLY TRUELY love the person your with.... you'll tell them EVERYTHING you are hiding, no matter how small it is. What has happened in the past month has tought me that. I myself never meant to lie, I myself have made bad descisions, but afterward, when I finaly spoke with Kaity about those things.... I told her EVERYTHING she wanted to know. And I trust she's doing that for me now.... even if she wasn't... I still love her and trust her, and I wouldn't be angry if she told me anything else. But I know in my heart there isn't anything else left out, and she deserves another chance. I love her too much NOT to give her another chance. I'm holding on to a limb, yes..... but I'm willing to go out on that limb and climb my way back on it. I know from this, I will not keep any secrets from Kaity like I did before. I'm done lying to her, and I'm done fighting with her, and I'm done keeping secrets from her. I want this all to be over. I trust everything. Maybe I'm naieve for doing that..... maybe love has made me blind. But I trust her and she deserves a chance. I just hope that it's all over. I hope that I know everything.... but like I said..... even if I don't, and I found something else out that Kaity kept secret, I wouldn't be angry, and I'd just be glad I knew the truth. But I trust her, and I know that there's nothing else I need to worry about between us. I'm getting this all off my chest. I've learned the lesson I've stated above, and I trust Kaity has too. These are our bonds..... love..... and TRUST. That's what a relationship is supposed to be. Without trust, and truth in a relationship... it's not worth staying in, unless you can fix it. And after you fix it once.... it should never happen again, or continue after the trust has been mended between the pair. No lies, No secrets, No fear of the other, Love, Understanding, And Passion... those are the ingredients for a truely workable relationship. If you truely love one another, you'll never keep secrets..... because you should not be afraid of what the other person will do.... if they love you, they will understand and work it out with you, they wont blow up like some sort of maniac and break off the relationship. If they love you..... the secrets no matter how big or small will not matter, and you WILL be able to work it out. But if you keep secrets from the one you love, and you lie to them.... then you don't love them as much as you say you do.

All in all..... Tell the truth, don't leave out things, don't keep secrets, and don't lie again when you get caught IF you lie in the first place.... Come out straight up, and tell the truth. If the person your with truely loves you. They'll talk to you, and work it out, and try to understand..... But if you keep a secret, let it go too far, and have the person you love find out the hard way.... it only causes them MORE pain. Especially if you continue to lie, and leave out details. All-in-all.... if you love them, you wont lie, and if they love you.... no matter what you tell them..... it wont matter, as long as you can talk it out and not fight, or yell or get angry. It's all just trust.

I love you Kaity. And I wrote this so you know how much I trust you now. I wrote this because it's the way I feel, and it's the way I want to do things from now on. I want us both to be completely honest, and I'm going to look at this entry as many times as I can to tell you if I have somethng that needs to be said. I have no secrets from you anymore, I havn't meant to lie to you, I havn't meant to hurt you, and I havn't meant to keep brooding on the events of this past month. I trust you completely again, and I love you completely, I always have. It's never changed. I may have been agry with you a few times, but I never stopped loveing you. If there's anything.... EVER..... that you're afraid of telling me..... don't be, I wont flip out as long as you just tell me. You don't have to be afraid of my reactions baby. I just want the truth from you from now on, and I will give it to you as well.... and I want you to keep me to that, just like I'm keeping you to the promise you made. I know everything will work out..... just tell me if you have a secret that you would normaly think I'd blow up on, or whatever.... just tell me the truth, and I promis I won't freak, I'll just talk to you about it. I promise.... I promise I'll do the same if there's anything that you need to know. No matter how small or big.... I WILL tell you. I'm done lying, and I trust you are too. I love you. Forever and always. I always have, I never lost one bit of that feeling for you through all this. I mean it with everything I am, and all of myself, and everything that I could ever give you....... I LOVE YOU! Only YOU! FOREVER. We just have to be honest from now on. We can't hurt eachother anymore, we can't keep things from eachother anymore. No matter how things play out in our heads.... we should tell the other what's gong on. No matter how big the situation, no matter what..... no more lies, no matter what..... no more being afraid of what iether of us will do. If we love eachother.... we can, and will work it out, no matter what it is. I'm done with all the pain, I'm done with hurting you, I'm done being untrusting over this.... as long as your totaly honest with me.... just as I will be with you..... we never have to worry. I love you baby. I want you to know that. And because of it..... I wrote this. And it's late.... so I hope I worded it so that is sounds just like I meant it. I love you kaity..... no more.... no more fighting, and distrust. I just want everything to be right. Read this from time to time, just as I will to remind yourself of what we have, of who I am, and of what I feel for you. I hope you know that you can come to me with anything. Even if it's something big, or small. I just want the truth.... just like you do. I want to make things right.... and I need your help to do it. I love you."

"event","I'm 17 now. It's odd... my life feels like it really has flashed before my eyes. It's scary thinking about the fact that I'll be gone in a year (From my house, and high school). I wish I knew what the future holds for me. I'm scared. All I can do is try as hard as I can now while I still have a slight chance to make it. I have to bust my butt for the rest of this year and next.

I wish I knew why I make so many mistakes. I wish I knew why I do the things I do, I just don't know what I'm thinking half the time, I just need to think before I say, or do something I know I'll regret, and I need to remember promises better. I need a better memory. I still say I have some type of mental problem. I want the best for me and Kaity. I just wish I'd stop hurting her, I wish I'd stop being the one to cause fights. I don't want to fight with her, I don't want to hurt her, I just want to give her everything. Because that's what she is to me, and that's what she deserves. I love her with all my heart, and I can't help but hate the things I've done to her. I've hurt her emotionaly too many times. And all I know is I want to spend the rest of my life fixing it. Even if she says it's ok, I want to fix it.

I wish Kaity would talk to me if she's depressed. Her last couple of journal entries have me worried. She hasn't seemed like anything is wrong. I thought she was fairly happy. Kaity baby, please talk to me :(.

I love you Kaity. Always. :)

"event","Wow, I havn't updated this year at all, I've been rally buisy and all, and there've been a lot of things going on. Work isn't as good as it could be, I think I'm going to get fired because I've been late twice, and I didn't know I had to work last night so I wasn't there. I hope Nanci will be leanient on me. Kaity and I will be celebrating our 1 year on the 11th :D It hasn't seemed that long, really. I love her with all my heart, and nothing in this world can ever change that.

              I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me with homework, I need to get ALL of it in, not just some, I'm screwed if I don't. I'm getting my act together now *Smashes head with keyboard* there we go... I just need to do it. I mean yeah, so it doesn't give me a lot of time to do the stuff I want, but in the long run.... it'll be worth it. I need to fix it. I need to do it, and quit kidding myself. It all needs to get done. I have a chance right NOW to turn in math stuff I've missed, and that'll help my grade before the 6 weeks is up.... that's right around the corner, careening towards us at a frightening rate. I'm eligable for my lisence now, and if my grades are satisfactory.... guess what.... the t-bird is MINE. mwahahaha. But i need to aim just for the grades now, not the prize. That's my goal.... get it together so that everything will fall into place.


              I've been trying to figure everything out, with my parents and all. I thought they were breathing down my neck, but I realize it's them just trying to help, just trying to scare me into fixing it, just them giving me advice, and I just need to take it and stop being defensive. I put too much stress on them, and they don't need it. It's MY stress, I need to keep it to myself and not let it off on ANYONE. I need to loosen it for myself. I need to clear my mind, and fix the problem inside of me..... laziness. I was beginning to become jaded from all of it, but now i think I know what to do. I NEED to go to college, and i NEED to save up money... (after this month) so I can help pay for an appartment, my insurance, utilities, food, and college. I need a better plan that what I had before, I was just letting things happen to me, I was living day-by-day.... no more, I'm done worrying.... only I can fix it. I need to look twenty miles down the road, I need to look to how my future will be if I don't get myself together. 

My priorities come as follows:
1.) Kaity, and giving her the future she deserves by fixing it now.
2.) Getting my lisence... It will happen, but my main focus is life, preparing for it, preparing to make it better
3.)My job, i need the money
3.5)friends. Sorry if that offends anyone, but I can't help that I'm worried about what's going to happen AFTER high school. There'll be time to hang out, but not as often as it used to be.
4.)The little stuff, It'll come to me on it's own, the reward of working hard.

I need to fix it now, need to fix my future from the damage I've done to it by not doing my work. I need to fix it NOW.

Suprisingly, I'm calm about this, it's a big deal, but I know I can do it."

I also got two of my presents today...
Kaity bought me this really cool chinese knife that I've been trying to buy for a while, and it's REALLY cool. It's got this Jadeish handle and scabbard, and thisneat chain that connects the knife to the scabbard. and it has red tassles on the butt of the handle.

Rory and nicky bought me a samurai weapons set.... Katana, Wakizashi, and Tanto on a sword rack.... it's really cool too.... I'm getting so many sharp objects for christmas.

I got a job at Liberty Heights for 7 bucks an hour as waitstaff. It's really not as bad as I thought it would be. The old people are nice to me, and so are my co-workers.... except for Jessica Loblick..... I hate her like no one else. But otherwise it's cool. I've been working for the past 4 days, for like 4 hours a day.

The other night, I took out the car because it started by itself..... I got to the wal mart parking lot, turned it off, and it didn't start again, so it got stuck there.... I'm kinda in deep..... but I'm not sure...

and yeah.... 2 DAYS!!!!! mwhahahahahahahaha
I love x-mas
I love kaity
I'm really happ[y right now

So anyway. yeah, life is going ok. I'm almost flat broke because of buing presents. I'm getting a Job at liberty heights (hopefuly) and my grades are coming up. I had a job for a little while at this Kiosk in the mall, but the pay stunk so I quit and went for LH. I bought Kaity a REALLY neat present. I'm proud of myself for buying it. For those of you who know what it is.... DON'T SAY A WORD OR I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A POST... I have special plans on how to give it to her... so don't spoil what it is.

I'm happy for Kaity. She got a new cavalier for those of you who havn't seen her latest journal entry. She's having a lot of fun with it. I'm getting my lisence in february... so I'll be able to drive Kaity on a date for our 1-year. Hehe, I'm excited about that too. I love her with all of my heart, and I know I'll never be able to be without her. SHe's in my very soul everytime I think about her. She's there all the time (shows you how much I think about her :D ALL the time). I just want to see her happy, and make her happy.

I'm getting a Beretta M-92 airsoft gun. And Brain gave me his blue diving knife.... it's REALLY cool. (Thanks Brian, I hope you enjoy that insence) And that gun is coming tomorrow prolly.... if not today :P

I'm just in a really good mood right now. I wanna talk to Kaity, but she's still at work, and I miss her. But all in all today was ok.

I'm also getting better at the guitar. My mom got me lessons and I'm getting better :D Now i just have to learn to sing while playing (even tho I can't sing) but yeah.

I love christmas time. It's nice and everyone is happy (mostly) and I love giving. I had $700 and I spent $600 on everyone. I just threw a budget out the window since I'm getting a new job. I love sitting by the tree for some reason.... I've don it since I was little... just sit there... looking at it, listening to the sounds of the electric ornaments. I love the feeling you get around this time.

My power supply cam for my comp the other day (obviously) and I have my music back! mwahahaha! I can't live without it.

Brian: I MAY not be able to get a zippo unless you want one from like.... spencers with the phrases or pics on them. But I'll try to find you a decent one.

Kami: I have no Idea what to get you.... so you may get a late gift.

Ben: I have NO idea

Kaity: You already know I have something for you.... but I'm still gunna get you that eclipse poster, and I hope trogdor lives lol.

Who else do I need to get gifts for??

but yeah.... if anyone wants to get me a semi cheap gift..... An airsoft sticky target.... that'd be cool:D

but yeah. Everything's good. I'm in a happy mood :P"

"event","Well.... I guess I'll start off with the biggest thing that's happened to me.
I went to get a job at MCI, and I got an interveiw for the day after I applied, So I was excited and happy. My mom came to pick me up from the MCI building (this was the day I applied) and she started saying how she wasn't sure about it, but she'd let me do it anyway. So I was happy and ready and all excited, and then that night, she comes in my room, and tells me SHE'S not ready for ME to have a job, when it's MY life, and MY desicion to get one... I'm almost 17, I need money. They aren't saving up for college for me, so becuase of that, to me it's saying they think I'm a failure. So I need to make money so I can go to college, get a car, be able to be mostly on my feet when I move out. I need to start now, while the startin is good. Especialy if I can get the job at MCI. 7.50 an hour, plus comission, is good for a first job, and will really help me. My parents are treating me like I'm 5.... not 17. UGH! I wish I could just leave now so I could be free to get my own life.

I love Kaity, With all my heart, it's true. I don't care if everyone thinks we are too young to know what love is.... You never are too young to know, and Kaity and I know. We feel so strongly for eachother, we have an unbreakable bond. She and I will be together, I know it deep down. She makes me happy, she makes everything better, and I love her.

I hope everything will get better like she says. There is so much more going on than what I just posted, I'm just to tired to do it.

I love you Kaity. Talk to you allo later."

Ah well.... one piece of me lost.... I can replace it.... but it won't have the same sentimental value. That's really the only bad thing that's happened so far :P Yesterday we went to bellows beach and boogie boarded, I got a bit of a sunburn (hopefuly a tan by the time I get back) and almost got killed... but that's ok.... it's hawaii! I love the beach. I wish colorado had a beach :( We would have so much more fun at home with a beach. now when we got here....day 1.... we got into the hotel and immediatly went to the beach. We have a lincoln navagator for a rental car.... I WANT ONE!!!! NICE NICE car. Anyway. I just got back in from a lazy day. I think this is the most relaxed I have been inb a VERY long time. God I miss Kaity. I miss everyone a lot. I really miss Kaity cause I see all these couples walking down the beach... and then i think of her.... and I walk in the sand.... and I think of her being next to me..... I miss her....

Well... I should go to bed now seeing as it's midnight here. And have to golf tomorrow. so... I'll update as much as I can.
See you all in a week.

I love you Kaity!!! TRY TO GET ON THE PHONE!!!! lol I wanna talk to you so bad!

Everyone keep pushing me please :P that way I wont fall behind.... that could be the biggest favor you all do for me this year. I would really appreciate the pushing from you guys. But anyway... This time tomorrow I'll prolly be walking on Waikiki beach thinkin bout Kaitlyn. Part of me doesn't wanna go but the other does. I don't think you'd understand unless you have someone you love and you were going somewhere (even as nice as Hawaii) really far away, you'd miss them the whole time. Ah well.... Sooner or later spring break'll be here and our group'll be in Florida (if everything goes to plan.)

My dad gave me a half a grand ($500 for those of you who have never heard that expression before) which really is.... a lot...I've never had more thatn 150 in my posession at one time

ah well.... I'm lookin forward to the plane ride... It's always fun (no joke). I love flying.

Aloha!"

Justin Jeered
Rolling Stones fans don't appreciate Timberlake.
by BeatBoxBetty

Okay, so who was the brainiac who thought Rolling Stones fans would enjoy hearing ""Cry Me A River"" or ""Rock Your Body"" from former 'N Sync-er Justin Timberlake?  Whoever it was, they're definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed.

At the recent Stones concert to revive tourism in Toronto after the SARS outbreak, the pop singer did not receive the warmest of welcomes from the crowd. In fact, he had to dodge both water bottles and insults that were being flung from the audience. While he tried to convince the rebellious rock fans it would all ""be over before you know it,"" the angry villagers just booed and jeered him throughout his entire set.

Later he reappeared with back-up reinforcements (Mick Jagger and Keith Richards) who tried to guilt the audience into give him a chance. Richards even stared down the crowd and motioned to them to show some respect. Talk about a hostile take-over!

It's so *sniff* wonderful!"

"event","I seriously think I'll be leaving here (my house) once I get a job. <lj-cut text=""God I wish they were normal"">The second I get that job..... I'll be out of my house. I seriously don't think I could stay here another year, or two for that matter. I mean, for gods sake.... theres no point of living in a place where no one respects you, no one gives you real privacy, and you are treated like dirt. My mom told me to leave.... so why shouldn't I? tell me that. Why shouldn't I just finish packing and leave? They would have one less person to buy groceries for. They would have one less person to ask them for things, they could take me off their insurance.... and they could sell my ticket to hawaii.... maby THEN they'd stop fighting about money.... they'd be saving enough of it. Lets put it this way.... I do what my parents tell me to do a lot. They don't realize it but I do. And I take my mom seriously, and when she said... ""You might as well leave"" then i'll listen, I'm ready to pick up my belongings, and go. whatever I leave behind they can sell for all I care. I am seriously blown away from the fact the she said that to me. and the fact that she flipped out JUST because I made up a little white lie to go water skiing..... Someone tell me why that is such a big deal.... please.... I still don't understand why she would flip out just because I wanted to go water skiing and she was too over protective to let me in the first place. So I had to tell her something else in order to go have some fun. It's not like SHE never lied to HER parents... I mean come on! And then she goes off to cry to my Dad.... Gets HIM pissed off at me. And now, niether one of them wanna listen to me. I should leave... I'm half packed.... I should finish and go.... I'll find a way to make it on my own from nothing. I don't have ANY money in my wallet. and I only have $4 in my bank... not including the 20 in savings I can't touch. If there is anyone out there that is willing to house me untill I'm on my feet.... Please tell me. So I know there's somewhere I can go untill I can pay rent somewhere.... and to what I would owe to the friend that housed me. Please.... someone tell me what I should do... I'm seriously ready to go.... Last entry I said, ""One more thing and I'm outta here"" I meant that.... and I'm getting ready to go. I hate it here... Nothing is ever stable.... nothing matters to iether one of my parents but money. My mom said she feels like she and I have grown apart..... well.... if she thinks that then I can't stop her... I felt close to her until she said that. Now I feel like I have been seperated from my family. She has my brother against me, she has my Dad against me, she's against me.... fuck it.... I'm leaving. Someone tell me if I can crash at your place for a little while.... And I'll be indebted to you. I have no point in staying here anymore. I've wanted to leave so many times before... and I almost did, but I decided to take the trial and stay.... I can NOT stand two more years here. The only thing keeping me sane at all is Kaitlyn. She's the only thing that is keeping me from going back to old habbits. Some not all... But without her.... I'd be lost right now. And if you re thinking I will be dropping out of school.... you're dead wrong. I'll work from end of school to 12 at night if that's what I will have to do to support myself.... I just need a good paying job. I need my education in order to have a better life. I can't belive they could flip out over something so simple.... But the result of this for them will be... losing me. When I got home my mom says... ""I missed you, I don't know what I'll do when you're gone! *sniff sniff*"" you know what... I guess that was bullshit... because I tell her right after that, that we went water skiing, and then ten minuets later I hear her say ""If your gunna do that, and do what you want against us... you might as well not live here, you should leave."" well you know what... I think I will. She told me to leave so you know what.... I'll listen to her, it'll be better than sitting here listening to her cry about my brother and the shit he got himself in, or my Dad being a jerk about money, or my school work. You know what.... If I cause them sooo much hell all the time then, I should just go, and give them less grief.</lj-cut> If anyone but brian is against me doing this.... then tell me."

You are.. 
Not a Chicken!
You're not a chicken at all, in fact - you're downright fearless.. which is scary... or at least, you try to make out that you're fearless... good luck - you'll be dead from tackling a mafia mob single-handedly by the time you're 20. If you're already 20... fate must be on your side ;)"

"event","A philosophy professor stood before his class and had
 some items in front of him. When the class began,
 wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise jar
 and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2
 inches in diameter.  He then asked the students if the
 jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the
 professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured
 them into the jar.  He shook the jar lightly. The
 pebbles,of course, rolled into the open areas between
 the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar
 was full.  They agreed it was.

 The students laughed. The professor picked up a box of
 sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand
 filled the remaining space between the pebbles and the
 rocks. ""Now,"" said the professor, ""I want you to
 recognize that this is your life.  The rocks are the
 important things - your family, friends, your partner,
 your health, your children - things that if everything
 else was lost and only they remained, your life would
 still be full. The pebbles are the other things that
 matter like your job, your house, your car. The sand
 is everything else.  The small stuff.""

 ""If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no
 room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for
 your life. If you spend all your time and energy on
 the small stuff, you will never have room for the
 things that are important to you.  Pay attention to
 the things that are critical to your happiness. Play
 with your children. Take time to get medical checkups.
 Take your partner out dancing. There will always be
 time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner
 party and fix the disposal. Take care of the rocks
 first - the things that really matter. Set your
 priorities. The rest is just sand.""

 But then ...

 A student took the jar which the other students and
 the professor agreed was full, and proceeded to pour
 in a glass of beer. Of course the beer filled the
 remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly
 full.

 Which proves: no matter how full your life is,there is
 always room for a beer."

On a chain around her neck
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
It was a time I won't forget
For the sorrow and regret
And the shape of a heart
And the shape of a heart
I guess I never knew
What she was talking about
I guess I never knew
What she was living without

People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove
Speak in terms of belief and belonging
Try to fit some name to their longing

There was a hole left in the wall
From some ancient fight
About the size of a fist
Or something thrown that had missed
And there were other holes as well
In the house where our nights fell
Far too many to repair
In the time that we were there

People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Reach out to each other though the push and shove
Speak in terms of a life and the learning
Try to think of a word for the burning

You keep it up
You try so hard
To keep a life from coming apart
And never know
What breaches and faults are concealed
In the shape of a heart

It was the ruby that she wore
On a stand beside the bed
In the hour before dawn
When I knew she was gone
And I held it in my hand
For a little while
And dropped it into the wall
Let it go, heard it fall

I guess I never knew
What she was talking about
I guess I never knew
What she was living without
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove
Speak in terms of a life and the living
Try to find the word for forgiving

You keep it up
You try so hard
To keep a life from coming apart
And never know
The shallows and the unseen reefs
That are there from the start
In the shape of a heart"

Of the lovers up and down the strand
In the sound of the waves and the cries
Of the seagulls circling the sand
In the fragments of the songs
Carried down the wind from some radio
In the murmuring of the city in the distance
Ominous and low

I hear the sound of the world where we played
And the far too simple beauty
Of the promises we made

If you ever need holding
Call my name, I'll be there
If you ever need holding
And no holding back, I'll see you through
Sky blue and black

Where the touch of the lover ends
And the soul of the friend begins
There's a need to be separate and a need to be one
And a struggle neither wins
Where you gave me the world I was in
And a place I could make a stand
I could never see how you doubted me
When I'd let go of your hand

Yeah, and I was much younger then
And I must have thought that I would know
If things were going to end

And the heavens were rolling
Like a wheel on a track
And our sky was unfolding
And it'll never fold back
Sky blue and black

And I'd have fought the world for you
If I thought that you wanted me to
Or put aside what was true or untrue
If I'd known that's what you needed
What you needed me to do

But the moment has passed by me now
To have put away my pride
And just come through for you somehow

If you ever need holding
Call my name, I'll be there
If you ever need holding
And no holding back, I'll see you through

You're the color of the sky
Reflected in each store-front window pane
You're the whispering and the sighing
Of my tires in the rain
You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost
In everything I do
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you
In the sunlight and the shadows
And the faces on the avenue
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
Sky blue and black"

"event","<Text color = ""white"">God, People can be so ignorant sometimes. All my life my grandparents have given my family grief. This was my 16th birthday, I allowed them to come up for one last chance. They wouldn't have come if my cousin hadn't been with them. The are as selfish as they are ignorant, they are as ignorant as they are seductive, they are as seductive as they are pesemistic they are as pesemistic as they are vain. They don't know how to see the good in ANYTHING. They criticize my mom when she tried everything to make the basement more comfortable and clean and neat and nice. She painted the walls, she bought new furnature and had all of the carpets steam cleaned. All they can say and see is ""There's a lot of dog shit in your yard."" Last night tore everything from this week and all hell broke loose. How bout I start at the beginning.

At my parents wedding my mom asked my grandmother if they could be close. But with her ignorance and ""Country club"" attitude made her turn my mom away. And long after that It went down hill. Then my brother was born, They came to see him as a newborn, perfect, nothing wrong with him. Then twelve years later they begin to criticize a little boy, I mean for crying out loud he's a boy still. They were so ignorant that they couldn't see that. That's when our family REALLY began to tear away from them. Then I came... Heh, They didn't come to see me, they never wanted us. Then as I was growing up I never got anything from them but cloths. No ""I love you"", Just me saying it and them turning me away. How do people get like that? HOW!? Its just not right.

While everything was going on with shit like that, they had been brainwashing my aunt, uncle, and cousin (not the one that was here) and everytime they see one of us they OPENLY point out flaws. Like they are flawless and it's their job to tell everyone else that they aren't. They have the biggest flaws out of the entire family. They are cold heartless.... THINGS. I can't even call them people. Thats too high of praise for them. They called me fat for a long time, I WAS A FREAKING KID! Until I was about 11 I heard, ""You need to loose wieght, You're a chubby little boy"" until I was eleven from about the age of 5. Then I just broke, I stood up to them and showed them their flaws. They think they are high and mighty and are the epitemy of perfection. THAT IS BULLSHIT! They will never be perfect. They will never know how to love. THEY ARE COLD HEARTLESS THINGS! GOD!

ON MY BIRTHDAY! I had my Kaitlyn over. I love her. They don't see that. The see us holding eachother, and don't say a word. Then behind my back they are saying things like. ""That is innapropriate"" and shit like that. They don't see the love that radiates off us when we're together. Even tho everyone else does.

Then now, on the week of my 16th birthday, I invited them to come celebrate with me. I gave them one last chance. ONE LAST CHANCE! My cousin came with them to hang out with me because we hav'nt seen each other in about 4 years. For some odd reason, they kept her in the basement and wouldn't let her be in my room so we could talk and hang out. And then she started not wanting to come down but they forced her to anyway, at 10:00 everynight, sometimes 9:00. But she's on vacation, she should be allowed to hang out with her COUSIN! I should have been able to hang out with my COUSIN! Then they made her change her cloths one night for dinner even tho everyone was sitll in their PJs and sweats. They made her change, While she did that, my bitch grandma set the table with the old plates. My mom switched them and my grandma made a big deal about it. That really made my mom mad. NO ONE deserves to be criticized in THEIR OWN HOUSE! So my mom had made a meal and didn't even come down to eat it cause she was so insulted by that IGNORANT hag! Then my Dad stood up for my Mom, and my cousin. My Dad asked why she had to change her cloths even tho everyone was being laid back including them. Her answer was ""CAUSE SHE'S A GIRL!"" <I>WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH</i> <b>ANYTHING?!</b> Total bullshit all week. Then yesterday morning I woke up and laid in my bed for a little while. Then I heard this conversation: (Doris is my bitch grandma). (Mal, is my cousin)
Doris - ""I can't belive you let him and Mallerie stay up in that room all alone.""
Mom - ""WHAT?""
Doris - ""Well all that testosterone. He can't control himself...""
Mom - ""OH MY GOD! What are you saying Doris? My son can't recognise that Mal is his COUSIN?!""
Doris - ""Well they are teenagers and it dosn't matter, They could end up thinking its just a guy and a girl.""
Mom - ""DORIS! DON'T YOU THINK I HAVE RAISED MY BOYS BETTER THAN THAT! DAVID IS A LOT SMARTER THAN THAT! IF YOU THINK THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN THEN YOU ARE SICK!""
Doris - ""Well it happened with my cousins""
Mom - ""WHERE THE HELL DID THEY LIVE? THE BACK WOODS?""
Doris - ""no...""
Mom - ""If you think that David would do that then you don't know him very well.""
Doris - ""....""
Mom - ""THAT IS DISGUSTING! SHE'S LIKE HIS SISTER. THINK ABOUT THAT! YOU ARE BASICALLY SAYING THAT YOUR GRANDSON IS WHITE, TRAILER, BACKWOODS TRASH! WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT IDEA IN YOUR HEAD?!""
Doris - IT HAPPENED WITH MY COUSINS!""
Mom - ""THEN THEY WERE SICK!""

I heard that, I was in my bed listening to how fucking SICK my grandmother REALLY is. I put on my headphones cause I didn't want to hear any more of it! I have 8 words. They need mental help, get a shrink fast! Thruought the entire day I wanted to smack some sence out of that thing. She really seriously thought that my COUSIN and I were going to have sex. We're cousins for crying out loud. Any person with a straight head, and a cousin of the opposite sex feels like there cousin is a brother/sister, and that would just be THE lowest thing anyone could do. GOD! SOME PEOPLE! My mom was right, my grandparents don't know me very well if they thought that was gunna happen. And now they never will know me. I have lost my last little drop of respect for those people. I regret the fact that they are blood relitives. That was the biggest insult I could have EVER recived from ANYONE! Just the thought of that makes me cringe! How do people get like that. SOME ONE! PLEASE TELL ME! Then last night Mal got in my mom's bathtub (Its a jacoozie) with BILLOWING bubbles so all you could see is her face. My mom takes pictures of everyone in our family that gets in there. All you see in those pictures are her face and a shit load of bubbles. After she got out Mal went downstairs and started drying her hair and stuff, and she told those people that my mom took pictures of her in the tub. Then, Like the idiotic people they are, they took it out of proportion thinking that they were nudie pics and that my mom (Who is not like that) was a pedifile and was gunna put them on the internet. My mom is one of the BIGGEST ANTI-PORN PEOPLE EVER! She would never in a millon years and more do anything like that. So Dick (My grandfather who's name befits him) Said to Mal that my mom would put them on the internet. And Mal said that the pictures weren't bad or provocitive at all. And he didn't want to listen and said that the oppinion of a 17 year old didn't matter. So she said ""My oppinon counts just as much as anyone's"" and then Dick looked at her and called her a ""smart ass"". Then she came up in my room after slamming the batroom door in his face and getting done with her hair. She sat on my chair and told me everything that had just happened and then all of a sudden I hear my mom YELL at the top of her lungs. ""GET YOUR BAGS PACKED AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE <b><i>NOW!</b></I>"" and she stared yelling at Dick becuase he came up, pointedhis finger at my mom and said ""I don't appreciate you taking pictures of Mallery in that mannor...""

That was the last straw. Those pictures had NOTHING wrong with them whatsoever. They were my cousin's face with BUBBLES all over the place. ALL YOU CAN SEE IS HER FACE! They were so ignorant they thought they were porno pictures. They never stop to think, about ANYTHING! then they tried to get Mal to come downstairs since they were leaving this morning at 4:00 to catch the train. Mal didn't come down because they were insulting everyone. My Mom told them to go downstairs and stay there, they didn't until my dad told them that he'd get Mal to go down there and go to bed. Then my Dad came in my room and laid on my bed and started talking to me and mal. About ten minuets later Doris comes up in my room questioning mallery. My mom came up behind her and told her to go back downstairs. Doris totaly ignored her, and kept picking on Mal and basicaly saying that this fight was all her fault. Which is totally untrue. For 26 years my mom has held in ALL of the shit that they put her thru and last night just tore her op[en and she lost the binds that helped her hold her toungue. And Doris was blaming it ALL on Mal. Then Dick came up and tried to get her to come to bed. THAT pissed my dad off more than he already was. I have to explain my dad's yell system. Moderaly aggrivated is a small little grrr... kinda thing. MAD is a shout, REALLY MAD is a YELL. Getting pissed is and AGGRIVATED yell. Pissed Is a booming, knock the walls down shout. Really pissed, Is a BOOMING KNOCK DOWN THE HOUSE YELL. TOALY PISSED. Is twice as bad as Really pissed. LOST IT COMPLETELY is something I've never heard yet. But I fear it. Now that you know his yell system I can continue. When Dick came up and started picking on Mal as well, my dad went from calm to Pissed in about a second, and Back to moderatly aggrivated. He said ""mom, dad... GO DOWN <I>STAIRS NOW <b> BEFORE I REALLY GET PISSED!</b> Please </i> thank you."" And they had the look on their faces as if they had been shot or something. And they left.

My ties to them are forever broken. I have absolutly NO respect for those THINGS! They have given our family SHIT for the past 26 years. They have brainwashed my aunt and we have almost lost them because of it. Mal is the only one I want to keep in contact with. I think I can help keep her from being like them. I want to help keep her from being like them. Its sad that they got like that but there is no helping something that has been going downhill ever since those things got married.

They aren't people. Not at all. If they try to contact any of us. They wont, We are cutting ALL ties with them. They are now Dick and Doris to me. As far as I'm concerned... I have only one grandma and no grandfathers. My grandparents on my dad's side... are dead to me. So enough about them.

I need Kaitlyn right now. I miss her. I need someone to talk to in person. She always listens. So do some other people. Kami, Brian tries, Jib. But Kaitlyn will be better for this one. I love her, I never thought I could love like that because I always thought I would be alone cause I always was the one that people came to for relife. I was hardly ever noticed. But now that Kaitlyn is with me... I have less stress, I have someone that I love that loves me back (In a different way than family). She completes me. There was once a hole in me that she fills. The holes that have just been made can go away in time. But then again, they are small ones. I never thought of them as people. I've only said ""I love you"" to them twice, they NEVER have said it back. So I gave up. Now they are gone for good. I just for some reason can't vent here cause it isn't the same. Yeah. This is A journal. But this time it's harder to get off my chest. I need Kaitlyn like I need air. I can't breath without iether one. I need both to stay sane and live. My friends as well. I can't live without my friends. I just would have gone insane a long time ago if it wasn't for them. And if it wasn't for Kaitlyn now. I would have ended up in a loony bit this year. Sometimes things are too much to take. But I need to be here for certain people for certain reasons.

Among the fields of gold
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold
Many years have passed since those summer days

See the children run as the sun goes down

Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cos I'd already know

Just by saying I love you

More than words

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand

"event","Kaitlyn and I went to the dance tonight. It was a whole lot better than the last one. They actually played slow songs. I need to get my disk back! anyway. She and I got there early and talked for a little while. And then J.B. and his girl friend came and we got kinda hyper for about half an hour. then things started to slow down and get comfortable. Kaitlyn and I sat down most of the time because they were playing hip-hop more than anything else(as usual) and then a slow song came on and we had our first dance. One word for it... Wonderful. We sat down again and I put my arm around her while we listend to J.B. tell his jokes. And things just kept getiing better from there. We danced a couple more times and then J.B. and his girlfriend got into a big fight. that was over in about 20 minuets. Then another slow song came on and we got up and danced by where we were sitting. And I saw my friend reproposing to his girlfriend. And then Kaitly and I kissed. (blush). :D tonight was the best night I have had in a long time.

Kaitlyn: @-->---- @-->----- @-->----- @-->----- @-->----- I love you.

"event","My thoughts today are complicated. I am going out with the girl I like, who likes me back, but there's one complication. BRIAN! I dont know who he is anymore. When I first met him he was more laid back and kinda like me. But then he started to change because he liked a girl so much that he converted religions to be closer to her. After that he started to have new ideals on religion. He started getting really uptight and wanted to become perfect for his new self. I was supportive of his decision... Until now. I thought he was my best friend. But best friends DONT treat each other the way he's been treating me lately. Threatening to KILL me dosnt help matters much iether. What really makes me mad is that he thinks he's Mr. Supermormon and that everyone around him should be almighty and PERFECT. Well Brian. I have news for you. NO ONE IS! not even you. Im not saying this behind your back I hope to god you read this. Maby it will make you see how much you've changed for the worse. You were actually a better person BEFORE you converted. You were yourself. Now I dont even know who you are. It's IMPOSSIBLE to read you. I never know what you are thinking. The swearing. I dont ddo it as much as I used to. But if I do it now and then, DONT BITCH AT ME! You arent the person I used to know. Thats what Kami and I were talking about this morning. Thats what I was trying to tell you today. You dont understand that I care and that I am your friend NOT your enemy. No one who we know is the enemy Brian. You've becom your own though. You have pushed me away too long and now I dont feel like you want to be my friend anymore. You and I used to understand each other. Not anymore. and By the way... IM NOT GOING TO CONVERT LIKE YOU! Im sorry if im making you angry, but you have NO idea how you've made me feel in the past couple months.

One thing that everyone needs to understand is that yeah Ill be in a really bad mood for a while. Until my Dad is home safe and maby untill Brain figures out whether he still wants to be my friend. But my Dad is in England right now. The airport he travles thru has been gaurded by tanks, soldiers, and the RAF because of an undisclosed threat to the airport. Im worried for him because of the threats Osama Bin Laden has been making against us, and as well with the pending war on Iraq. If I seem irritated, I probably am. All I ask that is everyone needs to be understanding. Untill my Dad is safely home I will be easily Irritated.

Wars are horrible. Carnage is Horrible. Losing a friend is horrible. Losing a Father, is Devistating.

understand that."

"event","Im seriously thinking about switching schools. Next year I may switch over to the school my brother went to. There are SO many reasons I want to switch. I dont want to leave my friends behind but if it's necisary for my sucess I have to do it. Im tired of falling behind in school and in life. I want to go somewhere NO ONE knows who I am. I want to start fresh and not worry about being someone Im not. I hate myself sometimes. I really do. If I switch I want EVERYONE who is my friend to know that I will always be in contact with them. Im not going to abbandon my old friends. I... I need a change in my life so that my future can be secured. PCHS is not the place for that to happen. Im always worried about what is going to happen every day. Im always worried that someone who has it out for me will do something against me. Im always having someone on my back about something. I have untill the end of this first part of the semester to figure out whether I really want to do this or not. Its another sensitive decision I have to make. I have a past that will follow me everywhere but that past is due to those who dislike me because of who I choose to be friends with or who I choose to piss off. Somethimes I wish I was in solitude only called upon when needed. I still need my friends to ""Hold me when Im here, right me when Im wrong, Hold me when Im scared and love me when Im gone."" And I know that I have friends that care about me enough to do that. I need to make a lot of decisions right now that I dont think Im ready to make, Or should. I just dont know what to do anymore. Inmy mind there are so many things going through it. I feel like Im losing my mind. All of the thoughts and all of the things from my past going through it is ripping it apart. Maby thats why I want to go somewhere new. Maby thats why I dont know what to do anymore. I need a fresh start and a new memory. I wish it was as easy as resetting a computer, Its not, its much, much more complicated. I need something to clear my mind out. My mind is to full to meditate anymore. I have to many thoughts, I cant consentrate. I need to be able to meditate in order to be able to be sane. Its whats kept me sane through everything since 7th grade. My mind is so full I dont sleep anymore. God help me.

feel free to leave comments. Im going to try to sleep tonight."

"event","Boy was today stressful.

my best friends ex-girlfriend and i told each other how we felt about each other, so today i was trying to keep my mouth shut about it to him because everyone knows its a cardinal rule between guys. YOU DONT END UP LIKEING YOUR BEST FRIEND'S EX. Its just not something you do. But apperantly he wanted to try to set us up after they broke up. I had no idea she felt that way about me and we were talking and i looked at her journal entry about a guy she liked and i was just kinda curios to see if i knew him so i asked her. ""Who's the guy your talking abut in your journal?"" 
and she said ""I was hoping no one would ask about that""
""You can tell me i wont tell him.""
""Well if i tell you he'll know""
I got speachless. No idea she felt that way. because i like her too and i didnt say anything because of the rule. So today i was trying my best not to make it look like something happened between us. I thought my friend would kill me but he likes another girl so i didnt know what to do. so everyone tells him i have something to say to him so he thought i was gunna tell him i like the same girl he likes so he was kindof in a bad mood. But when i told him he cheered up. He was planning on getting us together. OI nevous for nothing
he was mad that i didnt tell him earlier tho."

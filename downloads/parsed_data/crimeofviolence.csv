The only word I could think of right now to describe them is ""moody"" or something like ""crazy"". o_o; Ive had moments where I am upset or confused, moments where I am really happy, and somewhere inbetween. But life is always like that, ne? xD<br /><br />So lastnight was fun! I got to go to the mall cause the football game was postponed due to rain. 8D Haha. St00p1d r41n + f00tb4ll. But since the football game was canceled a lot more people when up the mall, like people Ive never seen before that do a million sporty things. xD Thats how it is on Fridays anymore.. The mall is packed. o_o But anyway!<br /><br />I got to wear my new outift! 8D<br />Mother and I went shopping umm. The other day? I forget what day, I think it was Thursday? But we drove like an hour and a half or so away to go to some bigger malls, and I went to a Hot Topic and another local store that moved down there. At Hot Topic I got the cutestttt outfittt. xD It reminds me of a school uniform. It has a white uniform-looking top with an emblem on the left chest pocket, and a red plaid tie, with a matching red plaid skirt, that has a little black belt on it. xD You cant really see the belt when I wear it with the shirt though, but it has a little chain on it and its really cute. So I wore that! :3 And I also threw on my white ripped up stockings and my black and white thigh high stockings. xD With my creepers, of course. I managed to style my hair <em>so</em> adorable. I teased the back and the sides and the top, and it looked all cute and messy in the back. I also put on red and black eyeshadow, which looked awesome, but of course my mom didnt like it much. My bangs are getting long, its hard to see my eyes now. xD But I looked<em> so cute</em>! 8D I love that outfit, im totally going to wear it at the anime convention, lawl.<br />&gt;:3<br /><br />I took Eddie up the mall with me, and we pretty much just walked around the whole time.. Not much else to do. There wasnt many of my friends up there, some random band people, but um.. Tammi was at camp, Christine is grounded, Molly cant go <em>anywhere</em>. Why do some parents just <strong>suck</strong>? :/ A lot of my friend's parents do.<br />But anyway.<br />Rachel managed to get a ride up, and that was cool. :D Me and Eddie hung out with her and walked around and sat on benches. :B We hung out in Waldenbooks for a bit and played air hockey. I forgot how fun air hockey was. xD I TOTARRY WON LOL. &gt;:B<br />Well I dunno actually, the game didnt take score correctly, and I wasnt paying attention. Lol. xD We also got food and sat in Arby's. Eddie wanted to get the cheesecake popper things they have, so I gave him the money for them, and they were interesting. xD<br /><br /><em>But what really was the best part of my night was..</em><br /><strong>FUCKING SAW IV</strong>.<br />Asdjfdlsjflskjfsdlfk'ajlsdkj.<br /><br />I was so excited for the new Saw movie, not just for the movie, but for one monumental thing I found out days ago. The fact that <strong>X got their song in the ending credits</strong>. That is a <em>HUGE</em> deal. Although the song isnt going to be on the Saw IV soundtrack, so I dont think a shitload of people will realize their existence, but I know there will&nbsp;be some.<br />The song itself hasnt been released, although on my myspace I have the song someone took from someone's recording in Japan. xD; Its such an <em>awesome</em> song. I really wish I could have somehow gone to the PV shooting.. So many people in Japan went. I wish I lived in Japan, <em>life would own</em>. D&lt;<br /><br />After 10 years, the fact that X got back together, even if they just have <strong>one</strong> single, thats so amazing to me. I heard that on the single, there will be lots of extra hide unreleased stuff.. Im so excited. I'll want to&nbsp;buy that and probably will online.. Maybe there will be some cool extra stuff you get with it if you preorder or something.</font><font size=""1""><em> I hopeeee sooo. &lt;3<br /></em><br />What also makes me happy is.. They included hide as part of X even though hes not there in body. Im sure hide is smiling down at them and is wishing he could be there in body rocking out. ^__^<br /><br />Haha, oh, and to hear that song, I had to stay for all the credits. xD&nbsp;<br />So me and Eddie were standing there in the isle while I was flipping out so I could hear the whole song, rofl.&nbsp;<br />People must think I have problems. xDD</font><br /><br /><br /></p><em>WE ARE X.</em>"

And not neccessarily in good ways. School keeps me veryyyy busy. Although, I am much more organized this year so its not too crazy. But classes are certainly harder.. Im doing really well though, so its good. ^__^ I want to try to do really well for myself, and to impress my parents, because not to be really selfish, but.. There are lots of things Id like to do and&nbsp;get! xD Lol.<br /><br />A lot of other things have been going on as well, but im really working through them. x_x I think im becoming a better and more mature person, as well.. I can make it, I know it! As long as&nbsp;I stay strong. ^__^ Im trying to be more confident lately, and because I really want to be, I think its working. Even if its little by little.<br /><br />Hmm. What else.&nbsp;<br />Well last week we had a marching band competition, we did<em> really</em> good. I was so happy. Today we have another one, but im not so happy or excited about this one. Theres five other bands besides us, and theyve been in many more competitions and have had a lot more time to get better, while we have only had a week and didnt get a ton done. I think were going to get sixth, maybe fifth, and maybe that comes off as being negative, but I think its more realistic honestly. And im fine with whatever position we will get, its more to me that were <em>in</em> a competition than what place we get.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Holy sheeeeeet</strong>.<br />November is so close. Im so nervous and scared. x_x In a good way, I suppose. Its around 25 days. Only 25. Aughhhh. *rolls around*<br />But.. I do feel more loved lately. All im trying to be is happy. ^__^ And not worry.<br />No more worrying, silly Tsu-chan! Life is being good to you. Happiness is what you should feel.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Pyon pyon</em>~ :3 &lt;3<br />Oooh and I got a new camera! &gt;3&lt;<br />I love love love lovee itttttt~</font><br /></font></p>"

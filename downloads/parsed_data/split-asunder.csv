"event","what is all of this fluffy white stuff?  it's so -cold-!  shia has never seen anything like it before!  it is very fluffy and pretty, but not so good on snakeyscales, no.

and why does it keep flying at my head?"

"event","how long was i sleeping?  i went down to curl around that wide heater pipe -- the one down in the boiler room, you know?  i sleep there all the time; my room isn't nearly warm enough for me.

so anyways, i went to sleep there, and i must have been asleep for a <i>looooong</i> time .. because now there are all of these new people here!  and i am very hungry.

will somebody tell shia what is going on?  &hearts;"

"event","OoC:

WOW parley has gotten huge since i've been gone.  :O  

i'm baaaack!~  ( obviously. )

this is your shia/L/near-mun -- although considering the fact that kt has dropped raito, L will probably be dropped.

for those of you that don't know, shia is my original character; he's not from an anime or manga series.  he's a naga.  much fun snakeyboy.  :}

so, ummm, you can reach me on these AiM names: 

stardust skiies
iess ordinary

i hope to hear from a lot of you, and to get in some good rp, now that parley has gotten ginormous.

- aiden.~"

"event","i never know what to say in these things!  things have been alrighty, although the one friend i made is always distracted, so i've more or less been alone again most of the time; it seems he's got old acquaintances on this ship that he's been seeing lately -- lucky him, i wish i knew some people here.

<strike>.. and what i wouldn't give to have <i>him</i> here with me again.. </strike>"

"event","things have been perking up!  shia has made a new friend from the spiked-haired man -- he is <i>very</i> warm, by the way, so great to wrap around~!

so now that shia has both made a friend, -and- acquired a heat source, i am both happy and healthy!

i hope to meet more nice, friendly people on this ship.~  &hearts;"

"event","something about this place is starting to drain on me.  my coils feel heavy, i'm always cold, and it's hard for me to smile .. shia is usually good at smiling.

i'm lonely, and i miss him.  i miss my rock, i miss forgetting what i did .. this place makes me remember; it keeps bouncing around in my head and i can't get it to go away.  i'm so lonely."

"event","so far things have been pretty uneventful .. and i'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing, but i suppose for now, i'll assume it's good!  i haven't talked to anyone yet -- not in person, at least; only in these little comment thingies.  i'm not so sure that anyone will treat me the same, once they meet shia face to face .. i don't want to frighten anyone.  

i'm starting to get sluggish though .. shia needs a warm place to bask and rest, or shia will not be doing so well soon enough."

"event","shia has made freeiiinndddssss!  quite happy, quite happy.  very nice people have been talking to me, and none of them were afraid of me -- i'm starting to like this place!  i promise that i won't rip these friends apart, shia will be good and not crack their ribcages open, so long as nobody tries to hurt me again.  sometimes i do things that i can't help; people try to make me bad.

there's so much <i>stuff</i> on this place!  so much to see, so many places to curl up and sleeeeep, it's so very nice.  shia is enjoying his 'teddy bear' and might go back to get some more!~ &hearts;"

"event","wooooooowwwww .. so this is one of those .. bloggy things?  hee, blog, that's a funny word .. kind of makes me think of boogers for some reason.  so this thing is pretty much a journal, right?  but i thought journals were supposed to be private little thingies that we write our secrets in?  everyone can read this!  am i still supposed to put me dark secrets up here anyway?

everything here is so confusing, and so .. shiney .. the people without the faces are kind of funny, but they kind of make me feel like i'm home, so they're alright, i like them around.  i haven't really talked with anyone .. they all kind of look at me funny, and everyone here walks on two legs, its so bizarre.  i didn't think i was all that strange .. but here i stand out, i guess. 

i'm kinda hungry.  where do i get foods?"

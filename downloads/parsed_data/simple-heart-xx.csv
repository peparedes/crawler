She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her.
Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect.
He whispers that he loves her,
but she's probably only looking for...</i>

How can you ache and crave for someone's touch 
When you have never felt it? 
I do this for yours, though, 
And the yearning grows more each day 
I have never wanted anything in my life 
As much as I want you 
When you whisper such sweet love 
In my ear when we talk 
You make me melt into a puddle 
Of complete helplessness 
You have become my every waking thought 
And my every dream at night 
I breathe in so hard 
Trying to catch my breath when we can't talk 
I close my eyes so tight 
Hoping when I open them you will be there 
But I know I have to wait 
Until the time is right 
It seems so far away 
That I think I am losing my mind 
I want to breathe in your scent 
And keep it with me all day long 
I want to taste your love for me 
By kissing your sweet lips 
I want to feel your body next to me 
So when you leave for awhile I can hold on 
I just want you to know 
That I really do love you 
When the day comes and we are together 
You will always know and feel this 
I will always hug, kiss and love you 
Every moment of the day and night 
...You will never have another touch unfelt"

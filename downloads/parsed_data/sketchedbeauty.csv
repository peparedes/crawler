"event","<P><lj-cut text=""Daydream believer and a homecoming queen"">&nbsp; <BR>I seriously miss allison. I've been having the time of my life lately. Im finding out that the more I change for the better, the more people dont like me. Theres a boy who doesnt like me just because Im religious. It was weird hearing that, seeing as it was the first time ive ever heard anything like that. <BR>Im waiting in breathless anticipation for sunday, thats when I find out if my special gal gets to live with me. = ) Im excited, if its a no, I will honestly be crushed.<BR>Christmas is coming soon and I cant wait actually..usually I hate christmas but I cant wait for this one...you know?<BR>I dont know whats up with me lately but Ive been crying and puking and Ive just been sad lately. I have no reason to, I just do.<BR>Allison and I have known each other our whole lives and Im glad shes still my friend. In all honesty she makes me rediculously happy.<BR>Someone told me I was beautiful last night and it struck me speechless. I was the most honest thing Ive ever heard, I want to marry this boy. But I cant. Hes been spoken for. Tim is still in texas...I sent out christmas cards last night and wrote my uncle a letter...as gay as it sounds , i like that were pen pals. I mean he lives in alaska, and I get to visit there soon, whos comin with me?!..<BR>I desperately need a new layout, who wants to do it for me.<BR>I saw kristina C. today and everytime i see her, her beauty just ..glows. I ever realised how gorgeous she was till she puller her hair our of her face, her style now does her justice and shes just amazingly pretty. Im kinda jealous I cant pull it off.<BR>I went shopping all weekend and week, Ive spent about 250-500 bucks...somewhere in there.<BR>I want hello kitty stuff for christmas, but there so many hello kitty styles, I like the origninal and the ballerina, I dont likw when she has her bunny friend, thats too japanese for me. =P<BR>I hung out with olivia and that was fun, we talkeda lot. I dont think she likes me tho.<BR>I get to work with hillary all week..</P>
<P>gotta go bye!</P>"

"event","the season premiere of ""always sunny in philadelphia""
is on tonight! hurray! 
see. i have no life. 
i get excited about season premieres and laugh way too hard at things that i'm the only one who seems to think are funny. and dance around in my underwear. and waste my days stalking unattainable people. 
depressing.
but ALAS!!!! i can not sulk. cuz i know i'm just gonna keep on doing it anyway.
save me! :)

now lovers, who had an awful day?
i'll find a way to make you feel better.

i am so sick right now.
on sunday i had to crawl to the living room to my mom, cuz i couldn't stand up.
i had a massive headache, my body was cramping up, i had major chills, and ""oh lucky me"", my throat was swollen. not to mention i had a sunburn.
i'm sure most would agree with me that being sick is a bitch.


ps. since i really don't have any friends on this thing 
i'll give out my myspace.

"event","Yeah, uhh, so I haven't been on here in a while.
but i have some very ironic news to tell.
i went to a metal concert last friday. 
yeah i know. hipocrit right?
i went to see kreator, napalm death, undead, and a perfect murder.
it was totally against my will. i went with my metal head friends louie and hailey.it kinda sucked because the under 21 kids had to stay on the balcony and the 21 and over got to go on the floor. but i guess people got desperate because the people on the balcony started a riot and they started chanting ""let us down, let us down!"" it was fucking hilarious. plus by the time napalm death came on people started moshing. i didn't think anyone would, because besides the fact that we were on a balcony, we were also on stairs. so yeah i bet you could imagine what that was like. i got in multiple mosh pits. in one i tripped on the stairs and this huge dude fell on me. then someone punched me in the spine. next someone's shoulder slammed in to my face, it was awesome. but the sweet thing was that this guy kept helping me up each time i fell. he was pretty hot, if i do say so myself. i think he tried to hit on me when the next band was setting up. but i'm not sure. suprisingly there were alot of punks and skaters there. this one dude had the coolest belt ever in life. ever. it was made of bullets. awwwweeesome. unfortunately there was so much weed and ciggarette smoke i couldn't breathe. if i hadn't been sick that night it wouldn't have bothered me so much. so that was my amazing night as a pretend metal head. i have to say i looked pretty hot that night even if black isn't my favorite color. thank the lord we went to the natural hot springs the next day."

"event","i realize the only metal i really like is pantera and black sabbath.
and they aren't even really hard core metal.
I totally blame my friend louie. she got me hooked.
but don't worry. i haven't subjected myself to the horror that is metal
i just really like the afore mentioned.
sorry metal lovers but it just sounds like a bunch of uneccessary noise put together to ruin my life.
i'll still love you anyway, baby girl.


PS- my sister gave me a new haircut. it looks effing incredible.
maybe thats why i feel like such an arrogant asshole.

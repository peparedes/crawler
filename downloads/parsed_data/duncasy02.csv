One person in our neighborhood's whole screen porch went down and on another house, the screen is leaning to one side. It is really wierd. Oh well. The power came back on today. Which is good. Well i better get going. Later"

 I was so proud yesterday cuz I made a goal with my left foot and I know it dosnt sound like much but I have never made a goal with my left foot so it was really cool. I got an extra point for my team because of that. I want to do it next year.
 The first couple of days went by really slow but then it went really fast all of a sudden. The first day we only got to practice for like 20 mins cuz then it started lightning which isnt cool. 
 Well my legs hurt really bad today. OWCH! We have to go there at 4:30. We are having a water fight but I dont have anything with water in it so oh well.
 I also have to wear something green and yellow. I have some shirts that are yellow but nothing that is green so oh well to that too."

"event","Me and Sara are burning a CD for the cruise. It has songs by hoobastank and new found glory and those kinds of things.
 I was watching MTV yesterday and they had that song by jet. It is called Cold Hard B*****. They didn't edit out any of that. Then they had Don't Tell Me by Avril Lavigue. They edited out ""in my pants"". I found that funny.
 Well anyways. The house has been really boring lately. Like really boring. I need to do something soon and fast. I know that it is impossible to die of boredom, but I think that I might. 
 I was in Yahoo yesterday and this seventh grader was trying to start a fight with me. It was really funny. You should have been there. I was cracking up. All that she ever would say would be your stupid and shut up. That is so funny. Or at least I thought it was. Once this 5th grader girl left she like stopped. It was so gay.
 I still need to get 2 dresses. I have to go shopping. I want to go with Sara. I don't like my sister right now, and I'll give her that she has really good taste. So I don't know. Oh well, I will think of something."

"event","Here are some of my favorite song's lyrics
Don't Tell Me
You held my hand and walked me home I know
While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love 
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl? 
The one who gives it all away

[Chorus:]
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? 
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget 
I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset 
Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl, the one who, throws it all away

Everything
Notice me 
Take my hand 
Why are we 
Strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 

I make believe 
That you are here 
It's the only way 
I see clear 
What have I done 
You seem to move on easy 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
Everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song is my sorry 

At night I pray 
That soon your face 
Will fade away 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 

The Reason
I'm not a perfect person
As many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
Thats why i need you to hear

I've found a resaon for me

To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is You [x4]

I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you

Meant to Live
Fumbling his confidence
And wond'ring why the world has passed him by
Hoping that he's meant for more than arguments
And failed attempts to fly, fly

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

Dreaming about Providence
And whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?



CLICK ABOVE TO VISIT OUR SPONSORS


Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than the wars of our fathers
And everything inside screams for second life

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live
We were meant to live"

"event","Me and Sara talked on the phone for an hour and a half this morning. I am watching Down With Love now. I want to see The Stepford Wives, Garfield, and Anchorman. Our air conditioner broke yesterday so it was so hot in here. They fixed it before night. Then this morning it wasnt working again. This stinks. 
 One day, I want to go to Italy. Then for Christmas, I want to go to New York and see snow again. I havn't seen it in like 10 years, ever since I moved back to Florida. This stinks that Florida dosn't snow.
 You guys need to post comments. You know to give me ideas of what to say. If I don't have ideas to say then I just start rambling, like I am right now. I am going to make this journal entry short though.
 I am so mad at my sister right now. I hate her so bad. She is the meanist person in the whole world. I hate her! She insults me and most of my friends all the time. It makes me so mad. It got to a point last night that I can honestly say that I hate her. Sara knows that I hate her. Some times she is OK. But last night she made me so mad that...I don't know. All that I do know is that I am never going to talk to her again.
 Well I better get going. Bye."

"event","I completely and totally don't think that the MTV Movie Awards were fair. I mean come on. They awarded best dancers or whatever to the guy who was trying to be funny ,who I can't think of his name right now, than to the dance team in the movie You Got Served. I mean they rehearsed and rehearsed. Yet the didn't win. It also said Best team. It had the Bad Boys 2 team, and Pirates of the Carribean team. How did 50 First Dates win? I havn't seen the movie. But still. Pirates is still my favorite movie. Bad Boys 2 is my second favorite movie. How did neither of those win? Well anyways.    
  My mom can't go on the cruise so she is trying to get my bro to come but he dosn't want to go because he dosn't want to take her place. But if he still says no then my sis wants to go. I don't want her to go cuz then she will be insulting me the whole time. Since she will have nothing to do she will want to hang out with me and Sara. You can ask Sara, she knows that my sis will insult me. And if she goes then I will be in a bad mood the whole time. I want the cruise to be fun. My bro won't insult me though. But if I say something to my dad that is rude when I am mad, then he will get mad at me.
  I think it will be a much more enjoyable time if he were to come. I mean me and my sis don't fight to much now but if she was around my friend, then she would start insulting me to be funny. I am not one of those people who can think up something to say really fast. So therefore she just keeps insulting me. And it makes me so mad.
  Plus our air conditioner is broken so it is really hot in here. It is like 82 when it is supposed to be 72. I AM HOT!!!"

"event","My neopets account is not even letting me sign on today. So I can't get on. Well I did the math which is really strange since it is summer vacation, but anyway, only 34-31 more days till the cruise. Which is really cool. I am packing one thing everyday. I made a check list. My sis and I watched bad boys 2 yesterday. It was such a funny movie. I love that movie. Well my best friend can't do anything this week cuz she is at her grand parents. Well she can do stuff, but she can't spend the night or anything. I finished White Oleander, the book, a few days ago. Some parts are really gross though. I started this mythology book and stoped reading it. One because it was kind of boring. And two because I was insulted. It said that for punishment to men, he put women on the Earth. Women are not punishment. I might say this because I am a women. But still. That is so offencive. I don't know how to spell it. Another show that is really good, besides Charmed, is Becker. I love that show! It is about a guy who puts everything down. Some of his insults are so funny. I am going to get a metalic blue base next week. Or I think next week. I am going to have to buy it so I don't really know. I was just thinking that it would be really hard to update your journal if you didn't know how to type. So if you don't know how to type yet then I would go for a typing ellective next year. It helps things out a lot. Once I was typing to three different people at once (I know that that dosn't seem like a lot but give me a break I was like seven) Well I had to tell my sister what to type. I think I was talking to Sara, Hollie, and this kid that I liked that I can't remember his name. But anyways. It really helps. This is a really stupid part of a journal entry. I wanted to get this journal thing that was at Books A Million. You know, to keep my thoughts in. This you can keep your thoughts in but I mean private thoughts. But anyways. It was like twelve dollars so I was like no thanks. The reason why I am typing out numbers is cuz in computer keyboarding I was out most of the time during numbers so I don't really get them that much and it is so much easier just to type them out instead of looking down at the hands (especially since that roller thing that your keyboard is under the dest cuz it is more comfortable that way). By looking down at my hands I would have to roll the keyboard out and then look down. It is such a hassel. Well anyways. Have you ever noticed that when you are trying to be funny your not. Like if you had a laughing contest and you try to act funny, it isn't funny. Well if you ever had a laughing contest with me, I laugh at just about anything. So you can't count that. 
  What really stincks is that I don't have one creative bone in my body (well maybe one, but that is about it) so I have a design template on my journal, so therefore I can't change the face thingy that shows my mood. So it is going to be stuck like that forever I guess. If I got to choose, I would pick Theren's Mouse. They are so cute. 
  I picked live journal because I am a bright person. And since I am a bright person, i prefer live journal more than dead journal. I had this really long thing that I was going to put here but I decided against it.
  If you have a real journal, like the hand written ones, do you ever think that it is wierd that if you don't write for a long time then you say sorry to it. I MEAN IT IS A BOOK! Don't you ever feel wierd apologizing to a book. I had this one journal where I would go back to it at the same time every year. Like I didn't even know it would be the same time of year yet it was. Well every year I would be like (it was always May too the same day too) ""Hey sorry I havn't written in you for exactly a year and all but I am now __ age"" I wrote this really stupid journal entry and I would always be like "" I still think it is stupid to write that in here."" Well since I didn't want the obligation to write in that every year, I sort of, through out the pages. I don't think I should have done that cuz I mean it is a journal, it is fun to look back at the pages and read what you felt. I mean that is what a journal is. You know something to keep track of your thoughts. Right? I was just about to end this journal entry at right but I was skimming through the moods and did you know that there was one that is supposed to be horny? That is so gross."

 I am so excited for the cruise! I wrote out a list of things to bring but I know I am forgetting something. I can's pinpoint what it is though. Oh well!
 A couple of weeks ago, me, my sister, my sister's boyfriend, and my sister's boyfriend's brother all went tubbing. It was so fun! The first time that i went i went with my sister. We flipped off. Kinda. Then I went alone. Twice. Then I went with my sister and the water was rough and then once it got smooth again, the tube flipped over.
 There is this site that I like called neopets and it is really cool, but it only lets me play games. If I try to feed my pets it says that the security setting are enableing me. Same goes for shopping. I looked at the settings and nothing enables it to work. It is gay! Well I have to go. Later"

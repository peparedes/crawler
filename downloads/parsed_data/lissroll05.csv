her new album ""colour the small one"" is great.

"event","I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.  - The Perks of Being a Wallflower"

anyone want to do it? it's on affirmative action. that's all i know.

and it's SO HARD to find information on this topic believe it or not.

i was considering not doing it. then i slipped that to my mom and she flipped...so there goes that idea b/c she's going to be on my ass about it.


last weekend was NYU. 'twas pretty sweet. chags came up saturday after getting lost for like half a day. we got rather shitayy that night, and caused a bit of a rutkus (thats a difficult one to spell), but i had a great time.

i'm suppose to go up to NYU again saturday (or sunday) for the REMMYS which is like this award show thang for jake's program and he's playing his song there w/a live band. so i really wanna go.

you(s) - don't realize i don't like you
you - i miss you - i feel like our friendship is fading away, that scares me because i need you now.
you - you're different. it seems like you don't have time for me anymore.
you - have been amazing this year - and just are amazing. 
you - have hurt me so much this year when you're suppose to be helping me.
you - i am so glad you're out of my life. it's the biggest weight that has been lifted from my shoulders all year and has made me really happy.
you - you're confused about a lot right now - but i'm tired of that being an excuse for everything.
you - where are you?
you - need to leave me alone.
you - suck.


and you (my iPod - yes, i'm doing a YOU about my iPod - shut up) - are the greatest gift i've ever recieved. you have gotten me through this rough semester. our year and a half anniversary just passed and i celebrated by filling you up.

it was entertaining. 

now i'm getting my article for sociology. i'm going to figure out what jobs you can get if you have a sociology degree, and perhaps major in it. 

i doubt i'll do anything w/that degree except open my own bar (which is my main goal), but whatever. 

well, not just a bar, an awesome bar with awesome bands every night and just this cool place to come out and hang. kind of like on the OC where alix worked...except it'll be cooler b/c it's mine. and there won't be any VIP rooms, everyone is VIP, fuck celebrities they can come and hang, but they're not getting special treatment...obviously this goal won't be conquered and i'll probably go broke trying to pursue it, but oh well. it's a dream...and what's any life w/o the pursuit of a dream? (that's from vanilla sky).

anyways, today. 
sociology - awesome.

this week was good times. monday hung out w/the girls. tuesday hung out w/jake and brendan from his play. we watched that new show ""weeds"" and it was good, i thought. then we watched ""breakfast club"" which i'd never seen before -i liked it! 

wednesday...wow. that was an amazing night (<b>which i'll have pictures of up soon on my yahoo site -- if you dont know it ask for it - they're hilarious </b>)

me, siena and ashley were at the track and we decided to go to woodys w/gildea. so we called him up and were like lets go to woodys! 

so we went - we had a mini dance party in the car - w/gildeas amazing mixes (if you didn't know he was gay take a look at the songs on those cds - jesus, every other song is like ABBA and he had the RuPaul covergirl song...it was funny). 

it was so last minute which was why it was so great. so we go there and go in the under 21 room and it's dead. so we go in the boys room - thinking there isn't a girls room - and take pictures at the urinals and stuff - it was funny, like i said - check out the site. 

then, after meeting some various bisexual and homosexual men and women, it got REALLY packed. 

so we started dancing w/gildea and his two guy friends Clay and...shit i forget the other guys name - but he was great too. 

things were getting a little out of hand and sweaty - but it was one of the most fun nights i 've had in a while. 

the thursday morning i went down the shore to avalon w/my mom sister and marissa - it was nice. we went to my mom's friends house w/her kids. 

i ended up having to watch the kids for a lot of the time on the beach and that was annoying at times - but i had a good time overall. 

yesterday afternoon my sister and i went to the wildwood boardwalk and played fasination for 2 hours and spent $40. it was a great time. i won a marilyn purse and we got marissa a bear. 

we bonded a bit - it was nice. 

then i came home and went out w/ash, siena, annie, matt, tim, chris, bergels, brennan, and i think that's it - and we went to watch planes take off - granted our seats weren't the best - but playing good music and being w/good people is what it's all about when your days are numbered as mine are. 

it was a great time.  

i saw brennan's naked ass....that was....interesting to say the LEAST. 

we then went to wendys and that was nice, but it really hurt my jaw which i guess isn't completely healed. 

then i dropped off bergels and had to take klanecks to get his car at matts and we pull up and matt's laying on his lawn so me and klanecki  (after a much deserved ""Matt this is why you're awesome"" comment klanecki made) we layed down w/him and just listened to the summer sounds and the hum of the sexy sati. 

it was a good time. 

but damn, am i going to miss these people. 

today - going to some partays. then hanging out w/my boy b/c i feel i've been neglecting him and i miss his face. 

hope everyone's summer is ending on a great note. i know mine is."

"event","this week has been good. 

i've been hanging out w/people, ya know. whatev. good times. 


jake's shows were really good. he was sooooo good. he song was definietly the best. 

went down the shore friday night w/ash and annie. we hung out and went on the beach till like 3:30am then just hung around until we finally went to bed. 

stayed on the beach all day and ashley and i were the last ones home having spent almost 7 hours on the beach -- beautiful. 

it's getting harder and harder to go down there. i mean my money is tight, the rides are just horrible, i'm tired when i get down there, and most of all - i don't get along w/the guys in the house. 

granted, mark is leaving soon and him and i have never really had ""words"", but sherman and drew i just don't mix well with. 

i also hate their parties. i hate the people who graudated like 2 years ago who show up, i hate the smell of the house in the morning, i hate how people are smoking pot in the room i'm trying to sleep in and all the shit that comes with their stupid parties. 

it may sound like i'm the most straight edge, tight ass person - but i'm really not. 

i can party and get along with people - but the thing is, i did it all senior week and a few weekend in between, and it's like - i'm tired of seeing those same old faces of people i could care less about - the SHS people who have nothing better to do w/their time than to show up at a senior house. 

they're assholes. 

i cant even try and drink and have a good time most of the time because i'm so disgusted by other people's behavior. 

sorry to bitch, it's just really bothersome that to visit my friends i have to be put through this bullshit that i just can't get the hang of. 

i don't think it's me being close minded - i can handle people. i can be polite and know i hate them. that's fine. 

but there's only so much a person can take, that's all i'm saying. 



<b> now that that's done </b>

i found a roommate for west chester. her name is meghan, we met at orientation, she's awesome. 

simply put. 

the year is looking good.

just sad. i was looking at all of the seniors and you look and see all the friends you went through and the phases they were there for, and how that's all over. they're not all going to be there any more. after tomorrow i might never see them ever again. 

it's weird more than anything else. 



oh geez. graduation is going to be harder than expected.

good stuff. 

i got the 2 big theater awards including the medallion one. smix, vice, cecil, chris k and dave all got ones too. that was awesome. 

gildea gave great speeches about us all and made me tear up and dr. kelly stopped him from doing the whole speech b/c they were running over. 


some how i managed to get a leadership pin and citizenship pin - that's hot. 


SHS knows i like the accessories for my cap and gown...holla. 


oh and 50$ for the theater award -- fuckin' right. 

we would have more but we literally have like 2$ in the account.


i am glad that i not only had an amazing senior show to make me realize how important theater was, but to have these awards. they really made the little amount of money from not be able to work, stress, fights, drama in the drama and tears pay off into something indescribable. 

i'm a theater geek and always will be at heart. 


thank you to all of you who touched my life by sharing the same hobby as me and being in the same amazing performances with me. you have all impacted me in one way or another and for that i will always love you."

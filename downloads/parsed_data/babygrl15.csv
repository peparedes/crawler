"event","So I was out on my backporch chain smoking, and coughing up a lung because I smoke all too much, and I had this whole entry planed out in my head. Everything I wanted to say and wanted people to realize... but then I came to a conclusion.

<b>I think I'm going to just dissapear for a bit.</b> No livejournal, no AIM, no myspace (it's being deleted), no cellphone. Nothing. 

I worry about my friends so much even when I feel like they don't worry about me, and lately, I really feel they don't. I always put them first, it's how I've always been. But I need to work on myself a bit, which is the hardest thing for me. I don't even think I know how. I feel like such a waste of space lately and it's not healthy, I know that. I'm so dependent on other people to make me happy, and I can't do that anymore.

I really wish I could just move out for a bit, take time for myself, but god knows that wouldn't happen. Even my mom doesn't trust me right now.

So this is it I guess. This isn't a sympathy plea at all. More a realization for myself. I don't feel like I have much these days and I need to atleast have myself.  So I guess I'll catch you guys when I'm ready to face the world again.

I really hope I can keep this up, we'll see how long it lasts."

Yesterday I woke up in a shitty mood. I was just kind of lonely, lonely for someone, anyone. I feel so distant and just an annoyance lately. It's not enjoyable. I don't even have my two best friends anymore. Allie's compltely infatuated and consumed by Anthony and doesn't even really care to see me, which is dissapointing, and Devon's just weird lately. It's not the same. I don't like it. And without these two people who I know accept me and my lame-ness and really don't care, I feel so desperate and alone.

I ended up going my lover Ben's and met up with Kyla and Hayley and we went to Javas. Mike Moran came, and so did Jacque and her two roomates. They're really nice. They're from Baltimore. I miss Maryland soo effing much, it's ridiculous. 

I cleaned my room last night, it was kind of refreshing. With spring coming, and a change in the weather, it makes me want to change. Once my hair grows more I'll get that cut and dyed and what not, but I really want my monroe pierced times a lot. I don't know.

I will do my work, though. That's crucial, I know. MCC needs to happen next year and this is me taking the initiative. 

I want to playyyy more tonight because I was distracted and happy last night and it was good. I need more nights like last night. Who's in?

Hung out with Ian, Laura, and Mags tonight. It was fun. We met up at Barnes and Noble. We went to the gay section, it was fun. Ian looked uncomfortable. We pressed the doorbell outside and a lady came out, she didn't seem too pleased. Saw Miss. Erin Finton. I miss her.

Then we went back to Laura's. CJ, Ed, and Phil came. We played ass hole and listened to music. I skated around on rollar blades and played on the excersize bike. It was a good time. I want to hang out with them more, they're fun.

But really, spring's coming up, that's the best time to date someone. Lets do it.

Break is over. How upsetting. I need a longer break. Though I can't complain too much about mine. 
I went to four shows over break which was kind of exciting, that's one every other day, though I'm paying the toll with my back hurting like hell.
I'm going to a massage therapist tonight, I desperately need it.

Over break I got to see the wonderful guys that are Four Year Strong, as I said before. We had a big sleep over. Alan was scared in my old creepy house, it was fun. He put on my prom dress from Freshman year, it was stunning. I never stop laughing with those guys. ""Tag your man! Tag your man!"" Eep. I think I'm scared for life.

I went to a show at the Harmony House. It wasn't too bad I suppose. I got to hang out with Ian and Maggie. We made fun of everyone and danced. It was spectacular. Ian's a nice guy.

I saw Jay for the first time since we broke up. I didn't think it would be too awkward since normally he never lets anything be uncomfortable, but it was. Terribly awkward. I hated it. I started to shake.

Marshall and I slow danced at the Fear Before The March Of Flames show during a little intermission. It was romantic. I love him so much. I got to see a good amount of kids over break. I want to continue having fun and seeing them all.

Norma Jean/ Un Earth/ Atreyu this Friday. Hopefully I can pull money out of my ass for this.
Mae/ The Snake The Cross The Crown/ Hot Rod Circuit/ Fire When Ready Saturday. I'm ready to dance.

So who wants to play this week?"

First I must say, <b>I'm so fucking sick of being sick!</b> First brutal sinus infection, walking pneumonia, then the flu which was probably the worst, now bronchitis/ more walking pneumonia/ the worst sinus infection <b>EVER</b>! One right after the other. I blame that completely for my lack of contact with the majority of the world. I apologize greatly.

This weekend I made a trip (despite illness) to Livonia to see Adam, Lee, Brandon, and Ted. Can I say those guys are wonderful? Because they are. I missed them so much. I fucking love Adam and those guys and I wish I saw them more, like before. I went to the show in York and saw <b>Mean Boys</b>. I was seriously impressed. I hung out with the beautiful <i>Marissa</i> too. I adore that girl, she's so much fun. After the show we had a big sleep over with chinese food. It was delicious. Over all I had a splendid time and want to see them again soon.

Other then that it's just been laying low and hanging out with Keith. That makes me tons happy.

Umm yeah. Fuck. I get so sick of updating this shit. I almost posted this huge ""friends only"" entry but then I realized, I don't really care who reads this. They can form whatever opinion they want about me, I really don't care. I have nothing to hide from anyone. Then I got lazy and lost interest and decided not to.

But since I'm in the spirit I'll post pictures for mucks like Brandon and Adam who read/ look at this because they're simply lame.

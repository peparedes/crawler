"event","So, I've had this story idea kicking around in my head for a while now, but I'm having issues getting it to take form into something I can actually start working with.   I've tried writing stories off the cuff before, but they never really went anywhere.  This time I'm trying to actually hash out an actual DIRECTION the story is going to go in, instead of just writing about characters that pop into my head.

The idea I have revolves around the mythological hunter archetype. Similar to the wild hunt, where humans can end up being drawn into the hunt and be changed by it, building off the idea in the Dresden files, where bargains with the fae can sometimes end up with you being in service to them for awhile (and, like with Harry and the Leanansidhe, being turned into a hunting hound).   The protagonist of the story would be someone who made a deal with one of these hunter gods/spirits, and ended up serving them as a hunting hound for an extended period of time (I'm thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of 50-100 years.  Yay for time underhill running differently.)

The protagonist actually enjoyed being part of the hunt, and his master was one of the more kindly hunter spirits out there.   For some reason, however, the Hunter decides to, as the saying goes 'put him out to pasture'.  Retire him from service, give him his human form back, and send him back to the mortal realm.   The protagonist is actually upset about this, and has a LOT of trouble readjusting to society, it has changed so much since he began his service, and again, he enjoyed being part of the hunt, it seemed to be in his blood.

Unknown to him, however, his Master was sending him completely out of service.   Something has been taken.  Something important, that would effect his Master's power base, but which he cannot go after directly with his Hunt.  He cannot act officially.   So he ""retires"" his best hound, and sets things up in such a way to put the protagonist on the hunt to retrieve said item.

That's the extent of what I have figured out for sure.   I'm of half a mind to make the thing that has been stolen be one of the Master's descendants, a changeling.   Perhaps take something from the origin's of Lugh in irish folklore, where Balor was given a prophecy that his grandson would kill him, so he locked his only daughter away to try and prevent it.   Only this in this case, the prophesy is vague enough that it implies supplant him, not kill, and he is trying to take the long view of it, and see if he can't make things turn out in less of a hostile manner. (hell, I might even mention Balor's prophesy when the whole thing is revealed.)  The protagonist (whom I am idly considering naming Gabriel), is actually being 'groomed' to see if he won't make a good match for the master's descendant.

Of course, now I have to work out the details about an antagonist.  Who has taken this person/thing and why.

Anyone still out there reading....any suggestions?  is that whole prophecy/descendant thing too cheesy and over done?"

Since most of the friends I used to communicate with through this medium are now either not speaking to me, or no longer using LJ, I haven't seen as there is much point.   That, and I've pretty much switched to using an old fashioned paper journal, simply because the things I want to write about are often things that I don't want out there for people to see.   Too much fear of repercussions if someone happens to read stuff who isn't already in the know.

Kinda sucks when I think back to how much I used to write in this thing.  Used to be a major outlet for shit that was bothering me, but now it just feels too dangerous to share in such a public forum (I don't even trust the friends only thing, since I know there are indexing systems out there that have, in the past, ripped whole journals and made them public and searchable).

anyone out there still using this and wants to chat though, drop me a line (if you don't already have my gmail addy, just hit me up for it in pm or whatever)"

well today i'm heading back ""home"" after lunch and hear someone call me name.  when i turn around, there she is.  She wanted to say that she was glad i was ok, that she was so worried about me because she knows what kinds of things could have happened to me.  She was crying and everything.

"event","SO, in the last couple days I've started talking to a woman I met on OKCupid again.  It's been a couple years since we chatted at all. Life kinda just happened and we had just started talking at the time to begin with.

Well, turns out she started a mixed media art community at some point.  Curious about artistic stuff as I am, I went and checked it out.  Just for shits and giggles sort of thing.


Well I'll be damned if looking through stuff didn't light a fire under my creativity.  I just HAD to go out to Michael's today to pick up some art supplies, and have spent the afternoon/evening in a kind of half meditation, drawing mandalas.  I've done three of them so far, one given to Sheldon (I don't know why, but it seems like for the past couple years, every time I try my hand at something new art wise, the first attempt always seems to get given to Sheldon.)  and one got given to Megan after Sheldon suggested she'd really appreciate such a thing.

Now I have another one that I just finished.  I believe this one is going to be given to my lovely wife :)

It's funny, I've always been kind of intimidated by mandalas, they seem so complex and that they would require so much planning of the layout.  Thanks to one of the sections of that art community, it gave me a place to start in trying my hand at doing them.  So I'm feeling rather accomplished today.  I got out for a walk and some fresh air, and I did something creative.

I may have to try and make it a personal goal to try to do one mandala, even if just a small one, a day."

"event","Just finished listening to U2's ""angel of harlem"" and a line near the end just grabbed me and got me considering a bit of a concept.  I'm sure its been though of by others, but the words just made me think of it a bit more.

""Angel in Devil's shoes; Salvation in the blues..""

It seems quite common in some circles to label those things dark, seductive, frightening or depressing as, well, to be avoided at best, or as outright evil.

As someone who has lived through some pretty dark experiences (though I'll admit not as dark as some), that line speaks to me rather powerfully.

From those who are christian, they often state that we cannot know ""God's plan"", we cannot know what ""he"" has in store for us.   By that extension, I would think that maybe, just maybe, some of those Devil's they keep renouncing and abjuring, could be the very Angels that would see them through the darkness.  Sometimes to reach the light, you must crawl through the darkness, sometimes you need to be buried in the blues to be lifted up into enlightenment.

The Angel in devil's shoes to guide me in the dark places
Drown me in the blues to make me appreciate every gasping breath of life

Edit: this reminded me of a song written by an author my wife and I are very fond of.  The premise of which is seeing Death not as some evil being to be feared, but the most persistent of suitors.  The final verse of the song is

""Shadow-Lover, from the Shadows made,
Lead me into Shadows once again.
Where you lead I cannot be afraid,
For with you I shall come home again-
In your arms I shall not fear the night.
Shadow-Lover, lead me into light. """

"event","Had an odd dream last night.  I was on some kind of treasure hunt that kept leading me to weird addresses.  Like say, 34 and a three quarters, which would be an access panel in an alley between buildings, or 98 and a half, which would send me down a manhole.  

I don't remember much of the journey, but eventually I got to this dusty old basement that was full of old junk.  I didn't see anything I thought should be the ""treasure"" but I did see what my mind could only imagine was a very mangy and decrepit cat that looked to be as old as dirt, and what appeared to be a large tome until I picked it up to discover it was more of a photo album.

Only, there were no pictures in the album.  Instead, every page was a plain black sheet of paper, with an ornate brass plate in the middle that had a hole for an old skeleton key in the middle.  Every page was like this, and it wasn't like if you kept the book open to the first page and inserted a key, it would go through each ""lock"" at the same time.  The impression I got was that each lock had to be opened separately, and each lock needed a different key.

The frustrating part was that I knew I didn't have any keys on me, and I woke up before having a chance to look around the room for any.

I can see some possible meanings in the dream, and I'm not sure which to go with.  Is this something to do with my creative blocks for photography, or is it something deeper.  Part of me keeps thinking the ""album"" is a record of my past lives, each page a different life that needs to be unlocked and explored on it's own..."

Why is it that some people think that the whole world should hold to what THEY think is appropriate.

On a forum I frequent, some young woman was going on and on about how creepy it is for a guy old enough to be her grampa was hitting on her.  Asking how these men could possibly consider it appropriate for a 60+ year old to hit on a 20 something year old.

Yeah, if it were against the law to creep ANYONE out, there would be a huge overpopulation problem in prisons.

Think of the things in history that people have deemed inappropriate.  Women or certain ethnic groups voting.  Women working.  Women wearing pants.  homosexual relationships.  socks with sandals (lol!).

the world turns, and mindsets change. 

It always annoys me when people refuse to look past their own feelings to see the way the world works."

If you would prefer to either hear, or not hear, about certain aspects of where my sex life is going these days, please let me know.  The posts are not going to be graphic or anything, but since I am exploring certain areas of the kink scene, I'm sure some people on my friends list won't want to hear about it.

Hell, I'm not even sure who even pays attention to my livejournal anymore.  if I don't hear from you, I'll assume you want to be filtered out."

"event","Wow, I just realized how long it's been since I made anything other than a cursory post here.

I've had a serious case of the blahs for the last few months, and it's made it kinda hard to really get my mind to focus on much.  The biggest project I've accomplished was that drawing of Yggdrasil that I posted on Deviantart recently.

I guess I'm just a bit depressed.  On top of the usual season crap right now, I'm combating the realization that I really need to find a job soon because Ally's EI runs out this month.  I had been hoping i might be able to look into going back to school with E.I. footing the bill, but ally's only getting minimal hours at her job right now (like maybe 8 hours a week), and its really tough to survive on that and my E.I. (especially if I want to be able to go see Carey again anytime soon) So I think I'm going to end up having to put my name in at a couple of the other call centers around town and hope its not as bad as working at Arvato.  

My age is starting to hit me when it comes to the rapid weather shifts we're having this year.  I'm not going through a single week without feeling some kind of aching in my joints.  Damned arthritis.

On top of that, I have had four attacks of severe abdominal pain in the last month or so that lasted for hours.  The second last one, I finally broke down and went to the emergency room at 3am (Boxing day at that).  An old and very good friend of mine was kind enough to drag himself out to drive me to the hospital and sat with me all night while I was waiting to be checked out.  FINALLY, 10 hours,  a blood test, a urine test, and an ultrasound later, I find out I have multiple, mobile gallstones.  I'm currently in a holding pattern waiting to be contacted by a surgeon in regards to what the options are regarding it.  In the meantime, I have a prescription for Percocets (which I have to admit, REALLY took care of the pain for the last one I had, allowing me to enjoy new years, instead of being in severe pain.

The only issue now though is looking at the advised foods to avoid to prevent an attack.  The list is just jammed packed full of all my comfort foods :(  So everytime I want a treat, I look at whats available and instead of getting that comfort, I get ""you can't have this if you want to avoid pain"" thought process.  it's enough to make a full grown man cry I tell you!

THEY EVEN RECOMMEND AVOIDING CHOCOLATE! *weeps*

We also had to put one of our cats down like 3 days before Christmas.  He had a tumor on his lower jaw that was making it so he could no longer eat.  There wasn't much choice in the matter, but it was still extremely hard to say goodbye.

I haven't done a photoshoot in probably a good year or more.  I keep wanting to, I talk to potential models, but something either comes up around the date planned for the shoot, or I just can't get ambition up to actually schedule something.  It's sad because I have kinda been wanting to experiment with some genre's of photography that I haven't really done.  I really do need to sit down and force myself to do a couple of shoots, maybe the creative work will help pull me out of my slump.

On the flip side of the coin though, I have helped a friends significant other, a very wonderful woman who has just graduated from university with a library sciences degree, move into the building.  She's a fascinating woman I've been wanting to get to know better for quite some time, and her living in the building, and not only here visiting Peter on the weekends will make that a lot easier.  The prospects of forming another good friendship is always great.

anyway.  Enough of my emoness.   I think I'm gonna go see if I can hunt up some PVP on eve."

I don't think I have ever, in my life, been referred to as gorgeous.     The woman is a bit old for my tastes, and lives way to far away (Arizona, sorry, one LDR is enough for me thanks).  But it's still a first for me :)"

"event","so... we're back from the kraut-land...not much has changed. the trip was really good, hamburg was nice and cool and german, but the place we liked the most was hannover, it feels a little more like home to us than hamburg. the world cup games we saw were very good, we like mexicans, angolans, equadorans,and costa ricans...oh yea and after our flight home, we arrived to find the yo-yo that we ordered bfore we left was there, and that made us happy so toodles for now

-p.s. we still have our amazing yo-yo'ing skillz, we'll show you sometime ::chip::"

"event","oh man... after an extremely swole night of hardcore gaming, playing Guilty Gear Izuka *fighting game*
 and Rez *trippy/music/shooter/robotic/computer/action* wikipedia it if yall get the chance, we went to bed at 6 and then woke up at ten, only to eat a fat cheese burger and an orange pop and lay on our ass, which is currently whats happening now *10:16am*, we are also daydreaming about all of the people we have crushes on, because we have crushes on any female that touches us we are always suseptible to being suckered into doing things that women like, ex.(massages) but we guess its alright, because we likes's touching guyls...hhhmm what else oh yea, about us having a crush on like all women, we dont want to really say names, but even when i get over gurls they can do things to make me like them again. ex.(IB bbq) nuf said, on top of that, we like the gurls that we have already established relationships with as really good friends, but thats part of why we stay friends with them ::shrug:: on another note, nikki if you know how to do a tea ceremony you have to teach us generically, or just give us a brief explanation of what they do during one....uh we're gonna get back into yo-yo'ing cuz most of yall didnt know but we're actually a really good yo-yo'ers... back to gaming, not all entries have to be bad

"event","excuse us if we write phonetically but we have a lot to say, we recently had a convorsation with our ex-girlfriend, whom we are good friends with now, but that is not the point. we were chatting with her for a while over people and the topic of bad things came up and we started talking about how we've seen bad things happen to lots of people and we eventually got to the point where we were telling her about bad things that we had done to people in the past. and most recently/the last bad thing we did to someone was to one of our best friends caitlyn, where we were talking about jesus-knows-whut and she said something really sassy that we did not like, and on top of that when we questioned her about it she gave more sass...so, we threatened her and she said that she wasnt afraid of us or what we could do, but lil did she know that we were already plotting against her to get her ex-bf to talk to her and say something nasty to her, which *at the time* was the last thing she wanted to hear. so, we'll spare you all of those details, but it turns out that she was just joking the whole time with us, and we didnt even know it, so then we felt really bad and apologozed a lot for it, *back to the real point* ex-gf thought that it was mean but glad that we apologized, but out of confusion and spur of the moment we decided to think aloud about other bad things we had done, and wouldnt you know it, we had done something bad to the ex-gf and hinted to it while thinking out loud *not good for us* and she picked up on it and us felt so stupid for that, because we knew that telling her would be the end of our friendship with her, so we decided not to tell her, but we thought about telling her, but then became undecided as whethor or not to tell her, because, we like telling the truth *lie* but guess who we call for all of our problems *caitlyn cuz she tha best* and we told her the situation, and shes all like ""well...what did you do to her"" and we were like ""we broke up with her for a different reason than what we've been telling *for the past yr.5* and then she was like ""what was the reason"" and we were like ""well...we said that it was because of an arguement that we had, but really it was because we werent feeling the same about her, feelings had changed at the time, and wasnt really ready to  go on with a relationship at the time *heres the bad part* but then the argument came up, and gave us a scapegoat for the breakup, along with being able to place the blame on her for the break up when she still loves me more than life itself to this day, and thinks that although we broke up with her, its her fault and she still feels guilty for it"" and then caitlyns all like ""yea dont tell her that"" and we were like yea thats what we thought, cuz then her and us would not be friends anymore. and we wouldnt like that very much because she loves us so much that shes offering herself to us.... *take from it what you will* but no worries mate *we's still virgins* but...*tick tock* ANYWAY the verdict was we no told her, and she does not know to this day, anyone who want to tune this journal out *cuz its gonna be real bad prolly*  can do so now, because all of what we say will be true, because no matter what we say, the keyboard always pwns us so we have to at least type the truth. ppl of the LJ dont hate us for who we are, and we cant promise that i havent already wronged you who read this, so if you the reader want to tune in every 3to4 *srry bout the wait* youll get a face full, srry again to tell yall about us but even the darkness has to reveal itself sometime... 

pieace till nextime -chip-
p.s. please dont tell anyone abouthis journal, because we will never post on private, so if you read it you do but dont spread it *thanx*
p.ss dont fudge with ppls lives, its not good if youre not us"

"event","my LJ cherry has been popped for reall this time guys, i will post on this at least every 3 days, and ill start now,... i am a hopeless romantic, for all those who think chivalry is dead.....it is but i am still a gentleman.\\

any way, recently i have been in love, and although sometimes it feels good, sometimes it feels really bad too, like realizing that the girl you've loved you whole life might not feel the same way, or that one of your best friends night just want to stay best friends.

ill keep you posted and also tell you about who i really am and how i think, because a lot of ppl know me, but couldnt tell you much about me, ::its the way i am:: so maybe if ppl decide to listen they might just get an epic"

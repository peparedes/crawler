"event","um yah so it's been a few months. good times, il ike making you wait for my updates, kris, porsh, nick and riese. since those are the only ones who read this anyways. and it's not like anyone else updates. right


school is awesome. me and riese live in buildings across from each other, so we hang out a lot still. not as much as in high school, but we do make a point to go out every weekend and i ride while he skates. it's good that we're branching out though, we still have each other but we have other friends too and that's good. but what stinks is that i'm in richmond and porsh is all the way down in newport news so i don't get to see her often. she passed through on her way home, so i got to spend a day with her...and when spring comes, i'll probably go down and visit her and we'll go to the beach or something. i miss her a lot. before going away to school i thought we'd see each other more often since we both took our cars to school but it didn't work out that way. but it's sorta fine because i did just see her for thanksgiving break and in 2 weeks, i'll get to see her for a month over winter break..she's leaving cnu before i leave, so she's stopping by for a little while. that'll be good.


oh yeah, bbq night with kris over winter break. we decided to have one over winter break and one over spring break. probably end of summer break too. just to keep in touch more, because a lot of people are kindof leaving the group and i dont want to just lose touch with kris because she's one of my best friends. but we were thinking of instead of having our bbq night in the summer, of having a big bbq with everyone right before we leave for school again. sooooooo more info on that as summer starts.



good news! i used to have a stalker but not anymore! liyan helped me with that one without even knowing she was doing it. so big up for friends."

"event","yesterday night was bbq night and me and kris had a grand time, just like every year. bbq night is something to look forward to, because no matter how much we change as people, we know this night will always be the same. that's what i like the most about it. in a time where people are all over the map, this will always happen, it's something to look towards because it will always be there. 
well i just said the same thing a couple times. oh well
kris came over around 730 after she MADE SURE her vcr was set to tape gilmore girls because she's obsessed, and she brought the hotdogs. i was already out back getting the grill out and the burgers, then i started grilling as kris got the tv out and set it up. then we started movie number one as the food was cooking. we watched fight club and the lizzie mcguire movie. 
my mom set up the canopy that we use when we go camping on the deck so that the cicadas wouldn't be all up in our grill and shit, so that was cool. we felt like nerds though, on my deck which is a raised deck, and we had this tent thing. but it was cool. 
all in all, bbq night was awesome. except for that part where i got a phone call from a crazy ass who didn't get it the first time when i told her that she couldn't come to bbq night. she called me again, so i turned off my cell and told my mom not to answer her phone calls if she called the house, but she didnt. man, i love it when people just don't get it. best ever."

"event","tonight is bbq night with kris. if you don't know what that is, it's when me and kris grill burgers and hot dogs outside on my deck, then we bring out the portable tv/vcr and watch a movie outside while we eat. kris and me have been doing it for the past 6 years that we've known each other and it's always been just a sean and kris thing, and now people want in on it. i love portia, but i told her she couldn't come because it's always been just me and kris, so if anyone thinks i'm going to be cool with them coming, they are wrong. because i told no to my GIRLFRIEND. if anyone else were to join us, it would be porsh and nick. not some random ass who reads my away message that says ""getting ready for bbq night with kris"" and asks ""BBQ night! whoa! where's the party at tonight?!"" yeah right, like i'm going to invite you. NO."

"event","-haven't had time to just ride like i used to. school's kicking my ass right now and i'd like to keep my college acceptance so i'm trying real hard to not fail. but riese has been skating a lot and he's found some nice spots for me to check out probably this weekend when there's a lull.

-missed porsh at school today. she didn't come in so she could spend the whole day working. i'm thinking of doing something like that later on, just going into work instead of school..making a lot of extra cash for doing nothing. right on. 

-i'm about to head out to visit porsh right now actually. kris and riese have been there almost the entire day and i just got back from school and i don't have hw, so thats what i'm doing."

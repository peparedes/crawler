"event","I don't understand my sleep schedule lately. I'm always so bloody tired in the mornings, and yet as soon as it hits 10pm i'm wide awake. Stupid sleepless cycle. I keep trying to convince myslef to go to the gym after dinner to wear myself out before bed, but it hasn't happened yet. 

To do this weekend:
Look at SW apartment (i don't know if i can afford it, but i might as well check it out.)
price check fabric (i saw this super cute purse at target yesterday and thought ""i could make that!"")
find my old comcast modem (before they charge me $90 for it. i didn't know they needed it back!)
Job hunt (I don't want to, but it couldn't hurt to wander about and drop of resumes)
Buy max pass
pay back mom"

"event","I actually applied for secondary jobs last night. I really want to go be a bartender, i just don't want to have to pay my dues for a year or two before i'm actually behind a bar. I'm not sure what to do about that. And then i have Jame's voice in the back of my mind telling me how hard it is to get a resturant job and that i could never do it. Stupid boy making me feel less self confident than i should. Ps. is't a serving food not brain surgry. Just becuase he was an asshole who had a hard time keeping a job doesn't mean i am. 

Any ideas of where i should go look first? I hate dropping off resumes, but that's my plan before i head off to seattle to party this weekend."

"event","So sleepy. I got home way late after Collin's coffee shop show. It was great fun, hanging out with the girls, we didn't stop laughing for at least 2 hours. I love friends that you can just get together and laugh. Plus, we just met Stephanie that night and she fit in like we'd all been friends for years. Seeing Collin was fun, i love seeing kids from high school all grown up. Yay for MySpace keeping us all connected.

I think i've found a place to live, it's a big ole' basement in a couples house. The husband was cute and fix-it-y. I'm looking at a studio wednesday and then i'll make a descion. The basement is 2 rooms plus a bathroom, but no closet. Perhaps the studio will be giant, but i doubt it."

Timber Press went from an internship, to an internship and a part time job and now it's a full time job plus some fun paid intern projects to keep me occupied. I'm v. impressed and already planning to move. 

I saw one house and met the potential roomates and i'm thinking of taking it. They seem like great guys, the house is super cute, and i can move like right now. I might have to kill my father if i stay at my house any longer. And the boys already have one cat, and dont' mind two more, that's really fucking hard to find. If i had to do it over again i might not get kitties, but i love them soo much. Now my only delima is to decide if i want to bring my couches into a house with a clawed kitty. If my couches get shredded i would cry and cry. 

Last night was super fun drunken-ness at Claire's house. we had a few surprise guests, made psychodelic cup cakes and just talked. I love small gatherings where you can just chat."

I'm working at finding an apartment, now that the job situation is solidified. I've given in and decided that perhaps i can live with a boy, and responding to adds that are m/f mixed.

Mirrors

	Nicole dumped the bag onto the glass. It was the summer after we had graduated high school and we were pretending to be rock stars. Our high school had been more focused on the arts than the academics, we were constantly finding ways to expand our minds and look beyond the normal to create our art. The visual arts department was stoned at all times. Nicole and I were theatre kids, it was hard to smoke and then go on stage, although drunk, on the other hand, was incredibly useful for improv. We hadn't gone to class drunk but no one would have noticed. It was a good thing we hadn't discovered this particular vice that shone on the table until after school was over. We were no longer worried about expanding our minds; we wanted to fuck it up until we no longer cared about connections and deeper meanings. All that really mattered was what was going on with the chemicals in our bodies. 
	The clumps of drugs lay sparkling on the glass. We were using the insert of a picture frame. Hollywood always uses mirrors in movies but in reality, looking up your own nose while snorting is disconcerting. Nicole smashed the blow with a dollar bill and a bic. Neither of us smoked yet both had bics hidden away in our purses for the sole purpose of supplying a light for a hot smoker at a party. That entire summer was spent at parties looking for hot smokers; hopefully with tattoos. Nicole always let me chop, I could chop blow forever, breaking the clumps into a fine powder that wouldn't burn as much as chunky coke did. I didn't chop forever though, this was the first of the day and neither of us wanted to wait. The lines I pushed across the glass couldn't be called mere lines, they were rails. I hadn't been able to breathe properly through my nose in a while, I was getting used to the mix of decongestants and mouth breathing. 
	We left Nicole's mom's house, grinning foolishly and noses running. Walking into sunshine, dark sunglasses protecting dilated pupils. We were heading out to a friend of a friends house. We had met while driving around the one main street in our town. We would cruise down McGillvary ending at the Wendy's parking lot where I would try to get the souped up cars to drag race my stock Subaru. We usually met other summer breakers and would end up at some party. The last party we had attended through Ryan 4, so named because he was the fourth Ryan of the summer that one of us had slept with. Sex was another kind of chemical to subject our bodies to. Ryan 4 was one of the few people we talked to again after the sexual relation occurred. I can't remember if I slept with him or if it was Nicole, it's possible we both did. He had ended up at a friend's house the night before and we were on our way to rescue him and possibly find a party for the coming evening. 
	Arriving at the friend's house we were surprised that one of the house mates was below the age of two. This was a house where I was afraid to take my shoes off, the baby who was too young to speak or voice any fear of germs was crawling on the floor in front of a gory Insane Clown Posse poster. Empty bottles of Fanta, an obscure soda, decorated the top of the television as a few half dressed people sprawled on the couch playing video games. 
	""Get the fuck out of my way!"" One guy in boxers and socks yelled at the television as we walked in. 
	Nicole sniffed quickly, ""hey. Is Ryan here?""
	""You dickhead just fucking killed me,"" another guy in a sidewise cap and mesh sports jersey threw an empty coke bottle at the first player. He glanced quickly at us, ""he's taking a shit. He'll be out in a sec.""
	The coke bottle had landed near the baby, who picked it up and started sucking on the plastic cap while looking wide eyed at the new comers. I smiled cheesily at him, covering my face with my hands and 'peek-a-booing'. I left the talking up to Nicole, ""cool,"" she said to the guys and we perched on the couch to watch the video gaming. I covertly made cutesy faces to make the baby laugh. I left most of the talking up to Nicole while we were in public. My favorite time at parties was when it was late and I could rest my head in her lap as she pet my hair and had conversations above me. I've never felt saver than lying on the floor with my head between the protective hollow of her criss-crossed legs. It would have looked strange to lie on this stranger's couch with my head in my friend's lap, so I didn't. I wondered who actually lived in this house but had stopped asking around the beginning of the summer, after a string of strangers houses. It became too pointless to try to figure out who's house we were in, I was usually too wasted to remember much about it the next morning anyway. 
	Ryan 4 peaked through a door opposite of our spot on the couch. He didn't wave but tilted his chin up with a jerk as a way saying hello. We used our hands to wave back at him. There was a girl I hadn't seen before in the kitchen with him, the baby on the floor belonged to her. Ryan didn't introduce us, I wondered if he was sleeping with her too, although he hadn't introduced us to the guys on the couch and I doubted that he was fucking them. The tv was too loud to hear the two in the kitchen yet the girl looked nervously at us. Ryan pulled a razor blade out of the kitchen drawer and the girl glared at him for his lack of being discrete. I pretended I didn't see. The boys on the couch were just as indiscrete; they paused the game and wandered to the back of the house. We were very obviously not invited. Left alone on the couch the baby still on the floor. My heart raced uncomfortably and I sniffled loudly and tasted bitterness at the back of my throat. The baby looked at us with silent and glassy eyes. I felt far less glamorous than a rock star. I could hear Nicole's labored breathing next to me as her lungs pumped just a little too fast. I thought about taking the coke bottle from the little guy but I didn't see any other toys to give him. 
	We dropped Ryan off a while later at where ever it was he was going. He was sniffing and snorting just as bad as we were. After that day, blow stung a little more when we sucked it up through a straw. My thoughts moved painfully through my head and the lack of sleep began to catch up with me. The amount of money we were spending was catching up with us and I was leaving for college in just a few weeks. There wasn't a conscious move to stop but by the end of summer we were back to smoking pot and gazing at the night sky expanding our minds. I still wonder about that baby, he'd be about six now, perhaps he's out grown the rock star life style.

She stood by the toilet, fully clothed, while she turned on the shower. She was still wearing the clothes from last night, most of them. They were sticky against her skin and pulsated with the beat of the veins in her head. Her body was reacting to the alcohol from the night before, it was the cause of the throbbing headache. Heather sneezed, another leftover reaction to the smoky rooms last night. 

The party the night before had been large, not as crowded as the one last weekend, but at this one people could smoke inside the house.  She wondered who lived at this house as Sarah lit up a cigarette next to her. They had moved away from the open door, the night was chilly and the inside of the house was still warm and inviting. They stood next to the fireplace in the living room, and scanned the crowd. 

""Anyone?"" Heather didn't have to look at her friend. 

""No."" Sarah exhaled the word with a cloud of smoke. Heather didn't smoke herself, but was surrounded by it enough that the smell had become comforting. She didn't bother to wave it away as her friend's tendrils of exhalation drifted into her face. 
	Heather's bare shoulder leaned against the rough stone of the fireplace. She shivered against the cold stone, but her pose of casual leaning was a practiced one. She ignored the groove in her shoulder she knew the stone was making and felt her nipples come to attention with the cold. She watched as a tall boy came through a doorway across the room. He was balancing a full keg cup and looked up long enough to make eye contact with her. She barely changed her facial expression, and watched his eyes slide down to notice how the cold affected her body. She allowed herself to smile, but broke eye contact.
	""Drink?"" Heather asked. 
	Sarah had spotted a friend and was waving her over. ""Let's share one,"" she spoke to Heather and handed her $5. Heather in turn passed Sarah her sweatshirt, wrapped around an old water bottle now filled with their own mixed drink. Sarah took a large gulp as Heather headed for the kitchen. 
Glancing at the bathroom mirror, Heather's hair stood on end and her heavy eye make up from the night before had smudged and smeared. What was left around her eyes left her looking beaten and bruised. The only noise in the apartment was the shower beating water against the floor, filling the room with steam. Sneaking a glance at the mirror, her reflection had become distorted. Her blackened eyes became haloed by the steam, only to disappear completely; all that was left were splotches of color. The steam began to strangle her beneath her sticky clothes. As she shed them, the comfort of the heat and steam in the empty house kept her from feeling exposed. 
Her high school sweatshirt went first, with the name of every student in her small graduating class on the back. Her socks, bra and panties still in the kangaroo pocket. 

She pretended not to notice the lump in the pocket and threw the whole package in the corner. Tank top and pants followed, her belt slapping angrily against the floor. The noise made her jump; the quickened heart rate sent a new throb of pain to her aching head. 
Ignoring the pulse against her brain, she bent over the shower to adjust the temperature one last time. Her breasts swung heavy in front of her; she imagined she could feel her belly swinging in the same fashion. You will never find a boy who can love you looking like that! Her father's words echoed in her head. Heather had been furious when he had said that, ruining her excitement for going off to college just a few months prior. His offensive comment had resulted in him buying her a gym membership and a new wardrobe. Heather had joked to her friends that ""nothing says I'm sorry like throwing money at it!"" She turned the temperature up again before straightening up and stepping into the tub. 

It was hot. She eased her knees into the spray, folding her arms in front of her to protect breasts and belly from the heat. Refusing to adjust the taps cooler, she moved her head underneath the water. The water slowly worked its way through her hair and onto her scalp. She sighed with relief; it was too hot for her head to ache. The water released the smell of last night into the bathroom. Cigarette smoke filled her nose and made her eyes water. The brand Craig was smoking last night was more pungent then the smoke she was used to. She wasn't going to think about Craig. 
Turning around she let the spray run down her back, loosening her hair she half heartedly combed at it with her fingers. She was fully aware that the giant snarl at the back of her head would need more work.  She poured shampoo onto her palm.  Craig's cigarettes began to fade with the smell of perfume and soap. She'd met him last night, still wondered what brand it had been that had smelled so foul in her hair. She didn't know his last name. 

As she had walked to the kitchen to buy the keg beer to share with Sarah, she purposefully passed the tall boy. His shirt was light and matched his blue eyes; the material was thin enough that when Heather brushed her chest against his back he could feel how cold the fireplace had made her. 

""Oh, sorry,"" she was not sorry at all. 

""It's ok,"" he tried to make eye contact but she had already moved to the kitchen. She could feel his eyes on her back. 

As she rinsed the shampoo from her hair, she became aware of the odor of sweat, hers intermingled with his. Her sweat she didn't mind. The other she pretended not to notice. She dumped too much conditioner onto her palm and worked it into the mat of her hair. The mat created by friction of her head against a pillow. The conditioner loosened it enough that she could pile it out of the way on top of her head. 

Mixed with the smell of foreign sweat was foreign cologne. When she had first smelled it last night, it had smelled good, clean. As she had come out of the kitchen he had stopped her. He stood slightly behind her. His breath warm on her ear, one hand came from his side and ran from between her shoulder blades, sliding down her spine coming to rest above the curve of her backside. 

""What's your name?""

""Heather."" She turned, careful of her full cup. 

""I'm Craig."" His hand had slid around her as she turned and ended resting on her hip.
 
""Nice to meet you, Craig,"" she leaned toward him slightly, ""I love your cologne."" She turned around again, allowing his hand to circle the rest of the way around her hips, flattening her stomach so all he could feel was hip bones. 

He leaned in against her back, his mouth once again by her ear, ""I love your perfume. You are the prettiest girl in room.""

She hid her blush by keeping her face forward, ""Thank you, Craig."" She left him then and returned to Sarah across the room. 

Pouring soap onto her sponge puff she scrubbed as far as she could down her back.  The soap began to foam, and she coated her body with it. She avoided one area; it was still sore from the night before. The rest of her body she scrubbed until she turned red beneath the foam. The smells were gone, covered with the thickly perfumed foam, and then rinsed away. Her skin was left feeling squeaky clean, like glass. 

Sarah and her friends were laughing when Heather returned. She handed Sarah the cup and Sarah passed back the sweatshirt. Unscrewing the cap she drank from the strong rum and coke within. Craig was still watching her from across the room; Heather pretended to be deeply involved in the conversation. She didn't know any of the girls, although she suspected she had met them many times at parties similar to this one. Heather smiled and laughed when the other girls did, not paying attention to what anyone was saying. She adjusted her hair, taking one curl into her face, and then glanced quickly through it at Craig. She couldn't resist smiling at him, timing it with the laughter of the group of girls she was surrounded by. 

Craig began to make his way across the room, stopping to say hello to various friends along the way. Heather managed to focus on the conversation long enough to insert a comment or two. Just enough that the other girls still knew that she was there and in the group as well. She paid enough attention to know where the conversation was headed yet she was watching Craig's progress across the room. She looked at the other girls, prettiest girl in the room, she thought. She didn't believe him, but she wanted it to be true. 

He touched her elbow gently when he reached the gaggle of girls. They didn't even react as he leaned toward her, ""Come with me?"" Heather glanced at Sarah; she was busy retelling a story. Heather nodded and followed Craig around the fireplace and up the stairs. 
Picking up her shaving cream, she stepped far enough away from the stream of water to lather up her first leg. The faint stubble that had grown since the day before tickled her palms as she worked up the foam. She was sure Craig hadn't noticed. He had slid right past her legs to the place that she had avoided with her sponge puff. She hadn't been ready for that, her shirt was tangled about her shoulder and his socks were still on. The party could be heard on the other side of the door; she could hear conversations as people walked past. She wondered if it was locked, but didn't feel like asking. Picking up her razor from the side of the tub, she took a deep breath before touching the cold blades to her skin. She was disappointed, she liked her legs, and it was too bad they had been completely ignored. She slowly glided the razor from her ankle up her calf to her knee. She watched the clean trail of skin revealed beneath the layer of foam. She repositioned the razor, and cleaned another trail from ankle to knee, slowly rotating around her own leg. She enjoyed the feeling of her own naked skin against her hand as she rinsed the remains of shaving cream from her legs, then rubbed the newly naked one against the still prickly one. 

In between legs she finally got the nerve to take a hand full of clean water and rinse that one last area of her self. She felt lopsided, standing with unbalanced legs, but she couldn't stand Craig being on her anymore. He led her to an upstairs bedroom, his hands falling to the waist of her pants. He pulled her close for their first kiss, hands busy at the button of her jeans. His knuckles brushed her and she automatically pulled her body as far from his hands as she could without moving. The pants were a pair her father had bought her to help her hide herself in tailored clothes with distracting patters. 
As he pulled her toward the bed she considered backing out. Sarah was downstairs, but wouldn't miss her. Sarah was used to her disappearing into other peoples rooms and had been completely distracted by her other friends. Sarah wouldn't even notice she was gone until she needed a ride home. Craig wanted her there; he had complimented her and brought her up there. 

""Tell me again, how much do you want me?"" Heather didn't want to have to ask for the compliment.  

Craig rose up on one arm to look at her. He brushed the purposeful curl out of her eyes. Taking one of her hands in his he brought it down to the opening in his pants. Heather took a moment to wonder when his pants had become undone, before realizing the destination of his touch. ""That's how much I want you."" He smiled at her, waiting for her to laugh. Heather giggled uncomfortably and Craig's smile faltered. ""Sorry,"" he said, ""you were really the most beautiful girl downstairs. I don't know how to say that with out sounding retarded.""

His eyes were so blue in the dim light and so hopeful that she would understand him. His hand was still on her curl, almost touching her cheek. She bent her head just enough that his hand came in full contact with her face. Heather bent forward to kiss him again and he left his hand caressing her. 

He was touching her body and she could tell he enjoyed it.  He pulled her shirt up to get to what was underneath and she flattened her stomach as his hand brushed by it. 
Craig brought his hand up to his mouth, and spit onto his fingers. He rubbed them on her as he moved his body over hers. She winced, but then he was in. As he kissed the side of her neck, she was being loved by him. She loved the feel of his skin, the smell of his cologne, the tickle of his stubbly cheek as it rubbed against her neck. She loved his chest pressed against hers, the weight of him above her; she ran her hand from his shoulder blades down his spine to the curve of his backside. She let the shower water run over her head again. Breathing the steam deeply, smiling at the memories of his touch. 

Pulling her head back out of the stream, she squeezed the excess water from her hair. The huge tangle was still there, but smaller now, her hair was smooth and silky over the top of it. She piled it back on top of her head, still coated in conditioner. Shifting her weight she pulled up the other leg to begin the process all over again. Lathering up with shaving cream, she once again mowed smooth tracks up her leg with her razor. When rinsing the leftover shaving cream off her second leg, she rubbed the two together. Naked skin against naked skin. Her top stayed tangled about her shoulder. When Craig began to move, after that initial pleasure, she noticed his socks were still on. She noticed that her shirt was cutting into the soft underneath of her arm. Sarah walked by the door, Heather recognized her laugh and wondered what was so amusing outside of this room. Sarah might have more friends but they never touched her like this. 

Craig grunted, he shifted his weight too far down, she stretched to meet him but it hurt. She groaned but her sound was interpreted as pleasure, as he shifted down again, she tried to reposition to avoid the feeling of him tearing into her. Craig was beginning to sweat. The smell of his cologne faded unevenly, revealing the smell of sweat and deodorant underneath. His back was becoming sticky; his breath was stale with alcohol and cigarettes. He moved to kiss her, Heather moved her head and kissed his neck, it was slick, and she didn't open her mouth. He began moving faster, she moved with him, hoping to encourage him to finish up. He was heavy; she was suffocated underneath his shoulder. She panted, trying to get enough air, trying to breathe around his smell, his sweat. She usually took the effort to fake it for them, make them feel better; but panting beneath Craig, all she could do was close her eyes. Craig was panting as well, his breath heavy and foul. She had stopped looking at his face, couldn't stand his eyes in that half light. His eyes were half closed and unfocused, he couldn't see her anymore.
 
In the shower, she pulled mercilessly at the last tangle at the back of her hair. She'd known the tangle was forming when Craig had increased pace, to the speed that always meant the end. She could hear the party, someone had changed the music. She wondered where Sarah went off too, if she had hooked up with anyone. Craig shifted his body down unexpectedly, Heather cried out and he cried out with her. The two cries had vastly different meaning. Biting her lip, she could still feel Craig's increased pace. She knew he was almost done. She couldn't stop him now, easier to let him go, easier than him asking questions. She imagined how he would look at her if she stopped him. Stopped him right then, right before he was done. Would the prettiest girl in the room suddenly turn into a pudgy lumpy girl with big hair? Perhaps she couldn't find love looking the way she did.  Heather didn't bother to meet him anymore; he had reached around and had lifted her up. She wondered if he could tell, she didn't think he could. 

She had pulled her shirt back over her head and rubbed the sore part of her underarm with out even looking at him. Heather had purchased the low cut tank top to make her father uncomfortable. Although he paid for it, she didn't think he'd ever seen it. She stuffed her socks, panties and bra into the big front pocket of her sweatshirt and pulled it on as well. Heather managed to look over at Craig; he was focusing on redoing his belt. She watched him pull back on his shoes, still wearing his socks. She didn't try to talk. She made an attempt to pat down her hair, knowing the knot would be incredible, and he didn't try to kiss her. He grabbed a pen off a desk in the room and scrawled his number on a scrap of paper. Heather smiled awkwardly and took the paper; hugged him just as awkwardly and left him there to find Sarah.

 After three handfuls of conditioner, she'd finally worked the entire tangle out of her hair. Standing under the showerhead, she ran her fingers through her hair. It was clean and smooth, weaving between her fingers, offering little resistance to her improv brushing. Rubbing water now on her face, she shook her hair out behind her, enjoying the feeling of it as it brushed against her now clean back. She squeezed the water out of it one last time, and turned the taps, reducing the shower to a drip. 

Heather stepped out of the shower, shaking her legs one at a time to get the extra water off. Grabbing her first towel, she wrapped it around her hair, the second she made quick work of drying off her body. Wrapping the second towel around her chest, she opened the door to the bathroom, letting the steam billow out into the hall. She shed her towels and stood before the mirror as it slowly revealed her reflection through the fog. She felt her own naked body, there alone, and tried to love it. Heather tried to imagine what Craig had seen. Her hands slid over her hips and across her stomach.  She practiced letting her belly relax.  Heather looked at herself, and practiced letting her self relax. The clothes that were bought as an apology lay crumpled on the floor; they had failed in finding her more than a first moment of love. 

Picking her hair brush from the counter she ran it through her now smooth hair. She thought of Craig's eyes and the feeling she'd gotten when he'd run his fingers down her spine, then the comforting weight of him above her. As she shifted her weight she could feel the soreness at her center. Bending down she found the tank top and the low rise tight pants piled on the floor. She smelled clean, but they still reeked of smoke and sex and keg beer. She stuffed them into the garbage can next to the toilet, the paper with Craig's number still in the pocket

"event","I actually went to the gymn today, and while i was sweating away on the arctrainer and staring out the window across Montlake, i saw the strangest thing. I blue sparkely ribbon fell from the sky, following a strange red lump. I've never seen this happen before, but i'm pretty sure a balloon popped somewhere and fell down across the street from the IMA. 

I don't know if anyone else did this, but on my birthday, when i still had sleepovers where you would all try to stay up all night long, as if this was some fantastic feat that only the cool kids would do, i would take my birthday balloons outside with friends. The three of us would stand outside with a sharpie, and write on the balloons: ""Happy Birthday Melissa"", before letting them go. I always imagined them floating across the ocean, having some other young girl  with straight hair and without glasses that were half and inch thick find it, slightly deflated the next day. This girl who was just like me, except prettier and better would find it, and wonder who Melissa was, and wish her a happy birthday before running back into her own house in where-ever. 

Kinda sad to think, all of those balloons i sent up into the air with birthday wishes or ""I graduated the sixth grade!"" messages, popped somewhere when they were too high up to maintain pressure and fell down some where mundane, like infront of a gymn. No one got to read my messages. 

By the time i left the gymn, after a quick sauna and looong hot shower (gymn showers always have better water pressure then home showers), by the time i left, i had forgotton about the balloon. I was on my cell already, and whining about the hill i had to climb becuase i had been climbing false hills on machines and didn't want to climb real ones. I didn't run across the street and check if there was a message from some little girl on the side of the balloon. i wonder now, if there was."

Dialogue.
""I went last time,"" Sarah said as she turned the lights out. 
""It's your turn,"" Greg responded as he flipped on the smaller orange light, the one that wouldn't expose the sensitive black and white photography paper. 
""This doesn't count. Graduation isn't a turn.""
""That's what you said about summer vacation, and that turned out to definitely be a turn,"" Greg took a deep breath before pouring chemicals into separate bins. 
""You were speeding! If you hadn't gotten pulled over, everything would have been fine,"" she wasn't looking at him, she was flipping through negatives. 
""If! If? If your son hadn't hid his pot in the car I couldn't have been arrested in the first place!""
""My son? It wasn't the first time you've 'had a run in with the law' because of drugs. I, on the other hand, have never touched them. He's your son.""
Greg glared at her, ""that was twenty years ago. I quit before we even met. It was just a college thing.""
""I guess Mark just started earlier than you.""
""That's not fair.""
Sarah found the negative she was looking for and separated that particular strip from the pile. With the strip in hand, she glared right back at Greg. The orange darkroom light reflected wildly off his glasses. ""I have to buy a plane ticket every time I want to see my baby. When I fly for 4 hours and spend that money, my son won't talk to me. He blames me for it.""
""It was our only option, to send him. He was going to be expelled.""
Sarah turned on the enlarger, a bright round light appeared on the counter below the machinery. She sighed shakily, her hands resting in the light, the diamond in her wedding ring dazzling her eyes. ""How did we mess up so badly?""
Greg reached out, resting his hand on the back of her neck, ""it's not our fault.""
She lowered her head to the desk, Greg's hand loosing contact. ""He's ours. We raised him, and now he's so unhappy. He's on anti-depressants, he's doing drugs, his friends are bad and I still can't talk to him. We sent him to live three states away.""
""It wasn't real drugs. It was just pot.""
""Does that make it better? Does that bring him back? Does that change the charges that have been brought up against him, does that get him back into the local high school? And you, acting like it was no big deal didn't help either. You just confused him into thinking what he did was ok behavior!""
""I never told Mark that smoking pot was a good thing!"" Greg snatched Sarah's chosen negative out of her hand, ""I never even told him I used to because you thought it would influence him. Maybe if he'd had a chance to learn from my mistakes he wouldn't have had to gone and made them over again. Brilliant idea, showing us as the perfect children growing up so when OUR children have a problem, they can't talk to us. You think Mark can't talk to you because he blames you, I think he can't talk to you because he's afraid of how you will judge him."" Greg turned away from Sarah, slamming himself into the stool in front of the enlarger. He inserted the negative into the machine and angrily twisted dials, attempting to focus the image on the table below. 
Sarah watched the blurry image. Greg was using too much force and couldn't get the image to stay in focus. The chosen picture was one of Mark, taken in a moment when he was smiling, the sun was shining off his blonde hair and metallic braces. She watched her son slide in and out of focus, her shoulders began to shake. Her voice showed her emotion, ""lets both go. Please."" Greg took a breath and the picture was laid out perfectly in negative. 
He turned to look at his wife, ""I thought we couldn't afford it.""
""Our son is graduating. We have to afford it.""

<lj-cut text=""Cleansing"">
Cleansing

She stood by the toilet, fully clothed, while she turned on the shower. She was still wearing the clothes from last night, most of them. They were sticky against her skin and pulsated with the beat of the veins in her head. Her body reacting to the alcohol from the night before and caused the throbbing headache. She sneezed, another reaction to the smoky rooms last night. 
Glancing at the mirror, her hair stood on end and the make up around her eyes had smudged and smeared. What was left around her eyes looked beaten and bruised. Wincing, she looked away. 
The only noise in the apartment was the shower beating water against the floor, filling the room with steam. Sneaking a glance at the mirror, her reflection had become distorted. Her blackened eyes became haloed by the steam, then disappeared completely, all that was left were splotches of color. The steam began to strangle her beneath her sticky clothes. As she shed them, the comfort of the heat and steam in the empty house kept her from feeling exposed. 
Her high school sweatshirt went first, with the name of every student in her small graduating class on the back. Her socks, bra and panties still in the kangaroo pocket. She pretended not to notice the lump in the pocket and threw the whole package in the corner. Tank top and pants followed, her belt slapping angrily against the floor. The noise made her jump; the quickened heart rate sent a new throb of pain to her aching head. Ignoring the pulse against her brain, she climbed into the shower. 
It was hot. She eased her knees into the spray, folding her arms in front of her to protect breasts and belly from the heat. Refusing to adjust the taps cooler, she moved her head underneath the water. The water slowly worked its way through her hair and onto her scalp. She sighed with relief, it was too hot for her head to ache. The water released the smell of last night into the bathroom. Cigarette smoke filled her nose and made her eyes water. The brand Craig was smoking last night was more pungent then the smoke she was used to. She wasn't going to think about Craig. 
Turning around she let the spray run down her back, loosening her hair she half heatedly combed at it with her fingers. She was fully aware the giant snarl at the back of her head would need more work. She didn't think about lying on a bed as her scalp ground her hair against the pillow causing this monstrosity. Instead she poured shampoo onto her palm. Craig's cigarettes began to fade with the smell of perfume and soap. She'd met him last night, still wondered what brand it had been that had smelled so foul in her hair. She didn't know his last name. 
As she rinsed the shampoo from her hair, she became aware of the odor of sweat, hers intermingled with his. Her sweat she didn't mind. The other she pretended not to notice. She dumped too much conditioner onto her palm and worked it into the mat of her hair. The mat created by friction of her head against the bed. The conditioner loosened it enough that she could pile it out of the way on top of her head. 
Mixed with the smell of foreign sweat was foreign cologne. When she had first smelled it last night, it had smelled good, clean. She had looked at Craig's eyes for the first time; he had made his way across the party after she initiated eye contact. He was standing slightly behind her. His breath warm on her ear, one hand came from his side and ran from between her shoulder blades, sliding down her spine coming to rest above the curve of her backside. He mumbled something sweet and she had accepted by smiling and holding his eye. Pouring soap onto her sponge puff she scrubbed as far as she could down her back.  
The soap began to foam, and she coated her body with it. She avoided one area; it was still sore from the night before. The rest of her body she scrubbed until she turned red beneath the foam. The smells were gone, covered with the thickly perfumed foam, and then rinsed away. Her skin was left feeling squeaky clean. Like glass. 
Picking up her shaving cream, she stepped far enough away from the stream of water to lather up her first leg. The faint stubble that had grown since the day before tickled her palms as she worked up the foam. She was sure Craig hadn't noticed. He had slid right past her legs to the place that she had avoided with her sponge puff. She hadn't been ready for that, her shirt was tangled about her shoulder and his socks were still on. The party could be heard on the other side of the door, she could hear conversations as people came close to the other side. She wondered if it was locked, but didn't feel like asking. Picking up her razor from the side of the tub, she took a deep breath before touching the cold blades to her skin. She was disappointed, she liked her legs, and it was too bad they had been completely ignored. She slowly glided the razor from her ankle up her calf to her knee. She watched the clean trail of skin revealed beneath the layer of foam. She repositioned the razor, and cleaned another trail from ankle to knee, slowly rotating around her own leg. She enjoyed the feeling of her own naked skin against her hand as she rinsed the remains of shaving cream from her legs, then rubbed the newly naked one against the still prickly one. 
In between legs, she finally got the nerve, to take a hand full of clean water and rinse that one last area of herself. She felt lopsided, standing with unbalanced legs, but she couldn't stand Craig being on her anymore. He hadn't even bothered to warm her up, her pants were on the floor and his were next to them. It had been too late to back out, she'd told her self. She'd initiated eye contact; she'd chosen to be in the room. She knew what that room meant. Craig brought his hand up to his mouth, and spit onto his fingers. He rubbed them on her as he moved his body over hers. She winced, but then he was in. As he kissed the side of her neck, she loved him. She loved the feel of his skin, the smell of his cologne, the tickle of his stubbly cheek as it rubbed against her neck. She loved his chest pressed against hers, the weight of him above her; she ran her hand from his shoulder blades down his spine to the curve of his backside. She let the shower water run over her head again. Breathing the steam deeply, smiling at the memories of his touch. 
Pulling her head back out of the stream, she squeezed the access water from her hair. The huge tangle was still there, but smaller now, her hair was smooth and silky over the top of it. She piled it back on top of her head; it was still coated in conditioner. Shifting her weight she pulled up the other leg to begin the process all over again. Lathering up with shaving cream, she once again mowed smooth tracks up her skin with her razor. When rinsing the leftover shaving cream off her second leg, she rubbed the two together. Naked skin against naked skin. Her top had stayed tangled about her shoulder. When Craig had begun moving, after that initial pleasure, she noticed his socks were still on. She noticed that her shirt was cutting into the soft underneath of her arm. One of her friends walked by the door, she recognized the laugh, she wondered what was so amusing outside of this room. Craig grunted, he shifted his weight too far down, she stretched to meet him but it hurt. She groaned but her sound was interpreted as pleasure, as he shifted down again, she tried to reposition to avoid the feeling of him tearing into her. Craig was beginning to sweat. The smell of his cologne faded unevenly, revealing the smell of sweat and deodorant underneath. His back was becoming sticky; his breath was stale with alcohol and cigarettes. He moved to kiss her, she moved her head and kissed his neck, it was slick, and she didn't open her mouth. He began moving faster, she moved with him, hoping to encourage him to finish up. He was heavy; she was suffocated underneath his shoulder. She panted, trying to get enough air, trying to breathe around his smell, his sweat. She usually took the effort to fake it for them, make them feel better; but panting beneath Craig, all she could do was close her eyes. Craig was panting as well, his breath heavy and foul. She had stopped looking at his face, couldn't stand his eyes in that half light. His eyes were half closed and unfocused, he couldn't see her anymore. 
In the shower, she pulled mercilessly at the last tangle at the back of her hair. She'd known the tangle was forming when Craig had increased pace, to the speed that always meant the end of these sessions. She could hear the party, someone had changed the music. She wondered where her friends went off too, who they had hooked up with. Craig shifted his body down unexpectedly, she cried out and he cried out with her. The two cries had vastly different meaning. Biting her lip, she could still feel Craig's increased pace. She knew he was almost done. She couldn't stop him know, easier to let him go, easier than him asking questions, easier than her having to defend her self. She didn't bother to meet him anymore; he had reached around and had lifted her up. She wondered if he could tell, she didn't think he could. 
When she had left the bedroom, when she had pulled her shirt back over her head and rubbed the sore part of her underarm. When she had stuffed her socks, panties and bra in to the big front pocket of her sweatshirt. When Craig had pulled back on his shoes, still wearing his socks, they didn't talk. She tried to pat down her hair, knowing the knot would be incredible, and he didn't try to kiss her. They smiled awkwardly, exchanged phone numbers, hugged, and she had left him there as she went to find her friends. By the time she'd left the party, she'd lost his number. After three handfuls of conditioner, she'd finally worked the entire tangle out of her hair. Standing under the showerhead, she ran her fingers through her hair. It was clean and smooth, weaving between her fingers, offering little resistance to her improve brushing. Rubbing water now on her face, she shook her hair out behind her, enjoying the feeling of it as it brushed against her now clean back. She squeezed the access water out it one last time, and turned the taps, reducing the shower to a drip. 
She stepped out of the shower, shaking her legs one at a time to get the extra water off. Grabbing her first towel, she wrapped it around her hair, the second she made quick work of drying off her body. Wrapping the second towel around her chest, she opened the door to the bathroom, letting the steam billow out into the hall. She shed her towels and stood proudly before the mirror as it slowly revealed her reflection through the fog. She lotioned, and powdered, she perfumed and finally the mirror was ready for her to put on her make up. She leaned over the counter, brushing a bare hip against her cell phone. It was about time for her friends to call, they had a party to go to tonight. 
She leaned back, and brushed her now smooth hair. She remembered Craig's eyes, and the feeling she'd gotten when he'd run his fingers down her spine. She composed how she'd gloat to her friends, how she'd tell them how smooth his skin was with his chest pressed against hers. How beautiful the beginning was. She wondered who'd be at the party tonight; she wondered whom'd she meet. She hoped he'd be good.

"event","Once upon a time a beautiful girl was forced to take on a job as a barista. The pay was crappy and the job mindless but the customers were nice and the tips were good. She actually began to enjoy the job, until one day a rat moved into the building. Tully's tried and tried to get rid of the rat, to no avail. It was some sort of super rat that resisted the glue boards and snapping traps as it ate rugs and chewed through walls making it's nest. The icky rat scared the beautiful girl shitless as it would scurry around early in the morning when she opened or late at night when she closed. The beautiful girl began having to stomp and kick walls in hopes to scare it away. The rat stayed away for a while, but he was a smart little devil. The rat became braver, and ran out of it's hole during the morning Saturday rush. Patrons were screaming and little girls were turning over chairs to find the feind. The manager chased the rat with a broom until it ran up a brick pole to the vaulted 30ft celing. As the manager climbed a latter to kill the evil rat, it jumped from the celing landing 20ft below onto the bar, where customers drinks were made. It scurried, people screamed, and it made it back to it's hole. Now the beautiful girl is quitting the pest filled store, but not before Terminex is planning a stakeout of the rat. Terminex and the manager will have to sit in the dark and hope the devil rat comes out and shoot it with an air riffle. The End"

"event","Once upon a time a straight girl met a gay boy. He was fun and exciting and had lots of fun, she was fun and up for anything. Sean and her had lots of fun, then her friends told her that he was bad news. She talked to Sean and he told her his side of the story, she decided that he was too much fun and hoped that he really was sorry and upset about the whole thing. The two had more fun, she realized that she was buying him a lot of drinks and that he would eat from her kitchen like it was his own, but she decided to ignore that. 
Then one day Sean decided that her Rx was his, he emptied out the whole bottle, and picked up the gross one off the floor and she drove him home not even suspecting. He went and gloated to all of his friends that he was on Rx and even gave away some of the stolen Rx to HER friends. 
When our heroine confronted the big gay theif, he insisted that he'd gotten the Rx from someone else, and that he was pissed at her. 
The moral of this story: Don't steal from me and give my goods to Kammee. That's fucked up plus you loose all your Tully's friends."

Grande Why Bother

	Evil to a child is a cackle followed by ""I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!"" This quote has haunted American children for years until recently a book came out: Wicked. The main character, the Wicked Witch of the West originally from the Wizard of Oz. Wicked takes the classic tale and retells it through the eyes of the Witch. The reader discovers that the Witch in actuality is a good person trying to get back the shoes of her dead sibling. The tale of Dorothy and the evil Witch becomes the tale of a misunderstood green skinned woman and the insipid girl stealing family heirlooms. Good has become evil and evil has become good. 

	This is the world we are living in today. Society no longer believes in good and evil, every thing exists in the gray area for the lawyers to decide. Serial killers can't be evil instead mentally incapacitated. Terrorists aren't the axis of evil, they are a marginalized group standing up for a different belief system that we can't dismiss, only disagree. Black and white, the yin and the yang no longer exist; they have been swirled together until we are left with the confusing mass of gray.  

	When the bank makes an error in you favor, or your barista rings in your drink for far too cheep, do you keep the extra money? What if you are strapped for cash? What if you will only use it to buy enough food to get you through the week? The lines between right and wrong can be rationalized away with only a few excuses. I have friends that will take that money back to the cashier, and others that will pocket it as a poor college student whom the money gods have smiled upon. When extenuating circumstances occur small sins are made good, white lies are created for people to make themselves feel better. The act of taking the extra money is technically stealing, the money isn't yours, but the offence is so small that it no longer matters to anyone; the intent isn't malicious so no one gets hurt. What if you pocketed the money without counting it first, what if you had no knowledge of the crime in the first place? Does that negate the fact that you have the extra money? Does that negate the fact that you are still a thief? 

	Taking that extra money does not a bad person make. The person who would give the money back to the cashier is not a more pious person then the one who pocketed it knowingly or unknowingly; both sets of people are more than this single instance in their lives. This one tiny sin or mitzvot will not damn or save either party. Make the sin bigger; make it a terrorist on an airplane. Make the sin be that of a people desperately trying to combat a bigger nation taking over their culture. Taking over a culture is much easier than taking over the actual land, tanks and military are involved in conquering a nation, but if you can conquer a nation with your popular culture there is no longer a need to physically take the land when you are already the leader. The smaller country desperately attempts to fight back in this culture war, but when our pop-culture is as prevalent and addicting as it is, there is no way to compete. There's no way to compete with McDonalds or Wall-Mart, so a group fought back the only way they knew how. They fought back at the society that created the pop culture; they attacked an icon of the society of money. Flying a plane into the world trade center killed many innocent people and killed the men doing the killing. That plane served another purpose; it got their message out. Before those attacks the cries of decent from an outside nation, from outside pop culture, went unheard by the American people. We can hear them now; we know now what they are fighting against. Was the act of suicide killings evil? Not seen from their point of view. Suicide was the only way to get themselves heard. Was their act of protest good? Not seen from the point of view of the thousands of families that lost loved ones, not to the people who died on the planes and in the buildings, not to us. 
Heaven and hell have ceased to exist along with the disappearance of good and evil. Humans went beyond the belief in a god when the majority of the bible stopped applying to today's world. We no longer offer up out daughters for rape, or our sons for sacrifice, we no longer kiss the robes of a man in a position no longer in existence. Christians eat pork on Fridays, and Jews turn on lights on Saturdays, the traditions have become obsolete. Hundreds of religions have sprung up with the development of today's society and none of those religions have proven themselves right. It's become the conclusion that all religions are right. Yet every religion conflicts with ever other one, so it can be assumed that every religion is wrong. With the death of religion comes the disappearance of god. For as Baudrillard suggests, to believe in god is to negate it's existence in the first place. Without god there can be no devil; without white there can be no black. 

Yet hate and religion has come back to the forefront of society, proven by this past election. After the election there were lots of theories to why and how Bush won. One of these theories blamed it all on the gays, which is a view becoming widely considered correct by even the pro-homos. The gay marriage issue was big this year, bigger than the botched war going on Iraq, bigger then Medicare and the VA fund, bigger than the Supreme Court Justices that will soon be reappointed. Gay marriage, AKA moral values, was the focal point. Preserving the sanctity of marriage is what the right wings have been spouting all along; the marriage between same sex couples goes against god. When the divorce rate in this country is above 50%, when single mothers raise children on wages below the poverty line, there are more important things to worry about than two women who love each other getting all the legal benefits of a marriage. The sanctity of marriage is as gone as the virginity of a prostitute, and no one seemed to notice the loss of either one. That is until that hooker tries to get married or a better job and society looks down on her for not being pure. In years past it has been illegal for whites and blacks, for whites and Hispanics, for whites and Asians, for whites and Filipinos, for Filipinos and Filipinos to marry. Apparently in the land where all men are created equal only all straight white men are created equal. The people crowing for the sanctity of marriage don't care that they are history repeating or notice the repressing of a vibrant and alive sub-culture in the US. They see hate and it looks like a blessing. 

The ideal marriage is the coming together of two people under god, except what if the two people don't believe that god exists? Or as in Fight Club, ""consider . . . the possibility that god doesn't like you. Could be God hates [you]. This is not the worst thing that can happen . . . getting God's attention for being bad [is] better than getting no attention at all."" (141). Is the marriage between two straight atheists unsanctified? If yes, there are thousands of bastard children running about without a clue that their parents wedding vows meant nothing, because they weren't made to god. Two people made vows to each other, made vows in love, recognized by the state but because of their disbelief in a creator they are now living a lie. 

The rousing cry ""what about the children!"" has been bringing donors to millions of different charities. What about the children who are living lives with two loving parents whose vows have been made obsolete? These children are living a lie along with their parents, along with the rest of the world. If the rest of the world thinks something is true, this lie becomes reality. O.J. Simpson was found innocent, it is now a reality that he is a free man and didn't commit the crimes he was accused of. What in reality happened and what the rest of the world holds as truth may be two different things, but no one will ever know. No one ever knowing, no one ever believing questions the fact that the event happens, it destroys the event. The event never happened. This theory can be proven wrong, there is always evidence no matter how hard you try to cover it up. When you fart in class, it may be silent but someone will smell it and the evidence is there. When your cousin kills a man in a car jacking, you can hide the gun from the police and ditch it in a dumpster. The gun covered in fingerprints and DNA could send that cousin for jail for a long time. Evidence in today's law has gone down to the tiniest of tiny, down to DNA samples. When people dig down into the basic particles of life, when you look at something so close, the rest of reality becomes pixilated and estranged. With a focus as small as DNA evidence, with the picture of the tip of a pin looking like a flattened desert, the bigger picture gets completely lost to the rest of the world. The cousin in the car jacking, he was jobless and loosing his home. The cousin was desperate to just survive another day. The cousin didn't leave his house that day thinking somebody was going to die; he didn't leave the house thinking that today he was going to become a murderer. When brushing his teeth, when putting on his socks he wasn't thinking about his family or his friends and how the actions of today were not only going to rip his life apart but all of theirs as well. Where is the DNA evidence to support this? Where is the hair sample to show a guy who was trying to scrape by and hopefully pull himself out of this life and into something better? Where is the fingerprint showing the kid messed up from childhood by bad homes and bad schools and bad roll models being shoved into a tiny box for the rest of his life? The gun in the dumpster was never found.  

Thieves and liars is what we have all become, purposefully or not. When going on the first date, we search our pasts, painting the best picture possible to present to our potential mate. We tell stories that we've heard from friends, or from people at parties, stories that we wish could have happened to us. Usually these stories are little white lies, little segues into a bigger view we have on life. Lies are still lies whatever color they are painted. We keep the unsavory parts of our personality a secret. It would be the end of dating if upon meeting people opened up with all their insecurities and history. It would also be the end of horrible traumatic breakups if each person knew exactly what they were getting into when the relationship began. Yet knowledge is not belief, being told straight up that the prospective partner is a ""dick"" and will in all likelihood fuck with your emotions, you may still not believe them. Although both of you are actively seeing other people, the way he acts around you, as if you are the only one he sees takes belief to a whole knew level. Knowledge takes the back seat and belief and the ideal begin to drive. To believe in the relationship is to negate it existed in the first place. Belief can feel so good; belief can convince you that if you just keep trying it will work itself out. Belief creates the ideal mate in your mind and the desire to change the member of the opposite sex into the ideal creation. Belief keeps you beating the dead horse franticly, hoping that if you just try hard enough it will once again rise up the majestic steed it was. Belief tricks your knowledge, for if that horse did rise again it would not be majestic or healthy, it would be undead and sick. It would flounder and struggle and suffer in a way that would crush you under its hooves. For good or for evil, for both or for neither the horse is dead. No amount of belief can bring it back in any recognizable shape or form. 

All that is left is belief. Knowledge, truth and reality have deteriorated into the abyss of whirling perspective and over analization. To live life from day to day norms have to be established. The sky must be blue, there must be clouds, and the grass is green. To question if someone else is seeing the same blue or the same green as you must be pushed to the side just to be able to walk out of your house. Belief must be kept in order to cross a street without panicking about being hit by a car, belief must be kept that everything at the phone company will be running smoothly when you call your mother on your cell phone. Belief that all the bits and pieces of your car were put together properly when you go flying 90mph down the freeway. Every moment of every day is left to the belief in other people doing their job properly, people that you will never meet, people that have no connection to you other than the fact that their hands have touched your product sometime in it's long history. The author that wrote the book Wicked will never know your name or who you are, but you can read all the ideas and thoughts that came out of their head when they put their words onto paper. 

Today, more than ever before in history people are codependent. With out farmers in a far away state no one would eat, with out the tech support in India people would never know how to turn on and off their computer, yet these far away people we need to survive are people that we will never know. The tech support will never tell you about his kids or the life in upper middle class in India, common telephone politeness doesn't include hopes and dreams. Even your neighborhood barista may know about your kids, your job, your day to day experiences, but when she moves on to a new job you will never think twice about her. But of course, things are better now, you will get your grande decaf nonfat sugar free vanilla latte within five minutes along with a hello, a good bye and a friendly smile, fast and efficient and the same as at every other Tully's you could ever walk into. Good is judged by standardization, good is reliability, good is a Starbucks on every street corner so you never have to walk more than 10 steps for your daily coffee enema.  Good is the wicked witch, evil is the wicked witch, good is evil, god is evil and reality comes undone.

Our house looks like shit, and kinda smells like it too. I also picked a very bad time tonight to clean the kitten closet. 

I have discovered though, that coffee beans covers of ass smells. I'm still very impressed, i've been trying to decide if i mixed up coffee grounds into the kitty litter, if the kittens would still use it, and/or if it would help at all. the whole beans might be more absorbant then ground beans. If nothing else, i think it'd be a fun exparament. the kittens are being cute and sleeping, i hope they stay that way.

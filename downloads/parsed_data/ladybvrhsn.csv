"event","Okay, I had what I can confidently call the most amazingly strange dream last night. It was the year after Dumbledore dies in Harry Potter... And Lord Voldemort (who is acting with much more intelligence than apparent in the previous years) has taken over and has spies all over the place helping him take over the world. 

Now, of course, seeing as it is my dream, I am Harry Potter. But...for some reason I retained my gender. So I am Harry Potter with huge boobs and a vagina. Yeah. And then someone I work with turns up in the dream. She's indian and I guess she could be a parallel Parvati or Padma, but in reality her name is Jessie, which is the least indian thing I've heard of. 

So Harry Potter's (my) personality has become a mixture of Ron, Hermione, Harry and my own. Ron and Hermione aren't in the dream...Harry (I) am trying to find a way to stop Voldemort taking over (things have reached a rather desperate point obviously -- the students are being taught dark arts and how to be good death eaters and etc.) 

So...Jessie says hi to me on her way to unpack her things in her dormitory, and then she later comes out, veiled and in all white. She goes through this door that leads her to a walking escalator type thing, which leads her out another door further away, (think of a cuckoo clock track). The second door leads her to Voldemort, and he is going to preside over a wedding.

Now, I'm not too aware of why Voldemort wanted me to marry Jessie, maybe our offspring would have produced the most evil disciple Voldy could have wanted. So, I'm called to the headmaster's office, and the reason I can't marry her is because...I have no male reproductive organs.

Voldy being the nice and helpful person he is magicks me some testicles and a penis, and thus I become HERMAPHRODITE HARRY TO THE RESCUE. Or not. I try and run away...Voldy lets me go to the washroom where one of his spies helps me do up my hooker boots (sparkly and red...definitely marriage wear)

So, I suppose I get married to Jessie, who now seems to become a zombie, so she is probably under the Imperius curse. Voldemort throws us a huge wedding party, and he gives me these pills that I have to take (think 1984) and if I don't eat them he'll probably force me to...so I pretend to eat them. I chewed them up then pretended to choke. Went to the bathroom again and spit it all out. 

The pills were so that I would forget all of my magickal heritage and not remember how to perform spells or remember anything. One particular one I remember in my dream was the anti-herbology pill. I was especially scared to take that one because of the chance Voldy could use Devil's snare or some ridiculous thing to kill me without my knowing. 

The best part was being a hermaphrodite though."

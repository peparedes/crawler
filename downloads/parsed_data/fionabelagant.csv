Your birth on the 27th day of the month (9 energy) adds a tone of selflessness and humanitarianism to your life path. 

Certainly, you are one who can work very well with people, but at the same time you need a good bit of time to be by yourself to rest and meditate. 

There is a very humanistic and philanthropic approach in most of things that you do. 



This birthday helps you be broadminded, tolerant, generous and very cooperative. 

You are the type of person who uses persuasion rather than force to achieve your ends.

You tend to be very sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and you able to give much in the way of friendship without expecting a lot in return.</td>

	A scene took place on a BA (British Airways) flight between Johannesburg and London. A white woman, about 50 years old, was seated next to a black man. Obviously disturbed by this, she called the air hostess.
""Madam, what is the matter,"" the hostess asked.
""You obviously do not see it then?"" she
responded.
""You placed me next to a black man. I do not agree to sit next to someone from such a repugnant group. Give me an alternative seat.""
""Be calm please,"" the hostess replied. ""Almost all the places on this flight are taken. I will go to see if another place is available.""
The Hostess went away and then came back a few minutes later.
""Madam, just as I thought, there are no other available seats in the economy class. I spoke to the captain and he informed me that there is also no seat in the business class. All the same, we still have one place in the first class.""
Before the woman could say anything, the hostess continued, ""It is not usual for our company to permit someone from the economy class to sit in the first class. However, given the circumstances,
the captain feels that it would be scandalous to make someone sit next to someone so disgusting.""
She turned to the black man and said ""Therefore, Sir, if you would like to, please collect your hand luggage, a seat awaits you in
first class.""
At that moment, the other passengers who were shocked by what they had just witnessed stood up and applauded.
If you are against racism, please repost this message.
Have been watching comic relief - we are so damned lucky and I really don't think I'll ever take my family and friends for granted. I love you all. You're all wonderful people and I need to tell you more often."

It has all stemmed from one young woman, who calls herself Lucie, who has lifted photos from a number of movie-based fan sites, hotlinked a number of fan fictions from fanfiction.net and elsewhere, and even out and out copied text from sites and added it to her own so-called fan fictions.

Despite repeated warnings that what she's doing is wrong, despite her original website suffering from a mutiny within the ranks of her managers, despite being banned from fanfics.org, she continues. Her
latest site, http://groups.msn.com/thethunderbirdsarego , is difficult to get into, but I was able to get a list of the fics she has currently hotlinked to her site. If you are one of these authors, or know any of these authors, please alert them to this situation.

I can't remember much of the dream, but I can remember the who had caught Gordon's boyfriend Michael and the Hood had just killed him and he turned and shot Gordon. I had to wake up. I didn't want Gordon. Michael to die but the Hood is a pain in the a** sometimes. I woke up with the name of Gordon and Micael were the first names that came to mind. It's now to the point that I don't want to go back to sleep for fear that the Hood will try to kill one of the others. I am not going to let that happen."

Thunderbirds: Allzone Incident
By: Fiona Belagant

            Emilee waited with the Tracy family, Gordon was in critical condition. She could see the worry in everyone face. She was sitting on the couch. Alan came and sat by her. 
      ""Emilee he's going to be fine, he's a Tracy."" 
      ""That should have been me instead of him, at least they wouldn't be anyone worrying over me."" Emilee said quietly. Alan was shocked at her words.
      ""That's not true if you were lying in there Gordon and all of use would be here waiting to see if your okay.""
      ""I am going for a walk.""
      ""Be careful.""

    2 hours later

     Dr. Wiseman can out of the surgery. He didn't have an expression on his face. Jeff became worry at seeing this.
     ""Jeff, I am sorry. We did all we could, but we couldn't save him. He's asking for you guys."" Dr. Wiseman said, as the television caught their attention.
     ""Come live from Allzone Bridge...it seems like the singer Emilee Cambridge it going to jump of the bridge. We go life to the report that is at her side. A moment pass by and the report was shown with Emilee.
     ""Emilee why are you doing this?"" The reporter asked.
     ""I have to, it the only way to save my boyfriend's life. I struck a deal with Fate and I am willing to pay the price. I am not saying the name of who I love. If his family is watching,please tell him that I love him, and this was the only way."" Emilee said, as she jumped off the bridge to her death. Jeff and the otehr just watched in shock.
     ""What just happened?"" Gordon asked, coming beside his family. Lady Penelope fainted Jeff caught her. Tintin just cried into Alan shoulder. Lana just sat down on the couch Scott was by her side. Victoria came up to Gordon and hugged him.
     ""Gordon, Emilee struck a deal with fate. Her life you yours."" Victoria told him. He didn't believe it he fought to get away. He broke away, but only to stop by the television when he hear his girlfriend's name. He turned around and looked at the screen.
""Emilee why are you doing this?"" The reporter asked.
     ""I have to, it the only way to save my boyfriend's life. I struck a deal with Fate and I am willing to pay the price. I am not saying the name of who I love. If his family is watching,please tell him that I love him, and this was the only way."" Emilee said, as she jumped off the bridge to her death. Gordon fell to the floor and let the tears fall. He would never get to see his girfriend again. He cried for the first time since his mother had died. Everyone watched in sadness as Gordon cried. Alan came and held Gordon rocking softly back and forth."

"event","Alica sat in her room, she knew that her family the rest of them
were the Thunderbirds along with Tintin and Fermat. For some
reason her father didn't want her to be a Thunderbird. He was
sending her away. It wasn't fair her older and younger brothers got
to be Thunderbirds why couldn't she. She just accepted the fact that
her family didn't want her there anymore. So she decided to
leave on her own. She went and knocked on her father office
door, she waited for his reply.

 
Jeff Tracy sighed. He knew exactly who it was. And he felt
guilty. Alica wanted so badly to be a Thunderbird. A spot she so
rightly deserved. But he just couldn't let her. ""Come in."" He
answered the knock, trying to hide the guilt he was feeling.

It wasn't fair he treat her different. After all it wasn't her
fault. All of his children reminded him of Lucille. His lovely
wife. But Alica moreso as she was the girl...
 
She walked into her father office she didn't want to leave,but she
had too. Her father didn't want her there. She was already packed and
she was going to leave as soon as she finished talking to her father.
""Father, I decided to go to the mainland and get an apartment there.
I've decided to go and make it on my own. I will get a job and live
on my own."" Alica told her father, she hope that there was something
or someone that would stop her. If not she would go and get her own
life. She hadn't told any of her brothers because she knew that they
would stop her. She was glad that she didn't run into any of them.
She didn't know what she was going to tell her brothers if she did
run into them.

 Jeff was at a loss for what to say. ""Is there anything I can say or
do to make you change your mind? I don't want you to leave.""
He silently cursed himself, he knew this was mostly, if not all his fault.

 
Virgil decided to see what his younger sister was up to. He went to
her room and saw that she had her luggage packed. He had a worry
look on his face now. He didn't want his sister to leave. He was
going to get to the bottom of this. He could tell that his father
had treated her differently then the boys. To tell you the truth
Alica was the spiting image of their mother. He went to his father
office. He saw Alica looking at their father. He looked at his
father and wonder what was going on.

""Yes, you know what you can do to change my mind. If you can't do
that then I am leaving for the mainland."" Alica said unaware of
Virgil standing right behind her. Virgil was shocked; he didn't know
that Alica wanted to leave. They had a strong bond; he never thought
she wanted to leave the island. He looked at his father and waited
for his reply. What would the others say when they find this out.

 Jeff sighed heavily. ""I..."" He couldn't lose her. He couldn't go
through that again. He knew she was just as tough as his boys, but he
still thought of her as his little girl. He quickly glanced back when
he saw Virgil, but tried not to make it obvious. Alica would hate it
if she knew one of her brothers was listening.

He knew what he had to do. But would she see through it? ""You've got
one shot."" He said, ""We'll test you on all the 'birds. Tomorrow, you
can go on call with Virgil in Thunderbird Two. If there's a water
rescue, Gordon will take you out on Thunderbird Four. After that, a
space flight on Three where you'll spend a week on Thunderbird Five.""
He sat forward, ""If you can prove you're Thunderbird material, we'll
test you on One. Don't think you're getting special treatment though.
We're going to train 'round the clock. You'll do everything just as
the boys did. Nothing around here comes free.""

He desperatley hoped that she'd either get discouraged or flop on the
training. He also knew that she was a Tracy and she could deal with
anything her brothers could deal with.

And that was what scared him.
 
Alica couldn't believe her ears, did her father decide to give her a
shot now. This was good. She study him for a minute and she saw it
in his eyes. He wanted her here, but not as a Thunderbird. He still
wanted her to be his little girl. She knew differently. She was
going to prove to her family and to her father that she was
Thunderbird material.

The thing that her father didn't know was the her brothers have let
her go on practice runs with them she was able to fly Thunderbird
One, Thunderbird Two and Thunderbird Three and she could drive
Thunderbird Four. All her brothers espically Virgil knew that she
was Thunderbird material. They have trained her while her father
wasn't there. When he was on away on business. She had also gone on
a few rescue mission. She was already a Thunderbird not offical tho.
She wasn't going to tell that to her father tho. She hadn;t been on
Thunderbird 5, she could handle it. She missed having John around.

Virgil knew that each of them has shared the same secret, that when
they were away Alica accompany them on so rescue mission. She had
been a big help to them. One time they had to have some one to jump
to a catway that could only hold two hundred and fifty pounds no of
them could make it out there. The girl that was on the catwalk was
a hundred and thirty pounds. Alica was light enough to get to her.
If it wasn't for her they would have lost the young lady that was on
the catwalk. Virgil stood there and waited for Alica answer.
""How about we start my training today. I am Thunderbird
material, I don't want any special treatment. I am ready to start
training right this minute. I know nothing come for free. I am a
Tracy, I know the rules. Just treat me like one of the guys. "" Alica
told her father, she was ready for whatever he had for her. Virgil
decided then that he would entered he went back and made a bit of
noise to let his father and Alica know that he was coming into the
office.
""Hey, Dad what's going on."" Virgil said as he looked at his
father and Alica.

 Jeff was shocked at her enthusiasm and determination. He knew she was
just as stubborn as the rest of them, but he didn't expect this
comeback. He looked towards Virgil, ""You have to do some work on TB2
don't you?"" He sat back, ""Why don't you take Alica down there and
show her how Tracy's take care of their 'birds."" Jeff smiled, he knew
Alica wouldn't be put off by simple mechanics. But, if she wanted to
be a Thunderbird, she had to know the crafts better than the back of
her hand.

""Yes sure I take her and show her the ropes."" Virgil said, as both of
them walk out the door. Virgil waited till they were out of their
father hearing ranger before saying something to her.
""Thanks Virgil.""
""You were going to leave with out saying good-bye weren't you.""
""No, I was going to leave you all good-bye note for each one of you
guys. You know I would have to come after you.""
""I know.""
""Alica, you know you can talk to me.""
""Virgil. I know that we have a strong bond to one another. It just
like the bond that you have with Scott. I am happy that dad is now
giving me a chance to prove myself as a Thunderbird.""
""You are already a Thunderbird.""
""You and the other know, but Lady P, Parker, Brians and you're father
don't know that. I want to show them that I am a Thunderbird.""
""Hey, don't you have an appointment with Lady P tonight?""
""Yes, I better call her know and let her know what's going on."" Alica
started. Virgil nodded his head. Alica brought her wristwatch to her
mouth. ""Alica calling Lady Penelope.""



 Jeff watched as his son and daughter left the room. He then sighed
and took out ""ye olde training schedule"" and laughed. It was the same
rough schedule he'd used with all the boys during their training. He
never imagined he'd have to revive it after Alan finished training.

Lady Penelope answered right away, ""Lady Penelope speaking.""

Lady Penelope answered right away, ""Lady Penelope speaking.""
 
""Lady Penelope, something has come up and I am wondering if we can
reshchudle this meeting or should I say this dinner for another
time. Like in two or three months to be exact."" Alica said into her
watch.

Brains walk into Mr Tracy office. He wanted let him know that
Thunderbird Six was ready for action, but needed a pilot. He wonder
who would get it.
""Mr. Tracy, Thunderbird Six is re re re is good to go. All we need
is a pilot. Do you have anyone in mind?"" Brain looked at Mr. Tracy.
Thunderbird One was Scott's bird, Thunderbird Two was Virgil's bird,
Thunderbird Three was Alan's bird, Thunderbird Four was Gordon's
bird and Thunderbird Five was John's bird. Brains was hoping that
Thunderbird Six would be Alica bird, but it didn't look like that
was going to happen if Jeff didn't give his daughter a chance to be
a Thunderbird. Brain could tell that Jeff was worry about Alica and
didn't want to put her in harms way. He knew that Alica was a Tracy
and that she would find one way or another to become a Thunderbird.
Brians didn't let on that he knew Alica went on rescue and that she
was already trained as a Thunderbird by her brothers. This wasn't
his place to tell their father.

Lady Penelope smiled, ""Of course Alica, we can reschedule. Why the long wait?""

Jeff sighed, ""I honestly can't wait for to see Thunderbird 6 in
action, but Alica has to go through training before she gets a 'Bird
of her own. Even the boys weren't just *handed* their 'Birds, they
earned them. If she doesn't qualify, she doesn't get it.""
""The reason why is that I am training to be a Thunderbird. I hope
it's not to much trouble for you to reschedule."" Alica said. She
looked at her older brother, and she smiled at him.

""Ye...ye..ye...Of course Mr. Tracy. I am sure that she would be a
great Thunderbird. Qualify for a Thunderbird is easy with her
brothers help. She's been a Thunderbird for awhile now."" Brain
said, before realizing his mistake. He hope that Jeff didn't catch
it. He slowly inched towards the door. He wasn't about to be at
the recieving end of Jeff Tracy angry."

"event","Well it seems that that one is on hold I have the next two chapters ready to be posted but my computer is being a pain and won't let me use the A drive so I can get it to a computer that have internet access so I can post it. I am ready to drop kick my computer. Hey... it has to be a pain for some reason

Well, I have watched the first twelve episode of Thunderbirds the television series it's good. I'm defiantly getting more idea for stories now. It's really great that Thunderbirds were created.

The movie is awesome. I like the actors who portrayed the Tracy boys. Of course there are stories on http://www.fanfiction.net that I like. I probably will be doing review on them so watch out.

My mood is for my computer that is being a total brat right now. It's not at anyone it at my computer."

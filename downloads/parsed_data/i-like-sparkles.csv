"event","I really haven't been up to much that is very exciting the past month.  I did go see Blue Oyster Cult with Kyle, Mike, Jenny and Darren.  That was fun.  Kyle and I have gone out to a couple of movies within the last week...  Da Vinci Code was ok (the surprises in the plot aren't surprises when you've already read the book).  Over the Hedge was really enjoyable.  I think that I will buy it when it is released on DVD.  That is about it.  Oh yeah- I was elected as Secretary for Nu Chapter's (Alpha Xi Delta, my sorority) Corporation Board (the owners of the chapter house).  And I got a raise on Friday.  That was nice."

"event","Well, as per usual I haven't updated this thing in a really long time.  It's been kind of a hard time the last week and a half, because my Grandma Ethel had a massive aneurysm/brain bleed at the end of March.  My dad waited to tell me until about a week after it happened, because he wasn't sure just how serious it was, and I went to visit her in the ICU on April 7th.  She was really out of it, and the whole situation was really awful.  I've never been to an ICU ward before, and I hope that I never have to go back.  I turned 23 on the 13th, and Sharon (my biological mom) happened to be in town (although not for my birthday, which kind pisses me off, but that's a whole different issue), so she took Kyle and I out to dinner.  This past week has been kind of ho-hum, although I went to Easter brunch at Kyle's parents, and after his brothers came over for a few hours to play Oblivion.  Work went by pretty fast, which was good.  But on the way home from work I got a call from my dad asking how far away from home I was, because he was there waiting for me, which is a really bad sign, because I talked to him last night at around 9pm and he was at home in the Tri-Cities.  I kind of figured what the call was about, so I asked how Grandma was, and he told me that she passed last night around 11:30pm, but that he had wanted to tell me in person.  My dad spent the entire evening with us, which was really nice although it was kind of awkward because we would both just randomly burst into tears through out the night (I'm actually crying right now just thinking about the whole thing).  He is staying with my aunt (only because we don't have a spare bed) for the week.  My Grandma's services will be on Friday 4/21 at 11:00."

"event","Ok, to wrap up the tv debacle...  It turns out that since the box was opened (even though they were the ones who opened it) we could only get store credit that is good for one year or just trade it on the spot for another tv.  We ended up selecting a 30"" Sony Wega that happened to be on a killer sale, so it happened to be the same price as the crappy tv.  The Sony kicks so much ass, and we are so happy with it, so everything turned out well!

Today I got to meet the owner of my company, which was pretty cool.  His name is Tom, and he is really laid back.  He didn't look anything like I expected him to, so that was surprising.  He is going to stick around tomorrow just to see how things are going, and then he is going to head back up to Canada.  We'll see how things go tomorrow.

I also finally noticed some results from the healthy eating and exercise that Kyle and I have thrown ourselves into...  Although my weight is exactly the same as it was when we started this whole thing, I had to tighten my belt a notch today to keep my pants from falling down.  Honestly, I'm actually happier that I am loosing inches instead of pounds, even though most people measure weight-loss success by pounds lost.  I'd much rather be a little bit heavier but be toned and fit than to be lighter with a higher body-fat percentage.  Just because someone is skinny doesn't mean that they are fit, and I really want to be fit.

I take my car in to get the damage on it fixed tomorrow.  It's going to be awful to not have a car for several weeks.  Even though I'm not driving my car much since the accident, it's nice to know it's there if something does happen to come up."

"event","Our new Xbox360 arrived yesterday...  We thought that it was pretty cool, but we noticed that the screen was really dark and that the font was kind of fuzzy on our tv (which is only 2 years old, so it's not like it is that crappy).  So long story short, Kyle and I head off to Video Only to look at high-definition, flat screen tvs.  Against our better judgment we decided to buy a 34"" Toshiba for $850 ($925 after tax).  Keep in mind that this is at 8:00 at night.  The sales clerk asks us what type of car we are driving (the Civic), because the box is pretty big.  We decide that the box most likely will be a tight fit in the car, so we rush home to pick up my car before the store closes at 9:00.  We make it back around 8:45 with my car, and so the clerk wheels out the tv on a dolly.  The box that the tv came in ended up being so freakin' big that it wouldn't even fit in my car! (I have no idea how the clerk could have even thought that it would remotely fit into Kyle's car.)  So we decide that the only way that the tv is going to fit in my car is if we take it out of the box, which we end up doing.  We manage to get it home in one piece, but then we realize that I'm not strong enough to lift it out of the car (two clerks loaded it for us, so we didn't realize just how heavy it actually was).  We stood there for a few minutes pondering our fate when a totally random guy comes out of our downstairs neighbor's apartment.  I ask him if he could help us get it up to our front door, and he says that he would, which is totally sweet of him.  So Random Guy and Kyle manage to lug the tv up the stairs without dropping it, and Kyle and I manage to get it the rest of the way inside and on the tv stand.  We get everything set up, but by that point we are so tired that we end up just going to bed.  So today we've had more time to check out the tv more, and we realize that since we don't have high-def digital cable (and aren't planning on getting any time soon), that the regular cable picture is really grainy and crappy, and that even though the tv is a wide screen it cuts off several inches of our games because we can't get it to format correctly.  We also discover that the gamma setting on the Xbox was set low, so after turning that up the picture got much brighter.  Also, the font sharpness that was bothering me turned out to only be that particular game, because when we put in a different game it's font was fantastic.  On a whim we connect the old tv up to the Xbox and discover that not only with the gamma setting turned up that the picture is as bright as we want it to be, but that the formatting is better so you can see the entire game.  And we already had determined that without HD cable the cable connection sucked, which was never a problem with the old tv.  Sure, the games are nice and sharp, but they still look great on our old tv, so we've decided that the new tv is a total waste of money.  So tomorrow Kyle's mom and his brother Aaron are going to come over to help us load the whole thing back up and return it.  Thank God there is a 30-day return policy!!!  We'd be so screwed if there wasn't.  The lessons learned here are that you should never impulse buy; everything always looks better in the store than it does in real life; and that newer isn't always better."

"event","It's been a bit since I last updated this thing.  As per usual my life has been pretty unexciting, but these are the notable events...  

I went to a WANC meeting on 3/14 in Bellevue and ended up getting lost.  Every time we meet in Bellevue that happens, so at least this time I gave myself some wiggle room and ended up being about 25 minutes early.  This gave me some time to wander around BellSquare for a few minutes to kill some time.  While I was in Crate and Barrel my dad called.  It turns out that my great grandma Sarah had passed away the night before in her nursing home in Montana and he wanted to let me know that the funeral was going to be held on Saturday.  My mom and him were planning on going, but he told me that I didn't need to go.  I really can't be sad that she passed away, because she was suffering from Alzheimer's, and it was really bad.  It turns out that she died because she stopped eating and drinking, not from the Alzheimer's itself.  Another reason that I can't be sad was that we really weren't close at all, and in fact I hardly knew her because she spent most of her time in Montana, and so I didn't see her that much.  This brings me to the third (and most awful) reason that I wasn't sad about the whole thing...  I thought that she had died two or three years ago.  I really am a bad person.

We (and by we I mean Kyle) bought an Xbox360 on Wednesday online.  It should arrive tomorrow (3/20).  Kyle is so excited for it to arrive.  I think it is cute seeing him so giddy.  Yesterday (3/18) we went out and bout a few accessories and games for it.

Kyle and I went and saw V for Vendetta yesterday.  I really enjoyed it.  There really haven't been too many R-rated movies out lately.  It seems like everything is PG-13, even horror movies, which irks me to no end, so it was refreshing to actually see an R-rated movie that was semi-worthy of the rating.  

Well, that's all of the exciting news from the world of Danielle from this week!"

"event","Well, I really haven't done anything exciting since my last posting.  This weekend has been spent cleaning the house, shopping for things at Costco and Target, and watching movies.  Friday night Kyle and I watched Kinsey (it was ok) and Saturday night we watched Spanglish (it was entertaining enough, just a bit on the long side).  Tonight after dinner we plan on watching The Killing Fields (which should be really good since it stars Sam Waterston, whom we both love).  We have Netflix, which is such a good deal, but it means that we spend an extraordinary amount of time watching movies.

Oh yeah, and I took my car in to have it's damage inspected by Allstate and to get a referral to a body shop to have it fixed.  (I was rear-ended on I-5 on February 25th.)  The body shop has ordered the parts to fix my car (it needs at least 10 hours of work!)  Good thing that the accident wasn't my fault, and the woman who hit me has insurance, so she has to pay for everything."

"event","The past couple of days have been rather bland.  Get up, go to work, come home, go to the gym, make dinner, watch tv, go to bed.  I guess the biggest highlight is that last night there was a new episode of ""House"" on, which is always a treat, especially since Fox is always messing with their line-up because of American Idol.  I really don't find that show (Idol) particularly interesting past the first few audition episodes.  

Kyle isn't home right now because he went up to Seattle to play poker with Mike and a few other buddies, and now I really don't know what to do with myself.  I guess I'll figure something out.  I'll most likely play Xbox, because I only get to use it when Kyle isn't home because he spends so much time on it.  He has a really annoying habit of playing a game for 15-20 hours before he decides that he has messed up somewhere and needs to start all the way over in order to correct the mistake.

Oh yeah, and this wind and rain that we've had all day really sucks."

"event","Last night Kyle and I headed up to Seattle to go to Jenny's birthday party at Cowgirls Inc., where we proceeded to get hammered.  It was such a good time, and I'm really glad that I went, especially since I wasn't overly enthused about going.  I was struggling to justify the expense (taxis, cover, drinks, incidental costs), especially since I am trying to save up as much spending money as I can for a trip to Vegas Kyle and I are taking July 30-August 3.  In the end everything ended being much cheaper for me than I thought (I only spent $25).  Not for Kyle though, as he ended up spending $110 on drinks.  Ouch!  Oh well, he can afford it.  The bar was much smaller than I imagined, and there were a lot of creepy old men leering at all of the girls there (which wasn't many).  I guess that the bar wasn't as much fun as the company we were with was: Mike, Jenny, Beck, Seth, Gavin, Shaun Guay, Katie Figgis, Erika Monges, Merimee, and Jenny's friends Andre and Darren.  Freese and Goo were no-shows though, which was too bad as I love hanging out with those guys.  After the bar some of us went back to Mike and Jenny's place and hung out until 3am.  I don't remember the last time that I stayed up that late.  Kyle and I ended up sharing the couch and now I am really stiff today.  We were all pretty hungover this morning, which sucked.  Driving home to Federal Way fighting back nausea isn't very fun.  At least my sunglasses are great for hangovers because they are rather large and block a ton of light.  Lexi my dog was glad for us to be home and was very happy to be taken for a quick walk.  We ate some McDonald's that we picked up on the drive home, and that really hit the spot.  (I had 2 Egg McMuffins without the Canadian Bacon, 2 hash browns, and a large o.j.)  After eating, Kyle and I went to bed and slept off our hangovers until 2pm.  Now we are up and moving, and even though the weather is beautiful out I think we are just going to have a lazy day."

"event","Hmmm...  All the cool kids have a live journal, so I figured why not start one too?  I must say that I had a difficult time trying to think of a user-name.  I really wanted the name i_like_cheese, but that had been taken already, so I ended up with the craptastic name i_like_sparkles.  Everyone who sees my name will probably think that I am a semi-retarded 14 year old.  Oh well.  Instead of setting up livejournal, what I really should be doing is getting ready to go to Jenny's 23rd birthday party at Cowgirls Inc.  Mike and Jenny are kind enough to let Kyle and I crash at their place tonight, which is really nice of them, especially since the last time the four of us got together we drank ourselves into a stupor and paid for it the next morning by vomiting everywhere.  (Well at least Jenny and I did.)  Hey, at least we had fun and that is all that matters!"

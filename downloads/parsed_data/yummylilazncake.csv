Things are soo awesome at the moment! I got into A&M with a $12000 scholarship, and UT Liberal Arts. Now... I'm only waiting to hear back from Chapel Hill (march 31) and Duke (...no idea when).
I have an awesome prom date, who's more ecstatic and excited about prom than me (which is awesome b/c it takes a       top my enthusiasm sometimes...) and excellent prom activities all nice and planned out.
My little grlie is turning 18 tomorrow!! and we're going clubbing!!
and I love my friends and every moment of my life right now. 

Happiness is a blissful feeling. Aside from food, it's all you need.

Nesrstra has definitely outdone herself this time with her stupid, time consuming, outlandish projects. So... moreover... who got semicircles? (Raises hand.) Ha... I can barely draw a godforsaken semicircle on paper, nonetheless cut one out of foam. I      semicircles! ...at least now I do... 
The only educational part about this project is that once again... it is unwise to procrastinate until the very last minute..., foam is expensive but if you don't buy enough of it... WalMart is still open at 1:30... and yes. the weird people there that late are mostly Mexicans... and yes, they will hit on you, so be careful. Also, it is unwise to watch spraypaint dry... b/c about five minutes into the watching... you will get lightheaded, fall over, and somehow fall asleep in your garage.

I had breakfast (What in the world is breakfast?), lunch, snacks, and dinner everyday of the week! Soo awesome!! Soo much food!! I'm soo freakin happy! The Farmers Market is definitely my favorite place in L.A. Brazilian food is the Shiznit. The traffic is horrendous and the people there drive worst than I do! (yea.. I know... I didn't think it was possible either.. Unlike me, who barely passes drivers ed with a 3+, those people just buy their license.) 
Ohh mann.. Rodeo Dr. is soo awesome!! So many stores, so little time! Beverly Hills was massive and beautiful, of course. The beaches were alright... that sand is stupid and grainy, and when I fell in the stupid salty ocean, I got all scratched up everywhere... booo! Florida rules. So.. overall my trip wasn't insanely terrible like I predicted, it was actually pretty good. But it is good to be back.

I've missed you guys! Especially my little     ie and my silly little azn lemon juice obsessed     ie!

Oh yea... haha Kendra... you are an odd one... No worries... it only turns me on! ;)
Nothing would make me more happy than to spend every waking moment with you! (But I think Caleb might get jealous and turn into a crazy, psyho Mayan and come beat me with a machete and slit me accross the jugular with a spoon and then laugh while         on his Mayan tobacco.)"

"event","I went to A&M this weekend for this student leaders of tomorrow conference. Surpsingly, it actually turned out to be a leadership conference (I was expecting some insane A&M recruiting action). Anyway, it was really fun! The people in the conference were awesome! I got the chance to hear some pretty good speakers. (excluding the Pres. of A&M and that last guy..) Dr. Coleman was by far the best. It was an awesome experience and I met a lot of new people.

In regards to my opinion about A&M however, mannn.... talk about A LOT of white conservative hicks! goddamn! I've never seen so many white people in one place before. mann. I'm still recovering.. (They were all very nice though.) ohh man.. and there were soo many people from bootleg suburban towns that have only one mall. It was awesome meeting all these people from such different areas of Texas. 
I got to room with these two awesome     s. Engineering majors, not party animals, but they were sooo sweet! They bought this other      I roomed with from the conference and me a cheesecake! 
My facilitators were soo awesome. This Allison      was super adorable and sweet. My other leader, Howie, was super cute, sucks at reading, and overall incredibly awesome.
The campus is very suburban-like and its pretty spread out. I kinda like UT's campus better when compared to A&M.
Their Honors Program is kinda crappy... (so I hear) except for the Engineering field. 
Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to visit Northgate.. but hopefully if I go visit sometime, I'll be able to check it out.

Overall... this was a super fun and awesome experience! arg!! I can't wait until college!!

Everything I do seems be apart of this continuous cycle of doom ...and there's just no escape. It's insane! Cycle after cycle.... it's sorta like life is just these random repitition of events.. and these events just keep repeating themselves until you find some sort of peace (RIP) or you master responding to these situations (which just isn't possible). So yea... this sucks... actually.. I don't know. Maybe this could be a good thing.

On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
You don' know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free.

"event","ArG... i was incredibly depressed yesturday because i stupidly deleted at least 150 songs off my limewire and coudn't figure out how to restore them... i am a devestated idiot...

I spend most of my time with either Brandon or Chirag and it's awesome. Although it drastically interferes with my school work and college applications... I happily remain apathetic. 

There are soo many things I have yet to solve.. and so many events I have yet been able to clearly analyze. ....and it's weird... because I don't care...

I think the reason for all of this is because... after striving so hard to achieve something you have molded as great (much of it directly due to the expectations of society), and after so many years of compensating for bad grades with late nighters/all nighters, sucking up to teachers, lying, stealing, cheating, struggling with being able to successfully mount your backpack on your back without falling backwards, waking up to the same ringing/buzzing/chirping/wtvr every morning from 6-7:20, arguing with the parents about grades and then being grounded for them, stressing, pulling your hair out, constently banging your head on random moniters, folders, desks, or basically anything hard, punching holes in walls, sleeping in order to escape reality ...and bio hw, attempting to master the art of pencil twirling, joining random clubs ...and then participating in them ""for fun"" (in other words... ""so I can put it on my resume""), and eating the same, old, disgusting, horrendous cafeteria food ""specially"" prepared and served by our ""friendly,"" not unsanitary and evil lunch ladies every day during the school year for the past 3 years and counting you realize ...there IS more to life! ...but unfortunately... this dreaded, morbid, soulsucking routine WILL haunt you all through most of your life until you retire or decide to live off of welfare (which i do NOT recommend.. because if you are on welfare that means you are either A. Mexican or Black (no offense... I am not recist.. I only state the truth), B. White, 12, and have a child with a disability, or C. Are a paraplegic with no arms or legs, blind, deaf, and have a case of deadly foot fungus).

well anyway.. now that most of the load has been done away with, I am back to being the usual realist, apathetic, somewhat perky bum. Belle & Sebastian rock my face off!

...Daniel has inspired me to stop playing UT for a little bit and play gunbound... 

Jesus.. I don't think I've ever felt soo stressed and disoriented... I feel somewhat apathetic, depressed, carefree, and content. yea.. I didn't know it was possible either... all my emotions and opinions regarding everything and everyone just keeps clashing and changing. People whom i use to label as: annoying and ""ignant,"" I now look at differently. People whom I use to redeem as: ""fucking awesome,"" I no longer think of as ""fucking awesome."" God... I'm soo fucking confused... 
bahh... and what disturbs me the most during this crucial time is that I've never felt so alone in my life.

Oh yea... The Franz concert was fucking awesome!! it was like moshing without the elbowing and randomly hitting other people.


Hope dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemtion
Winding in and winding out
The shing of it has caught my eye
And roped me in 
So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing
I am captivated, I am

I feel like my head is about to explode. arg! There's just soo much going on at the moment... well actually.. it's more along the lines of: there's so much stuff going on in my head... but in reality, I follow the same regular routine.

I keep experiencing this blahful/depressed/apathetic feeling. --I need a psychologist...

Bloggin.. soo.. i finally began my college search. I have about 10 schools in mind that I'm considering... (I thought you guys should know so you can applaud me for accomplishing SOMETHING...) n.b. I'm still very iffy and nervous when it comes to college related research.. so I guess you can say this is a big step for me.

Anyway... on a more uplifting note.. Franz Ferdinand concert is WED!! YAY!
I can't wait until The Faint, Death Cab, and Taking Back Sunday."

"event","so. i was looking at college info. yesturday.. mann... no words are capable of expressing the bottomless pit, heart stopping, deer in headlights feeling i experienced. I think... well.. actually I KNOW the reason why i refuse to study for SAT's and look at college info. or even show the slightest bit of interest regarding college is because I'm fucking scared of it. The whole thought of actually having to be on my own, adapting to a new environment, and overall.. just having to ""grow up"" and work scares the living crap out of me. gahh.. I don't know what to do; nor do I have someone to run and hide behind... so I guess I better suck it up and deal with it.. soon!

"event","I wish I could be happy just living the simple life. I'd love, more than anything, to party everyday, and be able to remain apathetic to everything and everyone around me. But unfortunately, that kind of life is not suited for me as a llama would not be suited at perry's steak and grill. I've finally realized that no matter how hard I try to be content with what I have... it will never happen. I just can't accept the fact that we are nothing but mere humans who play one simple part in society. The thought of holding a simple job, a simple position, or/and leading the simple role of insomniac zoids everyday just does not appeal to me at all. Perhaps this is partly because I'm asian.. and asians are just never happy until they conquer the world. Or maybe I'm just ambitious because I was raised to be. I don't know. I've always wondered why I never understood or would settle for the simple solutions. For me everything always had to be complicated... or else it just didn't appeal to me... or I just didn't regard it as significant. Anyway... the point is... I don't understand why anyone would settle for anything just ok or fine when you, as superior and advanced human beings, are capable of accomplishing and doing so much greater than what you would normally settle for.

so.. school sucks... fucking band nerds are in most of my classes... i intend on killing them all. yea.. by the way. i have officially quit band.. jesus... band... *sigh. band used to be something so great and incredibly fun.. and now that the losers/geeks/freaks/gays have taken it over... it is nothing but a hellhole concentration camp run by dictator mauldin and his evil accomplices. so i quit. ugh... subject change... it saddens me to reminisce about band. 

classes... i want to say suck.. but i'm actually interested in the classes i'm taking this year so.. i'm goina go with alright as of now. macro... boring as hellll! jesus..! i attepted to read ch. 2 THREE different times and for some ungodly reason i fell asleep every time. but regardless.. franklin rocks. wishing i took fleming. hoping i passed eng. biology is goina make me faint in the near future when we start dissection. latin... bahh.. i am still very apathetic. so yea.. thats basically it.

yeaa... regarding my boyfriend... sry i didn't tell you guys sooner.. i didn't think you wanted to know or cared. but yea.. it became ""official"" that day.. so please don't think i've been hiding it from you or didn't want you guys to know.

WHO WANTS SOME BUDDHA?! (*raises hand... pick me!) 

this summer has been one crazy summer. school dictates my life... it's not fair. i have concluded that.. during this entire summer i have had only ONE ""sleep-in day"" (that would be the miraculous moment of waking up not by the annoying alarm clock or the insane mother screaming, but willingly.) so basically.. my summer is the weekend before school starts.. geez.. oh well. 

poker night!! mann... it's going to be soo awesome. tequilla and random jello shot making..

cardie's was funfuns! george's afterparty was kickass.. (except for that bad vodka.. eww)

ska fest, the quinns play at 9:00, at fitz's upstairs this friday! afterparty?! wootwoot!

keg party? ...what?

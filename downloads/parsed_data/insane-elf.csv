"event","Wow, it has been a whole year since I've updated this thing. But I figure I have the time and the will power to do it right now, so why not? Although I doubt anyone will actually read it. In fact, most of my friends have moved on from lj to Xanga and then on to Facebook. But never myspace! We hates it, precious! But facebook eats my brain (and spare time) in a good way. OM NOM NOM.

Now where to start? Where I left off I suppose.

My, the last entry was an angry one. Although rightfully so. It generally makes people mad when someone goes out to the mall and decides to shoot people because they are suicidal and want to go out with a bang. (Hah, bad pun.) My grandparents are not dead as the last entry might make it seem. Altel had a phone outage that day, and my grandpa never answers his cell phone or even bothered to set up his voicemail. 

Christmas is probably the next logical thing that happened, but I don't really remember much. I don't remember what I got or what we did, just that the mood was a little tense. The whole my mom vs. my aunt thing was pretty much the issue. 

Next event, my 18th birthday. Yay! I don't remember what I got, but I remember that my ice cream cake was delicious. 

In April there was prom, which really isn't as much fun as it's hyped up to be. I've had more fun at homecoming than Prom. Come to think of it, I've had more fun in a parking lot than I did at Prom. The car ride there was more fun, although a bit scary. We ended up in another state trying to get there as well as the bad part of town. They played too much rap for my tastes (which is a defined as any at all). But it was nice to see Holly crowned as prom queen instead of the Stu. Co members or the assorted skanks. Post Prom however, was way more fun. Although the decorating was subpar, I did steal a cardboard flying monkey with my AP Euro teacher's face on it. It's hilarious in a slightly disturbing way. The hypnotist was also hilarious. I've yet to see something funnier that a dozen guys up on stage under the impression that they are pregnant. Especially the one who upon being asked his opinion of it replied with, ""My mom's going to kill me."" LMFAO!

The month of May was definately action packed. Mother's day weekend was the Nebraska Renaissance Faire. It had been relocated to Bellevue Berry Patch this year, which is a interesting place. It was also the rainest day I have ever seen. With the exceptions of an hour or so of sunlight, it was a complete downpour the whole time. But did that stop me? NO! I stayed out there until I was soaked, went back inside to dry a little and went out again. Although the giant puddles and mud did stop me. I refused to cross one and was promptly offered a piggyback ride by a complete stranger. (Behold the power of cleavage.) One was so large that the next day they built a wooden plank bridge over it and called it Loch Ness. I got my mother a dagger as a Mother's Day present. Nothing says I love you like Mideval Weaponry. :D I also discovered the secret of my hair. The day where I was absolutely soaked, my hair decided it wanted to curl up really tight. It was pretty awesome looking for something that happened purely by accident. 

Next up was the Midwest Ren Fest, right over on Scare Acres. And it runs for two weekends, which was great because I was stuck working the first weekend. It was good fun, but I don't recall much other than learning the song ""Roll Your Leg Over"" and experiencing a second degree sunburn. OH! And that when the King laughs, he sounds like a Tuscan Raider from Star Wars.

Next big thing is graduation. Yay and boo at the same time! Yay as in I'm all done with that stuff and no longer have to deal with two-facedness of some certain people I am happy to never see again. But boo that it was all over with. Which now that I look at it, it doesn't make much sense. I guess I still have mixed feelings about it. I suppose I always will. At any rate, the actual ceremony was extremely boring and I learned how much I truly detest motorboard hats. Afterwards I went to go eat with my family and grandparents at Clancy's Pub and after that partyhopped. I ate a whole lot of cake that day. 

And I am really hungry right now. So I'm going to make myself something to eat. I'll continue this later. Maybe."

I'd kill that little son of a bitch if hadn't already blown his brains out. 
""Going out with style"". Mother fucker.

I can't get a hold of my grandparents. Though I don't think there were there, it's still unsettling. That guy has fucked everything up."

"event","<lj-cut text=""The ceiling leaks strawberry ice cream"">I had the weirdest dream this morning. It's kinda broken up since I don't remember huge chunks of it. I remember standing on a ladder under a hole in the ceiling where the tile had been removed. There was a tiger circling around on the ground and strawberry ice cream was leaking from the ceiling as well. Then the ladder gets knocked down and I'm left hanging from one of the bars that supports the tiles. Through the hole I can see someone. He's about my age and I tell him that he'd better pull me up or come down and set the ladder back up. He didn't want to face the tiger, so he pulls me up. Then I've somehow lost my clothes and the ceiling is filled with insulation. I remember feeling very itchy since I was naked on fiber glass insulation. And these guys kept popping out of the insulation and scaring the bejesus out of me. Eventually, I fell asleep in the insulation. Then there's a great big chunk missing from the dream. And then I remember that I was sitting on the top bunk of Ashely's bunk bed, reading a book (quite possibly a Harry Potter book, but I'm not sure), wearing overalls and I was about three or four months pregnant. Then Ashley's mom came in to tell me something and I was went, ""Oh, okay.""

As weird as some of my dreams are, that one's up there in the rankings of the trippy ones. I also had these weird dreams that I was being molested. One had the guy chasing after me because he wanted to kill me. He looked like a combination of Jack Nicholson, Gary Busey, and one of those creepy looking guys in the mail room in [u]Elf[/u]. At the end of the dream he fell off a tall building and died. But I and the other girls he had molested didn't believe he was dead, so we had him thrown off the building again and trampled. The other dream the guy that was after me was dressed like the Easter Bunny. </lj-cut>

On Monday, I had a get together with some of my friends. We made a little movie called ""Pickadilly and the Pirates"". It was really quite fun. We raided my closet and my sister's and found we had plenty of stuff to dress up like a pirate with and we found two uniforms my dad had from the Navy. We got them on without much trouble, but getting them off was another story. Those shirts were not meant for anyone with boobs. It was an adventure trying to get them off. And the pants, oh, the pants! Wool thirteen button pants should not exist. Period. I couldn't put them on over my pants, so I ditched them and put the pants on. Only after I had buttoned them up and taken about three steps did I realize that they were far too itchy to wear without anything underneath them. So I had to unbutton, put on some shorts, and re-button. But then I noticed I had missed the bottom buttons on either side and had to do it again. Then we went outside and filmed. It was amusing and it turned out pretty well except for one point when I'm there and then suddenly not. Perhaps we should film Ashley narrating why I disappear. I feel kind of bad that she was stuck operating the camera.

I'm going to mess with the editing again tonight; I realized that I'd deleted Nicole's name from the credits as soon as I showed it to her. I've lost/ don't have access to the original file so all I have to work off of is what I thought would be the finished product. I hope I can fix it without messing up the music and the dancing mime. 

Oh, it's snowing tonight. All our previous snow had just about melted since it was about 47 degrees out yesterday and Thursday. But now we've picked up about four inches. It's tapered off for the moment, but the weatherman says the storm's going to swing back around in the early morning and give us up to 10 inches or so. That's Nebraska weather for you. I'm glad. It's packing snow and we haven't had a chance to build anything yet. I think we're going to go out and build Snowhenge in the front yard tomorrow. I'm rather excited. It's got to turn out better than our last attempt, the snow Venus de Milo. She just looked like a big lump with a misshapen head."

You know what this says? That I needed to blog at least once a month and finish what I started. Perhaps I'll do that tonight. Or some other time 'cause I have knitting and sewing to do. I finished four pieces of knitting today at school. =D *excited face and accompaning spastic hand motions*"

"event","Oh my. It's been quite a while since I updated last and so many major things have happened. Let's go in chronological order, shall we? *whips out day planner*

<lj-cut text=""OMG! It's the emo journal entry that ate your friends page!"">
The first day of school was August 15th. All went well, at least in the sense that nothing particular stands out. Oh! But they did ditch the old ID policy. We no longer have to wear the ids as long as the security recognizes us. Which is great because my id and lanyard kept getting caught on things like my backpack and drinking fountains. 

Some where in the middle of August I got my first job. I worked at the daycare on the corner for a while. My overall impression is rather negative. Perhaps it's just the tendency to remember the bad over the good, but some of those kids are just little monsters. They don't share, won't listen to me and hit each other <i>and</i> me. The things their parents should have been cracking down on when they started. The only times these kids would help was when I was crying, and even then some didn't care. Don't get me wrong, not all of the children are so terrible. Some were so sweet I wanted to clutch them to my bosom and coo about how adorable they were. The worst is when they're both a pain in the ass and cute. It's so hard to stay mad at them.

Also in the middle of August, my mother had a mamogram which nothing was wrong with. But she finally decided to speak up and say, ""Hey guys, I've got a dent in my boob. Is it something I should be worried about?"" So they sent her to get an ultrasound and sure enough. A big tumor. She went in the day after as well so they could take a biopsy and a week later we got the results. It was cancer. She left a voicemail message on my cell phone as I had requested telling me so. It made me laugh since she sounded so cheery saying, ""Yeah. It's cancer. Umm...Bye!"" Alysha was laughing too, but Jessica didn't think it was funny. Perhaps I just have dark sense of humor. (Bunny Suicides!)

September 6th, Mom went in for a double mastectomy. Not really necessary, but she said she'd rather have no breasts at all than have one big one. Up until this point, the whole cancer thing hadn't really bothered me. I was cheerful and life went on as usual. My mom was grieving over it but she'd come to terms with it a while before the surgery. But I got to school and it hit me. Hard. I was fighting back tears all through first hour. I couldn't pay attention because I was trying my damnedest not to cry. I came into homeroom sobbing. Thankfully, there was only one other kid and the teacher in the room at that moment. And the teacher let me use his phone to call my grandma who agreed to pick me up. I waited in the office for my grandma instead of going to second hour. Ashley came up and waited with me. Bless her heart, that was so nice of her. If she hadn't of been there, I think I would have started bawling again. I did start crying again as I was walking out to the car with my grandma. And in the car. And in the garage. And while sitting at the kitchen table. I calmed down after a while since I could actually let it all out in one big go. I did some homework, but started up crying again around noon, when Mom was supposed to going into surgery. I called in and said I couldn't come into work. Around four o'clock I talked to mom. She was okay (although a little out of it) and she was back home the next day.

I wrote one big-ass research paper on stem cells. It required 13 different internet sources, 75 note cards and was 10 pages long, excluding sentence outline and works cited. All the work was worth it though. I got the paper back today and I got a 92%. 93% is the cut off for a 1. But I have the chance to make corrections and earn half my lost points back. So while in the computer lab today I hastily made some of the corrections, mainly fixing punctuation and formating errors and printed out a new copy. Now all that's left to do is highlight the changes I've made on the new copy and hand it back in.

On Tuesday last week I rented a cabin with five of my friends at the state park. Ashley's parent came along and it was good fun. We got everybody there, started a fire and cooked hot dogs over the fire. Then we went out for a night hike to the lake. We found some swings and bench, but that was all. Then we headed back and made smores and burned stuff. Nicole's phone went off about this time and there was a voice mail waiting for her. Jordan had tried crank calling her and left a message saying, ""Seven days"" in a creepy voice. But we couldn't understand her and thought she was saying pancakes. Thus a new inside joke was born. We watched the fire until it died down and we went inside. We popped some pop corn and started to watch 'And Now For Something Completely Different' but ended up stopping it and talking until two in the morning at which point we all moved into the bunk bed room and continued. At some point after 6:30 we'd all fallen asleep but were up again at nine. We all got dressed, ate breakfast and packed up our stuff. Then we locked up and went down to the 85 ft. observation tower. Oh man, was it cold up there, but a fantastic view. We checked the stables next, but it was too cold for the horses. So we headed for the waterfall. Well, it's not much of a water fall. I'm almost taller than it is. It sure is pretty though. Annie has some great pictures of it. After a little of horsing around in the woods and playing in the stream, we all packed in the mini van again and went home. It was some good old fashioned female bonding.
 
I quit my job at the day care as of Friday October 20. The reason being, ""My mother is starting chemotherapy soon and I can't bring home the germs."" Really what better breeding ground for illness than a place where several dozen four year olds are running about being free with their mucus. I also wanted to write in that the children are a nightmare, but I thought I <i>might</i> want to come back in summer if I have no other job offers. I'm glad to have a little more time to myself and with my friends after school. 

Monday, Mom had her first chemotherapy session. She felt fine the first and the second day. But by the third she was tired and had nausea. She still feels that way today.

We ran up and down the new set of stairs three times, skipped through the hallways, waved at the freshman in class, snuck a peek at the new restrooms and snuck up behind Mr. Stevens and wandered about the school. My legs are really tired.

It was strange, mainly because the baby was holding a syringe. It was nearly WTF inducing. 

I haven't been up to much lately. Just hanging around and such. I cleaned out my dresser and got rid of the shirts and shorts that no longer fit me/ are really ugly. I filled two large shopping bags just myself. I found the outfit I was wearing in my fifth grade picture. That just goes to show how long it's been since I've done that. It was hideous; it was yellow and covered with pink roses. I'm surprised I wasn't chased down by bees. It's happened before.

Oh yes, my mom wishes to throw a pirate party. And I, being the only the only person in the household with enough good friends to actually call it a party, get to play hostess. We'd probably just eat food and watch pirate movies. Pirates of the Caribbean, Muppet Treasure Island, Captain Blood, things like that. Yeah... I'm rather apathetic about the whole thing. It's just an excuse for us to get together and be silly and for Mom to wear her pirate coat."

<lj-cut text=""Attacked by Keanu Reeves in a Supermarket"">
It started out in a mall and I could see this guy in long leather jacket following me out of the corner of my eye. So I start walking faster. He follows. I get on an escalator, so does he. I start climbing up the escalator and pushing people out of the way. Once I'm off the escalator, I can't see him anymore. I'm starting to panic and fish three long brass screws out of my pocket and throw them into the doorway like that will throw him off or something. I rush outside and run to the nearest grocery store. Once in the grocery store, I seemed to have relaxed a bit. I'm walking down an aisle full of medicine, I believe I was looking for some Chloroseptic, when Keanu Reeves attacks me. He had been the one following me. He grabs me from behind and picks me up. Since my arms are pinned against my chest, I just start kicking and knocking all sorts of things over. I knock over a bottle of chloroform (WTF is that doing there?) and black out. All after that is rather random. I remember him giving me a piggyback ride and sleeping in a subway car. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Running from the government/living dolls"">
I was at the school library, sort of. It was dimly lit and made of several interconnected rooms with winding hallways. Two government officials are after me for some reason. I'm hiding in the library and trying to escape whilst finding my shoes. There's a lot of ducking into rooms and hiding. I manage to steal my shoes right from under the agents' noses. I run further back in the library to find elaborately decorated bedrooms. I find a side door that says 'Emergency Exit Only'. I open it anyway and an alarm sounds. I swear and look for another way out. I spot a ladder in the corner and climb up quickly since I can hear people coming. 

I find myself in a big Victorian house. Almost everything is pink and covered with lace. There is an old lady who live here with her son. I'm looking around with my sister, who is suddenly there, and we find a secret switch. The switch lifts up a wall to reveal a big window into another room. Inside are porcelain dolls, but they're moving and alive. The man finds us and locks us in the closet because we know the secret. But in the closet are all his plans and the way he said it. We never did get out of the closet though.</lj-cut>

Silly witch! Silly, silly, silly! There is a baby in the theater. The baby gurgles. The baby gurgles happily. The baby gurgles happily during tense moments. Watch the baby gurgle before the battle. Gurgle, baby, gurgle! Silly baby!

See Insane at Mimi's Cafe. See Insane's grandmother, mother and sister. Look at them eat. Eat, Insane, eat! Look at them become full. They all slightly resemble bloated ticks. Bloat, ticks, bloat!

""What ticks?"" asks Insane. Why the proverbial ticks, of course! Silly Insane! Silly, silly, silly! See them order a brownie to go anyway. 

Watch them go to Super Target. Watch sister spend Christmas money! Spend, sister, spend! Watch mother buy <u>Dodgeball</u> and panda toys. Pandas! Pandas! Do you like pandas? I like pandas. Pandas like to eat bamboo. I do not like to eat bamboo. The panda eats shoots and leaves. Insane eats, shoots, and leaves. Not really. Watch Insane gawk at good-looking security guard. Gawk, Insane, gawk! Insane has a strange weakness for men in uniform. Have you ever heard the story of the time Insane commented on the attractiveness of a mall security guard before he was out of earshot? 

Watch them go home. Watch mother drive. Watch mother be gasp at Green Day lyrics. Gasp, mother, gasp! Watch them go home.

Watch them watch <u>Dodgeball</u>. Look at them laugh! Laugh, Insane, laugh! Look at her imitate Steve the Pirate. Silly, silly Insane! Silly, silly Steve! Steve is not really a pirate. 

""No!"" says Insane. ""He be more of a pirate than ye'll ever be! Button yer lip ye scurvy narrator! Anybody who says otherwise be keelhauled!"" I do not want to be keelhauled. Do you want to be keelhauled? No? Repeat what I say. Steve is really a pirate. Pirates are real. Pirates tried to catch a cruise ship on the Barbary coast. Do you like cruises? Do you like pirates that attack cruises?

Hear Ashley call. Insane is happy. Why are you happy, Insane? ""Yarr! I be invited over to me friend's house!"" Watch Insane go to Ashley. Watch Insane crawl in a large box. Hear her giggle. Giggle, Insane, giggle! Watch them kick a soccer ball for an hour. Kick, Insane, kick! Insane kicks badly. Can you play soccer better than Insane? Of course you can.

Watch her go home. Watch her type. Watch her become frustrated. Look at her bang her head on the keyboard. Bang, Insane, bang! Watch her type out pointless blog entry. Blog, Insane, blog!"

"event","I had the strangest dream this morning.

<lj-cut>
It was all piratey themed. I strangly enough. I remember what everyone was wearing for part of it.

We'll it started out where a bunch of MS students were at my elementary school for some debate or performance of some kind. Well, we were supposed to eat lunch with the 1st graders. Adelle and Derek were there. And there were individual tables instead of benches. There was a whole section of tables empty near the cash register. Marty, the head kitchen lady, is operating the register. Adelle and Derek are sitting at one of the those empty tables. I sit down with them and say, ""Adelle, why'd you pick this table? It's in range of her whip."" Then Marty whips me, which she apparently used on those who talked too much and/or were not eating their Mac and Cheese fast enough. 

Then every one goes out to the playground and are suddenly dressed in piratey clothes. Corsets, buckle shoes, boots and bandanas, the whole nine yards. More people I recognize are there, like Ashley and Natalya. We're all running about and having fun until a pirate ship pulls up on the black top. (Suddenly theres an ocean in the middle of NE. I don't get it either.) Suddenly, English pirate women attack! (I have no idea what side Adelle is on at this point.) They're all wearing burgundy stripes. I don't know why. Ashley and I are hiding in the jungle gym until one of those English pirates comes in and calls us cows. Daring sword play ensues. I can't beat her and she can't beat me. So I just tackle her. I about have her pinned when I get up and let her up. She's ready to fight again, but I point to the pirate ship and cry, ""Look! They're taking our stuff!"" Sure enough the pirates were taking our things. So the English women pirates and the MS students band together and charge the male pirates on the boat, while the tide pulls it out to sea. 

Apparently the pirates on the boat knew this would happen and were prepared with rope handcuffs. They just kinda snap on and are really hard to get off. Some guys swoop down on ropes and scoop up some of the people before they can harm the ship. The handcuff everyone who they bring aboard and tie them to the rigging. I'm picked up and so is Ashley along with several others. They soon realize they can't keep everyone on the vessel because it will be too heavy. They take off Ashley and others and handcuff them to the jungle gym. They leave me on board. The tide keeps rising and I'm afraid they'll all be drowned. I start screaming for them to take me back and leave me with them. I can't stand the fact that I won't know if the people are alive or dead. They don't listen to me. I begin to cry and some young pirate comes over to comfort me. He looks like Bernard from Santa Clause. He hugs me and tells me it was all his fault; he didn't get the message to them quick enough.

We sail and soon end up in a place that looks much like the school I was already at except it's rearranged and empty. The prisoners, including me, are chained to the swing set. Bernard says ""the first to jump to the swing set in front will..."" I don't wait for him to finish and jump ahead. I'm thinking 'I'm free!' And jump off that set of swings, but the chains aren't long enough and I fall flat on my face. Bernard comes over and says that he can't let me go, until I sing the most unusual song ever, so that I may perform before the king. I've got nothing. I sit for a while in the sand, my head bowed and my hair in the sand. I find a seed which looks like a sunflower seed except it is all black and shiny. I bury it in the sand and put my hands over it and hope. It grows into a keyboard. I play it and thats when the dream stops. </lj-cut>

<strike>I'll finish tomorrow. Perhaps I'll dream something else interesting.</strike> Done!"

"event","Whee! Today was fun. I got back from Explorers a little while ago. Tonight was pulmonary lab and radiology. My dad works in as a Nuclear Medicine Technician, but we didn't see that. We saw the MRI machine but didn't go in. I was glad though. I worried that my cell phone or the snaps on my coat would be magnetic. Then we looked at some X-Rays of fractures and CT scans of them. They have one CT machine that takes 64 pictures per second. *impressed whistle*

Then we moved over to pulmonary and had a funny guy who showed us how to entubate. I already learned how to on Trauma Tuesday, but it was still interesting. In fact, when one girl tried it on the dummy he yell, ""You're killing him!"" and made her jump. It was rather amusing. Then I stole his trachea tube. =P It had a hole in the thing anyway. I gestured with it in my hand the remainder of the night.

When we were done, Ashley and I went back down to the cafeteria and grabbed some pretzels and water. And jogged around around the halls trying to avoid this guy who we ended up holding the elevator for any way. Then when we got off there was guy being wheeled past on a gurney. And we were thinking, ""Oh crap, we got on the wrong elevator.""  But the nurse pointed us around the corner and into the lobby. 

School was fun too. I got there a little early and talked to Jessica and Brittany. Then in Chemistry, my wish for a substitute teacher was granted. We went to a different guy's class and watched him make chemical reactions. The best one was Hydrogen Peroxide, soap and Potassium Iodide. It made foam. Ashley and I passed silly notes concerning exploding eyebrows and horse-drawn duck carriages. 

English was nothing special, but it was complete silence when she asked us questions.

Math had a new seating arrangement. I have a feeling many things will be flying over my head. 

World Geography was fun. Sedrek came and talked to us about Armenia, which is where he's from. We asked him questions all hour and did no work.  It was great. He even could something for us. He had to go through the paper work they now require after the hash brownies incident. 

After school was good too. Jessica demonstrated her neat gift that tells you what pitch you're singing. I have concluded Alysha has small hands and good-smelling perfume in her purse. Ryan informed us all that he does a really good fake orgasm. 

The End."

Well that was amusing. Some one sent the OPS superintendent a threatening letter with racial slurs. They showed the letter on the news with the slurs blacked out. I must say, I like their writings style. Especially their ""What in God's name do you think you're doing?"" line.

I really hope they don't take over our schools. I'll have no school to go to if they do. I live outside of the city limits and couldn't go to South anymore. West would be the only high school left in the district and that would be bursting with 3000 kids. It's crowded already. Ashley <i>does</i> live in the limits and would still go to South. I'd be split up from my best friend of 10 years. I have no idea about my other friends. 

This won't even bandage OPS problems. It's like putting a band-aid on a severed leg and saying, ""All better."" That band-aid coming from MPS's paper cut and then pouring lemon juice on it. 

My parents will have to pay for the bond issue and new bonds OPS will sure pass, I'll have no school to go to, and the quality of education will decrease...

<lj-cut text=""School"">I went to school on Thursday but felt terrible and stayed home on Friday. I'm nearly all caught up now. All I have is a lab to make up in anatomy, which I was <i>supposed</i> to do this morning, but I forgot. >.< And I was late anyway.

We started to dissect rats a couple of days ago. We looked at the digestive system first. We broke our rat's intestines. Oops. Then the reproductive system. Ours was difficult to find every thing on because our rat was a very young female. We couldn't find half the glands, because she wasn't fully developed yet. One group had a pregnant rat. We got to look at the embryos, but they weren't very interesting. Ashley got a pregnant rat whose babies were full term. It makes me sad to know that whoever we got the rats from killed the little babies. 

But then we went on and looked at the chest and finally went after the brain. Getting through the skull was the most disgusting thing ever. Just hearing it being done makes me shudder.

Everything else was pretty boring.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The Party""> After school on Friday I went to the mall with Brittany, Kaitlin, Jessica, and Ashley to look for homecoming dresses. We all seemed to find something we liked after a while. Although, I had to bribe Jessica to try on the first dress. I said I'd put on a skanky black dress if she did. I was true to my word and Brittany even put it on for kicks and giggles. Then afterword, we headed over to Brittany's house for her block party. Amy, Jenna and Derick joined us. There was a moon bounce which we occupied most of the night. Around 9 they started karaoke and hilarity ensued. We all wanted to sing except, Jenna, Amy and Kaitlin. So we were all first and we sang ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". We sang along with other people's songs too. Then Jenna joined us for ""I Will Survive"". My mom made me leave after that, but the rest of the group sang ""I'm Too Sexy"" and ""Baby Got Back"". I heard they choregraphed the last two but I didn't get to see the dance. Perhaps Derick will show me, 'cause he's fun like that. </lj-cut>"

Monday: It was okay. In chemistry we got signed into our book's website, so now I never have to haul it home again. Yay. And then she had us check out a book to read if we finished tests early and such. So because <i>Ashes of Roses</i> is insanely easy/stupid, I checked out <i>Bitten</i>. Yay for me. 

Then there was English. I'm really starting to detest English, but I think it's just Mrs. Killip. We have the same homework as Mr. Gould's class, because she doesn't want to make up her own lesson plan. I wish I had Mr. Gould instead. He sounds like more fun. 

After that I had Advanced Algebra, which is mildly entertaining. There was throwing of paper balls while the sub wasn't looking, to which the big guy responded by snapping the kids mechanical pencil clean in half. Then near the end of class, the substitute declared that if we needed help, he would be in the ""math lab"". Most everyone thought he said meth lab.

Then I had lunch. Oh, what a lunch it was. Some how we got around to talking Brittany about Aramark, our food service provider, and how they had raise lunch up a dime with no change in service or the quality of food. I told her their motto should be ""Aramark: Screwing over the little people since 1989."" Brittany somehow concluded that the little people were smurfs. That started a whole other conversation about how that was physically impossible to do and lead to making bad things out of her mashed potatoes to make my point.

Finally I had world geography. We had a test, but other than that, it wasn't interesting at all.

Tuesday: I stayed home sick yesterday. I had a fever that just wouldn't come down. So I slept in and finished my homework which I ditched the previous night to take a nap instead. Deidre stayed home too along with mom. Deidre now has pink eye and still has the remnants of the terrible cold she bestowed upon me. I mainly messed around on the computer the rest of the day. I had to call Jess to get vocab words, because I didn't have my book with me. She had a bunch of homework, so we had to hang up early. Oh well. I said I'd spam her inbox, which I'll do in a moment.

Today: Home sick again. But this time, no homework to do. Mom is at work and Deidre is at school. I hope she warned the teacher to make sure that she didn't touch her eye too much. I've had pink eye before, and I don't want it spreading to anyone else. My mom called to check in on me a while ago, but woke me up from a nap. So I decided to update like I'd meant to."

I saw my cousin in the West band and screamed for her too. If you couldn't hear me screaming I was over at the school across from the church on 133rd. I was hiding in the shade though. Thank goodness for the tree otherwise I'd have a sunburn. All it takes is 20-30 minutes in the sun for me to get a sunburn.

We didn't go down to the carnival part today, but will tomorrow. 

We went to the mall instead and got a picture frame, a new CD, and some cookies. My mom got a picture frame for my sister's and me's pictures. She felt bad because her picture of the dogs is bigger than our pictures. The CD is actually pretty good for a Radio Disney CD. 15 tracks on the CD; I like 14 of them. It has the Macarena on it along with Kung Fu Fighting. =P And some James Brown, Chubby Checker and M.C. Hammer on it.

Then in English we went to the library to get our indepent novel. It had to be fiction by an American writer. So we were looking through the books and I found <i>Bitten</i>! But it was by an English author. Curses. Foiled again. All the interesting books are by English Authors. So I ended up with <i>Ashes of Roses</i>. Some historical fiction about the triangle shirt fire. I secretly hope the main character gets to be one of the people they find melted together by the locked door after the fire is put out.

And I did very little of importance in Advanced Algebra. 

The main thing we did in geography was present the posters we made, based off this: http://www.luccaco.com/miniatureearth/miniature_earth.htm We made 13 starving stick people and 41 smelly people without basic sanitation.

But oh, the band room! There was much fun. At one point we were walking around Jessica and snapping our fingers like <i>Westside Story</i> while she played the tuba. Then the student teacher played her tuba with out the mouth piece. I danced with the student teacher and did other such fun things like spinning around, yelling that small children were kept in Red Sarah's back pack, and watching Mr. Meyer's shake Adelle and Jessica. Then Ashley and I scrambled out to the church, and on the way there disrupted the drama club meeting with a cry of, ""I will not repent!"". But we got over to the church and chased a butterfly in a squirrel-like fashion. Once we caught up with it, we cooed at it like so:

Ashley: You're so pretty, butterfly! Yes you are!
Moi: Yeah! You're not dingy like some of the other butterflies I've seen.
Butterfly: *flies away*
Moi: Did I come off too strong?
Ashley: *nods*
Moi: Maybe his hausband was dingy...

I came home to find that my sister was all better. No more fever and a new hoodie for me! Which was good, because I only fit into one of my hoodies any more. 

After dinner, we're going go grab a 'Millard Forever' sign to stick on the corner and a 'I <3 Millard' T-shirt."

It started out that I had found an egg somewhere and I decided to hatch it. I had the dogs sit on it for about fifteen minutes before my mom took it out. It wasn't hatched and then she tossed it to me. I, of course, dropped it and it cracks on the floor. I say, ""Awww, what a mess!"" But then the egg starts moving and out pops a duckling. Pretty soon it's a yellow fluff ball of cuteness and is following me around like I'm his mama. (It was the cutest thing ever!)

One day, me and my duck head over to an unidentified neighbor's house. This neighbor seems to have a hatred of ducks. And wants to kill/maim/eat my duckling. He seems like a nice guy and invites me in. I ask him if he has some worms and milk I can have. He's sure, but I look in the fridge and only find milk. I back outside to find my duckling missing. I look all over for him, but finally deduce that my neighbor took the duckling to his evil secret tree house like lair guarded by men dressed as pirates. 

I make my way there and proceed to sneak around the premises. The entire building is made of wood patched haphazardly together with weeds growing all over. There's several sets of stairs and rope ladders and in the middle of the building is a crow's nest. In the crow's nest there is a man wearing a red bandana, a hoop earing, striped tights, white shirt and vest. (This man was a performer at the Rennisance faire.) He keeps spotting me and pointing me out to his piratey cohorts. I have to duck and hide but he keeps seeing me. Eventually, I get into the building which doesn't have an overly complicated floor plan. I still have to play cat and mouse with the pirates. I wander into a sparse library and lo and behold, there is my duck! But I hear some one coming so I hide on one side of the doorway. A pirate comes through the door. I grab him around the waist and cover his mouth with my other hand. Other pirates come in and I use the pirate I'm holding as a human shield. I back out of the room with the pirate, then attempt a daring escape with my duck.

I put a blanket over my duck's head to keep him calm. At this point I suddenly remember I have super powers. Nothing really special though. I have jock powers or something, because I can run fast and climb fences while holding a duck. I do the said running and fence climbing until I get to a swing set. Instead of swings, there are motorcycles. Little motorcycles. I jump on a cool black one. I have trouble getting it started because my feet keep slipping off. My legs are up against my chest this thing is so small and I have a duck in my lap. I finally get it started and blast through a chain link fence and take off down the road."

"event","Okay. I'm lazy and I broke my promise to finish the dream entry. So you get a brief synopsis. Ashley and I proceeded to skewer the witch with pointed sticks and she disappeared. We robbed an elf of a silver pistol and later returned it. And gave CPR to two monks who hung themselves. (Oh the irony.)

Okay now to the proper update. Today was the first day of school so that warrants an update. I got to school and as soon as I stepped out of the car someone was screaming my name. It was Platinum Sarah! Well, she not platinum blonde anymore. But she didn't have to move. I didn't get to hear the whole reason why she got to stay because the bell rang. I didn't have time to put my stuff in my locker so I hauled it around with me. I got slightly confused when it came to the sign on the gym door, but I got to homeroom on time. We got our planners which are substantially cooler than last year. No need to mutilate the cover to make it better. 

First period, human anatomy, sounds like it will totally rock. However, we have no floor. The tile flooring has been ripped out because it contained asbestos. We're going to die of lung cancer. Yay! But the teacher seems really nice. I don't know anyone in the class, so I suppose I'll have to make some new friends. They seem like decent people. Mrs. Groth says we'll dissect a rat, sheep or pig heart, sheep brain, cow eyeball and perhaps a kidney. She also says we'll type our own blood and perhaps have CPR training. I already know it but, it couldn't hurt to hear it again. 

Then it's off to second hour, Athletic Training and Sports Injury. Mr. Holz, seems nice enough though a little strange. He's forcing us to socialize by making us sit with someone we don't know, which I suppose is a good idea since we'll end up touching each other. (I know someone will take that in the wrong sense.) Taping up fake injuries and such. 

Then off to Foods of the World. The floor is also ripped out which looks really nasty. Slosson told us to ditch the five second rule. I believe her. I do know someone there who did and will talk to me, Dana. I haven't spoke with her since our Girl Scout troop disbanded, so it was nice change. She's still as nice as ever. But on a sad note, I have first lunch and all my friends have near last lunch. So today I sat with a girl I recognized as Krista's friend. I asked to sit with her and she said yes. What followed was the most awkward lunch ever. I was more comfortable last year where there was some strange boy named Derick who asked to sit with me while I was alone. The almost the entire time Kayla was looking at me but not saying anything. Thinking there was something wrong or something I ask her,
""What?""
""I didn't say anything.""
""Oh. I must be hearing things.""

And that was the entire conversation for the whole half an hour. I'm used to a fun, vibrant conversation usually involving innuendo with bananas or taunting me about blushing in English last year. Rather bored, I headed back to class and wrote stuff about spatulas and egg beaters.

Then off to Spanish! The happiest class of the day! Mrs. Forehead is quite entertaining and officially has the best sense in seating charts. I can reach back and touch Red Sarah's desk without contorting in an odd fashion. Red Sarah at arm's length = note passing. And who sits behind me? Why Jacob Gruber of course! I'm thrilled about that and a little nervous. At least he won't kick my chair and give me reason to tie his shoelaces to the desk. Well that hasn't happened since 7th grade, but it would be amusing to have the opportunity to do it again. But Nicole's on the other side of the room. Ah well. But alas! No class is perfect. 'Know-it-all' Kroft is the class. He's like the Hermione Granger of the Spanish language. So much so, our class gave up and rode his coatails where Gauthier asked the class a question.

I didn't see Jessica after school to ask her when her lunch was so it made me sad. I should see her tomorrow. I went down with Ashley to unload my backpack into my locker. Suprise! Ashley has the locker right next to mine. While cool, she doesn't use her locker anyway."

I had a most awesome dream this morning. I was in my Renaissance costume through out the dream ands so was Ashley, except her's wasn't as flashy as it usually is. (I should probably put a picture once I figure out how to make entries friends only.)

I started out as both of us working as nurses in kind of fantasy setting. Like the Grimm Brother stories. The hospital looks like a big wooden building with hide covering the doo rframe. It had a steeple without a cross on it and sat at the top of the hill. I was asked to get something described to me as round and squishy. They called them by some strange name. I went and got three of them. They were just half deflated tennis balls. I have no idea what medical purpose they serve. 

I went out to fetch some more and had only gotten a few yards out of the village gates when absolute chaos ensues. Some one in the village is screaming, ""Vampire!"" Then a bunch of people are screaming it and running. I run into the village and make my way up to the hospital thing. On the way, I stop a few of the hysteric people and tell them, ""If there are vampires, why are they out in the daylight?"" They both ponder it for a moment before going back to screaming. I finally make it up the hill to the hospital and I stop with the rest of the crowd. There, floating in the air, is a witch. She's an old hag, no green skin though. I tell her to bugger off in short. When she refuses, I whack her with a stick. And tell her to burn in hell. She fades to transparent, screeching like something bad is happening to her. Suddenly, she solidified and said, ""Boo!""
</lj-cut>

I <i>will</i> finish this tomorrow. I promise."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Zombie Dream"">I had some strange dreams this morning. The first one I was working with the police on some case. I don't know what it was but we managed to tick someone off. They were driving down the street in a garbage truck with a bomb in the back. The police man took off in his car and I hopped in a semi without the trailer, turned left and put the pedal to the metal. I ended up driving through a coal mine. As I'm driving at full speed through the tunnels, zombies are popping out of the dirt and I'm just running them over like I'm mowing the lawn. At one point I drive through the men's locker room but, miraculously don't hit anyone. I'm milling over some more zombies when the tunnel collapses and everything goes black. I wake up in the dream in a hammock with a blanket over me. There's a hammock next to me with guy in it. He's says, ""Good morning."" I ask him where I am, but he doesn't answer and seems disappointed that I'm a girl. I'm thinking, 'Pffft.. Screw you then'. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Lex Luther:EMT Dream"">Then I had another, better dream. It started where I was in chorus and we had a woman teacher. (The woman actually does work at school, but I can't remember her name or what she does, but she always looks like she's eaten something sour.) Class was held outside and on a shiny, tin roof. We'd all climb up there, which was difficult. We'd slide off from time to time, before she finally said it was impractical and had us sit on the ground. But class was over and went to gym, which was also outside. We played soccer with the foam dodge balls. I ended up being goalie and sucking at it. On the brightside, I caught one which I promptly tossed at Brandon Banik's crotch. He doubled over, it was really quite funny. After that I was with several people in the chorus room and Marsden wanted us to march outside to the playground. I'm thinking, 'Oh no! I don't know how to march properly! I think I'm the only non-band kid here!' So I try to follow the best I can, but I fall behind. 

I eventually get outside to where every one is waiting. It rained while we were inside, so there were puddles and the sky was grey. It's a pretty basic playground. Sand, merry-go-round, jungle gym, pretty standard stuff. The playground is being used by several kindergarteners. Anna Hornback is out there looking in a puddle. I greet her and look into the puddle. In the puddle is a pair of small turtles. They were about palm sized. We both are thinking, 'Awww... How cute!' We begin to feed them worms and grubs, which they gulp down. Then Anna touches one and becomes very small and is in the puddle with the turtles. For a moment, I don't know what to do, but then I try to pull one of the turtles off her. I grab a leg which feels remarkably similar to a marshmellow. Anna manages to get a breath and I pull her out and bury the turtles with sand. I tell her to stay there while I go look for someone who can make sure she's ok. I rush in side, heading for the room where Ashley and Jessica are, so they know. On the way there, I pass a cute guy who says ""Hi, I'm Eric,"" and smiles. I smile in return but hurry on. For some reason it doesn't seems to register that Eric is an EMT, and exactly who I need to check out Anna, despite it saying so in large letters on his shirt. 

I end up in the room with Ashley and Jess. There are two people removing a boy on a strecher. I'm about to ask her what happened to him when we notice who just passed by the doorway. Lex Luthor. In scrubs. Ashley asks, ""Was that-?"" 
""Yes. Yes, it was."" </lj-cut>

You know if I'm ever in a canoe again I'll be singing, ""Hammer of the Gods! We'll drive our ships to new lands. Fight the horde, singing and crying, 'Vahalla, I am coming!'. On we sweep with threshing oar. Our only will be the western shore!"" And make myself look silly in other ways. 

I had I dream yesterday involving Jessica, the grocery store and a buffalo nickel, which I may or may not tell you about tommorow."

Well went to the zoo yesterday and tramped about for a good three hours. We had to jog through the Kingdoms of the Night because Mom became all claustrophobic while I was gaping at all the bats flying around. 

Then today I donned the ugly yellow ambassador shirt and headed over to school and give tours to freshman. I have to admit I got lost a couple of times myself. Ashley and I kept taking breaks because it was so hot inside and my shoes hurt. We paused in the 400's so I could take off the shirt I was wearing underneath. We were sitting in the hall until a teacher came out of his room and promptly went back in when he saw we were out there. We scurried off after that. We were up in heaven for a little bit, it was nice and cool and well out of the way of people touring, but it smelled like floor wax. Then we helped people a bit more before sitting in the back hallway over by 118. Well, Ashley sat and I laid on the floor. Hey, it was nice and cold, you can't blame me. We talked for a while before giving more tours and confusing some freshman's parents. Then we stopped in the musicplex and took off our shoes. I saw Mrs. Baker talking to drama students or something, probably cast for 'Oklahoma'. She is most definitely pregnant.

Oh, yes I almost forgot. Ashley stuck me in a box and left me for a while but I didn't know so I kept talking. When she came back I was sitting under the box singing, ""I'm so lonely."""

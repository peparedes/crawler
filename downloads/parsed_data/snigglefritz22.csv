"event","So here's the thing. I am an extremely sarcastic person. I also don't deal with uncomfortable situations well. I either laugh loudly, to break the mood, or I stare at my feet and pretend I'm not listening, when I still am. And I always give advice when no one wants it. Therefore, I am always worried that what I do offends people. I mean, ALWAYS worried. Not just a little either. It's why I don't have a lot of relationships, why I'm the plucky comic relief, and why even now, I sit here typing, alone. I don't want to be alone anymore. But it seems to me that there is no other way at this point, because I can't read people, especially in uncomfortable situations. Maybe I am just...you know, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't. I'm done."

Almost.

So I had two exams today. The first was in psychology, and it only took 20 minutes. I was like, wtf mate? But whatever. That means I'm done with that class forever. FOR-EV-UR. Oh yes. The other exam was in German. It took me an hour, and I was the second one done. I'm willing to bet a lot of them were there til the end. But, I got all excited because there was one section we had to read and respond to, which was a page long...and I understood every word of it! Go me. It was about the guy that voices the Harry Potter books on tape. He did over 100 voices for them. I was like WOW. But yeah...I should have taken it with me, it was interesting.

Two more exams...I'm almost done.

Last night at 12:30 the power went out in all of the residence halls (except the Towers) and some of the buildings. Apparently there was a down wire. As soon as it went out, these girls in my wing started screaming down the hall. I was like, yes, it is fact: you're morons. A girl in the other wing told me her neighbors across the hall started screaming aout terrorism, packed up a bunch of shit, and left. I was like WOW. Amazing. As my battery was full, I spent the time playing this Tetris game I found online for free. That game sucks. Once you get to a certain point scorewise, it says OVERLOAD and closes.

"event","So, today in physics, my teacher was discussing exactly what X-Rays are. (We're doing the light spectrum.) He was explaining E=mc2, saying that mass times the speed of light squared equals the amount of energy. Ok. So, he mentioned the atom bomb...you know, the one that hit Hiroshima during WWII? Well, that had the mass of a Post-It note, and yet it vaporized an entire city block where it hit, destroyed the city, and its radioactive remnants are still causing leukemia and the like. Then he said, ""Now, imagine this bomb that we created in the 40's if it had one kilogram of mass. That's what we make now. It would vaporize Ypsilanti.""

It's an AIM virus. This happened with my cousin once too: the virus maker sends you a message as someone on your list, and convince you to download a file. Usually, it begins a new conversation. If they don't respond, it's not them. (FYI: The file was a MS DOS file, not a picture. I mean, obviously it's not a pic, it's a virus, but make sure you look at what kind of file it is...)

"event","So, I hauled Basey up that hill, and nearly died, but it was ok. My chest still hurts, but it hurt just walking up the hill for German. I suppose the two Thanksgivings and the overexposure to cats did me in...

I had said last week (well, two weeks ago) that I did NOT want to do my physics presentation after these two music majors, Amy and Chris, who were going to duet on trombone and french horn. They're seniors, and I was like, ""Dude, haven't played in months!!"" Amy's last name starts with A, so they went first. And did really well. They pretty much said everything I could have said. As a side note, Amy's trombone is GORGEOOOOUUUUUS. It's like, twice as nice as Kyle's jazz horn, and THAT was about $3000, I think he said. Dang.

Anyway, right after they go, Jesse goes, ""Ms. DeLong."" Cock-juggling thunder cunt! [heh, see Blade Trinity] So, I go up there, and I played a really simple version of Russian Sailor's Dance and just reitterated what they had already said. So, I get done, and Chris goes, ""Why aren't you in band?"" I explained my dilemma, and he's like, ""You can try out for Symphonic Band at the beginning of the semester. I'll take you to Boerma, he'll give you correct information..."" So, my lab partner, Amy, Chris and I walked over to Alexander, and I met this guy. He seems cool. Apparently, the try-out information will be posted in a week and a half or two weeks, right before finals start. And, my lab partner, Sam, had stopped playing her oboe, but she decided she wants to play again, so she's going to go with me to sign up. I guess they take everyone, so I'm not nervous. Plus, Chris and Amy seemed really impressed, just by that little bit I played. I just want to play. I'm excited that I'll get to again.

On another note, I said I was going to take a nap, but I might wait a little bit. I'm still tired, but...I don't know. Now I'm not AS tired, because I'm in a good mood. I guess.

Anyway, peace out."

Now, I'm not gonna lie: I never liked Eddie's wrestling character. But, I'm watching RAW right now, which is a tribute to Eddie. And it's one of the saddest things I've ever seen. You don't see Chris Benoit cry. You don't see Triple H cry. You don't see 7'2"" Paul Wight cry. It doesn't happen. But, it is now. Booker T, Kurt Angle, Rey Mysterio...seeing them cry is sooo depressing.

Hahaha...they just showed a clip of Eddie spraying the Big Show with semen...that's awesome.

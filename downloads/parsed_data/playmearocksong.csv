Oh man, it was the BEST week ever. I don't
think I've ever had that much
fun on a vacation. 

The family reunion part wasn't too
bad. I'm so glad Daniel was there.
We had to go to this
thing on a naval base and, well,
let's just say I'll never be doing
that again...

Then we drove up to San Francisco.
We drove up the coast and it was
amazing. My step-dad is a very
distracted driver, so that
proved to be nerve wracking, but
we're all alive. For now.

Our suite in Marin was so nice.
It was a converted apartment complex,
so we had 2 rooms and lotsa space.
The weather was awesome, and I did some
MAJOR shopping. Major. Seriously. 

Daniel came, and I wouldn't have
had half or even an eighth of the fun
I did with him. He took me on a date
in the city to an Indian restaraunt and he
bought me new sunglasses. <3 Yah, best 
week ever. 

I'm glad to read that everyone had so much
fun at Peer Camp! I was worried for you guys,
but I'm so excited that it went well! Can't
wait to see you guys."

i love watching my niece...she's
way cute. seriously. but she's
teething...can we say attitude?

i haven't seen molly or
jessica much. a lot of that's
my fault for being so pooped
when i get home from work. but 
that's not a good enough excuse for
not hanging out with my girls.
we have a date ladies. be there.


everything's going great with
dan. he's coming with us to our
family reunion (god help him) and
after that we're spending a week
in san francisco. i can't wait. it's
going to be awesome. we got a 2 bedroom
suite just outside of sausalito. i have 
to sleep on the couch and john
gets to share the room with dan...unfair?
i think so...haha. but i don't think the
folks would go for ""katie and dan bonding
time in the same room at night"". yah..not 
gunna happen. oh well. 

ok, well i'm at work now and it's boring.

i'm going to look at pier 1 for
cool ideas for my room. we just finished
painting it this weekend and now it's
time to decorate!! i should call queer eye
for the straight guy. they rock. 

if you want to see my beautiful

school is over in 4 days. that's it.

i can't wait for this summer. i have
a feeling it's going to be awesome. molly
will be home, family vacation with dan,
2 jobs=more money towards a car, and i only
have one more semester of high school to suffer
through. sweet.

our one year is on july 7th. <3

so tuesday i don't have to go to 
school. my mom said that if i didn't 
have finals that day, i could skip
school and go to build a bear with her
class. and i'm going. i bet you're jealous.
haha...jk

i got to see jessica the other night
at panza's birthday deal. i missed that girl.
i'm optimistic that there will be LOTS of hanging
out this summer. and it WILL rock.

i need to tan my milky white legs.

is ""what's that"", but it's still cute.

i went over to daniel's for dinner last night. we talked about school and college and it really got me thinking about what i want to do. i know i have some time before i figure it out. but the faster the months go by, i realize that i am going to be a senior before i know it. i think i'm going to take the career placement test they are offering here. that might help a little. anyone got any ideas of what i could be?

i'm really excited about things right now. i don't think i can say enough how thankful i am that God put daniel in my life. he's always got advice to offer and love to give. there's something inside of me that tells me this is right. 
anyway, i've grown closer to some friends lately too like panza, laura, jamil, katy and meghan. i think retreat helped out a lot. i'm so optimistic about life right now. God is working amazingly through me and around me. 

molly, jessica:  I MISS YOU GIRLS!!!!!!!!

this saturday, i have this choir thing at maryvale high school from like 6:45 in the morning to 6 in the evening! my performances are really spaced out too, so i can't come late or leave early! suck-fest.

last night, laura, mike, nick c. squared and meghan came to visit me at work. we made fun of the american idol auditions. it was great fun. then daniel called and said something about a chinchilla in a really thick accent, and i mistook him for this little old italian man that came in earlier. haha..woops.

my family and daniel are going to gardunos for dinner tomorrow night. mmmmm...can't wait to see my love!

molly, i really hope your throat feels good. i'll come over as soon as i can where i won't get you sick! <3

so anyway, we had a ""family meeting"" on saturday morning. what a shitty way to start a weekend. blah..basically, my parents think i'm not a ""participating member of the family"", yet they are SOO proud of me for being involved elsewhere...umm? anyway, things have gotten better since then, and i think we all understand what each other is feeling. let's just hope there's no need for another one of those soon.

i get to go up north for the retreat a day early. we leave friday afternoon and i can't wait. we'll have the camp to ourselves for a whole night until the participants come. about 15 of us are going and i think it'll be a good time to get our stuff in order. wahoo!

my parents keep talking about the family reunion in july. i think they're excited..haha. daniel is coming (if he can get the time off of work) and that makes my heart sing. we get to spend a week in san francisco!!!! mmm, i love it there. it'll be swell.

The next day at 8:45am there is a knock the Personnel Manager's door.The Foreman from the assembly line throws open the door and begins to rant about the new employee. He complains that she is incredibly slow and the whole line is backing up,putting the entire plant behind schedule.The Personnel Manager decides that he should see this for himself so the two men march down to the factory floor. When they get there the line is so backed up that there are Elmos all over the floor and they're really beginning to pile up. At the end of the line stands the new employee. She has a roll of red plush fabric and
a big bag of marbles. The men watch in amazement as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles and begins to sew the little package between Elmo's legs. The Personnel Manager bursts into laughter. After several minutes of hysterics he pulls himself together and approaches

so friday night, our choir at school went caroling and we hosted it at our house. at our meeting on wednesday, like 25 kids said they were coming. how many people showed up? 9. that's it. 9 whole people. and out of about 12 officers, 4 were there. i really like how we schedule things around people and the officers who are supposed to be present, don't show up. that's really responsible of people.

anyway, the rest of this weekend has been awesome. daniel and i went to the library for a while and got some world music cds. mmmm. his hammered dulcimer came in on monday so he's been playing around on it all week. it's so awesome. everyone should check it out.

ok, this week has been really good. short week, 
one midterm, poetry writing and 
2 nights of work, and since i 
work at the church, that means i've 
been hanging out with all mah friends and 
having lots of deep conversations with ""momma"". 
plus, tomorrow is FRIDAY. 

friday=weekend. weekend=people. people=fun.

im ready for fun. anyone else?

im writing a poem for my poetry 
portfolio in english. i want some feedback. 
i'll post what i've got written so far. 
let me know what you think!

.:music:.

   The hum brilliantly stokes
the air. It hurriedly makes
  its way to an enduring
    listener. The radiant
colors of sound are beheld
  by welcoming eyes and 
woven into pleasing patterns.
  A sensation, unfamiliar to 
my veins, courses througout
  and makes home in my heart.
 A conclusion is drawn.
    Quick am I to embrace
the lingering melody.


that's all i've got. what do you think?"

after the workday, daniel came over and then we all went to manuel's for my mom's bday dinner. my brother is a spaz. he was drawing pictures of dan and i with captions. the picture was us kissing and the caption was:
Katie: ""OH DAN!""
Dan: ""I'm the muscle man."" (? don't know what that meant)

then there were thought bubbles and dan's was ""i have poor taste in women."" that kind of made me feel bad, but oh well. he's a dumb little brother. what can ya do?

nick's birthday party was last night and i had a good time. i got to talk to my sweet jessica. i've lost her to school. dumb ASU. laura and meghan and katy and mike got to come to. it was fun sitting by the pool talking to them. nina came. i was so glad. she's sooo amazingly nice.

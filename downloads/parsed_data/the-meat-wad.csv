"event","Hey everyone, garth and i got back together after two days of ""taking a break"" that was pretty pointless... but hey, it was expirimental. This entry won't be very long, but, i figured that that was crucial information for those of you who keep track of my life through my journal... or something crazy like that.

Some dude gave me a horse. He just picked it out of the field and gave him to me. It was sweet!! His name is Geymini (pronounced Gemini) and he's a pure bred arab."

"event","Sorry to everyone who reads this, it's mostly just me complaining about random stuff. This entry is about my break up with garth. Turns out, even though it's only been 2 days since i've seen him, i feel completely worthless just knowing that he's not with me anymore. I must just be really, really desperate because he seems like he doesn't even want to talk to me, let alone get back together eventually. Really, i must suck ass at being a girlfriend, i mean hell, i love him to death and he doesn't give a damn. I don't even think he bothers to read my journal anymore. That's his option though i guess, so, whatever. I still go to his website now and then to check up on the guestbook and see if anything new is going on, but, there's hardly ever anything i haven't read before. Why do i give a damn about someone who doesn't give a damn about me? Because i'm a pathetic human being, that's why."

"event","God damn, there is this kid that is so hott that i'm going to dedicate this entry to him. He is SERIOUSLY the HOTTEST guy i have ever seen, that includes celebrities too! He is going to make some beautiful babies some day. About a week ago i saw him without his shirt on and he was so gorgeous i couldn't look too long or else i'd probably cry because i wouldn't be able to touch him. He's kinda tall and skinny, but he has a GREAT stomach/ he looks great with no shirt. I've had so many dreams about him that he rocks my world through dreaming alone. I mean, i've actually orgasmed in my sleep dreaming about him. He has brown shaggy hair and wears his pants so his ass (boxers covering) hangs out... god it's lovely. HAHAH.... If only he knew...."

"event","I knew things were definitly going down the shitter today at the horse show when at first i didn't see garth there (he said he would go) and i started to get upset. Then he showed up, but when i gave him a hug and a kiss he showed absolutely no emotion at all, like he didn't miss me or anything. I don't know, maybe i'm crazy but i think it was right of me to get the vibe that i care about him WAY more than he cares about me. So i lived through the show (we sucked) and everyone could tell i was upset afterwards. I thought at that point that garth was acting pretty normal, like he actually gave a damn about me being upset. He hugged and kissed me and held me while i was on the brink of tears (i didn't cry then) as i was waiting to load merlyn back into the trailor. After all of that drama, i went with garth so he could give me a ride back home. In the drive way, i asked again if he could come over tomorrow, and all he said was ""I think I just want to stay home and do nothing"". Well god damn, i see how i rate. Especially since i only see him twice a week if i'm lucky nowadays. It's total bullshit. His mom hates me, i can tell. She doesn't act like it but i know she does. Why wouldn't she? I'm with her precious little baby. God fucking damn it. Their new car is sacred and can't stand to be driven to franklin and back, in spite of the reason for having cars in the first place in that they are for DRIVING. They're not limited natural resources or anything, i mean, it's not going to die out or anything. But anyways, he said he just wanted to stay home and do nothing, which (under the circumstances) upset me very much. I called him at about 1:30 am and i just wanted to spill some of the stuff i'd been thinking. After talking for about an hour, we broke up. Yes, everyone, the wonderful, almost-11-month relationship is over. Apparently we're just ""taking a break"" but who knows? He can get someone new if he wanted it.... and let's face it, there are tons of girls out there who are a million times more attractive than i am. I mean, as far as physical appearance goes, i'm lacking. I don't really have any talents either. So yeah, as of now, i am single. Maybe the hott Josh kid will show up on my door step begging for sex... either that, or i'll just be alone for a while, again. I can't believe he let me down, but, i guess we let each other down in a way. Our relationship failed, so, maybe this ""break"" can save it again. I hope so. I love garth with all of my heart and i never wanted this to happen. He means the world to me. So yeah, i'll say it again, i love the one person i've just let go. Doesn't make sense? It doesn't to me either. God damn, i'm crying like an emo kid. None of this makes sense. I wonder if he got the private post i left on his website a while ago. He's going to feel really bad when he reads it if he hasn't already."

"event","Yo everyone, i'm at Vicki's house and i'm extremely bored. Oh well. They made me pass out earlier and it felt like i was gone for about 2 years... it was INSANE! I woke up and didn't know where i was. We tried to do it to Steve too, but we couldn't push hard enough. Oh well. I got $5 for doing it, so, it's all good. Meredith is reading over my shoulder right now, and i really don't care because she's hott. ""Woohoo"" says Meredith. hahahahaha.... I love staying at Vicki's, even though we never do much. One time we chased each other around with nasty plungers, but, that's about as eventful as it gets when we're not out riding. I have a horse show tomorrow, and i'm kindof nervous, and although i know i won't place in anything, it's our district qualifier so it IS time to get a little more serious. Garth might get to come out, and if he does i'll shit my pants in excitement because i miss him a lot. I'll run Merlyn (my horse) right up to him and jump off and hug the air out of his TINY BODY... mwahahah. I love him so much. I know how much you guys who read this love my sappy entries, so, there ya go. I'm also hoping to see Nathaniel (maybe Courtney too), Jim, and Kelly at my show... maybe Meem (my gramma) too. Even though it probably bores the crap out of them, it really makes me more confident/makes me enjoy myself more to see that they support me. Steve and Meredith might make an appearance but after tonight they're probably going to be sick of me..... i mean, damn, i just met Steve and this is the 2nd time i've spent about 24 hours straight hanging out with him. Not like that's a bad thing though... he's one cool guy. SOOOO that's the end of my entry"

"event","WOW, this will make a great story for all of you readers! Something FUN actually happened to me throughout yesterday night and earlier today. I usually don't do anything that my dad wouldn't approve of, but damn, anyways... this is a good story. To keep things in perspective, I'll explain what's been goin' down for the past few days.

Okay, a couple days ago my friend Meredith and I decided to hang out with this guy we met through our friend (or acquaintence?) Kyle. They're in a band together called Remora Deign. Anyways, this guy's name is Steve, and he's the drummer. I totally thought he'd be really quiet and there'd be a lot of awkward moments throughout the time we hung out with him, but there were NONE! It was like, I was making a friend or something. That hasn't happened in a long time. Mer and Steve and I had a kickass time that day (I thought so anyways) even though we really didn't even do much. We hung out at his house for a while looking at his demented cat ""Leany"" (god that was hilarious) and sat around a graveyard for a while and just sort of talked. Later we went and got icecream and headed over to Kyle's house to meet up with him and my boyfriend Garth. When we were walking up the driveway, we heard Garth screaming at the top of his lungs, which frightened me. They were just being jackasses though. It was pretty funny. So, I parted with Meredith and Steve and Kyle to go to Garth's house for a while and that was the end of it for that day. 

Okay, another day went by that included me sitting around, not showering, and just watching tv. The NEXT day though, I hung out with Meredith all day, we went to the mall, made some pudding pie etc. and then just ended up at her house. Steve called her house after a while since we'd been trying to call him for a few hours before that, and he went over to Mer's house to hang out with us for a while there. We got kindof bored and Mer's whole family (plus more random people) were there so we went to my house. Mer was only going to be able to stay until midnight, so, we just decided to call Mer's mom and tell her that she was going to spend the night. My dad actually knew that SHE stayed over, but he had no idea that Steve stayed over night too. My dad was in the other friggin room! Steve had to sleep in the corner behind my couch, it was so funny. I couldn't stop laughing and it woke my dad up, so, we had to play some music and watch TV and throw stuff at Steve just to prevent/cover up the fact that he snores INSANELY LOUD. At one point, I actually resorted to pegging him in the face with a beanie baby. It made me very nervous around the second hour that my dad was awake and moving around our house. My house isn't very big, so, a lot of the time he was up he was actually in the room that Steve was sleeping in. It was so friggin cool! WE GOT AWAY WITH IT! It was about 7am whenever I could wake up Steve and tell him that he could come out and sleep somewhere that wouldn't contort his body into the shape of a boomerang. (He also moans in his sleep, did I mention that?) But anyways, yeah, we slept in until about 2 and then ordered a pizza once we were fully aware of what was going on again. God, today rocked. I HAVE THREE FRIENDS NOW! w00t w00t. That's the end of my entry, hope you liked it."

"event","Hey.
First of all, i want to apologize for writing about Garth ""blowing me off"".... he really didn't. I was just mad. It wasn't his fault he couldn't see me, it was mine because i refused to go to his house. He's an awesome boyfriend and out of anyone up here (obviously) he makes me the happiest. I love him lots.
As far as all of the depressing stuff that i wrote about, sorry if i bored you with it, but i think it was a result of my cabin fever. I really just needed to get out and do something. I'm going to start trying a little harder to be happy with what happens to me.
My friends in Clarion have shown me so much support lately and they really make me feel wanted again. I'm going to Clarion to go to Kim's house and swim in the river for a while, and i'm super-stoked for it. I need to pay more attention to my Clarion friends because they're the only people who have been able to be there for me through all of my endeavors thus far.
And to everyone who reads my journal- I really appreciate your posts. Anthony, you really surprised me with yours, i don't even know how you'd find out i have an online journal in the first place. Caitie, i miss you."

"event","Yeah, I know, this is my second entry today. What can i say? I don't have much of a productive life anyways. Have you ever had one of those days when you look in the mirror, and you think ""Damn, I'm ugly""? That seems to happen to me a lot. I call days like those ""Bad face days"" because, ""Bad hair days"" as a title just doesn't seem to cover it. Well, i woke up, and looked in the mirror today and thought ""God damn, you are one ugly mother fucker."" As the day progressed and i began to feel shittier and shittier, realizing how alone i ALWAYS am, i realized that today isn't just another Bad Face Day. I think today is a Bad BODY day. I hate the way i look. It didn't help whenever i decided (for some unknown reason) to turn on MTV and see what was on. My advice: don't watch MTV because usually it will make you feel very, very ugly. I don't know how they do it. People like Jessica Simpson and Tara FUCKING Reid (grr), even Avril Lavigne (god, she's annoying) manage to look perfect ALL THE TIME. I mean, there are some days that i think i look sort of good, only to get shot down the next time i turn the TV on. I think that's why i watch cartoons so much. Busty, blonde girls in their fucking hip huggers and spaghetti strap tank tops, complete with loads of eyeliner and plenty of mascara, topped off with a Valley-girl, ditzy accent, yeah, girls like that make me want to shoot myself. Yet, somehow a part of me wishes i could look that good and be happy being that ignorant. Sometimes it makes me think that i could actually pull it off whenever i try to make Garth a little happier. I haven't really been doing a very good job with that lately. He says i'm beautiful and everything, which is great, sometimes, but sometimes it just makes me feel like people in general only say things that other people want to hear. It can't really be true, i mean christ, he could get girls 57893467X more good looking than i am. I could blame it on genetics, but, i can't really think of anyone in my family who is outstandingly ugly. My mom looks like she's still 26. Maybe my mom and my dad just don't mix well. I mean, we all knew that, i was just talking about physical appearance.... mixing their personalities would be like introducing a house cat to a family sized swimming pool.
On to other things. That thing i wrote about my friends in my last entry? Yeah. Forget about Gina, she just blew me off. If there's one thing i hate it's whenever people hang up the phone on me. God damn. I'm not DAWN, Gina. Oh well. Have a great summer sitting in your room talking to random people on the internet all day by yourself. Just be glad you have Kelsey or you'd sure be fucked whenever it comes to having real friends. I suppose you might make some fake ones if you keep posting those slutty looking pics on your website all the time though. Yeah, that's right, she's uses the fact that she can re-touch photos and the fact that she has huge boobs to get people to talk to her. So go ahead, Gina, go on more dates with the random, college 20-something-year-old guys you meet on the internet, it really makes you look smart. You're my hero."

"event","Hey everyone who reads this. Can someone please tell me how i'm supposed to use this site? I really have no idea how to just view my journal and read comments people have made on my entries.
Anyways. I've come to the realization that i'm not really a happy person. All of my friends are at least an hour away, excluding Meredith, Jim and Gina. Maybe i'll make some new friends here someday, perhaps just in time for me to go off somewhere far away again for college. Point is: most of my real friends are in Clarion and it's my fault i don't see them hardly at all anymore. Truth is, i don't really think they give a damn either way. Maybe Vicki and Kim do, but that's about it. Sorry i'm just complaining. Wait, no, i'm not sorry, you're reading this out of YOUR free will. Unless you're tralfamadorian, then, you're reading this, you always HAVE been reading this, and you always WILL be reading this. But of course, that's not real. 
I need to stop being such a pessimist.
I can't do it. I just tried. My friend Braden tricked me into doing HIS chores (feeding ALL of the animals where i keep my horse, including 8 horses total, 2 pigs, 3 goats, 1 dog, 1 steer, 1 rabbit, and 3 calves) while he got to relax, and then go to the horse show that I (emphasis on I) told him about previously, whenever i could've gone with him if he would've left me a message on my answering machine. I guess that's too hard, seeing as all he would've had to say would be ""Hey Courtney, we have a way to the show, call me back."" Holy fucking shit. That made me very angry. 
I'll stop being a pessimist for a little bit.
Gina might be coming up in a little bit, depending on how long her optometry appointment takes. I hope she can come up. I feel hopelessly subordinate to the feeling of boredom that always accompanies summer in my house. Damnit, i'm being a pessimist again. OKAY. Enough of that.
I might get to take Merlyn (my horse) to my friend Vicki's house before she moves, so that should be fun if it ever pans out. The last horse show that I took him to with Vicki and Kim was a blast, even though Merlyn and I still kindof suck at everything. We got 5 ribbons.... i can't complain.
Well, i'll have more complaining to do at a later date."

"event","Recently, a friend of mine made an online journal entry of her own on the experience she had with losing her virginity. Of course, since she IS my friend, i'm not going to post her name or any contact information on here. Well, here's he situation: she had been dating this guy for a while a really, REALLY long time ago, and didn't talk to him for a really, REALLY long time. Dig? Well, all of a sudden she's ""in love"" with him all over again, and decides ""Hey, it'd be cool to have sex with this guy and write about how glamorous it is in an online journal!""..... wrong. That's not cool. Especially since you're not even with this guy, friend, that's extra trashy of you. Usually i just try to be there for you to talk to about all of your life's problems, but not this time. You're being a baby and you need to knock it off. You know what got me about this entry though? It didn't seem TOO horrible until i started to read all of the comments people have made on it like ""OMG i'm so proud of you!"", ""I'm so glad your first time was so magical!"", and ""That's amazing, I hope my first experience is half that good"", and ""I know you'll find a way to make it work with him."".... sorry, but (certain friend of mine) that's NOT a good thing. Are you guys crazy? ENCOURAGING her to sleep around with a guy she hasn't talked to in years!? You must really be pretty easy to have done that. I hope you're proud of yourself, god knows i am. Come on? The first DAY!? Jesus Christ you're being an idiot. Sorry to let you down, but, when he said ""I love you"" as he was fucking the shit out of you, he probably didn't mean it. I'm sure there are other guys that lie about that sort of thing to get laid. The moral of the story: you're a fucking idiot."

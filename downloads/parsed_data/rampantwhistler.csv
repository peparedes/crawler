"event","FINALLY saw <em>Deathly Hallows, Part 2</em>!

I definitely need to see it again. Of all the HP films, this one had the best ratio of book content to screen time; it absolutely proves that they made the right choice dividing DH into two. With only about. . . 250 pages of content to get through?. . . it gave them just the amount of time to do this last part of the story justice. Having just finished my re-read last night, I feel pretty confident saying that they made the fewest significant changes and omissions here of any of the other movies in comparison to the books.

That being said, I've always been a fan of accepting differences between the books and the movies on the understanding that storytelling on film is a much different medium that often necessitates those changes. So long as everything is still coherent for someone without extracurricular knowledge, then I'm not too bothered.

I also saw the movie in 2D. I may be in the minority, but I'm not a huge fan of this 3D revolution. Not only are the glasses annoying as hell, but I think I appreciate accomplished 2D filmmaking more simply because of what it has to do within a more limited means. But considering I DO want to see this one again, I'll probably see it in 3D the second time just for the experience. 

Okay, a few disorganized thoughts:

<lj-cut text=""Spoilerish stuff""><ul><li> It's a good thing I rewatched DH pt. 1 just a couple of weeks ago, because this started RIGHT from where that left off. There was very little doubling back. I guess I was kind of expecting a tiny bit more of that, and I'm not sure if I wished they'd put that in there or if I prefer it as it is.</li>

<li> Bellatrix-Hermione was fun. Like Felix Felicis-drugged Harry in HBP, it's fun to see the actors get to stretch the boundaries of their characters a bit and do something different.</li>

<li> McGonagall was so badass. . . and adorable. ""I've always wanted to use that spell! (Tee hee!)"" </li>

<li> I love how the friendship between Harry and Luna has evolved over the course of these movies, and you really SEE it on film in a way that is much more subtle in the books.</li>

<li> Hermione and Ron's kiss was perfect. I liked how it was a sudden, mutual moment for both of them, rather than Hermione springing it on Ron as she did in the book. And their little giggle at the end was super cute. Watching that, in my mind I was thinking, ""FINALLY! A satisfying kiss!"" No offense to Dan Rad, but Harry locking lips with anyone has been rather dull and awkward to watch.</li>

<li> There were a couple of subplots that managed to crop up that probably shouldn't have in the context of the movie: Ariana Dumbledore and Teddy Lupin. The whole ""real story of Dumbledore's past"" thing was such a minor player in the first part, serving primarily as a means of bringing us to the Elder Wand and planting seeds of doubt in Harry about the task he'd been set to do. When Hermione brings up Ariana in the Hog's Head, it seemed kind of arbitrary because there was so little back story; it felt like a throwaway comment to try and tie the painting to Aberforth. Really, I think I'd have been just as if not more happy if it had just been a portrait that didn't get any extra attention. On a similar note, Harry bringing up his son to Lupin's ""ghost"" in the Forbidden Forest comes totally out of left field in HP Movie World, because HP Movie World 1) never even told us that Lupin and Tonks were married and, 2) never told us before that point that they had a kid. If Teddy Lupin had showed up in the epilogue (from what I understand, he had been cast, but obviously cut from that final scene), then I'd get it. But without exposition on the Lupin/Tonks relationship, Harry's sorrow at about the orphaned Teddy loses its intended emotional impact. We all know I love Lupin and would never WANT to see less of him, but in this case, it was unnecessary and, for people who see this without the background of the books, even confusing.</li>

<li> I kind of wanted to see a more remorseful Dumbledore in the Kings Cross scene, but. . . again, I suppose that didn't fit with the world of the movie. So I shouldn't complain too much.</li>

<li> I LOVED that they kept Molly's ""Not my daughter, you bitch!"" line (it'd have been a crime if they hadn't, really). However, her reaction to finishing off Bellatrix was a bit too self-satisfied given her emotional motivation. I wanted to see more gravity at protecting her family so quickly after losing Fred; the smug grin on her face seems wrong given the situation.</li>

<li> I'm glad there was no grand celebration scene after Harry had finally finished off Voldemort. I was a bit worried that we'd see cheering and hugging and have swelling music and smiles all around. As it was, you got the sense that there was relief rather than happiness, and that's as it should be. For a film so teeming with massive crowd scenes and epic battles, there are some very impressively introspective moments.</li>

<li> The epilogue was not the dire Cheese Fest I was dreading. If anything, considering that they kept it in there at all, I think it was better than the book simply for the fact that it didn't try to be too cute and 90s family sitcom-esque. Dan was really the only one I completely bought as an aged version of Harry, but considering he was the only one who had to exhibit much interaction with the kids, I think that was okay.</li>

<li> Albus Severus is still a terrible name.</li></ul></lj-cut>

All that being said, I can't help but feel a bit sad that it's all over now. No more new books. No more new movies. HP is officially all in the past tense now. *sigh*

I guess we still have Pottermore to look forward to, right? And I still have rather a lot of LEGO HP on Wii to play yet. ;)

Okay, it's late and I have to sleep."

"event","Y'know what makes me sick about this whole government shutdown that's looming at midnight tonight? The fact that the politicians who are responsible for it will <em>still get paid</em> if a shutdown does occur. Military personnel who are risking their lives overseas won't get paid. Seniors won't get their social security checks. Citizens waiting for tax returns won't get their money. But the representatives and senators WILL get paid despite the fact that <em>they did not do the job that they were elected to do</em>. Can you imagine if you had a deadline at your job that you didn't meet that resulted in your patrons/customers/clients not getting the services for which they are paying you and your employer? Do you think your employer would just brush it off and say, ""Meh""?

This is what makes me so angry about politics in America right now. Politicians are elected to represent everyday citizens, but act on the job as though they are above the conventions to which everyday citizens are held. The public mud-slinging, the stubborn unwillingness to compromise, the instinct toward self-preservation rather than public service. . . Name me a job where you could consistently get away with telling off your co-workers, refusing to work as a team toward a common goal, and spending more time worrying about how to keep your job instead of actually doing it. THAT is what politics has turned in to in this country.

"event","Went to the dentist today for the first time in way too long.  That's what not having dental insurance will do to you.  You go for a year and a half--maybe more, I don't remember--without a cleaning or an exam, then you start to have sensitivity in one of your teeth that turns to pain that turns to pain in other teeth that turns to paranoia that all of your teeth are going to fall out and you're going to need dentures at age 27.  So I went in expecting the worst. . . or if not the worst, that I would at least have to have an old filling, whose home molar has been the primary source of my troubles, replaced.

Despite the out-of-pocket cost--because there gets to be a point where it doesn't matter how much it costs, you just want the peace of mind, right?--I got two x-rays done, a check-up on my self-identified trouble teeth, and a cleaning.  Lucky day, no fillings are necessary.  It's almost miraculous considering that the one I do already have, and that I was sure was going to need replacing, has been there for almost 19 years, an extra long life for a filling of any kind (""You sure got your money's worth on that one!"" the receptionist said when I explained the story).  In the end, though, it turns out that there's some enamel wearing away, thus bringing some nerves a bit closer to the surface, and there's not a whole lot I can do about that but acknowledge that I may just be one of those unfortunate people whose teeth suck like that and will have to eventually get crowns.  By then, may I be so fortunate as to have dental coverage.

Dentist gave me a little tube of Sensodyne and sent me on my merry way. . . for $116.

Until next time, sharp, nasty little gum prodder.  Who knows how far from now that'll be."

<lj-cut text=""Cut for somewhat gory details"">Ok, for reals. . .  I talked to my mom yesterday and she suggested I take a look to be sure that it's NOT a wisdom tooth, and one flashlight and magnifying mirror later, I've got a sinking feeling that I've been wrong all this time.  There's a very unpleasant looking spot back there where it looks like a tooth is trying to come in and failing miserably.  If it's infected, as it appears it very well may be, that could explain the pain and fogginess in my ear, the swelling along my jaw line, and the incurable headaches.

I've got an appointment with the dentist tomorrow morning.  Alas, there was a possibility I could go right away this morning, but the MD and I begin our intensive arts marketing training program today and until he gets there at 11 I'll be the sole representative from my company.  It probably wouldn't look good to he funders if we both were to miss the first hour.  Still sucks that I'll miss the first hour or so tomorrow, but when I've got a potentially infectious situation this close to my brain, I don't want to dilly-dally.

Still need to check on the terms of my health insurance to see if there's any way I can justify surgery to remove wisdom teeth as a medical rather than dental procedure and thus possibly get at least some financial help on this.  Otherwise, I'm without dental insurance and will therefore be dependent on my parents to help me pay for it.

Also breaking a pharmaceutical rule and taking some leftover amoxicillin from the ""lip thing"" last year in hopes that, if this is an infection, I can nip it in the bud and possibly reduce some of the pain and swelling without having to wait.</lj-cut>

The gist of the article is that people born between 1982 and 1999--""GenMe"" as the article calls us, and don't even get me started on that term!--expect more for less.  The study shows that, in contrast with Baby Boomers and GenX-ers, we value leisure time more and expect less that work be the center of our lives.  Essentially, we are looking for a stronger balance between the professional and the personal.

What gets me the most is in the interpretation:
<blockquote><em>In some respects, GenMe seems to want to have their cake and eat it too. That is they want high pay and status but aren't as interested in burning the midnight oil. ""Given that GenMe values extrinsic rewards more than Boomers did, the combination of not wanting to work hard but still wanting more money and status verifies the sense of entitlement many have identified among GenMe,"" the researchers write in an article published online this month by the Journal of Management.

The fact that GenMe individuals tend to dislike working overtime while also expecting higher status and compensation at work shows a disconnect between their expectations and reality, one that indicates a sense of overconfidence and even narcissism, said Twenge, who is also an author of ""The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement"" (Free Press, 2009) and ""Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled - and More Miserable Than Ever Before"" (Free Press, 2007).</em></blockquote>
Yeah, it's those bratty 20-somethings who collect big bonuses and slip out of the CEOs office to play a round of golf while the peons below them get laid off.

Anyway, it lit my fire and I burned away at my comment in defense of ""GenMe.""  What's wrong with not wanting to be a slave to your job?  Yes, there are bad eggs (every generation has them), but there are also a lot of us who work hard and don't think we should have to be called selfish or narcissistic for wanting time to pursue other interests.  We live in a nation that values work so much that we forget that life <em>outside</em> of work is just as important to our overall well-being.  Etc, etc, etc.

In spite of throngs of bitter comments by people complaining about us as whiney freeloaders, my response has a ""thumbs up"" ratio of 8 to 1.  Booyah.

In somewhat related news, I was officially approved as a <a href=""http://jezebel.com/people/rampantwhistler/"">commenter on Jezebel</a> today.  Now I don't just have to imagine how I would respond to things; I can actually do it."

I did a little researched online, nixed the dealership and some of the other chains (Tires Plus, Midas, the like), and decided to try out an independent shop that got good reviews on Yahoo.  Turns out that it was well worth it!  They replaced the brake pads (which had worn down to the metal, thus the nasty grinding sound I was hearing) and a burned out tail light, plus gave me an oil change all for $300.  Especially considering what I was anticipating, that's a pretty sweet deal, the oil change part in particular because that's something I knew was looming on the horizon anyway and wasn't previously factoring into the total maintenance cost.

I'll definitely go back there again and recommend it to my friends.  It's nice to find a place that tells you like it is (the mechanic actually took me back into the shop and showed me exactly what was wrong), doesn't overcharge you, treats you well, does good and speedy work, and gives you an opportunity to support local small business to boot.

Seeing as we've got our first stretch of warm, sunny weather for the year, I celebrated afterward by going to the car wash and cleaning off an entire winter's worth of salt, slush, and general muck--a shiny exterior to go with my shiny new brakes.  All in all, a happy Cruiser and a happy Cruiser owner. :)

Also had a brilliant second Irish flute lesson last night.

Basically this would have meant paying rent in two places at once, which would be almost laughable in the best of times but impossible right now when I've got to get my car fixed.  Needless to say, I was freaking out and preparing my complaints to management (""Yes, we understand that we were late in notifying you of our intention to vacate, but never was there any indication on our response from corporate that we would receive an additional month's rent as penalty. This is a very irresponsible practice."").

Thank GOODNESS it turns out that the bill was simply left for us in error and we will NOT be charged.

*collapse in a heap of exhausted elation*

Of course I still have to come up with the money to pay for the stupid car--sooner rather than later, as hurtling at 60 mph down the highway in a machine that may or may not be able to handle it for much longer, needless to say, does nothing for the already oppressive amount of stress in my life--but at least I know I should be having a deposit returned to me sometime soon (I can't remember how much I paid for that. . . $200?) and a tax return once I get around to that.  That will help at least a little bit down the road.

Sore.

Headachy.

Three-fourths dead.

But MOVED!

Well, almost entirely.  Still have a few odds 'n ends at the old place, but most everything that matters is transferred.  My amazing friends <lj user=""phantombluerose""> and <lj user=""kawaidesu""> helped all afternoon, and between the two of them, my dad, and me, we got everything over there by about 3:30 this afternoon.  I took a few more hours afterward on my own trying to put away what could be stowed in anticipation of organizing furniture tomorrow afternoon--after taking the morning off for much needed sitting around doing nothing--with the helpful input of <lj user=""catemar""> and <lj user=""flylikeapenguin"">.  What wonderful friends I have.

So far I've received universal approval on my choice of apartment.  Now that I've seen everything inside it, even in the disarray, I'm feeling very happy with its potential to be a great place to live.  The community already feels more homey than the last.  Just after we finished moving everything in, my upstairs neighbor came to the open door to introduce herself and welcome me to the building.  Guess what. . . she's a nun!  I went two years without speaking more than a minute to any of my previous neighbors, and after only one day I already have a friendly acquaintance.  She's a lovely woman and, I have to believe, will be a very quiet tenant.  I can't think of anyone I'd rather have living above me!

So, despite my physical and mental exhaustion and this headache that hasn't gone away in a good five days now, I feel like this terrible week is ending on a high note.  I'm looking forward to Monday, when I anticipate the transformation of my new home will be more or less complete."

"event","Thanks everyone for your kind comments and condolences over the past few days.  It's been a whopper of a week, and on top of the stress already underlying everything, I've been a walking train wreck.  I think I arbitrarily broke into tears at least four times yesterday.  At about 11 pm (I usually go to bed around 9) I finally felt like I could call Chris just to talk to someone.  I'm glad I did; it helped get a lot off my chest and sent me off to probably the soundest sleep I've had in a week.

There still isn't any news on my dad, which I'm hoping is a good thing.  And I did talk to my mom just a tiny bit about Flash yesterday.  Granted, my mom has an incredible ability to remain calm and rational in only the most stressful of situations--I still can't believe the even, unaffected tone with which she told me my grandpa had passed away, because I <em>know</em> that's not what she was feeling--but it helped to be reassured that there was nothing else we or anyone could have done for him and it was just his time to go.

I took that photo from my previous post, made a few prints of it, and bought some frames: one for my parents, one for my brother, and one for me.  There's a really nice photo of our old springer spaniel, Kody, sitting on the mantle at home, and I thought that there should be one up there of Flash as well.  It'll be the first photo I put up in my new apartment.

<lj-cut text=""Speaking of apartment. . ."">Finally, on to the GOOD news.  The papers are signed, the keys are in hand, and the little studio is all mine!  I moved my first load in this morning.  It was a bit of a shock again going in there and seeing just how little space I have to work with for all of my stuff, but after taking some measurements and brainstorming for awhile, I think it's going to be a cute, cozy place when all is said and done.  The renovations are <em>gorgeous</em>.  List of brand new items that, according to the manager, are the best you'll find in the entire complex:
<ul><li> Carpet.  By the look of it, better quality and better installation than the stuff in the current place, which was also new when we moved in.</li>
<li> Entry, kitchen, and bathroom flooring.  It's <em>wood</em>, kids, not vinyl.  I'm falling all over myself at my luck there.</li>
<li> Countertop, which is kind of a granite-ish red/brown that fits perfectly with the red color scheme I'm pursuing.  Already, after having only put down the red rug, it jives.</li>
<li> Kitchen appliances.  Oh my goodness, the fridge is so sparkly and beautiful!  And I don't know what it is about the range, but it's adorable.</li>
<li> Bath and tile.  Icky bathroom spots and rust and stains are always my most loathed features of apartments, so the fact that I don't have ANY of that is. . . I can't even say.  Gorgeous.</li>
<li> Kitchen/bathroom sinks and toilet.  Ditto to above.</li>
<li> Light fixtures.  I wish the ceiling fan could be in the larger room rather than the small room, but even so, it's very nice.  The lighting in the bathroom is also far superior to what I have now.</li></ul>
Other thing I'm loving: windows!  There's a giant picture window and smaller window in the main room, and a little window in both the kitchen and the bathroom.  Even though I'm facing north and won't get much for direct sunlight, it will still be a bright space that will no doubt make it feel bigger.  Of course I'll have to get some new curtain rods, since the ones I have are either too long/too short, and the existing ones are ugly and need to be removed/covered.  I'll live with that, though.

So yeah, feeling better than ever about the new place.  I'm going back after work to give all the surfaces a thorough wipe-down to get rid of the remaining construction dust, and by the end of the day will hopefully have a more-or-less completed kitchen and bathroom setup.  Tomorrow will be closets, which leaves the big furniture and boxes for Saturday, arranging for Sunday, and decorating for the day I'm taking off on Monday.  Cleaning of the old place will fall arbitrarily in there as well.  By Monday night, with any luck, I'll be ready to sleep in the new place.</lj-cut>

What a roller coaster of a week, friends.  I'm glad I have you all to keep me balanced."

He was experiencing tingling and dizziness.  It wasn't a heart attack, thank God, but they found some kind of ""electrical"" abnormality in his EKG, whatever that means.  Supposedly it's not terribly unusual for someone his age, but his body didn't react as it should to the medication he was given to bring his dangerously high blood pressure down, so they're keeping him overnight for observation and to run a few more tests.

My birthday party on Saturday was a success, which is a nice change of pace from years and years of attempted events falling spectacularly to pieces at the last minute.  I finally got to don my Gumby costume, and was pleased that my boy actually managed to put something together as well:

We also rather efficiently polished off what remained of my whiskey by watching <em>Star Trek</em> and taking a shot every time any variant of the word ""logic"" was spoken by any character.  Sadly we didn't quite have enough to do it proper justice and missed the last two in the conversation between Spock and Spock Prime.

Yesterday and on into this morning, though, I for some reason find myself feeling strangely depressed.  I should be excited that the move is only a few weeks away and that things at work should slow down a bit now that we've opened our big show. . . but instead I spent most of the day yesterday laying in bed, unmotivated by anything.  It's probably a wide combination of factors and a general feeling of being burned out, but seeing as I've been so consumed by everything for awhile now, I've barely had time to consider it all.  Maybe that's what I finally started to do yesterday--<em>think</em> about it--and that's what's going on."

I'd already missed several rehearsals due to stress and long hours and work, was facing yet another day at work with an unflappable headache, and simply wasn't feeling like I could have another thing going on in my life.  I sent the conductor an e-mail explaining my regret, and that I would look forward to joining the band again in March.

Later, sitting at home alone, I suddenly felt like I needed the diversion that playing in the band provides.  I got up, grabbed my instrument, and drove over to rehearsal, telling the conductor to disregard the e-mail.

Just now I got a response:
<blockquote><em>I'm glad I can ignore this note you sent and that you'll be able to fight through your busy schedule to make some music with all of us.  We're really glad you can be a part of our group.  Numerous flutes have mentioned how much they appreciate your mentoring in sectional work.</em></blockquote>

Doesn't help that I was sick AGAIN on Friday (low-grade fever, intense headache, sore throat, lost voice, chills. . . basically Mini Flu saved from being Big Flu by the simple fact that I've already had Big Flu this season) and had mounds to go through when I got in this morning, but every time I look up, I've got more that need attention.

The ironic thing is that a lot of the work I would ordinarily do prior to a show opening is actually being done by the theater where we're holding the performance, but because they have so many rules and procedures, I actually have MORE work to do.  How this happens, I don't know.  I suppose it has something to do with bureaucracy.  It makes me all the more pleased that I work for a small company.  Sure, the paycheck and benefits might not be as pretty, but apart from times like this, it's worth it simply for the sake of sanity.

Being sick again, I spent most of the weekend sleeping, reading (I know I'm about nine years behind on <em>Girl With A Pearl Earring</em>, but it was an enjoyable read), and watching <em>Star Trek</em>.  Yes, my friends, I am a born-again Trekkie.  I've said before that I grew up in a house where we always knew who Captain Picard was and how to do a Vulcan salute, but since this summer I've gone hard core.  I've watched all of the original series and all the movies with the original cast save V, and now I'm starting to work on TNG.  It's especially fun now that I know enough to be able to make cross-series connections; the second episode of TNG, for example, parallels a story line from one of the first TOS episodes where the crew gets an inebriation-inducing infection, causing everyone to lose inhibitions.*  Fun stuff.

Time for more work.  The tide of e-mails is starting to subside, and I don't know how she did it, but our <em>lovely</em> stage manager somehow managed to get cast and crew program bios and headshots to me BEFORE noon on the day of my deadline.  That right there is some kind of miracle.  It gives me hope.

That, along with the nice mid-week evening that I had with Chris, made the kind of icky day I was having yesterday almost all melt away.  Even my bad night of stomach cramps--worst in a long time--was made just a bit better by thinking about it. . .  Well, that and the new video of Game 163 I just got for my iPod from MLB.com's offerings of the best games of the 2009 season on iTunes.  That's right--few things lull a insomnia-stricken baseball fan with Spring Training Fever to sleep like 55,000 chanting ""MVP! MVP! MVP!""

Nonetheless, probably going to be working from home for much of the day if I can swing it.  Good news is that I do have stuff I can get done here today, so I'll take advantage of that as much as possible.

Also. . . . . . . .

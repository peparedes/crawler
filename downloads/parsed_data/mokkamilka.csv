"event","Guys,

I had a horrible day today and I fear it's going to be as horrible tomorrow and on Wednesday. When the weekend is here I'm really going to need those two days!!!
Well, the one thing that has kept me in a relatively good mood was my work on the new Rupert Everett community. I really hope fans are going to join. Today, a friend of mine joined and so we already are two members after one day!!!"

Among the movies are ""A Month In The Country"", ""The Secret Laughter Of Women"" and ""Relative Values"". I'm sure you can understand why I'm so happy!!! And I'm going to be even more happy when I get to see ""Trauma"", ""GWAPE"" and ""Fever Pitch"". I'm a real Colin Firth junkie!!!"

"event","I was wondering what Colin Firth movie is your favorite movie or what role he played is your absolute favorite???

I haven't seen a lot of Colin Firth movies, but I have to say that I was really moved by his performance in ""Another Country"" and I loved Mark Darcy in ""Bridget Jones Diary"". Haven't seen ""Pride & Prejudice"" yet, but unfortunately haven't had the time yet."

Personally, I liked it very much. And I'm pretty sure it partly has to do with the good Italian food.

"event","Yesterday, I finally got to see ""Love Actually"" and the movie was really great. Colin's storyline was by far the best. Even though I have to admit that I had to laugh about Hugh's character a few times, for instance he was dancing through his apartment (Downing Street No.10) or when and Valery are hiding and kissing and suddenly the curtain opens and reveals them kissing. Hugh can do funny faces. I have to admit that. But I LOVED Colin's character and the storyline about him and the Portuguese girl. It's really moving and very touching.
What do you think???
I'm curious???"

it's been a long time since I posted my last message. WOW!!! How time flies!!!
Just had the chance to find a website and was wondering whether you guys can help me out. I found a website and there was a photo of a Kate Firth, a voice coach on it. I know that Colin Firth's sister is called Kate and she is a voice coach. Do you think it's her. Here's the link:

The lecture in ""Data Bases"" was really interesting, hope it's going to continue. 
I also will have ""Computer Supported Cooperative Work - II"". Part one was very interesting and I hope the second part is going to be the same. Apart from that I'll take subjects in Law, Economics, Mathematics, etc. I'm not a big fan of economics though."

"event","Hi,

I've just thought about my favorite guys on T.V. and thought I could ask what your list of favorite tv guys would look like.

In Queer As Folk, my favorite guys are Peter Paige, Randy Harrison and Bobby Gant.
In Queer Eye For The Straight Guy, I have to say that Kyan Douglas, Carson Kressley and Jai Rodriguez are my favorites.
In Without A Trace, my favorite guys are Anthony LaPaglia and Enrique Murciano.
In CSI Miami, I love David Caruso.
I could go on and on, so I'm going to stop for now.
Please post your favorite guys too. I'm so curious ;)."

"event","I'm so angry at the moment. It's so ""fucking"" unbelievable what German TV can do. Well, not really German TV, but guys who are responsible that all tv channels work properly in the specific part of Germany. These guys really knew what to mess up my day. I stayed up until 2.30 am just to watch the Oscars. I was so excited and I was able to do it this year cause I don't need to work today. So I planned it all, prepared some tea, sat in front of my TV set and what happened: about 2/3 of the show was no fun to watch cause there were all kinds of disturbances in it and the last 40 minutes the screen was just blank. Why do these things have to happen??? The Academy Awards only air what, once a year. Why do they have to mess it up for the viewer."

I guess this is hell. Maybe that's it. I'm just living in hell right now. maybe i already died and this is just what i get. *sighs*"

"event","You know i woke up that morning and everything started going to chaos. then all was quiet. the bus ride to school silent, the classes in school full of questioning kids trying to figure out the truth and what was going on. everything stopped. Flags went up, everyone came together. All thinking terrorists. 

What if it wasn't terrorists? what if it was all a big lie and the government was the one that kill over 3000 people that day, not to mention the people that are still sick, and dieing from the abspestas (however you spell that). Why wont people ask questions? why are people in fear? Why isn't anyone doing anything to find answers. and why aren't we getting answers. Why is everything that relates to 9-11 deleted. Why is all the evidence vanishing about 9-11, what have they got to hide? what happened to freedom of information, and speech? the right to know? why is no one educated anymore?! 

Those two towers did not come down from the planes but there is undenyable proof that they came down because they were brought down on purpose. Controlled demolition. The pane that supposively hit the pentagon and shanksville were not planes at all. there were no signs of there being a plane. No wrekage nothing. the hole in the pentagon was to small for a plane of the magnitude. not to mention a plane would not have made it all the way through the pentagon... Ask the questions, demand the answers. do something about it."

things have changed alot.
Me and justin, still friends it's all good ish there, things still hurt though of course.
Me and joel... all i got to say is oops... lol, he's amazing.

thats my joel ^^^^^^^ met him through halo hehehehehe, he's my clan leader go figure. so of course everyone in the clan was like omg you're fucking the clan leader to stay in the clan and such things like that. 
and yeah apparently... everything that happened everyone already knows around snohomish go figure. I just hate to know what rumors are going around and what people are actually saying and what bs is being said. i know how people are. one of my old friends didn't sound to happy... *Whimpers* shit. 
but yeah my parents, are kinda more relaxed.. kinda... i know they are talking behind my back and such things. *stares at joel who's playing halo right now* 
the only time i can get online or even talk to people is when i'm with him. my parents wont let me do anything but email or apply for jobs. which well yeah. not exactly happy about it. but i have a roof over my head i guess. though they are threatening to kick me out. i kinda hate them right now. at least they are letting me out finally to get a job with out bitching constantly. 
I don't know what it is about Joel. it's like we end up argueing or whatever but then we work things out. We always talk, and work everything out, and it's cool. He tells me how much he loves me and how he hasn't felt like this before. We both have our problems to work out, and he's trying to do his best and working on his problems and helping me to get on my feet. he makes me smile. i keep questioning whether he is better than justin or not. i keep asking myself about so many things. i'm not even sure of what to do right now. Justin and i never argued really. but then we didn't grow much either. I don't think i felt anything more for him then when we first started honestly. Joel and i have had our ups and downs, but our love is growing for each other. rar. thinking to much. questioning to much. *Sighs*


and yes i do have a myspace and yes i actually check it more often now

"event","~Moonlight Shadow~
The last that ever she saw him,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.

The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.

[ Chorus ]

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.

Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.

[ Repeat Chorus ]

Far away on the other side.

Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.
The night was heavy and the air was alive,
But she couldn't find how to push through.

Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Far away on the other side.
But she couldn't find how to push through."

"event","I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty
in the moonlight
overthrew you
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne,
she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you'd let me know
What's real and going on below
But now you never show it to me do you?
Remember when I moved in you?
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah"

by Willy DeVille

Come my love, I'll tell you a tale
of a boy and girl, and their love story,
and how he loved her oh, so much,
and all the charms she did possess.

Now this did happen once upon a time
When things were not so complex,
And how he worshipped the ground she walked.
When he looked in her eyes, he became obsessed.

CHORUS:
My love is like a storybook story.
But it's as real as the feelings I feel.
My love is like a storybook story.
But it's as real as the feelings I feel;
it's as real as the feelings I feel.

This love was stronger than the powers so dark,
A prince could have within his keeping;
His spells to weave and steal a heart
Within her breast, but only sleeping.

(To CHORUS :)

He said, ""Don't you know I love you oh, so much,
And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?""
She said, ""Don't you know that storybook loves
Always have a happy ending?""

(Don't go to the CHORUS!) (ha-ha) :)

Then he swooped her up, just like in the books,
And on his stallion they rode away.
(NOW you can go to the CHORUS!)

Buttercup:
""Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that, not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it, not with a thousand swords."""

i hate being alone in a room, cause then i think... to much. about the past about him, whether he's changed or not, whether the past is still looming.. fuck the past. we'll see what happens... 

still need to talk to him.... everytime i'm here something else comes up... damnit."

"event","i have to talk to him and work things out...

tell him what i really think

tell him what i truly feel

and how i know i shouldn't have allowed what i had, and.... ugh.. so fast, so short time, so many times....

*takes deep breath* i love him. 

i just hope he actually does love me back. (i know deep down he does, but sometimes...)

he's brilliant, mature, gentle, funny....
yet something there underneath that bothers me that makes me long to know him more, and figure him out.. what is there and why

for so long i got used to things changeing so much that i began to relize that you can't really trust anything anyone.. not fully. i want to trust him. but how? 
one week i'd be good friends with someone then the next everything falling apart. so many groups fell apart, so many friends that like each other hate each other now. 

i just pray things are different now. 

I watch him work, and fiddle with technology, and i admire his beauty, his gentle face and touch, careful delibrate movements, his eyes so deep, he's just so different. so ... i dont' know how to explain it. 

maybe i just don't know what to do or say.

yet at times i wonder, i wonder if it's real, i wonder if things have indeed changed. 
I know he'll disappear one day for a long time, and all i can do is wait. but can i? should i? 
will he want me still?
I fear i wont recognize him when he comes back, i fear that he will change and be someone completely different. 

maybe this makes no sense to anyone else, maybe it's just me. so many times i've been told i'll just get hurt again. will i?

if only i knew half of his thoughts about me... what he really thinks... 

or should i know?


wtf is wrong with me? meh long post... thinking to much again. i guess things will all work themselves out in time. and talk to him in a few days. 
i see him to much... way to much, yet it's kinda a get away, a place i can relax... meh... i should just probably not go over there during the week... i dont know... *sighs* i wish i knew what he truly wants. 




*Shrugs* life goes on day by day. at least work has been good. cept i get four days off... randomly and not the day i asked for off... rar.

woot more money to be spent for college. what fun. 
i miss you all. *hugs to everyone*"

"event","did you really love me?
did you really care?
Or was it just for yourself.
Was it just that you wanted to be better,
To prove that you are smarter.
did you really want me back?
Or do i really matter?
I said one thing, 
you told me wrong,
I said the other,
I still was wrong.
Was there really anything that you thought right?
Is there anything that i do/say that is right to you?
Or are you not capable of this love you speak?
Or are you not capable of just being friends?
Of just being there, 
Just listening.
Not interupting,
Not yelling,
Not interupting.

Your voice was so soft in my ear,
I longed to hear it more.
Yet the anger i feared,
The fear of being wrong,
Of being yelled at for being wrong,
Of saying something wrong..
Like so many times before.
What am i supposed to do?
what more can i do?"

They wanted me gone,
They said that i don't matter,
That there was no help for me.
None of my work is really worth it,
Nothing i have is good enough.
But my hands, and heart draw them close.
Prevents the pain
Prevents the sorrow
from going to far.
My careing love for others
Stops myself from making the jump.
I wish not to harm,
I wish to heal.
Yet i fear i've cause the things around me
the fears, the sorrows.
The breaks, the bends 
I love you."

another fight.. 
another loss... 
if only i could do something about it. 
but i suppose it's to late now. 
another tells me he'll kill himself 
and i find it my fault. 
another pain. 
another sorrow.
what's to come of this?
in love, yet pained
free, but chained.
I lift it all up to a higher source.
And then it dissapears.
but it comes back, 
time and time again.
Free me oh lord, 
lead me to the stillness, 
guide my future, 
forgive my past.
I understand it now.
I know why this has all happened..
again to late.
far to late.
the flames grow higher.
the time flys by.
they're gone.
for good?
forever?
I will not know.
I know how, 
But I don't know why.
Over and over it happens.
Does nothing ever change?
I know they care,
I know i'm loved.
I know i'll be sorely missed.
But can i take this so much longer?
Give me time,
give me space.
What's left of me is love alone,
Caring for another.
I don't really care what happens to me,
Just pray that everyone else is happy.
Not a selfish bone in my body,
Just the longing to help others.
Don't ask to understand,
Not even i do.
It's who i am, 
It's what i do."

i so badly wish i could move out.. but i really don't see me ever really getting a chance till after college. and with me... who knows how long that is.

graduation next month.... fucking fs...stupid grades. i don't know why i let myself slide. i can't believe i did. getting back up never happened either. i kept saying ""oh this year...""... nothing ever happened. i kinda feel sorry for my parents. they can't say ""oh i have a honor student going to the banquet"". all they say is ""are you going to graduate this year?"". *Shakes head*. yeah i'm in one of those not caring pissed off want to kill someone yet still oddly happy states. i guess it's chris that's improved things for me. he's different. don't ask me how or why if i knew i'd say. we'll see what happens this summer. it'll be six months this month. he loves me so much... and i him... but with all the chaos in my life? i'm scared i'll hurt him. sometimes i do wish i could just dissapear for awhile till things mull over. *ShrugS* oh well.

graduation poem:


alas,
the time has come to pass,
dreams of past and future.
here it is, the very last year,
the last few days, the last few hours.
you all have taught me many things.
the ways of life, 
and the ways to live.
i look over the land,
of what's to come
and what's come to pass.
loving kindness and tender care,
patient trust, and gentle hands.
here i stand on my own,
wings ful grown,
ready to fly"

"event","Everybody's got something they have to leave behind
One regret from yesterday that just seems to grow with time
There's no use looking back or wondering
How it could be now or might've been
All this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true 'til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you

Somewhere in my memory I've lost all sense of time
And tomorrow can never be cause yesterday is all that fills my mind
There's no use looking back or wondering
How it should be now or might've been
All this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true
Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will, say you will, you know you will, oh baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget
There's no use looking back or wondering
Because love is a strange and funny thing
No matter how I try and try
I just can't say goodbye
No, no, no, no

I never had a dream come true
Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be
A part of me will always be with you"

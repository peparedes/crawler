even if you took ap history with muller and though it was a joke,
 you WILL get a 3 on the test and you will NOT get credit

and even if you like english a lot and think you handled sweeney well junior year, you WILL get your ass kicked personally by sister loretta herself.

mmm just finished writing a LOVELY midterm of 3 essays.
right after a theology midterm with 2 essays.
fucking THEOLOGY...the class where all you have to say is ""dont have sex until you're married"" and you get an automatic 100. i sweated it.
but, i enjoyed a snack. THANK YOU LORETTA.


p.s. I LOVE ALEXA DELAVALE AND PINECONES AND IF YOU MESS WITH HER I WILL MESS UP YOUR FACE CAUSE IM BIG AND TALL AND SCARY. word."

damn these feelings

I have nothing to say
everything
just fades away
there was nothing

your mind was made
the thoughts they stay
the choice was yours
and you went that way
and chose the other
and now, never
will we find each other
I will just find another
and hopefully
we'll love each other
the love
we couldn't have
which I think
is just to bad
losing all
we might of had
it tears me up
and spits me out
it will be hard

you beside me
and in my heart
but I feel
it's time we part

you
how do you
do what you do
you are my drug
you're my nicotine

what I feel is a bit obscene

I am put through so much pain
and through it all no personal gain
but just one wish
I want you to be my queen
yes it is obscene
far from the truth
not a reality
but yet I still hope
for this dream
choices being made
that are my heaven or hell
I wish you well
I really do
all I want
is tobe with you
with you here
I wont fear
that lonely darkness
that creeps near
I love you so
but sometimes I just don't know
if it is the way to go
all the things you do
make me fall in love with you
oh how I want to be with you
make you feel so good
if I could
you know I would
you might not know what you had
until what you had is gone
and I hope it doesn't end this way
but sometimes it's just the price to pay
for the choices that we make
you just might be making a mistake
knowing what you have is fake
these stupid risks you sometimes take
and when it's all said and done
I might not still love you hun

""...Little Suzy
She was only twelve
She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and
Hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud
But no respect for herself

She finds love in
All the wrong places
The same situations
Just different faces

Changed up her pace
Since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

Johnny boy
Always played the fool
He broke all the rules
So you would
Think he was cool

He was never
Really one of the guys
No matter
How hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

It's kind of hard when
You ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end
They might remember him then...."" - P.O.D. - Youth of the Nation"

Times of Change
thinking your so special
just ripping me apart
going about your day
my heart slowly fades away
living life so blind
not knowing which way to take
always making a mistake
its unvailing so damn fast
reminding of my past
I grow so callous
no longer I can feel
that I've felt before
I'm just a stupid whore
pounding at your front door
but expecting not a glance
this is your only chance
before I walk away
and here alone
you will stay
tired of all the shit
I take another hit
and then fall to the ground
I will be your whore no more
now I am feeling so damn free
now I'm living life
the way it's meant to be
no longer am I confused
no longer I feel used
I am free of my cage
these are times of change

Regrets
thinking
thinking you relate
you only bring me hate
tell me in my ear
all the things that you fear
shaping you to my mold
letting you unfold
but still keeping you controled
you think your doing fine
but I'm still eating at your mind
with your fears I still control you
I loved you so much
but still you pushed me aside
not knowing what you had
until it was gone
I am just done
with all of this shit
I crawl out of this pit
of my depression
this is a confession
meant just for you
I am tired of all the things I do
everything was just for you
and none of it matters
you don't even care
not willing to share
the feelings I had for you
all the things you do
is why I fell for you
but this fall
ended up breaking
so much more than just my heart
my whole world just fell apart
and now
not knowing where to start
I feel so damn stranded
and branded
on my head
the regrets of what I said
what I felt
what I should of done instead...."

"event","So yesterday we left for a 6 day vacation up to the Houghton Lake area to spend at a little resort that Stephanie used to visit as a kid.&nbsp; It is one of those little places, nothing too special, but it is quiet, very quiet.&nbsp; (note quiet = good for me.)

We took off ourselves and left Ethan with my parents and my parents are joining us tonight.

Today is also the 9th anniversary of our wedding.&nbsp; Yup 9 year ago today I married Stephanie.&nbsp; Still mostly fond of the decision.

This area is quiet nice and simple.&nbsp; There is enough to be able to survive like home up here but all the rat race is miles away.&nbsp; And dear lord though, why are there so many Saloons up here.&nbsp; I swear 50% of the bars up here refer to themselves as saloons.&nbsp; Is the northern part of lower michigan part of the old west?&nbsp; But we did luck out last night, we found the one bar that seemed to pull in the younger crowd, not too young as I think I have seen about 20 people so far at are between the ages of 12 and 32.&nbsp; Most people in these parts are like 40 and older.

So it has been nice and all, but......

Today I call my mom to ask her to bring dish washing gear, some plastic zip top bags and hot dogs if she had them.&nbsp; I could have actually bought them up here, and now looking back on it.&nbsp; I should have.&nbsp; Because now, there is a marr on day of my wedding.&nbsp; One that is going to last for years to come, maybe even certain lifetimes.

When I asked for those items, I unwitting placed the domino that lead to death of an innocent......literally.

My mom's new little dog, Pixie, was killed today.

My mother is currently running in a manic phase of her bipolar issues.&nbsp; The woman needs meds, but she is one of those stops taking meds when she feels go.&nbsp; When my mom is manic, her attention span drops.&nbsp; She doesn't focus well.&nbsp; She was trying to prep herself to get these bags I asked for since she didn't have them and wasn't watching as the puppy hopped out of the car.&nbsp; She closed the door on the puppy.&nbsp; Seems it was a breaking of a spine.

Pixie is dead.&nbsp; 

I feel bad for my mom as she is thinking this is all her fault.&nbsp; But my biggest concern is that Ethan was witness to this it seems.&nbsp; And well, I don't completely trust my mom when she is in these states to not to freak out and causing Ethan to freak even more.

And I sit here, mind is racing of the next few days.&nbsp; How I am going to deal with my crashing mother?

My mother needs an intervention for her bipolar issues.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to do that friends?"

I will not allow it to be far from me, but I do not want to lose it as I nearly lost it once this winter with cold wet hands.<br /><br />So many people have asked me if I am doing this because I am standing up at a friend's wedding.&nbsp; The answer was no I am doing this to be able to see my son graduate high school and then college.&nbsp; And I would like to stave off diabetes for as long as I possibly can.&nbsp; But I have to sit here now and think about that wedding day, I could be thin and sexy *Laughs*&nbsp; Now there is a concept that is really foreign to me.&nbsp; If nothing else, the best man and matron of honor will not look like the number 10 next to one another.</font></font>"

"event","preface....I am drunk, very drunk.

Tonight I am sitting in one of my favorite bars, the Korner Pub in Owosso.&nbsp; This bar has became one of my favorites due to my wife.&nbsp; A point for people to understand, Owosso is white bred through and throught.&nbsp; Owosso has about 5% people that aren't white.&nbsp; We are sitting in a busy Korner tonight and a black guy walks into the bar in a superman shirt.&nbsp; Superman is just standing at the bar chatting with people.&nbsp; The table behind us was a large white guy, a small white guy and a medium white girl.&nbsp; They were drunk and being asses before superman showed up.&nbsp; The bartender was cutting them off an hour before since she knew shit was coming.

Until tonight I had little clue the shit being a black man entailed.&nbsp; Superman was just chatting at the bar when the asses at table behind decided that Owosso wasn't large enough for Superman.&nbsp; Before most of us knew it, Table Asses started in on Superman.&nbsp; Superman handled it all pretty damn well only fought when he had too.&nbsp;&nbsp; I give him a ton for handling the Table Asses.&nbsp; Another gentleman stepped in between the sets and kept things long enough for the cops to show up to pull the groups outside.&nbsp; The Table Asses were pulled outside and the main one was taken to jail in the end.&nbsp; Superman stayed inside as long as he could, but in the end he had to step outside to bitch out the jackasses.&nbsp; And in the end, I&nbsp; can't blame Superman for feeling this way.&nbsp; Jesus christ, he just wanted beer like the rest of us and in the end Jackasses needed to cause issue that limited Superman to his beer.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is just bullshit.

Until tonight, I just always thought of white and black equal, but really, we aren't equal.&nbsp; Whites have it easier in many places.&nbsp; This is what I will believe until I step into a place where I am treated like Superman by a group of blacks.

I have to say one thing......the cops in Owosso, good people in the end.....the white Asshole is in jail, Superman even though he was pissed, walked away without issue.

Tonight I learned about myself.....I am not a racist, I am a culturist.&nbsp; Skin color means nothing to me.&nbsp; Attitudes is all that matters in the end."

"event","I am looking for an updated naming scheme for my home network.&nbsp; Since the days of The House, I have been using South Park characters, lately I have been restricting myself to the kids only.

Like my main machine is Cartman as for the longest time it was the biggest fattest machine in the group.&nbsp; My file server is Stan.&nbsp; My laptop is Kyle with the virtual machines on it named Ike.&nbsp; My testing machine is always Kenny.....

But now, I am in the middle of a project that I am out to reduce the fleet of machine by about half.&nbsp; I am moving a mass amount of hardware into a box that will be housing 2 motherboards taking over file serving duties and I will be putting a series of virtual machines into it to be my inhouse web server and a whole slue of other services I like to use randomly but require certain OSs but really don't require decicated hardware.&nbsp; I am mainly doing this as it should allow a reduction of power use by about 35% in my basement.

So I am looking for a new naming scheme.&nbsp; Something that can easily branch out so you can logically understand where a virtual server is running, conveys size of the physical machines, and if it can be branched enough to cover samba shares would be wonderful.&nbsp; And to top it off, I would love to use something that is geeky in the end, but not dorky like I would love to steer away from Star Trek or Star Wars only schemes.

I know, it can't be done.

I have been thinking about starships but from different shows.&nbsp; Something like this

Machine Name --&nbsp; Virtual Machine Name -- Shares
Federation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enterprise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  --&nbsp;&nbsp; Riker

I haven't been the best about tracking what I have taken in since Friday, but I haven't gone nuts either, except for Saturday.

Friday was such a fun day....stopped in at a job site to finish up some work and we lost power to the place for about an hour.&nbsp; Long enough that we had to power down the servers and then that took about 30 mins to have them all back up. so my plans were shot for the day.&nbsp; Got home a little early, thank god though, I found my basement in about an inch of water.&nbsp; So most of Friday was spent cleaning up and drying out.

Saturday was fun in the regards that my house's power was going in and out from about 2 to 5:30.&nbsp; I would say it happened 60 times in that time frame.&nbsp; Also on Saturday, I figured out what caused the water in the basement.&nbsp; I have a crack in our water software, type of damage that is going to require replacement of the unit unless if I can figure out how to repair fiberglass.

Sunday, I spent most of the day grocery shopping and other running for the house.&nbsp; And dammit, I love how much it costs to buy real decent food.

Monday was normal really, but yesterday was fun in that I got to stay home all day due to that my wife took my car keys with her to work.

So time for the break down:
Weigh in on Wednesday 364 lbs (-14 lbs)

Friday
Tuna Sandwich
Apples
Chicken and potato dinner

Saturday
Half a pizza
3 breadsticks
SoCo and Lime drinks
Yes this was a bad day, but it tasted so good

Sunday
Tuna Sandwich
Apples
Lean Cuisine

Monday Approx 1600
3 Chicken Tacos
2 Bologna Sandwiches
Apple

Tuesday 
1 Pulled pork Sandwich
Cottage Cheese
Pineapple
2 Apples

Sadly it took 3 days to wear off Saturdays little eat fest.&nbsp; I will need to learn to curb those days a bit more."

I am in the process of trying to lose weight, a lot of weight.  155 pounds to be exact.  I am going to start to place updates on my progress here.  I may work it where I put my whole food intake and everything on here.

If you need to remove me from your friends because you don't want to see these daily updates, I completely understand.  But I ask for those who stay around to help me.  If you don't see me posting enough info, bitch at me please.  This is truly going to be a one day at a time thing.  I have been watching everything for the last 5 days now and that is how my mental activities are already gearing too.

Well to start off,  I started at 378 lbs.  I hadn't weighed myself in probably 10 years now.  I had myself weighed at Doc's offices from time to time, but I never really paid much attention.  I always had a rough guess.  Really, 378 was far off from what I thought.  I want to be 220 at the end of this first major phase.  I have given myself until 12-31-2008 for this 220 lbs.  15 months, yes a lofty goal really it is.  10 pounds a month.
I am shooting for 1500 to 2000 calories intake a day with 30g of fat or less.  Now some will say that this is not enough of a drop to make my goal in the timeframe.  I understand this.  I have started to increase my exercise, but at the weight I am at it is not easy for me to do the things I like to do for working out, mainly biking.  I loved that so as a kid and teenager.  Until I have some of this weight off I am going to have to deal with just walking and Wii time, thinking about getting a DDR pad.  Yeah, my sis had one around here when she lived here.  It was quite fun and really mindless working out.  It kept my mind off of things with the task at hand with the music.

Any suggestions people have would be grand.&nbsp; Anything that I can do to workout to say and be able to have it be mindless or easy to continues would be wonderful.&nbsp; I just have the problem that get bored with working out and wish I could be doing something else.&nbsp; It is not so much a physical stress issue for&nbsp; as it is a mental boredom.

So the boring part:&nbsp; 374 lbs (-4 lbs)
Saturday Count:&nbsp; approx 1700 calories 33g
2 Apples 260
1 Bologna Sandwich&nbsp; 320&nbsp; 4g
Coffee Drinks&nbsp; 150&nbsp; 
2 BLT Sandwiches&nbsp; 650 25g
Coleslaw 100
Veggies&nbsp; 100
Popcorn 100 4 g

Such is my life now.&nbsp; Happy Days"

"event","So I am going to steal this from <lj user=""terkey"">

1. Post a list of 20 fandoms.
2. Have your friends list guess your fave character from each fandom
3. When guessed, bold the fandom, put in brackets who got it and sentence why you like the character/person.

1. Star Trek = Mr Scott (<lj user=""socratesthecat"">) My favorite for how he was the one to keep everything running and well I completely agree with his idea of over estimate your needed times to look like a miracle worker.
2. Star Wars
3. Most recent Dr Who/Torchwood universe = Capt Jack (<lj user=""socratesthecat"">) He is just great, funny, take no shit additude...and shags anything that is beautiful.
4. Stargate
5. Scrubs = Dr Cox (<lj user=""socratesthecat"">)  I love Dr Cox for him just ripping on anyone and everyone.
6. Buffyverse = Willow (giving it to <lj user=""terkey""> ):  She was the ultimate greek tragedy in modern form.  She starts like most, finds great power, falls to it and returns to help in the end.  And well she was hot too.
7. MST3K
8. Hercules/Xena = Autolycus (<lj user=""terkey"">):  Yup, one of the funniest and damn it who doesn't love Bruce.
9. Final Fantasy
10. LOTR = Gandalf (<lj user=""socratesthecat"">):  Sometime you just have to like the old wise magic user.
11. Looney Tunes = Wile E. Coyote (<lj user=""waldo_"">):  He has the greatest toys, now if he just could miss that rock.
12. CSI = Lady Heather (<lj user=""ouijarose"">):  Just Drool.
13. Kids in the Halls
14. Monty Python = John Cleese (<lj user=""socratesthecat"">): He was just the best at physical comedy in that group.
15. Austin Powers = Scott Evil (<lj user=""socratesthecat"">):  I love the scathing additude and how he breaks down in the end.
16. The Muppets = Statler and Waldorf (<lj user=""waldo_"">:  They always get the last laugh.
17. A Bug's Life = Heimlich (<lj user=""terkey"">):  Come who doesn't love a beautiful butterfly.
18. Transformers = Optimus Prime (<lj user=""socratesthecat"">):  It was the great toy and the greatest leader.
19. Invader Zim
20. X-files = (<lj user=""ouijarose"">):  The lone gunmen were my favorite group of characters in pop scifi.  Langley was my fave simply due to his computer skills."

"event","So this morning I find myself up at 8 and on a mission, like many others I was out to find a Wii.&nbsp; Since about christmas when Stephanie found out that there is a fishing game for it, she has wanted one.&nbsp; What am I to complain, it is fun new technology.&nbsp; So having stashed away most of my christmas for this purpose, we took off this morning.&nbsp; I headed to the west side of lansing and stephanie to okemos.&nbsp; I hit up Circuit first and failed, so I stepped over to the Worst Purchase place and hopped into the line there, as Stephanie was in the line at the other Worst Purchase across town.&nbsp; I missed being an Ebay millionare by one, but Stephanie did land a voucher #33 of 37.&nbsp; 

So it was interesting to see how the two Worst Purchase places treated people.&nbsp; The one I went to just handed out the vouchers and talked about the Toy Replacement Treament and let people on the way.&nbsp; Stephanie's told the people that they should continue to stand in line for another hour until opening.&nbsp; Hmmmm odd.

So I drove across town and stephanie stepped out of line cause she had our two year old with her in the 22 degree weather, (only 20 mins out and he was bundled well) but it was time for him to warm up.&nbsp; So I hopped into line with the voucher and waited the now 40 mins.

Why was she to wait in line more?&nbsp; It was so they could sell you more.&nbsp; I was now at the end of line....no huge deal to me really.&nbsp; So they went down the line and started to ask what people were going to buy.&nbsp; Now this was mildly helpful as they kept track of the wiimote and other accessories inventory to keep a stampeed from happening.&nbsp; But it also was a lesson in FUD when it came to the Toy Replacement Treament Plan.&nbsp; I heard how the sensor bar doesn't have a replacement and how it could fail easily, how common it is for people to throw the wiimotes into walls, and other optical disc drive failures.&nbsp; And then came the gold plated component cables for the low low price of $60 bucks.&nbsp; Now I understand upselling, but so many lies and I love how they sent out a young woman to do this upselling to the large group of guys and clueless mothers.

Then they come to me and I tell them no on everything they try to upsell and I start to get the wonderful looks and attitude from them like I was missing out on a lot and got that secret feeling that they didn't want to sell to me without all the extra crap (the wife was running around to other stores for the other parts as WP was out of the extra wiimotes now.)&nbsp; So I stepped into the store at 11 and collected my space in the check out line and purchased the system after going through the spiels once again on the TRT plans.&nbsp; And then how if I wanted a 2 months of a fucking MAGAZINE that has nothing to do with technology.&nbsp; Ok I can handle if it was Wired or a ZD or Nintendo magazine, but these are like redbook quality. WTF

But I am now home with the wonderful Wii, an extra wiimote, numchuck, and Wario Ware and you know what, it is great silly fun, just like a video game really should be."

"event","Well, welcome to my favorite day of the year.  It is my fave for so many reasons and candy is just the first.

Today is a day that has so many meaning really.  For some it is just a day of candy and for others, it is the end of one worldly cycle and the starting of the next, a form of new years.  Still others, it is the night where you remember loved ones.  And because of a few of those possiblities, I am taking the time to make notes of peoples and times that mean so much to me.

First and foremost, today is the 7th aniversary of Stephanie and mine's handfasting.  We took the time on Samhain to start our lives as a married couple.  Yes we had a formal wedding a few months earlier but both of us took the time to acknowledge our union within our our beliefs.  It was a wonderful night, our close friends on a beach on Lake Michigan.  It was so windy but it was hardy cold at all.   Dave was so kind to guide over the night for us.  I love you, Stephanie and I still thankful that we choose to spend our lives together.

Speaking of Dave, I remember the first few times that I celebrated Samhain.  I was part of a group of very interesting people.  All were intelligent and insightful in their own ways.  When I think of Dave, Kristin, Nicole and Scott, I invision 5 comets streaking through space with paths that cross.  Each of us found another and started a dance, more gathered, the dance continued, each flying around one another, but in the end the gravity just wasn't enough and our path continue out.  But those times taught me so much, it opened my eyes to new ideas.  So tonight, I will think of you four.  Blessed Be to you.

With other loved ones, I can't help but think of the uncle I lost this year.  No I wasn't the closest with him, but the ripples from his passing was great, especially for my father.  He was the first of my father's sibligs to pass and I can still see the effects now.  But I look at it this way, my uncle gave much of his life for his wife.  Sadly she was ill in her own right and she left this world a few years ago now.  I hope beyond hopes that he with his release from this world too that he has found her once again and they are having the joy they so deserved.

Also to my father, I have nothing to say but thank you.  You helped me become the person I am today.  You stepped up nearly 30 years ago now and took the duties of another and excelled at them.  We do not see eye to eye always but I think that is just how it is with Father and Son.  I wish I knew how to say everything that needs to be said to show my gratitude, but sadly I do not really.  So again, Thank you.

To my mother, you gave me so much of what I am.  Many of my traits have came from you, but thank you still.  But what I am truly thankful for now, is how you have taught me once again in how to be a parent.  Dad taught me how to be a man, you taught me how to love and care for my son.

To Mr. E (here there are going to be some that I don't name names but they mean just as much in the end), you were the second most important man to me.  You fill in areas where my father didn't understand.  Because I had different DNA, I have more of an anger streak than my father and this left me confused at times.  What you truly taught me Mr. E wasn't used right away, but as I grew and the anger of a teenager came about and other things actions that just weren't needed, I looked back on how you acted and how you lived.  I used this as a framework and now I am fully able to have a normal life, marriage and children.  If I didn't have you guidance, I know I wouldn't have the things I do today.  So Thank you, my wife thanks you, my son thanks you.

To Mr. M, again another man in my life that I own much too.  But what he gave me what a gift that was the foundation to my love of music.  I once was in the band at school and in the choir at school, and I loved them both dearly.  But as I grew, my abilities with the instrument didn't.  I just could make my hand move fast enough to be a good player.  So I had to stop, and I know that didn't make you the happiest.  But you taught me one thing that helped so greatly, my beginings to music theory.  I grew and my voice grew and that was my instrument.  You taught me how to read music, understand music.  So I thank you.

To Mrs. J, one of the first women besides my mom to really form me.  She was my kindergarten teacher, she was my choir director and she was my science teacher in 8th grade.  But the main thing I thank you for is my music, you were the Yang to Mr. M Yin.  You started me with my voice and helped me to tuned and use it.  You gave me my love for music and music is such an enriching point of the world really.  But I have to also thank you for more, you were there in my life and you talked to me in the late days of grade school as a near adult.  And you helped me find a better place in the world, then just being a complete little shy nerd.  Thank you.

And to finish for now, I want to thank my son for coming into this world.  You are nothing but the joy of life and the purpose of life too."

"event","We are having the annual Halloween Party agian this year, back at our house again.  After much talking with friends and whatnot, it was decided to have it at our house again to minimize driving for most.

When:  October 28
Time: 6:00 pm

We are asking people this year to bring a passing dish of snacky foods to help reign in the costs that this always forms.  Costumes are as always HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  We will point and laugh if you don't wear one.  If you are in need of a costume idea, I suggest Super heros or villians.

We would also like to ask people to RSVP so we can plan on other needs.  As always there will be some open room for people to crash and sleep in the house, first requested, first served.  Bring Friends and others.

Contact me here, on the phone or at captangrypants_(at)_gmail_com.

If you are seeing this is probably means you are quite invited."

"event","*Warning* This post may have some bitching and whining included.  Contents maybe hot.  Use at own risk.

So it has been a while since I have posted and be to honest I haven't been in the most outward friendly mood lately.  I think it has to do with the whole thing of my birthday is just right around the corner.  Now some may think that 29 isn't that bad of an age at least it isn't 30 right?  I really think it is worse than 30.  This year my life has changed so much.  This year is when I really felt like a father, had to buy the minivan, money has been tight, feel like I am just spinning my wheels in the muck of life, and in the last few months I have really felt like I am just a fat man.  I no longer feel like a young person but I don't feel like an adult but I feel like everyone else looks to me as an adult.

Now I am at a point in my moodiness that is quite tense and I feel like I could snap in some werid way.  The seasonal affected disorder has hit in a bit early and I hate not having enough daylight to stay happy.  I am already Bah Humbuging the holidays.  I am feeling empty and vaccant in the religious part of my life.  I haven't been able to practice in years really except being solitary.  And truthfully I am not a solitary type.  Scary thought I know.  Now I have very odd outlooks on life and religion and I won't go into them all here, but if you like just ask me one day and try not to look surprised.

I am a little ticked with my decisions that have lead me back into Owosso so much.  I like the town since it is such a sleepy little place but it is a sleepy little place sometimes with too many little minds. I wish I had more reason to be in larger towns.

*Warning* continuing could be painful.
My sex drive has been almost gone.  I don't know why really anymore.  I don't have sex often really, as Stephanie really doesn't desire it often.  But lately, my drive is just has been lost and it has been adding to that emptiness.  I don't even ask for it anymore.  It may be just that I have such odd ideas and desires for sex that I know will not be fufilled, that I have just shut down over it all.

I don't know about it anymore really.    I am happy for the most part but I am just confused.  But thus is life for me anymore."

Jamie and Dodge were first.  Now this was only a bit surprising as they have been living together awhile.  But Jamie was always the type that fought the idea of marriage.

Now I just received a call from my long time friend, Jason with him asking me to stand for him in the wedding.  Oh cripes, now he is a guy that I thought would be the longest bachelor of my friends.  But nope, he is taking the plunge too.

So if you other couple out there decide to annouce engagements, please wait until next week as my brain can't handle it.  I am looking at you, Paul and Trisha, Dan and Kendra, or Aaron and Melissa.

Thank you, that is all.  I need to fight off Wilfred Brimley from my pantry now."

Megas are made half up of Brown, Blue-gray and BEIGE.   FUCKING BEIGE.  Oh I can see the commercials now, enter the new computer generated M&M, ""I am so boring, I can't even bring a bit of joy to your sad life, whoa is me""

"event","I saw something today that I don't think I ever want to see again.  Last night, just outside of my home town of Owosso there was a house that exploded.  Here is the best news post I can find for the moment.

http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=local&id=3412114

It has a video of the newscast but sadly it has no footage of the site.  Well, I had to drive to Owosso this morning and replace the brake pads on my van with my father-in-law and found out about this.  So this afternoon, we just had to drive pass.  I have seen thing blown up before but never to this extent.  The really sad thing is that 6 children lost their lives in this blast and 3 more are in the hospital.  In the newscast they say the house was like 95% gone, I don't agree.  The foundation was remaining, but the rest was bits and pieces about the lawn like wood, siding, clothing, bits of furniture.  The cars were still there, beatened and battered.  I wish I had my camera with me.  I may try to get out there tomorrow with a camera but the last I heard, the police had the road blocked.

Granted this is no where close to Katrina destructive force, but it is amazing how strong natural forces can be."

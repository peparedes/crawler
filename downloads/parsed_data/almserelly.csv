"event","so ive got about 2 and a half months left in the bay. HOW WEiRD is it gonna be not living here anymore! ... and seeing stevo everyday damn, thats gonna be a trip.  but i owe it to myself to really get out there and see what i can do with myself.  school is going good and even statistics is doin' me right. shit, i thought i would never say i passed a math class by myself.

i guess your focus and your perception of what is important really changes when you want something so bad.  when you know you're so close to your goal you'd be a fool to mess up now.  math isn't so hard when you understand and have grasped the fact that credit in that class is the only factor holding you back in taking you where you wanna go in your life. or atleast the first step in where you wanna go in life.

i'm so excited, i'm really beginning to feel it. ive never been that far away from home, or if i have, the comfort of me knowing i was returning at the end of a certain period of time always struck me.  but now i'm gonna be calling another place home!! so weird.. to everyone else whom i know has moved is probably like-- damn girl, calm down. but i'm really attached to my family and i'm just a big  walking question mark as to how i might function without them.  i know i'll be fine tho, i'm not gonna screw up and throw it all away just cuz it's all new to me. 

on the other hand i dont know if i wanna walk the chabot stage.. or fuck, if there even is a stage.. what is it? like a cement platform? beats the shit outta me.. but i'm kind of on the fence as far whether i should participate in the ceremony or not. i mean dang it is an accomplishment. i'm getting my AA in Liberal Studies so that's gotta account for something.  i know my girls will be there and my mom and brothers.. my dad will be in the philippines for another reason and i don't blame him for going. i wish he was there tho of course-- but what's out there is more important, its family business.  i think i just might walk the stage cuz i know i'd kick my ass if i didnt and looked back like 'damn.. i shouldve just did that shit.'  i mean i may look like a square but i'm proud of what ive done and really tho people blow it up like people really don't make it out of chabot and if they do.. they just transfer without a degree under their belt.

anyway, i think ive decided i'm gonna do it and stop being hella anti-social and scared of looking retarded. lately ive been chillen a lot with my girls and shit has been great. i swear they hella make me laugh and its always a blast, we aint never bored when we're around each other.. we always have fun one way or another. i'm really gonna miss them! they better not forget about me when i leave which i know they wont. of course, the inevitable is gonna happen and we'll lose touch a little but nonetheless i think it'll still be the same. they love me too much to just up and leave me like that. =) they better come visit tho or imma be pissed off.

so just wanted to update and say that life is good. life really is great especially when you know that every day of your existence was spent making yourself or someone else a little better or a little more happy.. thats why i don't understand why people be HATiN on other people.. shit, we're all here for a common goal so why push each other down when the other is startin' to get where they wanna be.. shouldn't that just make you want to work harder for yourself to be on that level?  greedy ass people need to learn how to share the spotlight. have a good night yall."

"event","i guess there are no words to fully explain why God chooses to take people away.
nobody understands HOW he chooses to take away the people he does,
but i do believe it's for his own specific reasons that we here, don't know.
sometimes i feel like the world around me is dying.
not so much just literally, but peoples spirits just give up some times.
i think sometimes when people feel like God has closed a door on them,
they just give up instead of trying to climb thru the open window.
i wish people would have more faith in general. 
faith in people, faith in the world and faith in themselves.
some people believe to think that people are generally born bad.
i like to think that people are born good.. its just the situations
and circumstances that has molded them to be something otherwise.
and instead of outcasting these people, embrace and pray for them.
as if they're not troubled enough..
they don't need more negativity encompassing their life.
prayers are answered.
i am not God, and i can't explain why things happen the way they do.
BUT FOR EVERY ACTiON, THERE IS A REACTiON..
God is never at blame for the way things work out but 
instead, we should have the understanding that 
nothing is a mystery or is left an open book..
everything does happen for a reason.

so once again, i do encourage those who stare at the closed door,
to get up and climb through the open window..
sometimes God gives us these hurdles and these obstacles
to test how much faith, hope and spirit we have in Him.
AND.. in ourselves.
life is an ongoing struggle, a battle.
sometimes against others, sometimes within yourself.
but live each day like there is no tomorrow because sometimes,
there isn't one. days shouldn't be wasted.
and i'm not a pessimist--
i'm just trying to speak whats real. or at least whats real to me.
live for the moment because once it pasts,
it's a lost chance to make a positive change for yourself.

love those around you, love life, love your enemies because the truth is--
the negativity IS what makes you stronger.
embrace even the bad, because the good can't be felt without it.
it's a natural emotion to feel pain, to feel like hurt has no end
sometimes my heart still drops thinking about situations in my short life
that i've come across over the years..
i realized t's okay to hurt but do not let that hurt run your life..
learn to overcome the pain and mend your OWN heart.
don't rely on those around you to stitch it up for you.
your heart is made to LOVE, not to wallow in the sufferring.
so wherever you go, have it open so others around you can 
can catch a little bit of your warmth.

it's true you can't change the whole world overnight
and i, myself am not perfect but i'm opening my eyes.
i'm opening my eyes to what i feel makes ME content.
and what makes ME content, is what i've just written.
by giving yourself this constant reminder that we are only human
and that we all share a common bond of pain, love, hope and faith
maybe the world will change one day..
give it time, and when you do change..
leave that door open for the rest of the world to follow..



ALMA-AMANDA.
02/05/05.


In loving memory.. Nanay Choleng, Chan McCoy, Patrick B.
MY LOVE &  PRAYERS ARE WiTH YOU ALL."

"event","so its been a real good minute since ive updated. well its officially 2005 and has been for... a while now. but i went to the philippines and my timing is all off. philippines was really wOW. something different. a new experience.  i mean, i may not have understood everything that was being said around me and it sucks because i really didnt get to communicate with my relatives that much. but i did find a deeper appreciation for what we have HERE. in the united states. man, people say the US is so fucked up, but you really dont know what fucked up is until you see it in the eyes of a country half way around the world.  i'm so appreciative of what my parents/grandparents etc. and ancestors before them have done in order for us to have all that we have. and my new years resolution is to cut down on SPENDING MONEY. which will be quite a task but now that i understand how WASTEFUL i've been, it's not even hard for me to let a cute jacket or nice kicks GO.

i'm a 0.5 unit away from getting my Associate in Arts degree in Liberal studies and that 0.5 is for PE.  my counselor told me that all pe is transferrable so it wouldnt matter what i take to fulfill that AA requirement. well.. it turns out it DOES matter and although all PE is transferrable, not all PE is eligible to fulfill that section of the AA requirement.  the semester already started, this week (friday is tomorrow) so yea, this week is the last week to add/drop and its too late to add and i've already dropped PHED 57 cuz its no use in taking a 3 unit course that will do me no good.  so here i am stressing over this 0.5 unit and the only way out is to get a waiver from a physician saying you cannot participate in physical activity. well wouldn't you f*cking know it. i have a jacked up back and see a chiropractor on the regular.  so he is my golden ticket for sure. and he already said he'd have a letter ready for me to turn into the counseling dept. so they can waive that mutherfucker. i'm really JUiCED.

all i have to do is finish this semester and i will have my 60 units ready to go and ready to be transferred to sac state.  i'm gonna miss home so much but at the same time i'm really excited to be out on my own and being closer to steven. how weird is that gonna be seeing him every day!! the longest i've seen him is .. i think 4 days in a row? but man, i wont be able to keep track anymore. cuz once i move out (which is in august), he'll be like my kick it friend all day every day. that is my heart, real talk! and i'm hoping his cousin crystal will have a room open for me if the other place we're looking into doesnt work out. 

i talked to my mom about it and she said if i want to stay at steven's cousin's house i can cuz she trusts me as long as the monthly is reasonable!! i love my mom so much and hearing those words coming from her means a lot. my mom really wants me to be on my own and feel what its like to be independent. or as she said, 'i want you to spread your wings and fly...' i love my mama! and my dad is excited for me too, but yall know my dad-- hes like a big kid so he aint even really trippen where i stay at either. they know they've raised me well enough to know that i can handle my business and have fun at the same time. my mom and my pops is seriously like my best friends. they been there for me through everything. i mean, yes they are parents and it's in their job description to raise their kids. but they've done more than that for us.  they are our FRiENDS and seriously, i dont know many out there (i know there are some out there), but i personally dont know many who can sit and kick it with their parents like theyre some homies. and i be fillin' them in on all the juice and all the latest drama thats been goin' on with me. i love my family, i really do!

i also love my girls. i mean, lately i been seein' more and more how much we done grew up together and i'm really glad that we all still managed to keep it together. we're all doing our own things, moving at our own paces, but no matter what-- the road still leads back to each other. i can always count on them to give me a good laugh when i aint feelin' too player or just chop it up and have a black when we wanna chill! they are my comfort zone!

so for now i'm just doing my thang and man.. call me mac dre cuz i'm really feelin' myself. like FOR SURE i am. i've got my head screwed on real tight and i'm not gonna slow the pace down until i pack up my shit and get on the road to sac this august!"

"event","so its been a real minute since i updated this thing.

well work is still moving right along. today i was really active and was running all over the place and it feels good to know you make a difference at a place. yea i know its just office max but its cool to know that you can be called on for help no matter where you are in the store and still know what the hell you're talking about!

school is great, man. i passed my assessment, i'm so grateful that i di because if i didnt, gauranteed i wouldve been at chabot for another semeseter. and i dont have to be, which is GOOD! next semester is killer, i'm taking 21 units, but after that i'll be able to relax for the summer until i start in the fall '05 wherever i may end up. 

Spring 2005 schedule.
mon, tues, wed, thurs, fri.

(3units) ENGLISH 38- SURVEY OF MODERN BRITISH LITERATURE (for my major)

(3units) PSYCHOLOGY 1- INTRO TO PSYCHOLOGY (just for units)

(3 units) GEOGRAPHY 1- NATURAL SCIENCE, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 
(for my section B req.)

(4 units) MATH 43- STATISTICS & PROBABILITY (for my transferrable math)

(5 units) SPANISH 1A- BEGINNERS SPANISH 
(but yall know i aint no beginner, easy A)

(3 units) PHYSED 57- NUTRITION & FAT LOSS (informational, but needed for my Associate in Arts degree in Liberal Studies. Only need .5 a unit but went for the GOLD!)

i swear imma be killin' myself.. but i must be feelin' myself cuz i got faith to do what i gotta do. i just realize its not so much of a NEED to do it, its more so of a 'I WANT TO DO IT.' cuz without that wanting it for myself, i wont be able to do it at all. i finally realized that i need to make these crucial steps, no matter how much its killin' me. or no matter how much i just want to shut out the world, pull the sheets over my head and float off into dreamland. i cant. aint nobody gonna do it for me, BUT ME. motivation comes from a lot aspects of my life. family, friends, steven, success, career, money. all of these things. but no matter where it may connectively come from-- ultimately, it's found within me. nobody's typing my papers for me, nobody is sitting their butt in my class, nobody is getting me up at 6 in the morning to make it to 730am class, nobody is losing sleep over school but ME. and its crucial, it is sometimes. but its also so satisfying that its all for a greater reason! yay!

so last time i updated, i said it was mine and steven's 2 years. yay for us! haha. he came down and we went to the city, took bart. it was fun. i made him a CD that has all the songs that remind me of him and each track i explained to him why i chose it and i labeled the CD, ""The Story of Us."" its cute. i'll have to put the list down of the songs one day. maybe later on in the week. but he liked it, he thinks i'm crazy but i guess. we didnt get each other gifts because we think that the gift in itself is just making it this far. who would've thunk it, honestly. and i'm still happy to be with him. hes really one of the most caring, loving, and kind persons i've ever met in my life! and he encourages me to be like that. ive toned down a lot. but yea-- we went to the city, and we didnt even buy anything! we ate at cheesecake factory and had outdoor seating when the sun was coming down and we were right under a heater. it was nice. so as we were eating, just talking and catching up-- the sun was going down and the lights in the city were coming on. so pretty!.. hmm.. sometimes we just look at each other and just cheese cuz its so hard not being able to see each other that when we are in front of each other, we just absorb everything and try to get over the fact that we're not on the phone but in person! haha.. then we'll get real quiet and remind ourselves that we should talk or something since we dont ever see each other. i miss him.

philippines is coming up, i'm getting hecka juiced. new places, excitement!

well i guess thats enough for now. i just got done writing a paper for ecology about why we shouldnt cut down trees. hahahahah. the ecological and scientifical aspects of it. not just the 'trees are our friends' deal. and we have a midterm tomorrow so i better go over these notes that charrie sent me. good night everyone and i'll update again soon. sorry it was bootsy but being on the daily grind has got me in this mode of just getting shit done and not turning back. 

PEACE OUT BEEZY!"

school is going okay. i ended up dropping out of math class cuz i really suck and i guess i think i'm invincible that i can take the assessment test and really get into stats & probability. supposedly, the answers i have will take me there but we'll see how we REALLY do. i'm freaking out liteweight, but if i fucked up, then i fucked up.. the only thing i can really do is just relax and if i get in, i do. if i dont-- i'm assed out, which means that sac state will have to wait until 20o6. damn, how sad does that sound.. VERY. i'm so sad right now about it.

but the thing is, no matter how long i'm taking to get to where i wanna go-- the fact of the matter is i'm getting there. no matter which road i'm taking, it's leading me to the same destination. and any way, i'm building character. all the struggles, are shaping me into ME. hahahahah, gosh aint i just a glass half full kinda beezie.

well i dont even feel like updating this shit. so i'm done

"event","i'm seriously catchin' the lazies since i been off for like 3 days.. ive learned how to balance and manage my time between work, school and everything that now that i have this extra time, i'm like damn, what do i do now? thats the way the cookie crumbles i guess. quick thoughts..

i really hate when people claim theyre your friends, but are quick to turn around and throw salt on my name like we aint even cool like that. but even if the person says, 'i didnt mean it like that' fact of the matter is, you said it and no matter if you didnt MEAN IT ""like that"".. you still SAID IT ""like that.""

and seriously. how many times do you let shit ride about 'friends' saying stuff behind you until you realize.. maybe they're not really friends? trust me, its no bitter feelings. its just a realization that i can make my life a whole lot easier by not caring WHO says, WHAT they say, when they said it. because really, the content of what they speak aint even half the truth. its just all this unnecessary drama that i really don't need. just learn to keep my name outcha mouth and i promise everythang will be really cool. as patsy would say, ""Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'..""

i think, people really need to address situations before they assume what is real and what isn't real. because then you only have half the story, completely unaware of the other half, and because of this unknown-- you're automatically wrongfully passing judgement on a situation or a person, that may not even deserve it.

but anyway, fact it-- once, twice, three times sold. its really time that i recognized the faultiness you bear because i've seen it in these past years but decided to leave it alone cuz that's just how you are. i truly believe that we all carry faults and qualities that others don't like, or that we ourselves don't like-- but i've learned to embrace those qualities anyway because acceptance is better than forceful change in a person or yourself. BUT, just because ""that's just how you are"" doesn't justify it at all. and as long as you aren't ""justifying"" yourself about ME, then do what you do. by all means, say what you say but for the last time, don't speak my name. i'd really appreciate it.

this ain't even really directed towards any of you guys in specific. just someone else. this is more so of a reminder for myself to get up, get out and move on to better things to come. and i really don't feel like it's necessary to address the situation one on one with the person because we've had issues like this is the past and we've discussed that if we had somethin' to say, we would say it to each other DiRECTLY. none of this TLC action, creepin' on the down low cuz nobody else supposed to know. but really the ONE person who should know how you feel (ME), doesn't. and something is very wrong with that. so the other person on the end of this situation hasn't lived up to that commitment of being direct. and honestly, at this point it's a lost cause to discuss it or try to salvage what is left, because there really isn't anything left to save.

you know how people say it's easier to be positive than to waste energy being negative?? that is SO TRUE. and do not get me wrong, i am not being negative, but rather keeping the negativity away from me. and maybe this person didn't have negative intentions (which i'm really sure he didn't). but if you're making me feel negative about myself and those around me, then i apologize but i can't be around to experience it anymore.

i do love everyone around me and those who have been there regardless of my imperfections and flaws. and those who recognize the fact that i AM NOT perfect and still take me as i am. friendship is give and take and a lot of time, energy, compassion and consideration is invested into it. it takes years to build it up and if shit gets shady enough, it can take a second to tear it all down. i DO appreciate those who have the courtesy to come to me and talk to me about things no matter how rough or shaky things may be and being courageous enough to face situations at hand. i DO NOT however, have much respect for those who choose to pass judgement on situations they do not fully understand. and i do not understand why people say things without knowing what's on the otherside of the hill. i wish that people would take the time out to recognize that maybe it wasn't your concern to begin with??? and maybe realizing that this isn't high school and ""you stole my cookie"" shit is real old.

well it is the weekend and have a good one! i'll update later on.

"event","dude, today was such an off day. it honestly REALLY was. i wasnt thinking straight at all and its not like i dont know what its about. its just that i cant focus when we share the same shifts. this is the first time we've shared a full shift together. usually, he'll be getting there the hour before i'm leaving. or vice versa. or we'll just try to completely stay clear off each others' paths. but anyway, some guy bought $1300 worth of merchandise. a computer bundle, digital camera and the extended warranties to go along with them. and i was like damn cool shit we need this sale really bad. i was so nervous cuz HE was by me and like, acknowledging my presence and everything and it made my heart race like damn i didnt know what to do but i tried to be cool or whatever. cuz you know. well, no you dont. but i got sorta panicky. i didnt even check the guy's ID or anything. didnt even really look at his credit card i was so nervous. damn that's my job on the line right there. but what can i do, its all said and done with now. God, please help me. i'm such a spazz.

"event","well i swear this week flew. 2004 in itself flew. lemme just update the week.

well yesterday i went to english, i've been getting my ass up at 6 in the morning to handle all my shit and get to school. and for that i deserve a round of applause cuz you know i dont get up for nothin' or nobody. ive really learned how to prioritize and i think its absolutely fantabulous. HA!

me and charrie had a fieldtrip to the museum. HECKA work! i aint never paid fuckin' money to a museum just to take notes and work my ass off. now what is the fun in that. and to top it off, we're not done. we still have to write an essay based on what we saw at the museum. 

after that, me and charrie met up with kazz and janice at olive garden. we were dancing because our appetizer was free since they took long to bring it out. only fuckin' heffers like us would clap their hands, dance and throw their fists in the air for a free appetizer. we ate and then we were in the parking lot hella crackin jokes about last names!! cater-ting! chu-gum! chu-ing! chu-bacca! chu-good! hahahaha i swear janice you got the best last name ever.

i went to stoneridge myself after that and bought my akademiks skirt. thank GOD it was still there. its so pretty. i really like it. i went to my chiropractor and got my back adjusted. i swear it feels good once he relieves all the knots and stress that builds up in my back. then me, janice and moey went all the way to hilltop for nothing! almost nothing. but i ended up buying a triple 5 zipup sweater. mo bought some pepejeans and janice bought some GUNiT jeans!!! haha off the hook.

then we went to kazz's and we braided her hair cuz today she was set to take pictures and she wanted her hair wavy. so you know, if janice went by herself she wouldve had kazz lookin tore up. so me and mo did MOST the work and janice did like, two braids.. we made her take pictures cuz she was lookin' like snoop. WEST SIDE!

after that we went to porkys pizza and that shit was so fuckin funny. i swear we be hella hungry and once we get the food we hella arent. but we tore it up pretty good and were doing rock, paper, scissors to see who had to take home the leftovers. cant even explain it but that shit was HIL-ARE-EE-US. seriously!

after that we kicked it in the lot haha. just reminiscin' about the good times and just thinkin' about how we all still stayed tight thru the years and still are close. no matter how far kazz is, or how much we're off doing our own things, our roads still lead to each other. good stuff.

today i didnt do shit cuz i was hella lazy. i was gonna get my hair trimmed and relayered but i got hella lazy and ended up falling asleep. i woke up and picked up michelle from SL, took her home to change and then took her to john muir cuz she was gonna teach the cheer squad over there some cheers. 

huey called me and said he was coming home to the bay! and i was surprised cuz this fool said he wasnt gonna come back until 2 weeks from now. so i was juiced cuz i been so busy and this time i had nothing to do and i havent chilled with him in so long. so he was gonna go get a haircut or whatever and i had to do some shit anyways at marshall's and pick up my new schedule for next week. so we decided to set up somethin' to do. i drove over to his house and we went to eat at guadalajara. good stuff, couldnt even finish it tho, it was too much to handle! you know-- you dont really realize how much you miss someone until theyre there with you. when he lived in the bay we liteweight took each other for granted, or at least i did, cuz i knew he was right there in my own city. but now that he's out at UCSC, its kinda like i see the people i value in my life. and i really have to say that he means A LOT to me. we've come a long way, no real drama, just a lotta history, but we been there for each other for hella shit if i think about it. we're real open with each other and folks like that dont come along every day. everytime we kick it its just the same as it was the last time we did and we have never really fell off. i'm glad we finally had the chance to sit and talk and just chill cuz who knows when the next time for that is gonna be. REAL TALK! 

but its been a cool day and its time for me to chill and maybe try to get some work done. but i been feelin' lazy a f*ck today. no work, no school. you really dont feel like doing anything else but sitting ya ass at home. it feels good.

ONE MORE DAY 'TiL US 5 HiT SAC!! COME ON NOW, LETS DO iT LiVE YALL. AINT NO OTHER WAY TO DO iT! iTS KAZZ'S LAST NIGHT CHILLEN. GET JUICED. CARPE DiEM!!!! hahaha.

have a good weekend everyone and stay SAFE!"

i'm blessed to have had you in my life and will never forget all the memories we've had together. thru elementary, middle school and high school. its rare that you keep friends thruout these times in life and you were one of the few friends that i kept for so long. sometimes, thinking about it gets me down and how you're not here with us any more. but i remind myself how fortunate i am to have had you in my life and i wouldnt trade any of it for the world. you have given me the greatest gift-- to let myself live my life each day and to embrace who i am as a person. the good and the bad. just as unique as you were, you remind me that i am ME in my own way and own right and that nobody else in the world is like me! 

i miss you all the time and i know that you watch over me and everyone every day.. i just want to say thank you for keeping me safe and for being that reminder that life is a gift from God and to cherish it. i love you, chan and thank you.. happy birthday!"

"event","yesterday was a good day besides the fact that work gave me a full 8 hour shift. its all good tho cuz i'm not working today! day off and i'm juiced.. 

well after work, after i went to marshalls and bought some cool stuff. haha, i stay on them DEALS! but yea, i went home, changed up out my work clothes and headed over to union city.. KAZZ is back home from laughlin AirForce Base in TX to visit! she came back yesterday. so we decided to eat at texas roadhouse. it was me, moey, kazz and janice. nia was in LA for the weekend or something.

so we HELLA ate and stopped by the liquor store to pick up candy and shit. on the way there we were just hella talkin and laughin, like old times! i absolutely miss it! i stayed cheesin', had a dumb ass smile on my face but i guess that's just what my girls do to me!

afterwards just chilled in FRONT OF tapioca express. cuz that shit was a little too crackin' to be sitting in front of it. first time i ever seen that line stretch outside the door. WOAH, it was too weird. hella choppin it up and reminiscin about the times we had! i swear we used to be some crazy people.. we still are but there's just stuff that we just dont do no more! but man, we really had some good times.. and i'm just TOO JUiCED for sac next weekend. the big 5 doin' it live one more time! thats when nene will be back from so.cal, so it should be hella fun. cuz even tho when we be out there kickin it with the sac boys-- we never really do anything extravagant but we ALWAYS make it fun one way or another. except for that ONE TiME when we got that hotel up in the cuts and we were REALLY dressed up with nowhere, i mean NOWHERE to go.

afterwards, we went to janices and was hella bustin' up with our phone calls and shit. hahahaha, we are off the hook. you got problem?! you got a beef? YOU CHEAT ME, SWEETHEART! haha. but yea, just wanted to say hi and i miss my girls and this should be a good week comin' up! live it up yall cuz MiSS KAZZY is here for a limited time only!

and thanks to moey and janice for having my back friday night when shit was gettin' real faulty for me. no other girls would drop their food and be up for a long drive, in their work clothes and everything! thank you guys SO MUCH for being there for me thru everything and i know that i can count on any of yall for anything i ever needed. and vice versa.. you know alms got you guys too.

"event","i'm so tired out of my mind right now. last night i spent all my time, catching up on all the work i said i would. i did a little bit of everything. finished my essay and you know me and how i need my papers to be just right and shit. tip: flow is one of the most important parts of an essay. if your paragraphs ain't got it, gaurantee your paper will sound hella choppy. bottom line, it'll be shit.

but i sat there and proofread and proofread and proofread until i felt my eyes were gonna fall out. picked up the ecology work and got straight to that. i didnt turn off the computer until 6am. at that point, i layed down in the front room, fell asleep for like 5 minutes, went up stairs, fell asleep for another 15 and then woke up at 6:28am cuz i was too scared that if i were to fall asleep, it would be CURTAiNS for my ass! all that work on the essay, on the studying for the midterms, would have went

straight

down

the 

drain.

but i'm happy now cuz i'm at home. fresh off of midterms.. meaning, knowing i wont have one for another two weeks or so. thank the good lord. i do have to catch up on the grapes of wrath and try to finish it. and also read ch 7 of my sociology book. so many things to do, so little time! but i'm really glad that i'm keeping myself focused because i really feel driven in finding my niche in life.

i'm really curious as to what my career path will end up at but i'm sure whatever it is will be something that i love. i found my motivation. my determination. and i'm proud of myself, damn it! and i'm glad that i did because its really hard when there's so many every day things that try to hold you back. but nOooO, not me. i'm doin' what i'm doin and i'm doin' it like i'm doin it for TV! i applied to csu sac and i'm really excited about going there cuz i heard their english program is really good. i also might get my teaching credentials in a single subject so i can maybe TEACH if i decide to! excitement! the more i think about that campus, the more im set on thats where i wanna go! but i'm gonna apply other places, probably sf state, just in case. i just wish they'd hurry up and let me know what the deal is!

man, my eyes are just fuckin' drooping right now. but despite the fact i'm running on 15 minutes sleep. i did ok on my tests. i did better in math than i thought i would! 

its really time to me to lay down and chill cuz these fingers are a-typin' with not a clue about what i'm a-sayin. i'll update later with something more interesting. i know this entry was pretty shotty. 

but give me a nice long our of miss oprah winfrey on the boob tube, a good couple hours asleep on the ol' pile of hay, wake up-- grab myself a hot cup of joe and turn me on some 40-watta-watta and i'll be back to myself in a jiff.

peace, yall."

"event","hey ya'll. its like 7:02pm right now and i am SWAMPED with a lot of work to do. ive got our second midterm for math coming up and i know it's gonna kick my ass so i need to really buckle down and make something happen. i just NEED credit for it so i can advance to 40 and i'll be finally DONE with it since no other math is required for my major! then, i have our second midterm in ecology that i need to study for, lectures 7-12 but i think i can handle cuz the last midterm we had i got an A! i just need to sit down with the notes and do it, MEMORiZE. then i have an english essay to write due on thursday ALSO so i gotta get crackin' on that. but you know me and essays, i'm trippen now but when i sit down to write it, shit'll flow like water. and i gotta read up to CH. 18 in The Grapes of Wrath. which i was SUPPOSED to have did but felt hella moded in class, expecting my english instructor NOT to call on me and surprirse surprise: she did. and i gotta read CH. 6 of my socio book and take a quiz online by the end of the night but i can hang..  its all good.. stuff happens sometimes but i'm determined to get it all done!

the reason why i'm so behind is cuz it was my dad's birthday this weekend (sunday was the party!) and it was off the chain. i had a lotta fun and people who came had fun. good food and stuff! i didnt get to invite all my friends tho cuz well, its not my birthday and 200 people came and seats were kinda limited.. but a few came. janice helped a lot thru-out the whole thing so thanks, girl. thats my adopted sister. i didnt even really even get to talk to any of my girls there! moey, nia or mondeez.. but i guess that's how it goes when you're part of the 'party planning.' but thank you guys for coming, i really do appreciate it. i was just running around and stuff since it was my dad's birthday. good times tho. steven came and i'm glad he did, he was helping me out a lot too. my right hand man. never complains when i need him to do something. and it's really the best that we can still make each other hella laugh over the craziest things. and he aint afraid to dance! maybe cuz he can. thats important. he bought a new car, a cutlas supreme- hecka nice. i like it and he didnt tell me he bought it cuz he thought i wouldn't like it. but i do. foreal tho-- that's my piece right there! we decided to stop bullshitting and get back together cuz that's where our hearts are at, with each other. i just needed to snap that into myself. i realized i really dont have to be nice to every dude that comes my way. i mean i understand now that i can have friends, but i be tryin to be HELLA friends and thats way overboard and i admit that. he always been there and he rides or dies for me in every way, i really can't ask for more. going on two years, ya'll. aint that sumthin!? nov. 17th so keep it on the calendar. HA!

one of the best things about the party-- before my dad started his THANKYOUs and all that. my brother mark grabbed the mic from him and started chasing around his girlfriend, ros while she was passing out the cake. he said, ""ros, can i can i ask you a question?"" in front of everyone there. and she was like flippin' out and shit. but point is, this man got down on one knee and asked her to marry him! aint that something! ..that's really the sweetest. and the ring is absolutely amazing! baller status, man. she's already part of the family but now she'll REALLY be a part of the family! they are the best together and they been together since '98. so, its about time. i'm really excited for them and their future plans for the wedding! and they're already in the middle of buying a house! excitement! congratulations, you two.

okay in the beginning of this i said 'quick post.' but yea right.. i knew it wasn't gonna be that quick. but i gotta get crackin on this work suff for school.

i'm thinking about quitting office max and putting in my two weeks. because i really need to spend my extra time studying cuz i want to make grades and make them GOOD. not just mediocre. sOoo, maybe its time to retire the blue shirt and khakis so that way i can focus further on future dreams. cuz i cant be at office max forever. i wanted to keep it so i can take it with me to CSUS, near arden area. but maybe it's best if i just make a complete change and find a different side job. we'll see! but definitely for spring 2005 i gotta cut back the hours. maybe i should just cut back the hours now? should i? and i'm going to the philippines in dec. so i dont know. but i do like having that extra bread in my pocket. money talks, man.. money talks."

"event","man, so i know i'm allergic to shrimp. this i know. well i know now. last summer '03 when me and the fam went to vegas, i ate HELLA cocktail shrimp like there was no tomorrow. shit, its a buffet so i'm gonna get the money's worth, you feel me. but as we were leaving the treasure island buffet, i started feeling hella hot and shit like something was wrong and i began to itch.

so..pretty much. my whole body was swollen with hives and it was so bad that my skin swelled and enclosed over my eyes and i couldnt even see anything. my throat was also swollen,  blocked my respiratory and vocal passage so when i tried to talk nothing would come out. luckily, emergency was down the strip from where we were staying and they ejected me in my ass and back of the arm with some adrenaline and hormones. doc said i was lucky cuz once my throat would completely close, i would have died. THOUGHT i LEARNED MY LESSON..

but i'm in love with shrimp. thats what i tell myself. i love you, shrimp. i cant be without you. never was allergic until about 3 years ago and i dont understand it. yesterday at work i brought some alfredo ravioli with shrimp.. and damn, i told myself 'just one shrimp.' man, once you pop, you really can't fuckin stop. but i ended up eating the whole thing. about 14 pieces of shrimp. yea, so what i'm a fatty girl. 45 minutes later, started freakin' out the same way i did in vegas. but this time i had more reaction time to know what was happening to me.

told my manager lorenzo that i had to leave cuz i was having an allergic reaction and he told me to go and he'll count my register down for me. couldnt find my mom. didnt have my adrenaline shot pen that i need to stab myself in the leg with whenever this happens. didnt have my car cuz of the old guy who hit my shit. didnt have my house keys cuz i got dropped off to work. so i was assed out. called my brother max and luckily he was on his way home from work. he was doin' 100 on the freeway just to get to me. the cops was on him but luckily there was an accident right next to my brother in one of the lanes so the cop had no choice but to stop. thank god for good brothers.

so he took me home, at this point, i'm really swelling and i tend to panic cuz i know that my life can hang in the balance everytime this happens. so i guess i was major freakin' out cuz i was holding the shot upside down.. its kind of like a pen-- one side has the click that ignites the needle, the other side is the needle. i had it upside down with the click near my thigh and the needle was inside pointed towards my thumb. when i tried to stab myself in the leg, it set off the trigger and the needle shot into my thumb. REALLY FREAKiN' OUT NOW.

i couldnt pull it out cuz it was jabbed all the way into the innerbone of my thumb and my brother max was just standing there with his jaw hangin' out like what the fuck. i was like 'get it out, get it out, get it out!' i didnt even feel any pain because i was in shock. 

so as much as he didnt want to do it, me and him were tugging on that needle until it budged and all this blood started spewing everywhere. have you ever seen 'the adams family' movie? where wednesday and her fat brother are on stage at the talent show and they're slicing each other up and shit and blood is just spraying into the audience? well it wasnt that serious, but it was just drippin' out like a faucet.

so after i inject myself with the epinephrine, my whole body starts to shake like i'm on speed. which is what the doctor explained to me will happen when i ignite the needle. almost immediately, i felt a change in my face and it was fighting off the virus that was attacking my body. i laid down and my brother got me a benadryl and i couldnt even stop shaking while i was drinking water to wash it down.

my mom came home, all smiles and shit cuz she aint got a DAMN clue whats going on. she was expecting me to be at work still she was supposed to pick me up at 540 and it was just 410 or something. so she MADE me go to emergency and i was all wrapped up in a blanket with still my yellow ass name fuckin' badge on. reading ""ALMA"" so all the fools at kaiser can laugh at me and say look at that girl, ""ALMA"" with the swollen face and ugly work clothes. 

i really could care less than a shit though cuz i was hella drowsy and i just wanted to be alright. so we ended up staying there 'til almost 9 o' clock. they be laggin'! i hate emergency.. i bet if someone ran up in there with hella gun shot wounds, they'd tell him, 'its cooool. dont worry. just take a seat, sit, relax. get your hair braided and read a magazine or take a cool little nap 'til we call your name.""  all while the man is struggling to stay alive! or at least  until a nurse is ready to see him and make him wait 10 more hours.

shrimp? we are so breaking up. it was a nice, long relationship.. but you're hurting me and i can't take it no more. we REALLY, i mean really can't keep doing this. it isn't right. so goodbye and PEACE OUT, you little shits who can't stop breakin' my heart! we're so done.

thanks brother for taking care of your little sis."

"event","so friday, the 24th.. i was driving to work to pick up my paycheck. just like any other day. nothin' new. threw on some clothes, some kicks, headed over to officemax to pick it up.  so i pass loards ice cream going towards marina square and come to that stoplight at the intersection. busy day, it was 3o'clock so you know everyone and they mama is tryin to get home. so at the intersection of marina and teagarden.

i have a red. me and the rest of the cars are waiting for our green.  it turns green. i check the intersection to make sure there arent any last minute fuckers tryin to get over on the yellow-red change.  there aren't any. so i go and 3/4 into the intersection a white truck comes out of nowhere and clips me in the front and we have a fat ass collision. i mean FAT. 

i sat there for a minute not even knowing where i was. you know that feeling of de ja vu? and some nice lady was nice enough to come see if i was okay just sitting there in my fucked up ass car in the middle of the intersection.  so i get out and she helps move my car to the side. behind where the guy who was driving the white truck was.

so the guy, is like-- ancient. 80-years-old, i'd say. and god bless you that you have a long and healthy life but you really should not be driving. now i aint one to knock older folks. shit, if you can smib a car, smib it. but if you drive around running red lights all day every day, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DMV. take away their license! 

and wouldnt you fuckin' know it. when the cops came.
this man tried to change up the story like he aint hit shit.
please, RED LIGHT--STOP. GREEN LIGHT--GO.
THERE IS NO ""RED LIGHT-- HIT THE GAS AND HIT THE POOR GIRL TRYING TO GET HER PAYCHECK.""

kinkos. la salsa. and starbucks came out and made sure i was cool. i couldnt even dial the number to call the police, i was shaking so bad.  so then all i could do is call my mom cuz my mom is superwoman and all and she honestly has the answer to everything. i told her to get her ass over to where i was ASAP and she came.. thank god for MOMS!

jonathan came out to see the damage (better you, than me) is what he said. which is fucked up. but he said it later that night which still made me upset because why would you even say that. even if he knew i was okay, its the PRiNCiPLE. and patrick C. thanks for staying and rubbing my back to make me feel better. haha. and jennifer came out to make sure i was okay and everything was cool. thanks to officer nguyen-delgado and officer deguzman. and thanks to random lady on the street with the mullet cut. thanks to good samaritan witnesses. thanks to kinkos for making the cop-call. THANKS yall. i think i'm truly blessed to have all these people around me that cared so much about me. and the guy driving next to me when it happened and the guy driving behind the other guy when it happened were nice enough to come back around and give me their business cards. cuz they KNEW it wasnt my fault. SHIT WAS RED, MAN!

i'm still upset. mostly because the financial aspect of it all cuz lord knows that i dont pay for my car note, or insurance, or gas. and here's another chunk of change that my parents have to deal with. but theyre not mad cuz they know it wasnt even my fault and we have good insurance. my record is good too so i'm alright. and as long as i'm still here, breathing.. that's all that matters. and i can receive up to $25,000 in health coverage insurance since fool was the one who did me wrong. but we'll see if he can cover my damages! cuz thats whats really all bad! i have a feeling he doesnt have a good plan. and steven and janice, thanks for making sure i was alright. even tho janice you was all trippen out and worried but i know its only cuz you love me and i'm your brain when you aint got one. which is almost always.

so.. right now we're assed out one car short. no car for me. the engine is still running, we just have to get fixed the whole front end cuz shit is smashed up, BAD. and i called in sick today cuz i really didnt feel like being there. and i just didnt wanna go thru all that hassle of getting a ride to work and beig picked up even tho i technically live  3 blocks down.  my back hurts sometimes and my knees are jacked up cuz i flew up when our cars collided. i'm just glad that God put people around me that are so compassionate and understood the situation. And I thank God that he had people watching over me.  i was pretty shaken up but i still am just blessed that i came out the same ol' alms. i appreciate this life, and i never have taken it for granted and after now- i still wont take it for granted! you never know what could have happen, it could have been worse. damn and it had to be on a mainstreet corner in SL so everyone and their mom that knows me can point and have the look on their face like, ""Is that Alma??""

"event","<P>just want to give a quick shoutout to steven, who's blessed to be here on his 20th birthday! boy done been thru a lotta struggle and of course there will be more to come. BUT i thank god that he gave him a second chance at life and he's still good-hearted and grateful and still doin' it live! 

and.... this also marks the day that me and my girls fell in love with SAC! 
remember that first day yall? lets take it back.</P>
<P>Late September, 2002.<BR>Ronnell says there's a function. What function? FOR ""stevo's"" birthday.<BR>We don't even know any of them. Or where we're gonna stay?<BR>HMMM should we go? Oooh, blossom DEFiNiTELY CAN'T MAKE iT.<BR>alms: but i just got my license?! hmm.. should i take the accord anyway.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i really don't know if that shit can fly that far.<BR>the girls say: we'll put air in the tires, check the water and stuff and get a carwash! <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shit, we'll be fine. just like brand new!</P>
<P>SO WE DO iT. me, nia, kazz, janice and moey. all packed up in a little gray 91 accord. with cheez-its, grapes and shit all ready to go. decked out in pajama pants, white tees and sweaters. pillows, blankets, overnight bags, YOU NAME iT. if people on the freeway didn't know any better, they'd swear we were goin' to reno.</P>
<P>so we take the drive. i drive first, mind you-- just getting my license about two months before. and i aint even scared or nothin. ""its just like driving around the bay, but for REALLY long and for REALLY straight,"" I tell myself. and shit, what yall know about the yahoo point by point driving directions!</P>
<P>SO we drive, eating our snacks cuz we fat like that. and finally, we get to the elk grove exit sign! AiNT NEVER BEEN SO JUICED TO SEE AN ELK GROVE SiGN iN MY LiFE! we keep driving, follow the directions given to us and we trippen cuz we look like straight up messes. like we done ate hella snacks with crumbs all over our shirts so we were in DESPERATE need of some mirrors and a place to change.</P>
<P>first, we need more snacks! moey drives my car over to walgreens and we stock up.<BR>NOW we need a place to change.</P>
<P>JACK iN THE BOX. that will definitely do.</P>
<P>so we stroll up in there, like we OWN the place. duffle bags and everythang. curling iron, make-up, hairspray and gel. jeans, shirts, socks, kicks, the muthafuckin' WORKS! two stall bathroom, with barely any walking space once we get up in there. and we're just all excited and shit runnin' around like there were spiders crawling up our asses. so its like 'fuck it.' NO. WE CANNOT have any iNTERRUPTiONS. lock that muthafuckin' door!</P>
<P>so we're movin'. we're workin'. we're doin' what it takes to get the job done cuz these SAC boys could be calling any minute for us to come thru! plugged in the curling iron, changed the clothes, did the hair, did the make-up. did the WORKS. and came out looking like movie stars. had fools staring at us like WHO THE FUCK ARE THESE GiRLS and why they go in lookin' like shit and comin' out lookin' like they celebrities with the stunners on and shit. HAHAHAHA, i swear that was the best.</P>
<P>we mustve been real juiced cuz we threw everything into the back of my trunk, iNCLUDING the KEYS TO THE CAR and then closed it... damn alms, NO YOU REALLY DIDN'T. no keys, no drive. no drive? no home. but luckily i had my tripleA card and we got to use it, so the locksmith came and hooked me up REAL nice. thank god for triple a.</P>
<P>so, still no go from the guys.. no call, no anything. but we finally get in touch with steven and ronnell and they're still not ready yet. or at least they were roundin' up the troops getting everything together.&nbsp; so we go eat at this pizza place by the theather cuz we were hungry like that and i dont even know what we ordered but i guess it was okay. </P>
<P>now it wasnt even crackin' in the pizza place until after we left and went back to the car in the lot. YOU KNOW iT, just HAD to bump the big tymers! 'gator boooooots.. with a pimped out gucci suuuuuuit..."" oh man, the list doesn't STOP. mustve been gettin loose in the lot with our blacks in our hands. thinkin' we're just so fuckin' rad cuz we're from the bay and shit! man, we're fuckin hilarious. AND to top off the situation, we took pictures in front of the theaters like we were straight up tourists from fuckin' japan or somethin'! with the stunners on, by the way. so finally..</P>
<P>steven, hova, ronnell and jordan? was it jordan? whoever it was mustve not really mattered. (do any of you girls remember?) but whoever it was, they came up in the durango.. and we mustve QUiT our bullshit REAL QUiCK. and tried to act all cool and shit like we were just chillen.. so finally, we're on our way.</P>
<P>by this time, it's already getting dark and we head over to ronnell's house to chill. he said we could spend the night at the house so we had all our stuff in the trunk for later.&nbsp; lets pretty much leave that night, to that night.. but some quick highlights:</P>
<P>big jamiel's handfuls of grapes. cheez-its, ""no crumbs on the bed!"" ..""SO INTERNATIONAL"" at least until the lights come back on. AAAHH! black and milds all day, every day. morris and the breakdancing, just PLEASE stop-- that is quite enough with your jocelyn enriquez and techno! FEFE making moey run around from room to room all night. GUS trying to share the blankets with yall. nuh-uh sweetie, ya better getcha own! pan de sal sandwiches in a big ass black trashbag. gone in sixty seconds and shit with the way they eat! janice..""i gotta take a shit.. please take me to the theater."" WHAT, bitch? you got shit fucked up! hahaha. CURLY SUES!! bacardi O. off that drank! KAZZ to worlds, ""daaaamn nigga, you are just all up in my ZONE!"" hahaha. </P>
<P>the list GOES ON. but just wanted to give a shout to our very first day and let yall know that we really did have the best of times! salute to that and remember we got plenty of more to create! i love you beezies.</P>"

"event","the confines of my mind, aged like wine, with time..
trapped inside like a sun's shine. its kinda funny..

i cant explain the way, it-- splits the decision in two
sometimes even three, why me-- what can i do
the mind says quit but the heart says go,
motivation, hesitation, relaxation-- i don't know

you don't know what you've got 'til its gone,
but deceivin' two worlds is the ultimate wrong.
tender aged, filled with rage, let me be saved..
its kinda funny..

pushin' away, knowin' i can NOT stay, 
if i could, then i would--i'd give it away to two
but like i said, sometimes even three.
but thats just me, my soul is free

but what is the heart. they say it doesnt lie.
it doesnt lie, it doesnt lie, but i CRY.
constantly on the struggle, for the truth
its kinda funny..

after all the tears, my fears are encompassin'
wonderin'-- if the path i'm on is correct.
let me check, catch my breath, wait a sec.
there's no tellin..

so the heart doesnt lie, nor can you rush it.
hangin' on, time is slippin', but really must it?
never one decision. 
sometimes its even three its kinda funny..

so i say, every day, said steady in word play--
cease the day, always pray, these moments do not stay
but they will always be remembered, so take it's worth
for the Earth-- is not forever..

love to live, live to love, laughter is life..
fuck the struggle, fuck the games, overcome strife.
this is YOUR life, but i share it with you..
so pursue--this TiME. owe yourself, its overdue.

the heart is not forever. but really, its the soul
lives on, carries on, til you're gone, its neverending..
so live each day, make decisions that you see
and make it fast, follow a path..
even if it's sometimes three.

"event","well its like 7:50am and ALREADY, already, ALREADY the day is starting off hella hectic. first off, my mom pushes open my door like a madman and i turn over hella sleepy, thinking, 'where's the fire at! DAMN!' and the only thing she has to say is, 'did you use the computer last night, its on lock mode and i don't know what to do!' like its life or death..and i was like, mom.. i wasnt even home until later and i didnt even use it. soOoo.. she exits. i roll over and continue my sleep business.

THEN, i go downstairs cuz i don't want her fussing with something she doesnt know about.. and she's SO scared that if we shut it off and turn it back on it's gonna crash the system and it's gonna develop more viruses (see, this is what shit like 20/20, dateline and the 11 o' clock news has an influence on). but whatever, problem solved-- she called her friend at work and apparently if you leave the computer on for a long time it goes into lock mode that only the registered administrator of the computer can unlock. 

then, i hear my dad say, 'AWWWWW SHiT.' and we have granite top tables in the kitchen, spotted like browns/blacks/tans.. whatever. so it would just naturally camoflauge a bunch of ants, obviously. and i guess there was a fat ass ant trail all over the table top where the sink is and lemme tell you-- i really hate ants. i REALLY do. so you know i was putting my work in Raid-ing the hell out of 'em. so i did that.. and mind you- this was all at 6 in the morning until 7 am. 

its REALLY JUST ONE OF THOSE DAYS! where everything sucks. but hey, you can't do anything about it but shrug it off and put a smile on! no big deal.

today me and janice are heading out to monterey and it should be fun. work on the tan! especially janice cuz we all know shes white as hell. and me, yea-- i need to work on that sunBLOCK cuz you know i can get hella dark. we don't really have an itenerary but we're gonna for sure walk the cannery row, visit the aquarium, hit the beaches and go swimming where we're staying. we can't decide whether we wanna stay at seaside holiday inn express (which is where we've already made reservations) or in monterey clarion hotel (where it has the balcony we want).. we'll figure it out. but i'm excited, still haven't packed so i should just get on the move and do that!

so we'll be on the road, pray for us that we don't get lost and that we make it there safely. and please pray that we have a safe trip back! even though it's not far, you never really know and knowing that you guys are thinking about us, helps out! it really does. well love and peace everyone, enjoy your week..

i think we're gonna go to modesto on friday to hang out with richard (backstreet), jerry and maine and i'm excited! i need to kick it with 'em. i miss those guys!"

"event","this is my very last week of summer school for this semester. 
i've already finished my religions of the world course and that 
went pretty well and philosophy will be even better 
and that ends this week! 
i'm hecka excited because i only fell victim to my sleeping habits 
TWICE! but other than that, i went to school, got my ass up 
every tuesday, wednesday and thursday morning 
just so i can make it on time at 8 am. i'm damn proud of myself!

there is this girl, however, who is habitually late EVERY DAY and i really don't understand cuz when i park my car in the lot, i walk by her damn car EVERY morning and she's just sitting there.. not doing shit but sitting and then strolls in to class about 15 minutes late. i really don't understand why people are late just to be late. and to top it off, she takes the long way walking to class when she clearly has great parking cuz she is illegally parked in the staff's lot.  she's a weird one, she really is.

i can't believe i managed to keep focus in summer school 
with all the crap that has been going on lately. 
me and steven have broken up (i know i must've said that 
a million times before) but we really have. we really need to give 
each other space, but most of all so he can find his niche in life. 
or at least work towards finding it out.  i dont want him to feel like 
he's just getting by, i want him to feel like what he does 
is important to his self because if he doesn't believe 
in what he does, nobody else will. 
i feel like me supporting him is not enough and that he needs to 
stand on his own two feet and find out. its kinda the saying, 
you gotta help yourself before you help others. 
it sounds selfish-- i know, but you know what i mean. 
it's hard to make a relationship work when you, yourself 
needs work first. and then theres just other controversy with 
another guy that is just bananas.. and i dont know! its just too 
much to say. but you can ask me if you want but i'm not gonna 
publicize it here! haha

man, work has been hella coo for the past week and a half 
because fiona's snotty ass attitude (sales manager) 
hasn't been around.  our store manager went on vacation 
to jersey cuz thats where her family is at. and then all of a sudden
fiona had to go to jersey too, but for a funeral. i felt bad because 
she was really quiet the day before her flight was out and i told her 
to have a safe flight but in the brattiest voice she said ""I'll try..."" 
i mean, i know things aren't going well for you right now, 
but you really don't have to take out your frustration on other people.
i hate when people misplace their anger 
on people who really don't deserve it. 
especially people who are trying to wish you well flying
out across the country.  and you figure, you REALLY figure, 
that she'd let her attitude subside for a minute, knowing that 
someone she cares about passed away 
and just try to SHOW A LiTTLE HEART. 
sometimes i find her so unhuman with such 
little emotion for other people. 
and i don't know how she can carry on her attitude. 
seems like every day is a bad day for her. and when she is 
having a good day she's gotta mess it up for me by saying, 
""oookay alma, you're on crack."" 
bitch please, you're on crack. 
that really bites the big one to always be mad at the world.

so yesterday, i was at work-- probably bullshitting like we always do up there, putting out some shelf labels on things that probably didn't even need labels. and i see her walk in.. in my head i'm like, ""oh shit, here we go again.."" but what comes out is ""hi"" in a pleasant voice (or so i try)... she says hi too at least. and then, sooner than you can even alert everybody else that the wicked witch of walnut creek is back, here she goes-- all day ALL DAY ALL DAY mouthing off on the walkie talkies about all the crap that we've done wrong for the past week and that the bathroom is disgusting. well you know what lady, clean that shit up if it bothers you, but its not in my job description to wipe people's asses.

so its official, i'm going to the philippines in december. 
for about two and a half weeks! 
we'll be leaving on the 26th so we still get to be with 
my brothers and the rest of the family for christmas 
and i'll still be here with my family and friends for my birthday! 
hopefully this birthday will be a lot more special for me 
since i'm turning 20. 
no longer a 'teen' now isn't that somethin! 
akyukyukyukyuk!!! last year's birthday sucked. 
it didn't really suck because i did have people around me 
that cared about me and that i care about, also! 
so please don't feel like this is a personal shoutout. 
but a birthday should be your day to feel like there is only YOU 
in the world and that i'm special for being ME. 
but i swear that day i felt like the most ordinary person ever. 
you know that feeling? it's more so something that feels 
disheartened inside of yourself, not so much because of others. 
but i'm not gonna be sappy about it. this is a new year and 
i'm not gonna let anything else interfere with that! 
i'm excited because i've never been there and i know i have 
a lot of family that i've never met and i'm just really ready 
to get in touch with my RoOTS! i've heard a lotta advice like, 
dress hella grimy and don't look like you got money.. 
and all this stuff about going there looking run-down 
but then again, i heard that if you're american-- you can't hide it at all. 
i know they're gonna point me out right away 
but we'll see how it goes. i just don't know 
if i can sit there for that long on a plane! 
thats a lot of hours do just sit there and 
you know how my back likes to act. 
we'll see. but i'm really happy and feel really fortunate 
that i have this opportunity to see where i came from! 
excitement! 

dang, i get outta school this week and already we gotta go back to school on august 25th! i'm working myself hard, i swear. but i really do love it. me and janice are going to monterey in a week, i think? at least before school starts and we're gonna stay out there for two days, spend the night and just relax and be US! it'll be a lotta fun. we've been working real hard so i think we owe it to ourselves. yay! and this september we're gonna do something cuz we're celebrating our 10 year anniversary as buddies. man, me and that girl have had our ups and downs and no matter how much i get sick of her nagging ass, she will always be my girl! even when we're caught up doing different stuff, we know its cuz we've got other things to handle and we gotta do what we gotta do. but we always just pick up where we left off. shes pretty much a part of the family, her ass is always here eating up our food. but i cant hate cuz she brings over food too. she's like the daughter my parents never wanted. HA! i'm kidding. but really she is like another daughter and like another sister to my brothers. she's just crazy like that but i appreciate her tho cuz she reminds me that i can't be so mean all the time. and i remind her that SHE CAN BE MEAN sometimes! 

well i got work at 1130 so i better get off and get ready to go. 
i'm gonna go catch a little bit of regis and kelly and the view 
cuz you know i go through withdrawals 
when i can't watch my daytime talk shows. 
have a blessed day and CARPE DiEM!!!! love yall."

"event","okay this weekend has been really busy although it seems like i havent done much.  all i've really done is work, school and studying! but that, in itself is draining. and all my working-schooling people know what i'm sayin! ..but even though life is so busy and all that, i really cant complain. in fact, i thank god that ive got the strength to take these two summer courses and work 30 some odd hours a week and still have time for studying and all that. actually, i do pray-- especially every sunday, that god can just GIVE ME the strength to last through the week and keep focused on what i have to do. and really, i thank god that he does that for me. sometimes i wanna give up and throw in the towel, or just do mediocre on my school work, but i look at the bigger picture and what i wanna do.. 

i'm also grateful that i went to a jc first. everyone always tells me that i'm hecka dumb, well not ALWAYS but they said i couldve really just went straight to a state or UC, but even though thats what people strive to do and thats what the 'norm' is for fresh outta high school people, i just didnt feel like it was right for ME. all my life, ived always strived to work at my own pace and do whatever i felt was comfortable for me. and what i'm doing now is comfortable for me. and i LIKE IT! i'm getting ready to be out that b*tch soon tho. haha.. i'm ready to move it along now!

alongside with figuring out my own goals.. whether i want to be a print writer, or maybe even a teacher.. i'm trying to help steven figure out his own self too. its very frustrating to have someone you love, have no idea where theyre going. and the thing about it is- he's not really putting much effort into it. hes so smart, and hes got his mind right-- but right now, hes living day to day and not really thinking about the long term aspects of us life. and as much as he hates it, i had to lecture him about where he's going and in what direction does he see himself headed.. and he really had no clue about it or where he was at this point in life. i think it really got his head working and i hope so-- beacuse as much as i love a person, and i'm sorry if this sounds wrong... but as much as i love a person- i really can't see my life fully complete and have my goals met, without my other half wanting the same for himself too. its not about having the money, or being 'successful'.. to me, its about finding your PASSiON in life and what makes you want to be a better person. for me, thats writing.. its my outlet of expression and more and more i begin to realize how much writing creates who i am and how much my fingertips to a keyboard creates magic.

i know i sound REAL corny right now.. but people actually read this sh*t and people actually check to see what else i've written. every paper i get back, my teachers/professors/instructors always tell me that i've got talent and a natural knack. and i guess i've never really noticed it- because thats just what i thought was natural for them to say, and i'm not trying to toot my own horn but TOOT TOOT, i dont give a damn-- writing is my thang and i think it always has been. i think now i'm just really falling into it and believing in myself that i can make this my career. 

steven is thinking about going to the philippines to go to school. it aint working for him out in sac. hes just too much consumed in the hood and doin the whole street thang and making loot that hes lost site of what's really important. and his family thinks he should check out the motherland cuz damn. i dont know, he just NEEDS to gain some insight! ..thats the number one thing that frustrates me about him. but two of his cousins left to go to school there and they ended up LOViN' IT. they come back to the states and nothing's the same for them anymore. they end up wanting to go back to the philippines and continue working towards their goals. he doesnt wanna go cuz he doesnt wanna lose me-- but i really cant be mad at him, if hes trying to better himself and us to find out what he wants to do. him moving away isn't a selfish act, but i find that to be selfless. cuz as much as he doesnt wanna leave me here, he might. and i have the utmost respect for him for putting me aside for once. he really takes good care of me and hes scared to leave me alone, but i REALLY cannot be mad at him for that. i love him a lot.. i dont know, okay i'm lost for words. thinking too much about it now!

so sac state is still my number one option cuz i'll still have steven's family out there to chill with and i still have like, hella choices to live (FOR FREE, MiGHT i ADD! thats the key!) .. but i'm also gonna apply to st. marys and other places that are far enough but close enough. 

this wasnt really an interesting entry, but to me it is. a lot of times while i'm writing on here i just figure out a lotta stuff for myself! thats good, cuz its not just entertainment. well i'm about to go to sleep. another shift of work tomorrow-- i hope the people that get shipped from the Sunday Ad bus aren't many. you know its always the same damn people waiting outside the door at 9:50 am on a Sunday morning?  and as our manager janet says, ""why are they wasting their got damn time standing outside the got damn door? i'm not opening this door until 10:01, people. get a life! shit!"" retail life. sucks."

"event","okay, i'm reading my ""Experiencing the World's Religions"" book but i'm talking to my friend Richard online too (Chigger, to some of you. Backstreet to most!) well anyways, we're straight up reminiscing about the past and how much fun it used to be. it puts a smile on my face just thinking about it!  and how we've just all grown up and everything and we're all doing different things. we're just talking about gerald and how we all used to be on 3 way together and how me and chantal used to be so close and we bought him power ranger stuff for his birthday in 5th grade. good times. 

you know, its sad to think about the way life doesnt end up the way you expect it. but thats just how it works. you have some good times, and you also experience some losses. but what you cant lose sight of, is all the good things that you are blessed with every day. and how lucky you are to be here on this Earth, spending time with the people you love. at the end of the day, you get a little sad when you think about how everyone has drifted or the people you've lost but its just too much weight on yourself if you think about the negativity.  i think God wants us all to be happy and think about the good things we've accomplished and the good times we've had. at the end of the day, i know i'm happy with what i've got, no matter how crappy it may seem. i know every day we're all caught up in work and school and running around taking care of business- but always make time for the people you love."

TRUE THAT! it is REALLY limited for a reason. people love to talk, especially females, and even when you think you can trust someone, they turn around and open their mouths. this isn't about me or about any of you, just feelin' what shes sayin! girls TALK TOO MUCH! it definitely is a lesson to be learned.."

"event","today was fun. well, lemme just say the whole weekend was fun. damn was i busy! we had our velasquez family reunion 2004 here at the house and DAMN, there was so much family.  people were worried about the food, and if it wa gonna be fun-- but it was a lotta fun and i must say that it was our best reunion yet!  previous years, we had it in halls or community centers and there was no unity in it.  people just sat at tables with the family they already knew and it was like damn, you left still knowing the same people and not knowing the same people.  so we figured, if we put ourselves in a more personal setting, like a HOME, then people will actually mix and mingle and talk and just have fun. and it was fun. i love my family! theyre too great. 

anyway, so we had a lotta setting up and a lot of cleaning up afterwards.. and you know i was hella tired, but i gotta do what i gotta do. and plus there was family staying here from down south so we had to be courteous and all that too. janice and steven came cuz you know- they likes my fam and all that. so today, i had school in the morning and then when i got home took a nap.

later on in the day, around 1pm.. me, my mom and my dad went to the alameda county fair! they havent gone since damn, i guess 20 years (like when they were still single). and i havent gone in like 4 years when me, mo, janice, katie and patrick went.  but we had hella fun and i had my funnel cake. yall know thats tha shit!!! we went to a free concert, WAR. theyre dope.. live bands are the best. we ended up leaving at 9pm. so we was there for a cool minute.

i just did my religion studies homework and i gotta catch up on reading for that (but i'll do that later), cuz right now i gotta do some philosophy homework.  i think we're having a quiz tomorrow on religion and ethics. sOOOOoo, i need to read read read and go over notes and all that crap.  what i do need is a damn nap but i'll just hold off on that til i really go to sleep..

and i'm hella outta touch with hella people. some might call it shady, but im just bad at answering phones and giving calls back. hey thats just me. but apologies anyways.

well take care everyone, have a good night and god bless.
i'm sorry this is boring but shit is just too hectic lately to be funny!"

"event","so i just got done with my philosophy homework. i think this week shit is really starting to pick up and for my religious studies class too. i can hang tho. its no big deal. i'm updating because certain people that really read this shit are left high and dry with nothing to keep occupied for like 5 minutes. HA. but its all good, i'll update.

work is a bitch sometimes when you dont want to go.
dont get me wrong. i like gettin' paper, you know i aint mad!
i just hate the daily grind of doing repetitious shit. 
i hate when life feels like a cycle. it shouldnt be like that.

damn. do i even have any good stories to tell?
hold on while i think about that one for a minute..

oh yea, another WORK story .. haha but this one is funny.

so some guy comes in right. and i'm at the customer service register
he brings up a couple of binders and some dividers.
obviously looking very distraught.. and with that in mind, he says
""oh my dear.. its just one of those days.. cant do anything right""
so i finish him up, he pays with credit and hes on his old little way
and in my head, i'm like poor old guy. he probably all spazzed out.
probably forgot to take his meds or something. god bless his soul.
so that was whatever, let bygones be bygones..

and he comes back and asks me where he can find the hole-punchers
so i say, ""down aisle 12. on the left.""
we got everything all out on display. but they velcroed to the shelf
theyre out for visual purposes so people can get a sense of what theyre buying.
SO TELL ME, why this man come back
WITH THE HOLE-PUNCHER RIPPED OFF OF THE SHELF
you see the pieces of velcro and tape just baaarely hanging off..
no box. no UPC. no nothing. and he was dead serious when he brought it to me.

thats when i just fuckin' lost it inside.
really though, what in your right mind leads you to believe
that you can really just take somethin' off of display 
and buy it like that shit is really packaged 
thats like going to macy*s, taking pants off a manequin
and bringin' that shit to the register for checkout! man what the fuck.

that story wasnt even that funny but it was so boring today i just have to humor myself just to get by. shit gets dummy boring when you work at a store thats right next to nordstrom rack.  it gets a little quiet...

to top it off, some middle-eastern lady came in and was talkin to me and askin me a whole bunch of questions and i did not know what the hell she was saying. i think asking me if the software she was buying made for kids. kind of like 'Paint' in Windows. but it was Art Explosion-- for greeting cards, flyers, clipart stuff. and to top it off, her husband had to come and chime in. and ask about rebates on 5 free after rebate items (of course, it gotta be free). if they can mail it from the same place. NO. from all different addresses. 'HOW ABOUT 2 DIFFERENT ADDRESSES?"" no, muthafucka. i said NO.  mind you-- these are two of the famous people that come in on rebate sunday, waiting in the line with the rest of the cheap folks to come and get all the free stuff at 950 AM in the damn morning. when you get older, is this what life consists of? what is up with them. but really though.. what the fuck was that, 21 questions? weird night. i'm glad i'm home and out of public reach cuz people be actin' a fool. and around my rag time, i'm NO JOKE.

man i'm about to cut it tho for tonight cuz my entry was not really cool. and ive got school tomorrow morning anyways. and its about time for my weekday nighttime line-up of elimidate, 5th wheel and EX-treme dating. peace out!

and NO i aint SETTLiNG DOWN OR BUYiNG A HOUSE. getcha mind right before you get it out the door! man, i'm saving money but what the fuck do i look like? suzy homemaker? be real!"

"event","man, i cant sleep. and thats such a first. i'm up, not even an ounce of tired in me and i got summer school tomorrow morning. philosophy-- it should be FUN. i'm excited. even tho the killer part about it its at 8AM. what the hell was i thinking when i registered for that. but i aint even mad, its summer and i'd rather get that out of the way early than to have it sittin' in the middle of the day.  i've already started my religious studies course online and i'm juiced about that too. i sound hella square for that, but i like school. i honestly do! except for math. thats the only thing i hate with a passion. all those numbers confuse me. i hate that shit.

 i still havent even gotten my parking permit yet. its probably like 20 bucks now. damn, arnold. doin' us community colleges HELLA dirty! i cant believe i gotta pay twenty fuckin' bucks for a parking spot, in a parking lot that wont even be full. but i guess, california has to come out of it's big ass deficit some how.  

OooHH and lemme just say, i'm associate of the month. 
all you guys probably dont give a shit about what i am for this month 
or for the next month for that matter. 
but i do a good job at work and i'm proud of it! its only part time but still. 
and i get no raise or no type of benefits and barely get my schedule crackin' 
the way i want it to-- but still. just the recognition is all good 
and the fact that i get a cool pen for a reward (woop! woop!) 
that was really sarcasm. but i'M SORRY..
for all the bullshit office max associates have to go thru with customers 
and customers with rebates, and customers who havent received their rebates, 
or customers who wake up sunday morning...
and apparently forgot to brush they teeth 
and have a million and one questions about the ad-- 
for all of that and a trillion more other reasons, i'm proud of my little pen. 
and i'm proud of my paper certificate that will probably be laminated
in our back copy center and trimmed with rusty scissors.
and i'm proud for the polaroid picture 
that will be posted up on our dirty breakroom wall. 
for all of that and more,
 i just had to represent for all my blue-collared peoples out there
with the yellow badges and khakis on!"

"event","so damn our kitchen is virtually almost done. its about time.
what was predicted as, 'ohh.. just a week and a couple days.'
turned out to be a month and shit. its all over, so i'm not mad

and tuesday i start summer school! liteweight juiced.
i'm such a school girl. i got good grades during spring so i'm juiced about that too!
joell and michelle are still together. hella cute, huh?
joell is steven's little cousin and michelle is mine. 
hella miniature us. isnt this world crazy?! hahahahaha. i'm lovin' that.
ooh and miss janice has a MAAAAAN...haha, WOW. i'm lovin that too.
hella peoples is gettin' together with other peoples.. 
summer love.. i swear, its all in the air. HA.

me and steven are cool. we up and down and shit.
i swear if i was livin' out there it wouldnt be like this but i aint..
so theres a lotta turbulence. a lotta 'fuck you, muthafucka'
haha.. but i'm trying to just chill and relax
cuz.."" i'm tired of puttin 187 in my nigga's pager"" (FREE 99 skit, kanye)
but yea, its the summer and i'm tryin to enjoy this cuz damn
its all about having fun and being out there.. 

everything else is going well. i had a talk with one of my best.
we was outta touch for a hot minute, not OUT of touch but you know
kinda off for a second.. and yesterday night we had a real good talk
we talked about everything and anything.. good conversation
hella going over all of our history and everything we went through.
i hella realized that i really did miss him and the saying is true
you dont know what you got, til its gone. 
so when was just choppin it up, it was just natural..
and he made me realize- that when things are on your mind
no matter how much you feel it, if the situation is not right
sometimes, things are better left unsaid
its better to not say shit cuz usually, you wanna know the outcome
and if you dont know it, WHY put ya ass out there like that?
which is true, but there are those times where you have to take risks
cuz you wont know until you try, you may be passin' up somethin good
but i dont know.. hard to really explain, 
but bottom line is that good friends dont come around everyday!
so just know that you are appreciated and i'm glad me and you are good!

everyone else, much love. congratulations on graduation to everyone who made it and everyone who didnt quite make it, dont quit- cuz you will! .. and.. yea, have a good summer, live it up cuz these are the best days. best weather, alla that good stuff. 

okay i'm out. take care everyone.. =) ---ALMSerelly"

"event","life-- is really ever-evolving.. just as much as you think you've done all the growing up you possibly can, that you done seen the most harshest shit, spilled your heart out over and over again, that you climbed the highest mountain and you feelin you you been thru hell and back again.. even thru alla that.. you have even MORE ahead of you to learn. learning is an undying process that wont ever quit until... never.

after high school (even though high school was such an amazing experience for me, there was also a lotta hard times finding out who your real friends are and all that), you kinda take into your own, your life. no teachers tellin' you what is due when, no attendance office keepin tabs on where yo cuttin' ass is, everything and ANYTHiNG you do lies solely on your own square shoulders. its up to you, to make sure everything is done right, that everything is accounted for, that you dot your i's and cross your t's and if THEY AREN'T, you've gotta be man enough to own up to it and take responsibility for the mistakes you've made.

i seen people come outta high school and the minute they aint got someone on their back tryin to keep them outta trouble-- they fall off.. they let go of themselves like nothing matters except for nothing.. i dont understand why people cant take that into consideration. that the measure of your life comes down to what you do with it and how good your heart is along the way. everyone has their own timing and own ways of doing shit and thats TOTALLY understandable. everyone, i mean EVERYONE has their own path. thats not even what i'm talkin about. its like- some people take the fast lane to things, some others just hit that shit in cruise control and just ride to wherever they need to be.. but one thing that those two groups of people have in common-- is that eventually--- they get to where they want to be. no matter if its 6 months from now, or 2 years from now. the point is-- they are DOiNG it and taking action and its better late than never. honestly,  that IS the bottom line.

but me.. what i'M talkin' about.. is people that let go of themselves and have no type of drive. motivation. persistence. but.. i just hope and pray that people gain some of those elements because its sad to mosey on through life without it. i do wanna give a shout to my two favorite cousins from 98th and C.. and let yall two know that you guys are in my prayers. yall are two people, that have that drive, motivation and passion for what you do and as far as figuring out life-- were were well on your way to doing that. you guys wanted to make shit better for yourselves. and no matter where yall are--- no matter how tough it gets, i hope you guys never let go of that faith and keep working that way up and OUT. cuz you two really don't deserve to be where you guys are and i know that for a fact because g, you told me the whole get down on the getdown and its just bullshit. you are too good of a person and you dont deserve to be seen as anything less than what you are. people just dont understand that if you keep pushin' and pushin' people-- one day they just might push back. its really somethin' that breaks my heart to see yall so far away but just keep your heads up and know that you got all ya friends, family, and whoever.. ready and waitin' for you guys to come home. i love yall!

anyways, this weekend was crazy.. got too crunk for words. lets just put it like that! but nonetheless, i had a blast with my girls, sac boys and my man, steven! and a big shout out to steven for taking really good care of me. i dont know what i would do without you.. when you clean up someones yak with your bare hands? now thats love."

"event","so damn, is it just me or is the semester just draggin' on and on and on.. 
its drivin' me BANANAS! but anyway, didn't do much today

i had work all day. 8 AM to 4 PM.. 
hella killed my sleep and shit but damn, they been doin it for weeks now
 so i guess i should be over it by now

why some ladies try to get over on us yesterday tho?
they walk in right, pick up a big ass printer
and try to bring it to me at customer service, talkin bout--
""oh, yea we tryna return this because um.. 
my mama bought it and umm.. yea, we dont need it..
but yea, i aint got the receipt..""

bitches, PLEASE. come on NOW! 
how are you just gonna stroll up in here
actin' like tony rich project.. 
thinkin NOBODY KNOWS iT BUT ME!!
really though, you might as well tattoo that shit
on the middle of your forehead, right across sayin ""THEIF""
because everybody knew it.. 

first of all-- 
do not glance around like ludacris
in the club (more like office max), lookin' so conscipuous
straight up actin' like the FBI is gonna run thru any minute

second of all-- 
no receipt? i get that shit all the time, i'm immune to that excuse
how are you gonna buy something THAT expensive and 
just conveniently manage to lose that sh*t?

third of all-- 
dont steal somethin' when the products are right in front of me
and are already pre-counted. there was 3. now there's 2.
i sure as hell didn't sell one, neither did my girl teresita.
(people, A BiG ASS BOX. we aint talkin' bout no pens and erasers)
so what in the hell, kanye-- you can't walk across that mu'fuckin stage!

fourth of all-- 
dont say ya mama got it and then change it to say ya daughter bought it!
always have your story right. its like they made it up on the spot
or.. it couldve been that yerple talkin'! cuz they smelt like it.

worst of all, when my manager (fighting crime or whatnot)
called our top flight security that watch birds all day..
they lied up and down, i mean- thru THEiR TEETH
swearin' that they didnt have nothin to do with the printer..
i SWEAR, people be scandalous these days!
just to get over on some CASH!.. really tho, the nerve.

but anyway, after that-- came home and went out with my mom to buy food
you know, livin' off of take-out and whatnot since our kitchen is not a kitchen
but instead, its a hacked-up, hammered-out hole in the house
with no food, no countertops and 
not even ONE cupboard to store a can of stewed tomatoes.
its lookin' real sad over here! haha.. 

yea but i dont have any homework.. just gotta mark the scantron for music
that class is an easy A.. sumarez is one funny ass cat! smokin' that sh*t!
english is a breeze.. writing is what i do, so theres no way i cant excel in there
history is just the only class i gotta study in cuz its hella memorization
i gotta go over my notes but not too much cuz the final is only on
what we're covering the last 1/3 of the semester..
but i'm tellin' you, if it was a recollection of the whole semester..
i would be SOOOO dead. hahahaha. 

my history teacher is an extra for movies. i think thats hella dope--
even tho i aint ever heard of any movie that he's been in, AT ALL
its just nice that an old fella gets to sit and reminisce about stuff
that us kids.. weren't even alive to witness.

SO.. i guess that's really it.. 
my day in a nutshell.. i didnt even have a nap
oh my goodness, thats just too crazy
its good tho cuz i'm building up my energy level

i guess i'm just in a really good, productive mood..
i feel good about myself that i'm keeping busy
if i'm not at school, i'm at work, if i'm not at work
then i'm doing something for school.. 
or spending time with my family or whatnot.. 
its just fulfilling when you know your day hasnt gone to waste

ever since chantal passed, ive been trying to get my head on
i mean, it was on-- but i tried to screw it on a little tighter.. 
and i promised myself that i would try..
that i would try to show more appreciation for my blessings
carpe diem is something that i been feelin' since all that
because really, you never know whats around the corner
and to know that and REALIZE that, 
what would i look like if i just sat around and did nothing?
sometimes you have to take chances..
even if it may result in you lookin' like a jackass
or result in things not going the way you planned
i say.. its better to know, than to spend a lifetime NOT knowing.
god always has a way for you to overcome the obstacles!
thats really, real talk!

so P*****K-- STOP saying 'if its my time to go, its my time to go.'
dont create it to be your time. let god create it to be your time.
i know you know i get mad about it, but more than anything it makes me sad
cuz i dont want anybody, especially my people,
to think so nonchalantly like that. iT'S REALLY unsettling.
and to top it off-- and what makes it SO MUCH WORSE
is that its unfortunate that chantal had to be our lesson to be learned
even something as simple as a safebelt.
i'm not lecturing anybody, or you P**-- but i just want you to know that.
REAL TALK! ms. antonio's just lookin' out for you!
theres a reason' why you're breathin'.. 
dont sell yourself short by not figuring that out!

anyway, didnt mean to get soft on yall for a minute, 
but thats just something thats really important to me

i think imma go lay down now or at least got off this comp
cuz i been online for a cool minute and i'm starting to feel like a
cyber geek. i'll write back some other day.. 

much love-- almserelly"

AND i KNOW, you guys missed my writing! you aint gotta lie! .. 

hold up watching american idol.. HAHAH i'm lame
okay i'm BACK! all i gotta say is latoya, you do yo thang, girl! .. 
hella proud! representin' the BAY! i have a feelin she's gonna
bust a TO cuz she.. could.. go... all.. the ... way! REAL TALK!

the semester is once again-- dwindling down.. (haha, which is the last time that i wrote in this shit). boy time flies.. things are going well 

i'm still with steven.. surprise surprise, and of course--
we have our issues from time to time
he be lyin' about the dumbest shit..
its like i'm sorry 2002.. 2003.. 2004..
good lord, let the madness end..

but i'm not perfect either.. gotta admit that
and i havent given up yet and i really dont plan on it
why funk with a good thing, you know? it aint easy
but nobody said it was gonna be and i didnt except it to be!

me and the girls are ALL doing our own thing.. like seriously
for a cool minute everything was split.. separated


<<REWiND.. back it up-- you know FANTASiA off the hook too! haha
so i dont know.. but i think they bout to go head to head in this! too juiced!

anyways.. haha, hella jumpin' around
so the girls are doing their own thangs.. 
for a minute, we was like-- cottage cheese and ground beef
just REALLY not mixin'. not on purpose but it just fell off that way
ever since work we've been caught up doin' that
and of course me and janice are still doin school..
and other reasons but thats for the 4 walls to be UP and quiet about.
its hella hard to balance everything when you know that 
priorities are all over the place..

at a point, just A POiNT.. we weren't even really talking
you had mondeez out there in santa cruz, doin school and PDT stuff
moey and nia workin' in union city like all the damn time
me and janice workin' and schoolin
miss kim, i dont even know where she was actually hahaha
and kazz in the air force, serving our country
learning the ways of an air traffic controller
iTS ALL REALLY BANANAS! we're really growin' up

so i just think of it as when we grow up, we kinda grow apart..
but the thing is-- just because you grow up 
doesnt MEAN you HAVE to grow apart
and that was the part that i hated about it.. 
without them i felt that a piece of ME was missing
no matter how much i denied it.. or tried to downplay it..
i know, in my heart-- that i wasnt the same..
i didnt give off that spark no more, you know?

so i thought-- it was time for a turn around..
me, janice, mo and nia all had a talk, locked up in my car
like we was on muthaf*ckin alcatraz and we couldn't get OUT..
at the duck pond.. lettin' loose, gettin shit off our CHEST
just sayin' what we had to say and finally really puttin everythang on the table
i think we all felt the same way but its just nobody took initiative.
then after that, an even more heated talk cuz of a certain someone.

it got SEGREGATED.. it got down right UGLY in a way..
but we all came to an understanding after we all calmed down..
BUT.. the point is, after all that.. 
we still managed to find a way back to each other
and that MEANS something, you know?
you just dont put your heart and soul into people that you believe in..
and then turn around and let it all fall down..
and for me, i just dont go out like that. i know i work harder than that

but recently, things have been looking up on the sunny side..
me and janice visited mondeez @ UCSC for her PCC night.. 
still the same, still dancin' her ass off.. still earthy girl.. haha
me and miss kim had a fall off BUT thanks for IMing me girl.. 
i'm glad you did and we can put all that nonsense behind us 
hopefully, we can rebuild our friendship, you know i'm still yo trooper! haha
i cant fake the funk, i been gone for too long!
kazz has been keeping in touch, doing her air force thang..
working hard, training hard and we're all so proud of her.
mo and nia, those are girls i must say.. no matter WHAT..

""NOW i KNOW THAT THiNGS GOT CRAZY..
SiLLY WAYS AND ACTiN' SHADY..
BUT BABY THATS THE REASON WHY i LOVE YOU!""
haha.. still lovin' that B 2 K, baby! .. forever our song.. 
crazy, crazy, spontaneous, fun-loving girls.. i love it!
and janice-- shes just janice. still a jackass but love her nonetheless
sorry about bappin' your shit today by the way
we wont get into details on that one SOoOOOo...hahaha

*OBViOUS SUBJECT CHANGE*
ANYWAYS..
i just wanna let yall know. that not ONE person makes mistakes
or TWO people make mistakes.. but we ALL made mistakes
i play a part in it too and i apologize. LiVE AND LEARN!
and we will continue to make mistakes for the REST OF OUR LiVES

but i was brought up to know that forgiveness is one of the main
MAiN MAiN main virtues in life and i seriously do live by that
lifes too short to get by focusin' on the little shit
CARPE DiEM! all the way.. everything is everything

and plus, i dont think i'll ever love a set of friends as much as i love my girls.
no matter how near or how far we are.. or no matter how drifted we are
theres just a place right here in my heart with yall names on it!
i dont care what anyone says, no matter how much i hide it..
thats the down right TRUTH! thats just what im feelin'

anyway, moey's birthdays coming up next week!
 the 19th and shes about to hit the big DUB! 
wow its just really bananas.. 
so we're plannin' a she-bang-bang for her birthday!

maaaaaan, just call us deathrow..
cuz we' goin from OAKLAND to SACTOWN, 
the bay area and back down! .. like old times!

its gonna be too fun.. i'm too juiced for my own good
you know i'm down for whatever and i'm just excited to get crunk
with my girls, 4 walls UP! and all our sac boys.. 
hopefully, HOPEFULLY mama chu will just cut miss janice some slack

hella rambling on and on and on about my girls but

refried beans, sweet corn, mandarin oranges 
and other yummy canned goods that we have stored in the cupboards since 1992.
no home cooking. i cant wait. i'm so excited.

PEACE UP! love... almserelly"

"event","for some reason, i was completely unaware of the fact that i start FALL 2003 on AUGUST 18TH. man, what the hell is wrong with this picture? i'm just sayin.. i get outta SPRING 2003 the end of may. and started summer school MID-JUNE. sooo, technically i've had absolutely SHIT DAYS of summer.. and the last of it is dwindling down..  call me wyclef cuz i may need somebody to call 911..  cuz this shit is CRAZY!!!

other than that, i've been chillen'.. doin the whole school thang
well, thats every once in a while.. i do go to class
but its selective. its whenever i feel like i wanna go.
i've done well on the first 2 tests but my third one was absolutely horrific.
NOW, i've got my final next thursday..
so lets hope that i tackle and shackle that bad boy!!

my girls are good.. doin' our twangy twang.. you know
bein' out there, mixin' and minglin' with the fellas
meeting new people.. our summer has been fun
its nothing outrageous cuz we really didnt go nowhere
we got our trips to sac.. and thats always good
sac never really cracked for us till now
and OohhWEE that nite in OLD SAC..
if that was just not crackin' like 
my back at a chiropractor adjustment..
boooooy, i tell ya. i dont know WHAT IS.
we been liteweight slippin' tho from them boys
cuz of all the little controversies surroundin'
but we still keep tabs and we make folks
where ever we go. so its NUTCHIN'!
but when we do go places, we make it FUN.
when we sit @ home doin' nothin, we make it FUN.
just spending time with my lovely girls
having talks.. keepin' shit open.. just relaxing
its all relative, and its all FUN.
so.. pretty much---
no matter what we do, i have fun with them..
memories are memories and thats all that matters!

i'm still with stevo.. we have our ups and our waaaay downs
but thru it all, thats my heart and we're workin on our issues.
sometimes we do get a little too stressed,
to the point where i just wanna slap his ass silly
but who doesnt get like that every once in a while
i hope it aint just me.. but whatever. 
we've been thru a lot and its been 8 months
and i cant really see myself starting ALL OVER with someone new
thats just not a part of the agenda and i dont plan on making it

my main focus is passing this class. i hope i can AT LEAST earn a C+ or something on this test because i cant take this class again. i REFUSE iT!! it accounts for 40 percent of my grade.. 

today-- went to class for a total of 2 minutes. checked in- checked out.. came home and slept.. woke up.. washed dishes cuz people in this household never heard of soap and water apparently.. so i did that. washed the utensils.. cuz apparently they dont understand that utensils need to be washed ALONG with dishes.. 

i dont know what i'm saying anymore but that is enough writing.. i'm falling off! i lost my magic touch.. i wanna go to waterworld. splash around and get blacker than i already am..  no GA tomorrow, plans changed.. nia has to watch the kids. too bad, we'll go next time tho. we still got ALL SUMMER! wait.. thats 2 weeks. minus janice's cruise to ensanada, mexico. and my trip to vegas.. so thats 1 week of summer. damn you governmental school day requirement. i'm out, TWO FiNGERS!"

"event","pretty much everyone has heard the news about chan.. i still CANT believe it.. i grew up with her, you know? and its crazy to think that someone you've known for so long and someone so close can be gone just like that. i cant even begin to feel what her family feels..  chantal was sooo special to so many people and nobody understands WHY it had to happen.. it shouldnt have happened..  the only thing i can say is that God wanted her. God wanted her, just like that.. there was a reason why the accident happened the way it did, and there was a reason for her not wearing a seatbelt..  it was her time.

i'm at a lost for words right now.. memories from when we were kids  and even up to high school just keep running thru my mind.. and sometimes i just smile at the wacky times we had. she was one of the few grade school friends that i kept and still talked to thru the years. boy oh BOY were we some fools! 
matching clothes, trading shoes in the school parking lot, 
our tails.. mine on the bottom, yours from the top
spending the night EVERY weekend,  my house! no, my house!
imaginary friends..
TP troopers, FOREVER!
'the unknown' 4th grade secret club, 
BestFriendsForever, BFF!! , 
'Nah uh, Laurena- you look just how you did last night!'  
'Duh, cuz you're right by the heater!'
aces wild was our 5th grade club..
mine and chantal's song:
(aces wild is the coolest club around
if you wanna be in it, you gotta be down!
it doesnt matter color, it doesnt matter age,
just as long as youre around, to hang with the gang
we dont do drugs, we dont do beer,
as long as theyre around, none of us are near!')
working @ old navy, dirty ass bikini rack we had to clean.  
man, the list goes on fooooor-eeeeever...

i was reading old entries in my frosh yearbook and towards the end she wrote: 
""we're blood sisters! we're practically a my buddy and me! I love ya always! much love and respect! .. More love, Chan.. (Always smile for me!!)"" which made me realize, dang.. we are blood sisters. back in the 4th grade, before we gave a shit about diseases or nasty ass infections, we meshed our blood together in the Wilson grass, and buried our band-aids.. that day we meshed ourselves for life. and we lived up to it too.. me, chan and laurena still kept everything tight.. middle school, high school-- nothin faded our friendship. yea, we started kickin it with different people and doin our own thang, but we never let each other go.. we always held on, one way or another.. 

it is a sad time for everyone.. i'm goin' thru it, EVERYONE is going through it. i'm just hella hurt by it and i still cant even register it in my mind.  but its an eye-opener.. appreciate what you do have. and remember her for what she was when she was here. and think of her as how she is now.. shes up there with God. shes in heaven. i know she'd want us to be happy for how she's impacted us in our lives. she doesnt want us to be sad.. she wants us to remember the life she had.. shes still livin' it up too, but way up there.. 

we went to the crash site today and i got the chills knowing that that's  where it all happened.. and thats how it happened.. i just wish there was something that could have stopped it.. or anything.. i'm upset at the fact that she left the way she did.. and i'm sorry, chantal..it wasnt fair to you.. you still had a lot to live, a lot to experience. and i'm hurt. i'm frustrated.  i'm mad because you're not here anymore..i dont even know what to think. you're all that i think about. we have a 13 year friendship. tomorrow's the service and thats the time where its really gonna sink into my head.. 

now that shes gone, it just makes you realize that this is it.. this is your time to shine, this is your time to do what you do with your life and make it count. just forget ALL the bullshit, let bygones be bygones and stop fussin' over the things that you dont have or could have had or used to have.. appreciate what you have NOW, at THIS MOMENT and never forget those who have made an impact on your life. buckle up. yes, its ridiculous but it only takes a few seconds.. forget the comfortability, this is your life. cherish it. take care of it. it brings heartache to know that THIS is what it takes for some people to realize that, but at least i always know that chantal is the one who made me change ways and live my life the way it should be.. its a hard way to bring everyone together, but its happening.. friends ive lost contact with thruout the years ive seen again.. old friendships are coming back.. new friendships are forming.. current ones are growing stronger.  i wont ever have to worry about her being forgotten because too many people loved her like that..  she was a sweetheart. she was beautiful. and i'm always gonna remember my blood sister. i love you, chantal and i know you're smiling down on us right now. you are everyone's angel and i know one day i'll see you again.. B F F !! and dont worry, i'm gonna always smile for you.."

"event","yump. so finally summer is here and half of my first two weeks of summer was fucked up cuz i got my wisdom teeth pulled. all four but it wasnt even that much of an issue cuz i was a G about it and gettin all sedated helped. had the vicodin which killed a lotta pain but i stopped taking it after a couple days cuz i didnt wanna rely on it to make me feel all to the player.. 

basically this is my last week of summer, so i'm doin' what i can before i start summer school. today i did my online traffic school so i can clear my fuckin speeding ticket. so i passed with flying colors and thats one less thing to worry about

passed my history7 class with a B even tho i was never there and you KNOW thats the damn truth. i was always doin what i could to not go.. i'm a bad ass but thats all gonna change this Fall. i took hella advantage of my first year but i aint really tryna play no games NO MORE!

ne-ne and miss kim are graduating now! woohOO. now all my girls are outta high.. time really flies tho but you dont really think about it till it happens.. goin out to sac this weekend to celebrate. i know it'll be fun cuz we always do what we do and live it up out there. yea it does suck we dont see big boy ronnell and them like we used to, but with pinky and the gang we do it way more live-er.. my roo-roo gets outta work at 3am which sucks but hopefully we find a function to go to before we head back to the room. and i aint mad cuz we been poor for a minute and its time to really make that paper.. hahaha. i aint greedy, sharing is caring so what the fuck ever! .. its a mutual thang- if i had a J-O-B i'd do the same. but i dont so i cant. 

hmmm.. yup. so mo's right, we have been chillen lately but i feel like its not like oooh damn theyre boring.. its just like, we grew up and stuff and i'm glad ive grown up with the people i have and i'm glad i've went thru the things i've went thru. everything happens for a reason, and i regret no regrets.. i dont ever consider anything to be not worth it, even if it is a mistake. you just gotta chonk it off and let bygones be bygones! .. i love my girls and no matter what we do, its still good shit to me. that good comfortability level is it a steady high so it aint too little for me or too much for me to just sit back, relax, grab a black and talk. but when we do do somethin, we do it live and we dO it RIGHT.. no complaints

the fams good, my girls are good.. i miss moni tho i havent talked to her or seen her in a long ass minute!! .. me and stevo are all to the straight. we're hittin 7 months i think in a couple weeks or somethin like that.. or like next week actually.. thats fuckin forever!! well for me it is cuz yall know how i used to be. but i guess when you get connected with the right person, that all changes. you feel me?! 

janice is still talkin to ohboy and mo is feelin dinky and ne got brandon. but i hope by this weekend we can ALL SEE what the fuck it is?! ya know? cuz niggas be playin.. especially justin. sometimes i just dont know about that cat. hes cool as hell but i have a few speculations about him thats got me goin 'hmmm... justin?? what is going on, smilez? tell me what you think is going on.. whats going on? whats going on? or should i ask southstar?' hmm, i DONT KNOW THO! okay i dont even know what i'm talkin bout. its late and i havent updated in a minute, so there it is and here i go.

"event","havent updated in a minute but things have been good for me. just schoolin', my girls, my fam, everythings all to the player. except for that $300 phone bill for last month. damn mama, sorry again. didnt know. swear to it. 

ANYWAYS, so this whole week we were planning to go out to sac cuz its been a minute and we wanted to KICK it, kick it..the days when we used to go to get away from the bay and kick it with some cool people. so janice wasnt sure if she wasnt gonna go or not. and its like come on man!! this is a once in a while thing and when we have fun, its good when everybody is there..  sooo, she decides to go.

well we're supposed to leave like at 730 or some shit but we end up leaving like at f*ckin 9 oclock.. we got lost and got there like 2 hours later. well not lost-lost, but we kinda went the wrong ass way but found our way again.. got to stevo and royce, wood and fe.. started drivin to the damn party..

oh the way, spotted some cute ass fools in the black car next to us. and i'm like oohwee! and everyone was gettin all juiced. so they ended up following us to the party.. we told stevo to pull over and you know, got their number and all that.

stopped at a gas station and boy oh boy, why the fuck was it just crackin at the damn gas station tOo?? never seen sac like that. never did.. and ohboy in the gray rocawear jacket that me and mo was just trippen and pullin ourselves over.. shit, my goodness. he was lookin good. lied to steven and told them that dudes in the black car AKA 'pink boys' were homies from the bay.. lol. turns out they knew 'em. got caught lyin' but hey. shit happens..

and to our fuckin dismay, the party was shut down by cops AGAIN.. i swear we're just bad luck out there. tried to find another function to go to but that one wasnt too player but then we went to vanessa's function with everyone and it was cOO! at first there were hella mijas and we were just to ourselves but once we settled in, it was a coo ass time. kicked it with our usual sac people and then met some new ones. pink boys were cOO and so was stevo's cuzo and christine. it was just a really coo ass night. twerkin fools, breakin niggas off.. they really didnt know about how we do! if you put us in an environment where its crackin, we really will start to gig..  eventually, the cops came. but it was coo cuz at the end of the night, we were all smiles cuz we had a good time. even janice, who was in trouble by mommi-yah.

so came home, and was just tyyyy-errrrred. but feelin good. gotta kick it with pink boys sOOn! and i wanna spend the night out there.. so yea, alright guys- thats it. today went to a fuckin graduation party, a 50th wedding anniversary party, a baby shower and couldnt fuck with auntie connie's bridal shower. too much for me to handle!.. i need to just chill and enjoy saturday evening.. peace yall =) god bless."

man, i got finals coming up in both of my classes on tuesday and wednesday. health- i'm not sweatin' it cuz i got that shit on lock, but goodness gracious. fuckin history.. i swear that teacher talks too damn much and thats why i barely go. but i got all my notes down and i need that shit from johnny but the bitch is seriously lagging. (not like that, because foy boy is cool peoples, but you know. i need to study off of MY notes that i let him copy).

anyways.. we dooped the other day. me, mo, janice and nia and it was hella funny cuz we done got a couple of motherfuckers just walkin' in the street. that girl from arroyo was standing there and we were literally just parked in front of her. then those fob girls.. oh and then moey finally got to see peanutty! .. still black as fuck but still cool as hell too. lol.. 

friday i spent time with my mom and my grandma. we went shopping at southshore (woo-thefuck-hoo).. but you know, thats where they wanted to go. i bought some new bed sheets and shit for my room and it looks pretty nice. didnt go out with the girls or anything and didnt go out to alameda where kazz was (sorry dude..). had to spend time with the moms cuz she barely takes off of work and i missed her. even tho i miss you too cuz you're MIA! and no, i wasnt rude to jimmy. he took it back tho cuz he thought about it and i wasnt rude. he asked me 'what are you doin tonight' and is said 'i'm just chillen at the house with my mom cuz she took off tonight for me.' and he was like 'well thanks for being RUUUUDE!' and i'm like okay nigga- since when between the time you asked me the question until i answered it, where in that point of time was i rude? and he said 'sorry, you're not rude. i take it back.' i guess he was acting like that because he was faded and i wasnt. and swerved people + sober people do not mix that well together.

saturday was fun.  i went over to janices house and helped her cook food for alex's birthday (michelle's baby). we made those sandwich wraps and wannabe filipino spaghetti. hahahah. it was all good tho. so after we were done. she got ready and i went home and got ready too. picked up moey and us 3 went to alexs birthday. goodness gracious! alex and arianna (lovelyn's baby) are so cute its not even funny! .. theyre hella cute. we kicked it there for a cool while and then moni shmoni called and she was at the marina comm. center

we cut out from there and we went to go pick up moni.. it was good seeing her! i miss that girl foreal foreal. so we went over to michelle's house again and ate and kicked it one last time over there. had some juicy juice and then yea a certain SOMEbody came cuz he was james' friend .. so we were like ewwy grossie and kept our distance. janice was being a dumbfuck and suckin' helium from the balloons. haha but that voice did match her.. 

after that the 4 of us cut out and fucking went dooping with two small ass shits. hahahahahhahahah. whatta night! it was pretty dope. i had a good time with yall. just choppin it up and spending time cuz sometimes its good to do that. wish all the girls were there but its all good. went to UC and damn-- everyone was hatin' us at the end of the night, real talk. the punjabi party at logan was pretty weird. ive never seen so many in my whole life in one spot. the only love we got was from JUJU & THE GANG! but they were cool as hell so they made up for the mijas who talked dumb shit and the fobs who were trying to kill us. so we followed juju and the gang to san leandro and chopped it up with them. damn, some of them had some nice ass eyes. rome the one i was talking to had the green-brown eyes and dre- the one mo was talking to had light ass brown eyes. but most importantly- T was hella cOo and they saved our lives (or should i say, janices car).

after that our adrenaline went low cuz of all the shit that we went thru and we were just kickin it.. after that, went home called it an early night but a good one.

me and mo are kinda workin on gettin our tats now! kinda juice.. figured out what we wanted and we're gonna get it on our forearms cuz we've never seen no females get it there.. and it looks tite there..

now i'm chillen and kinda waiting for my fucking notebook cuz johnny didnt even call me. which is fucked the fuck up. and now that i think about it, he aint even right!

BUT, i didnt know he'd be this much of a bug again. so he says 'he knows what he wants' but man-- OH THE FUCK well because hes still stupid. he didnt get any smarter. he has calmed down a lot more. but for all yall who think maybe theres a chance that me and him are gonna start talking again, nope. trust me- it aint gonna happen.

cuz he dont even get along with my girls and you GOTTA do that.. stevo gets along with them and damn, if he didnt. he wouldve been kicked to the curb. eww.. man its so fuckin true.. i just wanna cut off everything from him cuz hes just so annoying now. and when i kicked it with him the other day- i was just disgusted by how different we are now. we just grew apart.. 

i went to that girl k.d.'s cotillion on saturday and all the old arroyo homies were there. even don-rocky, my ex. who is just like.. i dont know. weird. he doesnt even talk and he's hella to himself and i dont know how i ever carried a conversation with him in the first place. he's like a life sized doll. just sits there and doesnt say shit. but whatever- i just said wassup to that nigga and that was it. the only person that i really really talked to there was big mikey. supposedly he's stopped smokin' weed now and all that and hes into the whole racer thing (which isnt any better) but oh well.

hmm.. oh yea and on friday-- the girls finally kicked it with kazz! .. damn i havent seen her in so long or kicked it with her. we went to this dude's apartment who produces beats. it was kinda cOo.. but i dont know. didnt really do much there cuz kazz was getting shy to sing! .. but she did finally when we went outside.

after that, i think we just drove around alameda.. or i dont know what we did. but you know-- just being with the girls like the old times was fun enough. i just miss spending time with them. OoOohhh.. yea and the highlight of the night for me was when we got that dirty bum to break dance for us by the taco truck. moey got scared, but it was all good.. he was just tryin to make some money. so whatever.. they ate tacos at the truck, HELLA fast.. after that, kazz took us to my house.

me, moey and janice stayed at my house and just chopped it up for hella long. for hella long! ... just about the past and everything and all the shit we been thru and just hella memories. it was a cool night. hecka calm. we realized that we're hella more calm than what we used to be. not as rambunctious. but its cool tho.

miss kim is over here and she got a medal for having the 4th fastest time for the girl's varsity at their invitational this weekend! go head, girl! .. yup, and i gave her the little advice she needed to pull thru. anyways, congratulations! ..

(fuck you bitch! you aint been nothin but a bitch from gate! you fuckin hoe.. you fuckin bitch ass! you act like a bitch cuz you know i love you) umm NO. well i started it. i called him a bitch first, but DAMN that nigga went up my  ass and around the corner with his comments.

anyway, so i woke up and my eyes were all nasty and puffed up and shit. so i ran 'em under warm ass water and it kinda did the trick. wanted to feel 'nice' today so i threw on my boots and yea. dressed up and shit but still acted the same attitude ass i am. sOoOo.. didnt end up going to class cuz i felt like throwing up. hmm so yea

followed janice to the honda dealership so she can do some shit with her car. nia, mo and miss kim met us up! .. we went to safeway so i could drop off that big ass bag of grocery bags and shit.. on the way there saw FOb jon and cussed him out and did the damn thang. cuz you know, we're mean like that sometimes.

got to safeway and to my DELiGHTFUL ASS SURPRiSE... freddie was working. oh my goodness. hes a real cutie. cool people, too!

"event","[[supposed to have been updated on sunday, but LJ be trippen on me. so here it is on monday, but supposed to have been yesterday]]

okay so its been hella long since i update this shit. since the whole t-bone breakup thing.. thanks to all the homies who felt me and shit and who told me to keep my head up.. you guys know who you are! =) 

at this point, we're still broken up. but i aint even trippen tho cuz we're still pretty much on that level. he knows he made a mistake and what person is perfect? so i'm not even trippen about it no more cuz i done lied about shit back in the day.. but, we're still homies. more than homies, if you know what i mean. just no label. and thats fine with me. hes just the type of person imma keep in my life regardless. 

yea yea, i said that about dumbass devin-- but i came to realize that he was a perpatrator and a liar and a fake.. his love for me was there but it wasnt fully there based on some breezie named mariam (who is grossie and needs to stop wearing corked heeled shoes.) and if he meant everything he said to me in the past, he'd still be in my life at this point. BUT hes not, and plus-- you just dont go runnin' around getting in janice's face talking about 'i'm gonna hit someone and the first person imma hit is janice.' UMM NO STAINS. you just dont do that, that doesnt fly in my book. but enough about him, i dont know why i'm talking about camel-hump nose anyways. oh yea, point is.. steven is a keeper. if i dont end up with him, i know i'm gonna at least be his #1 even if he does end up with someone else.which he wont. so whatever. what we have is real and i just cant even explain it. theres no way to... sOooO.. 

been schooling.. kinda getting serious about it and telling myself i need to stop making shit ass excuses to not go. its been fun. i like health cuz we talk about dirty sex and how to drink liquor and not get a DUI. not that any of that matters- but its funny to hear some of the responses from our ghetto ass class. theres this one chinese guy in our class named some weird ass shit. like xiao giwuntz jung or some weird shit like that... anyways, his american name is 'jims'.. yes yall, JIMS. why add the S? just keep it at jim, homie. there's only one of you. 

its been a sick weekend and i miss kickin it with all my girls.. it started off just as sneezes and now its like full-blown sneeze attacks and coughing.. and its just not pretty now. i dont think i'm gonna be able to go to school tomorrow. so sad. but anyways..i miss my girls.. janice and mo came and visited me on saturday and we kicked it here for a minute until a little 911 emergency came up. thanks for coming thru tho guys! .. i appreciate it. 

hi mo! hi janice! hi kazz! hi nena! hi miss kim! hi mondeez! hahahah i got my pictures back from my birthday.. ( the ones where its all of us).. mo and janice saw em. theyre funny. lol. they look crazy and janice thinks she looks like big foot compared to all of us. 
anyway.. man, we all gotta set up a day to kick it foreals cuz i know kazz is working her ass off (wassup pimpin!).. and man, we gotta go back to beacon and be like BAM-- here's my ID fool. tsk tsk tsk.. the mini-diploma didnt even work, thats hella wrong, man.. 

oh hot diggity damn. i got a new keyboard, yall. my dad was complaining how he couldnt even sign online cuz all the letters on the keys were rubbed off. lol. cuz you know- alms can get by not knowing the labels on the keys cuz its pretty much memorized. but daddy-- poor daddy.. dear ol' daddy couldn't even sign onto AOL cuz he couldnt find the M key to sign in his password. i'm sorry.. he mustve been cussing up a storm looking for that doggone M. anyway, so we got a new keyboard from circuit city.. its kinda cool and i'm getting used to it. its one of those keyboards where it conforms to the way your hands naturally lay. pretty weird. 

we also got a new TV for downstairs. pretty nice.. no more having to use my glasses to watch boy meets world and other types of shows like that shit. alma has eagle vision now. i can be all kicked back and fall asleep without my frames on. we've come a long way, i tell you.. 

OoOooWeeEE tOOooweEEE. alma also moved around her room. i dont know why i just always have this thing about rearranging my room. last time i moved it was in july with huey and miss kim. now, the only thing i moved was my bed. and now its just smack dab in the middle of my room. all diagonal and shit like nobody's business. i'm not into the feng shui shit about good omens and serenity and fighting off evil spirits.. nah nah nah. that aint me. i just needed a change and the diagonal shift seems to work for me. so yea.. thats it 

anyway, i'm delirious and i gotta go cuz i'm sick and these halls fruit breezers are the SHIT! take it easy cuz this breezie is out. love yall (well i love the ones i love and the ones i love, should know). peace in."

"event","yes, yall. we broke up. over some stupid ass bullshit. him getting caught up in lies that he shouldnt even be having to tell. you know how one lie leads to another, leads to another and basically-- you get caught up in those lies eventually cuz they all dont make sense once you put it together? well thats pretty much what happened.

man, it hella hurts right now but i hate being lied to. especially over some bullshit. okay yea he had his reasons but that is still no reason to live this fuckin lie for fuckin 3 months into the relationship. especially when you say you love the girl.

and what sucks even more is that today is our 3 month anniversary. (not that i be saying that dumb ass 'happy anniversary' shit) but just for the record, today is the 3rd month mark. this is bullshit dude and he's hella trying to beg his way back in and he said he's sorry he lied..

sometimes sorry doesnt cut it, you feel me? maybe if you didnt lie in the first place, you wouldnt have to say sorry at all. the point is he didnt lie once, he lied a couple times, which lead to more times. and soon after, he couldnt even keep track of what lies he told. so he made up new ones and then the new and old lies didnt fit well together and i just kinda caught him up. any way.. hes crying. i'm crying. its all not good."

(keenan is cool. hella nice person.. good shit for nia) but baby mama and his cuzzo ""i dont want mcdonalds. its for my SON'' well soooOoo sorry.. shit. anyway, it was all worth it tho so nena could spend time with her man. as long as shes happy, i'm happy.

ended up eating at pasta pamadoro.. nothin new but hey-- havent had it in a while. had that good peach jamba juice and the O so we were all gravity. shit-- or at least i was. i had a coo ass time. kinda ended the night early. i felt bad cuz my brother was at home cuz him and his girl are going thru it and he didnt even spend valentines with anyone. just at home, watching tv. i'm sorry i left him. 

anyways.. the next day stevo came out. HE got lost cuz his dumb ass cant take directions right. and its not even hard to do.. but anyways i FiNALLY found him after like an hour and a half. lol. valuable time we wasted but hey its ok. i got him black maddens and a stuffed rotweiler.. on the collar of the rot, i wrote 'Alma <3's Steven 11-17-02' which is yea the day we got together. its raw. he liked it..i wrote on the shoe box too, like all over it and the bottom of the soles of his shoes.. he liked em both, he thought it was hella raw and creative.  he got me a ring.. its a 14k gold hawaiian band with etched flowers.. hella pretty. its a promise ring. so yea.. i dont know about that good promise but i'mma try. and his mom made some chocolate covered strawberries for me. yay mama. i love her.. 

visited janass at marina food and stevo was hella laughing at her do her little sample thing. he thought it was cute. hahahahha. he gave janice her present toO.. haha a chocolate dick on stick. haha janice was like 'finally i get some dick!' hahhaha, it was hella funny. locked my keys in the car so i took janices ride to my house to go pick up my spare key since steven's car was parked at janices house. he met my parents and they like him.. the way he was speakin' and how he was looking them in their eye and stuff, my parents could tell he was a cool dude. we left hella quick tho cuz my keys were in the ignition

so yea, pretty much just kicked it with him the whole day, since we had to make up for friday.. it was cool. happy to see him. he left early tho like at 9pm..

man, i'm thinking about that time during lunch when kristine and moey was playfighting and mo knocked her lunch out of her hand and was calling her names. and made her cry!! its not funny but at the time i thought it was all a joke but she ended up getting hurt. hahaha and we tried to see if she was coo but she told us to leave her alone. then they were mad at each other for hella long. and us 3 had PE together and changed in the same row and kristine would just dress hella fast and leave us. hahahaha. man, that was hella funny..

i'm just chillen at the house.. not knowing what to watch on fuckin TV anymore cuz we got direcTV and i dont know how to navigate that shit yet. so i keep looking at the mutherf*ckin pamphlet just to learn how to work something as simple as a damn TV. ive been hella lazy lately dude..

school aint really crackin.. i think i only went to like 2 days of class this week.. thats hella bad.. i literally sit there at home on my ass, watching tv, all ready to go and find excuses not to go. like 'man, i wont find any parking..' man i'm gettin stupie..

eeeEhh, but i wanna get faded tomorrow! i think thats the plan.. or something of that nature. i wanna go back out to sac cuz theres this one ROCA fit that i saw that was hella cute.. its white with trueblue runnin down the sides with red trim. short sleeves and the bottom of the pants have ties on it, like, kinda bungee but not really, just regular ties and on the sleeves too (theyre shortsleeves). but what throws it the fuck off is that it has ROC on the left chest written in a HEART. now what the fuck is that?! theres also this cute ass babyphat longsleeve pullover hoody. babyphat across the chest with the cat and matching flood pants. the fit is black trimmed in tan. i love my babyphat. gotta go back and cop that..  but at night-- time for the girls.

sorry i havent been around lately guys.. just been doing my own thing at the house. chillen with the fam a whole lot. my dad's having surgery, so you know. gotta treat him extra special now so he can feel loved. =) haha..been watchin a WHOLE lotta american idol, that is my shit. and yes-- i am a grown ass woman who did buy the cd and do be taping the shows. i just dont give a FUCK! i got ronnell and steven watching that shit too. and i voted and my vote counted! my man charles made it to the top 10 so i aint even mad!!! .. anyways,  see yall tomorrow tho (my girls, that is)!

 opened my mail and got another one from 'strawberry man' radagay-radagay-yedegez. i mean, me and him had liteweight history but the things he was sayin was just wow are you serious.. pretty much we've been e-mailing back and forth cuz hes still trying to have some closure and i wanted to know why hes still stuck after all these years and what can i do to help or whatever, so heres his response to it. yea i'm puttin all the business out here but oh well geez louise. its okay. here it is

Subj: my very depth and detailed reasons and response  
Date: 1/29/2003 9:58:04 PM Pacific Standard Time 
From: - - - 
To: ALMseReLLY 
 


    if it's not important there's no point, why ask?  why tell?  but since you did ask i'll tell.  Well, there's an obvious physical attraction...your smile, your eyes, and every part of you, down to your feet...you're beautiful.  but that's not the main reason why i'm so drawn in to you.  it's the way you carry yourself, with class and intelligence.  

i mean you dont let niggas game you, and if you did i'm sure you'd catch yourself before you fall.  you're strong willed, by that, i mean, when you believe in something you dont let nobody -but you- change your mind.  you say what's on your mind no matter what people think and you stick to it.  you might deny it but i think sweet and caring, but ready to knock a muthafucka out if they aint actin right...haha.  

you have a good sense of humor, like you would giggle at things i say or how i say it, i never know what it is exactly i say to make you laugh but you do and that makes me feel good knowin that i can do that.  i remember when you would nudge my head when i would say something stupid..haha.  just like your facial expressions and gestures, i dont know if you still do this cuz it has been a while but when you would squint your eyes and crinkle your nose a little bit, aww man that's all you had to do and i'd do just about anything you'd ask...make a nigga climb a mountain if you wanted, shit..haha. 

 i could also talk to you like you was my nigga and, it was your personality and all the little things you did that got me twisted over you.  you told me not to say it, but there is just something about you, i dont know what it is.  i cant see, hear, or touch it but i know its there..almost as if something or someone wont let me let you go.  maybe its just me...i dont know

    yeah its corny but its true, you're the first thing i think of when i wake up and the last thing on my mind before i fall asleep.  not to sound crazy but i think of what it'd be like to just give you a kiss on the lips.  i think of holding your hands and putting my arms around you.  just chillen with you, doin absolutely nothin and enjoying every minute of it.  i dont know, i just felt so strongly about us being together...cuz i mean i never ever felt like this before. i never even thought it was capable for me to be so into someone like that.  i never thought i could say the words *i love you* to anyone, much less mean it, but i did say it and i did mean it.  these are the reasons why i feel the way i do about you...i could name a million more, but i think it take forever to write and forever to read.

    hopefully that answered your question in enough depth and detail.  now can i ask you a few questions as well....

    one question i had was, do you really think we'll kick it?  its hard for me to believe.  your boy might let it slide for now, but after awhile he aint.  thats just facts.  i mean kickin it with your homeboys is one thing--it's nuthin, but im sure he knows how i feel about you.  and i dont know if you missed it in my last letter, but if we do kick it..i'ma do all that i can to get you feelin me the way im feelin you.  would you still be coo with that? cuz if he knew, that you knew, i was still trying to get with you and you still kicked it..you might lose your man bullshittin wit me.  so  us kickin it, lies soley on you..just call me.

    right now, i feel like i aint got nuthin to lose..so i'ma just say it...no disrespect to your boy but, im just curious...i know he's probably a good guy and all, but are you really feelin him like that, like ""feelin"" feelin him...cuz i remember when ya'll talked, you didnt think of it as ""really talkin"" but just talkin.  i mean there's a lot of good females out there i know, and i do like them...but i dont see them that way...is it possible that it's like that with you but you're just with him....or i dont know..im sorry, i dont know what im sayin right now, im stupid..dont pay any attention to that, i just had to let that out. that just makes me look bad, im hatin--i know.  sorry

    for what its worth, even if its not much--i just think that you and i would make a really good team.  i know i'd treat you right and i'd make you happier then anyone could. but thats just me and my thoughts speakin out loud again.. 
    with everything said now, you still think we'll kick it?  seems a little far-fetched now.

    just let me know somethin--get at me  

---- - - - -- ----- - - ------ - - - - ---------- - - - - --------- - - ------ -- - ---------
man its kinda crazy and i know he's serious.. but i have steven now and even if me and him did call it quits or if we did take a break, i wouldnt just jump on someone with the quickness.. it gives me the flutters.. not cuz i like him its just the way he was saying things is like, damn hella deep..

anyways, had school today.. kicked it with janice, mo, jza, kace.. MAN! it was just like the old days (minus the candice) haha.. i know she saw all of us too and was probably jealous cuz we're all still cool with each other and shes just out of the picture. i dont hate her tho, i just dont talk to her..

went to sac and kicked it with stevo and jowell for a cool while..  after we picked up jowell from kennedy high, stevo was daring me to flash some people on the street. so you know me- i'm game for whatever.. hahahahaha. there were these high school boys sittin at the bus stop, so i just pulled down my shirt hella fast and oh boy's jaw just dropped hella quick and stayed that way even when we were already down the block. hahahaha.. it was just a dare tho. kicked it at auntie baby's house, did the damn thizzle, picked his sis up from school.. just kicked it pretty much

he was being an asshole tho cuz c-los called my phone and i didnt pick it up cuz i didnt wanna talk just then.. and he gon' get all pissed and shit like 'who was that' and he calls c-los back talking about 'yea did you call alma. this is her boyfriend' eww that got me so pissed.. whatever tho, its fixed. i just hope los dont think bad of me

so tomorrow is thursday and i'm ready for the weekend.. since thursday is my friday.. geez louise.. well, i need to clear everything up with radagay.. cuz i dont know what the fuck is going on and steven aint gonna be too happy. but oh well... have a good weekend. and congrats ms kim! .. =) spence is cool."

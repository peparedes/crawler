"event","i went to retreat this friday with AACF. the turnout was something different especially having different expectations. but it was great!
it was  better than last year's and something definitely memorable, something i will be taking with me forever... God is So awesome!

i was one of the Drivers and boy was  it tiring to go and come down. i just woke up from my... 3 hour nap? if only it snowed, that would've been awesome!

so many things had happened to me.. not one of those ""retreat trtansformations"" but something that has really opened my eyes and all...

i'm just looking forward to tomorrow, where i can jus chill, like any  other monday... NO SCHOOL FOR ALL OF US! yay!!!!"

"event","i'm liking the fact that i can be totally independent and like do things on my own. like working out, going to the market, eating and shopping..I'm cool with that.. like TOTALLY!
but what i'm feeling is like that there really isn't anyone i can Hang out with and be COMPletely be comfortable and get coffee and like have Fun conversations... like i do have Certain people on my mind, but i refrain from calling them up cuz i  think i'd be totally interfering with their lives. SERIOUSLY. i'm pretty quiet these days.. i've been  pretty tired and just wanting to chill.. ya know?
it's a little frustrating on my part because i don't have this oulet.. to Verbalize what and how i'm feeling. I may have this LOving Roommate (named Linda) but she  has a  BF and she's busy with her schedule, which stops me from calling her.. when we do call eachoother, we're in class! so basically, we play phone tag on a daily basis."

so she calls me while i'm walking ALL ALONE to AACF and demands y i didn't call her for her birthday! I DID NOT FORGET! i was gonna call her after AACF to wish her a HAPpy BIrthday bc she  has church from like 8-10. here's the weird thing is that she thanked me for FLowers... but i DID NOT SEND THEM!
they came wit my DAD's Flower orders... weird... the thing is, i was planning on doing it, but never got around to doing it... so i'm thinking (for all u committed readers)- in the past, i drove Linda and Claud from SChool and i don't remember doing it...
so maybe, i did that again.. while i was asleep, i  did it or something... SSSSOO WEIRD. but maybe my dad just ordered it for me. i told my mom that it wasn'tt me.. and maybe she ordered it for herself, and we had a good laugh.
i love my mom!!! it's too bad that i'm not going home this weekend... i'm going to AACF's Winter Retreat. but we already celebrated this past Saturday @ Black ANgus in BUrbank. tthat was nice...
i'm still debating if i shouldd stick with this (LJ) or move o XANGA, becuase everyone else is on there.. i've had XANGA since like june...!!!"

"event","so i set my alarm for 835am this morning (the 8th) and i woke up at 8am! what the heck! seriously, something is  definitely wrong with my sleeping patterns... and then i went to the EAP office to turn in all my stuff! wow! more little mistakes, but it  was all good. all a cinch! (omg, that's an OLD WORD!)

since i decided to be good this quarter.. (daniel, keep me accountable!) i went  to the library today and studiedd for a GOOD Hour.. very productive. as i was walking out, i saw my good friend calvin who i have seen for what seems like ages. while talking to him, Vince walked by. he just mentioned to me thathe saw me from afar and didn't know who i was,  but jus thought my hair was so nice becuase the angle of my head and the sun rays just made it so... picture perfect or something. funny.
while  walking back to the Crest, i ran  into a girl.. she's from a Cult. she's from the Empire Ministires. STAY AWAY from them! STAY AWAY! being all weaksaauce and STUPID! i gave her my cell # and she's been calling! DAMN!  Edwin was like MICHELLE! we told u guys! anyways, AACF's first meeting  went Well! lotsa prayer and like the speaker was very... zesty? haha . i can't think of a better word.  and i decided to go to retreat... finally.  Linda  had that one coming. Intuitive girl! =P  and stella was HAPPY to know what my decision was. CHI SOng  is the  speaker. he's an old OMc pastor! he's so awesome. can't wait to see him!

linda and i went to go work out. that's three days in a row for me! YES!
we went into the weight room.. and OMG! i saw my 2ndd Eye Candy  EVER @ UCR.. he was in the weight room lifting weights. he just looked GOOD. he was tall, asian, (hard combo) and pretty muscular.  i had eye contact with him a couple of times, but i bet he only looked cuz  i looked so gross! haha! but yeah, i have another motivation to workout now.. not just to look good, but to see him!  YAY!  hahaha
i sound so deprived of GOood looking guys.... WHERE ARE THEY???!!! i just don't understand with  UCR...

so.. here comes another weekend. Crystal is Leaving for CHina thursday nite.. so as soon as class is done, i'm jetting to LA.. and then... NO PINEAPPLE PARTY FOR ME!   =(
i'm just glad that  i don't have Friday classes!
then work at 8am on Saturday... geez.. why do i ddo this to myself?!"

"event","so today started off really nicely. Claudia and i walked from the crest, bc that's where we park to go onto campus.. and on the way over there, we saw him. we saw HIM! man! what a way to start off the new Quarter, the day. the year! woo hoo! we were all squirmy! haha! i didn't just see him once today... i saw him TWICE! the 2nd time was evern better! i was with jen and we were heading back to the crest to go to costco. he was heading back to campus and they had a little chit chat.. and i heard him talking (nice voice!) and i saw him Smiling. what a Cutie! DREAMY... we had eye contact... but yeah.. nothing else. haha

anyway, back to reality.. 
claud and i signed, printed and finished most of the EAP Applications today and went to the UV for lunch. we had Tokyo Tony's... let's just say i won't be going there for a while, which is a good thing.. but... bleh!
then went to pick up the transcripts, but only her's.. and that's when i saw HIM with Jen.
we left for Costo with Linda. Man, i was stylin', rollin' in that Truck! i felt like ALl eyes were on moi! haha! i saw some familiar faces today! and that was nice. i saw my jeemmm, Fuchi, yedda and Jeff. so pleasant. it was funny, the first thing that came outta their mouths were, ""your HaiR!"" 
the one thing that i meant to buy at costco, i totally forgot to Buy! o well, i'll buy it in Glendale. then we stopped by MO val Mall to find a shampoo for my streaks to keep it this color. and drove back.
 Brenda and MIke stopped by and i gave her her Gift! she liked! =)
MIke was HEcka sore from Snowboarding. funny! they bought some stuff from Cabazon.. i swear, everyone went to cabazon.. ok, just jim, brenda and Mike... but not together...
then i left for LA with Claud. elson and Eric ( we carpooled) around 645. the backseat is surprising very Roomy and COmfy! Dropped the guys off at their place, and then dropped CLaud off at Vero's Place in LA, near my place. man, we gave eachother 3 hugs, and while she was waiting for joy and vero to come out, she gave me her little speech. SHe said not to get my heartbroken, to go workout everyday, not fight with anyone, and get straight a's... =)
then i started crying because i'm gonna miss her sssssooo much! it's just MOre because we see eachother everyday!
she commented that we were like going out and this was our parting. i know it'll only be for like 2 months.. but still... now i'm gonna be so alone..."

BOYS~  the turn out of it all was great and conversations flowed well.. and.. DAVin.. he was just.. the loudest! haha!
evertime... he'd yelled ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!"" really loud and would scare the crap outta me becuase his voice just projects, and like it's ssssooo loud. Daniel was the first to leave and when he was leaving, once again, davin yelled HAPPY BIRTHDAY DANiel!
then, when Brent and Jen were leaving, he yelled HAPPY BIRHTHDAY JEN AND BREnt! and as they leaving, the next table over yelled happy birthday to them too

so last nite, i was invited by my friends to his friend's friend's party. so that would turn out to be a Friend's friend's friend's party. lovely extension of an invitation... it was in South pas. NICE house... cute guys (like 2!)good food and some ok drinks (CHEAP wine, cheap hard liquor, and... pricey Beer).
didn't get drunk or anything, but had fun dancing with some friends. then there was the countdown, and i gave some lovin' to my CLaudia and couple hugs! i swear, i'll never forget that nite because i never saw david dance, and it was fun dancing with him, ALL CRazy! we had our little Disco Routine.. then moved on some WEird thing. i couldn't stop laughing!!! lotsa fun. what a nite of fun!
before all this, i had work.. and my dad got a new Truck. it's a toyota prerunner tacoma (2003) in a silver. we shook on it that we'd switch off. so i'll be rolling in a truck! YEAH BABY! 
and.. i had this urgency to get my hair HIghlighted purple... they didn't have purple, so i went with a red called RED Secret. i like!   it has a Kelly Rowland look! so i'm stylin'!  =P

since it's nEw years, my family stick with the traditions and go to our elders and bow. with that, comes the money!
i think i earned like a little over $100. but none of that will come to me... straight to them BILLs.. 
anyways, i'll be heading out in the truck with Claudia tomorrow!
she'll be leaving on SUnday MOrning for DC. my GAWD! i'm losing her to DC!!!!
    so, another year has come and i'm so excited for this new year. i can't really say i'm ready for what may come cross my path or come my way, but i'm gonna stay open minded as possible, as well as being well grounded with the Friendships that i have, and Cherish!  i'm hoping for  more new, Good and lasting friendships as well as love... not really romantic, although that would be nice, but other kinds of love. maybe i'll find a passion for doing something beneficial to this world. Who Knows!
what a blessing it is to have the things i have now. God has blessed me immensely in 2002!"

i saw like 5 different people in which i hung out with 3 today, for a good chunk of time...
so i had Lunch with Esther in WEstwood @ CPK. it was meant for us to have lunch, because, knowing westwood, you NEVER Find PARKING. NEVER! but there beyond yonder was a parking spot saved for us. then, we get to get seated. 2 seconds later, like 20 people walk in.. we beat the Lunch Rush too. HOw great is that?
afterwards, i dropped her off at work (her last day there because she too will be departing for DC like my dear Claudia!) and then waited for Claudia to arrive! she remade these Tshirts that jim gave me. they are sssoo awesome! and as Claudia would say,"" they're HOT!"" and along with Claudia's presence in my COld, ice box of a house, Joy had accompanied her! they stayed for like half an hour. then another half hour later, Kevin (not the Dreamy one from School that i drool over- haha) came by and picked me up to go eye shopping. he had to make sure i didn't buy anything while he went looking for stuff. so some reason, i was ssssooo drained! we went to Beverly Center, and to the Grove... we both didn't buy anything (worked out well). then we cruised randomly... and then i got All weird and starting like spazzing out and singing random songs... and he opened the windows and locked them open, and i just kept on going crazy. Strange energy comes along when ur Hecka tired. he dropped me off around 6:30ish. then, due to prior engagements, i had dinner with Crystal on Larchmont  @ le Petit Greek. we ate til we were stuffed! we both had HUGE FETA salads, in which i had Chicken in mine.. and GOod Appetizers. she could've ordered wine, now that she's 21 and all.. but she didn't. Darn. i drove and showed my new ride to her.. afterwards, we chilled at my place for while, and then she left.

"event","on the eve of CHristmas, i realized how sad our world has become.. HOmelessness has increased 19% throughout the U.S. it's so sad, especially because of the weather getting colder, and as well as the HOlidays approach. i just didn't really see it as much until i watched the news and realized how thankful i should really be. being a college student, and having a job.. i am very thankful.

i think i literally read my book ALL DAY, which was nice. i'm so into it! later that evening i went to claud's to deal with bills, and although we did do that, the majority of my stay consisted of her re-making my tshirts into a halter top and something else. She also gave me a little somethin' somethin', along with one of the best and interesting cards written. i was so touched. i love you Claud.
afterwards, i went to my cousins' place to drop off gifts for them. Stayed there a while too, catching up with the oldest, who is 2 years younger than i am, and then left around Midnite.

On Christmas morning, i woke up around 1030am, and realizing that it was time to open and give presents, i went ahead and woke my tired brother up and gave our parents' gifts together. =) then my brother gave me mine. CUte.
i went to OMC for Christmas Service with Grace, and we were fashionably late (not a good thing on this day, but i'm trying to make it seem nice). The message was about having and wanting joy in our lives. Why wouldn't be want joy in our lives? STupid people who always think that being unhappy would add an edge to their lives. Take a GOOD Look around and see all the good things that you have in your life.
after service was over, many people from our past were there as well. it was nice, yet awkward, realizing that many have indeed changed, either in appearance or personality. i was indifferent of the people there mostly. i went to Grace's for a Christmas Lunch and just chilled until around 3ish. we felt like we were there FOREVER! we went to the Grove to check out a movie. this was the first time that i went to see a movie on Christmas day. we had 3 choices: MAId iN Manhattan, Two WEeks notice, and my Big Fat Greek Wedding. ALL 3 were sold out, but we were not surprised. Moving Westward, we went to COnnection (haven't been there for AGES!) and watched 2 weeks Notice. the movie was really cute and gave me hope love will find its way to me. (HOPELESS, i am, indeed)
dropped her off, and came home. That was the first movie i saw in like 2 months!

i was hungry, but i didn't eat, really. which means, i didn't have a Christmas DInner... or any dinner! o well, i'm not bitter. we were all home that nite and we all just sat around doing random things. I of course hid in my room and read the rest of the nite, and finally finished the book, and closed it with teary eyes. My my, what a good book.
and that was how my Christmas eve and CHristmas day was spent.
and tonight, i get to work from 6pm- 12 midnite."

i went MORE SHOPPING and i'm guilty of buying some stuff for myself! BAD MICHELLE!
o well, i needed a mini- break from it all.. but of course, i bought these jeans for me from the GAP! 
went to go and work out at the Hollywood Y.. i forgot a lot of things.. like my sports bra (that's important), and my shampoo and COnditioner! (argh) i ran anyway with what i had and showered without the Shampooing. (don't worry, i washed my hair later)
all day i awaited my Hot date with grace.. we went to Larchmont and ate at Prado Restuarant. Good stuff. my second time, and her first. we talked for hours over dinner of all the things that has happened to us over the last 4 months... starting with all my drama.. then her's! Her's was about Madrid and how horrid it was for her because the program just sucked! Poor girl! she suffered a lot. She went with no expectations and to be shot down even with that... must've been horrible...!!!
she was telling me that she's not used to people speaking in English and when she's spoken to, she's caught off guard because it isn't spanish. HIlarious. she told me that she was so close to having a COMPLETELY SPANish conversation with me. She got me gifts from EUrope. Very cute and beautiful things!
=) she got my Lavender tinted pearl earrings, a pink pouch, and like Lip blam.
after dinner, knowing that she is indeed my Boba Buddy, we went to relaxtation in Westwood for boba. the drinks weren't as good that nite, but conversation was Great as usual. i dropped her off around 12ish. i came home and read my book. it's called The Absence of the Sun, by Helie Lee. Great AUthor. this is the continuation from her First book, Still life with Rice.
anyways, i have to run more errands today, and complete my shopping... i MUST! 
i must find that passport Application for EAP..."

"event","but it's funny because it was so chill today. Customers just wanted to do their own thang, which iS FINE with me and everyone else at work! i was supposed to go see Lord of the RIngs II with some co-workers.. but didn't work out. I haven't even seen the first one! so i'd probably be lost anyway. that last movie that i watched was... THE RING! damn! that's a long TIME ago.. and that was with my co-workers as well~
hmm...

i had Dinner with my mom tonight. we had sushi! it was funny bc we were talking about how my brother is so not sophisticated.. haha! and like she thinks the girl(s) that might be his Girlfriends won't be all that.. and that we won't like them very much. I never do... =P     i'm just being the Mean, Older sister.. ya know, i gotta keep that kinda front. We ate a LOt! this is twice in once week that i had sushi! WOW!

Grace is back! yay! i might hang out with her like tomorrow nite.. or monday nite. but monday nite, i might go clubbing with my younger Cousin from Glendale to Club Rewind...? never heard of it.. never been.. but i'm really not in a clubbing mood.. so i just might like cancel.. in which i'd feel terrible about!
i can't believe CHristmas is RITE AROUND THE CORNER! i'm still not done...
hm, i think i'll go to Amoeba Music and buy a couple CD's.. i never buy CD's... FOR MYSELF! i have a gift certificate that almost a year old! i better hurry up and use it!

i went to like 2 small little gatherings THurs nite! that was fun! the 1st one was one of my co-worker's CHristmas party. i didn't stay too long. I had a Hard Limonada... pretty good. the funniest things we toasted to! haha~
then to my Friend's @ucla.. and toasted to... almost being 21... and.. Friendships.. and.. LOW tolerance. haha. then just crashed there. Fun stuff!
anyway, my winter break is cool... NOthing Crazy, but just fun things here and there. i don't have the energy to do CRAZY THINGS.. but Fun things!"

"event","so i went to tyler mall with Brenda on THurs.. of finals week to get a price adjustment for this jacket i bought for Mike (brenda's man). i went in, and the manager get's all snappy with me and says u can't. me, not knowing the policies, got snappy rite back at her and said, are u sure? and then was like.. i swear we could have.. then... i was, forget it, i'm just gonna return it then. she was ICY MEAN. ""Damn Bitch"" was the phrase that went through my head... (excuse my Lingo)  she pushed my buttons... it's funny because Daniel told me that i only cuss when i need to Emphasize something. so there's my emphasis on that mean lady...
so like on Saturday, when i went in to work, one my my managers, the one that i LOVE approached me, and we had a little chat. he said that the Store manager called his that day and went off at him about me and how rude i was and how he should write me up or FIre me. He was ssssoo surprised that i would even do such a thing!  (I GUEss i'm known to be an angel or osmething) He said No to her about Writing me Up, or Firing me.
 so that's that. I kinda freaked... and i went in there the other day when i was in RSide.. (monday) to get stuff for some other people... the manager walked in the store, and i walked out. hahaha! if anything, i'm just NOT Gonna go there... i was thinking about going over there and speaking with her to apologize, but then she might think i'm just trying to suck up or something.. so i'd rather not. SHE LIKE HATESS MEE!!! So much for my idea of transferring to th GAP at Tyler...!!!

monday nite, claudia and I had a Girls' NIte in, did some girl stuff... We had a Party for MEAN PEOPLE and TOasted to Low Tolerance... (and i'll leave that at that!)

Tuesday, we wanted to get out of the city so i drove to Temecula with Claud. Because it rained, the View was just Spectacular! Speed LImit was 70.. so i raced my ass over there... we shopped and the mall there was pretty nice.
For the first time, i tried on a pair of Jeans from A&F ( I NEVER TRIED A PAIR ON) and also a pair from AE (NEVER TRIED THOSE EITHER) I LOVED THEM! but... i'm gonna pass for now.. i can ask my daddy to buy one of those for me.. (daddy's GIrl) the area where the mall is is HUge! and for dinner, we ate at this sushi place that was pretty good! i think it's called LOVE BOAT or something. so that's how our Second Date of the week went. i can't believe CLaudia will be leaving California for DC in like 2 weeks! i'm gonna miss her so much. MY life Revolves around her's and Vice Versa...
  maybe it's time for me to Expore new things.. haha!
so for now, that's it..."

    worked as a cashier, and time just flew by. saw my Friends from work.. got invited to a CHristmas Party and... found out that he's Also leaving! =(  what a shocker!
i realized that there are such WONDerful People in this world. One of my Co-workers donated like ALL His hair to a foundation for Chemo patients to make wigs. His hair was like... WEll past his Chest. He looks good with his hair ALL short! haha!

anyways, i'm glad this quarter is over.. FInished things... closed things, like books and notebooks! (YAY)... and awaiting the new year, fresh start and... just good stuff. i hung out with ESther Tonight and we went to Mr. Coffee in K-town. it was ssssooo funny because i saw EVERYONE there! people from OMC... wilton people like MOon and JOhn and... some other UCR people.. WEIRD! i was like ""HEY"" ""HEY!"" hahaha that was WEIRD!

 esther and i couldn't find parking so we parked like 2 blocks away and jsut walked. We  didn't even realize that it was RAIning eventhough we were sitting at the most Outside part of the cafe and all. so like we walked in the rain and stuff.. but it wasn't bad because we left when it paused. we talked for like 3 hours.. and Got bAD SERVICE! =P we were hoping our friend Susie would be working, and we called her and found out she quit or something.. i wasn't sure what she was saying on the phone.. u know where u're just like ""oreally?"" bc u just can'treally understand.. and can't hear... AFTER U ASKED her like ""huh?!"" ""WHAT?"" TOO MANY Times! so.. yeah, just played it off.
i have work @ 12.. so once again, my search for a 9am Service in LA... it's always the same.. i try so hard to find a place, and i don't quite find soemthing i like.

i'm disapointed in myself for thinking the way i did and for having the expectations that i did. I always do this crap to myself. I kept telling myself not to, but you really just can't help it. maybe u cann... i sure as hell can't.
i can't stop thinking about it though.. just repeats in my head.. i can't really conceentrate either.. but i'm sure winter break, i can clear my head and relax. Work some more or something.. and think about that stuff.

i had two Loverly FInals... i just hoped i passed them both. that's all i'm  asking for rite now. now i'm staring at this spanish stuff... i feel like i don't need to study for spanish, cuz, it's SPANISH! i think i wil just a little, just in case...
 Chi called me today from NY. that was nice to hear. He got my letter after nearly  a month after i sent that thing to him. He's working on a screenplay rite now about science fiction Chicks. haha! wonder how that's gonna turn out. He said he'd let me read it when he gets back for Christmas break. 
I am so looking forward to the  break. I think i really need it.. to see my friends that i miss dearly from the other side of the country ( and the world > grace) 
i just wanna get outtta RIverside. DAMN.
2 more to go.. 2 mORe..

Claudia linda and I went for a walk up Canyon Crest, then turned to Central and walked to Jenn, Trisha and Judy's. Brent was over there. it was nice to see them.
another nice thing that someone told me today was that he thought i looked Good. weird, but sweet of him to say so. i think i needed that kinda boost. 
everything is just becoming a drag...can't wait for Christmas."

i started work at 8am, which was cool.. and i just remember saying how much i LOVe work! haha! not for the money, but for the people who are there! SEriously! I'm SO GLAD!  it was quite an interesting day. One of my Co- workers like asked this Hypathtical question of: ""if i were to ask you out, like on a date, would go out with me?""
I was kinda caught off guard, definitely NOT expecting a question like that.. so i just smiled and he thought i was laughing at me. I was actually just very VERY Flattered cuz this stuff never ever happens to me, i swear... so like.. it was weird. I didn't really answer.. and later he like apologized for asking  a question, cuz like it did make me feel a little weird around him..  *SHRUG*

i told me mom and she was like ""awww, how cute"" hahaha! she's more like a friend than a mom at this point. Also, my mom told me why she wasn't very supportive of my decision to go to ITALy, or to study abroad for that matter.. and that was because she was really gonna miss me a lOT! she told me that she finds so much comfort in me just coming Home every weekend, and for that relief/ comfort to be taken away from her for like 3 months would just be overwhelming for her. ( i know i'd be totally HOMESICK, but i'm hoping to have LOTSA FUN TOO!)

my dad's friends all came over for my dad's Birthday party. His Birthday is today the 8th, but since more people are free on Saturday evenings, we decided to have it then. I ate a lOT of food and i swear, all thee weight i lost this week, came RITE BACK! ARGH! Claud and I are gonna work out this week anyway, so all to the good!
i saw all their daughters and how much they've grown.. they're all so beautiful!!! =)    and like the 3 other ones and i talked for like hours about Random things. They're HILARIOUS!~ i had to cut the evening short, becuase i really wanted to see my ESther @ UCLA!!! we went out to get boba some place near her apt. One of her ROommies is a LAKERGIRL! haha! COOL STUFF!~
anyway, esther came by with her old Roommie today to the store and i gave Them discounts and all for FRIENDS AND FAMILY.. it ends tomorrow...
 so yeah...
that was my day.. i have work at 9am.. which means i won't be going to church, in which i FEEL terrible about... but i have to start early and end early so i can get back to Rside Early, cuz i have 2 finals on mONday to study for! YIKES!

 i think i really feel asleep around 3ish, woke up a little before 7 to pee, slept for another 15 minutes and HAD to get up. it rained while i was at work, and this one time, while i was on the 2nd floor about to go on my break, i looked outside.. the sun was kinda out, and it was just POURINNGGG! i mean really! it was sssssooo beautiful! i wished at that moment that i could go out there and get all wet and play in the rain, but i had to work and stuff, so i couldn't get all blehed, y aknow? i talked with one of my co-workers. he's.. interesting. haha. that's the thing about working there. there are so many different kinds of people and i SOO enjoying  surrounding myself with people that i'mm not used to... helps me to keep an open mind and all.
got off at 5ish.. my mother picked me up cuz parking is CRAZY at the GRove... and then she took me to IN'nOUT!!! yay!!!
then we went to the spa.. and i relaxed.. i really needed that! came home, got a message about my RICH Uncle from Georgia.. met up with him, my aunt and his 3 kids, only 1 was awake. the kids are 10,7, and 2. ALl three of them are ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!~ the youngest is a Girl, so we all know that she's gonna be daddy's little princess!!! so ADORABLE!

i did all the cooking for my family (the four of us) but i enjoyed it a LOT. i wasn't stressing or anything like that. when we sat down for dinner, we all went around, said a prayer.. and it was sweet because we were getting choked up... then we ate.. and then we went around saying what we were all thankful for.. like how our family is FUnctional, and how we always have enough to get by, and when we need eachother, we're there! then the tears came again, only becuase we were just so happy!  =)  I felt like just a TV SHOw family, but it was COmpletely genuine!

     it was a great dinner! i liked it that it was just the 4 us of. and my MOTher was just ENjoying herself A LOT.. INDUlging in the food i made...  intersting, cuz i thought it was just 'aight'...  haha  but she LOVED IT! good for her! =P
 since i cooked, and my mom and i went shopping for the food my dad and brother did the cleaning (we were trying to justify in who did the cleaning up part).

afterwards, claudia, linda and i were supposed to CHill, but linda couldn't make it.. it's cuz she lives far from me and CLaud... all good. we were just driving around.. seeing where we could sit and chat.
we drove out to westwood and went into Jerry's. it was cool. she got chamomile tea (her usual) and a lemonade for me (SO plain i am!).
we had Girl talk as usual. FUN STUFF! LOTS TO laugh about.. =) and things that were on our minds.. more and more, my life is getting... what's the word... it's... hmm..
yeah... anyway...
     but it was nice to just get outta the house and chill. we were both really tired though. FOOD COMA.
so.. i'll hopefully be working tomorrow's BLACK FRIDAY (in the Retail Term) for like 4 hours.. and get some extra cash for Christmas.

Quiz, then, rite after, a MIdterm that i was studying for with Jim until 530am. Indeed, we just goofed and talked with CLaudia, the most Funnest person to talk to! she's Great... i swear, SHe's my LIFE rite now... that's sounds  really pathetic... but, i really have NO LIFE!

"event","it was a long week... had its perks.
This pat SUnday, we all went to KNotts for knotts scary farm.. haha...is there something else they call it? i don't know. it  was kinda scary, but it was more fun to see people like claudia and Diana Scream their heads off. Yes, i had like 2 ofo those moments, only bc David scared me first. it was also great t see people i  don't normally see, like Pavo (David), Diana, andd Brent. Too bad  LIL CHAM PING (CHris Lui) couldn't make it. 
  I w as just SSSSSSSOOO TIRED though. my car was fixed by my daddy, so i was really happy about  that. I had my usual set of work ahead of me... and i  think i did really well on my PHil. quiz... and  i had a midterm today as well in pysc 12.. so tired. I w as falling asleep while ""JEEM"" and  i were studying together. We both agreed that  we might've Stressed over it a little  TOO MUCH.  haha. we'll see.
ii was driving home and i  was asleep at  the wheel...

so this sunday, i  get to work from 12pm to 9pm... Great, another LATe drive back to  Riverside. All i'm focusing rite now is to  just catch u p on my sleep. I've  been deprived ALL WEEK, since Sunday, when i had like 4 hours, due to the  fact that  i have 9am classes on mondays and w e got  back like 330am from  Knotts...
every nite, i think ii averaged like 5 at most... YIKES.
i applied for this tutoring job on campus... great pay! and it'll be g reat for my future career a s a teacher! i   hope i get it or something. i just need a little extra cash, an  i refuse to work the streets.
i'm just glad this week is over... Tears and all were all worth it...

i'm really excited about school and my Spunk and enthusiasm has not gone away *GOOD THING*
My car started overheating yesterday while i was  on the freeway, coming back from Elson, charles and James'... and thankfully, Claud and Elson were in the car to just be there... we were singing out hearts out too.. my car probably just wanted to get us to shut up...so when we got off El Cerrito, we pulled off to the dirt road and just chilled until my car cooled, but it wouldn't. so we decided to just let it go down the hill on Neutral.
IT WAS SO FUNNY!!!
Elson and Claudia were pushing, while my car was still turned off. and claudia was puushing from the back seat.. the car started to pick up speed and like i  guess the back tire got Claudia's Slipper.. All i remember her saying was ""MY SLIPPER, MY SLIPPER!"" so at like 10MPH she jumped outta the car, leaving the back door open.. and in this process, cars were coming the other way
my thought was,"" CAR CAR! back DOOR IS OPEN!""
i leaned out  my window and closed the back door! then started to slow down and pulled over once again and waitied for claudia to catch up to us.
HILARIOUS!~
so, paul came by today to check it out, and my Hose from the radiator is torn up! so i have to get that change.. GREAAATTT...

another thing i realized... i actually was really pissed.. but more pissed at myself...
but i realized that i need to be careful with who i tell what..seriously... TRUSTing People these days is hard.. u think they're trustable... o HELL NO! so, everyone, becareful how u say things and to whom u say them to... cuz it'll bite u in the ASS! so, becareful, cuz people talk..."

i've been on  the  verge of getting pretty sick, with lack of sleep and all, so after i came back home to the apt with  Claudia and Linda, we ate lunch, and i fell asleep...
i  took a long ass Nap.. when i woke up, i went downstairs to see what the girls were doing.. and they said to eat what they made (i'm being such a moocher) and like while i was getting stuff to eat, i asked them how class was.. and they gave me this blank look...and Claudia said,"" Michelle, u asked us this when u p icked us up.""

i'm thinking, i didn't get up until now... I told them,""i didn't pick u guys up! i jsut woke up!""
they're like ""NO""
ii honestly couldn't remember that i piicked them up!!!!!!
isn't that ssssssoo weird. they were confirming that my car is now is the garage. and as soon as we got here, i went straiight back upstairs to go back to sleep or ssomething.. i stiill they're playing with me... but it just dooesn't make sense.
maybe  it's me just getting really sick, or i need to take some ProzAc!

it's just a little scary bc i could've totally  been sleepwalking and gotten into a car acciident wiith them in  the car, or... just hurting  someone else. 
WHY CAN'T I JUST REMEMBER?!~ OMG!

we're watching it.. and i just have to share with you how the scene goes..

Scene is set at a cafe (so typical)
the two lovers who deny their love for eachother meet... and sit across from eachother...
and the girl says,""can i sit next to you, just once, please?""
The guy doesn't say anythiung, but answers with his eyes...
so she stands up and moves next to him. They stare into eachother's eyes and then, the girl starts tearing.. and as her eyes fill up with tears, she asked him iif she can touch his face,j ust once...
once again, he answers with his eyes... With both hands, she places her hands around his handsome face, and stares into his eyes... she lets go... and says, "" thank you for allowing me to sit next to u just this once, and for letting me touch your face. I'll never forget this...""
she then runs out...

WHO DOES THAT?!  
*Sigh*
i'm a hopeless romantic.. i like these things... but this one is a little strange to me... when she ran out, he should've ran after her! DUH!

I'm in the hospital. :( I have mono. I really need to lay off the <s>hookers</s>groupies. I like, almost passed out at the concert yesterday. Mono and dehydration.

=\

Someone posted this somewhere about it:
<b>ok well as you know i was at the used concert last night. the three opening bands were all really good. but when they started setting up for the used, they took longer than normal. fianlly quinn came out. then the rest of the guys did. bert looked like he was in pain. he sat on the edge of the stage and didnt say anything. the waited like five minutes then finally started. he still looked really bad. they sang on my own, and im guessing because thats a slower song. everytime he tried to stand up he would fall back down. it wasnt like a drunken fall, he just fell. after it was over he kneeled down and said ""im sorry you guys. im so sick. i cant do this."" and jsut dropped the mic and walked off stage. the rest of the band looked really confused. they knew he was sick, but im guessing they didnt know he was going to do that. so they all walked off. then the guy from vendetta red came on and said were really sorry. berts been sick all day. he is being rished to the hospital right now. all these people were yelling bull shit. that pissed me off because you could tell he was really in pain and its not like he could decide if he was going to be sick or not. so yea, hes in the hospital now. the dj i talked to after the show said he was on an IV all day trying to get better for this show. i felt so sorry for him</b>

or... something betterish.
<b>Yeah well heres how it goes. I was in the bathroom, bert walks in and he doesnt seem good he says whats up and goes in the stall. I go back in like 30mins later and hes still in there, needless to say i sensed something wasnt right. After Vendetta Red (who sucked so bad) the used were supposed to come on. Well they took a very long time, so again i felt something wasnt right. Bert finally walks on, looks half dead and says hi, then he sits at the edge of the stage and looks sad as fuck, i then knew what i feared, he was real sick, they started to play on my own and bert tried to sing then he stopped and had to try again. Then he says in a sad/mad voice "" i am very sick and i'm fucking done"" then he throws down the microphone and walks off stage. he was so sad he couldnt played he was about crying. Then the amazing john reese comes on stage (yes he was there and i got to meet him and he is the koolest guy alive) and says bert is very sick and we have to take him to the hospital. Everyone except me and my friends start booing, i was so pissed that people were booing, he was obviously sickj as fuck, john got real pissed and so did the rest of the band. i honestly almost got into a fight b/c of this stupid fuck bad mouthing the used bad, i told him to shut is fucking mouth, true fans wouldnt get mad. I wasnt mad at all i completley understood. And anywasys it was a fucking FREE show and everyone got FREE shit so how the fuck could you complain!! i am still pissed, i caught john and sent bert my condolances(sp?) keep him in your prayers i mean he is sick, i've never seen someone so ill. Needless to say they couldnt play and its unfortunate but would you want bert to play and get even sicker? i mean come on! Anyways, letter kills the 1st band was pretty good, Story of the year was amazing! and vendetta red did a bad job lip singing. But i had a good time. PRAY FOR BERT NOW!!</b>

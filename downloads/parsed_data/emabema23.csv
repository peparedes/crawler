Your purpose in life is to find truth and meaning

You are very spiritual, and you are interested in the mysteries of life.
You are quite analytical and a great thinker. You have many theories and insights.
A life of solitude is perfect for you. You need time to think and do things your way.

In love, you are quite charming. You attract many with your confidence and wit.

While you enjoy being alone, sometimes you take it to an extreme.
You can become too isolated, shutting out loved ones and friends.
Express yourself a little bit more, and you'll be surprised where it takes you!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatisyourlifepathnumberquiz/"">What Is Your Life Path Number?</a></div>"

"event","Well, Georgia and South Carolina were actually really amazing....I'm not much of one for anything Southern, but sometimes you just have to deal with it when your brother is in the south.

We flew into Atlanta on Christmas day, drove to Athens to see my brother and meet his girlfriend and then pretty much went right to bed....then the excitement began the next day as we got to meet Nathaniel's girlfriend's (he'll be marrying her eventually) family and they cooked us a traditional southern Christmas dinner...her mother is probably the most intimidating woman I've ever met and she's SUPER controlling of her only daughter, so I guess good luck goes out to my brother....her whole family was really nice though so we all just looked past the fact that we knew her mother probably wanted nothing to do with us...

Then the real fun of my trip began...we went to Savannah, Georgia.  I've decided I should've been a history major.  Savannah was just full of history and I loved every second of it.  We spent two days walking around/driving around/riding in a trolley car/sitting by the water and watching GIANT ships come in from the ocean in Savannah.  My parents are thinking about moving there and if I had to pick any place in the south for them to live, it'd be there.  It's full of history and right on the water which is important..and even though they'd probably never make friends down there because they're 'from the north', it's fine, they don't have friends up here anyway ;).  I did a lot of thinking about life when I was there and came to many new conclusions about myself and people because it was really just a peaceful place for me.  I ALSO got to see places where parts of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and Forrest Gump and The Legend of Bagger Vance and a few other movies were filmed...and we all know how big of a movie freak I am, so that was fun.  And P.S., Forrest Gump's bus stop bench, wasn't really real, they knocked down a little wall and took out shrubbery in one of the 21 'squares' or parkish things in Savannah and made it look like a bus stop.  I learned a lot of other things about those movies there, but I won't bore you with even more details.  

We then headed to Hilton Head, South Carolina.  It was about a 45 minute drive.  We spent time with my Dad's family in the seasonal home they own there.  The only part I really loved about HH is that they're family we've never really spent time with because my dad's mom was CRAZY so we stayed away from his side of the family....she died awhile ago, but we just never made attempts after that to spend time with his family.  Hilton Head is basically just one GIANT resort town.  It's just golf course after golf course (one of which my aunt and uncle live on) and tourists everywhere, no matter what time of year.  It was fun to be on the ocean and spend time with the family, but I would've rather stayed in Savnnah a few days longer.

All in all, it was a great trip and I even bonded a little with my brother (which we all know doesn't happen much anymore).  I learned a lot about myself during this trip and kind of have a new outlook on so many things.  Who knew travelling to the south could do that to a person....and don't worry, my new life lessons have nothing to do with following Southern traditions or politics or anything like that because that would be frightening...I just happened to learn something about life whilst in the south...

Also, I chopped my hair off (I swear to god I'm not trying to copy you Katie) yesterday and put highlights in again...and now, for me at least, I'm blond.  Of course the rest of you probably won't think so, but putting blonde and light brown highlights in REALLY lightens as dark of hair as I have....

"event","I just need to reiterate...PAUL MCCARTNEY WAS AMAZING!!  I was *this close* to crying when Hey Jude, Yesterday, and Let it Be were played....our seats were kind of...behind the stage....but not really......they were just off to the side and we could only see the back of his head except for when he would change guitars (which was frequently) and when he came in and out for his 3, yes 3, encores... and we weren't even far away, just couldn't see the front of the stage other than on the giant screen...the pyrotechnics during Live and Let Die were super except for the fact that all of the smoke dispersed backwards and we were choked momentarily....and it was okay that we were high up because the stage floor had fun lights and technical effects that you couldn't see if you were lower and we always knew when he was about to play the piano because we could see it coming out of the floor....have i mentioned though, that it was spectacular??


Homecoming sucked my will to live.....


In other news, I do not get to have a wonderful white Christmas, as I'm spending my time in Georgia, with my brother telling me that I'm going to go to hell...BUT I get to go to the ocean AND be back in time for a New Year's celebration in Milwaukee!


ok PEACE OUT :-D"

"event","Hi, remember when my paid LJ account ends in 8 days and I couldn't be happier?

And remember when I went home this weekend and as soon as I pulled off the highway, I saw a truck, filled with at least 6 people in the front, and it reminded me of why I don't come home....

And then remember when I almost died 6 times on the way home because people haven't figured out how to drive in WI?

Ok that's all..bye"

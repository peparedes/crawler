"event","The time has come! ""Back To Zero"", the long-awaited debut album by Melbourne theremin-led instrumentalists The Night Terrors, is about to hit stores and blow minds. 

Recorded with Nao Anzai (Laura, Because of Ghosts, Sinking Citizenship, City City City), Back To Zero is 60 minutes of spaced-out synthesiser rock ranging from haunting synthscapes to flat-out analogue noise. It looks and sounds completely amazing and we goddamn love it. 

In only a matter of days all the lucky people of the world will be able to share in our love. It'll be coming out on EXO Records and available in stores around Australia and The US for starters. And - because it'll also be available online - you can get it anywhere in THE WORLD! if that's where you happen to live.

To celebrate this momentous occasion we're having a massive launch/party at The East Brunswick Club on Friday April 10. Our lovely psychedelic popster friends Richard In Your Mind are coming down from Sydney especially and EXO friends/lovers The Emergency will also be joining us in playing our hearts out for your good selves. Those of you who saw us play last time at The East Brunswick will know that the night will be an epic audio-visual spectacular which will make you thirsty.

So if you live in Melbourne town come on down and join us in our celebrations. You can be one of the first people in the world to own a copy of ''Back To Zero''! The time has come! As we plan on becoming quite merry, you could also get the chance to talk to Miles about his theremin boot camp with Lydia Kavina in Oxford and his not-at-all-nerdy three-day theremin festival in Germany!
 

Please note in your diaries, come down and bring your music-lovin' mates, and a few extra clams for a record or two and a highly sexual Night Terrors t-shirt!

"event","Hey there!

Come on down to the Make It Up Club at Bar Open this Tuesday night and see the debut show of a brand new trio:

Chris Hale (Christopher Hale Ensemble, Velure, Tim Rogers Band, millions of other things) - six-string guitar-bass

Miles Brown (The Night Terrors, Dan Kelly & The Alpha Males, general theremin slut) - theremin

Phil Collings (millions of jazzy things, owner of truly awesome name) - drums

This will be a 100% improvised set, and should be an interesting branching out from comfort zones for all three members!

This will also mark the first time in 14 years that Miles and Chris have shared a stage together - the last time being the 1992 year 7/8 social at St. Virgil's College in Hobart. They played Gunners covers. They wore bandanas. Mike Noga (The Drones) was on the drums and stagediving. It was totally rad.

We're hoping for at least three of those elements to be present in this show!

Make It Up Club kicks off at 8pm, and it's $10 / $5 concession.

love Miles

"event","After many moons sequestered on the gloomy distant planet of southern Australia, The Night Terrors finally bring their theremin-fueled synth rock mayhem back to Sydney-town, in support of their new internet single ''Righteous''. 

Spawned from the festering miasma of the Melbourne underground scene, The Night Terrors' blistering electro-noise has been petrifying punters since the year 2000. Their formula of thunderous metal-bass, breakneck drumming, vintage horror synth and the manic wail of the theremin has earnt the Terrors a reputation as one of Australia's most unusual and original bands. 

With a drummer returned from 3 years in Paris, a rockin new synth wrangler (Marika Bardin - LoveCutsKill), more theremin than you can poke an aerial at and a brand spanking new set of killer tunes, The Terrors live to do nasty things to your brain once again in 2007.

They'll be hitting the stage TWICE for Labour Day Eve on Sunday the 30th September: first off with an early all-ages show at <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/warehouseshowroom"">Warehouse Showroom</a>, 9 Bridge St Rydalmere, as part of a sensational bill also featuring the almighty <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/spod"">Spod</a>, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/handmemyjetpack"">Hand me My Jetpack</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/spunrivals"">Spun Rivals</a>! (3pm start, $10)

Then, that whole lineup teleports to the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/oxfordartfactory"">Oxford Art Factory</a>, 38 Oxford St Darlinghurst, for an all-out over-18s mind-blowing spectacular, with <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thelaurels"">The Laurels</a> joining in for good measure! (8pm start, $12) 

It's going to be bloody fantastic!!!

First up, for all you southsiders, and northsiders who aren't afraid of trolls,

The Night Terrors will be hitting the stage at ye olde Revolver Upstairs as part of Mushroom Giant's huge EP launch this Friday the 25th May!

This going to be one hot-ass bill with the spectacular <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mushroomgiant"">Mushroom Giant</a> celebrating the release of their hot new rekkid, plus The Night Terrors - rejuvinated, theremin-wielding and ready for action, hot young things <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/loveissciencefiction"">Love is Science Fiction</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/alaskaratio"">Alaska Ratio</a> opening things up, plus there's some rad exhibition opening earlier on as well. So if you like your art rocky, and your rock quite arty, this will be all the way up your alley. Plus, after the gig you'll be at Revolver, which is its own particular brand of party-out insanity, if you're into that kind of thing. 

$10 on the door, Terrors on at 10.45pm
Revolver upstairs, Chapel St. Prahran.

THEN>>>

...The Night Terrors continue their triumphant resurrection campaign with a super-late club show on Saturday 26th May @ dv8, CBD Nightclub, Mackillop St. Melbourne City. 

Also on the bill are hot goth rockers <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/shadenfreudeband"">Schadenfreude</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/redlightunion"">Red Light Union</a>, plus DJs Lobotomy and Dorian. 

All you kids who love running around trashed at nightclubs listening to blisteringly loud tunes until the sun comes up, this show is tailor-made for you. Everyone else, dust off the Doc Martins and come down for a few million drinks and whip out those dance moves that you can't really get away with at Pony. 

Gig starts at midnight, Terrors on around 2am."

Last few weeks have been pretty goddamn awesome, have just been hangin with cool people and doing crazy things, seeing lots of cool art and generally chillin'. Nice to have a break from Nigh Terrors for a while, the Rotten Chop album is half done, and Dustbunny has been playin some kikass shows! Yaaaaayyy!!

Last Tuesday <lj user=vicious_apathy> dragged me away from theremin scales hell and out so see Dry Kill Logic at the Evelyn, gotta admit I wasnt expecting this to be awesome but it totally was!! Support bands Mammal and Sydonia were ok, but Dry Kill Logic fucking ruled!! Awesome playing, awesome show, and 4 of the biggest guys I've ever seen in real ife! Holy craP!! Cat and I had an awesome time headbanging, moshing and generally being \m/etal!! Then we went home and made frozen pizzas and drank softdrink and laughed at the tv!! Yayyyy!! Thankyou Cat for an fantastic night!!

Friday night had Dustbunny rehearsal, then went cruising with Cat around Port Smelbourne, drinkin slurpies, listening to metal and talking about life - totally rad! The dropped down to Cabaret Nocturne's new venue - which is completely awesome - SOOOOO much better than Dream! Better layout, better vibe, beer on tap!! Yeehar had a very funny night watching Jan take his gear off and ppl generally being trashwhores!

Saturday was ye olde day of stupidly massive houseparty, thanks to James Dodd and Ha-Ha and their lovely housemeats. Dustbunny played to a packed out room of psychotic street artists, metal heads, hip-hoppers, goths, artists and Fitzroy-livers, and the place went bananas!! One of the best parties in ages, sooo huge, have no idea how many ppl were squeezed into that tiny place!!

"event","If you are in the mood for hotness this Friday night, there is but one place you need to be - Cabaret Nocturne's 3rd Birthday bash @ Dream Nightclub!!

The reason?

DUSTBUNNY - the breakbeat-noise-scuzz-metal-industrial-goth-nudist-hyperactive-A.D.D-trash extravaganza will be mounting (!) the stage for a set of mind-retarding pupil-dilating silliness!!!!

Featuring members of The Night Terrors & Rotten Chop, and fronted by the imitable Miss Cat, Dustbunny blew the heads off all who attended the Crazy Warehouse Parties of last summer, and bring their over-sexed bedlam back this Friday night, especilally 4 U!!

Expect crazy breakneck beats, inappropriate nudity, questionable musicianship, excessive consumption of passion-pop and a stage show that'll leave you quivering!!

Make sure to get down to the venue early to get trashed in front of the first band: goth-haircut-sporters Shadenfreude, then present thyself to the front of the stage to be showered in Dustbunny goodness at 10 30pm!!! After that you can enjoy the poundin' electro of Mr. David Thrussel and SNOG!!

Then drunkenly careen around the venue til dawn to the strains of DJs with incongruous names such as Lobotomy, Thomas, Jay, pH, Kosta and Ange!!

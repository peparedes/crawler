"event","Right now, I am not exactly homeless. I am staying with my aunt in my old hood a few miles from where I went to school...all of them (elem, jr. high, and high school). Two days ago, I accidentally washed my iPhone. I threw my sweats in with my other clothing, completely forgetting that my phone was in the pocket. And just like that, my lifeline to all things that kept me sane throughout this tough time was gone. Even after sticking it in rice, I was unable to revive it. I have a friend who will ship me an LG something or other that gets the internet and is on my phone carrier, Sprint. That'll be nice...even if my phone is technically disconnected for lack of bill payment.

From Christmas day on, this week has been amazing. I reconnected with my favorite cousins, all of whom have been incredibly generous. We've gone out, drank, danced and had a good time. My cousin Brandon lives and works in D.C. now, and he's on a binge to eat at all the restaurants he has no access to back home. We've stuffed our bellies at Luby's, Golden Corral, Williams Chicken, Whataburger, etc. So I've definitely been on my fat girl shit. He gave me a few bucks (just what was on him) as did his mom, my aunt Beverly. In addition to getting money from a friend that sold some of my furniture, I'm sitting okay with about $50 for bus fare and food for as long as I can stretch it. I've applied for food stamps and should be getting a card with pro-rated December and January funds on it. I'm excited about that...for the first time in months, I'll be in charge of what goes into my body, and not at someone else's mercy simply because they're footing the bill. I will not buy many processed foods. I'll buy as many fresh vegetables as I can, good ingredients and fresh meats and fish to cook so the food will stick around longer. 
I also have a job interview tomorrow at Ross. I don't know how they'll be able to get in contact with them, unless I give them my aunt's number, which she has suggested...which is a good idea.

Before this, I spent about 2 weeks at my cousin Sonya's...with her, another cousin, and 6 children under the age of 15. As if that wasn't stressful enough, the house was riddled with fearless roaches that encroached on every space, including my pallet in the living room. I killed one of them--which was pregnant. I lost another one... ugh. Washed everything afterward. I think i left a pair of sweats and an umbrella there. Which bothers me. I need those things.

Just sold my iPhone...even in its water-damaged state, I can get $80 for it...which is good, considering I paid 123 for it. :) I can't wait til my birthday. I'll be traveling up north to Minneapolis to see Anna and Mayer Hawthorne. And I have to go...since this is my aunt's computer and she wants to use it now."

"event","It's about time I do more than bitch about what's gone wrong in my life. I'm 27...getting eerily close to 30 and I'm jobless again. I'm applying hardcore and not getting calls for an actual interview. I keep getting screens, and feeling like I'm doing really well with them, but no call for a face-to-face interview, where I can wow even more. I had a couple of interviews earlier this month, but they were with staffing agencies, and I've yet to hear anything from them, except them moving my case around. I was certain Vitamin T would be helpful--more so than Creative Circle--but they've hardly asked for anything except my portfolio. 

This year started off so well...even including the break-up. Why can't I sustain a good thing? What is it in me that seeks to sabotage anything I get good? Is it because I don't feel deserving? Am I unworthy? I basically quit my job because I was an idiot who thought the world owed me something. I acted a complete fool and I'm missing out on making more than I've ever made in my life. But there's always hope that I can find something. I just need to start in the next couple of weeks because I've got until the 15th..

..and I should not worry at all. This is, after all, what thrills me most about life. I'm just tired of making the same mistakes."

I saw a girl I knew from a couple years ago and she led me on to believe that she was sorta interested in me. I walked her to her job (out of my way) and she mentioned to me twice that she got off at three. So imagine my chagrin when i show up to possibly hang with her and she brushes me off with some lame excuse.<br>Tried texting people all weekend to barely get any response. Even texted my ex to see how things were going with her, she said she was great and seeing someone and blessed and basically peaced me out saying ""I hope things keep going well for you"" as if she knew how things were going. I didn't get to say anything about what's been actually going on. </p><p>Goin's on--The Bad<br>-feeling left out and rejected. <br>-feeling rejected by women. <br>-feeling like I'm not good enough. <br>-feeling like I don't look good enough. <br>-not being able to talk to anyone about things like this and being able to trust the advice they give. --really, that's what I wanted from my ex when i texted her and I didn't get it from her, my new friend, my old friends, people I'm currently hanging out with, etc. </p><p>Goin's on--The Good<br>-been working out. When I'm not running or walking, I'm watching g videos and letting Jillian Michaels kick my ass with some cardio. I have never felt so good about how I look and the changes my body is going through. <br>-job. I love where I work and I'm currently trying to figure out how to make a bigger impact and span into other areas of the business. <br>-looking for a place to live. Found a place near downtown that might be in the price range I'm looking for. </p><p>The bad is bothersome and irksome. I just wish I could speak with someone who understood. What's worse is that I haven't had sex since January 30 when my ex fucked me and left the next day. It's weird to have to conjure up your own worth, make it from nothing when you feel like nothing. I just wanna go home and sleep right now. But I'm at someone else's mercy since I didn't drive. </p>"

Just because I didn't get as much sleep as I would have liked because my friend was really lonely and had me stay up way too late with her. She's married (to a woman) and she's upset that her wife loves her job (or is a workaholic, hear her tell it) and she hasn't spent much time with her in a while. <br>The whole thing smells of a sordid situation that I need to disengage myself from immediately. She was laying in my nook while we watched Waiting to Exhale last night and she wanted me to massage her damn near all night. If I didn't care about and respect her wife, much more could have happened. And she was basically throwing herself at me. Out of sheer loneliness. Her wife comes home in about 45 min now and I leave about 45 min later. <br>My new job begins today! I am so excited!! I think I will wear jeans just to be comfortable. </p>"

I don't have money for a deposit anywhere so maybe I'll just go for the whole month to make sure I have all the money I need for moving expenses and deposit and rent. The place I'm looking at right now is really huge and I have a strong feeling that its mine for the taking. It's kind of expensive and it seems like the other rooms will be taken first because none of them are as expensive as this one. I'm excited about it and if it does get snatches up, I think I'll be<br>fine finding another place just as good, if not better. <br>I saw a sexy lady yesterday after taste of Addison and I couldn't not talk to her. ""Where y'all goin?"" I asked her and her friends. ""We're going to the car!"" ""Noooo replace the c with a b and come to the bar with us!"" She laughed and made eyes.

I slipped my card into her hand and actually kissed her cheek as she kissed mine. Mm. My mind ran wild for 20 minutes. <br>Getting better but i still find myself dumbstruck around women I like. I guess I want to be pursued as much as I chase. It's only fair/right to want someone to want you as much as you want them. I haven't felt wanted by anyone yet and that's a very odd feeling. I wish there would be some tall sexy lesbian to subtly chase after me so I can gift her with everything she wants and more. <br>At a softball league meet and there are so many hot women that I find myself sitting in my friend's car pumping out jams from the limited selection of CDs. I'm afraid of Judy going up to and meeting women I want to talk to or otherwise become involved with. I know I just need to have some balls and just walk up to one and state some intentions. But I'm deathly afraid of public rejection...which I shouldn't be, since anything I say is charm and should be taken as compliments. I've never been one to wait idly by while someone decides whether or not they want to approach. But I've been letting girls go by so much in preference of being rejected online. I'm missing opportunities and I shouldn't be. </p>"

chung-chung!

May 11, 2013; 9:07am

I had already been up for about 2.5 hours. I was watching L word and I chuckled out loud once. Then, realizing the day we had before us (my roommate and I), I begin my day. First thing, I decide to change the wastebasket in the bathroom. I was about to vacuum up the carpet in there too but I decided against it before too soon. (for the record, I would have closed doors to minimize noise.)
Live-in-Landlord (LiL) comes out, startles me and yells at me that I'm sooo loud and goes on a rant about how much work she's been doing, how this is her only day off and she wanted to sleep in (isn't 9 sleeping in?), about how I'm ALWAYS loud, and how I NEVER do my own dishes (which I do, but i haven't for the past 2 days. my ""dishes"" consisted of a glad tupperware container, a plate and a fork. I cleaned them within 3 minutes.) She then brought up my herbage smoke (I vape to try and conserve my herb and kick out the scent of my dank herbs. Apparently she can still smell it.) ""you think I can't smell that?! I told you not to smoke in the house!"" LiL said. By this time I'm defensive and upset...so I say ""But you didn't have much of a problem with me rolling you fat joints, huh?"" which I really wish I didn't say. But it was too late. She said I'm out. She didn't give me a note, nor a specific time period. I stepped away, hoping she'd cool off but she didn't. I came back before we (roommie) were to leave to apologize for snapping back at her so harshly and to ask for a second chance, especially since it wasn't my intention to never clean (esp. since I'm the only one that CLEAN cleans the tub, vacuums the carpet in this poorly-designed house's bathroom and changes the wastebasket--all things other people can also do.) she stuck to her guns,  she wants me out.

Rent was supposed to be due on the 19th. I'm thinking she wants to hold me on holdover at 800/mo and I ain't got time, money, inclination or patience for that. That's a good start on a downpayment for a damn ass car. shooo...but anyway, I've enlisted a cool lesbian friend (a bow-legged married woman who is more dyke than her looks let on) to help me take a look at some places. Monday, i've got to get a few appointments lined up for Tuesday. I need to move in a decent place that's not too far from work or friends (or where friends will be), and I need to be able to be respected for the money, consideration and care I bring into the house.

Things to do:
1. finish figuring out the phone switch thing from my ex to a new line. my mom said she'd help out with that..not sure how because i need her id, which i renewed for her, but i think they need a pic? and ex needs to be constantly reminded of shit like this. 
2. line up some appts/application runs for tuesday visits.
3. figure out my debit card from school so I can have a valid Visa with which to reserve moving day vehicle. (hopefully they won't trip too much about it considering we've been figuring it all out since 2 days ago.)
4. write a letter stating that I did not get a written notice of eviction, state when i expect my deposit back and get her to sign both copies (one for me, one for her)
5. plug the holes i made with my guitar mount
6. Wed-Friday--pack every fucking thing back up
7. Hopefully by Friday, I'll have a truck (prolly gonna get a van) and a place to go that's near work and friends. 

Finally,
we hung out with the girl i like today. she's actually older than me by 5 years. she's got a body i covet. she's fine and sexy and ambiguous...just like i like it (appearance-wise!) she's got...must be doubleD cups on this tiny lil frame. She said she didn't like studs (which I don't consider myself to be..I'm more soft butch) Me, my roomie and all our new lesbian friends hung out at her house, played in/near her badass apt complex's pool.

i know that if I were smaller (I'm 5'10"" but I want to be slimmer), I know she'd be into me. She said a lot that she liked me, but it was difficult to read whether she liked me platonically or more-ly. :) i like her more-ly. she could strap it on and fuck me til I'm comatose. but she's so sexy and so much shorter than me (like by a foot!) that i could pick her up, throw her around, dominate her, make her feel sexy and safe in my care and arms. make her eyes roll back into her head and make her splash all over my clit and tongue. What can I say? I'm super horny, but until now, no one has turned it on for me. Now my imagination is running amuck. Luckily, I've got quite a bit to handle this week. We talked about it and she was like ""you'll get it all figured out. just trust in that."" I like that vote of confidence masquerading as nonchalance. I gave her my card. In a couple of weeks, I want to ask her out to lunch or dinner or something. Maybe that concert she was talking about. she seemed more than content with paying her own way, but i would def want to buy dinner. 

Timeframe:
5/12-call mom for mom's day; get to office depot or something to print, sign, date, fax my offer acceptance to new job. Might as well print/sign/fax that phone switch thing too...Monday will be the 2nd of 3 business days that I can do that without starting over. (might just pay my damn balance and begin again since it's easier that way. but i really don't like the option of waiting around for my ex to not pay her measly portion of the phone bill. I don't have time to risk getting cut off because she's not paying.
5/14-present LiL letter demanding deposit in cash by 4-18
5/14-visit places to move with new lesbian friend, hopefully sign one that day
5/15 and 16-secure moving van and start packing/moving
5/18-be mostly moved out
5/19-do final walk-through

when i see a proper path toward my goal, i am determined and adamant to get that task completed. that's why i'm good for the job i'll be accepting and starting on 5/20. that's also why i'll be in a new place by week's end. that's also why i'll be getting fucked and tearing up some good-good in another month or two. so shall it be envisioned, so shall it come to pass."

"event","I had two interviews today. The first one kinda blew. I couldn't feel the interviewers out, they seemed especially guarded. I arrived 10 min early and waited an additional 15 for them to finish up with another candidate and I don't remember them apologizing for my wait. I felt brushed off until she (they're a husband/wife team) asked for more samples of my work. I didn't get home til 6 so I sent them later. She'll have a lot to look at.

The second interview seemed shorter, but pithier. I REALLY like the offices, what I'd be doing there. This job is actually full-time, it's further away and accompanied by a long walk to and from the office/bus stop (yes, I don't have a car yet. YES it does bother me when I think about girls I want to see) but the walk is good for my calves. 

I over-dressed for both interviews but I was still really comfortable. I wore black jeans (no light-colored seam, so you really can't tell they're jeans), a white/pinstripe blouse and a goddamn cardigan. The day started off cool enough. :/

Cool thing about my hair...it's a fucking mohawk and though I curl it into a textured/bedhead mess in the morning, it most inevitably falls flat. When it does, it still looks fucking rad. My bangs sweep my forehead and I have a cowlick on my left side that goes haywire and adds to the sexileximessiness that is me and mine. 

i love toying with perfect strangers whenever i get the chance. on the train ride home, i sat in the furthest back seat and slightly fondled myself to get the attention of a cute girl with studs in her lower lip. it was innocent enough, clasping together my open blouse, playing with my buttons, nibbling on my thumb and sliding it down my chest...it was kind of exhilarating. Especially because it's hard to peg me since I'm so tall (and I wear a size 12...mens) but i'm damn pretty. she couldn't keep her shades off me. and i reveled in it. i deserve to; it's been a long time since i felt like i looked good...and to put on a show and be admired, well..i enjoyed it.

there's this other girl though. she could end up being my best friend or much more. I'm not sure what she likes, if she's with anyone, what her situation is. but we had a ball cuttin up a rug on sunday...and we're gonna do it again next week. Sunday was the best funday i've ever had and she was the cream of the crop. we didn't get to talk much, but she laughed her ass off with me and we danced, got a touch provocative. i hear she likes soft studs (i've played that role, and well) but she looks like she can tear it up herself. that's what i like. hol'up...

i don't know this girl. all i see is her winking and pointing at me on the dance floor and making me laugh (for the first unforced time this year, I may add). she continually motioned me over to dance too. i need to stop making so much of very very little.

and hopefully, ACL this year. I've never been. I'm really liking the new lesbian crew I found through my new roommate. I need to go shopping, but I need to save for my car. I've already spent way too much money and I lost 8 bucks today. i just physically shrugged. I feel like I'm gonna get the second job that's too far away. The guy seemed to like me and my work, but he also seemed really busy. He said I should hear back from him by the end of NEXT week. :/ The first interview said by the end of this week. I hope I get two offers. The first is more lucrative, easier to get to, and an agency. The second is further away, but it seems more fun (it's fuckin Shoebacca!) and I get to do the same thing, just in-house. And full-time...no contractor work like the first one....and the last few jobs I've had. decisions.

on the girl tip...i'll let it go until sunday, when we're all going to a hot spot in Dallas. I'll see then how things go, if they do at all. in the meantime, i'm discovering stuff about me.

i hung off the edge of my bed and did bicycles, sit ups, leg windshields, and leg lifts. my abs feel tighter already. today (and part of last night) i ate pizza...(so bad, but delicious white pizza with veggies only--no meat). Sunday, I ate part of a hamburger patty and gave most of it to a sweet old doggie. :) then we went to great am. hero for subs and i ate half a roast beef sandwich and a cup of fruit. ended up throwing the rest of that sandwich away since i couldn't enter Sues again with it. (see? justa wasting money!) earlier before that, i had had 3 cheese sticks. before the interview, i had a cup of pineapple greek yogurt, and i finished the pizza for dinner. not as bad as it could be, but i really need to go grocery shopping. 

I'm ready to be moving onto my next opportunity. This next step is a step up in my career. With the kind of salary I asked for and benefits, I'll be able to finally get a damn pap (it's been like 7 years and while I enjoy not having a monthly period, my friends that know that intimate detail keep worrying about that...which makes me worry about it too.) And I'll be better able to save up for a condo/townhouse while paying off my student loans.

i kinda wonder if i'm not black enough for some black girls. i'm immensely attracted to black women, but it's like they expect someone who uses language so well to be a slam poet. unfortunately, i find slam poetry to be ostentatious, somewhat lame and redundant. just about everyone has that same voice or the voice of someone else who has the voice of someone else. it's irritating to see someone imitate until they get the support of the crowd. it's like watching an uncomfortable awards ceremony performance. you want to like it, you really do...but your knowledge of what it SHOULD be like and your ethics just won't permit you to.

I don't look like the typical black woman that has long flowy locks or dreds or curls or whatever natural hairstyle is the shit in the ""black community."" I'm a damn near 6-foot tall big black woman who wears a mohawk, rocks gauge-like earrings (thinking of actually getting them gauged though) and sings plenty of genres and in many keys. i find i turn on white women, but i'm just not turned on by any of them just yet. but every black woman that saunters by in a sundress...with sexy shoulders and wondrous calves, or a black stud in glasses and dreds...i'm yours if i didn't seemingly repulse you so with my side-swooped bangs and 6-in tall mohawk."

"event","I'm so sleepy. Didn't get home til 5am. For the first time in over 3 years, I went to the clubs. I kinda want to go again tonight with my roommate, because I only got to dance with one girl and the music kinda sucked, even though it was my friend DJing. It was the same tempo all night, he played the same song about 4 times and I was just begging for the beat to drop...sorta like Jay-Z's part in Suit and Tie.

Kept seeing the same 2-3 girls over and over again...one of them left a huge phone that i tried to open, but she caught me before my drunk ass could figure it out. She was adorable. Then the girl I danced with, she was really cute, thick... why do i get so nervous around pretty girls? We barely danced for half a song. Her hands went around my neck and my friend started to disappear into the crowd. I went after him, half-expecting her to follow me, but that didn't happen. After a few seconds, I found her again and asked if she was getting back out there. She gave me a wave-off...so I may have upset her? guess that's her business. This is kind of why I want to go out tonight, because my roommate is a lesbian too and she'll probably go where girls are. Excited for that. 

I love my hair (should prob upload a pic, huh?) and I'm excited to rock it in my interviews on Tuesday.

OH YEAH!!! I got TWO interviews on Tuesday. One is for an agency in Uptown (swanky new-money part of Dallas) and another is in Irving. Both positions are great and challenging and I can see myself thriving in either place. But the agency in Uptown is an actual agency, which means highly-coveted AGENCY EXPERIENCE! See, I don't have a portfolio full of advertising work I've written or created. On top of that, my title (Copywriter) has a different definition depending on who you ask. Copywriters write copy...so anything you ever read on the internet (be it product descriptions, blogs, articles, headlines, etc) is written by someone like me. So far, my career has stuck around being in-house and writing for a particular company and a specific project, whereas ""agency experience"" allows you to write for a number of clients and accounts and manage multiple projects at once (my nipples just got hard thinking about it!) So of course, agency experience is where I'm leaning. The other job is awesome in its own respect though, as I'd have a lot of independence and get to basically do whatever I want. I'm gonna try hard for both, but I do have a preference.

Every morning, my bus passes this swanky apartment complex where the rent must be over $1000 for a one bedroom. There's this particular unit that is like a huge corner office made of windows. When the bus curves along the road, the sky shoots through this unit so perfectly. I have dreams about having sex in that apartment, her back against the window and her legs and arms wrapped around me. Did I mention it has a balcony that I have also dreamed about having sex on? When I get this job, I'm gonna see about that place.

Been visualizing like a mother-fucker too. Not only do I see myself in that apartment with a beautiful woman, I see myself driving my favorite vehicle (Hyundai Veloster), I see myself settling into my space at my new job (at the agency) and making friends. I see myself working out before work doing pull-ups and killin' them. All of these things are happening.

Yesterday, I went to Denton and popped some tags. My friend gave me a killer haircut, I bought some dress shoes and my clothes came in. I still haven't opened the package. Got a lot of research to do today and I need to get my clothes in the laundry. I guess I'll get started...."

"event","I find myself attracted to the idea of being with someone who is well-accomplished. My last two relationships, I was the leader for the most part. My first girlfriend was definitely on her way and she had moxie and gusto (motivation) to accomplish her goals. That was an incredibly attractive quality. My second girlfriend did not have that, but she was still tenacious somewhat. She was obsessive and wouldn't do anything else until she was done with her work. That was cool and it definitely came from a good place, but it wore on the relationship because all her efforts were financially fruitless for the most part. I was always the breadwinner while she barely had work. So after work, after paying bills, I'd have to still take care of the house by myself for the most part. I did the housework, laundry, etc. And sex would be nice...if I wasn't so tired of working a 40hr work week, PLUS come home to loads of housework to tend to while she sat there fleshing out her portfolio.

I want reciprocity. I love that word and I love what it entails and means. It means at least 50/50...but I'm not even that stringent. I do want someone who can talk to me on an intellectual level, someone who can teach me something, someone who isn't all wrapped up in their own mind and is willing to express how busy their brain is. I want someone who uses their knowledge and skills to enrich their lives with culture, travel and art. I want to travel too and I want to be with someone who knows their way around well enough to sort of take me under her wing and show me the ropes of globetrotting.
I want someone that's eager to learn me and let me learn her. I want someone who knows what they know and is trying to impart their knowledge to learn more about what I know. I want intellectual symbiosis. I want to be engaged, compelled. I want to be fought for sometimes.

There's one person that I know who is a traveler, smart, independent, very cool. She's dredded out and she's a super-intellect. She just pulled an impromptu experiment in a bar and posted about it on facebook...the intellectual discourse and discussion had me so wet and we weren't talking about anything sexual at all. That just means it's been a long time since I've been intellectually intrigued and stimulated. Too damn long. Wasted time dealing with my first, who listened to her clit more than her head...and my second, a quiet, skilled-but not-so-smart introvert who doesn't seem to know how to be happy without somebody around to do the dishes.  
Nah...this time, I'm going for what I want. And because I know I'm not ready, I'll bide my time. Who knows what will come of this summer?

In any case, she's my friend, which is always good to be able to get that intellectual fix I desire through conversation. She's a cool person getting her masters, so I don't want to distract her too much anyway. I've got quite a few things on my plate too, so there's always something to do. Still, curious to get to know more about her."

"event","There are many reasons why I haven't found anyone. The biggest is:
I'm not looking for just anyone. I've only had a handful of relationships, but I'm not one to repeat lessons over and over again to grasp nothing from them. 

The woman I want is secure within herself. She is a go-getter. She is the type that will devestate with makeup on but drop jaws without it. She's kinda stem--can dress it up or down, femme or andro. She's no stranger to hard work and it shows in her financial status and physical being. She understands what sacrifice means and makes for herself the future she wants. She brings the best out of those around her.

I'm in love with her and we've never met. And I'm sure I can't ""find"" her anywhere. She'll arrive when we're ready for each other."

It's been 2 months and she's already seeing someone else. We were together for two years. My ego fucked it all up and she ran away from someone she thought would eventually get worse and worse until they started beating her like her past did. Right when she gave up, I realized what I was doing to push her away. Right when she gave up. And now she's dating someone else. I am so happy for her, happy that she's happy, even if she's not with me. 
Right now, I'm finding it difficult to get over the what-ifs of what has become of us. I don't want to say, ""Well, maybe we'll get back together"" because I don't wanna be put through the torture of hope. Besides, she said she wants to be my friend...that she doesn't want a relationship with me, nor the glint of a relationship on the horizon. I agreed. I lied."

October 23, 2010--a meaningless, mediocre day. Perfect to set some goals. This is why I can't stand New Years' Resolutions...hope wanes way too easily. I pick a day that would be meaningless to most, it's meaningless to me. I add meaning to it by assigning it some goals. For instance, I paid an extra 100 for Logic Express and I just got the new iLife '11, which has upgraded GarageBand, making it even more powerful and quite frankly, helpful. I have a manual and a mini-midi keyboard...perfect to begin. I have everything I need to learn the damn thing. Why don't I learn the damn thing? I was so gung-ho about it back in February--which was the end of it for me...looking back, i can see where i 'checked out'--but dealings with her impeded it most of the time.

I have an amazing body shape that allows me to be both domineering and sensual at the same time (I'm 5'10"" so I carry my weight very well!), I have very white teeth that I take care of and supple lips that are ready for smoochin'!

I'll do 'em both. My best AND worst birthday.
My birthday is February 13th. Suffice it to say, my birthday is never as important as people's birthdays should be. I've never had a boyfriend on my birthday or God-forsaken Valentine's day either, so I usually spend it alone. The worst one was my 20th. I spent the day before, the day, and the day after alone...or working. Really boring.
My favorite was my 20th too. The 4th day, my friends had thrown a surprise party for me...and boy was it a surprise. It was awesome and I had people that I loved around me...it was really awesome.

Second prize goes to my 21st. I had my very best friend with me on that day...of course, I helped her go shopping for Valentines Day, but I didn't care. I really love just being with her. She bought me a red rose and a card and we had general fun together. That night after work, I got drunk for the first time. It was AWESOME!! I still remember what I drank (all of this stuff was free, too!) and I threw a lit Zippo and almost set some karaoke stuff on fire! Then when I woke up the next day, I TOTALLY didn't have a hangover! That was probably the coolest birthday I'd ever had."

"event","- Make a post that contains your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fun (""I'd love a Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real possible things, make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ so that the holiday joy will spread.

- For myself, I try to remember the admonition to be careful what you ask for, because you just might get it.

MY LIST:
1. True Love...like...from THE MAN of my prayers.
2. Friends
3. A new car. (Preferably a Volkswagen New Beetle, 2007 or 08 model with all the trim, manual or auto, and colored like an actual ladybug!) Or...pretty much anything that I feel comfortable in that's reliable and gets good gas mileage...I guess that could mean a motorcycle or something like that too.
4. Mary Kay customers
5. A better relationship with my mom. She thinks it's okay. I know it could be worlds better.
6. A private tutor.
7. More time.
8. Money...enough to pay the bills that my greedy cousin put on my credit...about $10-15,000...there's a little in there for fun. :)
9. Some magic pill that makes people thin with no bad side effects. I seriously walk like all the time and I've dropped nary a pound.
10. Maybe just ONE of these wishes to come true.

If you want my address, start off with emailing me: hottergirl01@yahoo.com"

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief.

"event","But school is fun! First I have a physics course to fulfill my science requirements. My prof is a fast-talking intelligent SOB that knows everything and the chairs are uncomfortable. In fact, the only chairs that ARE comfortable are in my English classes. Go figure.

My Statistics professor is Asian and therefore has a thick accent. She says the word ""measure"" without bothering to pronounce the 's'...so it's something like MEA...ure. It's hilarious!!
My British Lit prof is Indian but she speaks flawless English...amazingly enough. And she gets supremely pissed off when people come in late. THAT is funny as hell! Golly, the first day, like 5 people came in late and she was kind of upset with everyone. Truth is, she had good reason to be. She's new to the school too, but she found her way to class ON TIME...and so did I. It's an insult when you're late to class! Then this dumbass in the back row had the nerve to fall asleep...idiot!
Anyway, I like her. I really wish I'd gone now.

And my lingustics course is so cool. The prof doesn't use textbooks. He's pretty scatter-brained but he's really cool. And funny. Tuesdays and Thursdays are my fullest days and I have to get up at the buttcrack o' dawn (6 am) in order to make it to school on time. Funny, a 10 minute car ride takes almost 2 hours by way of walking and bus. OY!! Y'all, please pray that I can get a car soon!

I've got to work tomorrow at 2...after school at 11. I'll be walking about 4 miles each day tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday. I'm getting in a lot of exercise, but still it's kinda irritating having to walk and get to work all sweaty. And BOY do I SWEAT!!

JEWELLERY!!!!!

You know things have gotten bad when REPORTERS don't even use dictionaries anymore, much less spell check. JEWELLERY.
First of all, the way to pronounce the word is not with -LERY at the end of it. It's simply <i>jewel-ry. JEWEL-RY.</i> That's also the correct way of spelling it, minus the hyphen. I get so freaked out when supposedly educated people say the word incorrectly! ARRRRGGHHH!!!

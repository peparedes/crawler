"event","well this isnt going to be as in depth as i may have originally wanted due to my lack of time right now...but theres just a few things that i would like to mention...

1- im sick of people ""hoin around"" pick some1 and stick with it for at least 2 days...and please for the love of everything holy leave everybody else alone and just let people be happy although i do understand that this may be difficult for u seeing as u are a pathetic excuse for a human being...if in fact that is a term that can be used to describe you
2- i think you should mind your own business and stop nosin into other peoples...especially mine...i dont understand how your gonna go and tell people to lie to me and keep information from me...when u know theyre my best friend and they wouldnt do that in the first place...
3- accept the fact that you are wrong and just know it...i dont need you to apologize...just admitting u messed up would be enough...
4- think twice about what youre doin before u do it...you might be suprised at the effect this has...u bring an aweful lot of drama into life especially when its completely unnecessary...and it gets OLD...FAST...i dont know if u realize it...but u push people away...

and thats all for this evening because i have work to do before bed....more tomorrow??? maybe...."

"event","have you ever had a period of time in your life where all youve wanted to do was cry?...whether it was a day....a week....a month....idc....have you ever felt like no matter what you do nothing is ever going to be good enough?...like YOURE never going to be good enough....at anything...i have...i do...its like everything is goin too fast...and the harder i try to slow it down and grasp everything thats happening...and make ammends with it...the faster everything goes...making it just that much more difficult...and honestly i dont know how much more i can take...i feel like if i could just cry and get everything out...i might feel better...but theres so much goin on im like void to all emotion and feelings...its like being angry and happy and depressed and amused and annoyed and greatful and confused and frustrated and hopeful and confused and so many other things all at the same time...i just honestly have no idea how to put how i really feel into words...all i know is that when things are good around here...theyre good....but when theyre bad...theyre real bad...i dont need for things to be perfect all the time....im just asking for a happy medium....

and on that note...just a random song that semi-relates to a situation that is currently taking place right now...

It's that feeling that someone
Is standing behind me
And I turn around and there's no one there
And it's the sensation
That someone just whispered
Yeah and I still hear your voice but you're not really here
Your memory is like a ghost
And my heart is it's host

I can still feel you just as close as skin
Every now and then
All by myself, in a crowded room, or my empty bed
There's a place you've touched
With your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you

You said you'd love me forever
Then you said it's over
And left me without the missing link
I thought I'd forget you
But I guess I forgot to
And lately I've been too confused to think
When I reach for someone new
It's like I'm touching you

I can still feel you just as close as skin
Every now and then
All by myself, in a crowded room, or my empty bed
There's a place you've touched
With your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you

In everything that moves
In everything I do

I can still feel you just as close as skin
Every now and then
All by myself, in a crowded room, or my empty bed
There's a place you've touched
With your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you
Oh I can still feel you

there it is....and on that note...im going....c*ya"

"event","well...this entry isnt gonna have the whole..The Good & The Bad...categories..sorry to disappoint u cait...but anyway...

something has been up with me lately and im not quite sure what it is...im just really not happy...and i dont know why...well i have an idea...but its personal and theres only like one person that i really tell that stuff to anymore...since u know some people just kinda blow u off and stop talkin to you out of the blue...sorry...i guess i still am a lil pissed about that...but..yea...and it just feels like everyday is a bad day...and they seem to just keep getting worse....i get to the point where i feel like the only thing else that could go wrong...is me dying...but then...miraculously...everything thats left and seems to even be semi-OK...the only things that are keepin me somewhat sane...fall to pieces...i thought this year was gonna be GREAT...and certain aspects of it have been...well 1 at least...but then again everything else seems to be making up for it...and i just dont know what to do anymore...its kind of an overwhelming feeling...

this is tough too...i kinda feel alone...not like ooo i dont have a b/f..POOR ME!!...not that kind of alone...cuz really...itd be nice and w/e...but i dont really care about it all that much right now...its not like im runnin around looking for one...and im not avoiding it either...i dont think...but i just feel alone in the way that no one really understands everything thats goin on...or how i feel...and part of that may be me...because i know that it isnt exactly perfectly clear or anything even close...but i dont really know how to put it in to words...its like everything that i feel is just so strong right now i feel like if i keep it in i might burst...but then i dont know how to get it all out either...i just cant get past all of it...its like being stuck....for good....just STUCK!

and HE...messes me up soooo much more...lol...and its sad...because i LOVE every single minute of it...and i dont even knwo what this feeling is...because is sooo much more that like...but at the same time its not love....but idk....its all total confusion anyway...plus im an idiot and that helps to work against me in this situation...so moving on would be the healthy choice...but honestly...right now...that isnt going to happen...

and him#2and#3 need to back off for real...cuz ur not helping yourselves at all...being pushy...is NO good...

and probably the most important part of this entry...yep...i dont know if YOULL even happen to stumble across this or not...BUT...I DO NOT NEED YOU...i never have and i never will...it amazes me how you think that i am going to sit around and wait for you to come around again just for the hell of it...ive done that for far too long...its been over...i dont know if u realized that or not...but im assuming you havent b/c of recent actions and what was said...i dont like you...not in that way anymore...not even as a person...u  hurt and hurt and HURT other people and then expect to be treated like a king...some1 untouchable...and you expect me to want u...still....HELL NO...the thought of u alone...makes me ill...i dont know if thats exactly the right word...but its as close as i can come for right now...ur unbelievable...and not in a good way at all...i cant stand you...

and on that note...i think im going to go to bed...its been a long day..."

but the rest of today's entry is just gonna be a song that i came across...simply because im too upset to talk about anything more right now...and it just kinda works for the way i feel about something right now...so here ya go...

when you want it it's not there
when you have it you don't care
when i lose it to you in the end...

the heartbreak, the heartache is more than i wanted
we gave up, we made up
it's not like you cared
deception, depression is all that i've got
am i losing what was there?

and i've made up my mind
i'd be better off alone
love is just a waste of time

and all the lonely  nights
and all the crushing scenes
and all the pointless fights
someone tell me what it means
someone tell me why hearts break
'cuz sometimes i think this thing called love is another word for pain

and i'm giving up on happy endings
the one's that are only in movies
where the guy gets the girl and everybody's happy
i think that's the way it should be

"event","been doin a lot of thinkin lately...mostly bout me...not to sound selfish or anything...but yeah...it amazes me how you can truly care soooo much about a certain person and yet they truly dont give a damn about you...and how a simple ""HI"" from some1 unexpected can make the worst day perfect...and how the greatest feeling ever that may follow just hangs around but then the greatest depression you have ever and will ever feel is soon to follow...and then the things people say...maybe out of humor or all seriousness that make you roll on the ground with laughter or smile so honestly and meanigfully that ur face hurts might very well be the same things that make u cry just days later...and how the things u want to believe so much are the same things u regret for thinking, saying or hearing all because its just a sense of false hope...it just amazes me that there is such an extreme positive and negative to every situation...in most cases the bad outweighing the good...

going back to the whole simple ""HI"" comment...this probably wont make sense to most people who read this...but anyway...it made me so happy for such a long time...but then the whole reality of the situation sank it...it was just a ""hi"" nothing more...and yet it left such a wonderful feeling and mark...but the politeness aspect hit me as well...it was a conversation full of small talk...and not much more...it was short and direct and while him being laid back and busy with other things im sure...i was dumb unoccupied and eager to answer...all out of anxiety and nerves most likely...but just the same he makes me feel young and niave just the same...childish even...its an overwhelming feeling really...being completely taken away by some1 for so long...hoping that maybe someday that person might...JUST MIGHT...simply notice you...nothing more...just to notice u would be enough...but then they gotta go and talk to you...not just acknowledge the fact that u exist but they actually speak to you...and let u know that they know who u are and a few...maybe not to many...but a few small details about you...and then keep the conversation going...even asking if u still like ""that kid"" that they keep hearing u like...making personal inquiries about those type of things...even though they know ur ""in love"" with them...maybe not in love...but in awe of them...but anyway..they ask these things like they care...theres that sense of false hope again...because its soo unlikely...soo farfetched...its a waste or time even hoping...dreaming...wishing...

i swear history was meant to repeat itself...

i get so wrapped up in everything that means absolutely nothing...NOTHING...all in HOPE..that maybe it does...that maybe someday everything will work out exactly as ive wanted it to for so long...that when the reality of it all hits me...it hurts...it hurts REAL bad...not just that superficial and meaningless hurt that i usually feel...but like a real hurt...pain that cuts deep...and its silly and desperate...because there was NOTHING in the first place...

so why does it have to hurt more everytime?...will this time be the worst?...

because i leave myself open and susceptible to all of it...and yes...this time will hurt the worst...because although i was nothing to u...cept maybe a ""stalker"" since every1 seems to find that term SOO AMUSING these days...u were so much more to me...u were hope...a simple crush...although it felt like so much more....u were hope...and letting go of hope...or trying...may very well be the worst pain i have ever felt before...

if by chance u happen to be bored and looking around again...and u see this...please dont bring it up if its pointless...its embarassing...and even more so because im shy...yup...really REALLY shy...maybe that comes off as bitchy or concieted...maybe even stuck-up...but i swear im not...just lost and confused...and semi-lonely...oo what i would give for u to just know all of this...not like it would ever make a difference..."

the bad...
    CHARLIE....yep one word...idk...its just like im not allowed to be happy or feel good about myself when hes around...if somethings goin great hell find a way to mess it up...if im happy....hell pick and pick and pick until the self esteem level just hits bottom...if im in a good mood due to one small moment of my life that meant enough to me to make me happy for a few days...hell say something to absolutely ruin it...even if he has to make up a bunch of complete bullshit just to make me feel like hell...afterall how could anything good ever happen to me...how could anyone ever waste there time talking to me...what ever...but the minute u may act out of anger in the slightest way towards him for making u feel like u are less than nothing...ur a BITCH...sometimes it gets worse too...i hope u read this charlie i really do...ur a good person...and a good friend....but sometimes u really have a way of makin me feel like shit...even if u dont mean to...thats what happens...

Went campin last week...madd fun...wish i didnt have to come back yet...it was just really kind of nice to get away from all the stupid shit that everyone seems to revolve around...it was right across from some river...really pretty with the waterfalls and all...i could have just sat down there all day...i honestly had my doubts about the trip tho...cuz of the bickering that often takes place...but it really wasnt that bad...got knocked pretty hard with a pillow the first night tho...simply cause i couldnt stop laughin...it was crazy...knocked my head pretty hard on the ground too cause the air matress went flat....but other sleeping arrangements were made...chris fell in the river...and bruised her foot pretty bad....wish i could have seen it...saw some orange mushrooms on a walk...and a ""bears butt""  haha...burnt my fingers pretty bad...on a rock none the less...not to smart...but we all have our moments...seemed to piss some1 off pretty good at the restaurant too considering he didnt want anything to do with me after dinner...HAHA...oo well....then daddy let me drive....like 15 whole feet....but it was in the truck...i thought he was kiddin but NOPE...

went to warped tour on wednesday...very very very AWESOME...chris and lissa were gettin a lil freaked during nfg...MADD FUN....buddy was a big help though....then ""hott girls get free hugs""...i got my hug and a dollar....haha...

"event","<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma>I know we don't talk anymore and there has even been times I've noticed we've walked right by each other without saying a word. There are those times, however, when we see each other... make eye contact... and I know, no matter how hard we both try and hide it... that you miss me just as much as I miss you.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma>
<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma>Everyone is always askin me whats wrong... but i dont even think it makes any sense, its just... my heart hurts </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma>Why can't you just tell me how you feel, because how you act is confusing me ... I mean, you walk by me like I'm no one, you smile at me like I'm anyone, you hug me like I'm someone ... but kiss, the way you kiss me, it's as if I'm the only one. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Tahoma>After all this time you still have this amazing power to make me feel absolutley crazy each time I see you</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>its this continuous cycle of me falling over and over again.. but he always catches me just before i hit the ground.. then takes me to the top, let's me go... and i fall all over again. and you'd think, just once i'd say.. ""you know, maybe i dont feel like going back up there with you"", but instead i do the opposite and practically let him blindfold me and take me himself... with no control of my own, i give him everything... and for some reason expect to be okay afterwards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I </FONT>thought by meeting this new guy, talking to this guy on the phone all night, and looking foward to seeing HIS face everyday... it would make me stop wanting you. That wasn't the case at all, instead, when I talked to this guy, or when I looked at this guy... all I wanted in the whole world was for it to be you.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Maybe he's doing the same thing as me.. maybe he wants so bad to call me, but just won't because I haven't called him... then again, maybe I shouldn't fill myself with false hope that he might just be missing me like I'm missing him</DIV>

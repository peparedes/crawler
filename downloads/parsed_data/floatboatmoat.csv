"event","Sometimes I wonder what I am trying to prove.

Am I trying to prove that I am capable of great things, things that the average person would never be able to complete? Am I trying to prove to myself that I am capable of so much more, more than I could even dare to dream of? Or am I trying to prove that youth is limitless, fear is nothing, that nervousness and self-doubt is fuel for achievement and invincibility?

Opportunities are hard to come by, by once they start they come following in troves like bees to sweet honey. There comes a point in time when I have to make a definite choice, sometimes saying &#39;no&#39; is the easier option because it saves me a whole ton of grief and what-ifs and sleepless nights stressing over problems that hopefully never see the light of day. But I say &#39;yes&#39;. Because I am young and hungry and greedy; every &#39;yes&#39; leads to an opportunity that lets me uncover a part of me I never knew I had, every deep breath I take while shaking in fear, every unkind thought I have while scolding myself for a job not well done reveals to me my weakness, every addition to my resume I give myself an invisible pat on the back. I might not have done brilliantly, but my CV betrays nothing.

Youth is finite, but my dreams are endless."

things that sparkle under the light, fascinating flashes of bokeh
sometimes i look up at the sun without shielding my eyes
and they hurt, but the blinding white that follows fascinates me
is this temporal, or is this forever?
i blink furiously, almost disappointed when vision returns
slowly, but surely

sometimes you are like the momental blindness i wish for
a burst of blue, pink and bright yellow

you are the one i can never have

This is a rarer than mewtwo LJ post! The only reason why I'm doing is cause I'm in the central library waiting for the last episode of Dream High to load so I can look at Samdong's cute face and stare at Suzy's perfection.&nbsp;

Also I know I've been ranting about school and telling people about how unhappy I am but secretly, deep down inside...

I think I'm feeling okay :)"

The weather gets really rainy in the afternoons but omg it is like airconditioned awesomeness at night! So much for summer guys. My hostel is really clean which is great. My roommate doesn't speak much but she's nice enough, I'll take what I get hahaha. Today we went to Ewha (twice) shopping street and I got to drink Banana Milk!!!!!! Omg it is so good okay I will drink it every other day when I am here. Also I had Kyochon Chicken!!! It was quite good, I don't really like fried chicken but this chicken is like 836725 times better than KFC. Like seriously.&nbsp;

It is almost 12 here now and I was really tired but then I watched We Got Married featuring my Thai Prince and that Chinese slut (haha just kidding f(x) are my daughters) with Naz Jom and Belle and now I'm filled w jealousy so I cannot sleep hahaha. Just skyped with the family, and wl we are really damn noisy.&nbsp;

Placement test is tmr, my Korean is currently nonexistent so erm, all the best to me! Fighting!!!

PS: Haha I am reminded of the fact that I bought a 1500 won Daiso cup w a Fighting! logo on it hahaha awwww so qt

PPS: Pictures in tmr's post promise!! Too tired to upload plus I didn't take that many today cause I was the walking dead today before my 1 hour break

Have fun friends!"

"event","Long weekend!&nbsp;

Today I went out with Jomaine and I bought so many things! This is definitely the best way to spend your holidays, going out shopping and spending 10% of your pay on pretty things. I really like shopping, it is like my favourite thing to do.

Work has been alright, but I cannot happier that I am ending on Wednesday! People there have been really nice to me, but I do not like office jobs. Filing filing filing typing typing gmail chat filing filing I even have a paper cut to prove it!

There are too many things that I want to buy, places I want to go to, people I want to meet. For the first time in a long while I feel like twenty four hours in a day should be spent less on sleep but more on doing things that I will remember, things that I can only do when I'm young and free of responsibility.

When I go to Korea (less than a month's time!!) I will&nbsp;take photos everyday climb a mountain ride a rollercoaster eat ice cream order chicken and see and do things that I will remember when I am seventy and wrinkly




Also I will cut my hair."

I'm supposed to be at Tang's house lou-hei-ing w the other art kids but I decided to ditch in the end cause Orchard sales beckoned and I was extremely lazy (as usual) and punggol is so oh my god far, so sorry Jeri! I will go next year... I think haha. Marjorie's leaving for Australia later and that makes me sad. Reminds me of all the fun I used to have w her and Jomaine and Yangle and Arjun (our very own black slave) in our lang arts group awwww memories :`) I hope she cries at the airport later hahaha omg i'm so mean! I mean this in the most affectionate way possible, if that makes sense.

Oh and just yesterday I listened to my old friends Franz Ferdinand and Razorlight for a whole 2 hours! I was surprised at how I could remember almost all of the lyrics to their songs, and how genuinely happy I was when listening to all the ~oldies but goodies~ hahaha aww I wonder how is my old friend Johnny Borrell. The current Razorlight sucks big time (their first album will always be gold) and idk what happened to FF but they were awesome and I sincerely hope that they still are. I promise to always sing to the opening of Do You Wanna even when I'm 89 and hard of hearing. WELL DO YA DO YA DO YA WANNA"

And the backup singers sang one of my favourite SNSD songs amazingly. And I totally saw the top of taemin's head up close before the concert! I know this sounds <em>really</em> strange but I did. P.S: Taemin you may wanna get a dye job soon your roots were totally showing<br /><br />Plus the fact that SHINee totally looked at Nazurah and I at some point in time cause we are amazing fans hahaha I am (completely) serious. Their awesome pitch perfect &gt;CD&nbsp;performance left me clutching my hands to my fangirly heart and makes me wanna... master korean so I can be like bffs w Key and go shopping together for the ~coolest threads~ while he tries to disguise himself w ridiculously colourful scarves and a huge beanie that covers half of his face. And then we meet taemin onew minho and jonghyun in a cafe where onew will proceed to order chicken (even though it's starbucks) and taemin will order lasco. &nbsp;And then I will laugh at jonghyun's height together with minho.<br /><br />Sounds like a plan!!!<br /><br /><br />"

Not that stuffs isn't a word, but I get strangely annoyed whenever people misuse the verb for the noun. It is fine if used for sentences like &quot;He stuffs everything into his mouth&quot;, but totally uncool in my book if used as &quot;I&nbsp;have so much stuffs to do!&quot; Like idk about you but it drives me CRAZY. I&nbsp;also want to die whenever people spell &quot;your&quot; instead of &quot;you're&quot;. Or spell &quot;weird&quot; as &quot;wierd&quot;!!!!!&nbsp;ARGH one major pet peeve, the last one. Sometimes I&nbsp;want to shake them by the collar but obviously I do not do that (physically at least).<br /><br />It's not like my english is flawless (B&nbsp;for GP&nbsp;asdfgh) but argh I feel like stabbing myself with a blunt pencil (not ready to die yet) whenever these things happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />Okay am obviously not in the best of moods, totally justified since I just remembered that I am supposed to complete some crazy church website in 2 weeks with like, virtually nadah to work with.

The very last entry was about how I deduced Zinc(?) in some Physics lab test, which was obviously wrong since everyone else had some other (insignificant) metal. And then my switch in that test or something died. Plus I calculated &quot;a single digit R when everyone else had, like, 3 digit ones&quot;.&nbsp;<br /><br /> I have completely no idea what I was talking about but zomg, I&nbsp;sounded really really really depressed back then! That was during the Promo exams period, and every single post I&nbsp;had was about my impending doom and how I was helpless against the System. This reminds me of my personal identity crisis that I was having around that time, and how some of the IP teachers found out about my supposedly top secret plan to quit IP&nbsp;and go enrol myself into some poly and all the unnecessary how-are-you-Rachel-do-you-need-to-talks that ensued... must have been a result of all those critical thinking shit Lang Arts made me develop. Haha I was so drama mama then. But I survived unscathed, suckers! Well... relatively so. <br /><br />Also, I don't give a flying shit you didn't send me a good luck sms on A level results day, Jaya!&nbsp;<br /><br />God I&nbsp;must be high on something right now, what am I&nbsp;saying?!&nbsp;Must be the carbohydrates from breakfast.<br /><br />Anyway I cannot wait to quit! Yes yes yes come April 30 I will have my life back. I promise to wake up only at or after noon on May 1st.&nbsp;<br /><br />PS:&nbsp;Happy 19th&nbsp;G!

Anyway there are so many courses that I&nbsp;am interested in!&nbsp;I&nbsp;am definitely going to apply for ADM, but then there are also New Communications and Media, Communication Studies, Japanese Studies (Hahaha Plan B)&nbsp;and also Architecture. Is architecture fun? I want to design buildings, but am so totally not interested in the math and physics involved. God I hope I&nbsp;get into ADM.

Work is so routine and boring, does not help that I&nbsp;am no longer teaching some of my favourite classes. I want to quit! Then I will not have to wake up at 6 everyday. But No Work=No $$$=No Korea Trip. Why is life so difficult. 

Well, at least I&nbsp;have wireless connection.

/edit:

Jeridyn (to me on architecture):&nbsp;You should contribute to our arts and media industry and leave those math shit to others.

Makes sense! Sayonara architecture, what was I&nbsp;thinking!"

Thanks for filling my poor heart with anticipation and longing and wringing it right where it hurts. &nbsp;So much for wanting to make up for Mosaic. And for wanting to hear&nbsp;Ben&nbsp;Gibbard whisper 'from the passenger seat, yes, you were driving me home'. I could go on and on and on, but I will only get agitated, and agitation is stupid because it doesn't solve anything. Or give me tickets to any of the above. Wait, tickets are not the problem, THE A LEVELS ARE.<br /><br />Urgh&nbsp;the problem of the 21st century is&nbsp;the futility of <em>education</em>, futility of war is overrated. I hate Owen. <br /><br />"

"event","Hong Kong was crazy! If given a choice I would gladly set up tents in Mong Kok and stay there for the rest of my life. <br /><br />Okay more after I hustle and go grab photos from people, I think I may have to sign up for a Facebook account to do this. Facebook scares me. What if people invite me to food fights/ give me a plant? I wouldn't know what to do. Technology is stupid. <br /><br />edit: It is possible to die from coursework overload. I am typing but my eyelids are closing... closing... Friday the 13th is <em>9 freaking days away</em> and I only (!!!) have 3 approved (well, self-approved) pieces that I'm definitely going to show. I have to crawl back to school at night next week with Ser En so that we can pull off a Warhol and get our silkscreen prints done. Mr Tang is totally on my case, on my back, on my everything, HE IS SO INTENSE. Why must Life be so Difficult? And all I wanted to do this holiday was to, you know,&nbsp;go shopping."

"event","I am so excited about Hong Kong! Think of all of the inner city shophouses, dimsum and shopping! It's going to be summer so everything will be wonderful. No miserable fogs or rain or Bad Weather. Will I throw up after the plane ride (I get so terribly airsick)? Will I have fun in Ocean Park (I really wanted Disneyland instead)? Will I bump into Edison Chen!!??

Anticipation!"

43/66 which translates to a 65/100 which translates to a B! Binomial distribution and probablity (well, maybe not probability) have got nothing on me. I am invincible and happy."

Art can go suck it, even Hawthorne Heights isn't keeping me awake. Yes seriously Hawthorne Heights!! God, the last time I've listened to them was probably circa 2004. Argh whatever I will slay this monster yes I will. Maybe I should actually be listening to Chromeo instead...<br /><br />edit edit:&nbsp;Highlight of today was&nbsp;eating pizza and singing to Britney Spears and Atomic Kitten(!!!) I have zero idea about what to do with my coursework anymore.&nbsp;Oh wtv I am going to watch Across the Universe and go to bed early. I swear, art was never supposed to be this draining."

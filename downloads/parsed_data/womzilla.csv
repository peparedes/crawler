I'm disappointed in myself that so few of the comics here are written by women (just 4 out of 26). I did read a lot of other comics written by women that didn't quite make this list, but I honestly would have expected better than 15% in my long list."

 <blockquote><b>Gamersgate: STFU</b>
by Greg Costikyan on 09/07/14 12:55:00 am

""As a male voice in the game industry,"" writes my daughter Vicky, ""you should speak out about this.""

Ouch.

I wanted to hold my tongue. Because when I let loose, it usually does me no favors. But she's right.

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

What do you think you're defending? An industry in which greed-head executives make brain-dead games on a yearly basis that show little to no innovation from one title to the next? You fucking -want- Madden? And the next Call of Duty game, same as the last but with new content from hundreds of exploited drones working hours that destroy relationships because the suits think that's what they want?

For decades, we had a market that catered to Maxim-reading horny boy-men who bought games by developers who spent man-years on developing better physics to make tits bounce in the next beach volleyball title. For decades, we had shameless manager jackasses who thought the best way to market their titles was to hire high-breasted bimbos to pose and giggle at their booths at E3.

For decades, we had the best creative minds of our industry SHUT DOWN whenever they proposed the slightest design innovation, because increasing budgets meant all design risk must be minimized.

For decades, we had no way for people who wanted to do anything creative be able to find any path to market.

Finally, finally, and thank god, we have a viable path of market for indies, and a way for people who want to express themselves through games that will never sell in the millions to find a market. And you find that a PROBLEM?

What kind of blinkered idiots you are?

And of course, indies do whatever the fuck they can to get noticed, because they don't have MILLIONS OF MARKETING DOLLARS TO SPEND. What the fuck would you expect?

Let me explain something do you. Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision: Mutimillionare. Anna Anthrophy? Stroppy indie developer who probably has problems paying her rent. Who has the power here? What the fuck are you talking about?

There's some kind of conspiracy by the in-group to promote indie games at the expense of ""real"" games? What the fuck are you talking about? Who cares who Zoe Quinn fucked, or didn't fuck? It's none of your fucking business, unless you were one of the people involved, and most of you would give your left kidney to fuck her, if you had any brains. You are unlikely ever to touch anyone with an iota of her talent or intelligence.

And what does that even mean? Have you suddenly noticed that the game industry is undergoing weird changes as a result of this supposed conspiracy? The next Call of Duty being cancelled in favor of triple-A treatment of the next Anna Anthropy design?

Do people who actually care about whether games can be more than degraded violence porn for young men sometimes get together and talk about games that actually matter? And do they sometimes write about such games?

You're fucking right they do! And you should be fucking grateful that someday a more mature and interesting landscape of videogames may emerge from that! That's not what we call ""conspiracy;"" that's what we call ""gamers who care about games.""

And what is it with this mysoginistic bullshit?

I want to tell you some stories.

1. The studio head who invited me -and a female employee- to join them at a strip club at a conference, expecting we would all enjoy this as a 'fun time.'

2. The party given by an industry marketing firm where I and Dan Scherlis were approached by a scantily clad woman who was evidently hired to show their clients a good time (not necessarily including actual fornication) and had to explain that we were both involved with people we cared about, and actually were having a perfectly enjoyable time talking to each other.
 
3. The -very- gay friend of mine who was hired by another firm and started sweating when I approached their booth at a conference, in fear that I would reveal his sexual orientation to his new boss.

4. My friend, Dan Bunten, a seminal figure in early PC gaming, who decided he was a woman, and after extensive surgery, became Danielle Bunten Berry. ""Shabbily treated"" wouldn't even begin to describe it.

I have no idea why gender and such is even an issue in this conversation. Women have always been a minority in the games industry, to its loss; but they have never been entirely missing. Roberta Williams created the Sierra adventures. Brenda Garno, later Brathwaite, later Romero, was one of the key talents behind the Wizardry series.

If you look at recent IGDA surveys, 80+% of all jobs in the industry are held by men. This is a problem, particularly as industry surveys say that a majority of gamers are women. To be sure, they're playing Candy Crush and not Call of Duty, and maybe that doesn't qualify as a ""real game"" to you, but if so, fuck off. Games are games, games are good, and it's great that more people are playing them. Stop masturbating with your console controller and get a life.

Anita Sirkeesian has told some pretty obvious truths about the treatment of women in games; controversial ones, and others are free to debate them, but ""debate"" doesn't normally involve threats to rape or kill.

You can like, or not like, Zoe Quinn's work; tastes vary. But her sex life is not, and never has been, any of your fucking business.

Leigh Alexander is one of the most interesting journalists working in games.

This is bullshit, you are assholes, and shut the fuck up.

Deal with the fact that not all games are, or will be in the future, the same corporate crap that you apparently love so much. And understand that the money-grubbing entities who dole out this crap will continue to feed your fix, because it's a far larger market than is reached by the indie people, whom you despise and spit on, can possibly ever hope to reach.

You're attacking people who have problems making their rent, apparently in defense of people who make millions off your fanboy lusts; and somehow feel threatened by people who love games -- as I supposed you do -- but love games that are a little different.

You are assholes.

Worse, you are poor examples of men. Men, good men, defend women. They do not attack them.

To which end: To defend the honor of Anita Sirkeesian, Zoe Quinn, Leigh Alexander, or yes, Anna Anthropy, I will be willing to meet any of you, on horse or afoot, with sword or pistol, at a time and place of your choosing.

It is time this stopped.</blockquote>"

"event","While we were gone at <a href=""http://detcon1.org/"" target=""_blank"">DetCon1</a>, I got an e-mail from Drew <s>Breese</s> Beebe, a reporter at Bloomberg TV, who had been assigned to do an article on comics to tie in with Comic-Con International (aka the Sandy Eggo Comic-Con). He had come across my name in a <i>Bloomberg Business Week</i> <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-30/those-comics-in-your-basement-probably-worthless"" target=""_blank"">article from last year</a> about comics fans my age discovering that their collections were, in fact, almost worthless. He wanted to do a piece about comics collecting, with some discussion of the financial aspects but ranging over as many subjects as I felt comfortable discussing. 

Given that I am an attention whore whose primary mode of discourse is the lecture, I was happy to oblige, so Tuesday night we rendezvoused at <a href=""http://www.carminestreetcomics.com/"" target=""_blank"">Carmine Street Comics</a>, my Friendly Neighborhood Comics Shop and the store that has the portion of our collection that is for sale. We talked and filmed for about 4 hours, at Carmine Street, in his car, and within Valentine's Castle. Most of the discussion at home was me solo in my study, but <lj user=""nellorat"" /> joined us in the basement to show off the comics-filled filing cabinets. 

I will confess that I had some fear of being made ridiculous (well, more ridiculous than usual), but Drew called back on Wednesday with a follow-up question about the collapse of the industry in 1994-95 that he would only have asked if he were serious about the subject. 

The piece <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/video/see-comic-book-superfan-s-30-000-issue-investment-U0AKz9GZTMmB4Bi23hgwDA.html"" target=""_blank"">went live on Bloomberg TV this morning</a> and I'm very impressed at how it came out. It's really well-edited, both in the sense of finding many of my most interesting and concise statements and in the juxtapositions of words and image when it's not just my talking head. 

nellorat points out that the article doesn't convey the degree to which we are also drowning in books, fanzines, stuffed toys, <i>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera</i>, though he did manage to work in a reference to the ratties! 

Go, enjoy. 

Footnotes: It is in fact very unlikely that I have spent $100,000 (net) on comics, even if you lump in things like traveling to comics conventions. However, the figure is closer to $100K than I care to admit. Of course, we moved to New York so that I could pursue a job in comics which never materialized; that cost quite a lot of money. <i>Deathmate</i>, which triggered the collapse of the comics industry in the 1990s, finished in early 1994; the Marvel bankruptcy was about 2 years later, not quite as immediately as I implied. I did not woo nellorat with <i>Swamp Thing</i>; she had rediscovered that on her own (though I did, many moons later, get her a copy of #20, Alan Moore's first issue, which precedes ""The Anatomy Lesson"")."

(I'm trying not to repeat characters or creators or else easy inclusions would be Ditko/Lee's Doctor Strange in <i>Strange Tales</i>; Gerber's <i>Defenders</i> and <i>Man-Thing</i>; Stern/Romita's <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i>; or Lee/Romita's <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i>. I'm also very partial to Peter Gillis's run on Doctor Strange, which spanned the final issues of the first <i>Dr. Strange</i> series, the 1980s <i>Strange Tales</i> split-book, and the first few issues of the second <i>Dr Strange</i> series. The Moench/Gulacy/Day/<i>et al.</i> <i>Master of Kung Fu</i> absolutely should be in the list, but it's not available through Marvel Unlimited.)"

"event","My grandmother had a younger brother, Manny, who (with his lovely wife Katrina) had seven children. Five of my cousins* live in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and have been asking me to come visit them for, I exaggerate not at all, 27 years. Well, I'm finally here. 

*Strictly speaking, they are my first-cousins-once-removed, but screw that. Cousins it is. 

I am staying with cousin Wanda and her husband Ken in Southlake; they took me out for some superb BBQ at Feedstore BBQ on South White Chapel Blvd, which apparently really was a feed store that sold BBQ on the side until they realized where their strengths really lay. The ribs are among the best BBQ ribs I've ever had, and the fries and fried okra were very strong as well.

Today, my cousin Sylvia and her husband Roy took me to the one tourist attraction I really was not going to miss: Dealey Plaza. We spent about 15 minutes walking the site--the locations of the limousine on Elm Street are helpfully marked with Xs, and there were information hobos helpfully pointing out interesting things like the rail switching tower from which Lee Bowers thought he saw smoke behind the wall atop the Grassy Knoll. I stood by the pylon from which Zapruder made his film and realized that if someone HAD been shooting from there, he would have had to have known--he was, like, 5 feet away from the wall himself. So that was informative. Then we took the tour of the <a href=""http://www.jfk.org/"">Sixth Floor Museum</a>, which was surprisingly great. Besides the thrill of morbid authenticity of seeing the sniper's nest and the approximate view a shooter there would have had (you can't look out sniper's window, but you can look out an adjacent one), the museum itself is an extremely well-made JFK retrospective, covering his entire life, death, and legacy as well as the rounds of examination of the assassination. Display objects are well-chosen (e.g., cameras like those carried by the various witnesses; actual teletype rolls); the descriptions on the objects are well-written and fair; there are several extremely good short films on the subjects. 

The exhibit doesn't flinch from the assassination; in one of the best pieces of the museum, a short hallway has stills from the Zapruder film on one wall and stills from another film from a reverse angle on the opposite wall. (I think this is the Nix film.) The exhibit presents a wide variety of alternate interpretations respectfully, if briefly. All in all, time and money very well-spent, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to one and all.

Tomorrow we are going to Fort Worth's landmark Mexican restaurant Joe T. Garcia's, and then I'm taking a bus to Austin. I'll be there overnight and then head down to San Antonio on Thursday for Worldcon.

My cousins are wonderful hosts, and it has been great spending many uninterrupted hours in their company, getting more of a sense of them as individuals. I highly recommend sharing ancestors with them."

"event","While writing a long comment to <a href=""http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/2013/06/men-of-steel.html"">Marc Singer's very perceptive short essay on <i>Man of Steel</i></a>, I made this aside: 

<blockquote>The first <i>Iron Man</i> movie made me realize that I have exhausted my tolerance for superhero stories where the good guy wins just by being a little more gooder, or more strongerer, or because the story has to be shaped that way.</blockquote>

Note that Singer's essay and my comments both have some discussion of significant plot surprises for MoS. 

To elaborate on that aside (massive spoilers ahead for <i>Iron Man</i>): 

In <i>Iron Man</i>, the big fight has two climaxes: Tony Stark leads Obadiah Stane into the stratosphere, where Stane's suit ices up, an established problem with the early generation of the suits. Stane appears to die, but shockingly surprises Tony on the ground; Tony manages to fuddle his way through the fight until Pepper blows up the rooftop reactor at Stark Industries, killing Stane and nearly killing Tony. 

The script gets the two climaxes of the fight scene in exactly the wrong order. Blowing up the reactor should have come first, with Stark and Stane miraculously both barely surviving with badly damaged armor. THEN Stark should have lead the chase into to the stratosphere that iced up Stane's suit; Stane falls, inferior suit shatters, Stane dies. Stark could even try to save Stane as he falls, but oops, the fight has left his suit so badly damaged that he just can't catch him. In this ordering of events, Stark wins by virtue of his defining trait--he's the best inventor in the world--and Stane dies of his own malice.

"event","Last Friday, I started noticing occasional pain in my left ribcage and shortness of breath. <a href=""http://womzilla.livejournal.com/41009.html?thread=100657"">For reasons I've explained at length before</a>, these are worrying symptoms, but they were so intermittent that I didn't reach the obvious conclusion. I was also occasionally coughing. 
 
Well. By Wednesday evening, the pain and the shortness of breath were much more undeniable and were accompanied by thoughts of impending doom--the embolism trifecta. So when I got home--after a very uncomfortable train ride from Grand Central--I informed <lj user=""supergee""> & <lj user=""nellorat""> that I needed to go to the emergency room. I had intended to drive myself, but Nellorat said, ""Call an ambulance--I'm not going to have you stopping breathing on the way."" 
 
The ambulance was there pretty quickly. I walked in, laid down on the stretcher, and they gave me oxygen and asked me questions. The key question, that hadn't occurred to me, was ""Does it hurt when I touch you <b>here</b>?""--with ""here"" being a  muscle group immediately to the left of my left nipple. Holy shit, did it ever! And it was clearly muscle pain, not pain within the lung. Which, frankly, solved the entire question, as far as I was concerned. 
 
On Monday last (April 15), my ear/nose/throat doctor gave me a steroid shot in the hope that it would reduce my allergic response. I'm strongly allergic to aspergillum mold and mildly allergic to rat urine. The injection was quick and painless, but I've been sore at the injection site, my left triceps, ever since. 
 
What I hadn't realized was that the pain was spreading to other muscles on my left side, especially in the shoulder and the chest. When the EMT touched the muscle (pretty sure it's the pectoralis major), he made me realize exactly how much pain I was carrying through the surface. I was in pain, yes, and breathing shallowly as a result. 
 
But by that point, I had started down the ER path, and it wasn't really possible to step off. N. met me at the hospital, for which I'm eternally grateful. I was checked in, put on a bed in a hallway, and then basically ignored until midnight, at which point I told N. to go home, since it was clear that no one, including me, thought I was in any real danger. The night dragged on; there were several screaming children over the course of my stay, and I can barely even recreate how horrible it must be to be in screaming pain and too young to communicate about it. But at least the screaming covered up any snoring I engaged in as I dozed on my hallway bed. 
 
I eventually got an ultrasound reading on my legs and (far later) a CAT scan with iodine contrast, pretty much the same diagnostics I got during my last embolism scare. There was absolutely no sign of unwanted clotting, so I was finally released around 5:30 AM on Thursday with a prescription of ""take a lot of Naproxen right now and then a lot of ibuprofen over the next few days while the pain persists."" 
 
Lessons learned: 
 
A) Steroid shots: don't just blindly accept them. 
B) If possible, don't go to an ER in the evening. 
C) If I think I have an embolism, tell them to do a full-body CAT rather than letting them waste time with an ultrasound. If there's a clot in my legs, the CAT will find it. 
D) Bring a mass-market paperback rather than a heavy trade paperback. My left arm was very sore from the muscle problems, my right arm was sore from the IV, and my phone battery ran low long before I was sent home, so I had nothing to read for long periods.
E) Everyone should have a pussycat to keep them company. Oh, wait, I knew that one already.
F) I am so glad I have health insurance. I hate living in a country where that's an issue."

So, every now and then, one or another trader will stop and look over the wall to find out what I'm eating that smells so damn delicious. 

Last week, after one particular trader had expressed delight in the smell of my fajita, I had this conversation with her over instant message:

"event","<a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/serenaobhrai/join-elysia-on-her-journey"">Here's a comics Kickstarter project</a> that showed up on <i>The Comics Beat</i> today. It looks like an interesting project-<a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/473/437/72b5893e32780b56fed5514b4d34e137_large.jpg?1364391873"">-pretty colored pencil work</a> with <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/465/074/c212f0bc1b34b215a8171269c984885b_large.jpg?1364057992"">a decent visual storytelling sense</a>. 
 
I doubt I'll be backing it. 
 
Most of the Kickstarter projects I back are games, comics, or books. The books and games I back are almost always competitively priced with professional publications--because a lot of them <b>are</b> professional publications, from established companies using KS as a risk mitigator, or from new companies that have really thought through the business implications. Books likewise. 
 
Comics, though--it really seems like the prices are chosen by ""I'd like to make $X on this comic, let's just set the price wherever we want and hope for the best."" 
 
I groused a few days ago about how overpriced many comics Kickstarters are. This one--<i>Elysia</i>--looks like a poster-child for that. #25 ($38) plus #8 ($12) shipping for a 100-page, magazine-format, paperback color GN? That's INSANE, even before you take into account the fact that the creators are receiving approximately 90% of the cover price as opposed to the 50-60% they'd be receiving if they went through a distributor--in other words, they're making as much per copy as if it were an $55 book. 
 
I don't expect a small press to be able to compete with the economies of scale available to Image or Dark Horse, let alone Marvel or DC. But an original 100-page color GN from Dark Horse would cost in the $25-30 range, and they aren't getting paid up front! 
 
How do these prices make any sense at all? 
 
Well, as I write this, <i>Elysia</i> is about 75% of the way to funding. Only 112 people have backed packages that concentrate on the comics themselves; about half of the funds come from another 14 buyers who have backed packages that include custom art, original art, Tuckerization, or a full customized story. (This is the big Magilla--at #5000, this one customer constitutes one-third of the funding so far.) The low-end rewards are for digital editions, which come closer to reasonable pricing, at #10 ($15) for the 100-page first chapter. 

Maybe that's the problem? They're pricing the PDF high enough to not completely undercut the possibility of paper sales, but then they have to price the paper versions even higher because of the substantial printing costs, which leads to them leapfrogging themselves out of price competitiveness. But still, it's just too much money."

"event","This is a story I've told orally many times, but it appears I've never written it down.

From 1992 until 2001, I worked for <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20000815213429/http://www.crossover.com/"">Crossover Technologies</a>, a small and never particularly successful games company--well, we did some other projects as well, but our core business was online games. From 1995 to 1997, I was the producer for our first web-based game, <i><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20000901025836/http://www.reinventing.com/"">REINVENTING AMERICA</a></i>. <i>ReUS</i> was a massively multiplayer public policy game built around groups of people trying to influence the Congressional budget process. (Remember when America had a Congressional budget process? Truly, the mid-1990s were a lost golden age.)

<i>Reinventing America</i> was funded by a public policy nonprofit called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markle_Foundation"">The John and Mary Markle Foundation</a>. They were interested in all sorts of ways to harness emerging information technologies for good government/public good projects--one of their big initiatives in the previous year was a study of universal e-mail access. The president of the Markle Foundation at the time was a man named Lloyd Morrisett, a marvelously smart and charming gentleman in his mid-60s, tall, aristocratic--I've joked for years that he looked more like Julius Caesar than any person I've ever met.

The Markle Foundation wasn't really Lloyd's claim to fame, though. 30 years earlier, he had the insight that his 3-year-old daughter might like to watch a funny, genuinely educational tv show, and he cofounded <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Television_Workshop"">Children's Television Workshop</a>.

On the set of CTW's first show, one of the things he was legendary for was his unerring instinct for when the dessert cart was going to show up, and making a beeline for the cookies.

During the period I knew him, he had a sizable office in the Time-Warner Building; behind his desk was a mantel with a few of his many awards and honors. And in the absolute center, a 3"" tall figurine of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_monster"" target=""_blank"">Cookie Monster</a>.

When I moved to New York, it never occurred to me that I would end up working for a muppet. But I did, and it was an honor.

Here's a recent photo of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Morrisett"">Lloyd</a> and his greatest claim to immortality:

* There have been dozens of volumes of Conan stories, but this is the only collection I'm aware of that explicitly covers Howard's whole range of fiction. 
**There have been dozens of volumes of Lovecraftian material; I'm not going to try to list them all.
*** Peter Straub's <i>Poe's Children</i>, published the same year (Poe's bicentennial), is deliberately not a collection of stories in the style of/subject matter of Poe, but instead reflects the ways in which horror has evolved from Poe's roots.

I have not listed the Heinlein tribute <i>Requiem</i> or <i>The Worlds of Jack Williamson: A Centennial Tribute</i>, because they are not fiction collections. (The Heinlein does contain one unfortunate, previously published Larry Niven story.) I am also not listing most collections of stories featuring corporately owned characters (e.g., various superheroes, <i>Star Trek</i>, or <i>Star Wars</i>) or all the Sherlock Holmes collections. I'm also not including sharecroppings <strike>such as the 2 volumes of ""Incomplete Enchanter"" short stories edited by L. Sprague de Camp and Christopher Stasheff in the early 1990s</strike> the multi-volume <i>Man-Kzin Wars</i> series; those seem different in spirit from what I'm looking at. 

ETA: The line between ""tribute to a living writer"" and ""sharecropped"" is really blurry. I'm not sure there's any solid heuristic that would sort <i>Hellbound Hearts</i> or <i>Sandman: Book of Dreams</i> into the ""tribute"" bucket while labeling the de Camps as ""sharecropped"". So I've put the de Camps into the main list. 

I've said before that I seek out tribute albums, because a great tribute album combines several great virtues: enthusiasm, coherence, polysemy, and awareness of the traditions of genius. Most tribute albums fall short of the mark, but the best of them (notably <i>Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye</i>, in honor of Roky Erikson, and <i>I'm Your Fan</i>, in honor of Leonard Cohen) are among my favorite albums of all time. I love the idea."

"event","One of the pleasures of working on NYRSF is our weekly meetings, which are held at the offices of Tor Books in The Historic Flatiron Building^tm. A few months ago, I was walking down the hall and spotted Jim Frenkel, in for one of his quarterly visits from the wilds of Wisconsin, and we fell to talking. At one point, he mentioned that he had known one of his authors since before she was his assistant at Bluejay Books. We both laughed, because that was a <b>long</b> time ago--Bluejay lasted for about 3 years in the early 1980s, oh god, we're all so so old.

Later he mentioned his wife, who is the legendary Joan Vinge. And I had a weird realization that in some part of my brain I still think of Joan as a &quot;new&quot; writer... because she was a hot new writer just as I was starting to read science fiction seriously, just under 40 years ago. The 3 Vs of the 1970s--Joan Vinge, John Varley, and Vonda McIntyre--will forever be in my brain as ""those hot youngsters"" purely by the accident of me discovering them just as their careers took hold. Writers who came into prominence later--the early '80s hotshot whipper-snappers like Connie Willis, Karen Joy Fowler, and the Ace Specials Musketeers of William Gibson, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Lucius Shepard--still have a faint glimmer of ""aren't these guys pretty recent?"" but by the time they came along, my brain had adapted to the idea that new writers were a part of the life of the field.

Not sure if this has any significance beyond ""Wow, memory plays many silly tricks with time."" But, uh, memory plays many silly tricks with time."

"event","A few years ago, I was driving home after my weekly trip to the recycling center. A large Dunkin Donuts iced coffee sat in the cup holder by my right hip, still mostly full. I cleared a small rise leading to an exit ramp and had to brake sharply on the downhill side because there was a surprising line of cars backed up waiting to exit. The coffee cup popped straight up, turned 180 degrees in mid air, and fell, lid-down in the front passenger footwell. 

The lid stayed on. A little coffee leaked out through the straw hole, but otherwise my car remained dry and not-coffee-scented. 

It took me many months to realize why this was so flabbergasting, beyond the general sense of relief that somehow the worst failed to happen. The tight seal between the lid and the cup is a triumph of engineering. Dunkin has engineered the cup so that its servers (they don't use the word ""barrista"") can add ice, sweetner, milk, flavor syrups, and whatever else to the coffee within the cup, put on the lid, and shake the mixture until well-blended. To find such good work in a 3-cent plastic cup that is literally designed to be thrown away is a testament to the fact that the cost of good design is generally negligible. But it was still a wonder to see it in action."

There are two major causes: Many gas stations are still without power, so all of the gas in their tanks is inaccessible; and riverine deliveries to the main local transshipment point (Newburgh, NY, about 60 miles north of Yonkers) have been suspended for several days because of high water on the Hudson. The latter is expected to end tomorrow (Saturday) or early Sunday, but, as it says at the link, ""It's not going to happen overnight, though. It'll take a couple of days."" A third, minor, cause is increased consumption by portable generators and yard equipment, which at least has contributed to hoarding and overbuying. 

<lj user=""supergee""> witnessed some of the lesser appalling gas lines at stations near our house. Another article mentioned a station in White Plains that had a line of cars a mile long waiting, and complaints of waits 2 or 3 hours in Yonkers were common on Twitter today.

(My own experience with lines was limited to seeing a truly epic bus line in midtown Manhattan. It extended at least 2 blocks up Lexington before turning and running along 46th Street most of the way to the Park Avenue overpass--about 1/4 mile.) 

Compared to having one's car or home destroyed, this is still pretty minor stuff. But it's a real problem. Running out of gas is not a problem that one can get around with mere patience or determination (walking to the subway is really not an option), and I worry that <lj user=""nellorat""> will not be able to reach work on Sunday.

"event","Once again, <a href=""http://www.nyrsf.org""><i>NYRSF</i></a> did not win the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine ; <i><a href=""http://www.locusmag.com/"">Locus</a></i> did. I was of course immediately disappointed, but very quickly realized how happy I was for them. Editor-in-chief Liza Groen Trombi, in her acceptance, pointed out that this was the first victory for <i>Locus</i> in which Charles Brown was not on the ballot. Thus, she and managing editor Kirsten Gong-Wong finally have a win all their own, which fills me with delight. This is also <i>Locus's</i> last year of eligibility; a new rule defining Professional Publication for purposes of both Semiprozine and Fanzine were ratified at this year's Worldcon, and under the new definition, <i>Locus</i> is unmistakably not eligible for either category, so if they were ever going to get the separate recognition they deserve, this was the year for it. 

I believe that when one is nominated for an award (that one cares about), one owes the award the courtesy of assuming one might win it. Thus, as I have for the last few years, I wrote an acceptance speech: 

<blockquote>Wow. Thank you all. I have a choice now between being a bit dry or being a complete wreck. So, dry.

I hope you'll forgive me for running on--there are a lot of people who deserve thanks for this, and I've been waiting 15 years to do it.

I have to thank all the people who worked directly on the magazine now: my co-editors David, Kris, and <lj user=""agrumer"">; our webmaster, Alex Donald; and our staff and crew, Jen Gunnels, Ann Crimmins, Eugene Reynolds, <lj user=""drcpunk"">, Heather Masri, A. P. Canavan, Anne Zanoni, M'jit Raindancer-Stahl, and Eugene Surowitz. Thanks to all those who have gone before us. And of course to all of our contributors, too, too many to list. It takes a lot of people to make a monthly magazine.

I'd also like to thank the various members of the Semiprozine reform committee. Thank you also <a href=""http://weightlessbooks.com"">Weightless Books</a>, Gavin Mike & Kelly, for becoming our new home in the ebookosphere; you were the life preserver we so needed. 

Thanks to my father, John, whose bookshelves were my first and best library of sf; and to my brother, Tim, my first fannish model, who would pretend to be unimpressed by all this.

And thanks, above all, to my wife, <lj user=""nellorat"">, and to my co-husband, <lj user=""supergee"">, for understanding exactly how important all this craziness is to me.</blockquote> 

On the bright side, in all of the other categories in which I could have an informed opinion, my preferred choice won.

"event","A ""zero tolerance"" policy and a ""lifetime ban"" are completely separate things. 

""Zero tolerance"" is a type of enforcement--true ""zero tolerance"" means that if you break the rule, you will receive the punishment, no exceptions. ""Lifetime ban"" is a definition of a type punishment that is available for those who punish those who violate the policy. 

A zero-tolerance policy can have many levels of punishment, based on elements such as specific offense (a ""zero-tolerance"" rule against possessing weapons could still have different levels of punishment for carrying a knife vs. carrying a suitcase packed with explosives) or repeat offenses. ""Zero tolerance"" and ""lifetime ban"" aren't synonyms."

I also note that right now I'm buying more DC main-imprint titles than I was before the ""New 52"" relaunch--18, up from 11 in August 2011--so it's quite <i>possible</i> I'll end up getting more Marvels after the relaunch; I just don't think it's likely. DC has actually shown some cleverness in recruiting new writers from the indies (Jeff Lemire, Josh Filakov), from outside comics (China Mieville), and getting good work out of writers who had been away (Paul Levitz, Marv Wolfman). I don't see Marvel doing that; almost all the writers who have been announced so far for Marvel NOW are already working for Marvel. (The one exception so far is screenwriter/comic actor Brian ""Brian from <i>The Sarah Silverman Program</i>""  Poesen for <i>Deadpool</i>, which is a great choice.)

"event","Sixty-nine years ago, the Battle of Kursk had been underway for two weeks; it would last another four. Kursk was the last of the four major battles of the Great Patriotic War, the four years of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Kursk is almost completely absent from the modern Western memory; lacking the cliffhanger drama of the battle of Moscow, the unique horrors of Stalingrad, or the numbing scope of the 3-year siege of Leningrad, Kursk was ""just"" a long summer battle with no clear narrative. Kursk itself was not one of the great industrial cities of USSR, and the purpose of Operation Zitadelle, the Nazi offensive, was simply to take territory around a bulge in the front line, capturing/killing Soviet troops, shortening the front (thus freeing up some troops to send to the west as the US/British invasion became more inevitable),  and giving the Axis a position of strength from which to continue the war on their own terms.

Over a million Soviet soldiers died in the battle, along with 300,000 Axis, and truly staggering amount of war materiel was lost by both sides--twice as many tanks were destroyed in the 6 weeks of Kursk as had been involved in the battle of France three years earlier. Unlike most of the battles of the European war, which were defined by sudden concentrated strikes and sweeping gestures, Kursk was a war of trenches and defense-in-depth, the Nazis throwing their superior tanks and tactics against a vastly larger and well-prepared foe. When the Germans stopped their offensive, they had achieved basically none of their goals, and the Soviets immediately began a counter-offensive that continued until the fall, taking back Orel and Kharkov from the Nazis. The Nazi failure gave the military initiative to the Soviets, who never lost it again.

Paul Carell was a German historian (and ""reformed"" SS official) whose books <i>Hitler Moves East</i> and <i>Scorched Earth</i> were very influential in shaping Western narratives of the Great Patriotic War. He argued that the Axis defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943 represented the end of Nazi hopes of victory. However, he argued, the Soviets were unable to follow up Stalingrad with further successes, and by the late spring, the Axis still had a hope of fighting to a draw. (What the nature of that ""draw"" might be is unclear--by that time, neither Hitler nor Stalin would have been likely to agree to an armistice of any sort.) However, with the failure at Kursk and the success of the Soviet offensive at Kharkov, the outcome of the war was no longer in doubt; the Nazis had irretrievably lost.

That was the end of August, 1943. However, it took another 21 months of fighting before the Soviets captured Berlin and ended the war. Of the 46 months of open warfare between the two great dictatorships, nearly half of it took place after the Third Reich had no feasible hope of doing anything other than losing completely. The invasions of Sicily and Italy; D-Day; Operation Market Garden; the Battle of the Bulge; the V-2; the (second) Warsaw Uprising; the bombing of Dresden--all of these took place during that prolonged collapse. 

That's the true lesson of Kursk: a lot of awful fighting can mask the fact that the battle is already lost, or won. By the <a href=""http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/001705.html"" title=""The people who control institutions care first and foremost about their power within the institution rather than the power of the institution itself"">Iron Law of Institutions</a>, the people in control of the losing side are more willing to fight to the last of their underlings than admit defeat and step down. Even though the war is won, yet the victors can not stop fighting, and there's a lot of damage still to be done."

She was born before Gallipoli, before tanks, before antibiotics, before the US had any immigration laws, in Havana before the communists controlled any country in the world. She lived through, and above, the most genocidal and the most productive century in human history so far, and managed throughout always to believe, sincerely, that things were looking up. 

In late May, when Abuelita was in the hospital, I wanted to send her a get-well bear, and I called the hospital gift shop to arrange it. The woman on the phone asked me the patient's name, and when I said ""Elita Crow"", she exclaimed with delight, ""Oh, Elita! We're all rooting for her!"" That summed her up as well as any sentence could. Everyone was rooting for her because she was rooting for everyone.

From her I learned two lessons: love the things you love without shame or hesitation, and whatever you do, do with energy and joy. Oh, and 500 Rummy. That served me well, too. 

It gives me pleasure, and hope, to think of her, now, smoking with lungs incorruptible, drinking with a liver invulnerable, and laughing, dancing, loving everything and everyone with a heart unceasing and eternal.

I mention this today in memory <a href=""http://tim-maroney.livejournal.com/45789.html"">not just of her</a>, of course. She and <a href=""http://tim.maroney.org/"">Tim</a> had a tempestuous relationship (even more so than she and I did) but I know that the last time they saw each other, they were happy in each others' company as family, really, should be. Let's all be, when we can."

<blockquote>A Gettier problem is any one of a category of thought experiments in contemporary epistemology that seem to repudiate a definition of knowledge as justified true belief (JTB). The category of problem owes its name to a three-page paper published in 1963, by Edmund Gettier, called ""Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?"". In it, Gettier proposed two scenarios where the three criteria (justification, truth, and belief) seemed to be met, but where the majority of readers would not have felt that the result was knowledge due to the element of luck involved.</blockquote>"

<ul>
<li> Here in Orange County the marriage amendment lost, with 80 percent against it and 20 percent in favor of it. In Chapel Hill, where I serve as mayor, the amendment failed even more spectacularly: 86 percent to 14 percent. </li>
<li>While winning eight out of hundred counties may not seem like much, it is important to recognize that the Great Eight ... are also home to what Americans love most about North Carolina. These counties include the cities of Asheville, Pittsboro, Cape Hatteras, Durham, Charlotte, Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Boone.</li>
<li> We need your support to convince the rest of North Carolina that these  issues are important and that equality is the only solution. </li>
</ul> 

All of these swirl around 2 larger points that the writer doesn't make explicitly: 

1. North Carolina is very populous but is one of the least urbanized states--in terms of the percentage of the population who live in urban areas. 
2. No state--not even Mississippi or Massachusetts--is completely ""red"" or ""blue"". 

Minority rights in modern America isn't so much a Northern/Southern or Coastal/Inland issue as it is an urban/rural issue. I have a larger constellation of thoughts about that (broadly speaking, the more one has direct experience of people greatly unlike one's self, the more one is willing to treat them like human beings), and it's worth reminding ourselves of this dynamic."

"event","In much of the world, equities are traded by symbol, not by name. In the West, symbols are usually just strings of letters, sometimes abbreviations of the company name (Microsoft is MSFT, Sirius Radio is SIRI); sometimes they ARE the company name (Yum Brands, the holding company that owns a lot of food brands like Taco Bell, is YUM; 3M is MMM); and sometimes they're just unrelated or downright silly (US Steel is X; Southwest Airlines is LUV).

Unsurprisingly, because the names of the letters of the English alphabet sound alike, traders talking to each other often spell out symbol names--""M as in Mike, S as in Sarah, F as in Frank, T as in Ted""--because making mistakes is really bad. Getting AMN confused with ANN can be a 5000% error.

I realized shortly after taking a job in the equities industry that I really should learn a formal Radio Alphabet (e.g., the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet"">NATO phonetic alphabet</a>), but I had so much else to absorb early on that I dragged my feet around it. About two months into the job, I was walking past the trading desk and I heard one of the traders telling a customer about a trade in symbol FPP, which he then spelled out as ""fuck pussy pussy"".

Within 5 minutes, I had a printout of the NATO alphabet taped to my monitor. I was never going to be at that much of a loss for words."

It shifted to Thursday piecemeal between 1984 and 1990, and then to Wednesday sometime after 1991. I am not sure whether there really was a New Comics Day as early as 1980; if there was, it was probably Friday, in which case 1980 did have 5 NCD in February.

The two novels sold decently well, but not well enough for DAW Books to publish the third novel in the series, focused on the cousin of Hadon, the protagonist of the first two novels.

Since I most still read comics in pamphlets, and then don't re-read or re-buy them in collected form, it's hard for me to tell exactly what meets eligibility. However, I think all of these were published within or had their collected editions in 2011 and are thus valid. 

So, here's my long list. Now I need to figure out how to trim this to 5. [ETA: I misunderstood the eligibility rules, which leads me to make a few additions and deletions. Thanks, <lj user=""stevendj"">.)

<ul>
<li> <i>House of Mystery: Conception</i> (Matthew Sturges and Luca Rossi)</li>
<li> <i>iZombie: uVampire</i> (Chris Robeson and Michael Allard) </li>
<li> <i>Joe the Barbarian</i> (Grant Morrison and Sean Murphy) </li>
<li> <i>King City</i> (Brandon Graham)  </li>
<li> <i>Knight and Squire: For Six</i> (Paul Cornell and Jimmy Broxton) </li>
<li> ""Locke and Key: Open the Moon"" (Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez) </li>
<li> <i>Morning Glories: All Will be Free</i> (Nick Spencer and Joe Eisma)  </li>
<li> <i>Neonomicon</i> (Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows)  </li>
<li> <i>Oglaf</i>, Collected Edition 1 (Trudy Cooper) </li>
<li> <i>Proof: Endangered</i> (Alex Grecian and Riley Rossmo) </li>
<li> <i>Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal vol. 2: The Most Dangerous Game</i> (Zach Weiner)</li>
<li> <i>Secret Six: The Darkest House</i> (Gail Simone and Jim Calafiore) </li>
<li> <i>Unwritten: Leviathan</i> (Mike Carey and Peter Gross) </li>
<li> <i>The Weird World of Jack Staff</i> by Paul Grist</li>
<li> <i>Xombi: The Ninth Castle</i> (John Rozum and Frazier Irving) </li>
</ul> 

Stricken because these both concluded in December 2010 and are thus not eligible, but they're still really good and you should buy the collections: 
<strike>
<ul>
<li> <i>Bulletproof Coffin</i> (David Hine and Shakey Kane) </li></strike>
<strike><li> <i>Taskmaster: Unthinkable</i> (Fred van Lente and Jefte Palo) </li></strike>
</ul>

Almost made the list: <i>Order of the Stick: Snips and Snails and Dragon Tails</I> by Rich Berlew. However, this volume is really a collection of shorter pieces, not a coherent whole, and none of the individual pieces are quite of Hugo caliber by themselves. And I'm really tempted to mention <i>X-Men Legacy</i> #260 by Mike Carey and Khoi Pham (and others), but while it's a lovely, emotionally rich turning point for one of the best characters in the X-universe, it's really just a single chapter in the middle of a very long story, much of its impact depending on not just the stories immediately proceeding it but the 30 years of stories leading up to that. As such, nominating it makes about as much sense on its own as a random chapter from <i>The Sword of the Lictor</i>. 

For next year, definitely expect to see <i>Iron Man 2.0: Who Is Palmer Addley</i> (Nick Spencer and Ariel Olivetti), the first <i>Demon Knights</i> arc and possibly the first <i>I, Vampire</i> arc, the current bifurcated <i>Unwritten</i> storyline, Warren Ellis's six-issue run on <i>Secret Avengers</i> (whatever its collective title ends up being), <i>Casanova: Avaritia</i>, and <i>Locke and Key: Clockworks</i>. And I suspect <i>Journey Into Mystery</i> will get in there, but I'm just starting reading that now. The ""Finder"" short stories in <i>Dark Horse Comics Presents</i> are brilliant; let's see if they turn into a story."

"event","Back in December 2010 I complained: 
<blockquote>The price of my monthly MTA (commuter rail) ticket just jumped 10%. . . . I hate how the Great Recession is slowly (or not-so-slowly) strangling government services, especially the services <strike>I use</strike> that encourage better methods of living, as public transit does.</blockquote>

Another example of that strangulation, about which I've seen very little discussion: The IRS <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employer_transportation_benefits_in_the_United_States"">has a policy</a> whereby you can deduct a monthly amount from your taxable wage if you spend it on commuting expenses. As a wage deduction, this directly reduces your taxable income, so you get a discount on your commuting costs roughly equal to your highest marginal wage tax rate. 

Until 2010, the maximum amount you could deduct for parking was <i>much</i> higher than the maximum amount you could deduct for mass transit: approximately $215/month for parking vs. $120/month for mass transit. In 2010, though, the mass transit benefit was increased to parity with parking, which is, if anything, not going far enough--tax policy should be used to encourage behavior which is less destructive rather than more destructive. 

With the start of 2012, the mass transit benefit cap has dropped back down to $125/month, while the parking benefit increased to $240.

"event","When we moved into Valentine's Castle in the summer of 1992, I had 27 long boxes of comics plus a few boxes of comics magazines--and let me just note that the evening that I carried all 27 boxes from the moving van to my study was the single hardest work I've ever done, because I decided to do it all at once because I was really, really stupid. <lj user=""nellorat""> kept her comics in legal-width (14"") filing cabinet drawers in the basement. (This is actually a really cool method for storing comics; a standard American comic is just under 7"" wide and 10"" tall, so each drawer can hold 2 rows standing side-by-side, like longboxes on drawers. But filing cabinets are heavy and expensive and they take more space than an equivalent volume of boxes.)

That year might have been the last time that I could honestly say our comics were organized. We've been buying comics together for two decades, and the mountain has growed and growed and growed. Last year, we started the process of trying to reclaim my sizable study from the resident pile. It was somewhere around 70 long boxes against two walls of the room when I took a week off work to pull out material to sell and do an initial, partial organization; we pulled about 24 boxes to sell at that point. They're still in the study, but in a separate pile blocking off the least important of my 3 closets-full-of-games and a bookcase of true crime paperbacks. My FLCS is finally going to take them on consignment this month. (That delay is a story in itself--the shop is the second in a relatively new two-store chain owned by two guys. The co-owner and manager of the Manhattan store strongly believes that a full-service comics shop should offer back issues, and after a year of planning they're ready to start selling them.)

Anyway, about a month ago I realized I had 10 vacation days left for this year and can only carry over 5, so I arranged to take the week between Christmas and New Year's to make the final push. Since Saturday, December 24, I have gone through the main comics mountain--now 80 short boxes--at least 3 times, alphabetizing them, pulling another 6.5 long boxes for sale, and setting aside about a third of them for nellorat's determination of what should and can go into the basement. 

We're not yet done. For instance, I still need to catalog the new ""for sale"" items. As n. reviews the ""basement"" comics. many will be kicked back to the mountain, and we will discover still more duplicates to be purged, holdovers from the period where she and I maintained separate comics collections because we maintained separate households. But we're close. 

Mainly I'm exhausted--I've been fighting off a cold the whole time--both n. and <lj user=""supergee""> have gotten it--and there was a lot to do this past week besides comics-wrangle. (I did have to absent myself from a New Years' Eve party because of the cold.) But that is mixed with delight that I managed to get the worst time- and space-consuming parts of the process done before having to return to work. Given that I was wildly guessing about how long it would take, I almost literally can't believe I'm done with what I've done. Yay me.

"event","1037 comics read on 253 different days. That's *up* 9% from 2010, which is the opposite of what I want to happen. A lot of the additional volume was just the natural sprawl of ""event"" titles--the modern superhero summer event generally involves a mini-series, a lot of crossovers in the ongoing books, and a plethora of tie-in miniseries. However, this year I'm mostly steering clear of the X-books and Marvel in particular looks like it will make it easy to avoid their ""event"" books. (Marvel has also canceled, in some cases with no issues published, several major titles I would have enjoyed picking up, such as <i>Alpha Flight</i> and Fred van Lente's kaiju event title.)

Another boost was the nuDC, which briefly increased my net DC buying by about 7 monthly titles and sampled more--I actually bought 25 of the 52 first issues and briefly subscribed to, I believe, 19 of them. However, attrition is culling that--I'm down to 16 already and 2 more are likely to go when their initial writers leave. 

But, mainly, I just buy and read a lot of comics."

"event","So, one day at work I was talking with two of my Ukranian co-workers about our market data feed application. This was the component of our (now discontinued) proprietary trading system that took real-time stock pricing information from an outside provider and digested it for the other components. Because there are so many stocks traded in the US (around 12,000 active on the four main exchanges plus thousands more on the ""bulletin boards"" and ""pink sheets""), the market data server was split into many separate processes, dividing the universe into alphabetical regions. We referred to the resulting six-head process as ""The Hydra"". Apparently, the junior programmer hadn't ever heard this term before and looked, puzzled, first at me and then at the senior programmer, whose grasp of the oddities of English was superior. The senior said ""Ghidra"", and the junior nodded, comprehending. 

And thus did I come to know the origin of the name of one of the great kaiju--<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghidra"">Ghidorah</a>, the three-headed antagonist of Gojira in several movies. Of <b>course</b> the Greek word I know as ""hydra"" would be translated into other languages in different ways. Of course. 

My memory of this event was inspired by <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/fjelstud/the-most-awesomely-inexplicable-nativity-scenes "">this photo-essay of awesomeness</a>, specifically picture #9. 

I started this post on December 25th, but failed to complete it then. However, it's not actually late for another 8 days. A belated Merry Christmas, and may your next year be better than this one."

<blockquote>What's striking is the way AEI doesn't even resort to the usual practice of concocting misleading numbers; it just flat-out lies about what various other peoples' research, like Robert Gordon's work, actually says.</blockquote>

He then goes on to say: 

<blockquote>What I found myself thinking about, however, is the way the inequality debate illustrates some typical features of many debates these days: the way the right has a sort of multi-layer defense in depth, which involves not only denying facts but then, in a pinch, denying the fact that you denied those facts.</blockquote>

Which in turn reminded me of a wonderful bit from the fake news pages of the long-ago National Lampoon, which I paraphrase from memory. This is a quote from the attorney for Sid Vicious, then accused of having stabbed and killed his girlfriend, Nancy Spungeon: 

<blockquote>My client never even knew the victim, and if my client did know the victim, they were never friends, and if my client was her friend, they certainly weren't romantically involved, and if my client was romantically involved with her, they weren't together on the night of her death, and if my client was with her on the night of her death, he certainly didn't stab her, and if my client did stab her, then she was a yak and not entitled to the protections of the law.</blockquote>

"event","Most of the music that I listen to on my way to and from work is downloaded from radio shows--Vin Scelsa's <a href=""http://www.wfuv.org/programs/idiotsdelight"">Idiot's Delight</a>, Sarah Ovenall's Divaville Lounge, and Little Steven's Underground Garage. Vin is ""freeform""--he plays whatever comes to the top of his brain, with an emphasis on rock and folk, but jazz, spoken word, rambling and funny monologues, whatever. 

The other two are much more focused: <a href=""http://divavillelounge.org/"">Divaville Lounge</a> is jazz and pop vocalists, big band, and lounge/exotica, from (as she says) ""Tin Pan Alley to the Swing Era"". The Underground Garage is, as the name says, garage rock from the days of rock and roll to the present. 

I wasn't surprised when two of the shows (Idiot's Delight and Underground Garage) had tributes to September 11th. More surprising back in June was that both Sarah and Little Steven did tribute shows to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Clemons"">Clarence Clemons</a>. Now, of course, Little Steven was Clemons's friend and bandmate for 40 years, so it would have been more surprising if he hadn't done a memorial show; but Sarah's tribute--two hours of saxaphone-heavy jazz--was quite unexpected and inspired. 

Even that, though, didn't prepare me for both Divaville Lounge and Underground Garage, this Sunday just past, to do tributes to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_marx#Mustache.2C_eyebrows_and_walk"">Groucho Marx</a>.

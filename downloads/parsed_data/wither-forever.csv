"event","With tattered I will fly and fall again,
My strength has grown too weak to take flight,
and here I am searching for the light,
With tattered wings I cant live the dream,
and my blood keeps flowing like a racing stream,
I wish for that day,
Flying with my angel among the heavens,
but I have grown to be someone i hate,
and I'm a person who has lost all hope in fate,
So Tongiht I stand alone under a starry sky,
with these shattered things,
yes here I am,
...With Tattered Wings


one of my favorite writings."

"event","I hate the realization i get when i look in your eyes,
the thought of being alone,
i can define lonliness,
it is what makes you cry what makes you hurt and what makes you bleed,
lonliness is longing for a single thing that you need.

theres no force in this world stronger than love,
i may not be able to define that,
but what else could it be,
when every time you see someone they make you smile and cry at the same time.
see what i have made myself into. 
im weak and wounded as tears fall.
helpless as can be.

"event","ok so my whole day started with babysitting jack. got payed 50 bucks. already had 20. makes 70. me and chris went to the train station. bouhght 4.25 ticket. left me with $65.75. got to philly. went to burger king for dinner. left me with like $61 or so. got to the TLA went in. bought Atreyu hoodie, Underoath shirt, and underoath cd. left me with about 8 bucks. imidiatly went up front and remained up front for the whole show. 

Underoath started out. they were awesome. haha its kinda weird of all the members the keyboardist was the craziest. he headbanged non stop for the whole set. i got to sing in the mike twice for when the sun sleeps. that was cool.

next was darkest hour. bass drum mike was messed up so while fixing that the underoath guitaridst did a striptease. that was funny. then darkest hour came on. they were pretty good. their van got robbed in montreal which fuckign sucks. got ther cellys stolen along with $12,000. so i gave them 5 bucks to their little charity fund at their merch table at the end of the show.

god forbid came on. they were good but at that point i just wanted Atreyu to come on.

Atreyu came on. was fucking amazing. they were all wearing a little makeup it was hot. i sang almost every lyric for all the songs. not the new one. they played one new song called ""right side of the bed"" was really good.

after the show me and chris realized we had an hour to kill before my mom picked us up.so we went to johnny rockets and i has water and he had a shake or soemthing and fries, i ate a few. then we walked back in front of the TLA to wait for my mom. i noticed some of the band members there so i went over and talked a little. first i saw Alex (lead singer of Atreyu) i was liek good show man. hes liek thanks i appreciate it. then i saw Brandon (drummer/singer) and i talked to him. i said nice show hes liek thanks. then he said ""thanks man, i saw you rocking out right up front man"" i was liek yeah you guys are my favorite band. he was like wow thats the coolest thing anyones ever told me. then i talked to him about when the new cds coming out and shit. then i hugged him and walked off.

after that a guy aproached us and told us this whole story about how him and his sister got robbed nd need money and shit and i gave him a dollar and chris gave him all his change. and he walked off and chris was like dude we just gave money to a crackhead. i was liek, well we are helping someone out right. then we were liek hey a payphone lets call mom then we realize we gave all our change to the guy. so we walked a littl and speaking of crackhead i got threatened by one and  then as we were leazing we say the cops padding him down. then we came home. and here i am."

"event","i'm bored so i'm gonna do a horror movie review on the past few days which i'v watched nothing but horror movies:

Nightmare on Elm Street: i'd give this movie about 3 and a half stars. it was ok. didnt live up to what i thought it would. it probly wouldnt have been as good as it was if not for the killing of the first girl. it was pretty intense. if you  are out looking for movies and havnt seen this, it would be an ok movie to rent.

Texas Chainsaw Massacre: i'd give this about one star for effort. not enough plot. too many people die in to short a period of time. and the fucking cripple ruins the movie. although he does add some comic relief. if your looking for a bit of bad horror and a few laughs i guess you could watch it.

Psyco (remake): this movie i would give probly 4 stars. it was a good movie. it doesnt all make full sense till the end but its still a worth while flick. i am gonna have to see the original to make full judgement.

Halloween: i had already seen it but i watched it last night to refresh my mind before watching the 2nd one for the first time. i give it 5 stars. its old school so there isnt as much blood but its not nearly as predictable as modern horror flicks. in my mind Michael Myers is the best killer of them all. if you havnt seen this movie, see it.

Halloween 2: 5 stars for this one. good movie. i'd say this was was as good if not better than the first one. Michael pulled out some new tricks when it came to killing in this movie. wasnt just the old butcher knife. but you wouldnt understand this one if you havnt seen the first one. so see that and then see this.

From Hell: definatly five stars. great movie. plenty of blood for my taste. johnny did a great job in this movie. i dont think it would have been as good without him cuz he acted that part exceptionally well. i definatly recomend this movie.

thats it for today bye."

"event","""So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. Michelangelo, you know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works, right? But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling; seen that. If I ask you about women, you'd probably give me a syllabus about your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You're a tough kid. And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right, ""once more unto the breach dear friends."" But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you. Who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in the hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes, that the terms ""visiting hours"" don't apply to you. You don't know about real loss, 'cause it only occurs when you've loved something more than you love yourself. And I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much. And look at you... I don't see an intelligent, confident man... I see a cocky, scared shitless kid. But you're a genius Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you. But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine, and you ripped my fucking life apart. You're an orphan right? You think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are, because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you? Personally... I don't give a shit about all that, because you know what, I can't learn anything from you, I can't read in some fuckin' book. Unless you want to talk about you, who you are. Then I'm fascinated. I'm in. But you don't want to do that do you sport? You're terrified of what you might say. Your move, chief.""

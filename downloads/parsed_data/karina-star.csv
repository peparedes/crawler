"event","OK i'm stressed the fuck out... like seriously... and yea I haven't been on this for a while.. i've been busy.. I guess i'll start off with some good news so I can pour out my stress. 

Sometime in June I went to an audition for a girl group.  I wasn't even gonna go cause i'm like na I won't get it.. but I said fuck it.. I could use the auditioning experience cause I get so damn nervous.  I did get nervous but I didn't get as bad as I did in previous auditions.  Anyway.. my best friend <b>Jessica,</b> and my <b>boo</b> came with me and anxiously waited as well.  Turns out, I made it! It's three girls in the group.  Well one of them ain't there no more b/c she couldn't make one of the rehearsals for a sort of stupid reason that ""she doesn't take the train,"" and we need someone who's gonna be there.. we can't have someone not make important meeetings for things like that.  Me and the other girl do what we gotta do.. so we need another girl right now.  We been working on our voice and listenin to tracks.. gonna start workin on that.. i'll keep ya updated on that... but i'm excited.. and no matter what happens.. I thank God for the experience.  

What else is good? Ofcourse my baby!!  We made 5 months.. it's a record for him lol his longest relationship before this one was 2 months.  We're doing good.. see eachother a lot.  He took me to the Destiny's Child's last concert and it was so hottt!  Amerie and Mario also performed, it was great!  I never been to something so big like that, and it was good to see that.. since i'm in a group lol.  Those girls are so talented and have amazing voices.. ahhh! I looove musiccc!!! Ok ok.  This summer I've been trying to have fun (my stress starts from this topic.. but hol' on.. lemme finish the good lol) and i've gotten to go to the beach a few times.  I have a TAN but some people don't notice cuz they haven't seen my butt n boobies lol.  Anyway one of the times I went with some friends and Peter.  I never gone to a beach/pool with a boyfriend so it was pretty cool lol I had a lovely time!  We also went to Six Flags and got on the new ride, KingdaKa- which was quick but crazy.  We went to Dorney Park recently with a friend of his and his girl.  It was really cool, ive been havin a great time.  Well except for the whole weirdo scary guy following us on our way home in the highway... had to call 911.. it was scary guys.. we'd speed up change lanes and he'd do the same.. he got close few times like he was trying to hit us... and it kept on for a long time too until finally he went another way and the cops caught up to us.. ALL LATE and shit wtf.  Anyway the license plate our friend gave them didn't come up in the system so maybe he got a # or letter wrong which sucks... but we're glad we're ok.  That was soooo weird and creepy... ok next-

So since the summer here only truly lasts like 2 months.. i've been trying to go out and enjoy the weather.. but you know.. people my age (20s and 21s lol) like to hang out later @ night.. just because.. or because they work.  So I get home late.. but not even too late.. like from 10-12 for the most part.. and sometimes its from work.  Anyway.. EVERYTIME I go out.. I get a call around 8 just bitching at me!  My mother is the one calling.. now I know you care and worry but yo.. let me live.  My parents don't trust me, and it's like I haven't done shit for them not to.. I mean sure I kept things from them or lied here n there about shit.. but honestly.. who doesn't with their parents?  We need SOME kind of privacy.  MAYBE if they trusted me more I wouldn't have to fucking lie to them.. or if they was cool enough too b/c they old fashioned about shit and this is NOT Dominican Republic either.  Sorry, but maybe you shouldn't have moved here b/c things are different.  Not to mention we live in NYC- the city that never sleeps!  They make me feel like shit when I go out.. like i'm this bad person, and call me names.  I don't be in the STREET n shit, smoking, doing drugs, doing guys!  Yo, i'm a decent ass good girl wtf.  I do LEGIT shit like go to friends house to just CHILL or go out like to eat, movies and such.  I don't like being home cause i'm not HAPPY home.  Yea I love my family but they stress me the fuck out.. that's why I broke out in pimples like never before a few months ago.. cause of my parents!  Anyway my point of all of this is that I need to get out of here.. worst comes to worst, i'll have to rent out a room.. but what I really wanna do is get a place and share it with Jessica and maybe one other person so it'll come out cheaper for all. 

I know my parents care about me, but they not lookin at things from my point of view.. and they don't try to just understand or listen to me that i'm not doing nothing bad that they need to trust my judgement.  I wish they'd trust me and that I don't be choosing to do stupid shit.  I wanna live my life man.. I dont know if i'ma die tomorrow (wish I could!).  But damn man i'm a free spirit, I don't wanna be no caged bird!  Talkin' about i can't be going out in the weekdays, only weekends.. but its the SUMMER and if I don't work the next day or even if I do.. let me enjoy myself man!  I'm not 50.. I don't have a damn career OR kids! What am I gonna be home for?? And even still when i go out on weekends its a fuckin problem!  I'm turnin 21 next month yo.. get off it!! OK this is longer than I thought.. just venting... but yea.. if anyone needs a roomie.. i'll be real easy to get along with lol  I go to school, work, sing, so I won't be there all day all the time and shit lol  Just need internet access thats all.. not even a tv! Ahh ok.. who am I kidding i'm not gonna find someone here lol SO ANYWAY

Last good news...

I bought the Alicia Keys ""Songs in A minor"" sheet book and i'ma practice with that.  Takes me sometime cuz i'm not a prob but i'm learning ""Never felt this way"" first.. it's the shortest one lol AHhh!! Got the first page down! Sorta.. lemme go practice...

Ok guys... thanks for listening (if you did) I know I been gone for a minute! 

Love yous though!"

Remember how I had a valentine this year?  Well it was on a friendly tip, but after that day we started talking.  His name is Peter, and I had met him last semester.  We was friends back then only, cause I was with D, and I didn't look at him in that way, and vice versa.  We used to have mad fun in school though, buggin out with our other friends and shit on what I called ""FUNDAY"" lol.  After Valentine's though, we started talking and liking eachother. After about a month though, we made it official (3/13/05).  So yes guys, i'm not <b>single</b> anymore! LOL.  We will have two months May 13th and things are going good.  I'm sooo happy to be with my baby!!  I know I know, it's kinda sickening all this luvy duvy shit, but hey!  What can ya do? NOTHING ;) lol

Yesterday we met up after work and chilled w/ our friend Alexis and a girl he's talking to.  We ate some bangin cake around Soho or something.. I got no clue where the hell we was at lol.  After that we went to play pool in which my baby sucked at, but he was cute anyway! LOL.  With luck he made some in lol.  I'm not that good at it either, but i'm good enough! After that we went to the girls building (Rebecca) to take her home.. but we kinda chilled in her staircase.. well each couple on a different floor. lmao.  And thaz all I got to say about that!  Anyway, baby just got a LJ name, so you can read him up in '05 lol.. <lj user=""buttiherenz""> funny story behind the name lol.

As for <b>school</b>.. I could def be doing better.. i'm such an asshole I swear.  I dropped Macroeconomics cause I just couldn't take it.. that professor was terrible.. plus me being late to the class didn't help.. but he was terrible anyway.. I was so confused.. so many people dropped that class.. it was ridiculous.  I'ma try to  not let my parents find out :-\ Cause my pops paid for it and I felt really bad, but I didn't want that grade to fuck up my GPA, and I KNEW I was failing.  Anyway as for <b>modeling</b>, I haven't had time to pursue it much cause I've been either working or in school, but i'm slowly trying to get back into it.  On my 2nd day at work.. by the way i'm working at Office Depot now.. one of the guys there asked me what I was doing there.. that I should be making money as a model lol.  It was funny, but reminded me that I should go for what I wanna go for.. which includes my <b>singing</b>.. I havent been practicin much, so I gotta get back to it as well.  I gotta pay some bills and then start saving up so I can take lessons with this guy thats really good.  Also, i'ma start recording soon some stuff.. slowly buildin up and shit.. it's a process...

Also, I finally saw ma baby Nikki AKA <lj user=""sharemyworld""> the other day and she got to meet Peter, and I got to meet her man too!  What a fun day!! *kisses*  Gotta chill again soon! 

Anyway I guess that's all for now.. i'm on spring break and it sucks cause I have SHIT to do.. plus my lil bro is on break too so it's not like I get to chill by myself at home which is always fun.  Man I need to get drunk at least ONE day outta this damn break! lol Gotta bring a lil piece of cancoon here!  A lil piece of florida!  LOL.  Aight .. here's pics of me and my baby, and some with Nikki:

"event","OMG SMarie lol you're the only one wonderin where the hell i been!  Shit it's been a while.. I've been sooo busy.. barely have time for myself!  Well new years.. I left to florida which is why I didnt write then... I was there til the 11th of Jan.. it was ok nothing big happened.  Decent lil gettway.  The day before I come back.. my friend Steven tells me they're hiring at the staples he workin in.. that they need a cashier.. so when I come back here I go to the interview and BAM have the job lol.  I had about a week before I started school when I started working.  Now.. i'm in both school AND working!  On mondays & wedsdays i'm in school til 12:15.. then I go in work at 2... fri-sun work.. and I be gettin home late on the weekdays... 9 something sometimes 10.  Sat I work 9-6, and Sun 12-5.  So as you can see I dont have a DAY for myself.  It's nuts. 

But I gotta get paid please!  I'm pimpin itttttt *hyper* lolol ok maybe not but I can actually pay my bills now.. and buy some stuff for me.. and save some money.. and most importantly take Zuky for a vet checkup.. wanna check few things out with her right now that aint too right.  Dont remember if I mentioned it but Zuky lives with Dwight now b/c the other lady couldnt take care of her anymore.. so she's been with Dwight for some time now.  I just wanna leave here there rather than moving her from house to house anymore.  She's already used to her new family.  I appreciate it soo much that they are taking care of her.

As for me and Dwight.. we're not together anymore.  We were just havin too many probs and I guess it's just not meant to be.. at least not right now.  I cried when it happened.. but to tell you the truth after that.. I was fine.. I was totally fine with it.  I guess cause I was already expecting it.  Right now i'm just gonna enjoy myself.. and go with the flow.  Of course i'll never forget him.. and i'll be here for him.. in fact I gotta see him on Thursday cause we taking zuky for the checkup.. so I hope things wont be TOO akward. 

HAPPY VALENTINES DAY GUYS!! I actually got a valentine.. whoa!  lol.  So me and my valentine and willie and his girl went out yesterday.  I drove to New Roc City and we ate Applebees!  It was yummy.. and we had fun.  As for the official valentine's day.. I wont get to see him cuz when i'm in school he workin, and then after that i'm workin so eh.  And omg I finally bought the boots i've been want!  I'll prob post a pic soon of me in my PIMP BOOTS! lolol.  Well.. I guess that's that for a ""quick"" update... ima try to update more often please! love yas! *muahz*"

"event","I guess after so many times of wishing death upon myself.. I consider myself to be depressed.  This is something I havent really spoken about on here.. and don't get worried.. I dont THINK i'll try anything.  I don't wanna die... but sometimes I just wish I really was dead. I wish it a lot too.  So I guess this is why i'm a little scared a/b my trip to Florida. Cause i've been wishin death upon myself a lot.. what if this is it?  I mean yea i'm sure nothing will happen, but you never know right?  

It's just.. i'm so tired of dissapointing people.. i'm tired of people not being happy with me.  My faults are reminded to me all the time and it brings me down even more.  With all these friends, family, and even boyfriend around me, I still feel ALONE.  I know my bf is dissapointed and upset cause I still havent changed much on my responsibility and time issues, and I dont like dissapointing people, but its hard to change.  When people keep being unhappy with you, it doesnt motivate you.. it brings you down even more.  It's not only that they're unhappy, but the way the act towards you, like with anger or ""tired of shit.""   They have a right to feel the way they do, I know this.. I just wish I could run away from everything and start fresh. 

THIS JUST IN- I apologized to D and told him I loved him and just want us to be happy and miss eachother while i'm at florida. (didnt help much tho lol)

Ok, this was supposed to be a short post.. trust me I have WAY too much shit in my mind about this topic though.. so I cant keep on right now.. but I hope I have a safe trip.."

Aight.. a lot of things have happened since the last time I wrote.. so I'ma try to remember it all.. and try to keep it short.  Let's see.. ok well for one thing me and <b>Dwight</b> are back together.  We got back a couple of weeks ago.  He admitted that he missed me and wanted to give us another try.  At first I was like eh.. just wanted to be friends and with time.. so we did that for a short time and then he asked me out one night.  I said yes but wasn't sure at first if I should have.. but then I was fine about it (I dont regret it at all).  He's being a good boy, and we're doing good for the most part.. sometimes I need to be a good girl though lol.. we have our lil things here and there but so does everybody right =p  I love him very much and although he was here only a few hours ago, I miss him already lol.  He's working on getting his GED now so that he can move up.. i'm proud of him.. I know he'll pass, he's very smart.  And I know we'll be ok =)  Love youuu babess!

I had two other <b>shoots</b> after the last one with another photographer.  She's really good!  I only got a few pics from the first one I did with her.. i'm still waiting on the second one, and also a lot more from the first.  Also thanks to my baby <lj user=""sharemyworld""> (Nikki) for everything she's done for me!  She called me up to do a fashion show on October 22nd, and there I met <lj user=""_butterflies""> (Jaz), Nikki's friend.  We had fun there bugging out.. even though we didn't really like our crazy halloween-themed makeup.      I miss my Nikki!  Havent seen her for a bit.. infact I think that was the last time I saw her :( Niiikkii I lob ju! lol 

Ah yes can't forget about my trip to <b>Syracuse</b> to visit my babies <b>Groana</b>, and <b>Melissa</b>.  Saw my friend Dayanna as well from high school weee.  It was me, Balbi, and Willie who went out there, Willie drove.. it was hillarious the drive over there.  I tried getting truck drives to honk at us *truck horn arm movement* and only one did it.. he was the man.. I made up a song about it lol ""Are you a cool trucker duuudeee? Are you a cool trucker duuuude?? *arm movement*  *truck honk*  *Gasp* He's a cool trucker duuude!! He's a cool trucker duuude!!"" rofl. Anyway in the middle of fuckin nowhere we exited, and willie pissed by some bushes at a Motel.. then as we drove me and Balbi couldn't hold our piss no more so we exited again..a nd peed by the side of some deserted fuckin road lolol we was dyin!  Anyway we went on a thursday, came back on that sunday.. had so much funn with my babies!!  We partied and drank.. but I didn't get fucked up like that or nothing.

"event","<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v457/karina_star/Karishoot2.jpg"" align=""left""> Well there's one photo from my <b>photoshoot</b>.  Being that it was my first time, they're not the best pics.  But I guess the only way i'll learn is with time and experience :)  Hopefully my next shoot will be better.  I just gotta losen up, and be more confident.  A guy from school hooked me up with a photographer he knows.  He showed me some of her work and it was pretty interesting so I told him to give her my email so she could contact me.  She said she would email me tomorrow and let me know her schedule.. she also said that she could do better than the photographer that took these shoots.  And I don't blame her.. she said she's not cocky but confident lol  Anyway from her work I did like it.. she said she is very excited because she got a stylist, makeup artist, and hair stylist now.  So I can't wait to see what happens with this one.  I'm also waiting to see if they call me back for a stock photography shoot.  Slowly but surely i'm tryina get out there.  I wanna try to find more paying jobs tho b/c I really need the money.  If it doesn't work out then i'ma have to look for a boring job :(  So hopefully this will go through. 

I do feel i've improved on my <b>singing</b>, so i'm glad about that but I know I got a lot to work on still.  Monday i'm going to record at <b>D</b>'s and work on some music with him and I can't wait.  I wonder if things will be akward.. I just wanna go there and really concentrate on my music.  I've been doing fine without him.. like sometimes I miss him but for the most part I accept what happened.  If and when we get back, I want him to have gotten his life together cause if not, we'll end up the same way we are now.  I know he misses me too, but I guess right now is not the time.

A couple of <b>guys</b> are interested in me right now and have asked me out to the movies, or dinner and maybe i'll go.  I told them I don't got money and they offered to pay but I don't like that.. I like being able to pay for myself and all.. i'm thinkin I might as well go and have some fun?  <b>What do you guys think?</b>  I'm not interested in them in that way though, just want friendship.  I haven't met the guy that makes me go WOW! lol.  Sometimes I feel a lil <b>lonely</b>.. wanting affection and shit.. I hate it lol I be missing the whole hugging, kissing, otherstuffs-ing!  BAh enough of that!

Saw my niece today yay!  She's one month now.. she's a lil more attentive.. I sang to her when she was starting to cry and she calmed down and listened and was all like =o lol.  Heyyy five days til I go visit my friends @ Syracuse.. I can't wait!!  I miss my friendss!  I'm going with Willie and Balbi... Willie was able to get the car for the trip so we'll drive out there.  Gotta ask Dad if I can borrow the airbed.  I'm thinkin of tellin mom that Willie is gonna drive us but stay at his friends apt in Syracuse, n tell her that we'll tell dad i'm goin by bus.. OR just tell mom Willie is drivin me and Balbi to the bus staion lol  I dunno... Anywayyyy!!!

I feel like a lot of people are there for me... I have fun in school with all my friends, even friends i just met this semester.  And also, theres a # of guys that are interested in me.  It's very flattering really.. too bad the feelings not mutual though.. I mean sometimes I feel like I might be sorta interested in some of em, but then it's like neh.. singleness yayy!  I mean don't get me wrong if I was to meet someone who made my heart jump then I would go for it.  Righ now i'm just concentrating on me, and feeling ok about everything. :)

Love her! :)  I appreciate her helpin me out with all this stuff that i'm tryina get into (modelin).  She took me downtown to do this makeup artist thingie.. so we could be demonstration models and get paid.  The artists basically tried 4 different looks on the models.  We basically got paid for sittin there gettin our makeup done.  It was very interesting and I had fun.  I'm also gonna go to this place so I can do a stock photography shoot n get paid for that. yay!

These past days we've been going back and forth.. Sometimes I would tell him to forget about it cause he just seemed too busy and like he couldn't really put his part, other times I would tell him that I missed him.. and I knew I didn't wanna let things go.  But now I just have no other choice.  I told him last night that no matter how much I knew I would hurt, that I just didn't wanna keep stressing him about this.. that I want him to be happy and all.  He said I wasn't stressing him that the situation was.. but he kept on about how i'm always negative about things.  That when he came to me telling me how he felt I was negative b/c I had already started mentioning things.. but I mentioned these things b/c they were concerns I had of things that were'nt being done before.&nbsp; Now he says that <i>I</i>made the choice, like it's what I wanted and I hate that b/c it's obviously not but what am I supposed to do.. he can't give his part as much right now, he says things that it's just like pushing me to think he's not really into this right now.  He <i>says </i>that he had told me before how he felt and all, and that I don't trust his word.. but it's not that.. It's just words are words, and yea I believe him, but I want to see action.. and I guess he doesn't wanna have to show action.. he wants me to just trust his words.  I dunno I could be wrong and what not, but I guess that's that.&nbsp; I wish he would fuckin just think about shit and come back maybe differently so we could work things out, but I know it wont happen.  He says that i'm saying one thing and doing the contrary.. like I <i>wanted </i>this shit.. cause my friends know how I fuckin feel about him.  Man i'm so frustrated.  I really feel there has been a lot of <b>miscomunication </b>between the both of us.. cuz its like we both wanna work on it.. but somehow we keep goin back and forth, and apperantly we're not gonna be workin on it.. So I guess i'm just gonna have to move on :(.  Thankfully that one line in Jessica's song is keeping me somewhat at ease lol (well i'm not really laughin) ""And when the love is dead... i'm loving angels instead.""  Again guys, <b>love sucks</b> this way.. and I know some people don't understand my situation.. think I should just let it go.. but it ain't that easy.. and I guess in the end, i'll do what makes me happy...


Movin on.. I know some of you have been waitin for the club pics so guess i'll show ya that next.. I had fun, but I think i'm done with clubbing for now.  My friends are going back to college, and besides.. clubbing too much like that aint for me.. once in a blue yea.. and I would prefer to go with a boyfriend too when I go.  So looks like I wont be havin either or!  Gotta find new things to do now.. If you wanna see the original pic of me n D, its there..

"event","Well.. for those who don't know... I LOOOOVEE Forest Gump.. it's like my favorite!  So today I finally went to try out <b>Bubba Gump Shrimp Co</b> in 44th St n Broadway.  I went with my friends <b>Melissa, Groana, Jhanna, Willie, and Lorenzo</b>.  It was so much fun, what a bug-out!  Instead of waving or calling the waitresses, there was a blue license plate that said ""RUN FOREST RUN"" and if you flipped it, a red one underneath that said ""STOP FOREST STOP.""  When you flipped it to the red one somebody would come to the table to see what we needed.  So funny!  The food was good, but pricy too!  I had a BBQ Cheeseburger.. and all of us got burgers and I had said ""well done please"" and it wasn't.  I mean to me it doesn't taste BAD or anything, but seeing the redness makes me lose my appetite.. so it was a lil red and I flipped the sign and said I had wanted it well done so they kindly made me another one.. and I realized that they just don't know what WELL DONE fuckin means!! Jeez lolo.  Anyway after that we bugged out some more... walked around, went to Hello kitty store and then to Virgin, then finally decided to go home.  Willie offered to drive us home but Melissa took the 1 train :(  Then Groana wanted to just take the train straight home.. so he ended up taking me and Jhanna home. 

I appreciated it so much because I was a lil scared of taking the bus so late and walking home!  Man, <b>Willie</b> is the best!  He's my best guy friend and it's funny cause I met him i guess maybe almost 2 years ago but we've become sooo close.  *Forrest Gump Accent* ""He's my most speshal fri-end!  We are like peas and carrots!"" lol. 

As for <b>D</b>, I dunno whats gonna happen really.. like i wanna be with him, and he wants to be with me but it's like he is doing all these things and I just feel he doesn't have time for me.  I don't feel like he's there 100% or willing to be there like that right now just because he has his own things going on right now.  It's not like I want him to stop doing things because i'm so proud of him, but I wish he could make time for me or sacrafice a bit for me sometimes like he does for others.  But hey, I don't want him to do anything he dont wanna do.  I just don't wanna be here on the side waiting until he has TIME for me.  It hurts!  I dunno what to do.. I mean this is just how I feel i'm sure he might think different, maybe i'm wrong?  How frustrating!  I don't want to make it seem like he's a bad person or anything cause he's such a great person and all..  *sigh*  Maybe I gotta try to get over him?  I dont knowwww!! I dont knowwww!! *sigh*

Here we see..two pairs of sneakers same style different colors, a black LOW shirt that i'll wear if I grow the freakin balls (or buy some freakin boobie tape! lol shit im paranoid), a black and pink short skirt, and no thats not a panty, its a bikini bottom since I bought a white top the other day w/ a bottom i wasn't feelin much, pair of corduroy (sp?) pants, AND lastly, a book with a whole bunch of sheet music.  I bought all this on west 8th street, the clothes at Joyce Leslie, and the book Barnes n Noble.  Since my job is right there I decided to prank my coworkers.. buahah!! I called and said that I had 3 dogs I wanted to bring in for a wash.. a standard poodle, a german shepard, and a rottweiler.. and the thing is i called like 15 min before the last wash started cause I knew they would be like got damnit! buahaha lol so then I showed up and said in my fake old lady voice:

Hi I called about my three dogs getting washed, can you guys still do them!

Buahaha!! They was like ""Karinaaaaa!! you ass!"" lol  Just as I thought they was all like ""fuck someones bringing 3 dogs to get washed"" haha!!

Anyway tomorrow i'm gonna attend a singing class to see if I like it.. that's why I bought the sheet music book.. i'm nervous though I think i'm so gonna fuck up in front of those people.. I dunno what level they are at with their singing.  I guess i'll try my best.. I just hope the music in the book isnt too confusing to sing along to!  Hey a friend of mine (guy) said I would be a queen in a guys life.. that I got it all.. I wasn't expecting that and it made me feel a lil special.  I dunno how to take compliments really.. but I appreciate being appreciated I guess? lol ok i'm rambling.. I think its time I go to bed!

"event","Yes, yes, I know you can't see the pic I put up in my previous entry.. stupid yahoo lol  <b>Anyone know where I can store some pics</b> that I can put up here?  I don't think I can put it on my page cuz of the bandwith and i'm being hosted it's not like mine and all.  

Anyway so me and D have been talkin ok recently, really miss eachother and kinda wanna make it work.  I'm sure ppl think stuff, but they don't know what we been through like that, and our situation and all.. it's my life ya know?  I wanna do what makes me happy.  If me and him don't work out then it wont happen cause it's not meant to be.  If we do, then it is.. I don't know that.. nobody does so oh well..

So D has never got drunk before (he's such a good boy! lol) and like we had been talkin a/b getting druk together one day.  I don't drink like that but i've drank before.  So we decide hey let's do it.  Today I went over and we bought a 6pack of coronita extras.  I was gonna go record but his stupid studio program crap (ProTools) wasnt working.  Anyway so we drank the beer, 3 each.. well he had some of my last one.  It didn't do SHIT to me, and since he never drank like that PLUS he didn't eat all freakin day, it did a lil somethin to him.  He wasnt like FUCKED UP like that, but he felt funny and weird.. vision crappy and all.  It was funny.. we ended up doin other stuff... dot dot dot

But yea before I left he wasnt feelin too good.. dizzy and headache.  I felt horriblee!! I felt so bad and still do cause he feels like shit still.  I kept apologizing and he said it was ok.. but it's like aww he's such a good boy and he did this more for me and now he feels sick!  He jus told me he threw up!  Not good.. I know he dont wanna drink w/ me again probably lol and I don't blame him.. but next time (if there is one) he gotta freakin eat.. oh yea and drink the beer SLOW cuz he freakin gulped them shits.  Overall I had a real nice time with him, I had missed him lots.. August 15th we woulda had four years. I went clubbin on that Sunday but I saw him after that nite and we talked and all.  We'll see how it goes.

School is starting soon *CRY* noooo!!  *sigh*  All i'm looking forward too righ now is some private singing lessons.. I can't wait damnit.. i'ma get so much better.. I gotta keep practicing and all!  I'm telling you singing is not as easy as it looks.. but i'm keepin my head up to the starssss!!"

<b>[Edit]8/18- Ok got an account at photobucket.com thanks <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/smarielovely"" target=""_blank"">smarielovely</a>[/Edit]</b>

So that was me at the club the other nite.  I had so much fun!  Me and Groana went ballin status cause mom lent me the car lol.  I saw couple of friends there so we chilled and danced, and just bugged out.  We're gonna go again next Sunday.. hey free fun!

Anyway, I was gonna have my first official photoshoot on tuesday, but the photographer couldnt do it so we'll see when it can be done.  I saw D the other day and it was pretty cool.. I had missed him so much I was real happy to see him and we had a good time and all.  I guess I realized that I like have to try and get over him.. I mean he says that hopefully soon we can try it again.. but I doubt it cause he's been so busy.  My friend records at D's (he has studio equipment and a booth) like everday cause he needs to finish a Demo.  So D doesn't even have time for himself, not that he minds.  But I kinda feel like this was a big part of us not being together, and it makes me feel like second to it.  I understand he gotta do what he gotta do and i'm proud of him, but I wish he had made some time for me too.  I can't be waiting here for him to have time for me, that's like so fucked up. I shouldn't be second to things like that, at least thats how I feel about it *shrug*.   I guess I just feel like I wasn't important to the point that he was ok with losing me for it.  I dunno sounds weird but anyway...

Tomorrow i'm going to the mall with Growy and Jhanna, hopefully I wont get lost driving over there.. Jhanna says she knows so lol we goin to Jersey.. I cant wait to have some delicioius PANDA EXPRESS!! MmmMM!! I gotta buy the gift for the babyshower on saturday.. my bro is havin a baby due next month.. a girl.  Can't believe i'm gonna be an aunt!! Omg! Time is flyin by!! I wish I was 10 again lol no worries man.  Her name is gonna be Gianna. :)  I guess it hasn't truly hit me until she's born.  Anyway, can't wait til Sunday!  Get my mind off shit.. have a good time.. maybe meet the man of my dreams! lol. Also, school is starting.. paid my bill today! Boooo!! I hope I do good this semester! Ok til next time..."

"event","Well.. I had another lj name.. but nothing much was good with it.. Decided to start anew! So here I am..

A litle over a month ago, me and Dwight broke up.  We would of had 4 years August 15.  I'm still dealing with the breakup.. trying to get over him and all.. but everything reminds me of him.  He was my first love.. first everything.  and I was his.  We didn't have huge problems or nothing, just certain things we had to work out, or change.. things that werent being completely done.  I really wanted us to give it one more try cause we both feel we're eachothers soulmates.. but we've broken up 4 times before this one so I guess we're gonna try to better ourselves without eachother and hopefully end up once more again in the future.  I'm trying hard to get over him.. but I know he'll always be in my heart.  I love him to death.  Right now I feel lonely, and hope to find someone worth it.  I dont know if me and <b>D</b> are meant to be.. but I do know that I have a lot of love inside and I feel I want to share it with someone.  *shrug* but thats that.. whats meant to be will be, right?  Just wanted to let ya know of my current state in that department lol.  

Anyway, yesterday I went to club Deep in NYC with my friend <b>Groana</b>.  It was supposed to be 3 of us, but my other friend Nety couldnt make it. :( We was ballinnn cause mom lent me the car and shit.. mad fun.  I really liked the club.. we gonna go again next Sunday too. Maybe i'll meet the man of my dreams there lol (right).  Anyway i'll try to post some pics of that.. gotta figure out how to do that on here... 

I need new friendssssss on here! lol"

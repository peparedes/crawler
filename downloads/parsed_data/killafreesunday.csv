Hmm this last weekend i stayed with wil for his birthday while my mom and da went to port aransas.
We had much fun. Friday we went to La Porte skatepark and that was fun except that it was scorching hott. (like me)
Thursday night sucked well at least the first half did because shayna shelby janet lauren and matthew were over and that wasnt all that fun.
but then i look at my phone and it says like 20 missed calls and there all from ali and haley saying call me bitch call me bitch. how funny.
soo they come over like at 1130 and they dont go home until like 330 because we were all busy laying on wils driveway trying to sleep and calling people while we were having orgys.
saturday we went for wils bday to hooters and they made wil where this trashbag thong much funniness much much.
well fucking skip sunday because it sucked.
now its monday night 8:49 and im sooooooooo FUCKING BORED! grrr and someone never answers there text messages hmmmmmmmm.

"event","hello all
today was a good day a really good day nothing spectacular happened just you know in a really good mood. this morning i woke up and i didnt feel like wearing my contacts hehe.. lol i got to school about like 6:45 and i was already tired of being there i walked in and saw the christmas tree and i was like o boy now our school is shuving christmas shit down our throats woohoo huh. i just dont understand why its such a big deal besides the church concept i mean yea it was a big day for christ and thats awesome because i mean i dont go to church much but its still really cool for that matter. besides that i saw adams car today and it didnt look all that bad except that its missing his rear windshield and his bumper is only attached at one side ugh i think he is pretty upset about his car. i would be too though that thing was very cool. i realized that today me and christy really right alot of notes which is really cool we talk alot and about everything.
today in mr loyas class i went to the bathroom and aj and burns was in there i pretty much got malested were all good friends they just like pickin on me because im a freshman well ill show them whats up one day lol hahaha!
man mr kana put me tardy today it was gay because kelly dikeman was late to and he didnt make him get a tardy its just he hates the black man thats all 
haha well i think im gonna go and do something productive."

today i found out my old lj was deleted it upset me...:/
but other than that today was a good day....school was good adam came back today and he has spasms soo he can get more than 700 dollars for his car that is something that we thought of to scam the insurance company hahaha..me and christy are doing good right now we talked somethings out and it made me feel better about things..
school is a drag right now....people say that freshman year is your worst year but i actually think the opposite. i am actually hanging out with people that have things in common with 8th grade was boring with all the 7th graders. the christmas spirit is here and my knees are knockin in disapointment ugh. its a great holiday dont get me wrong its just that everyone is always smiling and singing and well not everyone feels the same way about it and they think everyone has to be like that 
well im gonna go help my mom get christmas decorations woohoo..."

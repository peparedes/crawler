"event","at 1 am i personally walked alone in the pitch black, shaking a tupperware full of cat food, delightfully calling out my cats name. to no avail. my cat is dead. i thought a sign post was a person. i was barefoot. then i walked in the backyard of my uncles mansion and saw a slithery animal slowly crawl into the lake. ""what the fuck was that?"" then i got a 5 foot directors chair and sat in the backyard (right next to the creepy lake) and whistled (extremely highpitchedandloud) for about an hour. my cat didnt come back, or even meow. i made dogs bark  and ducks make horrifying sounds, but no fucking meows. yesterday the cat food was gone. THAT DOESNT MATTER UNCLE STEVE. yeah yeah, itll come back huh. my cat is not coming back. i spent 3 hours in the middle of the night where its completely quiet walking around in deserted, and very cat-inviting might i add, areas of this gated ""Isle of Palms"" cody road neighborhood. my cat is not coming back. i cant believe that my cat is dead. it hadnt eaten in days because it was so scared from the 20 hour torture that is riding in vehicles. airplanes, cat carrier WAY too small for her, and cars. scared out of her mind :<. pissed all over herself multiple times. you KNOW something is scared when it shits on itself. i had her for 3 years and she only did that twice. once when she was 4 weeks old and i took her to the vet and about 5 or 6 animals were yelping at her and it smelled bad :<. and then when i was trying to take her home. it was my fault and thats not self proclaimed. well, it is.. but its true. i expected too much of her by leaving her in the garage without checking up a bunch. i was too preoccupied with trying to figure out whether or not i was repressing childhood torture memories. i made my cousin switch his major. 
music... to psychology. i drove him crazy and hes ignoring me again. im sorry if i tell the truth :<. i havent called my stepdad and he hasnt called me. he moved and i dont know where. all of my belongings are in oregon along with the only person i loved. i wish i could say my cat is there. my whole family is insane. im not joking, and its real sad to realize it. i dont know if its good that i matured enough to see it.. when every single one of them is still in denial. my cousin was molested and she didnt tell anyone. WHY DOES NO ONE KNOW ABOUT A RESTRAINING ORDER PUT ON AN OLD MAN THAT LIVED 2 HOUSES DOWN FROM MY GRANDMOTHERS WHEN SHE HAS OVER TWENTY GRANDCHILDREN NOT TO MENTION 6 KIDS OF HER OWN AND SHES LIVED NEXT TO THIS FREAK FOR OVER 40 YEARS. it blows me away :> my family is crazy and im the only one who is facing it. does anyone face it? or is it just my family that doesnt.. my god i hope its everyone. maybe im like TIGGER. oh fuck thatd be sad..
the wonderful thing about tiggers..
is tiggers are wonderful chaps
theyre loaded with vim and with vigor..
they love to leap in your laps.
theyre bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, FUN!
but the most wonderful thing about tiggers is that im the only one..
im....
the only one.

tigger is insane on that show, you know. the movies, the new show, the old show.. the books. the books are really old. and tigger has always been insane. READ 'EM. i was forced to.
hahahaimnotjokinghahahhaha.
you are all fucking lame in oregon. fuck nature, youre not going to be alive for it to end, and your whole lifes effort wont change SHIT unless youre rich or a genius. nobody does nearly as much drugs as people up there and thats why youre all punks. all of you. sure, individuality is great, but youve got no structure. and the nice thing about stating MY opinion is that i can be completely unbiased. because im from the deep, deep south, but im unstable, and i love drugs, and eugene was horrible, but so is the south. theres no balance in any state, so i am in no way supporting fucking alabama. youre just screwed up. rarely have i seen civilization there. i dont even have room for insults either, dont be a fucking moron. i suck immensely, its just theres a difference with me.. I REALIZE IT. youre all just fucking flippity floppity storybook IDIOTS. unaware and ignorant. i hate all of you. but then again, i hate everyone. get some realism, all of you, and i dare you to use an enema. THEN I WILL RESPECT YOU FOR HAVING HUMILITY YOU FUCKING PEONS. shit on yourselves and die. 


k.. that was fun. pure anger, ya know. but being absolutely honest about my opinion on most of you.. youre 14+. i dont care how smart you are, seriously. intelligence is overrated considering your age. youre all immature and i dont respect a'one'a'ya. if i was ever nice to you its because i was desperate for friendship. by the way, im pathetic. you cant insult me, its impossible, because its ALL TRUE. everything you have to say is either true or false. and ill tell ya straight up which one it is. and youll know and ill know.

FALSE.
then my sister said.
you are overweight.
TRUE.
then my cousin said.

heres a wild story:
cast:
aunt dianne, 40 something, aunt. annie, 15, cousin. teirney, 17, cousin. 
rachel, 14, sister.

so, im 13 years old, and im makin some cheese toast. i get done and i sit down at the table and eat it, blah blah. the rest of the family (that isnt mine) comes into the kitchen. teirney first walks in.
teirney: who the hell made cheese toast?
(i swallow my last bite and look up)
annie walks in with a slight hangover (15 years old)
annie: i dont know, what is there more burnt shit at the bottom? god damn.
me: *takes slight breath as if beginning to speak*-
aunt dianne zooms in with rage and fury in her golden eyeballs.
aunt dianne: JACKIE, YOURE THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER MAKES CHEESE TOAST, NOW CLEAN THIS SHIT UP.
teirney: damn, jackie. look what you do to our mother.
annie: pff, god.
rachel walks in. (my sister.)
rachel sits down.


isnt that interesting. i told you. 
i find it very odd that i remember that morning so vividly. i didnt give you the real version, because then you wouldnt understand how evil that family is. 
bad example for a story, but i dont know you well enough to give you real ones.
youre just not good enough.

oh, note:
this isnt some regular little household where nobody cares what anybody else does.
this is alabama. 2 story house with 5 or 6 bedrooms and a large pool in the backyard and the front door made of solid oak and crystal. one room is also dedicated to jewelry, ceramics, and furniture;all of these antique and from poland. all of us go to McGill Toolen Catholic High School. (notice the rich punctuation to accessorize its greatness.) ya we wear little pleated skirts and black and white saddle-oxfords to school everyday. NO MAKEUP OR NAILPOLISH!! GRR!!

down side.
all i friggin ate all weekend was pizza. 
up side.
it inspired me to stop being such a lazy moron.
i went to albertsons this morning with deke and bought a good amount of fruit. the next time you see me eating a hamburger, ill have a right to. ive already done this diet before, and i lost about 15 pounds but i was only on it for maybe a month. ive done the research and everything years ago. (this was when i did a long line of pro-anorexia diets which helped me lose 80-90 pounds all together.) i feel the motivation to fast a little right now, and im excited about it. why the fuck wouldnt i start now? food is really pointless. i wish i had the ability to eat it just for health reasons. think about it.. you cook it, smell it, put it on your plate, sit your fat ass down and get all ready to eat it. then you do. it goes down your throat... stomach.. the end. it tasted good for one crappy second, and the only thing you feel in the end is full.(or guilty). you can do that with water for christs sake. i may have an abnormal love/hate relationship with food so alot of people that i have told this, dont particularly agree with me. but thats okay. they didnt compulsively overeat for 3 years. mm, who wants 2 pizzas and 3 boxes of macaroni with a refreshing 4 glasses of milk to wash it down? mmmm.

"event","wow, just realized, looking back, everything that i thought was so huge, was just big, and really really really... long.
but that of course makes it huge.
like being locked in a basement for two years
thats what it felt like.
ever since i moved to the boonies when i was 15. i remember my 16th birthday.. i always imagined ""sweet 16"". the cousins i lived with (since i was 10) had them. they had their little parties. i didnt get any presents at all. from my FATHER. who i was living with. its not like he had to call me, like most of the angsty divorce kids. but my story was different, and it couldve turned out better. just works out that my father is a loser. really. but i wonder if i did it to myself. staying in my room for weeks because nobody outside of it talked to me anyways. i went crazy.
when i was 260 lbs, and wanted to lose weight, i stopped eating all together, and started running in 95+ degree weather. is that crazy? or desperation? i didnt even feel it. id just run so hard that my tongue would pulsate from my heartbeat. then there were the little OCDs, like sitting in my room for hours (which i did anyways), distracting myself by tearing my fingernails and toenails apart with random sharp objects. it didnt hurt, it didnt feel good, it was just detailed and took a long time. and who did i need to look good for anyways? i only needed my fingers for typing. and it didnt bother me. then i remember making extravagant letters and packages for people. for friends i met on the internet. just sending them presents and glittery over the top sequinsparklebubble bought with my social security money that i got from not having a mom. i wonder if ive been fucked up since i was a kid. pretending to be something i wasnt every chance i got. always. when i think about it.. i suddenly remember that it just was non stop. i always wanted to do something that wasnt me.. but included people. its still what i do. i fake stuff all the time. i dont even have a real personality because almost everything i do was acquired unnaturally. why the hell do i love drugs so much? why do i get sexually assaulted all the time? look at me, come on. what kind of energy do i give off that makes people think they can treat me like they know me? why am i the one always giving advice? not even to people ive known for more than a day. its almost always the first or second day when im having a heart to heart, and i feel guilty and used because i never talk to them again. whats so ungenuine about me that makes people run away? i wonder if ill ever become the person i need to be. this just isnt working. i have such high standards for friends, because ive met soooo many shitty people. 
rachelle - thief (not like me, i dont steal from friends. im just a clepto.)
horrible liar, conceited yet has no confidence, horrible music taste (eminem)nympho with no pride, yet she wants to be that way. she will never find true love.
ashley - gossip gossip gossip. lies. she will never love either. shes too shallow.
i cant even finish this list. everyone has too much wrong with them. 
why doesnt deke respect me? nevermind i know the answer to that. i dont know how to be a respectable person. all i can do is throw things out there and hope that he starts to respect me. but everything i throw is stupid and wrong. WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO FREAK OUT ON DRUGS. i know i have self control, but i just dont CARE to use it when im on drugs. ive even been soooo  royally fucked up on weed and alcohol, and got pulled over, and acted completely sober, and drove away with nothing. its like i have to be forced though. but it doesnt feel good to have no control. i need to learn how to relax and still feel good about myself. i have way too many problems.
no friends, major debt, shitty car, no job no money. and this exact situation has happened to me more than twice. more than three times, crap. it just keeps happening. i just want genuine people around me. they dont have to be funny or amazing, i just want someone to love me and ill do the same. ill bend over backwards for anyone that i admire, or want to admire. why dont i get the same in return.. why havent i ever. i miss just bitching about my aunt slapping me or pulling my hair cos she was mad at me. it was so petty and easy. better than love. love really hurts. id rather be urinating on myself because im so scared, or not eating for a week because people are visiting. i had control. i had choices. and i was never judged. no one cares. i ran away for days and no one noticed. and i had no love. thats how it should be it seems. sure, i accidentally cried every day, but there was nothing behind it. just emptiness. no pain in my chest because im being cheated on, lied to, or betrayed. why am i so sensitive and vulnerable. im made to be hurt. my existance is purely for repercussion instances. is that okay? fuck, i dont know. why do songs like ""damn it feels good to be a gangsta"" make me cry. fuck melodies they mean nothing. im too deep. literally. i get so deep inside my head that i cant even word it. the words dont exist yet. the emotions dont exist yet. the feeling the situation the thoughts, they arent real. why cant i break through to reality. i want to be a real person."

Carolyn Alexander:

Multitasking with a horrible sense of humor doesn't get you anywhere, Carolyn. You'll never be anyone, and you make me feel good about myself. I won't say you do it without even trying, because you try really, really fucking hard. It'll never pay off. Thank you, Carolyn Alexander. You give people like me, (ones that are just plain better than you), hope. You're a Hopeless Associate, and we appreciate you.

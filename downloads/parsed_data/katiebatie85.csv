"event","it's the first day of classes for my winter term and i already want it to be christmas break. it probably doesn't help that sarah and i decorated our room with lights and a christmas tree. oy.

so, i have a different german professor, and i don't like her as much as my old one. but i have a really cool anthro class about africa. and, oh! first ghana seminar! so excited.....although it was about all the shots and diseases we could get.

and i have a headache. my eyes hurt. my brain hurts. i need to sleep. someone needs to rescue me from the evil that is school."

Everything is so awful, it's hard to shield the boys from it all. I don't want to go out anymore, not with them being able to overhear things they shouldn't, but I can't very well leave them at home. What if something should happen to them, or me? I don't think I could ever live with myself if something happened to them. 

At least Amos and Acacia live close by, now. I feel slightly safer knowing that there's a wizarding family in the area, other than the Lovegoods. We can always count on them, as they can count on us. I hope nothing awful happens to any of us.

Arthur, when are you coming home? <s>I'm scared.</s> Fabian, why don't you come over? You too, Gideon! I'll set up a mattress, you can stay the night, it'll be nice. I'll make dinner, and we can all play wizarding chess or something. You can play quidditch with the boys, if you like. Cedric's staying the night with us, I'm sure he'd love to join in."

You know, Mum says that passionfruit suggests that my baby will not only have a sweet tooth, but be a girl. To be honest, I'm rather glad that I'm not craving pickles like I was with Charlie, or lemons (Percy, my little sourface). This is a good thing.

PASSIONFRUIT, ARTHUR. NOW. PLEAASSEEE.

Percy is so adorable. He just came up and hugged my stomach. Said that he was praying to Merlin to have a little sister that he could look after. Bill and Charlie just want another brother to push around.

Acacia! If you want, you can bring Cedric over and he can play with Fred and George. They're so boisterous, honestly, I can never leave them alone, or the room will go to pieces.

Oh dear God. I went into the baby shop up in the village, to buy a new rattle because Fred took the liberty of breaking the old one. I couldn't afford any of them. I could barely afford bread on the way back home. What will we do? Arthur can't possibly do any more hours at the Ministry, I'd never see him at all. I couldn't possibly get a job, not with all the boys. My wage would be gone on babysitters.

Fred and George..I don't know what is different with them. They're a lot more...violent than the other boys. They can roll around like nobodies business, but thank GOD they're beginning to sleep longer. I haven't slept without having to get up for them since we brought them home. 

Gid, can you come look after the boys while I take Fred and George to the doctors for their checkup? Please? George might even hold his arms out to you.

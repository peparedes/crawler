"event","I made it home from Estonia and Morocco after 4 months.  It was an absolutely amazing experience and I am still trying to sort it all out in my head.  Thank you to everyone who has shown an interest in talking about it.

I'm going back to Beloit on Sunday.  I'm so incredibly excited about it.  It's the last semester and that's scary and fun and should be very interesting.

Talk to you all soon."

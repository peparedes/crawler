I am so sick of people talking about me. I did NOTHING to deserve this gossip. SO STOP.

Everyone that I know from school or however is deleted except for Joe, Joe W., Britni, and Heather. I guess I can't trust you to keep your damn mouths shut about my life. I thought we were friends.

Goodbye to you, you're taking up my time."

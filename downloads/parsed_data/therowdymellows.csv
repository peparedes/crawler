"event","I've been wanting to practice the drum set. I'm too lazy to take the trip upstairs. I don't want anyone to listen to how rusty I have gotten. I miss the drums. We all hang out still. 

I'm glad I'm not in a band. LOL.

"event","Seems like there haven't been any  updates on this thing. We havent practiced. It's true. That's because we aint got an amp. I am saving money to get steven an amp. Yes I am. So far I got $240 at this rate I should get him an amp in 2 months, Or longer if I get the one I want to buy.

mmmmm I'm horny for that amp. JK! anyway. I got to go. I'm hungry"

"event","We Practiced today and i think we are sounding better every day. We are almost on the point where we can start learning real punk and not The White Stripes Songs. Christians Party was canceled until next month. Good for us. We get to practice more and more. Our song line up is, or the way i think it should be is: Fell in love with a girl, Seven nation army, Little room, I think i smell a rat, and Straight Edge. Thats only my opinion. I dont know about the rest of the band members. David seen us play today. He said were good. I hope we get signed by his friends label. That would be cool

"event","Well a slight correction on miggis lj entry. Our first show is the 13th and not the 6th. Our band is coming out coolio. I cant wait to get my amp and fucken kill on guitar. Im scared that no one will like us at vals cousins party because they probably aint all about punk or the white stripes. But fuck it we need to start somewhere. If they dont like us we will find our own crowd. Show today at night by Western and 22nd. Am i going or not. Ill ask Jackie later. I really wanna go no matter who is there. I dont care if Quatro is there.

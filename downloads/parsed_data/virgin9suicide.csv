I recently dreaded my hair again ( i dreaded my hair before and then brushed them out like after 2 weeks..I was feelin a little self conscious) I just backcombed,waxed and palmrolled. They are just a couple days old and I am trying to stay positive and not lets others comments get to me. I would luv if you guys would tell me what you think ...any advice, any help at all. I have been looking through the memories and goin through old post. One thing that would help a lot is seeing pix of people's dreads when they first started out like the first week or so.. it just helps to see what others looked like..that would help ;) ok anywho here are some pix.

"event","last night I went to rent the movie CLErks and I decided to but a BJORK cd. Listening to that cd (which is Homogenic Live) brought back sooo many memories. I had a ood friend that I was very very close to for about 2 years and she was OBSESSED with bjork like really obsessed and we would listen to bjork together all the time. She also bought all of her video's and concerts dvds and we would get all baked and watch and listen to bjork. I had a lot of goood times listening to bjork :) It just kinda rushed back a shit load of memories and its kinda sad but I am glad that of friendship fell apart cause she was a really bad oxy addict and we delt with that for awhile but I just couldn't handel it anymore. And i guess she got into meth and has been in and out of rehab. hhhmm  sad.........

I LOVE Trainspotting

shit has been a lil weird latley. My job cut my hrs so I now have 4 days off arrg. I have been really sick too so all I pretty much do is sleep,watch movies, go on the net.  Life is shitty. .. I dont think i am goin to college either cause I need to be working full time and there is no way I can go to school part time and get finacle aid (I cant spell) so i am just goin to wait untill next fall which really sux cause I was looking forward to going to school.

I told my mom that i wanted a tattoo on the back of my ear(like and my neck )  and she then decides to give me a lil talk about prioities ... just shit that I already know. Its irritating.. anyhooo I am done"

I am not goin to resize these pix cause I think they are really pretty. The sky was fucking amazing. The night that we got there (on fri) we found some shroomz, some really good shroomz :P Me and trina were frying pretty hard and we came out of the tent and there was like a purple fucking haze it was insane. There was soo much smoke and shit that it just looked crazy. Plus the music was all trippy it sounded like it was flowing in a circle around the hills lol yeah idk it was crazy shit though.

this was at the drum/fire circle. the drum cicrlce was fucking amazing I really cant even beging to descibe how awsome it was. I LOVE drum ciricle. there were also these people performing with FIRE. they would like spin fire on these rods ( i cant even describe it ... it was sooo amazing) We sat and watched these people perform with fire for a long time. It was cool are shroomz started to kick in as we were watching and then I could hear the drum ciricle right next to us. It was just fucking cool.

But this White Teeth cd is really good. The music is awsome but the lryics are really good too. I usually just listen to the music and not the lyrics but somtimes the lyrics will just stand out to me and thats how I know that I really like a cd or artist.

(I can relate to this song) 
NIN
Every Day Is Exactly The Same
I believe I can see the futureBecause I repeat the same routineI think I used to have a purposeAnd then again that might have been a dreamI think I used to have a voiceNow I never make a soundI just do what I've been toldI really don't want them to come around, oh noEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the sameI can feel their eyes are watchingIn case I lose myself againSometimes I think I'm happy hereSometimes I still pretendI can't remember how this all got startedBut I can tell you - exactly - how it will endEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the sameI'm writing on a little piece of paperI'm hoping someday you might findI'll hide it behind somethingThey don't look behindI am still inside hereA little bit comes bleeding throughI wish this could have been any other wayI just don't know what else I can doEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the sameAnd I've rehearsed my linesAnd I know what's coming next"

"event","ok well another one of those days just a really fucking stupid day. I hate my job ! i worked my days off which sux and today was no different. People are pissing me off. I fucking HATE jerry he is nothing but a fucking drunk arggg. Its one of those days when I get that thought into my head to just slice the fuck out of myself. I usally hate to say that out loud or write that in this journal but that is what i am feeling. The only reason I dont do it is because I dont want to have to deal with people's reactions. people asking ""oh what happened"" its like what the fuck does it look like. I havent cut myself for awhile well actrually its proly almost been a year which is good but some times the ""craving"" is a little much.   ok well thats enough. 

I need to call michelle. I feel bad I am not a friend to her at all, I always say i will call or hang out but i dont. She is a really good friend and a really good person. And Yes michelle I hope u read this cause it is easier for me to write this then tell you soo. I am sorry for never goin through with what i say to you dude thats not cool I know i would get sick of someone say they will hang out and they never do and theres always excuses. SO i just hope that you dont like give up on me being a friend to you I have lost a lot of friends because of my stupidity soo yeah. I had to get some of that off my chest. I just needed to ramble blah blah."

"event","well havent updated for awhile soo.. 
I got a new job. I work with my sis now which is so much fun I luv my sis we are like best friends we are way tooo close lol. I have been getting into the net a lot more mostly beacuse of otep. I go on every day and check out otep.com ! and go to my journal thing and i will be on for hours just playing around. this is a really boring entry lol oh well 

today i went to the library and check out a book on witchcraft. I was trying to find out about WICCA but they only had books on witchcraft which i found out is pretty much the same thing. You can call your self a witch and not mean it in terms of like casting spells and all that stuff. I am not able to explain it that well yet but I have been trying to find something i can use to guide me, i guess not a religion but something more spitrual. If people ask me if believe in god or what is my religion i always say i am agnostic but i would like to have something to believe in or something to guide me. I dont know. i am not making much sence but i want something to believe in thats not a god or a devil. I feel that i can find this in wicca. I am just learning. I wanna read more expand my mind (without the use of pot or shroomz). OTep has inspired me a lot in that way she is so intelligent. I would luv to be able to have a deep conversation about things other than drugs or even music there is so much more out there and i feel like i have clouded my self in a world of drugs and music. 
ok i am done that whole entry proly made no sense but oh well :)
                                 
                           THE OBSESSION IS GROWING

She sigined the bach of my shirt ( drew a little pix). Then she drew a cool pix on my sis arm and like touched her ear and others stuff wich still makes me extremly jelous :( but it was an awsome time.

SPOKANE, WA
Our first innoculation with the ferocious hoards came with a shadowy vengeance against an unknown enemy of powerful significance. It was ancient, it was progressive, it was a celebration of now. Every band on this tour offers their own blood and voice to the ritual sacrifice. And the frenzy, the suffering, the beauty of your passion fuels our creative rage night after deadly night. 

Thank you. 

I want to go to another show realy bad!!"

"event","Well turkey day was ok. It was just me and my mom and her stupid friend pasty (my mom cant stand her so my mom was kinda anoyed with her). We ate and watched the new Harry Potter ( my mom is obsessed with the movies and the books) I really like the movie it was lot darker than the others. 
After that my sis and kelsey cam over we smoked and watched the Grinch that is an interesting and funny movie when your high. Then kaila,chase,donnie came over and we played drinking cames until 2a.m. It was really fun every1 got along. I wasnt that drunk jsut really stoned every1 was drunk. 

well toady i got my check then took trina home and went to fred myers and got the new avril cd I really really like that nobody's home song !! (the rest of cd is ok not bad) then i bought Donnie Darko (awsome fucking movie !!! it is really unique and jake gyllenhaal is HOT!)  so i am goin to clean and watch my movie.

"event","well once again i havent updated in awhile. all i do now is go to work then come home and of course i still drink and smoke which that is getting really old. i need to get out and do shit beside sit around and do drugs and drink. i aslo need to start saving money. the $20 i spend on a fucking dub could go for something that actrually need. i just need to grow up and make new friends get out and do shit be productive. i really need to meet some new people the people who i hang out with the most all they do is drink they are 18 year old alcholics it is really sad. and i am addicted to drugs. it sux to get that feeling that i need some sort of drug to get through the day or night. it really isnt that cool to be a pot head or a drugie. well anyways i am just venting i just need to change things in my life just get out and experince things. it is kinda hard though because i feel tied down because of my mom. i know that she needs me emotionally and she needs my finacial help too and plus i dont want to think if i ever moved or anything that i would be  missing out on time that i could of spent with my mom ( i know that i dont have a lot of time left with her ) it is just really HARD somethimes now!! 


ok i am done now. iam goin to bed :P"

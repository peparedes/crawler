E:

You take the Stairway to Heaven. Why stay down when you can go up? You, my ambitious friend, are going places, following your dreams. Good for you. Few people chase their dreams anymore. Never give that up. You are heading up in the world, making a name for yourself, even if it's just a small group who know it. You're finding your way and are heading straight for the top. You've got all the qualities of a great leader and are probably a very optimistic individual. Though you can be a bit selfish at times and have a tendency to step over people in your way. You must watch that. You could end up hurting the ones you love if you put your own goals above them. Never lose faith in that dream of yours, but make sure you can keep those close to you because in the end they'll be the ones to get you through the tough times. You have found your place and yourself, few can do so well and still struggle to find themselves. Don't let go of that sense of self you have even in times of confusion, it will help you pull through. Be careful of your ego too, you could lose your balances and once you're at the top, it's a very long way down. So be mindful of others, strive forward to reach your dream, whatever it may be, be true to yourself, and you keep going up. Don't let anyone pull you down.

<P>and for those who forgot to find their bra size(guys too!):
Wearing a great fitting bra will help your clothes look and feel great. Unfortunately, more than 70% of women are wearing the wrong size and style of bra. Don't be one of them!

Follow these four easy steps to ensure you are shopping for your bra size:

Measurement number 1:
Measure under your bust line.
Put on your best-fitting, unpadded, under wire bra. Measure underneath the bust line and make sure to measure tightly. Be sure the tape measure is straight across your back.

The general rule of thumb for all measuring is: less than 1/2"", round DOWN, more than a 1/2"", round UP. So if your measurement is 32 1/4, call it 32. Write this number down. This is measurement number 1.

Band Size:
Calculate your band size.
If measurement 1 is UNDER 33 inches, add 5 inches. If this number is odd, round up to the next EVEN number. If measurement 1 is OVER 33 inches, add 3 inches. If this number is odd, round up to the next EVEN number. Write this EVEN number down. This is your band size.

Measurement number 2:
Measure over the bust line
Measure over the biggest point of your bust line. This is a looser measurement. Make sure the tape measure is straight. Write this number down. This is measurement number 2.

Cup Size:
Calculate your cup size.
First subtract measurement number 1 from measurement number 2. Then consult the following chart to find your cup size.

this doesnt really work..cuase it says im a 36 DD...no where neer that..or maybe im calculating wrong...ya ok  thats more like it....i got it  now..have fun!"

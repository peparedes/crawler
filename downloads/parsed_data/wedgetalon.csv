Meanwhile an item I order from a different major online retailer FOUR DAYS later than my Amazon order (Dec 31st) has already been shipped and is due to arrive on the 8th.

This is why I haven't shopped regularly at Amazon. They're the Walmart of e-tailers. They promise the sky and deliver much less. They had good prices on what I wanted so I went ahead and ordered this time, but I was wrong. I would have rather paid more elsewhere and get the items sooner (by over a week!) had I known they would be delayed like this. At this point, it's too late.

"event","<h3>Organize</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Next actions - For every item requiring your attention, decide what is the next action that you can physically take on it. For example, if the item is 'Write project report', the next action might be 'Email Fred for meeting minutes', or 'Call Jim to ask about report requirements', or something similar. Though there may be many steps and actions required to complete the item, there will always be something that you need to do first, and this should be recorded in the next actions list. Preferably, these are organized by the context in which they can be done, such as 'in the office', 'by the phone', or 'at the store'.</li>
<li>Projects - every 'open loop' in your life or work which requires more than one physical action to achieve becomes a 'project'. These are tracked and periodically reviewed to make sure that every project has a next action associated with it and can thus be moved forward.</li>
<li>Waiting for - when you have delegated an action to someone else or are waiting for some external event before you can move a project forward, this must be tracked in your system and periodically checked to see if action is due or a reminder needs to be sent.</li>
<li>Someday/Maybe - things that you want to do at some point, but not right now. Examples might be 'learn Chinese', or 'take diving holiday'.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>A calendar is also important for keeping track of your appointments and commitments; however, it should be reserved for things which absolutely have to be done by a particular deadline, or meetings and appointments which are fixed in time and place. 'To-do' items should be reserved for the next action lists.</p>
<p>A final key organizing component of GTD is the filing system. Getting Things Done says that a filing system, if it is to be used, must be easy, simple and fun. Even a single piece of paper, if you need it for reference, should get its own file if it doesn't belong in a folder you already have.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>The lists of actions and reminders will be of little use if you don't review them at least daily, or whenever you have time available. <strong>Given the time, energy and resources that you have at that particular moment, decide what is the most important thing for you to be doing right now, and <em>do it</em>.</strong></p>
<p>At least weekly, the discipline of GTD requires that you review all your outstanding actions, projects and 'waiting for' items, making sure that any new tasks or forthcoming events are entered into your system, and that everything is up to date. The creation of a tickler file is suggested in order to help refresh your memory each week with your outstanding tasks and projects.</p>

<h3>Do</h3>

<p>Any organizational system is no good if you spend all your time <em>organizing</em> your tasks instead of actually <em>doing</em> them! If you can make it simple, easy and fun to take the actions that you need to take, you will be less inclined to procrastinate or become overwhelmed with too many 'open loops'.</p>"

.002 Dollars == .00002 Cents

It's really quite disturbing to listen to these people ask the caller to ""do the math"", then proceed to spout off this equation: .002 cents per kilobyte times 35893 kilobytes = 71.79 DOLLARS. Erm, where did the dollars come into play on the LEFT side of that equation again?!

Sigh. You can listen to the recording of this <a href=""http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/asinine/transcript-verizon-doesnt-know-how-to-count-220723.php"">here</a> (transcript included)

At least we wouldn't until our financials are more secure and stable. Let me know if you want other ideas (unless you went ahead with your original already. If you did, that's fine. Trust me, it will still be used and very much appreciated. We both just hated the thought of you making that investment and then us letting it fall to the wayside later on.)

Whew! Also, we have an idea for something to get you, but if there's certain things you really want, make a list and we'll see if we can maybe pick one of those up for you.

1) I'm uncertain what he means that the theme is bulky. It seems the same size as the previous to me. I'm not really a fan of Firefox's default themes anyway (though 9/10 times I end up using it because I'm lazy). At any rate, if you hate it so much, just grab a new theme! How about Pimpzilla? ;)

2) Blacklist based anti-phishing is a decent enough way to do it, as long as it is being actively maintained. This is also the first release of anti-phishing, so I would give it time to improve. As for privacy, you can choose between querying Google live or using a downloaded database. Obviously, the downloaded one doesn't check Google on every site you visit, thus negating the stated privacy issue (duh).

3) I find the new dialog better designed and shows all of the essential options. For revealing more advanced options, there are extensions and about:config.

4) I have 46 extensions installed. 6 were incompatible. They were:
<ul>
<li>antipagination - valid incompatibility</li>
<li>No Go - It's no longer the Go menu, but history now. IMO though, still Valid.</li>
<li>Screen Grab - Valid.</li>
<li>Session saver - not required!</li>
<li>Show image -  valid</li>
<li>undoclosetab - not required? I dunno if it was integrated, but my extension is SUPPOSED TO be disabled, yet I have an Undo option.</li>
</ul>

5) The memory issue is BETTER, though not fixed. Sticking with 1.5 over his bullet point on this would be stupid.

6) I have not seen a single CSS issue added to Firefox 2. Granted, I don't use Yahoo. Was this issue really ADDED, or did it exist previously?

7) My freezing issues have IMPROVED. Freezing is always a valid concern, though I doubt it should be a deal-breaker, especially with integrated session saving.

8) I've never hit this bug, but it sounds a valid concern. I wouldn't let this keep me from upgrading.

9) I disagree, I think it has improved, but still has a ways to go.



So, of his nine bullets, he has, what, two decent reasons not to upgrade? Neither of which, IMO, should be a deal breaker? Especially with all that you gain."

I have read books whose violence far exceeds anything that I have seen done in video games. And yet there is no ratings system. No age restrictions. It is viewed as healthy to read. And if one were to try to censor out books, likely they would be shunned by society, for we have at least - hopefully - learned the importance of the written word, whether fact or fiction. But the overloked reality is that games, movies, television, and music are hardly different from books. Sure, they are different mediums, but they exist in the same functions and are just as important in our society - if not moreso in this technilogical age.

The core issues that so few really want to acknowledge - or at least so few of those appearing in media want to acknowledge - is that the onus of censorship of these mediums falls on parents, not government. But parents these days don't seem to want the hassle of actually paying their children mind. They want others - anyone! - to raise their kids, their precious wittle babies. Parents have seemingly lost their sense of responsibility."

This article details all non-etablished-IP games that they think are going to be great, and in the proccess give us a look into which console they like most.

Note, in my statistics I made one correction: there's <a href=""http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/26/the-mystery-of-assassins-creeds-exclusivity/"">been rumour</a> that Assassin's Creed will NOT be PS3 exclusive and will, in fact, appear on the x360. My statistics assume this to be true as all signs point to such.

Of all the games listed, here are the totals coming out for each system:
XBox:1, PS2:7, PSP:4, DS:5, Wii:4, PS3:17, and 360:22.

There are 7 titles that are shared between PS3 and 360,  brining their UNIQUE games totals to PS3-9, 360-14. Obviously the 360 has a bit of a lead on non-established franchises. But that's just pure numbers. Obviously game #50 isn't as good as #1, so here are some weighted totals:
With shared games: PS3-101, 360-116
Without: PS3-63, 360-88

Analysis and full list of games included after the jump.
<lj-cut text=""Read More"">
So, sorry to disappoint, but it looks like if EGM has a bias, it's only slightly to MS. The most telling things in these numbers, however, is the weighted* totals without shared games - a 25 point difference between Sony and MS. I'd be willing to bet too that most of those PS3 exclusives will see their release on 360 as well. So, $300 or $600, which to choose? I never thought I'd throw my lot with them, but I think the 360 <b>will</b> be able to edge out the PS3. I don't think it will be a sweeping victory, but it will nonetheless be one.

One surprising tidbit worth throwing in is the number of quality PS<em>2</em> games slated for release. It almost seems as if Sony is taking the PS3 as a joke with several big-name titles launching for the PS2 without any sort of ""upgraded"" version at least making an appearance on the PS3.

The real winner at the end of the day, however, I still believe will be Nintendo with their Wii. Since this list only contained new IP, there are a good many of the relatively few announced Wii titles on the list, including the simplistic Wii Sports slipping in at #11.

*The ratings were weighted as follows:
01-10|10 points
11-20| 7 points
21-30| 5 points
31-40| 3 points
41-50| 1 points

50|DS Air - DS
49|Cipher Complex - PS3,360
48|Blue Dragon - 360
47|Elebits - Wii
46|Crackdown - 360
45|Contact - DS
44|Fatal Inertia - PS3
43|Rule of Rose - PS2
42|Rogue Galaxy - PS2

Why haven't we ""spread freedom"" to N.Korea?

Consider this:

Iraq:
* Hated the USA
* Supposedly had WMDs (though we STILL haven't found any)
* Had many human rights violations

N.Korea:
* Hates the USA
* HAS WMDs
* Has many human rights violations

If it was enough for Iraq, why is N.Korea seemingly considered a joke?"

The Bundle:
DS Lite

3 Styli
Brain Age

Buy 2 Get 1 Games:
3 copies of New Super Mario Brothers
1 copy of NSMB was traded for Nintendogs Dachshund
1 copy of NSMB was traded for Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time
Metroid Prime: Hunters
Animal Crosing: Wild World
Super Princess Peach

Total spent? 254.92, before tax.

"event","There's a lot of hate for IE in the web developer community, so I thought I'd point out 4 reasons why we should LOVE it... because I'm too laxy to do more.

1) <b>Encourages Creativity!</b> Thanks to its lousy support of standards, devs everywhere have to engineer terrific workarounds, some of which have been called ""brilliant"" and gained the author much clout. Example: http://dean.edwards.name

2) <b>Forces More Testing!</b> Do to rendering differences, you the dev has to test in multiple browsers AND fix any problems. this leads to spending more time on one problem/site which leads to a fatter paycheck from the client. More money is always a good thing, right?

3) <b>Enables Shoddy Code!</b> IE enables new, naive web devs to learn to write code incorrectly. These people think there Geocities-esque sites are great, and are then somehow able to sell this idea to businesses. We real devs can then come in and show them the light without even having to convince them of why they need a web presence to begin with! A much easier task and more money for us! And as you've seen, money == good!

4) <b>Encourages competition!</b> Without IE there would be no Anti-IE movement! So all you alternative browser users, thank IE for your increasing market share!"

<h3>Or, why ComputerWorld is wrong about the 20 bad things about Vista.</h3>

<b>20. Minimum video system requirements are more like maximum.</b>
A few points about this:
a) The 128MB video card is just to use Aero. Vista will still work without it.
b) The requirement will probably go down. Typically when a product is in Beta, the requirements are set at a reasonable level. They are then lowered by release to something that will barely run it. [Personally, I would prefer if everyone just gave the 'recommened requirements' in place of minimum.]
c) If you look at the 128MB cards that are out there, it is a fairly good baseline of video card to expect to have and get any sort of decent 3D performance and somewhat-modern features. Sure, some lower cards will out perform a 128, but with the prices so low and the choices shrinking, there's little point to even pointing this out (except as trivia).

<b>19. Aero stratification will cause businesses woe.</b>
His arguement on this point seems to consist of saying that execs and employees will want the cool look of Aero instead of being bumped down to the basic (which IT will want to do due to system requirements). Boohoo. A large number of companies still run Win2000 and get along just fine without XP's interface.

<b>18. User Account Controls $#^%!~\!!!.</b>
I will give that, according to reports, UAC does bug the user more than it should (hopefully this will be ironed out in beta). However, beyond that, his ""protecting users from themselves"" is just whining for whining sake. Of course you want to protect your computer from yourself a bit (yes, users will accidentally (or purposefully) try to delete the system or other valuable folder(s)), but it also protects from rogue scripts doing bad things. UAC is a *good thing*.

<b>17. Two words: Secure Desktop.</b>
More whining about the previous one. *yawn*

<b>16. No way to access the Administrator account in Vista Beta 2.</b>
For some reason I find it hard to believe that there would be no sort of root account. FUD anyone?

<b>15. Some first-blush networking peeves.</b>
This argument amounts to:
a) They took away my my quick method of accessing advanced properties! Waaaah!
b) They added more advanced networking features such as IPv6 and it got more confusing! Waaaah!
My response: Boohoo ya baby.

<b>14. Windows peer networking is still balky.</b>
For me, the vioewing of newly added computers to the network has always worked about 90% of the time, unless I really screwed up some settings (and then it would still even sometimes find them!). Hardly whine-worthy, though that seems to be the theme.

<b>13. Network settings user experience went backwards.</b>
Paraphrased: It takes more clicks to get to he advanced network setup.
Awwwww.

<b>12. Too many Network Control Panel applets, wizards and dialogs.</b>
This is a complaint that there are too many panels/wizards to control specific things. Sounds to me like he's wanting them to be hidden behind another click or two.... right after he complained about things taking too many click. Puh-leeeease.

<b>11. Display settings have changed for no apparently good reason.</b>
The mish-mash of things you could do from the rightclick on desktop -> properties has been moved to more logical places. Aww.

<b>10. Where are the file menus?</b>
He's complaining about MS trying to move people away from the ""file, edit, etc"" menu bar by hiding it in most cases by default. I for one welcome the change. These menus have out lived their usefullness if you ask me. There are easier and more intuitive ways to present users with options IMO.

<b>9. Windows Defender Beta 2 is buggy.</b>
Let me say this again... a BETA is BUGGY. OH NOES~!!!!~!#

<b>8. Problems without solutions.</b>
Awww, the Vista BETA still has BUGS! WOW!

<b>7. Lack of Windows Sidebar Gadgets.</b>
Yeah, that's an inconvenience. I can agree it needs more gadgets. Of course, I also think Google Desktop and DekstopSidebar need both more gadets and more refining. Hardly worth crucifying Vista for.

<b>6. Media Center isn't all there and falls flat.</b>
Despite what his heading says, this is actually a complaint that his video card driver crashes under vista when he uses live TV. Not exactly end of the world. Obviously ATI (and NVIDIA) are trying to get their drivers sorted for Vista's release. Oh, he also goes on to make some general points about MCE's feel that haven't already been said by Paul (of win supersite).

<b>5. Faulty assumption on the Start Menu.</b>
Apparently MS has a conspiracy revolving around users putting their computer to sleep every night instead of turning it completely off (and thus saving wear-and-tear and drastically cutting perceivedd shut-down/startup times). Seems like a smart move to me. I would think this would be fairly beneficial, as long as it's not actually called ""shut down"" (which it's not... it's called sleep.).

<b>4. Installation takes forever.</b>
And WinXP/Win2000/MacOSX/Gentoo/etc don't take forever to install? These are huge, highly complex programs that control your entire PC experience. For a (theoretically) one time thing, I can live with that. Plus they moved all user input to the FRONT of the install, so you don't have to attend to it after initial inupt! Double-plus good!

<b>3. Version control.</b>
Apparently, it's confusing that the typical home user should choose the 'home' version (either basic or premium depending on features), and all other advanced users should consider the other versions. Wow, confusing.

<b>2. Price.</b>
""If Windows Vista Ultimate is the version of Vista many of us are going to want, how much are we going to have to pay for it?"" <- Maybe you should define ""us"". Joe Average probably won't want Ultimate (unless he craps cash). Outside of businesses, that's the primary market. Most Windows installs will be preinstalls, not upgrades.So what if Windows is going to be pricey? It always is. Same old same old.

<b>1. Little originality, sometimes with a loss of elegance.</b>
This argument boils down to two things:
a) I don't liiiiiiiiiike it. :'(
b) They stole stuff from Apple and Firefox! AHHH!

This is mostly because I was greedy for userpics and they now offer a new level called sponsored+ which gives 9 additional avatar slots as well as some <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/site/accounts.bml"">other stuff</a> that's not quite as exciting to me."

"event","So, the <a href=""http://esrb.org"">ESRB</a> has a new website. And it sucks. Bad. *sigh* Where to start?

Yellow. Retina searing yellow. Perhaps this horrendous splattering of neon yellow was a decision forced upon the poor guy who did the site's design. Or perhaps the guy just has no taste. At any rate, the colour needs to be scaled back. And it's set off by black. On the first page it makes for, IMO, too dark of a site (ironically enough). Overall, they <i>basically</i> use two shades of yellow and several different shades of gray/black. They should have gone for something much more colourful and was appealing in a kid-and-parent-friendly sort of way. A range of pastels would definitely have fit them better.

(edit) Oh, and come on guys, when are we going to stop smushing all of our content to the left. If your design just <i>has</i> to be fixed width, then for goodness sake, center align it. &lt;/pet peeve&gt; Ideally it should expand to fill the screen as best as your content allows, especially considering that LCDs are becoming more common with resolutions starting at 1024x768 or higher; also the laptop market is seeing a lot of widescreen units being sold. These sorts of designs look especially weird on those.

Next, the organisation of the sections. JavaScript drop downs suck. All of them. They were neat when I was playing around with them ten years ago. And really there's no need for them. Nothing under the ""game publishers"" section is available to the public. So rip that out. The only things under ""retailers"" is a miniature FAQ and a short list of retailers that by all means could have very easily been included in said FAQ. The FAQ would be then be better served as part of a general FAQ (which already exists). So the ""retailrs"" section is gone now.

Next, ""privacy online."" Let's take this sub-section by sub-section. <i>How to Join</i> - This is for companies to join the ESRB ""Privacy Online"" program. It would fit better elsewhere (explained later). <i>Certified Websites</i> - This is a valid section, if it were explain what the certification was. Add a heading paragraph and it's good. <i>Privacy Resource</i> - To be honest, I'm not really sure what their purpose of this section is. I mean, it's good information, but all the ESRB really needs to provide is their own privacy policy, not links to tips and tricks about privacy. Their concern is supposed to be games' ratings. It should be 86'd. <i>Contact Privacy Online</i> - This should be consolidated into a general 'Contact Us' form.

Now we're left with the content of everything under ""about ESRB"" and ""ESRB ratings"".

about ESRB
news | Education | Resources | FAQ | Contact

ESRB ratings
guide | process | enforcement | resources | FAQ | Contact

As you can see, this can be easily consolidated.
guide | education | process and enforcement | resources | news (press releases) | FAQ  | contact

There's also one more section I would add in. <b>Browse Ratings</b>. It would come up with a list of the, say, 25 newest games and above the listings would give links that would restrict it to the 25 newest of each platform. This would be the first section listed as it is the most useful.

Along the bottom could be an ""ERSB Member Login"" link for retailers and publishers to login and/or register. All of the stuff I said to ditch from their two sections would be tidily hidden away behind the login. There's no reason to display it the general public as you're not trying to tempt them to join.

Now they would be left with a <i>simple</i>, clean menu, quickly available information, and a friendly, cheerful design. The only thing left would be to work on those section titles just a bit to make sure they are concise, yet fully accurate."

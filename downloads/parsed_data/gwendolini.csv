Hi! Wow, it's been forever. To all of you whom I haven't spoken to in FOREVER, I'm really super sorry, but things have calmed down so I think I have more time to stay in touch. Just know that everytime I hear from you I smile all over. 
Vassar is awesome. I love it here. Love the classes, love the people. My roommate rocks. I've been in two shows thus far and am rehearsing for a third. The first, the Cherry Orchard, was an absolute catastrophe. Creepy, terrible director. Cool cast though, so I'm glad I met them even though Chekhov is definitely turning in his grave at about 1,000 revolutions per minute. 
Then directors workshops, a much better experience.
And now, Much Ado About Nothing! Yay! I'm playing Hero! Yay! I'm super excited! Yay!
Oh, and there's so much more I can't even begin to think about let alone write. In short, I'm very happy and I love all of you and hope you're all doing marvelously.

Love,Me"

"event","Today we had our first clowning class. It was absolutely horrific. I had heard of the Ring of Fire before, and I knew what it was, but never in my wildest imaginings could I ever have concieved how bad it really is. Here's what you do: the class forms a circle of chairs, and one by one each actor enters the circle. That actor can do whatever he/she wants, but cannot leave the circle until he/she makes the entire circle laugh at the same time. Or until two minutes are up. Sweet Jesus. We all failed miserably, and yet I still cannot believe how badly it makes me feel. The point is to learn where failure lives in your body, how you react to it because apparently, clowns live in failure. The rest of the class was actually really really fun. We played games and were silly and got beat on the head with a stick and threw balls around. Stuff like that. But I can't get the Ring of Fire out of my head. I want to try it again. It's sadistic, really.
Other than that I've been great. Eating lots of icecream, hanging out with Ned and the kids here, being a starfish, learning about my ""shakras."" My scene is turning out to be super-fun. Hooray for Shakespeare! Love to all."

"event","I am feeling so so so much better thanks to some sleep and some new friends. Friends are great, I love friends. I especially love you guys. Thanks so much for the encouragement, it makes me feel ten times better. Oh, and guess what? We were assigned scenes a couple of days ago and I'm doing the Miranda/Ferdinand Logge-man Tempest scene with this cool cat Casey! Coincidence? I think not! Well, I suppose it is...Anyway, it's very exciting. We've done dropping in (very intense: scene partners sitting in each other's faces with two teachers whispering in their ear these questions after every single word. Example: ""O. What do you want to say to him? O. Do you want to have sex with him? O. Is the blood rising in your cheeks? O. What would he look like naked? Father. Do you love your father? Father. Do you hate your father? Father. Is your father growing old? Father. Will he die soon? Father. Will that leave you all alone?"" and on and on like that for an hour and a half staring into your scene partners eyes. And that was only half the scene. So in total it took three hours just do to that small amount of text.) And then standing up, which is the same but...well...standing up. And tonight we do our first text work. Hooray! Work!"

"event","I'm fucking tired. I'm tired of this. I'm tired of all these new people, baring my soul every fifteen minutes, the highs and lows that come with this place. It's like Mountain School all over again, and we all know how good that was for me. On the one hand, I feel that I'm growing as a person. Hopefully after all this fucking opening up I'll be less of a shy person and more stable in my self. But for now, I can't wait to get out. Which, I suppose, is why we have a break on Monday. Oh my god, I need it so badly. I just need some time out. I need some sleep, some time to be in my comfort level, not to be scanning my life for horrific incidents and then telling people about them. I just need some familiarity. A song, a face. I miss you guys a lot. I will have so much to tell you after this is over."

"event","So I'm beginning to breathe through my ass. No joke. Through my ass. Every time I take a breath now (when I relax), I feel my sphincter muscle let go like I'm about to take a poo. IT FEELS GREAT! And it's a major breakthrough for me. Yay! And today in voice, when I breathed out, I could feel my whole body jiggle like a wave of jelly. So fucking cool. So I'm making blissful progress. I named my voice Sally. 

Some of this stuff is terrifying. Like today we had to do this whole thing in front of everybody and one of the questions was ""what I don't want to tell you is..."" and it was absolutely fucking the scariest thing I've ever done but it was wierd because instead of having a breakdown, I had this complete high of joy that lasted for like ten minutes.

Did you know that, according to a scientific study, the stress a trained, experienced professional actor goes through as he/she steps on stage is equivalent to a car crash? Crazy."

"event","Mmm...I just went for a lovely run. It's twenty to breakfast, and then I have a hunch we'll be doing voice again this morning and Basics I this afternoon and seeing As You Like It tonight. That would be a good schedule. Basics I rocks. We're split into two groups with three teachers per group and while none of the teachers are like Jonathan Epstein, they make you feel much more comfortable. So, you cry less because they're scary and more because they're kind. It's good. A very good vibe. I haven't worked my piece yet, but I'm looking forward to it. We did them all at the beginning though, so most of my jitters are gone. That's all I really have to say. I'm hungry."

"event","So I'm beginning to realize that the reason I knew nothing about the program before I came is not a lack of communication, it's a theory. It's a practice, a lesson. We only know what we're doing about half an hour before we do it. As in, we'll wake up to find our morning class posted, go to lunch to find our afternoon class posted, and go to dinner to find our evening class posted. They think this will keep our head in the lesson and away from ""oh god, I have to do my monologue tonight."" And it works. Yesterday we did an exercize as the teachers watched with these big terrible black binders filled with all our headshots, resumes, essays, and god knows what else. It was one of those let's be five, let's be twelve, let's be thirteen things so basically not only do they know your face, they know everything about your growing up. They see you as a shy five-year-old, an awkward thirteen-year-old. It's scary to let people into all of that, especially when most of us (going to college especially) want to move past it. And yes, of course, I am the youngest here. Most people will be seniors in college or have already graduated. There's one girl who will be a sophomore. This is also fucking scary as hell, but they're nice and kind to me and funny and some of them know my secret: that I'm not actually in college yet. It's wierd to talk about my ""school"" and then realize that they think I mean Vassar. It's also really cool that most of them mistook me for heading into my senior year at college. This morning we did a beginning vocal exercize with this amazing man named Antonio and a little movement to accompany it with a woman named Kate. I almost threw up and fainted at the same time. Oh my god, I felt so sick. And I went up to Antonio and was like ""what the hell should I do? What's going on?"" and he told me that it's because my body's not used to so much oxygen and that I should go ahead and throw up on the floor or faint because people will catch me and clean it up. I dunno, but I might take him up on that. I mean, if that's what he wants me to do...I might feel better. So yeah, basically I feel like I've lived my whole five weeks in this one day. I can't can't CAN'T believe how much we're going to accomplish in the next several weeks. Crazy. IT'S CRAZY. And fucking difficult as hell."

"event","Here's my sonnet (let's see if I can do it from memory...)

15

When I consider every living thing
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth naught but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
When I percieve that men as plants increase,
Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky,
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory;
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,
To turn your day of youth to sullied night;
And all at war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

WOOHOO!!"

I keep thinking...oh, but I want all my laundry to be done or oh, but I'm going to have to brush my teeth in the next three days, so I can't pack any of that stuff now. I hate packing. Hate it. Well, at least I know there's a drug mart near the campus so I can buy toothpaste or whatever if I leave it behind. Oh my god I can't even handle the suspense anymore. I can't believe it's so close. SO CLOSE. Hooray for meeting dorks like me! I should really get on the material I need to know...I'm thinking that fucking awful Juliet monologue, the one where she drinks the poison? It scares the crap out of me so I feel like I should do it. And I have to pick a new sonnet. It's my excuse to learn new material.

Ooh! and I finished my silk painting. It's kinda neat except there's a big black blotch in the corner. I just have to set it and then I'm done! Hooray!

Saw Hannah and Sean last night in the Tempest. Everyone should go see it! It's tempestuous! And Hannah and Sean are great, as always. And of course Mr. Hawkes. Free Shakespeare. Outside. What's not to love?

The last few days have been pretty relaxing. Preparing for college and Shakespeare, things of that nature. I'm really bummed that things didn't work out yesterday because of a stupid doctor's appointment. The best part is, he doesn't know what I have either. He made certain... implications and then said ""yeah, I don't really know. Take these and hope it clears up."" They're fucking horse pills is what they are. Well, at least it's not strep.
Oh, and I watched Topsy-Turvy with my dad yesterday. It's about Gilbert and Sullivan, and it's alright (Jim Broadbent's a genius) but the crowning moment was when Andy Serkis made an appearance as a choreographer. Mmm...Gollum so sexy."

"event","Hello everybody!
Does anybody else experience a really strange feeling in the summer? It's like thirst, but it can't be quenched. It's like pining for something similar to water, but when you drink a glass of water, it doesn't go away. It never goes away. The feeling is especially prevalent while wearing a bathing suit. Am I just weird? Somebody tell me they feel the same way! It's like homesickness...but I'm home. I love it and hate it at the same time.
Anyhow. Summer's great. I've been reading a lot. I just finished The Hours which I highly recommend even if you didn't like the movie because I didn't like the movie, but this book is astounding, especially if you've read Mrs. Dalloway. And I've started Kissing in Manhattan (cheers, Maddie!) by David Schickler who is amazing. It's very G. G. Marquez meets David Sedaris. Eh. Kind of. And hanging out with people. You know how you do. 
Oh, and I cut my hair really short. It's fun and kind of poofy but in a way I'm okay with.
Hurrah!"

And our flight was delayed because of summer storms on the east coast. And delayed again. And delayed again until finally we missed our flight from Newark to Glasgow. Big bummer. So we're trying again today. This time we got an earlier flight to Newark in hopes that even if it is delayed, we'll still make our connecting flight. The sad part is, even though I had an extra day at home, there was nothing I could do with it! So sad. Well, here we go again..."

I'm on the farm. Ahh...It feels so good. Dirt. Everywhere. Kids. Plants. It's really, really cold, but so sunny you hardly notice. Very beautiful. We transplanted a lot of stuff today, both into bigger seedling trays and the field. Dirt under fingernails. Gritty. Soft. Moist (love that word, to all who hate it). My sister and I stayed up talking late last night and so now I'm tired. As shown by my extremely poorly written entry. We rocked and put our feet up on the wood stove and looked through her old yearbooks. Bella is quite reasonable now, and Henry is just beginning to talk. They like watching this signlanguage video, and the themesong is stuck in my head like Pooh in the doorway. You know? Yeah, it's time to go to bed."

"event","It's like a fever. I can't eat, can't sleep. All I can think about is working more. I wake up at 5am and find myself thinking about Leer and Cordelia. Yesterday we worked from ten to ten. Basically, we each got up and did one of our monologues and he coached us through, picking out things to prove points he was making, highlighting the antithesis, the ethos (ethics), pathos (passions), logos (logic). Things like that. So I get up, right, and I'm shaking, I'm so scared. Not that I'm terrible by these standards, it's not that. I'm holding my own. It's just that I'm absolutely terrified of him and his opinion of me. He's  a very scary man. 'Intense' doesn't even begin to describe what he is. So I do my monologue, and he says okay, now antithesis etc., like you're serving a tennis ball. And I do, kind of. And he begins to set up the scene. It's a Hermione monologue from the Winter's Tale, and I'm on trial for being unfaithful to my husband, the king. And he says shame. And I think okay, shame is good. Shame is very easy for me. He says just take a moment to begin to understand the shame you feel. Look around. And I do. And I can feel the blood rushing to my face. And he does this thing where he stands just next to you and focuses on you with his entire body and mind and strokes your cheek with his thumb. And it's so gentle. And I'm really into it, right? And so as soon as I begin my monologue, I burst out crying. And I sob my way through half of it. Real tears. I mean, I'm really going at it. And then I get real pissed off and we play with logos, pathos, ethos with the second half of the thing. And he says great, and I sit down. And I'm totally soaked and drained, but god what a feeling.  Holy shit, guys. The man's a fucking genius. So that's my day. The people here are awesome. It's great. Sometimes I forget I'm only eighteen. We go for food, go to the bar at the end of the day. I guess it makes me feel very grown up. And the thing that connects us all is this language, this beautiful language. It truly breaks down boundaries."

Holy shit. Holy SHIT guys. There's so much to learn. I can't even begin to fathom. We worked three and a half hours yesterday, and I didn't even notice. Once, I took a bathroom break and all I could think was ""Hurry UP, Gwen. I need to get back in there."" He's even better than I remember. Every time he says a bit of text, I fall in love for a second. He's captivating. And has two sons....Well, nevermind that. One's named Tiger :). The dorms here are alright. Well, pieces of shit. But I don't even notice them. It's like the text creates this lovely plush environment that I can walk around in without caring about my surroundings. Which is exactly opposite his point. I know, I know, ground the text in reality. But maybe what I mean is that the text makes reality seem more important, more beautiful. God, if that could happen to everyone? There would be no war. We'd all be scholars. Ten more hours today. Holy shit guys. I'm in love with a dead man. Fuckin' A.

I wouldn't even have recognized him, but Meezie said ""oh my god, that's Christ Cassinidi!"" He didn't recognize either of us, so it was a little awkward. Felt sort of like a stalker. Welcome to my life. AND the best friend of a girl I grew up with who then moved to Pittsburg and then Kansas. Coincidence? I think not. It felt kind of like a huge finale at the end of a play, like my childhood is being swept up into song and dance.

Basically I'm procrastinating and the spirit moved me so here I am back at my livejournal. Here's what I should be doing now:
Finding a monologue from Shkspr's later works
Reading the Enormous Room (great book!!!)
Doing physics
Doing stat
I'm excited for prom, it's going to be a good time. It makes me nervous, prom. I always have a good time, though, so I don't know why I'm worried.
Can I just say for a minute how much I love Shakespeare? I love him. I do. I could spend the rest of my life devoted to his works. It's so beautiful and so true and so sad and so poignant and so funny but all of his humour is so good because it's SO HEART-WRENCHING. God. Just humour me for a moment.

The course of true love never did run smooth,
But either it was different in blood...
Or else misgraffed, in respect of years...
Or else it stood upon the choice of merit...
Or if there were a sympathy in choice, 
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it;
Making it momentary as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That (in a spleene) unfolds both heaven and earth
And ere a man hath power to say, behold,
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
So quick bright things come to confusion.


OH MY GOD!! Can you even believe it??"

Just one more Saturday of stale bagels and cabbage-smelling cafeterias and people dressed in black skirts and suitcoats, miserable, tired, bored. It can't be that bad, right? WRONG! This past hour has been a memorizing hell. The only thing that keeps me going is the embarrassment that awaits if I don't get the whole thing down word for word. It's so much more difficult to memorize a speech. A dramatic piece, see, has a plot. A line to follow. As does a speech, I suppose, but it's much more obscure and not as linear. Or colloquial (which would make it so much easier to remember). I have one more day to work on this thing. I barely remember how it begins...""I want to take you on a 600 year tour of history."" Mistake number one: don't pick a speech which promises to cover 600 years of history. It's a good speech. But bejeez, if I read it one more time I think I'll barf. If all else fails, I'll just segway into ""Sermon"" by David Mamet, which I suppose is a kind of speech. That'll wake them up. Okay. Back to work."

"event","Well, I am breaking my weekly vigil a week early because tomorrow I'm going on a ""Magical Mystery Tour"" (the title is somewhat dryly humerous) with the history and Latin teachers as my excursion for the Work/Activities period. I have no idea what's going on, but the tour lasts from eight to five, and when I get home I have to pack for solo (and find my compass and maps. Eek!) which we leave for on Sunday. Four days alone...I'm very much looking forward to that. Apparently this week is notorious for mental breakdowns. I'm keeping my head (unless you count the day I got a letter from my dad), but I'm a wee bit stressed what with a spanish quiz, an in-class history essay and a math test today. 

Thank you all for the information, it was much appreciated. Congradulations to Jill and (I doubt you're reading), Sebastian and Fehr and Nate and whoever else is in it. What's the freshman's name? 

There is a paper birch tree outside my window that my roomate Ashley says looks like it has faces in it. She's absolutely right. It looks like there are several pointy-nosed moustached men gazing haughtily into the boys dorm on the left and the woods on the right. When it's warm and our windows are open, we can hear the boys screaming and playing radios and guitars and quoting ""Zoolander"" (It seems to follow me). And there is a fire-escape out the window by my bed which we can climb onto to talk to them, and ""study"" between windows. I just have to be careful not to be naked in full view of the entire boys dorm, which is very possible.

Well, now I have to go to science, where we're going on a hike to look at some abandoned beaver dams. I hope you're all well. All my love.

Oh, and P.S. I'll be home on October 11-13. I'd like to see some/all of you!"

The smells and the resins are on my hands, my working hands I know could be sliced off in seconds with the instrument I'm using. But I am not afraid, though I was. It's so gentle with the wood, guiding it where it needs to go and when it falls it falls gently with its fellows on the concrete. My arms are warm and capable from sawing. I glide my finger along the cut, so smooth it feels as if it has always been there. The through tenon, the mortise, are my children and the wall beam my progeny. My partner cuts too deep and I am upset, strangely, because it matters. We are cautious not only because it must fit together with the other beams and braces but because the wood lives and breathes with you, is you. Craftsmanship is a powerful thing, as is pride, and as (interestingly enough) is our beam. 

No the Mountain School has not made me sappy about most things, but honestly, I love barn work. There is more to come. I figure I'll write about one small aspect of my life on my weekly foray into the world of technology. Maybe you'll write back to this, since I don't seem to be getting much mail from you guys. I hope you're well. I'm doing most excellently."

Certainly not I, at least not on a regular basis. And now, because I have nothing else to say, I will enlighten you by printing a short story from the anthology Micro Fiction:

But What Was Her Name?
by Dawn Raffel

She was born in December in Baraboo or thereabouts- small, still blue, a girl, and, by some trick of oxygen, alive. She lived to marry late. She bore live descendants. 
See her in the pantry, a knife in the hand, a mother of sons, a baster of ribs, of scraps. There is a knot at the throat. There is a vision of something.
The groom wears wool.
The bride grows thick.
She holds her breath.
Years pass.
She is ripping a lining, draining a steampot, simmering blood. She is sinew and elbow, gnarled in a chair. Her feet are red. A man she has raised delivers a slipper. Look at him! he wears the groom's robe.
Her fingerbone will not release the ring.
""Father?"" she says.
She sees her breath.
She was white in the bed of her birth. The past had taken hold of her- the heart's last sleight.

Tremendous, huh? God, it tears at my heart."

You know, right before I travel I get this strange empty excited feeling in my stomach. I had it today as I was filling my cup with ice. This was as the biscuits were being devoured, early in the morning (relatively speaking). I absolutely love getting up early in the morning. It reminds me of Vermont (if it's summer, which, fortunately, it is). I felt so alive this morning. Then I feel asleep for two hours in the car going to a guitar lesson and during my brothers lesson. That was refreshing. 

I feel...like I am about to grow ten feet. I still havn't fully realized the fact that I will be traveling tomorrow. I brought lots of reading and music and a journal, because hopefully if I've learned anything this year, it is how to write frequently. Hmmm...we shall see. So I will have a real journal, like with pen and paper. Crazy, I know. Hopefully I'll learn a lot and see a lot of cool stuff. I'm getting excited now. Now that I have to go to sleep, of course. Well, I need to do some last-minute packing.

It's based on a play called Hospitality Suite, so it's pretty contained, but it's SO the best acting I have seen in a long long long long time. Wow. And the script kicks so much ass. Why is it I always fall in love with the plays with no women in them? Ugh, guys get all the best parts. SEE THIS MOVIE!

I made a Key Lime Pie today. It's still chilling (the thing takes three frickin' hours). I feel like such a home-ec gal. But yeah, I make pie. Well, now I have. We'll have to see how it turns out. I don't like condensed milk at all, so I won't be able to forget that image while I'm eating it, but hopefully the lime will block the gooey milky taste. Gross. It's also kinda gross because it calls for lime zest (no surprise, right?), but because I used store bought limes (picky picky), which I think look darker than Key Limes, there are all these dark green goobers in the filling. I'm sorry, I'm making it sound gross. I hope it tastes better than it looks.

Seriously, it's like laughing at a joke, I can't help it. But now it's moving into more serious territory. My favorite piece for today was how one person ""flowered; flowered from vanity, ambition, idealism, passion, loneliness, courage, laziness, the usual seeds"", which I think is adolescence in a nutshell.

Anyhow, I don't have much to throw on this table. It was just a quiet, pleasant day. Ever notice how time gets both slower and faster outside of school (or work or whatever). The days go by so individually. Like individual drops of water (Whoa now, that one's never been used), but the minutes and hours themselves-don't really drag-but they kind of...glide like syrup. Really sticky. So that's my observation for today. I know it's not original, but I'm just warming up."

I feel wonderfully interested. It's the best feeling, being engaged in something. Feeling the desire to go out and explore my potential and to learn more. I just went out to Borders as a study break and bought three books recommended to me by Ms. Thompson: Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce, and Swann's Way by Marcel Proust. I hope I can get through these things. No, actually, I will definitely get through these things because I have a mind to. Literature and writing has become for me what acting once was. I need more. It is difficult, however, because this takes a lot more self-discipline, which is something I don't really excel in. I guess I'll have to learn. Yay learning. It's sad because on the one hand I cannot wait to absorb knowledge, but then when I turn around and see my history book, I want to puke. It's an amazingly repellent quality that I'm experiencing.

Mmm...I had a delightful afternoon. I came home and challenged my brother to a game of tennis. So we rode down to the courts, and it's warm and sunny and humid and I LOVE SUMMER and so we begin to warm up. And since he's been playing all spring and I havn't for several months, of course I'm rusty. So he makes this comment like ""So Gwen, I see you're having problems with these lobs,"" and I decide right then and there to whoop his ass. And I tell him so. I can practically see the kids' ears shrivel at the pool next to the courts. We spin, and I win, so I choose the court with less sun and he serves first. Well, unbeknownst to me, his serve has gained a whole lot of speed. So he wins the first set. And now I'm scared, cause see, my brother has never beaten me. Ever. So I set my jaw and focus, and win the thing six to one. Ahh...now I can breathe again. My pride always pulls through. Ugh, sometimes I sicken myself. And then I go home and take a shower, and now my muscles are all warm and tingly and I feel all clean and good and can I just say again that I LOVE SUMMER! I cannot wait to just have the days to go outside and PLAY. Tennis, swimming, bikeriding, just being outside. Of couse I'm thinking of this now when I have to stay inside to study.

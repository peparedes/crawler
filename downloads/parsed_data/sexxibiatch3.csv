and by then everyone was already out so i just went to bed..

saturday..me amanda and andy went shopping bc i wanted to buy a cute outfit..so we went downtown..and i bought a shirt it took me like 2 hours to pick 1 shirt lol..theas so much thea
then i need pants and i didnt see any thea that i liked so we went to the mall..but be 4 the mall we went to eat tacos..lol
they were yummy!!
after that we went to warwick mall..and i bought pants at macys thea cute..
then we went to visit waffle and her baby..oh my god hes the cutest baby ive ever seen..ooo i want him..lol
so we chilled thea for a lil while then andy had to go to work for 7 so we left thea and dropped andy off at his house
so he could go to work..and me and amanda went back to her house so we could get ready!!
i straightend my hair..well she did it!! and then we got ready
her and luch were goin to tha club..i was gonna go to alans but he was tired so he went to sleep..so around 10 we went to wendys to visit andy and get some free food!!:)
and then they took me home around 11:30 and i watched movies with my brother! fun fun..lol


""john""
ur not even worth my time anymore..
you said you loved me and that was a lie,
you said you'd never cheat on me and that was a lie,
you said you'd always be thea when i needed you that was a lie
you said you didnt love her and that was a lie,
you said we'll always be together and that was a lie,
you said i dont even talk to that bitch anymore that was a lie
*do you see a pattern here* lol :)

ne ways ur not worth me gettin upset..bc i know theas someone out thea that wont do all the shit you've done to me..
and it might take me a while to find him..but when i do i'll be happier then ive ever been!!!

*~some advice~*
just because ur havin his ""kid""
doesnt mean u have to be with him..
if you think that hes gonna be faithful to you
your crazy..if i was you i would deff
want my babys father in my life,
but you dont have to keep hurtin yourself
you know he lies about everything..and its not good
for u or your baby to be so stressed out..
so if i was you..id move on to bigger and better things
because you know he'll never change..for anyone!!
and my bad about callin u the other day but
i was just pissed bc he tells me he loves me and then
you were pickin up his phone..
and he said that he didnt know you were givin him hickeys
he said he was sleepin wil you were doin it..
and i was just upset that he lies about everything!!
so i have no problem with u..my problem is only with him!!!"

anyways..when he got outta work..we drove around and talked i told him i couldnt talk to him anymore..cuz all those nasty ass hickeys on his neck..so he was chasin me tellin me that he cant let me go..and hes sorry :( and he loves me so much
he doesnt want to see me with another guy..
bc it will hurt him too much..and he doesnt want me chillin with other guys.. he said he cant be with me right now bc of this fuckin kid..(which prob isnt his..lol) 
but i kept tellin him that i cant talk to him..and its better
if we dont talk..he said it will be so hard not talkin to me everyday!! :( oooo..poor john!! lmao
anyways around 2 i wanted him to take me home..
but i didnt have the keys to my house, so i was gonna sleep
ova loris..but john said he would rather me sleep ova
his house..:)
so we went thea and we layed down together..and told each other how much we love each other..and then we held each other all night loong..:) he said it felt so good to hold me
in his arms
then we woke up in the morning and had sex..yupp thats right meg we had sex..so i guess those hickeys didnt work bitch..

him at some resturant near alans house..and then we took a ride, and we sat in a parkin lot and talked, then he decided to take my cell phone and leave..so i had to walk to get lori so that i could use her phone to call..him at first he wasnt tellin me where he was..and then
a half hour later i met him at newport creamry..he said he was just tryin to have funn..anyways then i got in his car and he was gonna take me home but we ended up in another parking lot and we talked thea
then around 2 we came to my house but we drove right by..lol we went to the park near my house and talked some more..then around 7 we were done talkin because we were gettin tired..so we came to my house and feel asleep :) we woke up at 1 because he had to be to work for 1:30.

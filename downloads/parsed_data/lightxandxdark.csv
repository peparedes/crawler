"event","It's interesting being on your own completely...flying alone was an adventure. I'm not going to lie, I honestly doubted whether I would survive. As the plane took off I got this horrible sinking feeling and began regretting not having a chance to say goodbye to people and not having told most people how important they were to me. I contemplated sending text messages, but then I feared screwing up the plane with my blackberry. So I just decided there was nothing I could do, so I went to sleep. Maneuvering the airport with two GIANT suitcases and my laptop wheelie and duffel bag was a challenge in and of itself. Ha. The consequence of packing too much (and until the last minute...I packed from like 9pm to 8am hah) oh well. It was good practice. Now I know what and what not to do...
I met the cutest little english boy! His name is robbie and he's 13 but he's adorable and I want to take him home with me and make him my brother haha
Well have a great summer everyone!"

"event","sitting in my bed (on my mom's laptop--mine's broken AGAIN) i was hearing these strange noises that sounded like a cross between those obnoxious trash cans being dragged up someones driveway, and jets flying into van nuys airport (my room is under their flight path) and because its like 2am i realized that it cant be either of these (no one is awake now except me--because all my neighbors are in their 70's, and the airport has restrictions) i couldnt figure out what these noises could be, until right now when i just realized that it was supposed to rain tonight...

<b><i><u>ITS THUNDERING</b></i></u>

thats so exciting.

anyway-christmas was different this year, it didnt have the same ""magic"" i guess now that i'm older, and i did the majority of the gift buying, but that was a lot of fun.  my mom and i saved the christmas spirit for a bunch of small children at the mall on christmas eve when we went to take our annual christmas picture with santa (arent i a little old for this? haha) and they closed off the line without telling anyone thus denying about 30 families who had been waiting in line the opportunity to take a picture with santa which made me angry so i went to the concierge at the mall and complained and long story short, they took the children's pictures.  it was nice to see how happy the children were when they realized that they would still be able to take the picture with santa.  as i told the guy at the concierge, i may not beleive in santa anymore, but those children do, and i know if i were their age and was denied taking a picture with santa it would break my heart, and i couldnt sit back and watch that happen to 30 or so kids.  
also-i didnt fall asleep during midnight mass (i have every year thus far), and i actually enjoyed it...i came back home afterwards and wrapped presents while my parents slept.  i brought the christmas tree into the house on christmas afternoon, and i decorated it.  it was almost as though the roles had been reversed.  my dad and i watched football christmas morning, and my mom attempted to understand what was going on and what the point was.  nevertheless, even though i didnt open my first present until 11:59 on christmas, i didnt care. i had a great day. and hey-i made off with a bunch of stuff this year, and i technically got my first gift about 2 weeks ago (my chrome rims).  anyway this year i got a coach watch and keychain, ruby earrings, an external harddrive for my (dead) laptop, a navigation system, a couple of sweaters, the 2 josh groban cd's, 2 calendars and the entertainment weekly with greys anatomy on the cover (and the promise of the calendar when it becomes available again) and a set of dolls (these were more for my mom than for me...haha)

i <b>NEED</b> to finish my 20930238203840387 college apps and supplements. like now. but procrastination is so much more fun...oh and aparently my SAT essay wasn't as bad as i had thought it was...i got an 11...but i still didnt meet my goal for sections...oh well. im not taking the sat ever again, theres nothing i can do about it now.

i can't wait for 2007...so much is going to happen this year and im really excited...this is the year i get into 
(and rejected from) college, the year i enroll in college, the year i graduate from high school, the year i turn 18, the year i move out of the house, the year i go off to college and live on my own.  2007 is the year i officially become an adult, and while i'm scared, im also REALLY excited. i hope 2007 holds as many excitements as 2006 held disappointmets.  not to say that 2006 was a horrible year, but it wasnt the best. i hope 2007 is amazing.

here's to 2007."

sometimes i just marvel at the idiocracy of some people. now, im usually not some pro-nature, keep everything as is type person, but it angers me if people throw their trash out of their cars, or trash campsites, the beach, or whatever. however, something about people throwing trash out of their cars really sends me off a cliff. i cant stand it when people throw stuff out of their cars, and i usually give them a ""piece of my mind"" when i see it (and its possible, and im not afraid for my life). and of course, the point of all of that was that i saw this happen today. i pulled into the bank of america in tarzana and as im about to turn to park i see these two about 20 year old women in a silver SUV either a saturn or a nissan throw a juice bottle out of their car at a green landrover parked as theyre backing out of their parking spot, so as i pull around to the parking area because i got kind of angry about that, i overshot a bit and ended up in the middle of the driving area, and they pulled forward and blocked me so that i couldnt move out of their way and gave me this horribly dirty look like if i was the trash they had just thrown out their window, and as my anger level was rising, my rationality level was dropping, so i flashed an equally dirty look back. and waited for them to do something, when i realized this was useless, i turned my wheel sharply and moved slightly out of their way, but only far enough i could ""give them a piece of my mind"" and the first thing that came to my mind was ""keep your trash inside of your own car!"" said in a pretty angry tone, and aparently they were a lot more proactive than i had thought, and they threw 2 plastic cups at my car, scratching it, which of course, sent me over the edge, and it took me a good 10 minutes to calm down. certain people just piss me off.

then certain peoples flacid amoeba-like arguements and faulty support for their arguements really makes me want to make them <i>see</i> their ignorance. like someone on the radio who claimed that the three major wars of the century were the gulf war, the cold war, and the war on terror. completely neglecting that the two world wars ever occurred, and when the radio show host tried to show this to her, she basically told him he was ignorant and wrong and that her theory has been proven in many newspapers, yet was unable to produce the names of these innumerable newspapers. 

a few instances of stupidity that sends me clear over the edge.

also, today i was blatantly hit on by a 74 year old man with his wife at the vet. mind you, his wife was 20 years younger, but had so much botox and collagen in her face that she looked at least 80. he was also telling me to make sure that i find a guy with a sense of humor, that he was friends with the ""hot"" guy in school, but he would get all the ""hot chicks"" because they would realize that it was him talking, that they would use him to get them in the car, and that its easier to get a girl in bed with a sense of humor, then being serious, then came the oh so familiar question: ""what do you do?"" to which i responded with ""oh im still in high school"" and his whole expression changed, and he goes ""now thats how a man can get himself into trouble...with a pretty girl like you, id hate to be a highschool teacher having pretty girls like you coming in my class"" the only way i could respond to this was with a nervous laugh, so he continues ""so how old <i>are</i> you? and since i was with my mom, and i felt safe, i said 16 and he was like, ""wow, i remember 16 year olds to be little skinny girls with pigtails..."" *nervous laughter* to which he responds with, ""i thought you were a model, youre so beautiful and mature"" meanwhile im trying to ignore the fact that hes clearly coming on to me, and just focus on the cuteness of his adorable puppy while his wife and my mom talked about pet insurance and exercising or whatever...i dont know whether to be flattered, or disgusted...im feeling quite a bit of both however...

so, i leave tomorrow for the entire summer...this is my address...send lots of letters, cards, care packages, and most importantly birthday presents!!! (coughjuly25cough) haha

they were not directed at anyone, but rather at myself, that i was mad at myself for breaking down, and for letting everyone down. ive always been really hard on myself, and i get really upset with myself when i make mistakes. i really appreciate all the help everyone has been giving me, and i will continue to work on it, until i get it down. yesterday i was really stressed out and when i get like that, i cant handle making mistakes and i get upset and kinda...no. REALLY bitchy. those entries were written after my dad basically interrogated me on the game and what happened exactly, and it just made me relive it all, but in a distorted way. today looking back on it, i made stupid mistakes, but yesterday i overreacted.

After her night feeding, she started vomiting so much that I, myself, began shaking out of fear for her. It was a mother's nightmare. She had no control over it and despite her cries, she kept on going. It's like her tummy had a mind of its own. It was hell.<BR><BR>Throughout the night, she kept vomiting at least every 20 minutes. I tried to re-feed her with milk or even water but she kept throwing it all out. I called my aunt, who's also her pediatrician and we were advised to give her Pedialyte 45 and Plasyl to rehydrate immediately. Jovy rushed to the nearest pharmacy and we medicated her as quickly as we could. She hardly slept through the night. I stayed up myself. I was scared for my little girl. She looked really helpless and vulnerable. The glow in her eyes was gone. <BR><BR>The next day, when no signs of improvement were visible, we rushed her to the hospital. She already had high fever and started with LBM. She's dehydrated and there was no choice but to put an IV bag on her. At the ER, Jovy left me at her bedside because he didn't want to hear her cry out in pain when the IV is inserted in her vein. I had no choice but to be the stronger parent but inside, I was shaking and scared. I almost threw up at the nurse because I got dizzy with the smell of the hospital and fear. Luckily, the nurse was good to successfully put her IV with just one try. We were at the hospital for three days and family and friends were there to show concern to our little girl. <BR><BR>She's doing better. After 6 dextrose bags, color has returned on her skin. No longer pale, quiet and in pain, we can now hear her giggle once in a while. <BR><BR>Thank God that we didn't have to spend the new year there. She still has a mild case of lbm but better. Her kuya Jed said that Gabie's better now. She will be.<BR><BR>May the new year bring her better health and no more worries for us.

Kids nowadays are different to when my generation was in high school.&nbsp; Girls are more open to early relationships, premarital sex and my goodness, I don't want him to make a mistake and make me an aunt.&nbsp; I would hate the girl <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">forever</span>!!!

We all freaked out, yes, but we love him and we only want what's best for him even if he thinks that we're being selfish.&nbsp; He may hate us now but he'll realize that we don't want him to go astray.&nbsp; I don't want my parents' sacrifices to be for nothing.&nbsp; He's young, he'll have plenty of girls to love but not now.&nbsp; He has to remain focused on his end goal -- a good education at least.&nbsp; <br><br>Our dad said that he doesn't mind if he won't finish school but who wants to be the great disappointment in the family?&nbsp; I'm sure that he wouldn't want to be the child who ruined his future.&nbsp; Sure, we're over-reacting... we're still his family and he can't get rid of us.<br><br>I really don't care if the girl gets heartbroken.

Last Friday (Nov 9), I met up with some of my high school batch mates for a mini-reunion at Fontana Villas and Leisure Park. I received a Friendster message from Cynthia, one of the organizers.  I asked hubby if he'd let me attend and if he'd like to join.  He was okay with it since he knows that I've been pretty much cooped up here in the house.  Plus, there was no other choice but to go with me because Gabie will definitely be with me.

Anyway, we were there at 4PM and there were only a couple of people around but by 6PM, you can't drop a needle in the villa.  Happy shrieks everywhere.  Old friends seeing each other again, after so many years.  It was fun watching from the sidelines.  I just listened mostly to chikahan and enjoyed the company of old, familiar faces.  

We may have aged in number but I don't think anybody changed -- in weight, maybe. Haha.  Like me, some brought their kids and I'm not talking about toddlers but school-aged girls.  Some have kids as old as 10 but there's one who joined us in all her pregnant glory.  

Hubby and I got teased because we were high school sweethearts.  They were talking about crushes and asked who my love team was in school and I said that I only had one and I married him.  Hehe.  I even kidded that they jinxed me from having a baby because of the ""chismis"" that spread false information of my pregnancy.  

Anyway, it was an overnight get-together but we (my family) left at around 10PM.  The rest stayed for more chikahan, booze and picture-taking! Hopefully, we can do this again and there will be more people joining us.

I checked all the toys that my Gabie had been exposed to and the rest that are still in storage.&nbsp; Most are Made in China products.&nbsp; Gabie will never play with some of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />***<br /><br />Most of you know that I'm a breastfeeding mommy and recently Wyeth has also ordered a recall on some of their baby formulas.&nbsp; Thank God, I didn't have to worry about this issue but my sister-in-law did.&nbsp; She's no longer feeding her daughter with Promil Gold.&nbsp; Why take the risk in continuing with the product even if the lot that she's got on stock aren't affected,&nbsp;would you?"

<lj-cut>
On the eve of the release date of J.K. Rowling's last Harry Potter book, I got depressed. I wasn't able to reserve myself a copy of the book.  I planned to but I couldn't get myself to justifying a P1300 spending on a book now that I'm a mother.  On July 21, I avoided the news whether on TV or the Internet.  I didn't want to see the hysteria over Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. But of course, I lost the battle.  Every channel (local or cable) covered it and so my inggit came to an all-time high.  I was restless the whole day.  I even went to search for torrent files particularly on the audiobook version.  I found the files but I couldn't be satisfied.  I want THE BOOK. I want to smell the ink on new paper.  Feel the pages as I turn them. Stop and put it down when I want to give myself a good cry over a wonderful chapter or hasten my reading when I can't wait for the next page.  In the previous books, I intentionally did not sleep until I was done reading.  I welcomed my insomnia.

On the day after (July 22), I asked hubby to buy me a copy. I think I kind of begged.  I saw a copy of the book which my sis-in-law borrowed from her friend.  I was jumping in frustration.  I didn't know that I would feel this way over a book. Hubby didn't hesitate.  He even asked me why I didn't order it in the first place. I told him that I didn't want to misspend money. He just gave me a weird look.  Off we went to National Bookstore at SM Pampanga.  I grabbed myself a copy while I was holding my baby and even whispered to her that someday she will read Harry Potter.  At the cashier line, I got goosebumps while I waited for my turn to pay.  My love for this series is so intense.  

What's weird, though, is the fact that I still haven't opened the book.  The plastic cover is still intact.  I dread to start reading and getting to the last page.  It's hard to accept that this is the final book of the Harry Potter series.  No more adventures and misadventures from Harry, Ron and Hermione but the magic goes on as the books get passed on.  I'm going to make sure that my copies are going to be well-kept so when my Gabie is old enough to read, understand and enjoy the books, she can have them and she can experience the magic on her own."

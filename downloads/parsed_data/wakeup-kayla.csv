"event","Just heard the leak of the first single from Weezer's untitled seventh album. Not real impressed, but it could've been worse. Weezer keeps re-inventing themselves and it's sort of this on-again, off-again relationship I have with them. Give me blue, green, Pinkerton and yeah, sure, even the red album. Keep Maladroit (though I'm on the fence about that adorable ""Keep Fishin"" video), and you know what?, just go ahead and burn that Make Believe bullshit. Weezer is comfort food for my ears, so I kind of cross my fingers for them each time, yaknow?

And it's not that I missed you, because I didn't, and I don't. It's because I'm used to you. You're the only thing I'll keep because I'm comfortable. What I said about never coming back to you? I lied and I'm sorry. You're cute and you do nothing but shut the fuck up and listen. More people should follow in your footsteps.

Like who they're dating, what they're doing, where they are or even where they're headed. A lot of my social frustration is in the department of seeing my friends make (once again, in my opinion) poor decisions.
I mean, I think I'm being a fair friend by letting them handle it themselves and even supporting them. I think I'm being a fair friend by also staying true to myself and saying, ""I love you man, but the fuck?""

Ratatat in 20 days and Funk Night a few days after that. I am excited for Funk Night to finally happen. Every single time, my ride/friend flakes out last minute and I end up bitter and bratty. Friday night, I was the drunkest I've been in years. I was loud and rude and dancing my little heart out. All of my friends played hero when I hermit'd on the staircase to try to stop the spins from intensifying. Not my proudest action, but was real fun nonetheless. I made some art and am starting my clothing website next week, hopefully up and running by the end of the month. Monnaaaayyy $$$$$

I was in Ann Arbor this weekend for Rock for Daftuar. It was actually a lot of fun. I wasn't so sure how comfortable I would feel drinking in such a large city at a house party doubling as a show where I planned on knowing, oh, three people? (Those three people being the friends/band I traveled with that would be playing.) Come to find out, I ran into people I haven't seen in almost 2 years! Old friends from all over Michigan, it was absolutely wild. (I never realized how many people moved to/around Ann Arbor!) Once comfortable, I downed two sparks, a pabst and basically made myself at home on top of Josh's car when I wasn't spilling myself over the porch kicking my boots over people's heads below. I spent the vast majority of my night with Dustin, Lauren and Casey (None of whom I have seen in FOREVER!) I lost my phone (twice!) but managed to find it on the next door neighbors porch. I rekindled old friendships with people whom I used to care immensely about (Maybe crushing on future art hipsters who would be ""too cool for school"" wasn't exactly my strongpoint...) and making new, awesome friends with people who shared a mutual friend with me. I will admit, I was only impressed with a few bands (and I'll admit, I only paid attention to two of them.) but it was entirely too much fun. I was two blocks from downtown, so I took a few walks and made a few calls before my phone died, and finally ended up back in Mt. Pleasant by 7AM!"

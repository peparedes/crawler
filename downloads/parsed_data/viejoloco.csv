every three hours.

For the other two hours and fifty-five minutes, he's more along these lines:

What you see here used to be an orderly stack of papers, but is now a goddamn mess, and I couldn't clean it up, because he wanted to play, and cleaning up is what you do when he doesn't want to play (see picture above).

Left to his own devices, he will drag everything smaller than him under the couch to add to his little nest. Any attempt to, say, retrieve my car keys from this nest will be met with claws, teeth, and large amounts of not fun."

"event","Ok, this post is going to be walking a thin line. I'll try not to get too emo on it. If you don't like bad news, skip to the last bit, which is about kittens.

Between drinking far too much, doing too much, and running the AC on minimum to keep the bills down, I'm not doing well. Not to mention my friends thought I was having a heart attack the other day and almost dragged me to the emergency room. Great job if they did, since I'm currently uninsured except optical and catastrophic injury (which only counts if it's in my car).

Anyway, reasons for all this: My parents were both in and out of the hospital for the last two months. A lot. My mom passed away last month. My dad's in a nursing home now.

Then I get laid off at work. Yeah, I hate my boss, he's retarded, the place is, hands down, the most comically incompetent workplace in the western hemisphere. But it was also good money, which I now don't have.

Then my niece breaks her leg. She's a brat and a spoiled princess on the best of days, but this was just her ticket to sympathy gifts. She's perfectly able of walking with crutches - when no other option presented itself and I couldn't carry her ass downstairs, she made it with no trouble. When her parents aren't watching, she hops around the room playing with the cats and the dog. When her parents are watching, she whines and moans and screeches if you even think about brushing against her cast. It's a bit draining, and I've only been helping out four hours a day.

Monday this week, my niece's brother (from a different father, so no blood relation to me) found a kitten in a garbage can while he was out trash picking the night before trash day. Madison whined and cried until her mom agreed to find it a home, and then I somehow - I can only assume mind control was involved - agreed. I'm in the house alone, so some logical break in my head thought a kitten was the solution.

Took her to a humane society clinic - they didn't do much, but explained nutrition and other care, and sexed the kitten. Assured me she was female, which is good news - females don't spray and are much less likely to be aggressive as adults, so you can wait longer to get them fixed. Estimated she's between 4 and 6 weeks old, probably not old enough to be taken from her mother, and definitely not old enough to be put in the trash. She cried constantly for about two days, and barely ate. Damn she had some lungs on her, too - constant screeching like some sort of primal bird of prey.

So I named her Freya after some consideration. Today, I got suspicious myself. I don't know much about cats, but I know my way around a human female, and Freya wasn't looking very female. Took her to the clinic again, and sure enough, she's male - brining the suggestion that I have him fixed ASAP and declawed sooner than planned.

After this little switcheroo, Freya needed a new name. Wife of Odin and mother of a quarter of the Norse pantheon doesn't work for a male. There was only one obvious choice, though.

Loki. Trickster demon, thief, hermaphrodite, father of Hel, mother of Fenrir. Freya fit the bill pretty well, and since he'd only been called Freya for two days, it worked out just fine to start calling him Loki.

He earns the name, too. He also earns the name Stupid, which I briefly considered making official before Loki came to mind. He has a talent for finding things that shouldn't be here. He's produced two matchbox cars from god-knows-where, they must have been stuck under the radiator for nigh on fifteen years. He finds it greatly amusing to be well behaved and not walk on the keyboard when I'm working, but to lay across it and play with my mouse (causing god knows what kind of havoc as dozens of random clicks and key combos register at once) as soon as I look away.

Yesterday, he tried to jump into the room on the other side of the TV. THUNK! He also fell in his water dish. Freaked the hell out, ran under the couch, locked the claws on all four feet into the underside of the cushions, and absolutely refused to let go and come out for an hour. Maybe the TV run in will teach him not to worry about the other cat he keeps fighting with in of the brass kick plate on the kitchen door. My ""favorite"" event so far: I came home on the 4th to find kleenex EVERYWHERE. Every room of the house, on the floors, the furniture, up on shelves I know for a fact Loki's too small to climb to. ""Her"" name was still Freya then. ""Freya... Where are you?"" He pokes his head out of a kleenex box he'd torn the plastic off of and pried open from the end and looks around like he owns the place."

""Yeah, the neighbors are super nice and the landlord even lets us have small pets.""
Now the door opens and four cats are sitting there. One of them has a good go at clawing my legs apart, but thankfully had been declawed.
""Oh, uh... yeah, I see you have cats.""
""Yep! I have five!""
""I... I only see four.""
""Oh, no no. My favorite's over here, isn't that right Alexander?""

See, cats I don't mind. Four cats is pushing it. The ashes of a fifth cat in an urn on the coffee table just about pegs it, but addressing this cat by name and professing to love it more than the four rolling underfoot... I have a high tolerance for crazy. That was it, right there."

Dropped a week's pay on it and some games. Since Zelda for the DS doesn't come out until October, I got Spectrobes and Pokemon to satisfy my notorious obsessive-compulsive collection behavior in games (When I mentioned I was using these games as Zelda substitutes, I was asked ""What the hell kind of substitute has you putting rock cocaine in your coffee?"" The good kind.), and New Super Mario Brothers because it's awesome like that.

Also grabbed Phoenix Wright: Justice for All from the bargain box. Funnest game I've played in a while, even though it's cheesier than a Laurel and Hardy movie. It does raise an important question: What the FUCK kind of prosecutor brings a whip to court? How the hell am I supposed to cross examine that shit?"

"event","Not sure exactly what to make of this but...

I went through one of the ungodly huge piles of audiotapes my grandmother accumulated over the years. Unbelievable piles, phone conversations with relatives, Christmas mornings, birthday dinners, even one box that includes audio recordings of various episodes of MacGuiver and M*A*S*H before she got a VCR.

A bit was pretty interesting, though. Apparently, when I was a year old, my mother had an astrological reading done for me, and recorded the whole thing - three tapes, front and back. This is the first I've known of it. Pretty amusing stuff. Almost solid hilarity.

The first ten minutes is almost solidly talking about how I was going to grow to be a very religious and meditative person, deeply spiritual, shunning of creature comforts, never taking poisons into my body. In the lot, she was right in saying I would likely leave the Catholic faith, but she was very wrong in saying I would most likely become Buddhist or Hindu. Other than one half-hit, the rest of it was a lark. ""Meditative"" maybe - I'm pretty good at meditation, but it's mostly an exercise in ignoring people, and has involved little soul searching. Definitely not shunning of creature comfort, as I type this on a creature comfort connected to a global creature comfort, sitting on a nice leather creature comfort and watching reruns on another creature comfort. Oh, and that whole thing about poisons? I was taking poisons into my body while listening to the tape. Just about choked on my rum when that part came up.

It goes on and on, always very amusing. It gets into the woman troubles I'd have in my life. While I have woman troubles, they sure as hell aren't the ones in the tape. Purity of body came up again. Yeah, right. That only lasted as long as I was unable to get a date. I'd marry at a very young age, and my mother would hate her. I'm 24 now, which I don't think is ""very young"" anymore, and I'm certainly not getting married any time soon. The reader suggests that she not interfere. This is the exact OPPOSITE problem I've had - when my mother isn't asking me if I'm gay and assuring me she'd ""take me to that school to get fixed"" if I was, she's trying to hook me up with random women she meets in public whose names she doesn't know.

Further discussion of the mystery woman who never materialized gets into some weird shit about tribes that I barely understand, but she sums it up that I'd probably marry a black girl. While certainly not an impossibility, her reasoning doesn't jive, as she describes some sort of bizarre New Ageish stuff, and describes this girl as the sort of loony I lose patience for very quickly.

Getting into my talents, it talks about my artistic and athletic prowess. lol. With a capitol LOL. I'd never have a grasp for words or speaking, but I'd be fit and strong, and would have a powerful talent for art, sculpture, and possibly gardening. I've been called a lot of things, but I've never been accused of being fit nor strong.

Reality check: I'm virtually colorblind - the most interesting thing I ever said at an art gallery was, ""Is that French?"" The cactus I used to have on my desk <i>dried out and died</i>. I've successfully neglected the most hardy and unkillable plants into derelict soil and if my lawn weren't overrun with some freak strain of grass that can't be killed and never grows more than two inches long, I'd've killed the lawn long ago. The only thing that grows in my yard is Rose of Sharon. And if you've ever grown Rose of Sharon, you CAN'T KILL IT. EVER. If you can kill it, please come and kill mine. I planted one that I got from a cutting, and it's spread through the entire lawn, growing up through cracks in the pavement, in the middle of the lawn. There's even one sprouting in the muck in the gutters. Occasionally neighbors or family have said, ""Oh, those are beautiful plants, do you think I could have one?"" and I dig up forty or fifty saplings for them - in some parts of the yard, I can dig up five of them in one shovelful large enough to produce flowers within a year of transplanting. Lastly, and now this might sound slightly conceited - because it is just a bit - but I like to think my grasp of words is self evident.

The same part gets into my play activities as a (then future) child. Encouraged my mom not to buy ""specific"" toys like soldiers or cars. Instead she should give me blocks and other ""imaginative"" toys. Now, as evidenced by the fact that most of them are still in boxes in the basement or attic, my favorite toys generally involved cars, robots, robots that turned into cars, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Not blocks. Even now, overly abstracted video games fail to hold my attention (For example, try as I might, I can rarely keep attention focused on any card-based video game).

I also would never have an analytical or problem solving brain. I'd struggle at math (which after the hard sciences was always my best subject), have difficulty with even simple mechanical tasks (considering that this was made 23 years ago, I think my computer experience can be considered this), and when confronted with puzzles or questions would withdraw and wait for somebody else to figure it out. This last bit is one of my favorites, since while I get annoyed with puzzles, I'll usually break them before running away, and I never leave a question unanswered, even if I have to slap some Grade A Home Made Michigan Bullshit on it.

And this is only tape one.

Edit: Listened to about five minutes of tape 2, which was made three years later according to the date on it. Gets into past life stuff. Pretty crazy stuff here. The life described sounds the first chapter of Dune. I guess in a past life, I was Paul Atreides, and this guy named Scott from my day care that's mentioned several times I guess would have been Feyd-Rautha Rabban. I'd much rather be Duncan Idaho.

Why did I buy a lot of bricks, you say? I didn't. I didn't order them, nobody is doing work on my house that requires them. They just drove up in a truck, lowered three stacks onto the driveway, and left. Didn't ask me to sign for them, didn't tell me who they were for, didn't even ring the doorbell. By the time I got my shoes on to go out and yell at them (and I'd come up with some real zingers while I fumbled with the laces), they were gone.

I spent a good chunk of the day after work going to every house in the neighborhood with similar brickwork to mine. None of them needed a ton of bricks, and none of them seemed to wanted to take them anyway.

So far, I've found a dwarf fighter who wants to be a monk. Talking to him about it, he sounds exactly like those WOW players who want to be warlocks. He has absolutely no concept of what a monk does or how, but he lost a brawl with one once and thinks they're the most unbeatable fighters ever. Then there's the rogue who, for some ungodly reason, specializes in two handed weapons. Note: Sneak attack doesn't work with a damn claymore. 

And, true to 90% of ""I'm shadow, so I can't heal"" priests I ran into in my WoW career, the only cleric I've found so far is evil, so she hardly has any healing spells, and judging from her stats, I think she meant to roll a bard. Clerics shouldn't look  like this: STR 11, DEX 11, CON 12, INT 14, WIS 13, CHA 21. Twenty one. Charisma. That's supposed to be a dump stat.

At least the game does seem to be more in line with the BG style than the first Neverwinter Nights. And they put a bit more love into the dialog - get waylaid by bandits, and you get about a dozen different options - beat them up, scare them away, pay them and run, but my favorite: ""[Bluff] Does the patrol chasing us have to pay the toll too?"" and (if you succeed) the bandits pack up and run, leaving all the toll money they collected behind."

Kid's not bad at hiding it, too - system32's a great place to hide it from computer illiterate parents, but the tech guy will find it every time.

I was back out there two more times last night and this afternoon - same browser hijack again. They were starting to think I didn't actually fix the problem. So, I ask the kid if he used Firefox, and he says, ""No, it didn't have yahoo on it.""

"event","Saginaw has more than it's fair share of far-right Christians, nearly all of whom are convinced the world is going to end SOON! VERY SOON! REPENT! ETCETERA!

One of which, a reverend of some sort, likes to hang out in the left turn lanes of busy intersections handing out newsletters and tracts and so forth. Today he was handing out one about how Halloween and Roger Khan not being elected mean that Saginaw will feel God's wrath SOON! He stands in the street running around blocking traffic and shoving papers in every open window he finds.

So now I should point out that my car has crappy heating. This time of year, the only way to keep the temperature to a manageable level inside is to crack the window and turn the heat up to the second little tick mark on the dial.

Anyway, I get stopped at the Reveren'd intersection today, and he shoves a newspaper through my window and starts asking if I'm saved. I roll my window right up, not really caring that doing so jammed his paper in there (I planned to roll the window back down and throw it out as soon as the light changed).

He stood there saying ""If you reject the word of the LEAST of God's great messengers, you reject GOD! Are you not saved?! A hethen you are if you silence me!""

He didn't realize until I started to drive away - and neither did I - that the sleeve of his trench coat was closed in my window. I still have the button!

However, he probably has a point. Tigers in the world series, the Saginaw Spirit actually winning two games in one season, and this nutjob playing in traffic for over a year without getting run over by a truck - pretty good signs that the end really is near."

Esther's one of the dirty and violent books though, and the trailor has a lot of sword fights. The movie also has Omar Sharif, who was pretty good in Hidalgo.

On a related note: Dr. Bashir. Don't remember the name of the actor who played him back on Deep Space Nine, but seriously, what is it with him and playing Arab characters lately? First Kingdom of Heaven, and now this. Seriously, he's whiter than ME."

"event","I seem to be a curse. Every guild I join or want to join falls into chaos.

Right now, my server's in a state simmilar to what happened on Feathermoon when Hand of the Forsaken finally collapsed - fallout and drama imported with new recruits destroyed all three of the guilds that broke off from Hand, and even wrecked a bunch of the smaller guilds.

Anyway, fast forward to this year, on Scarlet Crusade. TEB, the guild I've been with since those first clumsy trash pulls in MC to killing Vaelastrazs and Ragnaros, collapsed from an internal pressure that's been tehre for a long time, and finally exploded.

Anyway, Kaizen formed out of the ashes of TEB (As did a smaller, non-raiding guild). Kaizen did amazing things in it's first two weeks of life - we killed Jin'do the Hexxer, General Rajaxx, Moam, Buru the Gorger, and Ayamis the Hunter - all bosses TEB never succeeded against. We also greatly refined our strategies on Baron Geddon and other bosses that TEB had unneccessary problems on.

Then Kaizen died. Our top priest joined a BWL guild, and nobody else even seemed to start a panic.

Anyway, I applied to a few guilds. Tried SA, the guild our priest joined, and then their leader and two other officers left the guild. I took the lack of replies to my application as ""fuck off"" and applied to a couple other BWL guilds (One of which I'm not hopeful about, since it's not actually a BWL guild but a Naxxramas guild).

At least it seems that SA is holding together. I got an invite to come along on a green dragon raid with them - Ysondre, they think. But they thought it was Taerar last time, and were shocked and amazed when a minute into combat they realized it was Lethon. Just our luck some unheard of glitch will spawn Azuregos at a green dragon spot somehow."

It's for a small web design firm. But, it's not web design. What did they call it? ""Advanced Dynamic eCommerce Solutions for Growing Businesses?"" Something like that. I can't call it web design, but that IS what the place does.

Yeah, so it's a web design firm. Sort of. They do a sort of bolt-together erector set web design, putting a bunch of modular parts together and throwing a stylesheet over the whole lot. Whatever, web design. This is one of those things where if people knew how little work was actually involved, they'd buy the company instead of the product.

 My job description primarily involves office maintainance, domain registration, and assembling databases, which are likewise pretty much modular constructions based on what the client bought. My plan for the first day of work is to set up a series of SQL scripts that will do all my DB work for me, so I can slack off all day.

The downside of this is that it requires me to find a SFW passtime that looks sufficiently like work to get away with this."

I've fallen in love with my PS2 ever since I revived it from my ill fated attempt to rig a stock IDE hard drive to it, and I've been looking at the PS3 occasionally, and I'm not at all impressed. $600? And talk of that being a BASIC unit? I could get a 360 core unit, a Wii, and a Wii for the TV in the other room for that much, and I don't WANT a Wii, and that's only partly because it's called Wii.

Since Sony has said they're losing money on it even at this price, and the company's in a rough spot as it is, I'm thinking: What can they do to improve the console's chances against much cheaper consoles?

I've figured it out. I've figured out how Sony can win the console war: STOP TALKING. Just SHUT UP. ""5 million Americans will buy it, no matter how much it costs, and even if it doesn't have any games."" ""I'm thinking it might be too cheap. After all, gas is close to $3 a gallon, and you don't get thousands of hours of fun out of a gallon of gas!"" Seriously - you have the fanboy advantage, but calling them mindless drones who would buy a camel if you painted PS4 on the side is not helping.

You're not helping. You're not convincing me. Stop talking. Microsoft is basically advertising the Wii, saying you can get a 360, a Wii, and two games for each and still save $50 over a PS3 - Nintendo said almost the same thing at E3. Think about that: Your two biggest rivals are suggesting you buy BOTH of their consoles instead of ONE of yours. That's below the damn belt. It would be just plain unfair business practice if it weren't for the fact that Sony hasn't put a muzzel on their dumbass CEO. ""I think people WANT to pay more for things,"" indeed."

Hehe, tough job on that I'll tell you. Took me about 15 minutes - would have been faster if I hadn't gone all out and blown my mana early, or if I had potions, bandages, just about any healing (I actually harvested some dreamfoil in the middle of the fight and used it to mix up a major mana potion while he was on fear).

I have fought harder fights (Hederine Manastalkers, Duskwing, Felguard Elites and Doomguard Commanders). Borelgore was easy compared to some of the stuff I've done, but the screenshot at the end is much more impressive. Borelgore is HUGE. And for reference, the loot you see from him? Sold for about 6 silver. Less than I could get killing a random ghoul with two shadowbolts. Definitely not a profitable venture.

Also, I'll be puting up some pictures of my other recent acheivment - my guild downed the first boss in Blackwing Lair tonight, Razorgore the Untamed. Crazy intense fight. It starts out with him and three orcs. You kill the orcs, then use an orb to mind control the dragon.

HOE-LEE-SHIT does it change from there. Orcs and dragonkin running everywhere, four separate unit leaders shouting different orders and confusing everybody involved, and just six kinds of crazy shit going down. I've never seen something that intense before in the time I've played WoW. I had a blast teaming up with the other warlock and just circling the room playing seek-and-destroy with orc mages.

Unlike Borelgore, Razorgore dropped decent loot. Over 3g each between 40 people, Bloodfang Bracers, Judgmenet Bracers, and some hunter trinket that a lot of people ZOMG'd over but which honestly sucks only slightly less than the vendor trash warlock trinket (which I will probably still drop 150 dkp on because I love shiny things)."

The least useless cleric I could find comes along, and spends half his time whining that we're not saving one damsel in distress, and as soon as we start, he gets mad because we're not saving some OTHER damsel in distress. Halfawy through saving one of them, the game drops into a dialog box, ""False friend! Betrayer most foul! Pray our paths to not cross again.""

The zero point DKP system that Deathwalk and their allies (Flying Axe included) use is, theoretically, more fair than usual DKP systems, the theory is dependent on actually getting drops - not wiping on Lucifron seven times a week and then getting Cenarion stuff.

I waitlisted for two different lab sections on bio 111. One of them is earlier than I like, the other conflicts with CSC 477. I'll probably end up keeping the early one, which will be a pain, because it'll cut a huge block out of the study/Churchill's deadzone I built into each day of my schedule."

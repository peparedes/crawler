"event","Wow, I haven't written in this LJ for quite some time.  Hmmmm, let's see.  I'm still in Afghanistan after 10 months, I pre-ordered a 2009 BMW 335i, I met the gorgeous Kelly Hu and Maria Menounos, I'm still in Afghanistan...whoops, it's starting to get pretty damn hot over here...AGAIN, and I can't wait to go back to Germany so I can resume my life again.  Oh, and California is still the no. 1 state in the Union, hands down.....I said hands down, jackass!

"event","Wow, it's been quite sometime since I've Lj'd it.  

Well well well, I'm on my second combat tour and am currently at Jalalabad, Afghanistan, where one can take a shower simply by walking, and the sun beats down on your face like Rocky Balboa in 'Rocky Balboa'.  I have raccoon eyes now.

I'm the acting commander of my unit over here and it's fun (but not too much fun).  I've become really jaded about the Army so far, so I'm thinking about switching branches, either to Field Artillery or apply for Psycological Ops or Civil Affairs, both of which fall into Special Operations Force (SOF).  

I've been deployed from Germany for a little over a month now and it seems like time is moving on to my liking.  I'll hit that 15-month mark in no time!  Oh, how depressing.  I work long hours, and by the time I get to my tent, I'm pretty tired.  I always doze off when I try to read or do some studying.

Things I like about this deployment.  The food is free, good, and all I can eat/drink.  The pay is pretty good, and go straight to my $$savings$$.  Anda...that's about it.

I miss life in Germany so much.  The people, language, food, beer, beer, beer, beer, and night liiiiiiife.  Sigh.

I'm scheduled to go on leave in Jan.  Would anyone like to go to Vegas during that time?  

Well I have to go back...and sweat some more.

I've said it once and I'll say it again.  I love living in Europe.  Money is definitely well spent on traveling.  St. Paddy's day was so fun.  I met a lot of people, acquired a love for Guinness - and drank much of it, experienced some bizarre weather (winds, sleet, hail, snow, sunshine), bought A LOT of stuff, to include this excellent painting from the Museum of Art, and so much more.

I visited my new unit today in Bamberg and met my new company commander and talked about our operations in Afghanistan and what I'd be doing.  I'll be the Executive Officer (XO) for A Company/173rd Support Battalion (Airborne).  That means I'm second in command of the company!  Fresh!

I got back from Iraq in December and will be going back to war in spring.  That's only five months back in garrison.  Haha.  My life is crazy.  

AHEM!  Dublin for St. Patrick's Day!  I Just wanted to throw that out there again.

"event","Sorry LJ, you've been much neglected...

I've been back for about a month now I've been doing practically NOTHING at work.  I've Just been sitting behind my desk, talking with my NCOIC, shooting the shit with others, and practice writing with my right hand on my desk calender.  Yeah, can write (print and cursive) with my right hand once again and so now I am ambidextrous! 

As far as the social scene goes, well...I've been doing quite well.  I've went out with some of my German friends and had a great time drinking and dancing at the clubs downtown.  I spent X-Mas with my friends family, and It was interesting and fun!  I thought I was going to feel uncomfortable, me being a Buddhist and never ever celebrating X-Mas, but it was most pleasant and festive!

For New Years Eve. I flew to London with friends for four days.  It was by far the best NYE, beating Amsterdam last year hands down!  It was my first time in London and I loved all the sights and people, but not their exchange rate.  I even saved a young toddler from certain death.  Oh yes, that I did.  Can you believe that all the pubs were closed on the night of NYE?  We couldn't get behind that! And so we were all pissed that we couldn't get our alcohol.  BUT, we did have a bottle of wine and sparkling wine.  We were across from the eye of London and watched the countdown as it was projected on the building adjacent to the eye.  It counted down from 60, and I believe I counted all 60 numbers in German.  What came after the clock struck 1200 was truly wonderful.  I bore witness to the greatest fireworks spectacle ever!  Well, at least the greatest I've seen.  The show turned the night into day and I was going crazy!  By this time we were done with the wine and were now drinking the sparkling wine.  After that, it was just celebration with people, yelling ""Happy New Years!"" and ""God Save the Queen!"" to everyone and anyone.  My friend Ashley was helping me not to go astray, because I was just walking up to random groups of people and doin' my thing...mostly dancing.  The pubs were now open and so continued our libation consumption while chatting' it up with the Brits.  I guess it goes without saying I threw up that night.  

A day after I then flew to Italy to visit my friend and his family in Vicenza.  We visited Venice and Verona.  In the first few hours I was in Vicenza, I bought 350 euros worth of nice antique-style furniture.  I also bought some cool stuff in Venice.  I got to see the Church that was in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade!  That was a real plus for me because of the love the Indiana Jones films.  I knew I was going to see it someday.  Shoot, I've been withdrawing money out of the ATM, Gelbautomat, Bancomat, in unprecedented amounts.  It's a good thing I have much in my savings account so that I can cannabalize on my checking acccount.

This past weekend, was spent in Garmisch, which is in Bavaria, bordering Austria.  I went to see the Neuschwanstein castle, which the Disney castle is modeled after, and I went snowboarding...on my birthday!  Yay, I'm 25!  I carved up the slopes of the Bavarian Alps with friends, ate Goulasch in bread, and drank cappucino.  The cappucino was cold in 20 seconds.  Yeah, t was cold...very cold, with bursts of insane cold winds.  It was even more cold when we went to the Zugspitze, which is the highest mountain in Germany.  It was -8 degrees C, or 13 degrees F.  

The drive back to Heidelberg was better than the drive to Garmisch.  It was less boring for some reason.  I was rippin' it up on the autobahn, too!  For the most part I was going around 80-100mph, with some long stretches at 115mph.  I'm gonna go for 120 soon enough. 

When I first got back from Iraq I was like, ""Yeah, I guess I'm glad I'm back in Germany,"" but now I can say with confidence, ""F* yeah, I'm glad to be back, I love Europe!""

Today I met up with Represenative Gary Miller for a little meeting, then saw my old ROTC battalion commander at CSUF.  Got home and changed then went to David's in Costa Mesa where I ate my first In N Out in over 8 months with David, Lisa, and Evan.  Got back to their place, shot the shit for a while then David, Evan, and I went to this one restaraunt and got some drinks while watching the Angels game.  Got back to his place and watched Harold and Kumar, shot the shit some more and called it a day.  Great day actually.  

I'm still in shock being back in Orange County.  I guess I never realized how many beautiful people live here.  After traveling across the nation and the different parts of the world, nothing can really compare to this place.  I love it and I miss it so.  I hope someday I can live in OC again.

The day after I came home I hung out with Brian and Matt at the Spectrum and ate at this place called Javiers...I think.  Good food.

The 48 hours traveling back to LA from Baghdad was almost a nightmare.  There was a time where I was like, ""This is bullshit, I don't want to go back to CA anymore.""

Still got lots of people to meet up with and more drinks to consume.

"event","With the U.S. Armed Forces death toll exceeding 2,500, the death of Abu Musad Al Zarqawi, and the two missing soldiers from the ""Triangle of Death,"" the issue of a redeployment timetable was struck down by Congress for a second time.  The people have said we cannot destroy the insurgency, and with Zarqawi's successor now known, the fight might seem a perpetual one.  But before redeploying troops, a stable and confident transition must be made between our two countries.  And so I must agree with Pres. Bush that, ""Pulling out of Iraq would make the world a more dangerous place, it's bad policy.""  It's bad message relayed to other nations, such as Russia and North Korean, on their views on our resolve.  We must not be myopic.

We should stay the course and complete the mission we started three years ago.  We should quell the insurgencies as much as possible and complete the training of Iraqi Ground Forces so they can take control of all their military divisions, keeping them self sustained for the fight.  It's been debated on whether we started this war under legitimate reasons or pretenses, but that's not what we should be arguing about! The time is now and we cannot leave a ""half-finished Democratic product.""  After the war is officially over and we have all our troops home, then we can analyze and probe on the issue, but now is not the time.  

If a solid timetable was established and they said we'd be withdrawing in a year or so, I'd be happy!  But there isn't, and so we must do what is required of us. Deployment rotations are every three years.  Meaning, for a standard three year tour at a duty station, you are to deploy one of those years and spend the other two at home station, whether that be in Germany for me, or Virginia, Georgia, Arizona, et cetera.  Personally, I shall do what is required of me as a member of the Armed Forces.  If I am to return on subsequent tours then so be it.  Why?  Because that's my job!  During a time of war, my job is to help win those wars.  However, I do not have a family to call my own, as many other people do.  In fact, upon redeployment I hope to transfer to a new unit, and if it turns out they are to deploy within the coming year, I would be all for it.  

But many people do not have certain values that MOST members of the armed forces have, to comprehend my position."

I ran it in 42:10, but I could have ran is fast because towards the last 1/2 mile I developed a HUGE side stitch that slowed me down tremendously. 

Now I've never considered myself a runner.  I only ran because the Army required me to pass a PT test, so I strived to do my best, which is a 12:40 min 2-mile so far.  We have many fun runs here so I think I'll start participating in more of them.  There is a 7.2 mile in June and 1/2 marathon and full marathon down the road.  I think I'll train up for that as well.  As weird as it sounds, it is fun.  Makes you feel especially good at the end of the run, too!  Totally energized.

"event","Without immigration, we couldn't possibly be where we are now. A melting pot of great citizens (for the most part) that have brought about our countries security, prosperity, innovation...hmmm world dominance?  We have welcomed so many and have benefited tremendousley.  However, immigrants coming in ILLEGALLY is where it stops.  

It is one thing to be a welcoming country, but we must uphold the laws that make this country function fairly.  I also support Sen. Clintons (I think it was her) bill of fining the employers of illegal immigrants and anyone who aides them.

So people say, ""Well, illegal immigrants do a lot of jobs that others aren't willing to do.""  Well, those jobs will eventually get filled.  It is best to provide ""undesirable"" jobs to those who have none.  Beggers can't be chosers, right?  By employing only American citizens, we will also be decreasing unemployment rates, and...possibly decrease the number of homeless people? Perhaps.

Bottom line, one should go through the legal processes to naturalization.  To come to this country illegaly is like someone cutting in front of you in a queue without you knowing.  It's not fair to those waiting and it's not fair to this country.

Would it hinder relationships with our friends to the South?  Most likely, but we cannot sacrifice this countries legal system, it's purity of deserving citizens, for political friendship ties.  It's chaotic. 

I can sympathize with their plight, but you can't have just anyone coming in this country as they please.

We had three power outages today at the Palace.  It's pretty annoying.  I always see the lights flicker in here and hope that it doesn't completely shut off.  Just imagine the power being cut off to a whole palace.  It SUCKS.  This one actually affected the whole complex of Camp Victory.

I said I wasn't going to buy anything serious over here in Iraq, but I caved in.  Off eBay I bought the Canon 1d Mark II N.  I've been wanting the 1d Mark II for a long time, and now they have the N model.  I now have the money, so why not? I still need to get some memory cards, but all in all I'm slappin' down $4,000.  I can't wait till I slap down...a lot of money, for my BMW 3 series!

A couple of weeks ago we had a barrage of mortars/IEDs/rockets through out the week and it was just crazy/annoying/scary.  Things have calmed down a lot.  This morning I heard a fire fight in the distance with a loud ass bang.  It looks like...overall...things aren't really getting better over here.

10 more months to goooO! How depressing.  I'm looking at August for my R&R.  Isn't that when CA is its hottest?  Shoot.  The sketters are definitely coming out now and it's almost disgusting.  They are in clouds...or clumps in the air, so I wear eye protection everytime I go out.

I'm most likely going to another unit after I come back, so that means I'll probably get deployed again, IF that unit hasen't already gone.  I hoooope not!  So how is everyone?"

The smell of weed was everywhere and it was Heinekin after Heinekin that night.  Fireworks of every kind were being blasted on the ground and in the air.  It was a very festive night.

Today I went to get information on a BMW 325.  I'm gonna test drive one on  Wednesday to confiirm my fancy for it.  And then in 9 months I shall custom order one and get it upon my return from the sandbox.

The drive up there was hell with all the snow and rain, or yeah, and getting lost three times.  The ride back was much faster.  Oh, and I got a speeding ticket right next to my work, and I was only on the road for like five minutes.  The damn camera went off and I was like, ""Wow, that just ruined my whole trip.""  But I got over it pretty fast.  It's not like it's going on my DMV record. At least I don't think it will.

It's cool going 100+mph on the Authobahn.  I was cruisin at 120 for a while...woooooweee.  Contrary to popular belief, there are speed limits on the Authobahn.  When there isn't a speed limit cars just freakin gun it like nothing.  The zones between limits and no limits change quickly so it's always slow, then super fast, then slow real fast. Kind of annoying at times.

"event","Greetings friends,

I'm at Fort Benning, Georiga right now and I just completed my basic airborne training yesterday!  For those who aren't familiar with the airborne, it involves soldiers jumping out of a perfectly good airplane in groups of 20-30 in a mass exit, at 1,250 above ground level at around 135 knotts deploying parachutes after 4 seconds of free fall to the ground ready for combat.  There is nothing like it, it's marvelous!  I completed the required 5 jumps and now I have my long awaited (2 years) silver jump wings.  My grandfather has his aviator wings, my father has his airborne wings, and now I have a set of wings myself, finally.  The school was for 3 weeks consisting of a ground week, tower week, and jump week.  

Basically, airborne school wasn't the easy school everybody makes it out to be.  I was apart of Delta Company and it is the roughest toughest company of the whole battalion.  We did the most pushups, flutter kicks, PLFs (parachute landing falls)...just more of everything.  It was hell actually and there were times I wanted to quit, but that was just unacceptable for me.  

So my family and Rev. Haemond came to see my final jump and graduation so that was great.  Since I'm going straight to Germany after this I proobably won't see them or anyone for a long time...I'm gonna get packing now and so the next time I write in this will be at my duty station in Heidelberg, Germany.

Heres a picture of one of our exits and one of my sister and I.  Look at those killer silver jump wings on my chest. Wooooowe.

I graduated OBC last Friday and now I'm here back in CA until next Saturday. OBC was awesome, learned so much, and made so many awesome friends.

On Monday I had lunch at Mimi's Cafe with lovely Christy. Picked up my father from the airport and had great Korean food. Tonight I had dinner with Nolan, David, Keleigh, Dax, Evan, Jay, Josh, Lauren, Fin, Aer, and Jaime. It was wonderful seeing the ol' gang and having fine sparkling red wine...and beef. 

Today I also went to the DMV and got my license renewed. Since it expires more than 60 days from now I had to take a written test. I failed the first one with -6 and passed the second time with -3 (the max). Service is relatively fast at the Norco DMV, fo SHO. I also went to Mens Wearhouse to use my 50 dollar gift certificate. With that I was able to buy a pair of cufflinks, a pink pocket square, a cedar hanger, and a garmet bag. Sweeet.

At home I've just been squaring away my household goods and what not to prepare for my PCS (Permanent Change of Station) to Germany, and I really don't have a lot of things to ship.

The rest of the week is just filled with lunches and dinners with friends and family.

I go back to Fort Lee for two more weeks to blackbird (working odd jobs), then to Fort Benning, GA for Airborne school for three weeks, then off to Heidelberg, Germany for three years. 

All right, Cut and print."

"event","So I'm at Fort Lee. I've been here since the 16th. The trek over here was good overall...I guess. There were good days and there were bad days. I almost got into three accidents (non of my doing) on the 2nd day, anda...got a speeding ticket in West Virginia on the 4th day! Amazing, huh?  Let's see, Arizona or Burger King people are weird looking, Oklahoma City's freeway system is jacked up, Illinois reminded me of So Cal, and you better not mess with Texas because they are strict on traffic laws and litter. 

My room is adequately nice, no complaints here. I have my pictures placed, including my Burberry girls on top of my TV furniture. iBook and printer set up with...ahem...dial-up. But hey, it's better than nothing, right? I have a coat/hat rack next to my door so I have my service cap, PCs, beret, and fedora on them.  

Today I just signed in, ate breakfast at Shoneys (I saw them all over my trip). Talked to Chung who is at Fort Eustis right now for the Transportation Officer Basic Course (TOBC) and I finally got a hold of Erin and talked to her for a spell, so that was nice. I'm watching INTO the WEST on TNT right now and I think it's a really good series. Ya'll should watch it. The weather isn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's...kind of hot and humid, but tolerable. I'm sure it'll get worse as the months progress, but for the time being I like it. 

I get pretty good service up here on my cell phone so if you want to call me you can. Just remember that I'm 3 hrs ahead. And If anyone wants to send me mail heres my address:

Afterwards, I went to Los Al and bought a Gerber for my dad for Father's Day, afterwards I went to Best Buy and picked out the things I needed for VA with Russ. I later went back to school and picked up my letter of recommendation from Dr. Joyce's office. Then I went to BJs and meet up with David and just talked before we put our names in.  

Tonight was my going away dinner at BJs. All who attended included, Josh, Luaren, Griffen (baby), Jesse, Chris, Travis, Christy, Keleigh, Lisa, David, Torie, Dax, Evan, Nolan, and Cheryl. It was a splendid dinner and I'm so happy on the turnout. The only person who coudln't make it was unfortunately Erin, but I will be having lunch with her tomorrow. I am sooooooo gratefull and happy to have such great friends who care about me. Towards the end, I did make a toast to all my friends. I played with Griffen and it was cute. He kept on throwing his plastic book and toy car to the left side. Well, after dinner we just basically shot the shit and all left. At the end it was just David and I. ""And there were only two left.""

Well, that's the end of that chapter I suppose. I really won't see anybody for the next 3 months, unless I attend Josh and Lauren's wedding, which I sure hope to make. I plan on leaving early Monday morning headed towards Virginia...2,700 miles....by myself. All right, time to watch the Simpsons, gute nacht.

Afterwards, Erin and I went to eat at the Gypsy Den. We both got a little too much food for our appetite. We played Scrable at her place and she beat me by 50ish points. 

We then went to my house and Erin did some stuff on the computer and my dad asked her like 20 questions. Haha. We watched two episodes of the Simpsons and Family Guy and some Desperate Househives. I took a picture of her for her myspace and she was somewhat satisfied with it.

"event","Yesterday I went to The Get Up Kids show at the LA House of Blues with Christy and Keleigh. It was their last show in CA before they broke up and it was amazing.

The girls came to my house and then we watched a scene from Return of the Jedi. They met Wolf and he was barking no doubt. Later it seemed like he was warming up to Christy, but then Keleigh did something and then he started getting crazy again. 

On our way there we had great conversations about...oooh...drinking, throwing up. We had some Rilo Kiley on and Christy was making her own lyrics up and one of them was ""Keleigh has no friends"" and it was sooooo perfect, it went right with the music! It was hi larious! 

When we got there we ate dinner inside the restaurant. I had the Chicken fried chicken and it was great. Since Christy knew the manager there he gave us VIP bracelets. There I also met Keleigh's friend Aaron. Afterwards we ate we got queue for the show and then went through a medal detector. It was like going to the airport. Last time I was there (2 yrs ago with The Get Up Kids and Hot Rod Circuit) it was just like ""all right all right, get in"" and they didn't even look at my ticket. So we got in and went upstairs to the balcony to watch Limbeck. They were awesome, but I wished they played Racine...maybe I wasn't there when they played it. Afterwards Christy's friend gave us another wristband, this one was for the Foundation room upstairs. Now I had three wristbands! Wow, I've never had more than one! I got my TnT and then we went downstairs to the VIP section to get ready for the Get Up Kids. It was a great area where we could dance freely without other people around us. 

So the Get Up Kids played every awesome song possible! There were only two I didn't know which was from their latest, but they still sounded good. I ordered a beer somewhere in there. It was a great night filled with singing and dancing! They had two encores and during the last one I was dancing on one of the tall chairs and Nano the security guard pulled me down, but it was cooooo. My voice was just about gone after that show. 

After the show we went to the Foundation and into...PRINCE'S ROOM. Yes, Prince. He wasn't there but it was his regular room and we felt...important. Haha. We didn't stay long though because we were tired so we jammed out of there and...waited for my car. It was the HOB valet and so there was a long queue. Oh man, there was this girl who threw up and tried to catch it with her hands! How horrid! Who the hell does that? What, did she think she wasn't going to throw up a lot? Man, I bet her hands smelled like shit after that. There were a lot of people who just backed away. It smelled too and her puddle was making a trail down the street. So yeah it took a while to get my car. Limbeck was packing away their things in the van and I gave them all a big hug. One of them recognized me as the guy dancing on the chair, right on!

So we drive home I get gas for meine auto and then that was the end of that chapter."

Afterwards, we got dressed and went to Claim Jumpers for dinner and then saw the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg Don Juan and Moliere. It was beautiful, sensual, and spectacular! Never a dull moment!

"event","Today was my official last day of school at California State University, Fullerton. Sad. I only had one final and it went all right. In class we got an <a href=""http://www.npach.org"" window=_blank>NPACH<a/> as a gift for doing an IMC plan for their company. 

Afterwards Christy called me and went to eat lunch, actually she ate while I drank, at that one Mexican place next to the Exxon gas station on Nutwood.

So that's it. I just have to wait till Sunday comes around for the commencement ceremony. Wow...5 years gone by, time sure goes by fast. Well, it sure has been an excellent and memorable experience, one that I will cherrish forever.

Now, ""we're sending you back...to the future!"""

"event","awards ceremony on friday. so many changes to the script i almost lost my cool. but it turned out well. i got my 2. afterwards we went to lampost as usual. i ate some pizza, then we went to that one place where i bought cathy a drink for her bday. locked my keys in my car, maya came and saved me. i got my class ring, too. It's sweeeeet. People can now kiss my ring like I'm the emperor of...let's say Austria. later that night i went to see dusty rhodes at lampost. i was way early so i just talked with andrea for a while. then went to erins, i got iced coffe at diedrichs and then we went to the show. we saw jay and jewles, although not together. 

I changed my oil today and didn't make a mess like I did last time. but...i changed it with exxon oil. i had no choice! I was pleased that Erin called me today. I was even more pleased to get a voice message from my sister saying that she saw episode III, loved it, and now wants to see all the other star war films. finally! i've waited for this day for a long time! now brother and sister can converse about star wars!  The rest of the day I just melted. And now I'm tired because of the heat. 

""so then i says to mabel, i says, i'll finish this later""   i know now!"

"event","What a fantastic day it was...all with the exception of me messing up my back again due to a faulty dive off a 5 meter diving board.

Yesterday was our Army ROTC Dining Out with Erin at the Queen Mary. The drive to the Queen Mary took a while because 1) There was a good deal of traffic and 2)It took us forever to find the 710 off the 5. We ended up arriving a little early and so after some introductions we went up to the observation bar. I got us our usual, Tanqueray and tonic and cranberry and vodka. Those drinks went pretty fast so then we got our second round, Erin with her C&V and I got a Makers Mark Manhatten. Ski, Church and some others came, intro intro. We all went down to the Ball room and got a table. On our way we saw Cicchelli and Kaivan. At the table it was Ski, Church, Oki, Lee, and me along with our dates. Oki's date, Ashley was a right on and she actually knew friends of Erins including Andy. Before everything started we went outside so Erin could smoke a fag and we saw Sergeant C outside taking pictures with his wife. So we're shooting the shit and right then something happened. A question was asked in the most peculiar way and an agreement was established. 

The receiving line was the first thing and so we all had to go outside then come back in with proper introductions. When the invocation was happening Erin and I just looked at each other. Ahhhh. 17 toasts followed afterwards and some of us had our spirits in plastic cups and were drinking that instead of our water. I made the 2nd toast to the United States Army. The food started coming out starting with the salad. Since Erin is LI, she had to get a new salad sans cheese. When our guest speaker was talking I felt that nobody was really listening to him because so many of us were drunk already and we were kind of raising our raise a bit, well, at least our table was. Questions for the Chief were asked from pre-arranged letters so that was a bit weird. We went up to the bar again and Cicchelli asked for a gin and tonic so I got it for him  and so he got me one later. Erin and I went outside so she could smoke her fags and there were others 3 floors up calling my name all drunk like. It was funny. After dinner, we danced...yes. Benny was calling me out! He was a pretty good breakdancer in his days but he claims he's too old now. But anyways, so he did some stuff like windmills and crabs and so I had to respond and the battles started. Mind you, I'm drunk and I'm going to breakdance. It was somewhat difficult but I came out the victor among the others. I was surprised to see Jack out there. Yeah, it was basically an Asian thing. 

After Dining Out we went with Oki and Ashley to a bar next to one of Ashley's friends appt. On the way there Erin and I were singing to the Get Up Kids and all was well. At the bar we ordered some New Castles and there was this black guy who we were talking to and he was very impressed that I could tie a bow tie. Like he was reaaally impressed. So Erin told him that I was definitely a good dresser and that I have four suits and then the guy said ""Ah ry, but what about music?"" She replied with ""I'm still trying to save him on that."" Haha, we basically listen to the same music. So we all sat next to this group of girls. Erin and this Canadian guy left to smoke so it was Oki, Ash and I talkin it up. It occured to me that we (Oki and I) weren't allowed in there because you're not allowed to be in uniform at a place that strictly sells alcohol. So I drank Erin's beer and we left. Now...where was Erin? We didn't know where she was! We spent some time looking for her and finally did. Uhg. So we're about to all leave and Oki is really concerned with me driving home. To cap the night I had 3 Gin and Tonics, 3 Manhattens + a swig from another source, and 2 beers. But I assured him that I could make it. So we're driving back to her place and I'm mad at her. I was sooo worried about her. Anyways, I'm going 85-90 all the home and in the middle Erin said ""Uhh, Albert, you're really fast."" She told me the following morning that she was pretty scared and that I was on a mission to kill us. So we get home, Erin can't find her keys so I crawl through the bathroom window and let her in. Right way I brush my teeth and she cooks up some breakfast. HAHA. Erin gives me a glass of water and I slept in Jaimes room.

Next morning I wake up with yes...a hangover. Damn. I find Jessica looking gorgeous in this 1950's looking ensemble and I told her about last night and IT. Erin came in said ""Why were you so mad at me last night?!""   I told her that I was worried about her and she said she was really sorry. So Lauren came over to pick up Jesse. We went outside to see Josh and Fin. That baby boy is a giant now! Very cute. We both left a little while and THAT is the end of that wonderful chapter.

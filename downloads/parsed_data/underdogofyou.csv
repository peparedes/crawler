"event","Wow, i surely havent updated in a while... apologies my friends. I'm still with my beloved James, or gremlin. Blah, i hate it when people call him gremlin, hes not gremlin, hes james, damnit! Anywho... just finished finals this week, but started new college classes, lotsa homework. But its fun. I'm enrolled in Child Devolopment 116 and Anthropology. Both interests of what i feel i might go into when i grow up. haha.

Dance auditions/practices for fame have been this week. i tell you, i have busted my ass, and apparently some people can tell. Terri and Rachel both said i stood out and me mum said she could tell i was tryin hard. I love the dance, its awesome. Im hoping to get a dancing female role. Lead role. Or larger role. I am sore as all hell. I finally got my right splits... i havent attempted them since monday though because i have been so sore from doing them among other things. 

Thats all for now. Comments make the world go round."

"event","I cant believe it. This very starry nite, i was proposed to by James Anderson. 
To begin at the beginning, today was glorious. I called him after church, he came over, we ate, then we went to his house. We went into the basement and watched Rundown together. He sat on the floor with me rather then in the chair because he wanted to be with me. He claimed he couldnt not hold me. i told him to go to sleep and he said he didnt want to not have me in his arms. then i threatened to go home and he tried to sleep lol. then we went upstairs, and watched 50 first dates on the couch. We finally had our first make out session. Twice. Very quick ones though. I still enjoyed them. His kisses are so wonderful. Hes gotton to be a lot better kisser... or maybe hes just more comfortable with kissing and has relaxed. Ya kno how they talk about how when you get that kiss with that special somone that you get that feeling? Ya kno, the one where you get this feeling of contentment after it happens? I GOT THAT. I HAVE NEVER GOTTON THAT. i actually spent quite a few minutes after the kiss contemplating how it felt. you cant wait for the next one. i craved it for gods sakes. ive never craved a kiss. Then the lights went out. I know, a odd twist to the story, but dont worry no sex involved. we actually both got scared. he got a bad feeling and didnt know what to do, but it went away once the fire truck went by. probably a line went down or something, his whole block was in the dark. it was scary. zombie-movie- story. so we left and went to my house. then we stayed in my room, laying on our tummies, his arm around mine, staring at each other. Just staring at each other. Into each others eyes and smiling. We didnt have to say a word. I wasnt quite sure what to do. I always wanted somone to stare at me with that look like i'm this amazing person they cant NOT look at. i wanted to be seen at this beautiful person who has done so much. He gave me that look, like i ment something, like he couldnt tear his eyes away from me. i liked it, but at the same time, i couldnt not talk. i wasnt sure what to do. im not used to that. i loved just looking into each others eyes... just thinking about our future together. a bit later, i said i love you, he said i love you more, i said prove it, and boom he asked the question: will you marry me? I said yes, and sat there stunned... then we hugged and stayed in each others arms for a while, letting it settle in. we were smiling like idiots. We talked about a lot of things .who to tell and all. I already told my parents, and on christmas eve we are telling his father and Jeff. His mother... we arent going to tell quite yet. We dont intend to get married for another 4 or 5 years, so we have time. On christmas he is giving me this irish ring, the one with the hands, heart and crown. Its green in teh center, which is ironic because green is my favorite color and we are both very irish. And it stands for love, friendship and loyalty. Which is needed in a relationship. so thats our pre-engagement ring, until he can afford our real engagement, official engagement ring. Which shouldnt be that long because its just a white gold band with an engraving of perfect love and perfect trust. No stones or anything. I intend to have anna and hilary and roxy for sure in the wedding, possibly my mother. I'm not quite sure, i would like terri in it, and i would like ariel to be in it, but i dont want to have too many people, i just want 2 bridesmaids and one maid of honor. we shall see how things go. i'm engaged. thats that. i'm engaged. Its amazing. i told mum and dad and they said congrats... i think they were expecting it. they didnt act much different. Just asked how it happened and if i loved him and stuff. which of course i do. i believe i am still stunned. very excited nonetheless. i apologize for rambling on about him... but for gods sakes i'm engaged!!!! guys, i'm ENGAGED!!!"

"event","Life has been okay for me lately. My bad bout with anxiety has ceased, so now i'm better. I still have to train myself to get over it though, which is tough toadies. But i'm a tough cookie, i can take it. 
So.... yesterday, i didnt go to school, due to a christmas party i had to throw over at Jefferson. It was so fun. Lotsa stuff they did too. Then i went to Seans, and called James. He came over Seans and we hung out there for a bit. Then we went out to eat, at this irish pub, then went to a celtic concert called findarra's wren. It was fun. I found out something interesting. James always plays with this heart ring i wear on my pointer finger, i asked him why, and he said it was because if it was a year from now, he loves me so much, that he would propose at that very minute. Then he said he was thinking will you marry me. Which is ironic considering i was thinking about how much i wanted to marry him. This whole love aspect of life is so very odd. it's so mushy gushy, and to others its disgusting until you actually fall in love. Then it is so beautiful and sweet. You dont give a damn about anything. I'm so happy i'm unstuck over logan. I still think about him everyday. But usually not in a good way lmao. Nah, i cant say that, i usually just think about something that will remind me of him and something we did together... considering we did spend a year and a half together. But james is SO much better. He has ambition. He has determination. He knows where he wants to go, and hes striving to get to it. There are sooooo many qualities that logan lacked that James has. Important ones at that. But enough about loooveeeee.
I'm supposed to hang out with quite a few people over break. Terri and Rachel for Yule, they will probably spend the nite, and Amber and her baby morgan, Annie, Allie for yule... another celebration, and a few others. Derek is supposed to come over to give me my gift, and so's Carly. This will be a fun break. and considering i know steve-o always reads my journal- I LOVE YOU STEVE!!!"

"event","So here i am, sitting in my bed or my 'safe zone' and having more anxiety. i'm getting those dumb waves again- i'm starting to think i'm coaxing myself into feeling them, rather then actually having them. i can never tell because i am so physcologically fucked up. -sigh- I took Xanxax tho, only a fourth, so i should be ok in a bit. This dumb laptop located in my room doesnt have aim so i cant chat, and i have to stick with using this journal to pre-occupy my thoughts. i just hope i'm not disturbing my mom too much with my typing... the space bar is really the only thing thats noisy, figures. i'm gonna go play cards now."

"event","Didnt go to school again today, my stomach was bothering me again. I hate worrying about everything, it's so bothersome, but i suppose its part of my anxiety. always thinking somethings worse then it is. I had a panic attack yesterday, it was so horrible. What happened was James and i went to Arbys and i ate, and then we went to borders to create my christmas list that everybody's been pestering me about. When we were going there, i was just panicking. I'm not sure if James knew about it then or not, he doesnt act any different when he knows i'm having anxiety, either that or he chooses to ignore it or at least not treat it any different. I took a half a xanxax, and i was actually HYPER rather then tired after it. James thought it was because i was slap happy. But, i fortunatly, finally got over the attack, but it was true hell. 
Tonite i get to go to the Christmas concert at my church with my family and James. I'm really excited about it, especially the part where i get my coffee. its the best. It's a french vanilla shake. Mmmmhmmmm. I'm almost positive James will get some form of it as well. lol. Then i'm also looking forward to the store they have in there, i wanna buy another ring, i gotta thumb ring a while ago that says fear not, and i found another one i liked and imma own it. yay. 
So i found out one of my really good internet friends, Robert, claims to be 'madly in love with me'. of course, i cannot claim that he isnt because i'm not him, but he says it just sorta hit him. he lives in texas, and i'm over hurr in michigan... so it would make things even more difficult to cope with. I wonder if he really IS in love with me. I felt that way for him before... but i have james now, and i really do love james. Anybody who is close to me knows that. More drama for my life, although i cant say its the negative kind, when someone likes you it's not exactly horrible... most of the time its a compliment. 

Buy me a christmas present."

"event","It bothers me when it seems like people cant talk about anything but their significant other. I hope i dont do that with James, i try not too. Not that i DONT want to talk about him... its just, hes always on my mind and i'd rather people not know what is in my mind. More later."

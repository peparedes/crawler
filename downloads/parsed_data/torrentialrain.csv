"event","&nbsp;Dear Mr. Computer,<br />Now I have returned at 5:00 am. Oh goodness, I'm turning into a major party animal.&nbsp;<br />Tonight I&nbsp;went Korean clubbing for the first time at Le Cercle. (sp?) The vibe is very different than gay or normal straight clubbing; I'd almost go as far as to call it a bit sleezy. Most of the floor is covered with tables for one and the dance floor is tiny! I saw some &quot;booking&quot;&nbsp;occur - that's when the waiters grab girls walking by and &quot;force&quot;&nbsp;them to sit at tables of guys. Don't get me wrong, the club is very clean and the decor beautiful and modern... just the feeling one gets is less than savory. Our guys are awesome and payed for everything so we luckily had a place to sit and rest. ^^y&nbsp;<br />Then we went to karaoke for a couple hours. It's quite fun and exciting!&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like I'm recapturing my youth-if-I-was-wild (I wasn't) ... so perhaps more of a reinvented youth. I am the youngest one out there in our group (I think). Totally gotta lose &lt;strike&gt;some&lt;/strike&gt; lots of weight though to fit in a little better. Oy vey. &gt;&lt;<br />I had bought many bottles of soju for our excursion of which we imbibed none of. Now I&nbsp;am further along my transformation into Korean party girl with my pantry fully stocked with 8 or 9 bottles of soju as I didn't count as I bought them.&nbsp;Wooooweee!&nbsp;<br /><br />And has anyone else out there heard of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies?! It's apparently a rehash of the<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pride-Prejudice-Zombies-Classic-Ultraviolent/dp/1594743347"">&nbsp;</a>classic as a zombie novel. I've uh... never actually ready Pride and Prejudice ^^; but it's remake sounds mighty interesting!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pride-Prejudice-Zombies-Classic-Ultraviolent/dp/1594743347"">www.amazon.com/Pride-Prejudice-Zombies-Classic-Ultraviolent/dp/1594743347</a><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","Dear Mr. Computer,
Oh look at me coming home at 4:30 am. 
Why so late? Well... couldn't drive home drunk now, could I?
Where to begin...
well I went out to Aya's little single's gathering and wow, these guys were all so Korean! Like REAL Koreans! All these boys are like Tae Kwon Do Champions of some sort and totally fit all the Korean sterotypes. I met Megumi who is this really cute and high strung half Korean half Japanese girl aged 23. I spent half the evening protecting her from the boys who were picking/flirting with her. It was hard to tell since they were poking and prodding her all night (one with a fork). 
The boys came an hour late to the restaurant and started out with shots of soju which I managed to fight off for about half an hour before just giving in and got a little bit tipsy. But two guys were just drink, smoke, drink. All in a very very very korean male way with polite offers to pour. I tried hard to fight it off. I did. [not really] I think we went through around 6 or 7 bottles of soju and they weren't even phased. One white boy came towards the end of the meal. Which we didn't even eat all of.... &gt;&lt;&nbsp;The frugal part of me cried. 
Then it was off to karaoke! The first place was booked so no good and then we went to place number two which was again, SO&nbsp;VERY&nbsp;KOREAN! There were colored lights and lasers and everything! Then about 10 minutes into it, the waiter comes with like 10 bottles of Hite for the... 8 of us. Um... this was the first time I got drunk off beer and boy was I drunk. Singing on the tables drunk! Oh my... ^^;; My dress was cute? And I lost my brooch. Sad days. Aya drove us back and even though I was sitting bitch in the back seat, Megumi was whining that white boy was hitting her (not hitting on) so ended up with his arm around me and i grabbed onto his wrist. The end of the trip was the very uncomfortable molestation of me. Ew - drunken white man. Gross. Luckily we got out of the car and went up to the apartment to sober up a little bit and then went about our separate ways. 
I'm Still a little bit tipsy I think? Safe enough to drive though so I'm ok!
And now I have a sort of lunch date with Jin Young tomorrow? I was... kinda really drunk... so a little blurry. I have his number - supposed to call after church. He's this tall, lanky, chain smoker of a fob TOTALLY&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;MY&nbsp;TYPE who is a bodyguard to the prince of Ghana and doesn't speak English... at all... Oh so random.&nbsp; Yeah, I was pretty damn drunk. lol."

"event","Dear Mr. Computer,
I have sooooo much to catch up on so I'll start with all my Thanksgivings:
Dinner with friends went beautifully and the turkey was juicy and wonderful and quite possibly the best I've tasted to date!
We all ate until we were more or less incapacitated by food coma, no?

Family dinner was foodful! My aunt went kitchen crazy and pumped out a turkey with tons of sides and homemade pies. =9
And it was definitely exciting. On our way to my aunt/uncle's place we stopped to pick up my grandma, who lives on an apple orchard. My dad wanted to ride his dirt bike so we took an old '94 LandCruiser which is a big old car with lots of power and a ""check engine"" light that never turns off. My mom and I had doubts about the car's long distance capabilities but my dad insisted it was fine. So we went and made apple juice as my dad ripped around the place on his bike for a while all was well... then he turned on the engine to the car and we smelled poo. All of us checked our shoes and found nothing and then my dad peeked outside, turned off the engine, and jumped out and opened the hood. We thought that maybe, somehow, an animal had crawled into the engine somewhere and got shredded up because there was this reddish brown viscous stuff just pouring out from under the engine. Much craziness ensued. Luckily my uncle knew a mechanic who lives in the area and makes house calls who fixed it. It turned out that the hose connecting the transmission to the radiator popped or popped out so it was a relatively easy fix. Whew! ^^;

Actual Thanksgiving day was spent in Vegas with the parents. It was quite possibly the most fun we had in Vegas to date. It might be because my dad and I won a tidy sum of money... or the fact my mom and I went on a shopping spree... or even possibly because I was constantly the LOUDEST person on the pit floor at any given time. ^^;; The luck I had those few days were SO AWESOME! And not only did it follow me around but it rubbed off other players when I watched. It was great. At one point I was at the Venetian cheering on my dad and 2 old Chinese men at the table and all the pit-bosses were laughing at me while they raked in the dough. The only time things were bad when on of the dealers at TI made a mistake that cost me almost $200 and the pit boss refused to rectify it. =P Anyways, I made that up and moved on. We just decided never to go back to TI again. Haha."

I sleep around 10 hours a day now and I'm still sleepy during the day. I'm totally having trouble shaking this funk - perhaps I need to get out more. 

A big thank you for everyone who celebrated with me earlier this month! 
I have yet to send out the thank you email. ^^; 
Korean BBQ was super fun and we should all go again just for the heck of it!

Thanksgiving is peeking just around the corner and I'm gearing up for it... through master cleanse!
I kinda cheated though because I stopped a day and half early because I want to be able to go out for the no against prop 8 rally. So I'm probably not fully cleansed but I achieved what I wanted which was to reset my eating habits. 

My family's Thanksgiving gathering is going to be on the Sunday before Thanksgiving leaving actual Thanksgiving to be spent at Vegas. Now... as much as I love sin-city, I'm seriously thinking of passing for BLACK FRIDAY instead!! =0 !! Why?! Because Supernatural is ON SALE FOR $15!!! AAAUUUUGH! 
I'm so torn. SO TORN!"

The firefighters put out the fire in the canyon and had a fire engine posted at the canyon's end with no houses lost in my immediate neighborhood. On my way home, I drove up to Sesnon road to take a look but I didn't really see much. So I guess the fire ate up all the brush and vegitation and moved west to Simi Valley. 
I thank the fire department for their excellence. And thanks to everyone who expressed concern. I think I can stop stressing for now. ^^;"

Last night was pretty awful. It was reeeeally windy so the window in my room started howling and kept waking me up. When I finally got fed up with it, I moved out to sleep on the couch but sadly my dad switched around the furniture and the comfy plush couch got moved downstairs and the italian half wooden one got moved up. Why didn't I just walk down? Since the motion sensors were on and I would have triggered the alarm. *sigh*
I wish I could have at least slept in. T_T But since I was unprotected by a locked door, I got everyone's morning ritual and the dog. 
The food that I bought to sustain myself for the next few days is now down to less than half - thanks dad and William. -_-
Oh, and after knocking on my door for the past 2 days, I got my monthly visitor. Greeeeat. Now I will be spewing blood from both ends. Joy joy joy. 
At least the pain is bearable. *knock on wood*"

"event","Dear Mr. Computer,
My extraction went a lot better than I thought it would! My dentist is super good. ^^y
He gave me the anesthetic a good 20 minutes to set in which got me all good and slurry and made me feel little pain. Then I made him explain each of his evil looking tools before he got started. Teehee. 
<i>Dr. Lee: Seriously? You don't want to know.
Me: No wreely, I wan do know. 
Dr. Lee: Well ok....</i>
Then as he was working on the first tooth I started to reach for my camera...
<i>Dr. Lee: NO!
Me: Awww...
Dr. Lee: Well... I guess it's ok. Oh you kids these days! My daughter would do the same thing. You're going to take video to aren't you?
[switches tools]
Me: I ras'n goin do bud thas a grea idea!
Dr. Lee: Are you going to put it up on youtube? If you make a profit, I get a cut!</i>
The rest of the procedure went similarly. Where I'd talk in slurry little bursts between teeth.
I'll add the pics later. 
So the first two came out easily, and I've named them ""Easy"" and ""Painless"".
The third hurt even with an additional injection of anesthetic so its name is ""Pain"".
The last one is about a quarter of the size of the others and his name is ""Fucking Pain In The Ass Enamel Coated Whore"". Looks cute but it broke on its way out and Dr. Lee had to do a little mining. I think it took as much time to get out the last one as it did to do the other three. So now I have them all in a little toothfairy box as a souvenir! 
I took a couple Advil when I got home and it's working pretty well and I managed to get though Survivor and most of Supernatural ok. The second part of Supernatural was a little painful and I'm more pained now. I'm going to try and get through recovery without the vicoden but we'll see where tomorrow leaves me. I have a very low pain tolerance and I have a bottle of the stuff so maybe my curiosity to try prescription level pain killers might get the best of me!"

7:30 - Flush kicks in. At least it made it through in a ""decent"" amount of time. I don't think I'll ever do the flush again. It never got easier, only harder, throughout this ordeal.
I had a dream... it was one of my epic an movie type dreams but I don't remember it all anymore.
There was a war and I was supposed to blow up a ship but in the process I killed my lover and was transported to an alternate universe. I don't remember much in between but there was lots of action, fighting, and explosions. I ended up letting my lover in the au die before returning to my own. Very tragic.  

9:30 - Flush still going. I think it's almost done. .. .. I think. SOmetimes it's hard to say. 

11:45 - I'm ravenously hungry. It's probably because I'm so close to the end but this juice just aint cutting it. I even anticipated this and added more maple syrup to it to make it sweeter. I've also felt a little iron deficient the past couple days with my vision blacking out when I stand and walk in succession.  

11:00 pm - My stuff from Victoria's Secret came today. Yay! I had to fill the void that not eating had created so I filled it with shopping! Lisa sat and played FFCC-MLAAK while I stripped in the corner. Then Joanne came and we both stripped in the corner. Heh heh. She also brought her swimsuit collections from the sample sale. Lots of fun! 

I managed to get my hands on a wii fit! XD I went to two best buys that were sold out before snapping up the last one at Game Stop. Had I have been 20 seconds late, the guy behind me would have gotten it. There's nothing quite as satisfying as getting the last one. Bwahahahaha!
We made miis for Lisa, Han-yee, Ann, and Nicole and went wild. 


More importantly, I'M DONE!!!
Well... with the cleanse part anyways. Tomorrow is orange juice all day. Though I plan to make soup for dinner. Accelerated acclimation! 

Final thoughts: The master cleanse is quite doable. Days 1 and 2 were a little hard but once day 3 hit, it was pretty easy until day 8. I don't think I experienced all the negative side effects I've heard about but the cleanse, not so bad. Now, the FLUSH in the morning was SO GROSS. It didn't even get easier as time went on, only harder. So gross. So gross. Ew. So gross. The lax tea woke me up early in the morning with stomach cramps, the 4 cups of salt water was hard to get down, and it took up to 4 hours to pass all the way through. Truely unpleasant. 
All in all, it was ok. I'd do it again if I ever really felt the need."

My second one was about going to prom? Random. 

9:12 - stomach cramping.... ugh..... 

11:59 - Finally made it to work. For some reason, the flush took over 4 hours today! Geeeez. I wonder what I did wrong or differently. It tasted like the normal salt flush. O.o
My tongue has cleared up considerably though; more or less back to normal, even. 

8:52 - I had a couple of cravings today, nothing like day 1 though. I wanted tacos and cheese on broccoli. Once I'm off the cleanse, I'm not going to pig out on food. I will just transition right into a healthy, balanced diet geared to loose weight."

I woke up at 7:30 and started my flush and promptly resumed my play of FFCC - My Life as a King. That's more or less all I did today except a quick trip to the mall. I clocked in nearly 12 hours of play time. O.o; 
Today reminded me of my old summer vacations where I'd play final fantasies ALL DAY. But I'd have to stop to eat (not so on the master cleanse!) and then my mom would get on my case. On a good day I could get in 10 hours, 7-8 on average. 
It now feels <i>normal</i> on the cleanse. So normal, in fact, I'm a little worried that I'll forget I'm on the cleanse and eat a morsel of food or take a sip of something without even thinking about it. 
Tomorrow I'll try to play a little less and do a little more other stuff."

8:06 - Whoo hoo! Got my stimulus package! XD
Lemons were kind of dry today so I had to use 4 and all the pulp. 

2:27 - So for those of you who don't know or have forgotten, I work in a digestive disease lab. That means I work with lots of MDs and PhDs who know a lot about the digestive system. So I was sitting in the lunch room just sort of sipping on my lemplenne and my fellow lab techs are like ""do you know what <i>she's</i> doing?! Tell them! TELL THEM!!"" So I sit there and give a brief outline and then they go, ""Tell them what you do every morning!"". -_- 
My boss gave this face and said, ""If you want a cleanse I can write you a prescription for one that'll take two hours."" Har har. 
In short everyone now thinks I'm crazy and/or stupid for doing the master cleanse. 

3:35 - I like the lemon pulp because it gives me something to chew on.

I have so much crap to get done. I'm totally going to do it tonight. I'm so screwed. 

9:29 - I fell asleep. . . lying down. Damn

11:33 - I think I've stopped losing weight. Or I've been at the same place for the past 3 days. I wasn't really expecting to lose a lot of weight with the cleanse but more than 3lbs at least... sad days.

7:00 - Finally managed to finish all 4 cups of the salt water flush. I hate this flush with a passion.

9:42 - Will go to work today but the flush is still making its way through. Made my mix with agave nectar. My initial opinion is that i like the maple syrup version better but it took a while to get used to that one so I'll hold out on an official opinion until midday. 

11:30 - I can totally do this as long as I don't think about it too much. When I think about it, I get hungry. 

12:39 - I think agave is more taste neutral than maple syrup but I still think I like the flavor of the maple. The agave would go really well with some cooking recipes though so I'll save it. 

1:15 - My lab is right across from the break room so whenever someone microwaves something, I SMELL IT. It doesn't give me cravings but it does make me a bit hungry. 

1:38 - I smell pizza. .. . ... ... with pepperoni. (My bad, it was bbq chicken.)

2:55 - I could totally go for some chocolate.

9:12 - day is nearly over. 7 more to go. 

10:46 - I feel like I need to poo... but there is no poo to poo. How frustrating. Hopefully tomorrow's flush will take care of that. My tongue is becoming quite fuzzy; a sign that the detox is progressing?"

Did my salt water flush. . . took longer and wasn't very pleasant. I'm a little afraid to go to work just in case I need the bathroom in a hurry so I'll wait a little longer. 
Lemon + maple syrup + cayenne pepper = lemplenne? 
Living off of lemplenne for 10 days seems daunting. If I had pressed on with my original cleanse, today would be day 8. 

11:00 - Called in sick to work because I can. Poopile sneezes a lot. I wonder if he is sick. I hope not! I've grown quite attached to him. Today will be spent catching up on work and possibly getting him a cuttle bone and/or a companion!

5:54 - Came back from dropping HY at the mall and slept. I was really sleepy and now I have a headache. So much for getting things done. ><
I'm getting weird food cravings probably cuz I know I can't eat. Luckily a swig of lemplenne seems to temporarily quell cravings. Weird. 
Foods craved so far: cheeseburger, curry, chicken salad, pizza

8:18 - I miss eating even more. 

10:00 - My tongue has started coating already. One of the ""symptoms of detox"". Still don't think there's a lot of science backing this diet but there's enough personal testimonial that I'll continue. 

11:18 - Last thought before going to bed is, ""I could really go for a large bowl of sweet yellow corn with a generous helping of Irish butter"". I am feeling mildy hungry"

It's still processing through my system. So. Gross. I really hope that it will go faster as the days go by. I don't want to be stuck around a toilet for hours at a time each morning. ><
Made the lemonade mix for the first time and I'll say it's not that bad though not really gourmet either. 
It's moderately passable and will probably grow on me. The fresh lemon is quite refreshing though.

9:36 - I smell toast... someone made toast... I want toast...

The Zung bbq was a impressive as ever with food materializing everytime we thought we were safe. There was tri-tip, bratwurst, sausage, pork rib, bacon-wrapped shrimp, and rib-eye just to name the meats! I think I might have eaten a pound of caprese salad. God I love mozzarella. 
Then on Sunday we went out for dimsum and shaved ice. Yum...
Now. . . I start the master cleanse!
I figure I'll keep a little diary of it. See how my condition improves or degenerates.

I'm feeling... the cosplay itch! ><
It's this feeling I get once a year that I gotta make a costume. 
But not just any costume - it must be better and more impressive than the year before...
Why I get this urge I will NEVER know. I suppose it's akin to the migration instincts of migratory animals. 
I suppose it's ok since I do keep it to one a year and this year I'm not at home. 
There are still a lot of more important things I need to take care of before I can even think of starting it, like MCAT repeat, school applications, etc, but if all goes as planned I think I will cosplay Yoshi (of the green dinosaur variety and not the Watanabe breed). 
There - I said it. 
We'll see how things go though... and if I can find green fur in the right shade or if I even <i>want</i> to work with fur again this year."

I have no experiments to finish, continue, or start. I'm sitting here surfing the web trying not to look completely lazy and failing utterly at it. 
Life at the new apartment is hot and mostly uneventful, which is lovely, though I greatly miss the luxuries of hot water and a full sized fridge. A great big shoutout to Nicole who has been letting us use her shower as well as feeding us massive amounts of okonomiyaki. Yay!
Two days of gorging combined with a few weeks of eating out has my waistline slightly bulging and my wallet slightly slimmer. I wish it would be the other way around.

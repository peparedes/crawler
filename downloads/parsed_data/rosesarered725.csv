"event","<DIV>Today was the last full day of school.&nbsp; From now on, we get out at 11:00 instead of 2:05.&nbsp; That also means that Ian and Mike will not be driving us because they are seniors and pretty much finished.&nbsp; I think I'm gonna sk Danny for a ride one day, but seeing how every other time I have asked, he has ahd others in the car and said I couldn't, I;m beginning to think he's avoiding me...boo Danny.&nbsp; I am happy that its almost summer though...except that tow of my best friends are leaving me. And speaking of that, I found out last night that Katie leaves next Tuesday, not the 5th.&nbsp; That bites the big one.&nbsp; I wanted to scream when she told me that.&nbsp; We're trying to get a sleepover in on saturday....hopefully her parents will say yes, circumstances considered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I actually had fun today...mostly:</DIV>
<DIV>English/ History:&nbsp; We did presentations.&nbsp; My group was supposed to present on Thursday last week, but the retards couldn't figure out how to make the computer work so we got bumped back to Friday...then the smae thing happened and when they finally did get it working, the groups before us took for-fucking-ever....so we got movd to today.&nbsp; I told&nbsp;Mrs. Sutton&nbsp;we had to go today because we had already moved twice and we had costumes this time, and she said ok, i'll put you at the top of the list...but did she? NO! she didn't because she is retarded.&nbsp; AHHHHH!!!&nbsp;I hate that class.&nbsp; The fucking John Walley was being his annoying self.&nbsp; he went to get the book and came back with another group's to look at so I asked why he didn't get our and he sarcasticaly told me he couldn't find it.&nbsp; I really had to hold myself back from slapping him.&nbsp; Then he looked at me and said ""Ya know, you could go get it too....you can.""&nbsp; Like am some lazy ass who had done nothing on the project and forgot to bring my notes on what to say on the presentation...that little bitch must have been looking in a mirror because that pretty much discribes him.&nbsp; Grrrrrr...I want to punch somebody sooo badly!!!!!&nbsp; Ok, calming down.&nbsp; Well, we finally got to present and it pretty much sucked.&nbsp; Oh well, I did good so those fuckers can get a bad grade for themselves...I'm getting a damn A if i have to kill for it. Whew....on to the next class.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Algebra:&nbsp; This class was basically a waste.&nbsp; All Mr. J did was collect our grade sheets and talk to students who needed help.&nbsp; We just sat there and talked the whole time.&nbsp; I'm gonna miss that class next year because I liked sitting with Shannen and Danny and Kathy...and Mr. Johnson was cool.&nbsp; I showed Danny my portfolio and he said he might take photgraphy next year.&nbsp; Too bad he's gonna be at the new school and I'm not.&nbsp; Then Shanned told us some of her bad girl stories which made me looking like a damn angel.&nbsp; She says I have a halo.&nbsp; Lol...oh well, if I feel like changing, i guess I will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Lunch:&nbsp; Oh yeah, somebody found Erin's history book this morning and gave it to her, right after she went to the finance office and paid for it.&nbsp; Lol, so I went with her before lunch to get her money back and told her she should just keep the 60 dollars for herself bc her parents think she still paid for it.&nbsp; I doubt she will though.&nbsp; Lunch was just Lunch...nough said.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>French:&nbsp; Oh my...that was an interesting class.&nbsp; Me and Becca had some deep conversations.&nbsp; That thing as 10 fricken pages long.&nbsp; Tamar saw us writing and was like ""Geez, you're writing an essay.""&nbsp; Two guesses what we talked about....lol.&nbsp; I love her.&nbsp; She's my sexy bitch.&nbsp; Take me to the beach with you, sexy bitch. I promise I'll be cool with the boys,...minimal staring.&nbsp; You, don't even know if they're hot, so whats there to worry about?&nbsp; Teehee.&nbsp; Alright, I guess I'll just leave you alone about it and see what happens.&nbsp; Madame Remaili did nothing that class.&nbsp; Final is next class.&nbsp; Fuck.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>~~Becca: What are you and Tamar doing?&nbsp; You look like those asian nail polish ladies.~~</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Photography: Always a pleasure.&nbsp; Again, nothing to do because it was almost the last class and we just handed in our portfolios.&nbsp; McKinzie, Amanda, Megan, Rikki, and I all&nbsp;discussed our boy issues.&nbsp; I have no boys, therefore was mostly just listening and givng input.&nbsp; Oh yeah, Phillip knows that I'm Stacy now...so we'll see what happens with that.&nbsp; I will laugh if he calls....because it will be funny.&nbsp; Mr. Price says we're just gonna watch a movie next class.&nbsp; I could just not go but I probably will to hang out with Megan for the last time in Photo class...this year at least.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There was my day...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ok, now, about boys....my favorite topic.&nbsp; I feel bad about something.&nbsp; there is this guy that liked me a while ago and I don't like him in that way at all...he's kinda wierd.&nbsp; Buuuuuut, I like to be liked and kinda want to be nice so that he'll still like me?&nbsp; Is that bad?&nbsp; Haha...yes.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; Well, at least I admit it.&nbsp; Other than that little epiphony I had of liking the fact that he liked me, nothing with boys has really changed....blah!!!!!&nbsp; We also debated whether or not we like the idea of a boyfriend better than the boyfriends himself when we get one.&nbsp; I found that to be true in some circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>I could flirt with all the guys</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Smile at the them and bat my eyes</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Press against them when we dance</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Make then think they stand a chance</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Then refuse to see it through</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>That's a thing I'd never do</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>I could stay home every night</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Wait around for mister right</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Take cold showers every day</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>And just throw my life away</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>On a dream that won't come true</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Thats a thing I'd never do</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><EM>I could hurt some one like me</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Out of spite or jelousy</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>I don't steal and I don't lie</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>But I can feel and I can cry</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>A fact I bet you never knew</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM>Cuz to cry in front of you....</EM></DIV>

"event","Ok, so I think I should update because I haven't in really long time.  So, what has been going on with me? 

Well, first off we have this decades project in English and Erin is not in my group with sucks.  Also, I have kept putting off all ogf my work, partially because I don't understand how we're suposed to, like, phrase the summary and partially because I am just lazy.  Lol...probably more the second one.  Ooo, which reminds me..I never got that picture off of Erin's camera so I hope she still has it or else I will have to make something up.

Nothing more school related is happening that is making me stressed really.  Except that there are only 10 days left! Which is great in a way and bad in a way.  Not gonne get into that right now tho.

So it has been really really effing hot for a week or two and yesterday Thomas invited me to his pool for a little party that his neighborhood was having.  So Erin couldn't go but I still went because I didn't think it was wierd.  Is that wierd that I go over to his house when Erin isn't there?  Hmmm....I think my parents think it is a little.  Oh well.  It was fun.  The food was really good and then I got to go swimming for the first time in forever.  Now here's the funny part.  I didn't bring underwear with me to change into and I just wore my bathing suit under my skirt because I didn't actually think we would swim.  So, then we went back to his house for a couple hours till my mom picked me up and I had to borrow a pair of his sister's boxers.  But, then I couldn't wear my skirt over them, so I wore a pair of Thomas's shorts....ok, now, Thomas is really tall and I'm not, so his shorts were like 2 inches below my knees.  It was hilarious man, hilarious.  Then my mom came to pick me up and i was wearing them and she didn't even notice.  That was wierd.  We watched Grease and talked to erin a lot.  Her parents had said that if my mom would bring me over after I was done at his house, i could have spent the night there....but my mommy said no :(  Next week.

Hmmm...what else? Oh yeah, we got our yearbooks on friday and mine is missing like 10 pages out of the seniors but its after my brother's picture so its all good.  As somebody (i think it was Megan) said...more signing space!

Well, I really should shower...then do that damn project so I think I will."

"event","Its getting a little annoying writing in this because I want to, but I dont want to at the same time.  Some random movie is on the TV right now and there is this quite hott guy without a shirt on. mmmmmmm....That made me happy...because like, 90% of my brain is focused on boys 24/7.  I really need to try and give a little more of that to school work. Whatevs.  

So last night I went to Mandy's party and I thoguth Megan was going but then I called her, like 15 minutes before it started and she didn't know about it so....that sucked.  I only knew Laura and Mandy there and they all knew eachother and I just feel awkward in those situations so for the first couple hours, I felt wierd about it.  But then I settled ina nd Thomas showed up, having seen that I was there on my away message, and that as fun. 

I am pretty damn tired right now.  Erin kept me up till 1 last night.  Its aight though...I'm a teenager, its what I do.  I am also home alone because my entire family (including Ian) is working.  It's actually kinda nice to be home alone.  I would rather be out with a friend, but its aight.  Oh, yeah, Happy birthday Mrs. McKenna.  

So...I'm gonna go do something productive.

Oh, and, Erin, watch out if we're still in sync bc I found out why I have been hating the world for the past few days....lol."

"event","Have you ever had that feeling when you were hanging around your friends and they're talking, not even to you, just, like, talking and it pisses you off to the point where you think ""Wow, just shut up!""?  Well, I have felt that way all fricken day.  Today sucked.  I don't know why.  Maybe I'm sleep deprived from staying up an extra hour last night. Ok, here goes....

This morning, we got in the car and of course Ian cannot stand driving when other cars are present and bitched at me for being a minute late to the car because in those 60 seconds, all of the cars around him that were forcing him to only go 5 mph over the speed limit magically appeared.  ugh....jerk.

So then I got to school and we went to the Media Center for English/ History class and had to do fucking research on Decades.  I had to spend money to copy, like, 50 pages out of some book for information because we must have photocopies of all our sources go into ""the book"".  I hate Mrs. Sutton.  Mmmk, moving on.  I felt like passing out the whole time during that class and one of the guys in my group is really really annoying so that just made it worse.

Ok, then came Math...that was ok.  I got candy because my column was making the best progress on that stupid final review packet.  I had to ask Danny for help so many times though.  And then everybody in the class had to also.  Somebody was like ""I don't get it."" and he said sarcastically ""Of course you don't....."". I thought that was really funny because they never ever ssem to understand the easiest stuff in that class.  But i guess I shouldn't talk because I have asked for help many a time as well.

Ok, so Health was next and the klids in that class never shut their mouths either.  They just talk and atalk and talk until the teacher gets pissed...then they wait five seconds and start talking again.  Today, being in my PMS-y mood (even though its not time for that yet), it was really bugging me so by the end of that class, I was ready to kill somebody...ahhhhh.

Lunch- Fine.  Megan's boyfriend,  Bryan came over and talked to me.  He's nice.  He went to tap my shoulder when he was leaving and I flinched....like really flinched and he looked all surprised and was like ""did you think I was gonna hit you?""  Sitting at that table has made me paranoid. lol. 

Chemistry sucked.  I hate it.  I never want to go to it again.  AHHHHH....
OK, we had to do this stupid titration lab and at frist I was the only fucking person actually trying to do the work in my group (at least it seemed that way....thomas was helping though) then I was doing it and I messed up the first one and made it really pink which is bad so i felt alright because that was what was suposed to happen.  Then, for the second trial, i forgot to put the indicator in it so it didnt work at all and we wasted the chemicals and had to start over so i felt like and idiot.  So then, when we were doing it over, i was putting the base in and it got incredibly pink again!  So they were, like, bitching at me.  I just put down the stuff, walked to the other side of the lab bench and said ""somebody else fucking do it them"" (thats exaggerated actually).  So Chris decided to do it.  He is so wierd.  I was on his list and now he, like, calls me hot and pretty and makes kissy faces at me whenever he sees me.  And OH YEAH! He told a fucking nazi and rascist joke.  I wanted to punch him in the face!  So then we did the last two trials and added MORE base than I had put in, so I was doing it alright, we just hadn't let it sit long enough.  Then wehn I said something like that, Thomas said ""We know, nobody said you did anything wrong..."" then got quieter and said ""...just stop whining about it.""  So I shut up and let them do it, cleaned up, and sat down.  Then, Mrs. Engles passed back our unit tests and I had gotten an 87.5 out of 11 which i knew wasn't good so I was upset (later she told us that the ones who finished EK early got 10 points added to that so I really had a B+) and when Thomas asked me what I got, I said i didn't want to tell.  Then, when we passed them forward, he went through them and saw what I got and, like, bitched at me for being upset about it, which made me more irritated than what had been building up all day....but I understand that he wasn't in a good mood either, so whatever.

Wow, this is getting long and I'm not done yet.  

After school, I went straight to my locker because I was pissed and then met Erin @thomas's locker and we came here, to her house on the bus.  That was actually fun and now I am in a much better mood, but I am still really fricken tired.

Ok, so now I guess I can be finished.  Maybe I'll write again later...."

"event","<DIV>It is almost 8:00 and I don't know why I am not still asleep.&nbsp; I want to be, but its just not working so I got out of bed.&nbsp; Lastnight, at like, 10:00 I passed out.&nbsp; I wasn't even tired.&nbsp; I was just lying in my bedd awaiting a return message from Thomas or Erin (which never came, by the way....bitches) and then it was, like 7:00 in the morning and I woke up.&nbsp; It must have been those cleaning chemicals.&nbsp; That was....whew...it smelled soooo bad&nbsp;and was still there like an hour&nbsp;after I had cleaned the shower.&nbsp; I probably should have done the shower last so I wouldn't be smelling it while I cleaned the rest of the bathroom.&nbsp; Oh well, now my bathroom is fairly spotless as is my&nbsp;bedroom.&nbsp; There is no junk on the floor! Nothing that I don't plan to be there!.&nbsp; However, my desk is cluttered still.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Me and my mom are goin to pick&nbsp;ERIN up at 9:00 to bring her here where she&nbsp;will be kept until......forever!&nbsp; No, just till Thursday.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>There was a place by Thomas's house for sale and my mom wanted to look at because she wants to move closer to school.&nbsp; That would be awsome beyond belief to live there because Thomas is like, two houses down and Becca is down teh street.&nbsp; Buuuuuuut....I have become accustomed to my rather large bedroom and where I live.&nbsp; It would be wierd.&nbsp; I <STRONG>love</STRONG> my room and my house and my neighborhood....well, the neighborhood is good, but it would be a lot better to be right next to one of my best friends.&nbsp; I doubt that we are gonna move though.&nbsp; My parents have been saying that since I was at Browne.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ok, I'm gonna go find something productive to do...like make my bed...or wash my face because i feel gross. </DIV>"

"event","<DIV>Mmmm...I smell like i just came from the beach.&nbsp; I didn't though.&nbsp; Today, Thomas had to go to his pool all day to pass out pool passes to the neighborhood people.&nbsp; So, he invited me and Erin to come over and hang out with him but she couldn't come so it was just us two.&nbsp; We stayed at the pool for a good three hours and I got a nice tan.&nbsp; We sat on the lounge chairs and he had to tell two people that were ""delinquent"" hat they couldn't have passes.&nbsp; I like sitting by the pool.&nbsp; Its realaxing.&nbsp; And i got some color.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Then it started to rain and thunder so we went back to his house to watch TV but his parents weren't there so instead we had some crazy sex.....wow, just kidding.&nbsp; We did watch TV...some sport relay race where football players competed on ESPN.&nbsp; Then we got pizza from Stone Hot and I ate tooo much.&nbsp; I had, like, four slices. Lol, I felt like a pig.&nbsp; I really like his dog, Cookie.&nbsp; She's a dalmation and i remmeber that wehn I was little, I always wanted a dalmation puppy but my mom would say we couldn't get one and explain to me that they grow out of being puppies. Oooook, so after watching TV, we went back to the pool because his mom called and told him too.&nbsp; It was ok though because it was starting to get sunny again, even though I had to wear my sweater and he used my towel as a blanket (got a funny picture of that, but you probably had to be there to appreciate the humor....lol).&nbsp; Nobody else came to the pool for passes.&nbsp; It was just us, the lifeguard and the supervisor who's skirt was toooooo short.&nbsp; Then his mom got there and my dad came to pick me up.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That was my day.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun.&nbsp; Thomas is funny...lol.&nbsp; It would have been cooler if Erin could have come...butthead.&nbsp; Lol, just kidding,....I love you!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So now I have been trying soooo hard to get my room clean for tomorrow morning when my little birdie comes to stay with me, but somehow it never quite gets clean.&nbsp; I dusted yesterday, but that just seemed to make it look dirtier.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Ughhh....I guess I'll try again later.&nbsp; I still have to do the bathroom too. Ahhhh!!!&nbsp; Erin, I am really glad that you are coming tomorrow, but do I really need to cleean for you?&nbsp; yes, yes I do.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hmm....what else is there to talk about?&nbsp; Took the Chemistry final yesterday.&nbsp; That was a bitch.&nbsp; Kathy and I were, like sharing answers but didn't know the same ones so that probably didn't help much.&nbsp; At least I get ten extra points added for finishing my EK early.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yesterday after school...What did I do?&nbsp; Did I do anything?&nbsp; I can't fucking remember....somebody tell me if you know.&nbsp; Oh wait!&nbsp; I know.&nbsp;Mike came over and we watched Aviator and ate chinese food.&nbsp; ""Way of the future, way of the future, way of the future...."".&nbsp; That guy was caaaarazy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So tomorrow....ERIN FREAKING DURIAN IS COMING OVER!!!!!!&nbsp; Then, Thomas said he wanted to come over, but thats lookin pretty iffy.&nbsp; My dad wants to go to the Memorial Day Parade so maybe Erin will come over and we'll hang out here alone.&nbsp; Then Monday, we will be at Springfield Mall.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I wa sooo wired last night.&nbsp; I have no idea why.&nbsp; But i was dusting at, like, 11:00 and talking on teh phone with Megan and she was like ""Wow, I have never heard you talk this fast.""&nbsp; I am a true night person.&nbsp; In the morning....no....but at night...lets party!&nbsp; By the way, Megan is quite the lucky little bitch this week.&nbsp; Love you dearest!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Megan has a boyfriend now and I am soo excited for her.&nbsp; He's nice too.&nbsp; He even came to my lunch table today and talked to me for a while..and it wasn't awkward.&nbsp; Thomas doesn't even do that. May be he should be my new best guy friend....lol, j/k.&nbsp; I love you Thomas and until he writes my name on dessert for me, you will still be my favorite boyfriend in ""the group"".&nbsp; Anyways, I approve Megan (like you care..lol.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also, they were selling those matchmaker thingys at lunch today that they were supposed to sell before valentine's day.&nbsp; A little late, but I still wanted it.&nbsp; Apparently, there is an 87.5% chance that PT would like me.&nbsp; Oy vey.&nbsp; There is also an 83.2% percent chance that I would like naked man in the garage (aka Erin's brother).&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Nothing else is really new.&nbsp; I am finally done with SOLS as of today.&nbsp; Last one was this morning.&nbsp; Now I just have to make it through finals in the coming month and I will be free!&nbsp; Summer, here I come!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Next week is gonna be so fucking good.&nbsp; I just want this one to end so I can get right into the three day week.&nbsp; Monday then Friday then Monday off again!&nbsp; Also, Erin will be sleeping at my house Sunday through Thursay...thats right....5 days!&nbsp; So here is how my weekend is looking.... Saturday: Thomas's pool for something....Sunday: Erin!....Monday: Mall, or maybe not seeing how my friends are psycho....shhhh! We'll talk about it later...lol...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What else?&nbsp; Oh yeah...no, he has not called me.&nbsp; I'm not counting on it, but just wanted to let whoever reads this know.&nbsp; Now Thomas is targetting somebody else to hook my up with. Gotta love my friends.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm gonna end this now....I'll add more if I think of something.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ok, so on Friday, Tamar had her after IGSCE thingy and only me and Laura went, but it was still fun.&nbsp; We watched Mean Girsl (I found quite a few ways that i am like Regina...lol), ate Pizza, and taught eachother different dances.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Then yesterday, Megan, Erin, Jamie and I went to the baseball game at school so megan and I could take some photography pictures and even though we are supposed to mess them up on purpose, I still think that I didn't do it right. Oh well.&nbsp; That was fun.&nbsp; the guy the Megan likes was working there and I kept going to the conscessions stand because I actually wanted food (hadn't eaten all day) and they all thought that I was just trying to get Megan over there.&nbsp; I hope they work out because they were cute sitting there talking.&nbsp; Then we went to Ruby Tuesdays and sat for a couple hours.&nbsp; We eat too much fatty stuff.&nbsp; We got cheese fries, and some sampler thing with more fried food...mmmm.&nbsp; My mom got, like pissed at me because she thought that I wouldn't be able to wake up early enough to go to handbells.&nbsp; Oy&nbsp;vey.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Ok, now to this morning.&nbsp; I woke up at 7:05 and was like ""No, i cannot get out of bed yet"" so I stayed in bed for 5 more minutes until my mom came in and told me to get ready.&nbsp; I was soooo tired but I couldn't complain bc my mom had told me I was gonna be last night.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; Then we went to handbells and I was thinking about how boring it was gonna be because Kerri wasn't there to talk to and I would be sitting by myself.&nbsp; But Greyton sat with me and we talked for a while....so it wasn't bad.&nbsp; Then, when i left, I gave him my phone number.&nbsp; But I feel really dumb about it because I must have looked like an idiot.&nbsp; I am such a spaz....I just sort of gave it to him on a piece of paper....I really should have said more.&nbsp; Oh well, the time has passed and I can't change it now and if he calls, he calls.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Now I am sitting here bored listening to random music because nopbody is online to talk to.&nbsp; La dee dah. I'm gonna go find something productive to do, like clean my room.</DIV>

"event","Today was fun.
I had lunch with Thomas and it was funny to watch his interaction (or lack ther of) with Shannon.  Lol.  

Earlier I had two hours of health which was fun too because my Alex and I pretty much just talked about random shit and listened to each other's iPods.

I think somethiing just bit my foot...

We watched a psycho Italian movie in English class about the holocaust and it made me sad but it was funny at the same time.  My loverlie wasn't ther today :(  Never ever leave me alone in there again...I had to walk alone into the building...but I did see mr hottie on the way in so that cheered me up like whoa.  

Ok, what class am I forgetting?  Oh yeah, Math...only had it for 25 minutes so nothing beg happened.   Talked to Danny and Shannen...thats about it.

This week has been pretty good for various reasons.  I can't really name them but I have just been happy about this week....then again, I'm never really that upset.  I did almost cry when Erin McKenna said that there are only 23 days left in school.  That means I only have like a month left with Birdie.  I am going to lock myself in my room.  Its been a while since I have been really depressed, but it is gonna be sooo different without her here... a lot is gonna change.  *sigh* stopping now.....

So...what else to talk about?  Dunno so I am gonna end this..."

Then the rest of the day was alright.  Alex found his iPod and the girl he thought had it before did have it.  Becca says she doesn't think the girl would do something like that but the evidence strongly points to her doing it bc she had it and it has Alex's name and sn on it....so...whatever.  That was funny.  Megan heard us saying something about it and was like ""Yeah because when I got an iPod, I put some random name on it too...""  Yeah, she ate with us today because her SOL schedule put her in B lunch.  Yay. That was cool..she saw my violent side though as I beat up my friends.  What?  They started it...

Chemistry was boring at first but then we had some free time.  Thats about all to say about that class.

Drove home with Mike again and almost had a heart attack...oy vey.  He slowed down a bit though because the po-pos were out today and he cannot get caught again for speeding.

Now I have just downloaded lots of new music...yay.  I haven't gotten new music in a while and I was geting bored with the stuff I have.

I'm off to talk to my loverlies....yes I mean Erin and Thomas."

<DIV>Then we played one song, ate cookies, and left early.&nbsp; Kerri had to tell Mr. G that she isn't gonna do it next year and he made her sit there for like ten minutes guilt tripping her, trying to make her say she would.&nbsp; Then when she finally made it out, he trapped her mom on her way out the door.&nbsp; Oy vey, if she doesn't do it next year, i might not.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>So today was good...I got to rest all day then go see my boo...lol...I can pretend, can't I?</DIV>

<DIV>So on Friday, I went home with Beccers and spent the night there.&nbsp; We went to the mall and ran into Charisse and her mom...that was cool, hadn't seen her in quite a while.&nbsp; I bought the Something Corporate CD and Becky got Bright Eyes.&nbsp; Thn I went a little crazy with smackers lipgloss..lol.</DIV>
<DIV>When we got home, we got pizza and watched part of Euro Trip, fully intending to stay up late, but only making it to 10:30.&nbsp; On Saturday, we called Thomas and walked over there.&nbsp; Ity took us an hour because we went the really long way around.&nbsp; Hung out at his house, then walked&nbsp;back to Becky's with him (which only took 10 minutes) and watched Harry Potter.&nbsp; He had to leave at 3:30 tho and Becky and I put on From Hell instead.&nbsp; Johnny Depp is quite the hotty.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Then it was play time.&nbsp; I wore Becky's really hot halter top...i stole a shirt from her Friday and earlier too...lol.&nbsp; We met Thomas, Erin, Megan, Margaret, and Eric there.&nbsp; I got really confused though bc Erin didn't seem very excited to see Thomas, but now I know what happened so whatever.&nbsp; The play was good.</DIV>
<DIV>Spent the night at Becky's again last night...but her friend didn't call....i was dissapointed. lol. </DIV>

Hieroglyphics? Let me be specific I wanna be down in your South Seas 
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means small craft advisory 
So if I capsize on your thighs high tide B-5 you sunk my battleship

"event","Today was Sonny's funeral.  She was like a second mother to me pretty much my whole life.  As far back as I can even remember, since I was sixth months old, we have known the Golans.  I cried a lot.  Karen gave a beautiful speech.  I feel bad about all the missed opportunities we had to go to see them.  Days when we would be coming home from Beth's house and my mom would ask if we wanted to go but we would say no because we were too tired.  If I could now, I would go.  I should have pushed to go over and see them because it is a rare thing and now I won't get a chance to see Sonny anymore.  I wish I could tell her that she meant something to me and I will miss her and that even though we aren't blood related, she was like family to me.  I prayed each night after hearing about what happened.

I can't even imagine what it would be like to lose my mom.  I don't want to imagine it.

I have to stop now before I cry really hard and my family notice.

Rest in Peace Sonny Golan (5/6/05)
and Happy Mother's day"

"event","Today was really good...until a few key people had to go fuck it up....

I had a great time @the lacrosse game with Erin, Thomas, Megan, Margaret and Eric...haha...funny kid.  

Eric: Your butt is like a fireplace...
Me: Why?
Eric: It's HOTT!

He makes me laugh....

Ok but now I am home and I feel like just crawling into a fucking ball and dying.  My mom gets mad at me for every damn thing I do even when I haven't really done anything wrong.  I told her 8:00 then she yelled at me bc it was two late....FOUR GODDAMN HOURS AFTER WE AGREED TO IT!!!  AHHHH!

Ok, well, I'm gonna go cry now and maybe sleep...and no that is not all that is pissing me off...im not that emotional.

I'm depressed right now because, as I may have told some of you, a really really good friend of mine's mother is in the hospital.  Sonny who I have known since I was 6 months old, has been like family to us.  She had a heart attack and I am really upset.  My mom went to see them yesterday but I didn't really hear about it.

I'm glad to be home though.  I missed my friends...and I really missed the internet. lol...i have a problem, ok?  get over it.

Not much to say right now. I'm just bored.  I'll probably add another entry later."

"event","Here are ten lines from ten different songs.  Post a comment telling your guesses of what song it is and who sings it....

1. ""She looks up and the building, says shes thinkin of jumpin.  She says she's tired of life. She must be tired of somthing""

2. ""Started talking shit, wouldn't ya know.  I reached back like a pimp and I slapped the ho.  Then her father stood up and he started to shout so I threw a right across and knocked his old ass out.""

3. ""You only see what your eyes want to see.  How can life be what you want it to be?  You're frozen when your hearts not open.""

4. ""Let me be your wings, let me be your only love, let me take you high above the stars.  Anything that you desire, anything at all.  Every day I'll take you higher and I'll never let you fall""

5. ""He is the lamb. She is the slaughter.  She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her.  Nothing that he tells her is really having a effect.  He wispers that he loves her but she's probably only looking for so much more than he could ever give.""

6. ""My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent.  Bring you back to the bar, get you out of the cold.  A sober straight faces gets you out of your clothes.""

7. ""She hangs around the boulevard.  She's a local girl with local scars.  She got home late, she got home late.  She drank so hard the bottle ached.""

8. ""She said 'Don't...don't let it go to your head.  Boys like you are a dime a dozen.""  Boys like you are a dime a dozen she said.""

9. ""If I get drunk, well I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you.  And If I hither, well I know I'm gonna be, i'm gonna be the man who's hitherin to you.""

10. ""Look around the world pretty baby is it everything you hoped it would be.  The wrong guy, the wrong situation.  Right then, the wrong me.  Look into your heart pretty baby is it aching with some dream.  Is there somethin wrong and you can't put your finger on it?""

Ok, there they are.  Good luck everybody.  Who ever gets them all right first will get a hug!  Lol...whatever."

"event","Body: This was written by a guy who has years of experience. Believe you me, most of them are true about girls....

1. Whatever you do, don't just show up at herr house...she runs around in their underwear just like we do.

2. DON'T CHEAT ON HER. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, she WILL find out and you will be mud.

3. Beware of every single male relative and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your ass at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the damn hat.

4. Never miss an opportunity to tell her she's beautiful.

5. Don't refuse to kiss her in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's just because they're jealous.

6. If she slaps you hard, you deserved it.

7. Don't be afraid to touch her if you want to. If she's going out with you in the first place, it's because she likes being in your arms.

8. If you don't sleep with her, DON'T tell your friends that you did.

8.5 If you DO sleep with her, DON'T tell your friends that you did.

9. You can be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it...

10. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales.

11. Most of them don't mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a pussy..

11.5 Do you honestly need all your money that much? Be a man, pay all the time!

12. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring. Even if it's not a serious relationship.

13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely.

14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to beat the shit out of him.

15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer.

16. Never, EVER slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, ""Oh, you're so dumb"" or something, never make any gestures back.

17. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went.

18. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents, and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals.

19. Don't flirt with their moms...that's just freaky.

20. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like shit, so be understanding.

21. If you don't like the way they drive, you do it.

22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend.

23. Don't stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you.

24. If they complain that something hurts, rub it for them without being asked.

25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle.

26. Memorize their god damn birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life.

27. Don't marinade the cologne, but smell good.

28. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice.

29. If you think the relationship isn't going to last, don't wait to find out. It will only hurt you more if you draw it out.

30. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, privilege and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nanosecond.

(If you have read this and you are a girl, then some of these things are actually really true...am I right?! And if you read this and you are a guy, then these are like the mother fuckin best tips you could ever get!)"

Ok, well pretty much the worste trip ever. I don't know why I can't seem to just hang out with those cousins.  Oh well.  I wasn't suposed to come back till tomorrow, like, late.  But Zeev called this morning to tell us that Sonny is in the hospital in critical condition so we drove to Denver with my uncle and aunt and got on an earlier flight.  Damn it is good to be home.  Just got in the dizzoor about 20 minutes ago and I should probably go to sleep bc I will be attending the Hayfield Secondary school tomorrow.

Love you all!
Good night...

"event","I am so sore.  LOL. Its a good thing though, bc that means I did good in my workout.  My butt is sore though, and I didn't even work my buns...mist be from jump roping.

Today in school, I tried to make a mental list of everything I'm gonna be missing over the next three school days that I'm not gonna be here...its a lot of stuff. These have to be the worst three days ever to miss. Lol.  Tomorrow, I have my photo project due but I won't be able to work on it till tuesday when I get back.  I also have a French quiz, ana an Algebra quiz.  Then Friday we're putting our review packets on scantron in chemistry and taking the EK test and having another Algebra quiz.  Monday I have an Algebra test and probably a French test.  Damn, thats a lot to make up and I still have to make up the last two EKs.  Oy Vey.  At least Mrs. Sutton moved the english quizes.

I'm not really looking forward to goin to Colorado.  I'm not a fan of flying because airports annoy me, don't know why.  Also, I won't get to see my precious friends for four whole days!  I'm also missing a party. Bah humbug. Then there will also be no internet for me which means no AIM.  AHH, just shoot me now.  LOL. My cousins don't really hang out with me.  Sloane is younger than me, Bryce and I have never been that close that we actually just chill, and Chelsea always has friends over or is going out.  Oh well, thats why some guy invented the cell phone. hehe.

So i have been having a good couple of weeks.  School hasn't been as horrible..we haven't really been doin anything.  Last night I talked to chris...that was fun.  Then today I didn't have the english quiz I would have failed for not reading the damn story.  Becca dyed her hair and it looks good.

Well I should pack :(

History- did some dumb busy work assignment. Erin took my phone and was in the middle of reading all of my text messages when I remembere there was something she wasn't suposed to see so I took the phone which made her flip out about why she couldn't see it.  LOL.  She was like ""you can't have secrets with him (thomas).  You're suposed to tell me.  You were mine first!"" LOL...that was funny. And actually, it's a secret with Megan...technically she had me first. Haha...love you erin.
Algebra- Just OK....
French- LOL!! I'm gonna kill you Becca....just give me his fricken screen name. What's the worst that could happen? AH! J/K, if you don't want me to have it, thats fine.  Got off on an hour long tangent about the difference between French people and Americans.
Photography- Developed...thats about it.

I have decided I want to better my drawing skills so I tried to practice and sketch some people.  First, i tried myself, but it came out..badly.  Then I tried to draw this picture on my wall that has a guy and a girl kissing.  That one's alright I guess.  There's something wierd about the guys though, and I can't figure out how to fix it.  Maybe I'll go work on it. 

I think Ian is planning on making me work out today. *sigh* I really don't want to....."

Thomas is a crazy SOB.
First, during EK he fricken lifted up his shirt and I was trying so hard not to laugh.  If he had gotten me in trouble, I would have kicked his ass...yeah, thats right, I could sooo take you.  LOL.
Then, while we were working, he was playing with his gum (like he always does) so i tried to shelter my binder in stuff because he spits it on them, but now, I didn't make it.  He launched the gum across the table and hit my calculator.  AHHH.  Then I opened my binder to actually do work and he fricken spit it on my worksheet.  That ho. LOL..i'm kidding. 

Ok, the rest of the day was pretty boring...as usual.

I got home and had to shoot my entire water as a subject project for photography because I was dumb and didn't do any of it when it was really warm outside <strong>or</strong> when it was raining.  That would have been the smart thing that people who don't procrastinate like me would do. oh well.  I think it got some good pictures.

Then i had the overwhelming urge to try and draw a picture of myself.  It actually looks like a human though, so I guess it wasn't a failure altogether.  I just need some practice.  Becca told me to practice, so I will.  I'm bad at lips...and hair...

Two days till colorado.  I don't know if I'm looking forward to it or not.  I'm gonna miss my dear dear friends, Erin, Thomas, Megan, Becca, and all you other people I usually hang out with at school...Alex, Tamar, you know who you are (that kinda rhymed if you say it right). And my cousin never hangs out with me when we're there.  She's always out with her friends. LOL...if I tried to have friends over/go out with friends when family was here. my mom would say ""hell no!"".  Well, i'm gonna go converse with Thomas and Erin, if she comes back. Love ya.

"event","Last night was not very good.  Thomas and Erin got into a fight and I was stupid again and got in the middle.  I need to mind my own business.  Then I was stupid yet again and commented on something Thomas did so then he got upset at me.  Last night I text messaged him and we talked for a little while.  Then I was trying to go to sleep and he messaged me like four times until I called him.  I haven't talked to either of them since then so I don't know how things are as of now.

I had handbells in church this morning and we <strong>sucked</strong>!!  I messed up like four times.  He was crazy for having us play that song though because we obviously aren't good at it.  Keegan just cannot stay on time.  he was playing every fricken note two beats before he was suposed to.  Idiot.  Then it threw me off becuase theat song is hard to keep track of when the people around you are on time. Bah! Lol...it was funny though because Kerri and I were talking about people's butts because everybody else was standing up and we were sitting.  The greyton had to carry the little tray thing that you put the offering in and when he was standing in the aisle, Kerri was like ""oo Liz, look at his butt *wink* *wink*"". LOL! So this morning wasn't as bad as usual.

Then we went to Starbucks and I couldn't get anything because its not kosher. Boo!

Now Ian and I are watching Lemony Snickets.  Jim Carrey is psycho!"

"event","<DIV>Today was good for the most part...</DIV>
<DIV>I woke up around, oh, say, 9 and nobody was online to talk to so I went down to the basemtn because I can do stuff online on that computer faster.&nbsp; Then Katie called me and we talked a bit and turns out that she was allowed of groundation today so she rode her mbike over.&nbsp; Then we hung out here for a while but decided to go for a walk.&nbsp; It was ""spitting"" a bit when we left, but it was fun.&nbsp; Then we went to get Danny but they weren't home.&nbsp; Haha, that was fun.&nbsp; First we rung the doorbell then nobody answer so we knocked a bit.&nbsp;But as we were walking away we saw that both cars were there so we decided to go around back and surprise him by putting our faces by the little window looking in his basemnt/room.&nbsp; Then, as we were creeping around back, we heard noises and burst out laughing and ran back around front.&nbsp; We stood there for a while, then decided to try going round back again, but just ended up doing the same thing...lol.&nbsp; Then the neighbor was like ""I don't think they're home.""&nbsp; Haha, they had been watching us.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After Danny's we went to Alex's house and made him come out with use.&nbsp; Then it started raining harder, which was fun.&nbsp; Alex took us to some dam that is right by our houses and we walked across, then around the lake, then back.&nbsp; I was in flip-flops, so that was a n experience.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; When we finally got home, i was exhausted and crashed for about an hour and a half.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Dinner was the first night of Passover, so we read the haguddah and everything.&nbsp; There was one part that says ""The mountian skipped like rams and the hills like lambs...what ailest thee? Oh sea! That thou didst flee."" and when my mom read that part, i just found it funny and said ""Dr. Suess, is that you?""&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; Nobody else enjoyed it as much as i did tho....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Now I am sitting hear with the worste headache ever listening to my iPod with he window open because it is like an inferno in here.&nbsp; Wow, my mom is crazy because she was the only one that didn't think it was hot.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After I got home from the walk thouhg, my day went to hell.&nbsp; Now I'm kinda in a bad mood about a few different things...but I don't feel like saying them on here...so if you ask me I might tell you.&nbsp; Well, i guess Im gonna lie down and die because i feel like my head is gonna explode. Lol...good bye.</DIV>"

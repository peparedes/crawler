"event","Last night Evana Sylva called me.  She lived here for a few months four years ago.  When she moved back to Texas I only heard from her once.  But now she's moved back to Dillon, permenantly from what I've heard.  She was 11 when she moved away, and now she's 16.  Unfortunetly she hasn't really changed all that much.  Our conversation lasted for about 10 minutes, and most of it was her making plans with me to do this, do that, can I come to your house, can we hang, out, and on and on and on.  Now, I'm not being mean or anything, but I really don't like to hang out with people.  Call me strange, but I only like to go places with someone every once and awhile.  And dad doesn't like for me to have anyone over to the house all that often.  So now I have to deal with this until I move away from here.  Why do all the clingy people choose me?  Why can't they latch onto someone else?  I'm so tired of being the BFF to every person who comes along.  Mom says everyone wants to impress me because I don't act like I want to impress anyone, and she said besides that everyone likes me and that makes some people feel uncomfortable.  Which I really didn't understand, but oh well.  

Anyway, last night I discovered that if I press the vain in the bottom of my palm under the thumb, I can make the blood stop flowing and watch it start flowing again.  COOL!!!  It's blue too, which is wierd.  Ok, now after this and the vampire thing last night everyone thinks I'm strange."

"event","Playboy gave the talk today.  Staring at him for 45 minutes is too much for me to bear with.  

JT wasn't at the meeting, but Ariel was.  She wanted me to go to Florence with her, and I said yes, (due to boredom) and she later informed me that she couldn't go because she ""forgot"" her and her mom and JT and her mom were going to NC to shop for dresses for the wedding.  It's SO nice how they invite me to go places with them.  

Anyway, I showed Playboy my camera and he oohed and awed over it and said he's going to get one.  Maybe I shouldn't have taken it to the meeting.  I don't know, I have this feeling that no one likes me because I have alot of stuff.  We are one of two white families in our congregation, and everyone thinks our two families are rolling in dough and can buy anything we want and go on as many vacations as we want.  We do buy alot of stuff, and go on alot of vacations, but we aren't rich.  We just have the means to buy stuff because my dad is really tight with his money so he has alot of it.  Also, the Granthams are rich because brother Grantham owns his own construction company.  I'm just sick of no one inviting me anywhere, and I think this is the reason why.

I still can't find a free GIF maker, and evertime I ask in an icon community everyone ignores me.  I refuse to pay $100 for adobe, if that's how much it costs.  Even if it's less, that's asking a bit too much.

We are having pizza for dinner, yay!  

Oh yeah, JT gave me a shirt last night at the meeting.  They bought it for me but it's WAY too big, (I hope they meant it as a joke, I sure as heck don't wear a 23/24).  I doubt it if they would care if I took it back and exchanged it for something else.  I can get my messanger bag if I do that.  Or maybe it will pay some towards my charger.  Whatever it really helps me out.  They were kind to think of me, and I wish I could wear it because it's cute, but it falls off me.  Literally.  I told mom I was going to wear it anyway to be nice but she said there was no way I was walking out of this house in a shirt that would fit two of me in it and that falls off my shoulders.

In other news...Elizabeth will be here a week from tomorrow!  I can't wait!  I wonder what mom is having for our early lunch?  I don't think dad is going to be here, though.  He might, but he said he has some ""judicial matters"" to take care of that day.

Then after lunch we went to the flea market and I got a 136-compacity CD case for the trip.  Very nice.  I had to start using a second CD case this summer because my old one only held 64.

I know I'm not supposed to go anywhere with her, but still.  They could at least invite me.  I'm just plain sick of it.  She knows how it feels to be left out, and yet she does it to me.

Then after service we went to Mcdonalds for lunch and I got one of thier Philly Cheese steak subs.  It was ok, but it was nothing like Brother Lances' sandwiches.  I really miss those.  I haven't had one of those in a long time.  

Sorry Ozzy, we can't go with you to Hilton Head.  My dad said we can't go because it's too far away and we are leaving to go on the cruise a few days after that.  Speaking of the cruise, new clothes, a new bag, some new shoes, and other crap is needed for the trip.  I must go shopping."

For those who knew my foster kitty who i got 3 weeks ago and was pregnant had her babies midnightish (11:45) and finally finished and got to sleep about 2:30-3ish.&nbsp; 

The boys decided that they didn't want to be born on the same day as the girls so were born last night and the girls were born today.&nbsp; There are two of each. I will post pictures when I can get some cute ones of them.

Shadow&nbsp;hasn't been&nbsp;happy with me since I&nbsp;brought&nbsp;the&nbsp;kitty&nbsp;home&nbsp;though&nbsp;has&nbsp;warmed&nbsp;up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;since&nbsp;hearing&nbsp;the&nbsp;kittens. The dogs have been loving having the kitty around though Willow&nbsp;hasn't figured out what to think about the babies.&nbsp;


Okay I have come up with some names for the kittens and so has Phil who likes which ones?

&nbsp;Mine

Gallifrey
Pigglet
Torc or Torque
Gizmo


Phil's

disposable # 1
disposable # 2
disposable # 3
disposable # 4


Hope everyone had a great holiday.

Hugs"

Now that I&nbsp;have slept to get back all the sleep I didn't get from Thursday through Sunday night so I feel half way human again.&nbsp; I had a blast this year in part majorly to having a kick ass volunteer who worked hard and I trusted and anyone who works a con knows getting both of those in one person not so easy.

I am looking forward to working on next year (after the party and wrap up meeting). To everyone who helped to make this a great year thanks."

"event","Hey everyone,&nbsp; 

For those that don't know because I have just been so busy.... There are now 2 hunters in my family my cat Shadow and our newest dog Allie that we got in April...

Friday she found a nest of baby thumpers ( you know rabbits) well out of the 4 that were born sometime that day only one is alive so I am now a foster mom for the next
6 to 8 weeks. So if you want to see me you know where I live... 

Well my roomie Chris said I couldn't name him Thumber so Worf it is for the next few weeks... He is doing well and eating well so I am hopeful that he will live and I can
Then release him to either be happy and mulitiply or become Hawk food which ever the Gods decide.

This whole thing has made me realize that I am the happiest in my life when I am taking care of animals domesticated or wildlife... Yeppie only took almost 30 yrs to figure it
out... 

I am very happy because Phil is being VERY supportive and understands that this means a lot to me and I am greatful for that... Because I know it is getting hard to not have a solid 
8 hours of sleep a night... The baby has to be feed every 3 to 4 hours... Which is the reason I am up now I had to get up at 4:30 to feed him and now my brain is wide awake so I knew 
that I wasn't going to get any sleep...

Saturday was fun Phil took me to the Music City Brewers Festival it was my first time I am so glad that my neighbor was able to watch Worf because it was sooo much fun. 

Well I guess I should go for now....

Love everyone&nbsp; and remember if you need to talk to someone or just want to say hi just call odds are I'll be up.

"event","Hey Eveyone,

I know it has been a while since I posted on here.&nbsp; I can't believe how busy I have been and not having a job I think is where I have worked in some sleep.
For those that I have been talking to off and on this new year know that I have been getting a LOT of Migraines. Guess what I have found out where they are coming from besides stress. My Glasses broke on Thursday morning and I have had to get new ones so I decided if I am going to have to pay $250 for glasses I might as well get my eyes checked well my left I is better but my right eye with the stigmatism has gotten a lot worse as far as the RX goes.&nbsp; So hopefully after my eyes adjust to the new RX I get in two weeks i will not have so many migraines to interfer with life.

I am sorry that I missed everyone at Ostara this year. The left hip (one that is real) popped when I got out of bed that Friday morning and periodically is still giving me problems so is life.

On one of two good&nbsp; Animal notes on Monday it will be 3 weeks since I got my new baby. (DOGGIES ROCK!!)&nbsp;&nbsp; She is 2.5 yrs old and is a Husky, Golden Retriever &amp; Chow mix for those that have met here can atest she is a good dog. And for being Phil's dog she sure listens to me well ;)
The other good news is that my cat Shadow is now 6yrs old and those that know me and animals will know why that is so special.&nbsp; Shadow still isn't sure about the new doggie because Allie who is ~40 pounds wants to play with her like Willow does and She just see's this 40 pounder running towards her. The next few weeks or months should be fun.


On Human Good News.&nbsp; My sister had her baby found out that she was a few weeks late (me and my mom had been telling her she was farther along that the dr said but won't listen to us we don't know what we are talking about).&nbsp; Elizabeth Nichole Hetchler born March 28 at 11:08pm weighing 7# 12oz and 21 inches long.everyone came through well after two days of labor. My sis didn't want drugs for pain or to make it go faster.&nbsp; 

FYI this is April and MTAC is about so my free time until May is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love everyone and hope to talk to you all soon."

(Me, Phil, Chris &amp; Brian) Well for the most part it was okay the lan thing went until 9 or 10 but a friend that&nbsp; I don't know if he is on the lan list or not came&nbsp; because he comes every year. This year he came with his wife and two daughters which wouldn't be such a bad thing but the eldest daughter doesn't know how to behave and the parents don't correct or keep an eye out on them.&nbsp; (Curzon you know who I am talking about). <br><br><lj-cut text=""RANT"">
The Rant is when they got here the first things out of his mouth was NOT Hi or Happy New Year is was is the guest room bed free (youngest daughter is about 15 or so months old)&nbsp; I had a friend staying in there and their stuff was in there as well. Instead of asking is there anywhere else he could put her he took her up there and messed up the futon. I told the mom that there were some toys in two drawers and that the kids could play with them if they wanted just put them up when they were done.&nbsp; The kids got some toys out of there and also; anyone who has been at my home know we have ""toys"" that aren't ""toys"" on shelves for display, the kids and parents have been told these are not for them (for many years). Multiple times Phil and myself had to take these from them and the parents either didn't watch what the kids were doing or saw and let them continue dispite our objections to this.The girls were also told at every visit NOT to terriorize my animals, seriously Willow gets freaked out enough, Willow got so freaked out from being terriorized that she ran to the bedroom to hide. The eldest daughter kept trying to come into the bedroom even though this has been you can't go since she was a baby. 
</lj-cut>
<br><br>Okay here is the questions for you and what do you think.<br><br>1. If you brought your baby to a party and asked the host if you could put them in the guest room and they said that it was being used by a guest. Would you ask if there was somewhere else to put your child or go ahead and put them in the guest room anyways?<br><br>2.&nbsp; Do you think that it is the parent's responisbility or the host's to watch your children and pick up after them?<br><br>TL<br><br>"

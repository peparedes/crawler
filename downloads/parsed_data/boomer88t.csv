"event","Wow. So its been forever since I have updated. Sorry about that. Now where should I begin. 

So my job has been going really great. The people there are amazing. They make me laugh all the time. At first I felt like they didn't like me, but then after getting to know them a little more and them being comfortable around me things got better. I crack jokes all the time at work. I always play off what others are saying. But yeah it going good. For a while I felt like the boss hated me, but then I overheard her saying how i was a good worker and good at my job. Since then I have gotten more hours then anybody else. The lord has blessed me with a great gift. So lately none of us have been getting hours. I needed at least 40 hours and I was only getting about 20. So I decided to get another job. The job i found, or should I say stumbled into was CHEF, at the hotel I work at already. How awesome is that. I'm gonna learn how to cook. But don't tell Annie, I love when she cooks for me, and how I pretend not to know how. 

Lets talk about LT. Its seems like It been forever since I've been here. 5 weeks I believe. CRAZY.  I'm so busy all the time. After I work like 4o+ hours I do LT for another 23 probably. It seems like Im always on the go. But Im learning alot so its worth it. 

NOW ON TO THE MAIN EVENT

ANNIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I love this girl so much. She makes me so happy. Every time I talk to her no matter how I'm feeling, she always seems to lift my spirits. The other day Steve told me that he can really see how much were in love. Not me and Steve but me and Annie. He also said that like the mournings I do talk to her are the days I'm most happiest. He says I have a better outlook on life. I AGREE. I wanna grow old with this girl. I want her to be apart of the rest of my life, and for me to be a part of the rest of her life. She doesn't know it but I'm saving up for something really special for her. SHHHH don't tell. Gosh I cant wait till she comes and visits. I want to hold her so bad. and kiss her and squeeze her cheeks... ok not that last one, even though I would if she would let me. I love her.


I think I'll end with that. 

I LOVE ANN ETHEL NELSON SO MUCH."

"event","People say that when I write poems, I sound crazy, or that they normally dont understand what I am saying. Thats probly true, because to understand me, you would have to know my past. You would have to know why I do the things I do. You would have see the internal me. You wouldnt understand unless you knew me. You wana know me, ask. Ask why I stay up at night, ask what I think about, ask me if I'm ok inside. Ask me? I so badly want tell people, I wana tell people about the secrets that  hold me, but I'm so afriad, that even if I get the chance, I couldnt do it. But if you were to ask me. If were to ask me, Whats your life been like, Or whats happended in your life thus far. I could tell you. Then I would ask you. 

I have no clue on what is ahead. if to fall or fly or if I'll be dead, I do know I love her, and whats more than that, a soulmate forever not just a draw from a hat. a chance of a life time, a moment to sweet, is a moment with you, the day that we meet, at a chaple in june, under the stars, the quiet steps of your feet, the world soon to be ours, as your eyes meet mine, and we say our I do's, that is the day, I will finall have you, have you forever and a day, but only if you want to, What do you say?"

"event","Everyday trials

I was once lost in darkness,
A wandering nomadic fool,
Teetering on the edge of reason,
About to plunge into the abyss,
Then a light shone down,
Lifted me out of darkness,
Touched my soul with grace,
And beat love into my heart,
That was when I met you,
My loving girlfriend,
For so long now you
Have continued to save me,
Day after day,
You gave me the reason to be,
To live and to feel love,
To go on and find my dreams,
As long as you were there,
I just wanted to let you know,
That I could never fully express
How much I feel for you,
When I love you 
Seems so simple,
How can you put into words
The power of desire I have for you,
Pray to God,
Channel the muse,
And let my fingers type the words,
My heart beats because of you,
My soul is bright and alive,
Because of you,
And even when the trails of today, or yesterday
Seem to distract me,
My love is always devoted to you,
It is eternal within my heart,
Like a constant thunder in my soul.

I can not let a wedge come between us, I feel heart broken. I have wanted to just curl up into a ball and cry since yesterday. I feel all alone in making the right decion. there is only one thing I can do now, and that is to pray. I haved stayed up all night praying and have been praying since then none stop. I dont like to feel alone. I love you, Forever no matter what."

Anyways, today was so fun, stayed the night at my aunts house, and hung out with all my coool cousins, my cousins boyfriend came over and played me in a game of basketball, it was fun. Then we watched Dodgeball because my cousin alicia hadnt seen it yet, then I went to bed
The next day I got up went to the golf couse and played 18 holes for free, because my cousin works there, I golfed with my cousins boss's grandson, he is 14 so it was fun, at one of the holes I went to drive and the club sliped right out of my hands and the club flew 30 yards so that was funny
after that I went back to there house ate, then went home, where I started moving my room. 
Then we all went out to dinner at applebees, where I saw Shaun Spevak I know I spelled the name wrong so sorry Shaun. 
Then my family went to Meijer to pick out bed sheets and stuff for my new bed they bought me today, so that was fun, we went back put them on then left. 
I am so excited for moving, cant wait till I am in and I can have friends over, we can have party and things its going to rock

But now I am just watching tv and letting the night slip away. Hopfully I get to eat soon I am hungry. anyways that was my day, here is a quick poem I wrote in like 10th grade:
 Apoclaypse
Red
Death
Like
Quiet smoke
Betrays the
Night
And in
Return
In gulps
The day
Atrocious
Beast 
Come out
And take
The world
At large
All good
Is strung
Up
And Comsumed
Waist pours
Throughout
And the world
Runs"

Your at the top of it all and all others stars have stoped just to see you go by, then your already gone and there back to doing what they've always done. Everyday there is that moment where your the shooting star, atleast one moment everyday, your the center of it all. It might be amoung twenty or just one, but theres allways that moment.

"event","When you love someone so much that you would die for them, and so much that if you made them upset you would just wana tear your heart out cause you know that making them upset makes you even more upset, and when you get to the point where you said something stupid and you cant take it back, it hurts so much that you cry your self to sleep that night. When you love someone to the point where if you had to get beaten up over and over or jump off a cliff or lift the heaviest thing on earth, you would always find a way to do it and a reason to do it, and of course the reason would be them. You love someone to the point where if they left, you would die inside, everything around you would seem to fade away. All that you loved doing, you would realize that you only loved doing that because that certain someone was with you. you realize that without them life would be unbearable. You realize that you would fight anyone and anything just to get them back. Even yourself, which is the hardest battle to win, the battle agianst yourself. When you find the person you know you wana spend the rest of your life with, everything feels right, and when you are away from them, you want them near, you want them to be there with you, to love you, to hold you. I belive the only real way to know you truely love someone is when there gone and you want them more than anything. They say that it is better to love and lose them then to never have loved at all, but the reason you know you loved them is because there gone and you want them back. When there gone, your so confused but at the same time deep in your heart everything is all clear, and you realize you love them and it hurts even more cause there gone. She was gone, now she's back. I won the battle within myself. I lost her, and it hurt and I ran from the hurt, and hide from it, and found other thing to hide my hurt, so that it seemed all ok,but inside I was a mess but now thats she back it realy sucks cause by hiding from my hurt, to her it looked like I never loved her at all. I hurt her by running from my hurt, and if I loved her enough I would endure any hurt no matter the size, now I will always screw up and probly allways make her mad, but I still love her. and always will. There isnt a girl in the whole world like Megan Lee Van Every"

which I gaze upon
and slowly, slowly melt away"

I must use words I have never used
they will hurt
and they will make them cry
I hate the pain 
I am about to do
Why do I put myself in these situtations
I must move my mouth 
in a way that
will sound 
right
but at the same time
it will hurt
deep inside
If this be a mistake
cut my tounge out now
so that I may not speak these words
Send a lighting storm to take me away
Hit me with a earthquake that will swallow up the noise
I am about to make
Help me in what I am about to do
Let your will be done
Dont let me faulter
I know not what the word to use is
Please speak for me
unless this isnt your will
living is taking risks
but death is making mistakes
You live and die
is the life worth it
cause when you take that risk
your die soon after
I guess its worth the life
I must jump into the water
but then I will get wet
then I will get board
then I will get out
then I will dry off
and be in the exact 
position I was in
before I jumped in
so what is the point
of jumping in
is it the fun, while swimming
while getting wet
you may not know the outcome
but why worrie
its only your whole life
Hold on to  things you keep coming back too
it probly the right thing
please give me
The word to use"

I hate to feel this way
my life just seems so frayed
Why when I need you most
you stay silent and let my humanness roast
I cant belive this
my insides are ripping apart
my stomach aches from my heart
my body wont let me rest
all I see is my unhappiness
save me from this wound
that will not heal by itself
it just ozzes out
but stays inside
I'm all filled up, but I feel so empty
Just let this pop
let me feel no pain
cause no matter where I am
I hurt all over
there is one place, where I feel secure
but everyone is telling its a mistake
can this be a temorary feeling
I pray for my heart to be unbroken
take me up
let me leave
there a point in man life
where he feels 
incomplete
like he lost
he gives up
he loses
I wont do that
cause I am no

I dont lose
I dont give up
I am a man of god
No one can defeat me

I will go on
I will surive
I will listen to my heart
I dont care what everyone else says
I might me forced till my 18th

I will do what make me free
I will live
I will go on
I am stronger than I look

at times but friendly, and you are never weak
and always independent. You are incredibly
intelligent (wise beyond your years) and have a
talent for many things (sports, music, art).
You have a kind and warm personality and enjoy
the simple things. Like hanging out with
friends and watching movies at home. But you're
sometimes quiet nature makes you a bit of an
outcast and a mystery to people. No matter how
pretty you are or smart or athletic, you just
can't seem to break into the crowd and be
noticed. Don't worry, try to be more outgoing
and speak out when you have more to say. Don't
hide behind your books and sports and computer,
get out there and get noticed. You also have
deep desires in life and feel vunerable and
alone at times. Don't feel sad either, What
helps me to express feelings and dreams that I
can't say to people, is through my writting.
Maybe you should try.

"event","I'm lost. I have no clue what to do. No one can understands what I am going through, because no one is me, and only I know exactly how I am feeling, Here I will try and write it out for you: Lets say you spend all your time and energy on this one thing, this one thing that all the sudden vanishes in front of your eyes, and there is nothing you can do about it, but its some of your fault that it vanished, and some not your fault, well what do you do. Its like you are forced to make life altering decisions that you dont know how to make. The only thing you have is feelings, so you go on those, but those feeling only will lead down the wrong path, and knowing this you still go, because its the only thing guiding you. These feelings that you think are right but are not, because you have made stupid decisions before only on emotions. Its like you strap your self in for the ride and then see how it pans out. And these decisions that I have made about this certain thing, I have no clue if its the right decisions. When you devote yourself to one thing for a long long time, you cant just drop it, It doesnt seem right to just drop it, and you think to yourself, I could never just drop it, but then when you do, your confused, because all you ever thought, never came true, you lied to yourself the whole time, basing all you had on your emotions, and your emotions traped you. They made you believe something that wasnt true. Maybe at the time it was true to you, but then as time went on you realized it was never really true, you realize that it was all a trick, a lie, somthing you made up in your head to feel secure about yourself, to make yourself feel wanted, loved. You came up with these false feelings because you thought at the time it was all true, but now when everything is over, you realize that nothign was true, at the time maybee it was  but not now, I mean how could it be true now. You told your self that this one thing would be in your life forever, and you would do anything to keep it that way, well what if you realize thats it partly your fault you lost it. You didnt just lose it, it was your fault, after making a promise to never let go, you cut the string, you left the place, all on this one emtion that turned out to be false. So your just left so sit and think to yourself, ""all my decions based on my feeling were wrong, and never worked out, it only led me to more and more hurt."" There were good and there were bad times, but it never worked out. Now there will always be a place in my heart for that one thing, but can I realy be to sure about that, I mean ever other promise I've made, I've broke, So I guess all I can do, is get on the ride and wait till it all pans out. I gotta have faith that the decision I am making is the right one, hopfully for my sake it is, but lifes kinda like that, you have no control over anything but at the same time you have all the control.  See I have a little advantage now, I got God. I have faith that my future decions will work out. Thats all I got, so I'm holding on to that. NOW problably this makes no sense, because probably I am just rambling, but it comes from my heart, it might not make sense to you, and thats ok, you would have to be me, to fully understand."

Block City 
by Robert Louis Stevenson 
What are you able to build with your blocks?
Castles and palaces, temples and docks.
Rain may keep raining, and others go roam,
But I can be happy and building at home.

Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea, 
There I'll establish a city for me:
A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,
And a harbor as well where my vessels may ride.

Great is the palace with pillar and wall,
A sort of a tower on top of it all,
And steps coming down in an orderly way
To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay. 

This one is sailing and that one is moored:
Hark to the song of the sailors on board!
And see on the steps of my palace, the kings
Coming and going with presents and things!"

I have friends at school, but none are christain, none can help me keep on task. I need to stay strong, but I feel I am getting weaker. Someone help me. Today at church we continued on this serious we are doing, about HABITS, like habits that help you become stronger in the lord, the first was HANG TIME WITH GOD, which is basically spend time with god, go to him daily. Today we talked about ACONTABILTIY, which is having a freind that is trying to become stronger in the lord as you are and being there for you, to tell you if your doing somthign you shouldnt or to be there just to talk to about your day. And Chad said that we should meet with them daily. I have no one at my school, that I already even kinda know that is like that or even goes to my church, there all in the 9th grade campus.

So I was like, ""UHHHH, oh yeah I dont have any friends"", NO JUST JOKING. I said ""I will invite SWEET and Becky to go, but then I realized SWEET had to babysit so I was like well alwell, atleast Becky can still go"". So I was excited cause my other best friend could go, I was freaky out, So I called her and was like ""Hey you busy"". And she was like ""NO"". And I was like ""Well you want to be, me and my mom are going to the movies, you wana come."" And she was like ""SURE"". So then we went. We saw the movie Pitch Fever, ya it was awesome, It could of done without some of the sex sceans but its was still great. Anyway SWEET WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BABYSIT, A ONCE IN A GROUNDING TIME I CAN GO OUT AND YOUR BUISSY AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH. anyway got to go to bed, I have to get up early and help bob out in his garden, IF IT DOESNT SNOW. well acually I will probably be up for a little while longer, well here is a quick thought for you:

Everday I wonder why
Why things go bad everytime i try
Try to get close and friends push you away
Try to fall in love and only the pain stays
Life is never easy
And relationships are always hard
But through the good and the bad
Things usually work out in the end 

A lot of things have changed between us
Maybe that's why my life seems so tough
Going each day from class to class
And all I can do is watch u pass
Everything has changed for the worst
And inside it really hurts 
Now I have to rely on my friends
To get me out of this dark hole that never ends"

We rode into town the other day
Just me and my daddy
He said I`d finally reached the age
And I could ride
Next to him on a horse
That of course was not quite as wide

We heard a crowd of people shouting
And so we stopped to find out why
And there was that man
That my dad said he loved
But today there was fear in his eyes

So I said daddy why are they screaming
Why are the faces of some of them beaming
Why is he dressed in that bright purple robe
I bet that crown hurts him more than it shows
Daddy please cant you do something
He looks as if though gonna cry
You said he was stronger than all of those guys
Daddy please tell me why
Why does everyone want him to die


Later that day the sky grew cloudy
And daddy said I should go inside
Somehow he knew things would get stormy
Lord was he right
But I could not keep from wondering
If there was something he had to hide
So after he left I had to find out
I was not afraid of getting lost
So I followed the crowds
To a hill where I knew men had been killed
And I heard a voice come from the cross

And it said father why are they screaming
Why are the faces of some of them beaming
Why are they casting their lots for my robe
This crown of thorns he hurts me more than it shows
Father please...cant you do something
I know that you must hear my cry
I thought I could handle a cross of this size
Father remind me why
Why does everyone want me to die
When will I understand why

My precious son
I hear them screaming
I watching the face of the enemy beaming
But soon I will clothe you in robes of my own
Jesus this hurts me much more than you know
But this dark hour I must do nothing
For I`ve heard you unbearable cries
The power in your blood destroys all of the lies
Soon you`ll see past their unmerciful eyes
Look there below...see the child
Trembling by her fathers side
Now I can tell you why
She is why you must die 
THIS SONG IS POWERFUL, LISTEN TO IT"

Everything I once new, all my relationships, all my friendships have changed, and especally my relationship with god. My life so far, has been way off track. I have put on a face of smiles but inside I was a wreck, I was never really happy. Even the people closes to me they made me happy but when I got home I was miserable all over agian. But things have changed, god came and made it all better. He healed me. He gave me these christian friends that are cool to hang out with. Now I have my times where I am all depressed but most the time I feel happy. God gave me christian friends and a christian youth group were we can all go and be toghter and worship and learn and grow. I went to this youth group before but it wasnt the same. It was differnt. No one knew who I was inside and some still dont. Some still dont know the pain I feel. This pain that I am dealing with, and others feel the same pain,and with them I can share and then be there to listen. God has worked in my life and changed It all around. I'm not going to waste anymore time not doing what god had planed for my life. I am ready to do it. And now I accually have people my age wanting to do it to, and be there to be accontible. So when I say that everything is changing thats what I mean. Becky, Sweet, those two I feel are like there with me. They understand and they are on fire, just as I am, and we get along, and I can start a  revolution with them and know that they have my back and I theirs. SO THANKS YOU TWO. You both are really making a difference in my life. You are more than friends to me. You are spirtual buddies, ones I can call on for help, or for strength. The only thing that matters is giving fully to god, and doing his will, and when you do that, you will live a much better fufilling life you cant even dream of. So lets grow togther. Here is a peom about how you SWEET and you BECKY impact my life:
BACK ME UP
Before my life was shape less
my life was incomplete
I'd never really let god work
and let him guide his sheep
He took me by the hand and lead
and said now travis follow me
but me being my stupid self
said no god let me lead
I ran to far ahead of him
into this aweful place
I told myself who needed him
When It looks like I can run this race
but then when I steped out on my own
it was made clear to me 
that when you turn your back on god
there are many really aweful things
things that can hurt you
and make you do stupid things
things meant only for hurt 
and distorting all your true dreams
but then god placed you in my life
to lead me back to him
so thank you for being there
and being such a good christian friend
you lead me out of that place 
a place I shouldnt of been
now were growing strong in the lord
lets let it never end"

"event","I just got done taking a nap. It was fun because for about three hours I wasnt grounded but I was in a world of dreams. My dream went Like this:  I was standing In a field of lawn gnomes and they were real, they were upset because I wasnt paying them enough to stand in my yard, my yard was about three hundred acres, it seem as if it went on for years. Anyway their he was the head gnome, which out of all the gnomes was the tallest standing at about 3 feet tall. He was demanding that I give them a raise. He was telling me that if I didnt he and the others would attack me. So I stood there and took his badgering and when he was done, I told him straight off ""NO"" so he whistled and called the rest of the lawn gnomes over, they were all dressed in war outfits and had knifes, So I ran. When I got far enough away I stopped and called Amanda Sweet and asked her if she could help she said ""Give me 10 minutes and I will have a full army of Leprechauns right there to fight."" this was good because Leprechauns hate gnomes so in ten minutes they were there and we had a full fledged war on our hands. It was brutal but in the end the Leprechauns won. Then they left. Out of what was left of the gnomes I took and used in my yard in the back. Now in the back yard there is a huge pool and Girl gnomes so they were happy even getting paid 2 dollars and 50 cents a day. 
Cool dream huh, yeah I was ungrounded and watching a war between two close relatives, it was great. Anyway Now I am awake and am very bored. Leave a COMMENT about what you think of my dream. anyway got to go to nothing here is a quick poem
Roses are red 
Vilotes are blue
I love leprocons

"event","I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooobored. I cant take this, there is nothing to do. My court mail came in the mail today, so I am glad to get that out of the way. It will feel good to pay my dues and move on with life. The courts have some really cool programs I can get into, I am looking forward to it. I feel so sore from working at Bobs house. At first I didnt feel it but now its starting to kick in. I didnt think cuting down eight bushes was going to make me sore, but I guess it did. I cant wait for church tomorrow it fun. I can hang out with amanda, and becky and all the other cool guys/girls. Also I love GOD so it great. anyway here is a poem about how much We need each other and why we should go to church:

WE NEED EACH OTHER



I once was like a coal
All lonely and dark
When Jesus came and touched me
With His Holy Ghost spark

Then I became an ember
Glowing with His fire
And serving the Master
Was my only desire

But as time went on
The assembly I neglected
And my spiritual life
Became seriously infected

As an ember burns out
If its not with the others
Our spiritual life will also die
Without our sisters and brothers

For we must come together
As Gods family
And worship Him as one
In spiritual harmony

So forget the little differences
And forgive one another
For then the world will see Jesus
In the love we show each other

And as the day approaches
Of Jesus returning
We need each other more
To keep the fire burning

So Christians every one
Lets walk hand in hand
Then with God we will conquer
This great and awesome land.

After all I am grounded and getting out of the house is great. Even if it is doing work. Well got to go get in the shower. Travis Walter OUT......................................Ya.............

Right then says I , <BR>but the other end was in such a mess <BR>it was a job I just had to attend .<BR>I pulled out weeds, dug up roots , <BR>then I thought while I'm at it I may as well extend the rockery .<BR>So there was I with rocks around me <BR>and a rose pruning job that turned out to be a mockery.</FONT></P>"

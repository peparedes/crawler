"event","<b><font size=""4"">@_@ School is driving me crazy. The semester is almost ending, last day is May 10th, and that just means its crunch time. I have a paper due friday, and a project/presentation about the Odyssey due next week. A friend and I are doing a sequel to the odyssey, we've done alot of research so its going to be pretty good we hope. Im doing the art and he's writing it. Alot of work to do because I just dont want to draw characters that have no meaning behind who they really represent.

So much to do for the project and I'm also working on some Gackt pictures for a birthday present a couple of people and I are working on. Got a tough couple of weeks coming up, wish me luck -_-;"

"event","<b><font size=""4""> Ahh, I feel so relieved. I had to do a 7 page paper that was due today and Im over with it!! I feel so much better. Now I have a couple of projects to work on though, but fun ones. First, I'm working on a drawing of Gackt fighting those guys that he shows in the DIABOLOS concert. It will look pretty cool hopefully. I havent started drawing the actual picture yet because I'm doing a sketch of his outfit. It's the redemption outfit but its different than the one he wears in the game so I have to get all the right parts of it. Then I have to do a project for school which isnt so bad. A friend of mine is writing a sequel of the Odyssey and I will be doing the artwork ^_^. Plus all the other school work I have but its not as annoying as it will be when finals come  around @_@."

Thats all for now, gotta go to........schoool.........."

"event","<b><font size=""4"">I was going to ask for a request in a community but they suggest that I offer something in return when I do that. So here is what I was offering, I just wanted to share it with everyone else too.

"event","<b><font size=""4"">Live journal eh? Hmmm, at first this seemed kinda girly to me, but I'm not going to be bitching about shit that happens to me etc, I'm going to just show the world what interests me and why. The main reason I joined this website was because one of my associates told me that its a good way to keep up with J-rock news, etc ^_^. But I dont want to be some sort of leech, so I guess I'll be active here. Just for the hell of it im going to number my entries by chapters and give them cool titles :), it seems more professional that way ^_^.
I also need to make my page look cooler @_@.

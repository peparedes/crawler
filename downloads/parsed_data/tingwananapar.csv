"event","I want to go back to Vegas. That song by T.I. &quot;so live your life, heeey heeey heyyyyyy...&quot; (I guess it's called &quot;Live Your Life&quot;???) reminds me of Vegas. Probably because of The Hangover (such a funny movie!) and the fact that I saw that movie while in Vegas. :)<br />Also reminds me of mister PKH. Phong Kim Ha..... blah!<br /><br />I need to do something of the world.....like go to vegas. or nyc.

"event","Can you believe it!? My work computer contracted a virus! The BLOODHOUND VIRUS!! Soo scary! Now I get a new tower. Yay! But not today. It doesn't seem to be a matter of urgency for anyone but me! Well, whataya expect? Poor computer, I got to know her so well...and now she's moving-on to a better place. All the spreadsheets, all the work orders will be lost. I guess that's what I get for not ""backing up""! How was I supposed to know!? 

Viruses are scary! I hate them! Where do they come from!? Why do people like spreading these diseases!? 

A skunk died under my bosses house, and now it smells like skunk in the office! Ugh! I'm gonna pass out from holding my breath!"

"event","Here I am in the office, all alone!  I just got back from lunch, I went to my grandmas house and saw my cousin (Natalie, of the world!). I took like an hour and a half....YIKES! Oh well! Ok, so to answer everyones questions (well, just Kats, but still) I work as an office assistant at an asphalt  plant, resurfacing  and reconstruction dept. I am no longer with Phong. He was my boyfriend for about 4 and a  half  years, or longer  even... oh well, we had too many problems! We've been broken up for about a year now and I'm not seeing anyone else...haha! Oh man, I used to love getting drunk at carnivals! It was the best! It sucks growing up, right? My buddy Carmen and I don't talk as much as i'd like, which is a damn shame, cause she is soo soo cool! My sister talks to her still so if I wanna know whats going on with her, I can  always just ask. Since noone is in here, i'm gonna try singing REALLY REALLY LOUD! Let's see, i'll sing some B-52's and some Ashlee Simpson!  Oh, I love my job! Let me know  if i'm  singing too loudly, oK? Happy  Friday all!"

"event","WooHoo! April Fools Day! 
Ok, so how many others, like me, were made a 'fool' of today?! I completely forgot that it was April Fools Day! It should be a National Holiday, celebrated by all! They should advertise, months in advance, at Target or Wal*Mart or something, and decorate like crazy, with all those classic novelty toys that still manage to fool some of us! April Fools Day decorations-GALORE! About as much hype put into the Christmas season, should be put into Fools day! Enough advertising to make sure you're fully aware of and fully ready, come April 1st! People need to be made the punch lines of jokes, or at least made a 'fool' of! 

It helps remind us that we all have our very own unique sense of humor, which we express in ways that fullfill our need for amusement. 

Phong got me in a text msg: ""Valerie you are SOO STUPID! Seriously why are you like that?! Hahaha J/K! April Fools Day!""
When I read the first sentence, I was shocked and thought he was serious. Yup, that was his (poor excuse of an) April Fools joke! Still, it managed to make me laugh out loud in the bus! 

Mother Nature got me BIG TIME! She made me believe it would rain. She started off with some scattered sprinkles. I thought it was gonna start pouring soon after, and I would get to go home! We get sent home when it rains hard at the zoo. It was just a tease, and no hard rain fell til after i had already started closing, which sucked cause i had to finish putting things away in the pouring rain! YEESH! She got me good! 

I got denied for another credit card i app. for! Master Card. I need money and i NEED a car! 
Kitten kept me up most o the night again. Her name is Sangos Kee La La! Cool name! My lil sis thought that wonderful name up...with the help of Cartoons i think. 

All in all, it was a cool day! No stupid customers. Yeah, cool day! My Life As An April FOOL!!"

"event","Okay, I am writing this journal about yesterday!

I had fun yesterday man! Me and Phong went to see 'Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind'. We went on his bike(RC51). It's cool, cause you don't need air conditioning since the wind is blowing right at you, although I was wearing a helmet! That movie is GREAT and I think everyone should go watch it! My lil 4 week old kitten still keeps me up at night and the mom is starting to reject her! I don't like feeding her out of a bottle cause it isn't as healthy as the moms' milk! My sis is watching 'Ghost World' in the background! My stepmom said this computer had a virus when it really didn't! Apparently she didn't want anyone else using it! 
Today is my Sunday, and I have to go back to the crappy Zoo tomorrow. Hopefully, i'll go to the beach today! I hope work's cool tomorrow! My 'Alannah Hill' slip/shirt came in finally! It's so lovely!"

"event","Well This is my first journal ever. I doubt anyone actually will read this! This is a little strange! Hmm...Today work was ok...! Sebastian, my cool friend, didn't go to work cause of his Senior picnic at Magic Mountain! So, it was just me, Lena, and Melissa the manager! We worked at silverbacks, the Ice Cream stand. The coolest thing about working there is Sebastian! :`(           He wasn't there!
   My sis, my cousin, and sevas didn't go to work.Weirdness! Carmen worked at Flamingos as usual! I need a car! I walked up to Silverbacks with Kat, so that was cool! They moved her to the train which made her all mad! 
          Damn, what a boring fucking journal! Well this is my lame life! My life as a ZOO EMPLOYEE!"

"event","Shesh.. I mean, I knew it ment alot to my family but not THAT much. I threw a dinner at my house for my family and some family visiting. Fun huh? I thought it would be, but it turned out to be a nightmare

Mistake ..1: ask them how there day went. (this is how the huge thing started) 
There reply: ""We went to PTown and saw two men kissing."" 
The little boy abou the age of 6 said, ""wow, adaddie kissing a daddie.. *gets cut off by my mom* -- ""Stupid huh.. Silly silly people.""

I flipped.

Hardcore.

I lost it in front of an 8 month old baby, a five year old boy, and a 6 year old boy. I couldn't take it, I totally lost it. I've had to deal with so much SHIT from my family I snapped. I told them my opinion on homosexuality and explained it to the little boy that some people in the world today fall in love with somoen they feel close to. I told them just like your mommie and daddie, it's the same love, and the same family, it's just they fall inlove with someone like them. Then I pulled my mother aside and told her my feelings on how it offended me that she said that. Seeing how most of my friends are either bi or gay. I am a very very big lesbain and gay rights suporter. I hold it close to my heart.

Mistake ..2: Brought up my opinions on religion. And accidtenly slipped that I'm not cahtolic anymore. They asked me what I was... I stood my ground and told them the truth. Satanist and wiccan.

They flipped.

I told them that it's not really what they think, and that both of those religions are completly diffrent, but both have qualities that I protray and follow throughout my life. I explained it to them. 

They still flipped.

Thy asked me how could I be both. And I explained it to them.

They freaked out. Disowning me and what not.

Then they voiceed there opinion. ""You're a stupid whore who knows noting. Your opinions don't matter, and you don't understand anything yet, you'll fall in the light of jesus, you have strayed but will come back""

I respected there opionon but proudly told them my opinion on jesus. About how He was a real person, but I dont beleive he is 'god'. There is a god. Somewhere. But not the way that the catholics look at him.

Sitll nothing, they kept flipping as I sat there in my chair, being pushed down and down digging myself deeper in my grave.

You can try and change me all you want, you can fucking disown me for all I care, but you cant ever take away my opinions or my veiws or the way I live my life.

Sorry, I just had to vent"

Three of my friends in the course of two weeks are being deploid into iraq. In the past two years three very close friends of mine died. And four friends are moving far away. What is this world coming to? Seriously. I'm going to be the only one left on the cape! What the fuck?! 

This makes me sad. Seeing as how All my friends are older and I'm stuck here. On the cape. With my guitar and old sparrow coffe mug on the grass at snows library. My life is becoming a ghost town slowly...

Well now that I talked about death it is tradtion to talk about life, and birth: Eric and I are doing great! we are back together and happier then ever. I'm back home.

Thursday is a huge concert at the juice bar, go or be dead.

No one cares since it's Anna, ""They sweet little girl."" Oh well, I better be nice and sweet, I get away with alot more. :p  I'm so tired, aI couldn't sleep, yet george claims he called me at 1 and I was sleeping and woke up and was like, ""Hey.. yeah.. great.. bye"" THough I don't remmeber any of that. -_- Ahwell. So yeah, Hazel, if your reading this, I miss the sheeeeet out of yah I miss seeing you int the library. When are you coming back down? COME BACK TO ME! :p
 Nothing specail has been going on with me. George keeps coming to lunch at school, even though he doesn't go here, and everyone looks at him like he's some kinda of punk ass bitch, who they don't know, and wanna ""Get the scoop"" NOt to mention all my guy friends who don't know him, and don't like Ivna, want to make sure he's ""Suitable"" for me, so they see this huge punk ass kid, wiht this mean look to him, and they are all like, ""Fuck you"" And give him the ""Parently-dad-stare-down-don't-touch-my-daughter-or-ill-shoot-you"" Look. which is kinda funny, cuz I'm not sure if george notices it or not, but he seems to grab me and pull me closer or kiss me deeply when they stare at him. Anyway's everything going good wihjt him and i. I seem to fall more and more in love with him every day, and every time I see him. I'm so tired. Lol, how manuy times have I said that?
Oh! I fized my room up again, I put this deep red curtain over my huge windows, and skylight, and it makes my room give off this red glow, really romantic and pretty, and then I have my sweet smelling hhhuge candles everywhere, so everything glows, and I sit on my couch and play the guitar. I love it. It's my get away from the cruel cruel world. If only george can be in there perminintly, and we would have a TGI friday's and a big bar in the closet. << THEN my life would be perfect.I should get off linem byt you know what/ I aint gunna, and you wanna know why? 'Cuz I CAN! BITTTTTTCH! Actaully, I think I'm going to go, I'm getting bored, and I'm runniong out of thangs to say. Oh yeah, one more thing. George is coming to the homecomings! Tech friday! Nauset nect friday! CAN'T WAIT, Becky-pete-meg-tony-liz-paul-brad I Alexis, nicole, and coral, I can't wait untill you guy's mee george, I haven't seen all yall in the longest time, I an't wait to see pretty )And handsome( yall look. ^^

 I'm sitting on the couch, watching TV and wishing I was dead because I'm so sick.
And someone special comes walking through the door with his Cumbies work shirt on, and sneezy, sick, but happy smile, and I hear ""Hey beautiful"" From behind me. Knowing the fimilar voice I turn around and flash the biggest smile I've smiled in the past week. He took of work for 15 minutes, drove down to my house, and plopped down next to me, and put my head on his lap and rubbed my head untill my headache went away a little bit. Kissed my hand, and forehead, and told me how much he loved me, and how one day I'm going to be married to him, and we can sit like that for the rest of our lives.

Some people just click, and were ment to be for each other. I lie in his arms on the couch watching TV, sick and feeling like I'm going ot puke, but when he smiles, or I feel his arms give a quick, gentle squeze around my head, all the pain, goes away. I feel so safe, protected, happy, loved in his arms. I can't even explain it. The way he looks at me, the way he talks about me to his friends, everything... Every minute I fall more and more in love with him. If anyone hasn't noticed, I'm not the kinda girl who gets a boyfriend for two day's, and brakes up with him. 'm the kinda girl who goes into a relationship with al hopes for a long life together. I know I'm 15, btu I've always been that way. Ever since I started dating. With steve, I thought I was in love, and I went into that relationship looking for a long term one. And then with Ivan, It was a year. I thought I was inlove, and sitll love him as a dear dear friend,  And now george. And to clear up any uncertanties, George will not use me, or rape me, or any other shit you all are thinking of. I know he's older. But he's not that older when you think about it. 19. That's not THAT old. And he's not going to rape me. we were best friends for over a  year, and now we've been going out for a month and a half now. He's had plenty of opurtunities to take advantage of me. and has he? No. An dif he was going to, he would have already, let alone he wouldn't 1. wait in a doctors office for three hours
2. wake up at 5 everymorning to call me and wake me up and drive me to school after his every night shift from 3-midnight.
3. Take me over to his house every day after school to spend time wiht me
4. Take me to the chocolate sparrow and buy the 5 dollar hot chocolate for me when ever he can
5. Spend his entier pay check spoiling me.
6.Let me drive his car (If any of yo have seen me drive my jeep, or any car for that matter, you wouldn't even want me LOOKING at your car)
7. Stop smoking because it made me upset even after he's been smoking for over 6 years.
8. Devot all his love, and everything he is to me, and only me.
9. Drive all the way to school just to walk me to class, even when he doesn't go to the school, and got kicked out when he DID go. <<
 Would a guy who's done all that, and more, be using me? I don't think so. All I know, is that I love him more then anything,and he? Well, he calims he loves me more. :P
But he SO know's I love him more. :P

I love you george."

With the bedsheets in her cell
Threw myself on fires for you
10 good reasons to stay alive
10 good reasons that I can't find
Oh give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
Oh give me one reason to be beautiful
Oh and everything I am
Love hates you
I live my life in ruins for you
And for all your secrets kept
I squashed the blossom and the blossom's
dead
Oh, give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body, so sick in his soul
Oh, and I will make myself so beautiful
Oh, and everything I am

My love burns through everything
I cannot breathe
Miles and miles of perfect sin
I swear, I said, I fit right in
I fit right in your perfect skin
I cannot breathe

Hey, baby, taste me anyway
Oh, you were born
So pretty oh summerbabe

And fading like a rose
Give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body, so sick in his soul
I'll give you my body, just sell me your soul
Oh, and everything I am will be bought
and sold
Oh, and everything I am will turn hard
and cold
And they say in the end
You'll get bitter just like them
And they steal your heart away
When the fire goes out you better learn
to fake
It's better to rise than fade away.....
Hey you were right
Named a star for your eyes
Did you freeze did you weep
Turn to gold, baby, sleep
Hey honey mine
I was there all the time
And I weep at your feet
And it rains and rains"

Ivan and I are now officially just best friends, he has alot on his plate, and so do I, and we just need to spend time apart.. maybe in the future we'll get back together.. but I honestly don't think that will happen. 

 I'm now with George. George Ellis. I wake up every morning with a text message, or a phone call from him. Saying ""Love you annie... Soo much.."" ^^ I love having his arms around me, his fingers intwined in mine. For all yall who don't know him, he's 19, has flaming red hair, 5'11 or something (alot taller then I), muscular, yet right between his shoulder blade and his chest is this soft muscule that is perfect for my head when I'm laying my head on his chest listening to his heart.
 I've never been happier. My parents love him, his parents love me. ^^

Though, Last night we got into a car accident, and the rest of the night, he wouldn't let go of me, I just sat there in his arms for about 3 hours untill the tow truck came. And surprisingly, we were both laughing, and smiling during the entire thing.

Before the car accident we went  into hyannis, and got him new shades, and I made him drive me over to Toys'r'us, and we were just laughing, and running around in there. ^^ We saw little babies, and big teddy's, and I made him ride that cute little pink bike. ^__^;

So now, this one little week at the end of summer. I got a new room, I got a new love, more respect about myself, and soon a new school year.

I have 5 guy's who are madly in love with me, and want me, and keep comepting over me. I'm not sure if I like it or not. I don't know how to react really. Almost every day I keep getting told I'm so hot, and sexy, and beautiful, and sweet, and perfect.

 Erm.. I'm not. Incase anyone has noticed this is Anna we are talking about. The Anna who planned to run away to California. The Anna who plays guitars all the time. The Anna who always smiles the retard smile. The Anna who listens to every kind of music and likes to rock out to the umpa loompa song in the car with her best friends. I'm just strange. xD
 
 Sometimes I think all these guy's.. it's like it's a big joke.. like any minute everyone's just going to go say, 'You've been punked!""

..Any minute now..

Well, it's coming, I know it is. :p

I'm not sure if I should be flatterd by all this.. I just.. I don't really know how to react. And I don't think Ivan does either. Ivan treats me like poo, he's only nice when he wants to be, though, these guy's... treat me like I'ma goddess. a treasure that needs to be loved and cared and hugged and keesed all te time.

I love Ivan, alot. But.. there's alot of stuff latly that makes me feel like he really doesn't love me anymore.. I don't know.

 I've noticed something... that I know others have not. Love meets no age. 2 year old. 15 year old. 21 year old. 86 year old. From the day we were born, we were born with a soul, and a heart. Anytime in your life, you find that person.. that special person... just for you..
   Anger.. yelling.. tears.. hugs... and kisses...



 ""I Love you so much...More then anything.. please believe me...""


When you're in love, and you havn't seen, or talked to that person in a day, it feels like ages. Long, cold, ages.. But then... when the prince shows up at your door... in the darkest moment... after the most horrible argument, that you started... not him... and he comes all the way across town... just to hug you.. and says he's sorry.. for something he didn't even do... And hug you... and doesn't let go... untill all the tears are gone... and that special smile is back.. and takes your hand... and you and him sit on the stair way.. with your head resting on his chest... listen to the perfect warm rythem of his heart.. as he holds you as tight as he possibly could...
 When you start to shake, as you hear your father start to yell.. and hit  the wall, and slam down on the table.. knowing that you must have done something wrong... and you start to shake.. and cry.. knowing whats to come.. and knowing that your knight in shining armor must leave soon.. and the knight holds you even tighter... and whispers in your ear.. "" one day.. I'm going to take you away from this.. and we'll have a family of our own.. and a big house... with many gardens outside.. and little children running around.. and I'll always be there to protect you.."" And you stop trembling, thinking of the wonderful life to come..

 When you feel complete in the arms of someone..

When you can close your eye's... and see yourslef sitting on a porch.. with a rose garden infront of you... with little children running around, playing in the garden.. when you can see yoru self an old wrinkly old lady... with much wisdom... lieing in a warm bed..and he roll over.. and see a gray haired man lieing next to you... and you think to yourself... 'Even though apperance has changed.. there's that man, that held me so tightly in the darkest time..""
 
 You know you are in love."

  I haven't updated in a while, well, all plainly, I'm just lazy. New rules have been set down for me, 'cuz an older friend of mine drove up to my house, parked out side, and snuck in the back to talk to me. Well, I got caught, and am now underhouse arrest. I got in another row with my mother, and I have to Pay to do my own laundry. I'm only aloud one towel, one pair of sheets, and the clothes I have. I can't use their money anymore, and since I'm flat broke, and it seems no one wants to hire me, I'm screwed. But little do they know, I still have that credit card from old navy they gave me. It's a charge account thats hooked up to my moms credit card.  So if all fails, I can at least shop there. xD Soon I'll have to pay rent,my sister thinks that that is insane, since the rest of my brothers and sisters didn't have to pay even when they were out of college and needed a place to crash until they are on there feet. I kinda see this as a way to get on my feet, and I'm not sad about it, I'll feel proud when I get to pay my way through life, and wont have to depend on the 'rents for everything.
  My mom's off at jury duty, and my dad couldn't care less abotu what I was doing. So thats why I'm on the computer. (I'm not aloud on at all this summer anymore, and I can't use the phone unless someone calls ME.)
 And surprisingly, all this and more, and I'm still happy. And that's all because of one person. Ivan. He came over yesteday, and just made me feel... so special, and loved. 

 I'm limited to an hour of TV everyday, and I already finished my two books I bought on Martha's Vinyard. Which, by the way, despite the company, it was so beautiful. There was this one time there, it didn't last for long, but I'll always remmember it, my mom said something funny, and we all just laughed. Everyone of us. Mom, dad, mike, and even me. Taken, it only lasted about three seconds, and then my brother said something, and pissed me off, and I just walked into town by myself and then relaxed at the pool. *sigh*
  So the next day, we left for Cape cod. Well, they told me to bike ahead. So I did, and they told me to go the wrong way. So I did, thinking it was the right way. After about 4 miles in, I realized that nothing looked the same, I didn't reconize anything from the way we came. So I called my mom's cell phone, and she didn't pick up. So I called about 14 times. And no answer. So I started to bike back and rememberd the right way that I was sopposed to go. So then I biked another 6 miles to the farry. thinking I would pass them. Well, I didn't. So I biked 6 miles back to the hotel maybe for sure I'll pass them. So then I biked back, and I was stranded in this middle of what looked like farm country. I called Ivan, to see if he could look up on map quest to see where in tarnasion I was. Which, I realized after he told me the road, wouldn't help, since I had no money on me, and my p[arents had my farry ticket. I was screwed. So I kept calling my mom's cell phone, again and again, but no one answerd. I called Ivan again, starting to panic because either way, I would be screwed, even if I were to not find them, I wouldn't have money to get a farry back home. So my mom FINALLY called me back, and said they went to get lunch after the realized I was gone. Grrrreat. I was sitting there, cold, hungry, with no money, and just a bike and a cell phone with no more minutes, and some dirty clothes in my backpack. Arg. So I biked back to where the *said* they were, Turns out, they were already at the farry. So I called my mom and said, ""I'm at the hotel again, where the hell are you?!"" She was stunned I biked into the middle of Martha's Vinyard, twice.  ANYWAY'S it turns out I biked 18 miles of extra waste. (I'm not exagerating the length, I have a sped domiter on my bike)

 Well, I got introuble for getting lost, and I was shunned to the bottom of the boat, and ragged on the qhole way home because I ""Blammed them for my own mistake"" BUt little did they know, it was rather enjoyable down there on the boat. A very nice man opend this big window for me, and I leaned out and took in the salt air. There was this segull who flew along side the boat, and it looked like it was stuck in mid air. Then I sat back in my chair, and read my book. I couldn't really concintarte, so I put it away, and looked out onto the ocean, listening to my music. I love the ocean. Almost more then I love Ivan. It's so peacful, so calm, yet so deaadly, and holds so many secrets. yet, it's a world of it's own. It has no limitations. It's there, with it's powering waves, and un controlable mind. I love it. It's so free. And birds. The birds can fly where ever there little hearts desire.There are no rules. There are no laws. There are no road signs, it's just air, or water, freedom. Something I will always long for."

"event","<P>Well, I'm here in the library, It's 9:18, and I don't have a final now. I asked the librarian to use this computer, but she's like, ""Well, I'm not sopposed to let you use it... because it's sopposed to be closed... but since you are such a nice girl, I'll let you use it."" I was like~ ""'K. Thank you."" And flashed her my fake ass smile. Well, I hope Ivan does not get kicked out of his spanish final. He *needs* to take this test, and no offense, but he kinda has a big mouth towards the teachers, and he'll prolly, well, mouth off or say something to aggrivate the teacher, get kicked out, and sent to the guidence office. It happens every day. *sigh* But I still love him, and he will do great in life. My, on the other hand, will prosper in sorrow, and lonely-ness. Don't tell me it's not true, because I know myself better then anyone else on this earth, and I hate myself. The people who really know me, (Family, some friends) All hate me, because they started to get to know the horrible sick person I really am. I wanted to walk down to the beach, but I don't think I can. I wont make it back to the busses on time prolly. *sigh*</P>
<P>&nbsp;My dad's getting a PC in teh studio. So Maybe I can sneak down at like midnight, go in there, and talk&nbsp; and down load stuff. Being the sneeky person I am, will prolly work.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I never realized untill now, how sneaky I am in his studio.. When before I was locked in that other room for 6 or so hours, I was sent down in there to do work. *remembers* I had... three parties in there while I was ""Sopposed to be working"",and I had Ivan and george drive back and hang out in there. And now since we are getting a good computer there, I can sneak in and burn stuff, and downlaod stuff, galore. I'm a little devious child.</P>
<P>&nbsp;My mom called me the devil child yesteday. And I quote: "" YOu listen to devil music, and you say horrid words (I said, 'wooowee, is he <STRONG>sexy</STRONG>') And you are a slutty whore who has sex in the back room under the blanket with your boyfriend!!""</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I said sexy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Sexy.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM><U>SEXY.</U></EM></P>
<P>God forbid I ever ssay the word <STRONG>sexy</STRONG> again. Because only that word can cause trouble. *sigh*</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway's I'm off to the clay room again, see if I can clean or something, and then off to guidence to see if Ivan got kicked out. (most likely) Oh! And he added to his live journal </P>
<P><lj user=""redmageivan"" /> , so be sure to read his first entree. Most llikely it's his last too. :P</P>

"event","I don't know about you, but it makes me full blown sick, not to mention pissed off, when *friends* of mine not only make fun of Ivan, but start dissing him. If only people around me could see the Ivan I know. The one that holds my hand when I'm shaking either at Hell Boy, or the thunder while we are standing with his arms around me in the rain. Or the Ivan that makes the best jokes, and makes me laugh so hard I start to cry. Or the Ivan that kisses me ever so smoothly, and wispers ever so gently into my ear, ""I love you."" The strong, gentle perfect man I grew to know and love, with all my heart. But people today, are shallow and concieted and feel that they need to rat on people because it either makes them look ""cool"" or think it's ""fun"" to shoot people down. It's sick. And it shows me that this world was once a beautiful piece of the universe, and people like them, turend it cold and prejeduce. And it makes me angry to know that people on this earth can't get along even if their life depended on it.     The only way this world is going to end, is by humans. Humans fighting for more. Because we want more. we are never satisfied. And the select few just preach about how the world sucks, and how that people suck, and do nothing about it. I, knowing from much experience, and as a living example, promise to not judge people. People judge me all the time. Either as the fat brat, or that weird girl. I might suck at a few things.. ok more then a few, but I DO know how to treat others with kindness, and RESPECT. And try to treat them that way all the time. because for all we know, they could have dark and horrid secrets that make them who they are. And they could be hiding that great person down inside themselves. I may be weird, but I'm proud of it. I don't have to satisfy everyone, ( family, friends ext) But I do, and will, untill I die, make the people who are worth it to me, make them happy, and smile."

With my arms in the air
as a tear rolls down my cheek
With a smile on my face
My heart filled with love and grace
My hands dance around in the air
Under the moon light
My white silken dress flows behind me
My long brown hair flows gently around me
The stars twinkling in my eyes
As a gentle man comes up behind me
And takes my dancing hand
and holds it in his
As he weaves his fingers into mine
They are entangled and create one hand
We dance together under the moon light
As the heavans rain down upon us
Angels with there dark wings stand on the pure white clouds
Watch as two people's love
Form one love
I want to feel like I'm walking on a cloud
I want to love like never before
I want my love to be returned
I want to feel the love in my heart
In my soul
On my lips
As he holds me tightly
Whespering in my ear
.. I love you..
..I'll be there for you..
..forever and always..
..And when we depart from this world..
..we will still be strong..
..our love will overcome..
..Our love will stand..
..You will always be in my heart..
..Untill my heart is no more..
As he brushes my hair lightly back away from my face
And looks into my eye's
Only he can unlock my trouble
Only he can unlock me
Only he has the power to set me free
Only he..
Only he will can return my love..

I shall love thee, until thy love is gone.
And thy love will alway's be there."

"event","I realized something scary the other day.
Ivan's graduating june 2005.
And he might not be going to college.
So there is even more of a chance of him going.
Not to mention my brother or sister.
My grandmother once told me this story, and how her first love went off because he was drafted.. He never came home. The last thing he said to her was, ""I love you, and I will come back, and we will start a family, have kids, and grow old together.."" He never got the chance to do that.  It's a very scary, not to mention sad thought to know that the one you love, will never come home, and probably died, alone, cold, and scared. For this country or not. It doesn't matter. Love is love. War is war. And it sickense me to see that the people who draft other poeple don't fight themselves. We hardly honor those people who have passed away. We read in the news, "" Two soilders brewtally beaten to death"" we are sad, but get over it quckly. And most look to it as entertainment. People laugh, say its stupid, say they were stupid for going. But they don't look beyond that. That person is someone's child. Someone's love. Someone's daddy. I don't know about you, but it touches my heart, and brings a tear to my eye, thinking that people just laugh at it. And if this draft happens, some people might not have a choice, and will have to leave there baby daughter, their mother, there love, and leave to fight. I don't see in any freedom for that. I don't see anything that we should be proud of. It's something that needs to stop. And stop for good."

"event","Duuude! Well after school today, Jessie and I stopped by the Hot Chocolate sparrow and met up with some people. So then we walk down to the middle school and roam the halls, laugh at the pretards. (My new name for incoming freshman) We pretended to be seniors from the high school, and then walked down the skate park after we got kicked out of the middle school. Then we ran into the administartion office to get a work permit for jessie, when our bus driver from the highschool stopped the bus with all the pretards in it, and she asked us if we wanted a ride back home. So I mean, I can't resist a free ride, plus we were screwed if not. xD
   So then she let me use her phone to cal jessie's mom to tell her we were on our way, since they thought we were runnign away since we didn't come home. So then we got off the bus, and the problem was that bus didn't stop at our house's, so she just stopped anyway's. xD Then as I was walking down, the bus stops, and some cute pretard pulls down the window and screams ""You dropped your jacket!"" And throws it out the window, with a remarkable catch. ^^ Then, as they bus started up again, all these kids I knew from the highschool who were driving by, beeped the horn and were like leaning out the window screaming ""Hey! Anna!"" lol, and the pretards were looking at the comotiona and thought I was some senior from the high school, and they all turned bright red, because they thought jessie and I were some exchange students walking around the school aimlessly with my music on loud. XD
 I Loved oit. xD"

Today was beautiful. ^^

I felt alive. ^^

There is this really pretty pink blossom bush down Seview, and there's this 'secret' pond  a good friend and I found, and we claimed it as ours, well I went down there again today, after school since no one was home, I couldn't get in the house, so I dicided to walk down and sit in the sun, well, While walking there I saw a good friend pete, and we both walked down, and I sat under the blossom bush, and he just stood there looking at the water. I didn't see him do it, but he went behind me and shook the blossom bush and the pink blossoms rained down on me. He gave me this big smile and watched me dance around in circles. I felt so beautiful. ^^ I felt like all eye's were on me, and I didn't care, I felt beautiful and alive. ^^
    Lol, I'm not cheating on Ivan if thats what you think, I love Ivan so much, I would never hurt him like that. There is no one in the world that can replace ivan. And there in no one in the world who can replace pete. I love pete as a best friend. And I love Ivan as more then any person I know, more then a best friend, more then a brother, More then anything that I can put to words. 

  It's the perfect spot to be when you need a pick-me up, It's in a thick forest like woods, and then ray's of light shine down through the leaves and hit the water and the Pink blossom bush. ^^"

"event","People are so shallow. Is it just me? Or do other people see this? Material things are taking over. And soon, when we realize that thats not everything, It will be to late. We will think we have nothing. When you die, you can't take any material thing with you, you take your memories, happiness, tears, thoughts, with you. Why build up on something, that you can never keep? I don't understand it. I will never understand it.


 I admit it. 

 I'm a cruel person.         I'm           weak, shallow and have a cold heart.                The only one that can melt that heart, can only melt it when I'm in there arms. I've found that person. I've found those people. When I am in their arms, my heart melts, I feel love, I feel their kindness, and I feel there heart. But when they let go, I get scared again, My heart freezes over, and I become an empty body. I'm selfish. I have everything I girl could ever want. But I want more. I ened more. I feel empty. And the only person who can truly fill that happiness is gone. There might be another  person who can fill it, who will come along, I think there might be, I see him, I can touch him, he is real, yet, I only feel whole in his arms. It's stupid, but its true. It might sound stupid to you, but it's not to me, I feel it, I see it, When I'm in his arms, My smile comes back."

And then I cried on the way home in Ivan's arms on his shoulder, as he held my tightly and kissed my forehead.I woke up this morning numb. Ate brekky, and felt a bit better, eye's still red and swollen. Then went online, and cried somemore. I am a horrible, sick, person. Who deserves nothing. I am a selfish brat. So I went up to my bedroom and cried again. I talked to Ivan some more, and dicided to meet him at the library to give him a bg hug and a kiss. My mother gets very sick, and so my dad instead of driving me to the library, my dad wants to drive my brother to the book store. Which is in Dennis. We are near the library. I ask again if he could please stop, Ivan is there waiting for me, you can pick me up on the way back from the book store. My dad gives me a sharp no.I ask again if maybe he can at least just stop in so he's not waiting hours for me to come. Again another no, but this one is louder, more cruel and leaves a very awkward tension in the car. We pass the library as a tear rolls down my cheek.  So we go to the book store. I sit in the car for 15 min. Thinking some more about how much I just suck. About how spoiled I am, how selfish I am. My dad ignores me for the rest of the day. My mom is still liing in bed, sleeping. I hope its not the You-Know-What. Because if it is, that means that I have it too. This is just the best day ever."

PLus I can hang at the beach all day, and then go to work. PLUS it's a bar, where mostly young kids hang at. Yes, that's right, more college kids. >< I have found it very very Ironic, that I, the Anna that everyone used to know and love, (I'm still a softy lol) But I mean I've changed. Alot. If I was to compare myself to the same time a year ago (8th grade) I was a loser. >< No, I'm not even kidding, Now, I'm a party person, who hangs out with way to many college kids. Great. Just great.
What's going to happen next? I mean if I changed this much in one year, then what am I going to be next year? I'm only a stupid little freshman, no matter how many older friends I am.
 Well all I can say, is I can't wait.

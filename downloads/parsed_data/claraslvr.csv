"event","So it's official. My parents filed for divorce today. There is a two month processing period so it should be finalized in April right in time for my birthday.

5 good thing I can be thankful for in this are:

1.) My parents have a shot at a hopefully happy new life.

2.) I can now declare myself as an independent on my FAFSA and taxes.

3.) The shower in Dad's new place might work better than our old one.

4.) ...

5.) ...Feel free to enlighten me..."

My newly learned lesson. 

I'm hiding in the library. Isn't that pathetic? And it makes me a little sad that the person I'm hiding from wouldn't be caught dead in the library, but I guess I should be thankful for that right about now.

That poem from an earlier post is by my cousin Laura, she is an amazing woman, she's been through alot and she still keeps smiling. 

I went to my first Harding Basketball game. The only thing I can think to campare it to is Lord of the flies. Not the players, the crowd. We were thrown out of the game back at my high school for booing. It was a respect thing. So it's wierd to watch everyone get so emotional over a game. I think that a good litmus test for girls to try on their guys is watching how they conduct themselves during a sport event. (sorry for how stereotypical I'm being)Some of the girls were just as bad. 

well I'm off to find a new hideout."

You seem to be straight forward, but you keep a lot inside.
You're laid back and chill, but sometimes you care too much about what others think.
You tend to have one best friend you hang with, as opposed to many aquaintences.
Some of your past dreams have disappointed you, but you don't let it get you down.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howdoyouliveyourlifequiz/"">How Do You Live Your Life?</a></div>"

re-gifting, indian-giving
re-covered couches left on the curb
that ambiguous look on your face, in your eyes - 
the whole of it running through your body, every nerve
flowing from every orifice
simultaneous contradictions - I want to beat it out and embrace it all at once
so high strung with emotions & the lack thereof
this necessity of physical release
Exhaustion.
the disregard
the disappointment 
And it's overwhelming.

words so easily spoken so easily 
forgotten
flabbergasted by your impenetrable, confounding ways

this anniversary of failure plagues me so
happiness is momentary
until I remember - 
Grief.
because I could have done more, done less
Hate.
because I don't care - but I do
Isolation.
because there are few who get it

is there any redemption?

"event","Well, I'm back home in Amarillo! i washed my car for the first time ever today. I love carwashes. I think I will do it more often. 

I also had my first Chimichanga today. I didn't really want it. I asked the convenient store attendant for a bean and cheese burrito. She just basically informed me that I was either dumb or a foreigner cause apparently she has never heard of such a thing during her expansive career of working in gas stations. She sugested that maybe I meant a chimichanga. I asked her if it had beans and cheese in it. She said no it had meat and cheese in it. I told her I probably didnt mean that then since I wasn't much of a meat afficionado.She told me again that she had never heard of such a thing and was pretty sure I wanted a chimichanga. I was late and I wanted to make it in and out of the Tule Canyons before sunset because of deer so I just said yeah, gimme one of those I guess. She looked very pleased with herself. So ya, I ate it and it wasn't bad. My mom was a big health nut while I was growing up so I have a sick fascination for greasy gas station foods. I acually liked the chimichanga."

"event","I've been thinking alot lately how driving a force being wanted is for humans. We spend so much time and energy vying for acceptence and validation from others.And yet even with that goal conquered we aren't really happy.

My friend called me yesterday to tell me his mother had finally come forward to tell him about his father. My friend's mom has never hesitated to let said friend know that he is living proof that birht control isn't a sure thing. She reminded him on a daily basis what a burden and mistake he was. He never knew his father. Was never even given a name. We spent three months researching before we were able to get his fathers name age and current address. But my friend threw it all away in the end. He said he already had one parent who didn't want him, possibly two, but atleast so long as he never met his father it was only a possibly and not a certainty. His mom called him to get his support on suing his dad for child support. His dad just found out he even existed. She promised my friend half the money if they win, she just needs a paternity test. She won't win this law suit. My friend told her he didn't know and to leave him alone. Now my friend will get to know for sure if his dad wants him or not. My friend is already terrified of rejection.I asked him once why he kept trying to please his mom when she always tore him down for it. He said because she was his mom. LIfe can be cruel sometimes.

And then of course there is my Mom who is in the middle of a divorce. Want to know what the irony of it is? By the time she finely changed and tried to salvage the marraige it was too late. My dad doesn't love her any more.And she still loves him.She went out and bought new clothes and had my little sister take her to get new makeup and teach her how to apply it.It must have really hurt her pride when none of it worked.My dad got sick this Christmas and mom ket taking him tea and medicine and giving him a blanket and fixing him things to eat. It's actually quite depressing to watch. I asked my dad later if he would miss her when the divorce is finalized in May. He paused for a long time and thought, Which means no. Then he said well, i don't think she is really going to miss me. I told him I thought she would. He just said, ""but I think it will be all right, don't you think?"" I Said,""yeah"". But thats what makes it so horrible. Is that what makes it o.k? The fact that at some point in the future, everyone might finally be allright again? I think its terribly sad that people do rebound so perfectly from something that tears so many lives to shreds.I truly do believe everyone wil be o.k. in the end.But until then, until may, my mother wakes up in her bed everymorning to the knowledge that she is unwanted by the man she pledged her life to. She cooks for that man, she cleans for him, and for what? none of it will matter. When she goes to bed at night he still won't want her, and tommorow when she gets up to do it all again, she'll just be one day closer till when he leaves her for good.

And then there is God. Who seemingly wants us depite our continual lack of interest in him. Explain that one to me. Wow this seems to be growing increasingly morose.Perhaps it's time for bed.

Whom have I in heaven but you?
And there is nothing on earth
that I desire besides you.

My flesh and my heart may fail,
but God is the strength of my heart
and my portion forever.

"event","I made christmas cookies today. As soon as I rolled out of bd this morning mom pounced. I don't think I'm much of a morning person. I need Breakfast or a shower or something to wake me up. Plus I don't sleep to well here at home. I have to share a bed with my sis who hogs the covers and I wear my coat to bed cause my parents don't like to turn the heater on. But thats home, and I'm glad to be here.

Any way, my mom made Kara and I finish up her cookies while she went to a friends house. My christmas spirit is pretty wan early in the morning, but as any dutiful daughter would do, Kara and I rose to the occasion. After the second maimed ginger bread man Kara produced I started to get an idea. We had rocking horses, gingerbread men, snow men, and candy canes that can be made into a pretty decent replica of a rifle, not two mention colored sprinkles and icing. So we created a festive war scene. The snowmen won nturally cause snowmen are impossible to kill, so we had a series of glaring snowmen holding up maimed or dead gingerbread men with eyes rolled up in their heads and tongues lolling out of their mouths.The rocking  horse calvary didn't fare so well either and there was one teddy bear casualty. We actually had alot of fun. Then mom came home.

In our defense we left her the snowflakes and stars and christmas trees.She just picked up a ginger bread man with a bloody stump who looked to be screaming in pain. (we did a pretty good job on him I thought) and just stared at Kara and I. Sensing that her christmas spirit seemed to be a bit shakey at the moment Kara and I went to town to give her some time to regain it.

It's been really nice to be home. I've gotten to see a ton of old friends and guess what ?! I passed Statistics!!!! Which is a miracle considering that I quit going to that class altogether after the first month. I had only two grades out of the four possible grades in that class a ""D"" and a ""F"". I'm no mathmatician, but even I can average that and there is no possible way I could have gotten a ""C"" in that class. I'm not sure how it happened, I don't even really care. I love Dr. Eichorn. She has just earned a very special place in my heart."

"event","Well, I'm home again and it's christmas time. Which means time to volunteer more hours out at the state school.My father got me started volunteering back when he used to work there. I actually really enjoy it. So anyway every year at this time, dad volunteers to play Santa and Kara and I are his elves who take pictures of him with the kids for a nice donation of three dollars for the state school. It's one of my favorite jobs. The kids are always so excited. Upper level clients are allowed to come see Santa too. Otherwise he just goes and visits them in the homes.This year C. came out.We'll refer to him as C.  For those of you who don't know what a state school is, they are a governement based program designed to care for mentally challenged clients. C. is an upper level client with a dual diagnosis (mental health and mental retardation). He is very sweet, one of my favorite dance partners at the dances the school hosts for them. We take pictures at the dances too. A few years back my dad gave him a photo of him with a volunteer dancer from McMurry and he started crying. He told my dad he was just so tired of being alone and more than anything he wanted to be married. How do you comfort him when he says something like that? Clients with dual diagnosisies? have practically no hope of leaving the school. Anyway, C. came to see Santa his year. He told dad that he wanted the entire south park series on DVD, but then as he was walking away he turned around and said,"" Os Santa! I forgot! What I really want for christmas is to not be MHMR anymore, I want to be more like my friend Tony."" What can even Santa say to that? One of the other volunteers piped up with,""C. I know Tony and trust me, he's not that normal.""

I still don't know what to think of all that.I feel horrible. How many selfish things have I asked for for christmas over the years? I don't understand why C. is the way he is. Does God make people like that? I can't wait till heaven when all of us are equal.i can't wait till a time comes when C. won't have to be lonely anymore."

"event","My roomie and I stayed a day later at school cause she's the R.A. for our hall and has to wait for everyone to leave. Consequently we were left to take out the trash, do the dishes, and clean the fridge out because our suite mates have already left. I will never eat again. I can not adequately describe the pungent odors, bright splashes of color, and array of textures we experienced tonight. We are taking a break right now to settle our stomachs. As of yet its not really helping.
We had 15 containers to open and check. We've been dreading this all semester. Everyone kept hoping someone else might do it. Candy and I lost. We started out with noodles, candy covered her face with her shirt while I opened the lid. Imagine very fuzzy tarantula legs, only not quite as black. Candy screamed and started retching. Quite literally shrieked. I nearly dropped the container. We would've been done for. Then we moved on to the rice. I hate rice. I now have another reason. If not for the horrid smell it might not have been so bad, but it looked alot like purple and yellow fuzzy maggots. Candy hates maggots, worms, etc... Her eyes watered and the dry heaves started up again. Purple and yellow are complementary colors aren't they? We moved on to macaroni, what once might have been beans, cheese sauce, onion, and alfredo. i opened and cleaned the containers while Candy febreezed everything. Then we got to the sprouts. My first week of school here I bought ingredients for vegetarian sandwiches. Well Candy likes to organize. She moved my sprouts to the very back of the fruit drawer, someone covered the container with a sack of apples. I had no idea they were still in existence. I nearly cried when I lifted the sack of apples. We trashed the container. You couldn't pay me enough to open it. We went through 13 of the fifteen containers and I have a pretty strong stomach so I was doing o.k. Until the 14. Gravy. It had broken down. Gravy has a lot of milk in it. Have I mentioned my fear of milk? I will only drink it if:

1.) I bought it or am very close to the person who did. ( I need to know when and where it was bought.)
2.) It has to be 2 %. Skim is too thin, and whole is so thick it makes me want to gag.
3.) It has to be 4 days before the sell by date. You can never be too careful with this stuff.
4.) It can't be at the top of the carton. Those little white crusty things fall from the cap into the top portion of milk.
5.) It can't be remotely close to lukewarm.
6.)It can't be from the bottom of the carton. That means its been around for a while and those white crusty things will have settled at the bottom.
7.) It can't be from someone else's house. I wouldn't have had a chance to monitor it.

So we got to the gravy. Which had soured. I nearly threw up right there, and I can't throw up right now or my esophagus might start bleeding again. I closed my eyes and held my breath and now I am back safely in my room. There is a good possibility I will have nightmares about it. Can't wait to get out of here."

"event","I'm going home Saturday. I have to talk to my dad and it won't be a fun convo. But once we talk about it I can start returning his calls again when I get back to school. I haven't talked to him much this semester and we always talk. I've missed him.

Its been a wierd couple of days. A lot of sad stuff has happened, and I haven't really had anyone to talk to. But alot of good stuff too. I've gotten some answers from God, they make me kinda sad but they are good answers. I have a ""date"" to my last/only function as a tri-kappa member. He's a neat guy and ironically, asking a guy wasn't the hard part, finding a guy who wouldn't take it as me liking them was. Got to take a nap with a really cool friend of mine, nikki. GOd has blessed me with so many amazing people in my life.

I get to see SHad soon! and then he's coming back to Harding with me. Which is great. I've needed a close friend and confidant lately. Wish he wasn't always 10 hours away."

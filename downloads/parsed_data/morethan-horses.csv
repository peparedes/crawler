"event","Today was a nice day.

Pretty mucb no one was there due to some excursion.

My glue had leaked due to some dude breaking it. NO MORE WARM BABY:(

We got kicked out of our spot, for the ""Inability to keep it spotless"". this frustrates me because litter is revolting, and as such i always pick up after myself. and it is upsetting that some people are too ignorant and selfish to do the same.
So i was lost today. Homeless.
At lunch Ajax and I went to the drawing room (it was warm there). We got stuff from outside and used the squishing thing to squish it. Twas fun. And he made a face out a wire and pliers. and i saw his big artwork. and then some teacher whom i'd never seen before came in because class was about to start, and she knew my name! i was obviously freaked out.&nbsp;

Arr get away songs that aren't belle!

Nothing could make me upset today because of Belle. And I found myself to be less shy and more talkative than usual. I thank Belle for this. When I was bored i drew pictures of Judy and her Dream Of Horses. I wish I was in Sydney right now, for obvious reasons. Ok you can slap me for not shutting up about it, whatever.&nbsp;

But Don't be like that woman on the train yesterday who was frustrated with my happiness."

I've decided that i need to stop being so judgemental of people. I'm sure there are probably people laughing at me because I don't know the meaning of words, or my clothes aren't quite vogue or something. Maybe those girls in photography are ok to laugh at because they aren't polite to me. but apart from that i now propose that i shall not spend all media bagging everyone else in the class for having no brains. because they probably do have brains. 

and.

it's my birthday on friday. so strange. 17. my last year of innocence and getting away with things. i shall make the most of it. i have to. because as much as i want to turn 18, as soon as i'm 18 i'm going to not want to get old and wrinkly. 17 will be a fun age. it is decided. 

i am having a birthday brunch! hooray. even if it isn't on my birthday, which means that i won't be doing anything special on the actual celebration of the day i was born. just think. 17 years ago on friday i was some annoying crying brat. not a lot has changed eh?

apart from that life is usual. kids think i'm stalking them because i subconciously am. my ego has been inflated by people, hence i feel a sense of false security. and. (most importantly?) i'm going to the hairdresseers tomorrow. pretty hair!"

"event","eww i had a nightmare last night where eilise was an emo. there is pretty much my 2 less liking groups- emos and eilise combined. which made me think that i need a list of things i don't like.

THE LIST OF THINGS I DON'T LIKE.
1. eilise 
2. emos
3. snails
4. annoying people.
5. those short shorts that girls seem to think look nice when really they just look like sluts.
7. people who get stoned/drunk at school (these people fall under number 4, but i thought they needed their own category for being ultra pathetic)
8. cats. 

ok.. i need help adding to this list. ideas people ideas!"

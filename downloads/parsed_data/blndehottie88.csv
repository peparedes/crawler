Katie called him today and asked him what was going on, he told her that he doesnt know exactly but he just doesnt like me anymore, he did like me but all of a sudden doesnt anymore. i guess i just have to deal with it... i dont really feel the sadness anymore, it is pretty much all out of me. i dont want to waste a full day worrying about him anymore! its not worth it...

So i am still going to idaho for a couple months i will have fun. Jace, well he is in juvie! dont know how to spell that but you know what i mean! he called pulled over for drunk driving.. i seem to always fall for the bad guys! i guess it has just turned into a habit! ahwell

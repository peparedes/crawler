"event","last night was so fun, ash and i went to the kecoughtan/pheobus game....khs lost..,  but we saw soo many people there....donnie, paige and all their friends
paige and i were cheerleaders (monique and shaniqua) and donnie was dancing with his black dance group, SOOO hilarious!!! 
we got soo soaked, and paige almost fell down the bleechers (?)
then ash, donnie, and i went and got donnie some food...he didn't get much..then donnie called his mother and asked if we could come over and partay, but she said no, cuz the house is a mess....
then we left before the khs band came out (which sucked cuz i really wanted to see them) and went to my house, then ashs mom came and picked us up and we went and got mcdonalds chicken nuggets..YUM!, then we got to ashs house and got some more food..got on the computer, and then went to bed
we woke up at 8 this morning and was sooo tired...but then we went to drop ash off at the ballet studio, and then her mom dropped me off at my house..
i have nothing to do today, but i will find something!!!"

"event","okay...today i went to bay days with courtney, caitlin, ashley, and katie....we had a good time even though the beginning was a little rough. malorie (ashleys friend from ballet, also my history teachers daughter) went on the ""ring of fire"", it was awesome...we screemed soo much!! and then i went and got a vanilla milkshake but it sucked cause all it was was sweet milk....
then we went and played this game where u have to shoot a water gun and it hits a little bulls eye? and if u win u can pick any prize, and my cuzin, caitlin, won and got me a monkey!! then right after that i met this guy donnie, cool guy from what i know, and we went in the haunted house...it wasn't scary but it really stunk in there...there was this black kid infront of me and he was really funny...he would turn around and scream and then i would scream...when we got out katie and courtney said that they could hear us screaming!! they had microphones in the haunted house!!!
this year bay days wasn't really crowded, it wasn't as fun as last year..."

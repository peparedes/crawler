Voldemort's the only person who seems to want my company lately.  And I must say, it's rather gratifying.  Knowing that he's the almighty Dark Lord, and he wants nothing more than to have me join him.  The only thing that's kept me from joining at all was the hope that someone here really would either fall in love with me, or someone would actually give me a chance at being their friend.  Granted, while Angus really does seem to care about me, I just can't see myself with him.  And with Gus...well.  What can I say?  I think he's the one guy that could have pulled me out of my depression from Lucius.  I loved that bastard more than I loved myself.  But he just threw it all away and went back to Severus.  Not that I care.

But back on track.  Gus.  The poor bloke's still on about that hex.  But I bloody told him how I feel, and if he wants to be with me, well, he knows how to get a hold of me.  He <i>is</i> a wizard afterall.

He has a girlfriend.  Why is it that everyone I fall for has a significant other?  Oh, that's right, because I'm a coward and can't say anything to them until it's too late.  Gus just didn't realize how I felt before, because I hide my emotions too well.  Sure, I cared about Lucius, and I still somewhat care about Angus, but I honestly think I'm starting to fall in love with Gus.  He's just always there for me when I need him.  No matter what.  I know I can talk to him about anything, because he always listens, and I do the same for him.

I don't know.  Perhaps I'll just end up having my heart broken again.  And then I just don't know what I'll do.  Probably go join the dark side for good.

Although, I'm sure I could go to the Great Hall rather than hide in the Library, but what is the point?  Everyone is already so engulfed in their own lives, I'm rather sure that no one even reads my writings.  Surely, no one has said anything about that poem I wrote, so I'm nearly positive that I could call the lot of you a bunch of sodding pillocks, but even then, most of you probably don't even know what that is.

To be perfectly honest, I'm considering giving this little magick journal up entirely.  I've got a private one that I use rather frequently, and even though no one ever reads this one, at least with the other one I'm guaranteed secrecy.

Now i will tell you what i've done for you
50 thousand tears i've cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me
Don't want your hand this time i'll save myself
Maybe i'll wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when i thought i'd reached the bottom
I'm dying again

I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through
I'm going under

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So i don't know what's real and what's not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So i can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again

I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through

Scream at me i'm so far away

Last night...was simply perfect.  Well, for an evening.  Lucius and I get along famously...so I suppose that is why I didn't have a problem giving myself to him last night.

Part of me just wants to let myself fall for him completely, but the other half is the one that I must listen to.

I can't just let myself give into him.  From what Sev has told me, he can be rather...conceited at times, so I have to remain watchful.

Even though he really means a lot to me...I sort of have my doubts, since the whole thing with him and Severus didn't go to well.  I suppose I'm just afraid that he'll lose interest in me.

Lucius and I went for a walk, and he showed me this lovely spot in the grounds that no one goes to.

He thinks I'm going to be afraid of him.  He doesn't have a clue as to what I've seen and done before.  Before I came here, there was one boy...But I'm not getting into that at the moment.

I'm not sure that I trust Lucius yet.  He says that he and Severus are still through, but that ring he wears is just too...suspicious.  I mean, the icon that Sev used at one point...had those rings in it.  I'm not stupid.  I'll find out what's going on.

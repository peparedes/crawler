"event","&nbsp;I've been doing research lately and I've finally come to a decision. 



I'm going back to school. 

I only need three semesters and I will have a new degree. 

Yes, I know how much work that entails. 

Yes, I have the full support and blessing of my parents. 

Yes, I do realize I will be a zombie at the end of it all. 


Then my plans are to either transfer to ETSU or to the med school pre-program at the UT Memphis campus.&nbsp; If all goes well, I should have a new degree in as little as six semesters.&nbsp; 

Boo-ya! 


Okay, I'm entertaining the Charlie and his supa-cute puddy Downy tonight so I'm off to be&nbsp;a proper hostess.

Hello Fall, it's been awhile.&nbsp; The temperature dropped today.&nbsp; I say dropped but you should read 'plunged"".&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; That's right, plunged.&nbsp; Yesterday I strolled around in nice balmy 78 degree weather, this morning I woke up and it was hovering around 49 degrees.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Needless to say, it's a little chilly.


As we speak, I'm wrapped up in my happy flying pig Quillow (folded up it's a pillow, unfolded it's a quilt, get it?) with a nice hot cup of Irish coffee, blogging, and watching 1408.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So far so good.

Work was fairly decent today.&nbsp; At least I didn't get yelled at.&nbsp; And I wasn't fired.&nbsp; I guess you could say things are looking up.

I'm thinking about going back to school.&nbsp; I've almost got my plans finalized.&nbsp; I just need to check with my parents and we'll have a nice family discussion about it and maybe I'll post on it later.

Ok, it's time to get back to 1408.

Recently Buddy has not been feeling too well.

Sucky does not like Buddy to feel bad.

Then I noticed Buddy.

Rather, parts of Buddy.

Sucky ate Buddy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Literally sucked his scales and fins and stuff off.

I'm serious people.

Sucked. His. Scales. Off.&nbsp;

Fins too.

This is bad, very, very bad.

Eventually we'll have a brand new fridge, new dishwasher, lots of cabinets, a new front door, new floors and Frank is supposed to start working on the bathroom next week.&nbsp;

"event","My parents' house was vandalized last night.&nbsp; Some punk(s) decided it would be great fun to throw&nbsp;paint on any and everything standing still.&nbsp; So they did.&nbsp; Beige paint.&nbsp; On blue cars.&nbsp; On red brick.&nbsp; On the heat pump.&nbsp;&nbsp;

My dad is furious mainly because he just had his car in the body shop from the Corolla Incident (which I didn't blog on but to give you an idea, our neighbor didn't give enough clearance whilst making a turn and scrapped her car down the entire driver side leaving a fabulous amount of body damage) and now where the beige paint dried or mostly dried it's damaged the new paint job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

As far as the KPTPD can tell, they were the only house hit.

Mom's supposed to call me back in a bit.&nbsp; I'll keep things posted.

"event","Well things certainly took a turn for the WTF?!?&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously peeps, wrap it up.&nbsp; It's not just for Christmas presents.&nbsp; (Theme of office X-mas party this year.)

Digression.

I actually left work at a descent hour today.&nbsp; Mildly surprising considering I usually log about 10 hours in the Hovel.&nbsp; I call it that lovingly.&nbsp; The Hovel.&nbsp; It's my very own semi-corner office (the last one in the hallway before the fileroom) and despite being cramped and full of papers and files I'm sure I'll never really get through,&nbsp;it's my own personal, tiny&nbsp;corner of Big Girl In The Real World Space.

I have yet to decorate it, except for the occassional McDonald's or BK toy that I acquire.&nbsp; Oh and Crappy the Reindeer.&nbsp; I can't forget Crappy.&nbsp; I'm tempted to put my diploma up but I'm afraid that might be a bit pretentious and maybe not a little bit stupid considering the others who have degrees have them in career-related fields like social work whilst mine is in English.&nbsp; On the other hand, I busted my butt for that $18,000 piece of paper and it should do something a little more than just collect dust (not that it doens't collect dust well, mind you, but really, it should quit being such a couch potato).

I have this urge to punch the wall, not because I'm angry (well I am sort of) but because I have this really perverse desire to know what it feels like to have every bone in my hand broken.

I am such a downer right now.&nbsp; Geeze.

Digression.

I have the cutest fish.&nbsp; Okay, well, Ir and&nbsp;I have the cutest fish.&nbsp; We have this nifty little tank with Ir's betta, Buddy, and my pleco, Sucky.&nbsp; They're hilarious.&nbsp; When we feed Buddy his pellets, Sucky will get jealous and when Buddy goes to eat a pellet or two or twenty Sucky will dart after him when he's at the surface and they'll get into this game of tag.&nbsp; First Sucky chases Buddy, then Buddy chases Sucky and so on and so forth.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time watching them do this.

I just looked at the clock.&nbsp; I'm never going to get up in time tomorrow.&nbsp; Crap.

Oh well, it's just the difference between going to work with unwashed hair versus being coherent at the buttcrack of dawn to get myself up to wash my hair.

And with that I think I'm off for bed.&nbsp; I'll post on something later on.

""Dude!&nbsp; It is a goth!""&nbsp; ""D**n! So it is.""<br /></p>"

"event","So I finally get a day off.&nbsp; Like a whole day.&nbsp; That I don't have to go to work/training/etc.&nbsp; I really don't quite know what to do with myself.&nbsp; Especially now that I've just about cleaned everything in my apartment.

Sorry I haven't called you back Tom, up until today I've been running around like a chicken with my head cut off.&nbsp; I promise I'll call you back in the next couple of days.

My aunt is planning this big Easter shindig that I'm supposed to attend on Sunday.&nbsp; She's asked me to bring a chocolate trifle though I'm not quite sure how I'll throw that one together.

Next week is supposedly the last week of training.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I've been given permission to go or not (this turn of events stemming from how I'm apparently inept at my job and the whole drama that ensued the last time I was in training.).

But anyway, I think I'm gong to finish scrubbing the sink.&nbsp; Yay for a clean sink!

"event","<p>I'm in this mood (my mother would call it a 'tear') to redo everything.&nbsp; Just gut it all and start over.&nbsp; And I do mean everything from this blog to my wardrobe to my home.&nbsp; Every.

"event","So I finally put upa pic on myspace.&nbsp; Go me.<br /><br />I'm still puddy sitting.&nbsp; We're watching <em>Dreamer</em>, well I'm watching it and the puddies are all pouty-faced because I won't let them go outside to play in the snow.<br /><br />Oh well, it's cold out and despite how cute they were rolling about in it all, they're nasty-cold and drippy.&nbsp; And this does not make for a happy L~bug when they come booncing in demanding to sit on her lap (all at the same time).&nbsp; So we are now shacked up and waiting out the happy little snow storm that's wrecking havoc on K-town's roads.<br /><br />I saw a lot of red trucks today.&nbsp; They make me sad.<br /><br />I spent most of the work day at C-L sick with a headache.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it was from lack of food, meds, or this nutty weather.&nbsp; I'm still feeling it a bit, not as bad though.<br /><br />And with this, it's time to get back to my movie.&nbsp; I'll probably update tomorrow sometime, provided I'm not making folders for 5 hours.&nbsp; I wouldn't hold my breath.<br /><br />*hearts &amp; hankies*<br /><br />L~bug"

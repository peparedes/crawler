Warped Tour was simply amazing/wonderful/great/orgasmic. Perhaps I will post some pictures later on, if I get really motivated to do so.

I just finished my end of summer mix cd. It's so amazing to listen to it and remember all the great memories I've made this summer. Perhaps I will post the track listing later on, if I get really motivated to do so.. heh. heh...

I am taking American government this year, and I hate it with a passion.

"event","<font size=1><font face=arial>I bought The Perks Of Being A Wallflower yesterday... I started reading it last night, and I'm almost done. So far, it's such an amazingly great book. I can relate it so much, and I think alot of other people can relate to it as well, even if they won't admit to it.
I've also cried over this book a few times. Is that horrible or what?  heh heh..

But, I would recommend this book to anyone. So go buy it or check it out from the library now...<p><font color=white>

Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Chops""
because that was the name of his dog
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
and a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
and read it to his aunts
That was the year Father Tracy
took all the kids to the zoo
And he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born
with tiny toenails and no hair
And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a
Valentine signed with a row of X's
and he had to ask his father what the X's meant
And his father always tucked him in bed at night

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Autumn""
because that was the name of the season
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
and asked him to write more clearly
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because of its new paint
And the kids told him
that Father Tracy smoked cigars
And left butts on the pews
And sometimes they would burn holes
That was the year his sister got glasses
with thick lenses and black frames
And the girl around the corner laughed
when he asked her to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told him why
his mother and father kissed a lot
And his father never tucked him in bed at night
And his father got mad
when he cried for him to do it.


Once on a paper torn from his notebook
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Innocence:A Question""
because that was the question about his girl
And that's what it was all about
And his professor gave him an A
and a strange steady look
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because he never showed her
That was the year Father Tracy died
And he forgot how the end
of the Apostle's Creed went
And he caught his sister
making out on the back porch
And his mother and father never kissed
or even talked
And the girl around the corner
wore too much makeup
That made him cough when he kissed her
but he kissed her anyway
because that was the thing to do
And at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed
his father was snoring soundly

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag
he tried another poem
And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
And a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door
because this time he didn't think
he could reach the kitchen."

I'm down here for the weekend for Steph's graduation. I don't have much time to write this, seeing as how I have to get dressed for the graduation ceremony in a few minutes. So anyway. I have had such an amazing weekind so far. I met the most awesome guy at the dance last night.  Danny. We danced the night away.  Yes. :)  We square danced, swing danced, and everything in between.    (Paula gooo away and stop reading everything I'm typing. It's not polite.)  Anyway, yeh, last night was so much fun. They even played Relient K <i>Sadie Hawkin's Dance</i>!!!! We I thrashed to it. It was simply amazing. So that song will me my official theme song for this weekend. And I even got a hug at the end of the night. Aww... :-D   I'l post pics from the dance after he sends them to me...
In other news... We got lost on our way back from Red Lobster. ...Don't get gumbo at Red Lobster. Just, don't. It's nasty.   Ummmm...yehh....
I would have gone into alot more detail with this entry, but as I said. I don't have much time. And Paula is making me nervous. Grr.. go away Paula."

"event","<font size=1><font face=arial>So I just got back from my homeschool group's annual bake sale.  I had way more fun today that anyone should ever have at a bake sale. Xenia came to 'help out the cause', so ofcourse we had an awesome time. 
We bought our traditional neon pink posterboard and made a sign, and stood by the road in the middle of Jasper holding the sign yelling ""You're not too cool for cake!"" at passing motorists. After doing that for about an hour we decided that we'd sell more stuff by walking/skating door to door. Jasper is not the best place to skate, and it's even more difficult when you're carrying around a huge basket of assorted baked goodies. We got to skate for a little while, but we mostly just took turns carrying the board around, but magaged to look <i>uber cool</i> in the process. heh. heh.
 We went to pretty much every store/business in town, and only made fourteen dollars. So after we we returned to the park, we went to Subway for lunch. The girl who made our sandwhiches asked me if I was in a band. Heh...
After lunch we went to a few random thrift shops, but bought nothing. Then we went to the dollar store. There Xenia got some awesome undies with garter straps, and we both bought a pair of metal play handcuffs. ...All we needed was some whipped cream and a whip.. hmm... ;-)
When we were walking back, we discoverd a shopping cart with a broken wheel in the alley behind Family Dollar. It looked like it could be alot of fun..  We took turns pushing eachother around in it, and waving to random people. We crashed once... We were laughing soo hard. <i>""It was soo Jackass!""</i> We got called immature by an eight-year-old. And had a blast on the merry-go-round. We walked to CVS and bought magazines, and then headed back to the park around 2:30, and headed home not long after...
So in conclusion.... Today was a fun day.<p>

I'm just starting to realize that I'm happy with the way my life is right now, nomatter how confusing things may be. I just feel like something big is going to happen soon, and it will change things for the better. Maybe my hopes are too high. But I have this feeling that something good will happen in the near future.
I don't really even understand why I feel this way now, since just last night I was so overwhelmed by everything. But today, I felt like a huge weight has been lifted off of me. I feel...great!

Anyway. I got <b>Copeland - In Motion</b> today. It's such an amazing album. Simply beautiful. Go buy it. Now! And apparantly I'm the only kid in this area to get a copy of it, since Best Buy only got in one today, and Target and FYE didn't seem to have it either. I'm just special like that I guess.  And I wouldn't have even gotten it today if it wasn't for my wonderful new friend Keysha at Best Buy digging it out of the storage room for me. Yay for making new friends! 
I also got <b>Gratitude</b> today. I havn't got a chance to listen to it yet, but I predict it will be amazingly awesome, since I have never heard any of Jonah Matranga's music that I didn't love.
I got a ton of assorted dirt cheap discount body jewelry today, and a really neat black and white striped shirt. Yay!

Well. That about sums it up.

Goodnight kids....<p>

Anyway, not much of interest has been happening lately.  I met a guy at the grocery store today when I was looking at the Easter candy. His name was Donovan. He said I was pretty.  He's on a cross country hitchhiking adventure, and attending lots of jam band festivals. We talked about Cadburry Eggs, Reese's Peices, M&M's, hitchhiking, and many other interesting things. Donovan was a pretty interesting/neato guy. We hugged.  It's too bad he didn't have a phone, or I would have totally gotten his number.

I ate at Sonic for the first time ever today. Sonic is officially the greatest fast food place ever! I got a Lime Slush and a chicken club toaster sandwhich. Those Lime Slushes are the greatest thing since sliced bread.

I also went to the mall in Lake City today. That place is the crappiest excuse for a mall ever. It was mostly deserted, except for a few old people sitting in the chairs in the middle of the mall. They all stared at me blankly when I walked by. It was kind of scary.
I went in Sam Goody, and some hip-hop type clothing store. I bought nothing. *sigh*

<i>(All of this was written on the 20th, but I just didn't get around to posting it until now...)</i>

The concert was a simply in-flippin-credible time.

My throat still hurts from screaming, and my ears are still ringing. Amazing. :-D   I'm not going to go into extreme detail about the concert, because it would take a really, really long time.. And I don't think anyone really wants to sit there for 40 minutes to read about it all.  Sooo, anyway....

We got to Wild Aventures around 12:30. Around 1pm, Xenia and I headed over to the ""Snow Days"" area of the park (fake snow, from a snow machine, ofcourse) and we passed the concert stage, which was completly empty, except for maybe three other kids standing by the fence. And there we got to watch Bowling For Soup setting up.  Then we played in the snow, while listening to BFS, and being chased by evil little kids who pelted us with snowballs.
We made a five dollar bet on which band whould play first. I, ofcourse lost...
 The first to perform was MC Lars...who is simply amazing...  He's a <b><u>post-punk laptop rapper</u></b> and the most original thing I've seen in a long long time.  He raps about stuff like Edgar Allen Poe, and England.  Everyone should  <a href=http://www.mclars.com>check him out...</a>
We got to meet him after the show, he is such an amazingly nice guy. We got autographs, and chatted for like 10 minutes. We talked about college, the Waffle House, Florida, and many other interesting things. 
After MC Lars, it was Riddlin Kids, American Hi Fi, then BFS. They were all excellect. We also got to meet AHF and got their autographs. And Xenia got her RK shirt signed by the singer from the band.
I asked every one of the band members what their favorite kind of pie and/or cake was. Good fun, indeed.
After the concert we went back to my house, and watched large amounts of music videos, coppied lots of cds, and watched Napoleon Dynomite. Hooray."

<font size=1>So, ummm...Happy Valentine's Day. I hate Valentine's Day.

It's rainy and, cold, and icky outside. It always seems to rain on Valentine's Day, why is that? Weird. 
The Valentine Bunny came to my bathroom this morning and left me a stuffed doggie, a box and candy, and a card... 
Hooray Valentine Bunny! :-D

"event","<font size=1>Soo... I just got back from the banquet not too long ago. It was okay. I'm just glad to have it over with. I think I sang unusually well tonight...I'm proud of me. Yup. I hung out with Steph alot. And I also got to hang out with Chris and Trey and all those people I hardly ever see anymore. There was lots of good food there as well. Lots of good sugary food. Yess,muahhhahahaa.... Cupcakes, brownies, red velvet cake, cookies of all kinds, etc... Sugary goodness. So awesome. 

I made a really neato LJ icon tonight on Animation Shop 3. But every time I upload it, only the first frame shows up, and it never changes.  If anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know. Thanks..."

Anyway... I've been cleaning my room for most of the day. I can finally see my carpet again! I forgot what color it was.. heh heh...  I've got to get my room looking all nice and clean by the 19th, because Xenia is staying over that night, after the Bowling For Soup concert...  And I'm starting now, because it's such a project, and also because I've been so busy lately with various things that I may not get another chance to do it between now and then....

The Valentines's Day banquet is tomarrow. I'm not too exited about that. I don't want to go. At all. I was hoping I'd get to play guitar and sing, but that didn't work out.  I'll be singing with Paula though, and Steph will play piano. meh..."

"event","Hellboy gets a call from Hasrah, after a long absence, and heads over to take care of the stoned and apparently very abused half-demoness. 

<lj-cut text=""Has, darlin', you're lookin' like hamburger in that nice boy's shirt."">


Sometime after Kurt had left Hasrah had awakened. She wasn't really hurting, the drug she'd taken had seen to that rather effectively. On the other hand, she still had a *whole* vial of the stuff left. She didn't often indulge in her own drugs, but the dreamy feeling she had right now was pleasant enough to tempt indulgence. Besides, it wasn't like she was hurting anyone, right? She'd managed to open the vial, but had also managed to spill a good amount on herself. Which had to be licked up, of course. And then there wasn't a lot of point to not taking the remainder of it. Sometime after that she'd lost track of the vial entirely. Along with the rest of the apartment. And the fact that she was hurt. What she did not lose track of, unfortunately, was the phone. Which could be why Jack's next phone call will show calls to Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Puerto Vallerte. And Hellboy. She vaguely remembered talking to Hellboy. Or at him, rather, as she demanded his presence, in between drunken giggles. It had taken several minutes for her to give directions that anyone could follow, and then she'd hung up. Or thought she had. She'd lost the phone after that, and couldn't quite remember.


And right after that is when there's the sound of the key in the lock - it takes rather longer than usual for Jack to actually make it work, considering how badly he'd been beaten. He drags himself in, tread leaden, and heads immediately for the bedroom to check on Hasrah...fearing that somehow Smith has followed him home, or come for the demon girl again. HE's bleary eyed..and there are weals already turning purple on his throat. But it's the concussion headache that's the worst, for the moment. He drops his keys on the dresser without ceremony, and sits down on the bed beside her.


Strange how paranoia makes everything seem worse. Especially the heavy knock at the door; one handed, three raps. There was the damnest noise in the hall -- like heavy clopping, not long after Jack got in the apartment, the heavy footfalls of one who doesn't have feet. That'd be Hellboy -- not Smith, he doesn't sound like a clysdale in the hallway, that Smith. Rather, big Red is there with a large box under one arm, his trench flapping about his ankles, and his gun tucked very unconspiciously beneath it on his right hip. Going out armed? Hellboy? Yes, regularly.


Hasrah is currently under the covers. All the way under the covers. And has somehow managed to turn herself around, despite the fact that lying on her stomach and wriggling around on the bed has *got* to hurt her ribs. She's bruises from head to foot yet, and her back looks like someone decided they wanted a Hasrahhide footstool, judging from the almost flayed-section. Thankfully all of that is currently covered up by blankets, and most of it by the button-down shirt she's wearing (mostly unbuttoned, true, but at least she's clothed. Kind of.) She's phone hunting. She can hear the damned thing beeping down here somewhere. At least, she thinks that's the phone beeping. The sudden presence on the bed next to her confuses her, and the knocking that seems to come a split second later makes it worse. ""Jack? Kurt? Big guy?"" Which one, who what where?


Celliers kisses her forehead - he hasn't yet noticed how very intoxicated she is. """"Yes, Jack. I've a story for you, in a moment."" And then there's the knocking on the door. With Smith's touch fresh in mind, Jack reaches into the nightstand by the bed, and pulls out his own pistol - nowhere near the equal of the Samaritan, but more than enough for an average human: a Desert Eagle. Back to the door, and he calls, more fiercely than he feels, ""Who's there?""


""H.B. Hasrah called me, gave me the number of the apartment -- she didn't quite sound herself."" The rumbling basso voice that echos out of Hellboy's broad chest doesn't belong to an Agent, at least! ""She here?"" A pause. ""Or she in trouble? She wasn't very clear on the phone.""


There's a muffled thump from the bedroom. Hasrah has managed to tumble out of bed, landing in a heap of blanket. If it hurts, she's not showing it, giggling quietly as she tries to pull herself upright, just to thump right back on her ass. ""Is okay, Jackie.. put the gun away. That's just Red."" Despite her bruised and swollen face, she's bright-eyed and smiling. Look! She found the phone!


Oh, god the confusion. Jack tucks the Eagle into its holster atthe small of his back. ""One moment, please,"" The hallway door is open - it's a very bruised and battered skinny English kid that opens the door, with an absurdly posh accent, like something out of a BBC miniseries. Whose jaw drops when he finds himself confronted by the immense figure before him. Only an instant before he recovers his composure, and waves Hellboy in. He peers back at the bedroom. ""Dear, can you get back into bed, or do you need me to help you?"" he wonders.


Seven feet of brick red, smelling faintly of dry roasted peanuts. That's Hellboy. The big man akes in Jack's reaction -- and his appearance with narry more then a lifted brow. ""Pleased to meet you,"" he rumbles, though it looks like he could be less pleased or more pleased; hard to tell with that craggy, blocky face of his. Still, he ducks into te apartment with that large box, and smirks quietly; that thing is filled with food. His tail lashes out to catch the door knob, and shuts the door behind him as he heads without err for the kitchen. ""Dear? Hasrah didn't mention she'd been domesticated."" He grins a little, though; pleased, definitely.


Apparently Hasrah didn't hear that. Or maybe she did, and she just doesn't care. Either way, she's still sitting in her pile of blankets, looking more like an overgrown kid herself than the sultry demoness she often affects, Jack's shirt all wrinkly and rolled up on her arms, the buttons mismatched and gaping. ""Red!"" she crows delightedly, lifting her arms up to him. ""Haven't seen you in forever and ever. Bad demon!""


Celliers inclines his head, though he blushes at Hellboy's comment. Doesn't even bother to stammer a denial, though. Instead, he leads the way into the bedroom - finally noticing that Hasrah isn't precisely her usual self. ""Hasrah, are you alright?"" he wonders, already offering her an arm back up to the bed. If Hellboy visiting makes her this perky, he's going to have to be jealous. When he's stopped hurting.


You get no hugging. Hellboy is unpacking what looks like enough food to last three months -- but then, he's a big eater and knows his own demon appetite, so -- if Hasrah needs recovery time, he knows what to bring. But he does eventually wander over to get a glimpse of the girl and then just shakes his head. ""Either of you two seen a doctor or do I need to get the first aid kit out now?"" he drawls simply, before he begins t take his coat off. ""Has, darlin', you're lookin' like hamburger in that nice boy's shirt -- and I'm seein' way more of you then I'm 'sposed to."" He glances to Jack as if to say, 'Hey, she's in your clothes, help her out!' and wanders his way back to the kitche -- and yes, fetches two first aid kids and some 'extras' he's brought by from that Big Box.


She's.....drunk? Jack peers at Hasrah, even as he picks her up tenderly (wincing from the results of Smith's tender ministrations. and tries to deposit her back in the bed. ""I shall have to get you a nice night shirt, I think,"" he murmurs, pulling the covers up over her. Hellboy gets a very grateful look. ""No, no doctor. I would be very grateful if you took a look."" Because with that build, he has to know *something* about demon anatomy.


Something? Yeah, like how to break it into little pieces, like Hasrah's talking about doing. ""why is she loopy?"" Hellboy asks, as he comes over to give the kid a look; yeah, he doesn't look as good as he could, either. Grumph. ""I'll give you both a once over. I'm qualified for emergency feild medicine, so I promise I won't leave you worse then before I go there."" He then considers. ""You able to cook, kid?"" He hopes so. ""Cause I'm leaving enough food to make the salavation army weep here. Now -- Has, baby, lets get a look at you."" And that's when he piles the first aid stuff back in the box and heads for the bed room So much for covering Hasrah up.


Hasrah doesn't make any fuss when Hellboy goes to give her a once-over. She's too busy pushing buttons randomly on the phone, though any serious probing will get the phone dropped, and have her shrieking in a heartbeat. It looks bad on the surface, she's a multi-colored quilt of bruises from top to bottom, but it's inside that's the worst. Her ribs are knitting, slowly, but they creak at the slightest pressure. Lord only knows how many of them were broken in there. The patch on her back that corresponds to the broken and ripped wing is raw, the skin flayed off of her. It's scabbed up, but the entire area looks inflamed, and she's not going to sit still very well while that's looked at. As for being loopy, well - there's an empty glass bottle sitting in the middle of the bed next to her that can explain that well enough. It's too small to have held any significant amount of booze, and the liquid clinging to it is sticky, odorless and all but tasteless.. and extremely potent. Her eyes stare up at Hellboy, the pupils enormously distended. ""Red, you'll make sure nobody hurts my Jackie, won't you?"" And then she gapes slightly, reaching for Jack's hand. ""I forgot. Jack this is my friend, Red. Red, this is Jack. Kurt says he loves me. I told him that was silly. Humans and succubae don't love each other, but Kurt told me not to be dumb. I think he's being dumb.""


Jack, herring-faced. He looks like he's been punched in the head, even if this can be excused as drug-addled ramblings. ""I...I am. I mean, I can cook. Decently, anyway. And you're very kind...I couldn't really..."" He falls silent, since Hellboy seems to know what he's doing. Far more than Jack does, anyway.


Oh my lord. Hellboy just sighs, goes into the bedroom -- and gets poor Hasrah naked. Well, not in the fun way. He is, however, going to bandage, medicate, and otherwise cover up many things, as well as consider what medication to leave. He went through hell to get some of this stuff, after all. But he talks softly and soothingly to her through it all; it's not easy, what with his large right hand, but -- still, he manages. Ignore the cries of pain and the soft rumbling of the big guy, Jack -- it's got to be done. Besides -- you're next. 

It should take a couple of hours -- if Hasrah needs another dose of something or other during that time, welll, Hellboy will his best. Still, he wants to make sure she's well taken care of, and answers anything with noncommital sounds, smiles, rumbles, and, ""Shh, Hasrah, hold still.""


It is a far more sober Hasrah that's lying there when Hellboy is done than when he started. Sober and white-faced, and in considerable discomfort, though it's the sort of discomfort that's all ""Sorry you have to hurt, but now when you heal up you'll be healing up properly,"" rather than the comforting slog of lying there hoping everything knits back together as it should. She can still feel the drug in her blood, dizzying the edge of her brain, but the discomfort has taken the worst of it's edge away, and left her feeling slightly bewildered, and not at all happy.


Jack is profoundly unhappy as well, and not due to his own physical discomfort. He does his best to help, though that mostly involves holding Hasrah's hand, when he can. Generally just trying to keep out of the way - he's stowed himself in a little armchair in the corner of the bedroom, dealing with his own wounds as best he can, and occasionally leaning over to stroke her forehead.


Hellboy sighs softly once everything is said and done -- he goes to wash his hands up, and then move on to the next patient - Jack. ""AFter this, I'll put supper on for the both of you. I want you BOTH to rest today, got that?"" Jack! Strip! Your turn! ... Don't mind your big, red nurse. He's tender. Really. ...Grunt.


Hasrah clings to Jack's hand when she can. Isn't that sweet? And manages somehow to completely avoid looking at either him or Hellboy. The Big Red guy does manage to get a nod from her though her voice still sounds rather fuzzy and lost. ""Can't go anywhere, Red. Can't fly away. I'm grounded. And when I get out of bed Jackie yells at me.""


Celliers looks at Hellboy, not entirely comprehending, though he's willing to remove his shirt. BRuises where one of those freight-train punches hit, and strained ribs...and the strangler's marks at his throat. But worst of all is the concussion - he's wobbly as a punch-drunk boxer when he stands up again. ""Supper?"" he replies, bewildered. ""Thank you."" Not going to argue, for once.


""...You shouldn't even be walking around,"" Hellboy chides Jack, and then shakes his head. ""You're getting a houseguest. I cook, I clean, I'm a regular domestic, andI like to sleep on the floor. So -- until you two are functional, I'm not goin' anywhere."" And with THAT just -- decided! -- Hellboy gets up, an goes to cook for 'em. Isn't he nice to invade your home and tell you what's up? It's why he had to leave Magda's, after all...


Hasrah just stares after Hellboy, looking more bewildered by the minute. When he heads out to the kitchen, she turns to Jack, trying to tug him overi into the bed with her. ""Lay down with me?"" she asks him quietly, pulling the blankets down so he can slip beneath him. ""It doesn't do any good to argue with Red. He just picks you up and puts you where he wants you. Believe me, I know.""


Celliers still has that pole-axed look. But doesn't bother to dispute. Obediently, he settles into bed, next to Hasrah, looking far younger than his actual age. He'll happily curl up with Hasrah, and rest. Nice to have someone take care of him."

"event","Hasrah comes back to talk to Hellboy, as well as thank him in her own special way. When he proves less then receptive to her advances, she accuses him of prejudice against his 'own kind. he has to correct her on a few things.

<lj-cut text=""I don't do casual. I do love."">

Human. Hellboy hadn't -told- her to stay human. He hadn't even suggested it, quite. It was just.. easier, being human. The urges didn't roll so strongly through her as they did when she wore her other skin. That's not to say they weren't there.. they just weren't quite as strong.

What was strong was the urge to revert. She'd fought it a night, a day, and another night. When she woke the second morning, feeling the ache in shoulders straining for wings, she'd had enough. It was time to let the other out for a little while. It was time to fly.

All of that day had been spent in flight. Well, not all of it. There was the little matter of clothing appropriate to her demonic frame. Her own had been shredded, as was not uncommon. The last shirt she had borrowed from her ""roommmate"" had been shredded as well, when she'd changed. Unwilling to rip the one dress she had left, Hasrah had dared a trip back to her hotel room, and gathered what money she had left. Now, dressed in clothes that feel far more fitting to this form than Hellboy's t-shirts, she sits on the railing outside the window to his room, clicking talons against the glass.


He didn't really expect her to be there when he got up -- and so he hit work, and work hit back. Long hours, but when he's home, he's got a shower and Mcdonalds waiting for him. Not all bad, really -- just not all that good, either. Still, he's just getting out of that shower when he hears the tapping. He's got good ears, Hellboy does, so he towels off quickly, gives a holler of, ""Just a minute! Keep yer shirt on!"" And comes out -- sans shirt. Just those shorts that he fills out --well, fills completely, rather.

And imagine his shock when he sees what's at the window.

HE doesn't hesitate to go open it, frowning. Not because she's flying, or demonic, or anything -- but because, ""Don't you know how ta use a door, woman? Tsh."" He shakes his head, long hair still wet against his shoulders. ""Give me five minutes. God extra Mickey D's, if you're hungry."" Extra? Seems like he bought enough for feed a small army of ethopian children.


Hasrah's obviously practiced at climbing through windows, even in this form. Folding her wings tightly against her back, she climbs through, offering him a cheeky grin. ""Didn't know what people would think, seein' me wander through the halls. Guess they should be immune by now, with you walking back and forth."" Her feet land against the carpet with a heavy THUNK, wings unfurling as she stretches cramped muscles.

""I owe you a shirt."" Mmm. McDonalds. One bag is opened quickly, and by the time she turns back again, she's licking salt off of her fingers, the last bit of a french fry disappearing between her lips. ""Give you five minutes for what?"" is asked, followed by a teasing glance. He does fill those shorts, well.. completely. ""I think that's a pretty good look for you, right there.""


""The little ol' Spanish cleanin' lady yelled at me,"" Hellboy admits with a rueful grin, before he vanishes into the bathroom, the door left open. He drys his hair, brushes it out, and then ties it back into the clubknot that hugs the base of his skull. ""And don't think anything of the shirt. You know -- I used to run around in shirtless all the time, on the job. Lost too many clothes, see. Shirts? Who needed 'em. Pants... sort of a nessecity."" Decency and just plain peace of mind, after all. But he does in fact, despite what he just said, get a shirt -- black, with the charcoal gray emblazon of the fist and sword of the BPRD -- and put it on. ""So, what did you do today?"" he asks, as if this were as casual as could be.


By the time he's done dressing, Hasrah is leaning up against the wall, a McDonald's bag in her hand. Still nibbling on french fries, she'd watched him get dressed the entire time, her eyes now and again gleaming with mischief. ""Oh, the usual,"" she purrs, eyes pausing as he pulls the shirt over his head. Mmm.. damn. Shame to cover up that much sk.. c'mon, Haz. Keep up with the conversation.

""Scared small children, caused a few instant conversions, buzzed a couple of churches, and bought myself a new outfit."" With that she straights, taking a step off the wall. The bag is crumpled in her hands and tossed to the table as she poses, wings flared, and her body arched to allow him the max possible view of her.. in all of her glory. ""Like it?""


...

It takes a moment, and there is poor Hellboy, slightly ... stunned. Well. Uh. Yeah. Okay, the teeth of her smile scare the bejeezus outta him, but -- mmm. That? That's. Just. Yeah. He's a man -- he can't help the sudden rush of blood. But -- he just blinks a moment, and then grins, half-smirks. ""IT suits you -- and likely gave quite a few people heart attacks, I bet."" 

Hellboy, the one gentleman left among demon kind. Not a single comment, stare, or rude remark. Or, alas, a compliment, either. He's -- just gonna keep his eyes on her face now. Even if he's suddenly thinking about how scary those damn teeth are.


Oh now.. that can't be allowed, can it? Hasrah is, after all, a girl who thrives on compliments. Who lives to fulfill the fantasies of men.. and perhaps, occasionally, demons. Or demons who claim to be men. Her lips curl into a smile that's straight out of hell. You can't blame him for being scared of that. It's fantasy and nightmare rolled into the seductive curl of lip, brushed with fang. Taking a step towards him, she holds out one hand. ""A few. You're still standing, though.. so I'm not sure it's entirely a success.""


""Hey, you shouldn't try and kill your host,"" Hellboy admonishes, putting up his hands to fend off her advances. He's just going to get his coke and one of the bags of sandwiches, settling down at the end of the bed. He's Zen. He is calm. He is not staring at her tits. No way. He's just... calm. Did we mention Zen? He's Zen. One with nothing and everything. Like his food. Big macs are gone in two winks. ""Besides, what part of 'haven't had a date since '81' did you miss? I'm not exactly ... you know, hot material here."" ... ""Figuratively speaking."" He's plenty hot -- temperature wise.


""I suppose not,"" Hasrah says, leaning over to pick up another bag of hamburgers. When she walks over to him, it's with a sway in her hips that's damned near hypnotic, that tail of hers lazily uncurling in the air behind her.

""I mean, it's not like I don't already have the bed.. and access to your closet. So making you drop wouldn't benefit me much."" And yes, she's dropping into a crouch in front of him, nudging his knees so she can slip in between them, all the while offering him another Big Mac. Just being polite. Sharing food. Yes.

""And I wouldn't say you aren't hot. Just.. a bit repressed. Tsk.""


Hellboy's own tail is a curly-q of tension, piggy-style behind him. He's gonna pop a bone that way, or something. Still, he is calm. ZEN AND CALM GODDAMN IT. But he takes up the sandwich and just arches a brow. ""Aren't you presuming,"" he says, as he unwraps it, careful not to get crumbs in his lap for fear she'll attempt to... do something about him. ""I'm not repressed. Merely... not interested. Lots of confilcts. Work. Me. Humans."" He shrugs; he certainly, does not share why it's been twenty three years since he was with a woman, or why he left her. It's just better not to go there; she might ...take it the wrong way...


""Pfft."" Hasrah tosses his words away with a careless flick of her hand. ""Presuming? I'm -always- presuming. I've found out that if you -don't-, everyone sits around waiting for the other person to say something first."" Tilting her face up at him, one eyelid drooping into a sly wink, before she laughs. Both arms lean against his legs, her hands bridging to provide a perch for her chin. ""Me, I prefer to just cut to the chase. Say what's on my mind.. and get it out of the way.""


""I like direct,"" Hellboy agrees, ""But you're barkin' up the wrong tree, darlin'. I'm not interested. You're an attractive woman -- I do got eyes -- but youa re also an attractive woman who I have agreed t' help out in a difficult situation. To look at you any other way then 'someone who needs my help' would be compromising my professional values and my personal morality."" 

Big Mac #3 is gone, before he even said that. The guy eats like mad. But he taps her nose with one stone finger. ""Besides, you can do better then an ol' stodge like me."" Even if half the reasons he EVER used to avoid attatchments after Stacy... well, they're moot. Completely moot with this woman... unless she choses, one day, not to dance the razor's gleaming edge... and chose a side. And what if that side is human? ...Then she's definitely out. If it's demon? ...She'd be gettin' a date with the Samaritan, that's all...


It cuts, and Hasrah, good as she is, isn't quite good enough to hide that it cuts. She doesn't recoil from him, but her body stills, her tail curling around one leg as she sits and looks up at him for a long moment. And then she laughs, but there's no humor in the sound this time, no wicked teasing. It's long, and it's low, and it's bitter.

""You always make excuses like that?"" she asks quietly, the muscles in her arms flexing as she draws her legs up under her, using his legs to balance herself. Slowly, she's standing.. and she doesn't particularly care that that puts his nose damned near in her navel. ""Like I said.. I prefer direct. You don't wanna touch someone like me.. I can deal with that. Just. Fucking. Say. It.""


""Honey, I don't touch /anybody/. Too complicated, too messy, to much heartache in the end."" He watches her with dark orange eyes, tail twitching behind him. Want to? Sure, what man /wouldn't/, with her oozing pheromones attuned to his particular branch of the phyllum? Yeah, he wouldn't mind. Some primal part of him says he'd /really/ like someone he wasn't holding back with, someone he wasn't scared he was gonna hurt. ""But you're getting confused -- it's not about you. That has always been about /me/. I just -- haven't been with anyone with Stacy. Left it ... questioning too many things. And I really, really loved Stacy. And -- that's part of it too. I don't do casual. I do love."" He smirks slightly. ""Or are you gonna tell me I'm a fool for indulging in that, too?"" 

He pauses. He wonders if he should bring up that man -- the one she wanted, the brightness she wanted to touch. But he doesn't. He keeps it behind his lips, letting the question express itself through only his gaze. You already sniffin' for a new playmate, even after you nearly broke the other, sister? Tsk, tsk, indeed.


Love. It's a foreign concept to Hasrah, who can't remember a time when anyone touched her out of love. Lust, certainly. Misplaced friendship.. yes. Anger and hatred.. oh yes. Touching, for her, has never been about love. It's always been a dance of pain and pleasure. Puzzled eyes look down into Hellboy's face for as long as she can stand it, before she takes a step away, bending down until she's almost chin to chin with him.

One hand reaches to touch his cheek, and this time there's no sexual teasing behind it. She's simply curious, fingers trailing over his skin. ""Love?"" Her voice carries almost all of her questions, and her confusion. ""No.. I won't tell you you're a fool. I just won't pretend to understand why that means anything.""


Those talons -- that once threatened to reduce him to soprano -- are not shied away from. Hellboy endures the curiosity from a fellow 'freak' with aplomb; he just answers her, jaw working under her hand even as she traces the muscles there. ""One day, you might. I hope so. It's a good thing. I -- regret walking away from it,"" he answers her honestly.

His skin is thick and rough, and he's got stubble where he's shaved -- and strangely enough, he smells like peanuts. Dry roasted peanuts. It's a natural thing -- beneath the soap, there's ...warm scent of peanuts. Who knew?


Ducking her head, Hasrah brushes her nose along his jaw, inhaling the scent of him. Peanuts. That's a first.. but it's far and away an improvement over rum, or too much aftershave. The smooth curve of her cheek presses against his. She's shameless, touching him, but at the same time her touches.. these touches.. have an odd sort of primal innocence to them. Hasrah has never been among her own kind without pain, without denial and fear.

One taloned hand ends up on his shoulder as she lets the turn of her head bring her lips near his ear. ""Why did you?"" she asks. He can't know what all of this means to her, the touching, the asking of questions without fear that she'll end up knocked through a wall for her temerity, or worse. He can't know, or so she tells herself. Pity and patience, even from someone like Hellboy.. they would burn.


""It was destroying her life,"" he says slowly, speaking of it for the first time. ""I met her on the job -- she was an archaelologist. They encountered a cult on their last dig. I went up, I killed things, I saved her life. She was grateful, and interested... and I found her intelligent, beautiful, and intriguing. She invites me to the next dig. I go. Not long before we're loved. Three good years."" He smirks then, trying to ignore the pounding in his veins, reminding him that it was three years that haven't been remembered in /twenty three/ years...

""But, I was ... special. Well known. She stopped getting fundin. Grants amazingly dried up. She couldn't get any work -- invitiations to speak stopped coming. Little by little, they were looking at her, and telling her without saying so, 'You're sleeping with a monster.' And... I thought we could hold it together. But at the first year, they stopped just looking at us and the started saying it to our faces. I couldn't deal with it anymore. I was destroying her life, and I was ...questioning myself for the first time. I'd... taken everything for granted up to that point. They'd declared me human, I was a government agent, I fought bad guys and the president shook my damn hand.""

He sighs softly, his eyes closing once, and then opening. ""And I told her so, packed my bags, and went back to the bureau. My father was happy; he hated her. Blamed her for everything."" He smirks slightly. ""But he... he was never with a woman. He was married to his work and he only made time for me.""


Hasrah listens to all of this quietly, gradually settling against him, with her head in the crook of one of his massive shoulders, and her hand curled about the other. Tucked in between his legs, against him, the last thing she ought to be feeling is.. sympathy. Many have used her body for comfort, but Hasrah has never, herself, felt the urge to comfort. She's uncomfortable with the strange feeling curling through her, uncertain how to handle it, or express it.

In the end, she settles for the most familiar response, though it's intended in a way she's never meant before. Squirming against him, she pushes up onto her feet, sidestepping his legs. Tucking her tail out of the way, she sits down on one of his knees, her arms around his shoulders, eyes solemn as she looks at Hellboy, searching for words. ""I.. I am sorry.""


It's strange--to have a lapfull of woman, and know in a way, he's tamed... just a little bit of her. Just a little. Maybe not beyond today, but -- he did make her feel a human emotion even while he's heady with demon blood in her veins. ""I admit, that was the first time I let someone else tell me who I was and what I deserved. I... we had a chance, once, too get back together. But -- it's -- I couldn't."" He shrugs slightly; his left hand finds the small of her back, just above those sinfully low pants. It's a small gesture, a comfort; Hellboy just isn't the touchy sort, even if Hasrah certainly is.

""See why I'm nuts about choice -- and freedom to make it? I threw away something good, because other people decided what I was worth, without even knowing me. In the end, I had to realize my choices is what made me a man or a monster, not what they thought of me."" He smirks, and then glances at her, his orange eyes almost... mirthful. ""'sides, did mean the rest -- my work is dangerous, and after that, I thought better of involvement. Now? Feh, I do construction and metahumans are everywhere. That normal house with a white picket fence and a dog,"" but no two-point-five kids, ""seem more possible. But I'm still.. not sure about some of these things, ya' know? And... Love is still a required component.""


""I.. do not think.. I have ever loved anyone."" It's a harder admission than Hasrah would have thought. She finds odd comfort in the touch of his hand against her back. Leaning down against, she rests her cheek against the top of his head. Yes, she's a touchie-feelie type. She can't help it. She craves contact the way some people crave sweets.. and doesn't allow it very often.

Hasrah closes her eyes, her arms tightening around Hellboy's shoulders as she leans into him. For once, she is utterly unaware of the effect she can have on a man, even one like this one. ""My father did not exactly encourage love. He.. claimed it a human weakness. One that would make me falter towards human, and fall.""


""Your father doesn't know dick,"" Hellboy says with the air of someone who WOULD know -- really, he does! ""But maybe it does work differently for you and I. I can't say; I'm one of a kind, I think."" And who knows with magical creatures? Some violate their own laws on a regular basis! Some... don't. WHo knows? But he tilts his head, allowing the contact, hoping in the back of her mind that his horn stumps don't bother her. They're gettin' a little rough without a regular filing. ""But I think you can do it. You can be what you want to be. If that's both, it'll be hard -- but it's up to you, if you think it's worth it."""

"event","Hellboy walks Hasrah through the first steps of accepting that not everything someone tells her may be true -- himself included -- but that she does have choices in life.

<lj-cut text=""I want to be -me-."">

Hasrah doesn't move immediately. It takes her time to shake off the effects of hearing that name. When she does straighten, she stares after him, her arms wrapping around her, shivering uncontrollably. ""They said that if I chose my soul, I'd be human. I'd lose.. everything. My wings, my powers.. I'd grow -old-. I'd die. If I choose.. the other.. I'll be even stronger, more powerful. I'd never die.. but I'd be damned forever."" She's shaking worse, now, tears welling in her eyes, and rolling down her cheeks. ""I've fought it all my life, to stay in the middle. Always pulling and tugging one way or another. Choose! Be this, be that! I want to be -me-. ""

Regret stabs at him; he grunts once, and then he's over, a kerchief out of a beltpouch, up to wipe away tears. ""Then be you. But know that balance is a razor's edge -- if you say you don't want human friendship because the demon is going to eventually win, then you're already giving in to one side, already tipping the scales. If you don't care about the power, then -- you know what? Grow old. Give up your wings. What is it worth to you? Peace and happiness? Or will you regret it?"" 

He's gentle, though his anger simmers, deep and dark, in his chest. Anger at himself for getting so furious, anger at the men who've told her this. Whoever they are, he wants to pound them till they're mulch. But now, he's just --- Hellboy, worried and gentle. ""But don't let them tell you what you can pick and why you can pick it."" He laughs then, again, bitter. ""They won't even let me do that, you know. Pick and choose. They tried to choose for me. Made that.. change impossible, I guess. But ... if the dreams are right, my mother's human -- even if she was damned. I wish... it was that simple. I'd toss the strength, the years of adventure... just to be able to settle down, get married, have kids, and live quietly.""

Her cheeks are slick beneath his fingers, damp with the tears that continue to well up in her eyes. Her glasses have fogged up to the point of being absolutely useless.. one hand reaches up, her fingers shaking as she pulls them off. Tilting her face up into his hands, she watches his face, searching it for some sense of truth or deception. ""I'm scared.."" is repeated again in a small voice, shamed and confused. ""I.. don't want to die. I don't want to be damned. I don't.. want to be alone always. I'm so tired of being alone. But.. I'm afraid of what I could do. Of what I -want- to do, sometimes.""

Having that flat, craggy face -- all thick jaw and heavy -- it can be hard for him to be read; but he seems sincere, at least, in the passion with which he speaks, the tenderness with which he handles her jaw. ""I know it can be hard,"" he says softly, thanking his God silently for Trevor Bruttenholm, who loved him and raised him with respect and affection, for all the men and women who came into his life and allowed him to grow up strong and self-respecting, trying to forget about those who feared and hated him for what he might be. ""But nothing that is worth having isn't worth some tears and some sweat."" He laughs softly. ""Sometimes, I'm scared. Sometimes, I wonder if they might find a way to take what I have from me. But I fight anyway, because to do otherwise would be to give in, and I don't want to fail myself or those I love. So, I fight -- I beat on things that look a lot like me and I don't ever think about what that might mean, you know? I let them have the demon. Everyone else gets the man.""

Hasrah laughs then, quietly, pressing her cheek against his hand and trying not to think about how desperate her laughter sounds. ""Sometimes I wish I could.. split into two people. The demon and the human. Let them both out, and I'd dissolve somewhere in the middle."" She's quiet for a long moment, continuing to watch him, her expression still puzzled.. but slowly the doubt is going out of her eyes. ""I.. never thought there was a choice."" She can remember her own father's words, all of the times that he came to see her. Choose her heritage, take up her birthright, or lose it all. No-one could balance forever, he said. Those who tried went mad, and ended up losing in the end anyway. There was nothing in the human within her worth keeping. But she'd known that was a lie, even then. She'd summed it up, when she'd described Kurt. They burn, so very brightly..

Quietly, the words push up, out of her throat, falling into stunned silence. Of all the things she'd thought to say, she would never have believed that.. ""Will you help me?""

""Yes."" Without reservation or hesitation, it's there. ""In any way I can, it's yours. I don't have a lot to offer here -- hell, I just got kicked outta my house..."" He laughs softly, sadly now; he misses Magda and Ed and their cats and their crazy little home... but she wanted him gone, and he can't blame her. But he gives his promise, his inviolable word, easily. ""I will do whatever I can for you, Hasrah, to help you through this.""

She's still scared. Hell, she's terrified. She's spent the last several years traveling down one damned hard road. Sure, it was exhausting, and it was lonely.. but it was also familiar. This.. is something completely new for her. She's not used to asking for help, and she's not used to trusting those that offer it. Slowly, her fingers curl around his hand; she presses her cheek against it one final time, and then tilts her head back. Still holding onto his hand, part of her marveling faintly at the oddness of the gesture, and the feel of his palm against hers, she rises to her feet. ""Thank you,"" is said quietly, in oddly formal tones. Demons don't give thanks often. ""I.. will try very hard to make sure you don't regret it."" They don't give their word lightly either, but she says this with no more hesitation than he gave his.

Hellboy allows the contact, not daring to break it -- she needs it to anchor herself, so he lets her. Not the first time, will hardly be the last. But he smiles, the expression a little silly on his blocky face. ""I try to never regret doin' the right thing, Hasrah. So don't you worry about that. Still, you're strung out -- and you're not sober. You really ought to rest here. Think you can try and get some sleep? We can talk this over more tomorrow mornin'."" He tilts his head. ""You work somewhere, Hasrah?""

""I.."" Hasrah stops, torn between pride and shame. ""I..don't have a normal job,"" she finally says quietly. ""So I don't have anyplace I -have- to show up at tomorrow."" Eventually she'll become aware that she's -holding his hand- and drop it like a scalded cat. Drunk and strung out. How in the hell had she allowed herself to come to this, on the floor, crying in front of a virtual stranger. ""Sleep.. would be good.""

Hellboy nods. ""Then I'll let you sleep as late as you want."" He points at the bed, and then goes back to his coffee, once he's freed, not at all embarrassed by her clinging. Been a long time since he had a beautiful woman cling to him. But he takes down the last of his cooled coffee without grimace, and then says, ""We'll get breakfast,"" Or lunch, ""And talk things over some more. You can take the bed -- I'm fine with the floor. Just toss a pillow and one of the comforters down, and I'll be just fine.""

Ordinarily Hasrah would laugh at the idea, but she's still more than a little stunned by everything that's happened over the last 24 hours. Numbly, she walks over to the bed, sliding beneath the covers without protest, though as she lays her head down she turns for just a moment to look at him. ""You don't have to sleep on the floor. I don't want to kick you out of your bed. And I don't think either of us are up for anything more than sleep. Do what you want."" The words are barely out, though, and then she's out.. her eyes closing and her body relaxing beneath the blankets.

Uh. Whoa. Color Hellboy a little shocked. But he recovers well enough, and coughs. ""Hasrah, I haven't been with a woman since '81. Sex is one of those things that rarely ever crosses my mind anymore. But I was raised a gentleman, and a gentleman gives up his bed for a lady."" He takes a pillow and a blanket, and the floor as well. He crosses over to the single lamp in the room, and says, ""Sleep well. You're safe here, all right?"" 

Then, it's dark; there's the rustle of cloth; clothing hits the floor, and then so does Hellboy; he is quiet, though it takes time for sleep to come to him."

"event","Hellboy wants a beer. Trevor want violence. Hasrah just wants.

<lj-cut text=""This a private party?"">

The city is a very, very interesting place once the sun has gone down. Particularly on the weekend nights, when people are yet to need to go to work, and are hunting various sorts of fun and entertainment. And thus, it's after midnight, on a Sunday evening, and at least one of the city's 'seedier' inhabitants is already hunting down said fun and games.

I love this place. So many places for people to be able to go unnoticed, what with the chaotic mix of residential and commercial, and let's not forget the low-rent housing that attracts all the worst kinds of scum. Not that all the people Trevor shakes down are that kind of scum, of course, but this one is. A young man who'd been rather cheerfully spraypainting a mixture of anti-meta messages and some gang-like tags. And, well, Trevor got curious to hear just what those tags might mean. You know. Friendly curiosity. Just some random bits of 'I wonder'. Stuff like that.

""Now."" That voice would be Trevor. He's standing along one of the darker alleyways, attention wholly on the guy he's got slammed up against the wall. It could be an almost ridiculous sight... Trevor at 5'6"" and the jerk at 6' or better, with Trevor actually having to glare _up_ at the guy to snarl... except for the fact that the guy's being held off his feet not by his collar, but by something that looks rather like a pitch-black wing, arched around Trevor's back and pushing the guy fiercely into the wall. There's already a thin, reedy rattle in the 'artist's' throat where his breathing's been cut off somewhat, and a line of red from the corner of his mouth where a few teeth have already been knocked out. His right arm is hanging unnaturally crooked, and there's a rough street-pistol on the ground underneath him where he apparently dropped it. Oh, and did I mention the guy looks like he probably needs to change his shorts? "".... let me try asking this again. Before I break your other arm. _What_ group are you dealing with presently, hmmmm? I'm perfectly reasonable, you know. I mean, if you just let me know, we won't have to dance this dance again, and everyone can go home happy."" Pause. ""Well, as happy as you _can_ go home, considering I'm not sure how well you'll be walking by the time I'm done with you."" He sounds far, _far_ too amused.

Stepping out of a taxi and up onto the sidewalk, Hasrah runs her fingers through her hair, touseling the curls that are falling down over her shoulders. One slim finger pushes her glasses back up on her nose, a sardonic smile curling her lips. Oh yes. Another day, another dollar. The joy of the scam.

Turning towards the bar, she walks a few feet and hesitates, her head lifting as though to sniff at the air. Both shoulders roll back, suddenly flexing, and her eyes widen. Two, so close to each other? Turning quickly, she starts back for the road, one hand lifting to slow the taxi when an arm slides around her waist. ""Hey baby, you sure you don't want to come into the bar? Place is dead.. needs a pretty thing like you to liven it up."" Turning, Hasrah stares finds herself looking down into the face of a short, balding pudgy little man, and blinks incredulously at him.. for the moment to surprised to move.

All. He. Wanted. Was. An. Effin'. BEER. That's all. So much to ask? A nice night at Annie's --since she actually likes that he's a nice guy, a big guy, and a responsible guy. To the point where he's just about got bouncing rights at Crescent Moon for his 'clean up' of various events better left unmentioned *coughkoudelkacough*. But trouble comes to him like it does in flocks, and when someone comes in nervously to the bar and mentions that SOMEONE might wanna call the cops -- there's meta-trouble -- well. Shit. So much for a peaceful beer.
Gun hidden in the folds of his coat, Hellboy opens the doors to Crescent Moon like an avenging angel -- only not quite so holy. Clomping hooves find the concrete, and he doesn't even NOTE Hasrah -- he's all eyes for trouble -- sort of looking forward to something he can handle solely with a growl, maybe even his good left hook. He never even thinks that he might need Samaritan. At least, he hopes he doesn't have to think about using Samaritan...

Striding past Hasrah and her 'date', he steps off the curb, crossing the street, his cigar's cherry a bright point of red between his lips. ""Listen,"" he says shortly, not even asking business or worry, ""You got exactly ten seconds to stop with the threats, drop the punk, and pray to whatever god you might believe in. Cause I've already had a bad damn weekend, and you are NOT making it any better."" Orange eyes are as bright as the cigar's light -- all three gleam in unholy unison. C'mon, Trevor. Try it. Try it so Unca Hellboy can take you out to the woodshed for some schoolin'.

What is it with heroes and their effin' bad timing? ""Listen. This doesn't concern-..."" Well. Trevor stopped _that_ comment pretty quickly when he turned his head to regard Hellboy, and gets a look at just _who_ he's talking to. Or rather, _what_. ""Or,"" he adds, ""on second thought, maybe it does concern you. Now. I'm a reasonable person."" HAH! HA HA HA-... ahem. ""I'm doing my civic duty here, cleaning up a little bit. This guy would sooner shoot you than look at you, so why don't you-""

""The FUCK are you? God DAMN! Get this freak off me! He's gonna kill-...""

*FWAP* Without even looking at the guy, a slip of shadow whips its way out of the wing and slaps across the guy's mouth, muffling it underneath the Darkforce. "".... just keep going and let me handle this."" Trevor finishes, with barely a pause to do the silencing. And Hasrah? Hasrah who? She's nice and peaceful over there. Far as Trevor's concerned, she doesn't matter right now.

Moment over. Hasrah is a practical gal, but there are some lines even a practical gal won't cross.. and pudgy, balding short men cross damned near every one of them. Tugging away from that arm is an easy task with the horny little toad still staring after Hellboy. ""Go home and change your shorts, little man."" Hasrah doesn't even pause to look at him, sweeping past as though her weren't there. Infernal curiousity.. it would get her ass back in the pit one of these days if she weren't careful. Still.. that one is enough to make even the pits worth a second look.

Just a few seconds behind Hellboy, Hasrah rounds the corner, just in time to hear the mortal's protest, and watch the casual way he is slapped to silence. Dark eyes narrow, and she takes a step back, into the shadows. This is NOT your fight, girl. Let them battle for the fool's soul, if that's what they're after. Just stay, and watch. Perhaps you'll learn some.. ""Ahem."" Clearing her throat quietly, she steps out of the shadows, offering them both a sardonic smile. ""Is this a private party, or can anyone join into the fun."" You bloody fucking IDIOT.

The right hand is lifted, as Hellboy realizes that this guy isn't gonna do what he asks with the growl, so he begins to move, quietly, to the side, his tail lashing a violent serpentine behind him. It should be noted that stone knuckles don't POP -- they grate, flexible and jointed in a way that stone just SHOULD NOT BE. ""You have two choices,"" Hellboy says calmly, right hand still up. ""You let him go, or I begin to pound you. And I don't know about how hard you hit, but I know I hit... damn hard.""

A quick pop -- back and forth, with a speed that belies the man's massive side, and there is now a nice, three-knuckle imprint now two inches into the brick. ""I'm going to have to hit /you/ next. And son, I'm bettin' that just like shit, you /splatter/.""

But then he pauses -- what was that? ""Shit, this is not a party. This is a man. I don't -- ah, /fuck all/."" The way he says it, it's like he's reached his temper's edge; he rarely uses language so strong, and it seems to roll off his tongue with the awkwardness that says 'I'm a boyscout when I'm not a raging torrent of anger and hate'. ""Go home. You. Drop him. I'm not telling you again -- least, not with my mouth.""

The crack of stone on brick earns a brief flinch from Trevor. Loud, that. And not all that far away, either. The look isn't accompanied by any sort of sheepish putting down, or mad fleeing, though. Just a fluid bleed of shadow down from the wing, as though the projections of 'feather' are melting down and onto him, running a black cloaking over the rest of his body. ""You want to talk about shit? Then you should consider this piece of it right here."" One hand, now covered in dark, gestures up toward the man (who is still being held). ""You're bugging the wrong side, here, Big Man.""

But like Hellboy, the comment catches Trevor's attention. And eyes flicker toward where the woman's approach is. Dear gods. What is it, Tall People Night? He hates that. ""I suppose that depends,"" is his answer to her, somewhat flatly. ""Which part do you consider 'fun'?"" Oh gods. It's not going to end up being two on one here, is it? Trevor's not stupid; while he believes he can probably handle Hellboy (Ok, so maybe he _is_ stupid), he's not dumb enough to think he can deal with two directly after him. ... of course, it depends on just what the big woman's bringing to the party, as she puts it.

""I'd like to,"" Hasrah retorts, ducking to one side of Hellboy and trying to step around him. ""But I've got a quota to meet, and this little fight of yours, it's going to put a damper on business."" Well.. maybe not. Few things go together like sex and violence. Haz can't quit resist smiling at that thought, her eyes lighting up wickedly. Tilting her head up, she offers that smile to Trevor, glancing at the boy he's holding up, eyes pausing on the darkforce ""wing"" with naked curiosity. ""Oh, I'm easy, babe.. and fun is -such- a broad category. Whatcha got to offer?""

Hellboy glances to the tags -- they're not that hard to make out. But he shrugs, and grunts, ""Hate to say, but every man is entitled to his opinion -- alas, as a former U.S. Agent, I've gotta uphold that right. Even if it does make me want to punch out his teeth. You, on the other hand, are actively /asking/ me to punch out your teeth by giving folks like me -- who don't do shit that makes folks like him reactionary shitheads. So, honestly, you're higher on my shit list. Sorry, kid.""

But then he looks a Hasrah, and frowns. ""If you start pulling bizarre powers out of your slinky little dress, lady, you'll find I'll hit you too, and your pretty face may not recover so well. So, please. Take your quota where I can't catch you and have to hit you, mmmkay?"" He chews the tip of his cigar with irritation; dark-shadow-boy here, unknown quantity in the woman. Goddamn it. Not his night. So going to have to break the gun out. He just knows it.

Trevor rolls his eyes up to the heavens. It's going to be one of those nights, isn't it? Raven is _so_ going to kill him. Well, at least he can hopefully keep damage down _somewhat_; he can always come back to the guy later. The shadow holding the man's mouth wraps just a little tighter, effortlessly jerking forward, then back, without Trevor doing more than half-glancing at the man against the wall. There's a sickening *CRACK* as the guy's head hits the wall. His eyes glaze and he slumps. Unconscious. Or maybe dead. Trevor's not bothering to check, really. He just wanted the guy to stay where he was for the moment. ""What I've got to offer could be well worth the play,"" he's answering Hasrah even as he aims to conk out his 'toy'. ""Although I have a feeling that things are a bit busy at the moment...."" And somehow, the typist doesn't think Trevor will get to say much more than that.

Oooh.. a challenge. ""Is that so?"" Hasrah turns towards Hellboy, a carefully arranged pout parting her lips. ""Big guy like you.. you wouldn't hit a /girl/, would you?"" One small hand reaches out, as if to push Hellboy back.. or maybe she just wants to cop a feel. Looking at him, who wouldn't? In the same motion, she's turning back to Trevor, just as the boy he's holding has his little ""accident."" 

Not your fight, Haz.. dammit, what's the use of having an inner voice if you never listen to it? Hasrah's hand stops short of touching Hellboy, her attention shifting wholly to Trevor. Distraction, first. ""Have to admit,"" she purrs, arching her shoulders back slightly, the tip of her tongue flicking over full lips. ""You -do- look like more fun than Mr. ""U.S. Agent"" over there. What d'ya say? Let him scoop your toy off the sidewalk, and we'll go see what kind of trouble we can scare up?""

Hellboy is hot -- and not just in the figurative, subjective 'I find him sexually arousing' sort of way. He /burns/ under the brush that Hasrah gives him, his skin heated and his eyes ablaze. And it's about that time that he forgets that she's getting in the way -- and just looks at her-- only to miss that Trevor just did something very, very bad.

This is about the time that Trevor's gonna get mobbed by a seven foot, four hundred pound red gorilla who really needs a dose of anger management. He doesn't bother with coherent roars, growl building up to a roar, as he moves to get ahold of Trevor and attempt to PITCH him bodily into trash cans. His left hand; small and practically DELICATE compared to his right, comes up to attempt to get Hasrah out of the way first -- hand to mid-chest, no less (no coping a feel for Hellboy; even in combat, he draws the line somewhere) and attempts to get Trevor in the other hand so he can just -- heavy him over Hellboy's own head and throw him into the dumpster back there.

And who said Hasrah wouldn't have fun with Hellboy; she'll be next if she keeps edging at him like that!

Trevor had sort of been expecting something like that, to be honest. Enough that he'd gotten the shadow up, to be able to brace himself against the physical attack. And picking Trevor up.... well, he feels about like he looks: 5'6"" of Just About Nothing. The hand's going to come in contact with something that's not quite solid, but damned well not anything else, as it grabs Trevor's front. Reactions are quick: as soon as Trevor feels himself being hurled, his wings snap to give him some stabilization, turning the throw into a power-glide, so he can at least keep from going headfirst into something hard. There's still a rather loud *CLATTER* of trash cans as he lands, though, dropping into a controlled roll rather than a sprawl. And if there'd needed to be proof that the wings Aren't Quite Normal, that throw would likely do it, since they don't seem to actually touch anything, so much as wisp and pass through and around them.

Even controlled, the roll and impact isn't much fun. Thank gods for shadow-armor. ""Now, that wasn't very neighborly"" grunts Trevor when he finally stops it, eyes narrowed at Hellboy... for the matter of moments before the shadow comes up and obscures his features completely. ""I'm trying to clean up the city, and you're trying to stop me. You know, I've not had a good week, myself; don't piss me off.""

Hellboy's gentle shove knocks Hasrah back a few feet, safely out of the way for his attack on Trevor. Safely being just far enough that her heel catches on a discarded can of spray paint, sending her backwards against the wall. Sliding to the ground, she sits there for a moment, shaking her head to clear it. She can hear the clatter of trash cans, and Trevor's speech comes through loud and clear. This has escalated from a confrontation to a brawl. Any intelligent half-demon gal would be getting her pretty little ass back to the bar where it's safe.

Hasrah is.. sitting right where she is. Mostly because the change -hurts-. It always hurts. Every time she does it she's convinced that this time it'll be okay. She's done it often enough that she'll be ready for the pain. Each time it happens, she finds out just how wrong she is. Joints twist and pop as they surge within, changing shape and size. Bones writhe beneath her skin, muscle reforming itself. Kicking off her shoes before her talons can burst through them, she pushes herself to her feet, wings breaking free from the skin of her back. Her clothes are shredded by the change, leaving her dressed in little more than a tube top and what remains of her skirt. It's enough to cover her decently, but barely. If anything about a half-incubi could be considered decent.

""Oh, yeah. Clean up -- so bright. A meta murders an anti-meta -- even the lowest of the low -- and it backlashes. Shit, kid, I have fought my way to my rights for sixty years, the hard way! I never killed anybody, I never beat up anybody -- I slogged it out through judges and congress and making small, polite statements to the goddamn president. You don't get anywhere just beatin' the shit out of people just because they'rey stupid.""

Hellboy stops here. He blinks; he turns, something licking at the back of his neck, something just /saying/ 'turn around'. And there's Trevor's opening, because -- wow. Uh. Shit. ""Goddamn it,"" is about all Hellboy can say about the absolutely indecent half-demoness. She just made his night that much more complicated. ""You couldn't just go home, could you?"" he says, even as his left hand fishes into a pocket -- it comes out with a necklace that is quickly slung around his neck -- it's a simple murmur and the ward is activated -- giving him a good ten feet that becomes repellent to any demons -- with the exception of the Demon with the Soul of a Man, yadda yadda, Hellboy himself. ""You stay put. I'll deal with you in a minute. Now... You, shadowboy... You're gonna sit tight, and I'm gonna call the cops, and we're not going to have anymore fun tonight, mmmkay? I thought you'd agree."" He backs up two steps -- hoping his wardstone keeps Hasrah at bay, and slowly begins to kneel down to check the man down there; one he could handle. Two gets messy. Two and a dead guy? This is just asking to end up with him calilng Magda for bail or something equally miserable. However, he does sweep his jacket back; the Samaritan is plainly shown, as a warning.

The guy's just unconscious. Probably won't have much of a happy day tomorrow, but he's still breathing. The arm's broken pretty messily, though; it looks as though something with more strength than a human should have handled it by grabbing and twisting. Someone's going to need a few weeks in hospital... or a very sharp scalpel.

_Fucking_ hell. Guns. Why is it always *GUNS*. Why can't anyone fight nice and playfully any more? The weapon is getting wary attention from the man. Enough attention that he barely even gives a sign that he's noticed Hasrah's changing. Ah, phobias are _so_ good at killing wonder. But wait. Hellboy mentioned police. And police don't sound like a Good Thing whatsoever. They tend to piss Trevor off, even when a handful of cash can usually keep them fairly entertained and busy. So, let's not go there, shall we? ""Well. While you play for sixty years and enjoy yourself, I personally prefer handling things a little more proactively."" he says to Hellboy as a shadow snakes out, aiming to try and get hold of the handle of that gun and yank it out of the holster. Gah. Get that thing away from the demon-boy, before he actually _draws_ it.

It is unfortunate that Hasrah was already within the ten feet that ward should have provided when it became active. Another might have been flung out of it, forced from the circle of protection by the very nature of their being. Hasrah, however, is only half-demon, and the soul she possesses protects her.. if protect is truly the right word. Trapped within the ward's reach, she stumbles, almost falling to her knees as nausea rips through her. ""What.."" she manages that one word before actually faltering down to one knee, her entire body trembling. ""What have you -done-.."" And this, Haz, is why you never get involved. It always backfires.

With the man alive and something racing at him, Hellboy is quick to clamp down on the gun with his right hand -- since it's a right draw, and he is left handed when it comes to shooting -- and glare up at Trevor, trying to grab at that...thing, only to ...catch nothing but air. ""What the hell are you. Sorcerer? Psychic? Or you just smoke so much your cloud of smog get a mind of it's own?"" Hellboy says as he tries to get to his feet without losing his gun again, carefully drawing it one handed and shifting it to his left, taking up a defensive position over the fallen man. ""You know,"" he says, ""Were I the violent, angry type, kid, I'd've blown your brains out at the beginning. And I'm betting the cops get called, you'll just make a mess of them too, won't you?"" He trembles with it, but then tilts the Samaritan up. ""GEt out. Get out of here, and never let me catch you here again, doing shit like this -- or next time, I'll shoot first and consider it garbage day, kid.""

Augh! Trevor himself isn't feeling much more than slightly discomforted, because of the gun and not the pendant, but the energy is rather disapproving of the whole thing. Even under Trevor's control, the bend spasms as though it's in pain, jerking viciously away as it comes too close to the demonic figure. Hellboy's clutch finds nothing but air... or rather, something that's just barely tangible, like grabbing a handful of cobweb. Or maybe more like water, considering the energy is actually slightly cool to the touch and seems to flow, though it is neither wet, nor sticks. _Especially_ not sticks. It's trying to get the hell _out_ of there. ""... the _fuck_...?"" Well, the comment doesn't go any further. Trevor's suddenly got a gun that's being angled his way. Not fun. Beneath the shadow, he can feel his face paling. Thank gods for coverage, though, so it doesn't show. ""Fine. You want him? You can have him. I'll find out from somewhere else."" Warily, the little man takes a couple steps, trying to figure out if there's a way around Hellboy. Without having to get close to that weapon.

Coughing up bile, Hasrah leaves a small pool of something that used to be scotch puddling around Hellboy's feet. No, that wasn't deliberate. Not at all. He just happened to be there. Swinging around the damned ward that was making her sick. She'd cuss, if she could get the words out between stomach-spasms, but unfortunately anything she might say is drowned out in another spatter of stomach acid laced with booze. Trembling, she's on both knees now, her skin covered with sweat, trembling despite the heat her body is starting to throw off.

Hellboy stops, touching the pendant, and he says to Hasrah, ""Sorry -- was just a precaution. Stay put and the nausea will pass, I'm told."" He taps the pendant with his hand, and says a small prayer of thanks in Yiddish, and then... nothing. No more pain, no more suffering. Just a pretty red rock on a cord. He kneels down, despite the guck at his feet, to offer Hasrah his right hand -- the nigh indestructible one, see -- to help her up. He won't be putting down the gun, however, till Trevor's long gone.

Trevor _was_ going to take a little jaunt over there to offer Hasrah his own hand up. But. Man With Gun. That looks decidedly unpleasant. And Trevor's not really feeling like getting into it. Finally deciding that discretion is the better part of valor, he lets the dip of those shadowy wings twist down, partially enfolding him in a black blanket. A blanket that sort of... implodes, the shadow vanishing in a few shreds of darkness, and leaving nothing in its wake. But Trevor's not going all that far just yet. Curiosity dictates he stay around enough to see just how that little handshake is going to go. So seconds later, an alleyway darkens, dropping Trevor back out into the Real World. Far enough from the action that he's not having to warily eye the gun. Close enough that he's pretty sure he'll be able to get there physically if fun starts up.

It takes another moment for the tremors and the nausea to subside enough for Hasrah to see that hand. Reaching up, she grasps it and starts to use it to pull herself up, only to stop with one hand reaching rather rudely between Hellboy's legs, and her talons clutching in a place most precarious. ""Give me one reason why I shouldn't have you singing like a fucking choirboy?"" she hisses at him, her wings flapping wildly with agitation. ""I was trying to -help- you, you stupid hunk of.."" Her words trail off, into another angry hiss, frustration momentarily robbing her of her ability to speak.

""If you make me sing like a choirboy -- I'm a bass, by the way, and was in the men's church choir back at base -- I can't very well apologize. Still, you really don't know the meaning of 'don't get involved', do you?"" Hellboy says, rueful. But even as she's steady, he's holstering his gun and kneeling down to get the poor schmuck. ""You -- you got a ... shit, can you change back? I'll give you my coat."" For decency's sake. It'll be like a potatoe sack on her, but that's... at least more decent then what's she's got going on right now! ""I just --want to get some calls made and leave this guy to the authorities.""

Trevor isn't aiming to hide, but he's not really making himself known. Just sort of leaning and watching. Yeah. Hasrah can probably sense him still about, but Trevor doesn't know that. See? He's being good! ... or maybe he's just waiting to try and pick up the pieces, worse comes to worse.

Hasrah allows her talons to close, just a bit, around Hellboy's thigh. A reminder of how sharp they are, perhaps. Or perhaps she's simply using him to ..steady.. herself. Yes. that's it. As he kneels, she's standing, and stepping back, unashamed of the state of her clothing, or how she looks. Shame simply isn't a part of her package. ""I have my own clothing at home.."" she tells him with a quiet chuckle. ""And an open window to climb through. Stop by sometime, maybe I'll show you around."" And with that she's beating her wings against the air, raising more than a bit of wind as she prepares to take to the skies and go home. Tonight simply doesn't seem to be a night for playing with the humans.

Opening his mouth, Hellboy is at a loss. What the hell was that. ""I don't even know your name,"" he mutters, looking down to the mushed up human. Bah. Not his night, not his weekend. Not his month. Sigh. He shifts to take up the human in his arms, and heads toward the bar. He'll just ... get him taken care of there... and wonder if he should've let Hasrah pop the twins -- probably would have saved him a whole lot of trouble in the future...

Well, if Hasrah is heading out, why the hell not? Shadowy wings reach as well, and Trevor takes effortlessly to the air. Maybe to talk to her, or maybe just to get the hell out of there. Time will tell, really."

"event","Hellboy and Magda fight. Big.

<lj-cut text=""If that's the way you want it."">

And he's still talking. Magda stops furiously in her tracks, a sharp, pointed breath knifing out of her the moment she hears Hellboy's voice. Talking. Calling after her. Her fingers curl like claws, flexing once before they curl into fists. She can feel her temper flare, a brief but howling note of anger that takes every inch of her to contain. She whirls on him, a disbelieving look carved across her face, her hands opening again to grab handfuls of her dark curls. ""Would you just leave me ALONE?!"" she shouts back at Hellboy, shaking her head like this all isn't happening. It's too insane. ""Just shut up! Why are you doing this? You finish berating me in front of those fuckers in there, and now you're fucking dogging me everywhere!"" She points a finger damningly, barking her order, ""Fuck off!""


""I berated you because it A: - -got me in, and B, because you act like this, and the way you did in the mayor's office. You kept it up, and you would have known /nothing/, Magda. You're a good cop -- but you're a goddamn pitbull parent, you know that?"" Hellboy doesn't sound angry, though, and there he is, still dogging her heels. Not letting up. But at least he keeps his distance. ""And I'm not going to 'fuck off', till I know you're in your right damn mind! So until you're calm and sane, I'm not going /anywhere/.""


The woman begins to turn back, supposedly to ignore him, but like that ever happens. The word 'parent' strikes a painful discord on her ears, and she reacts visibly to the word, a nerve struck like salt rubbed into her wound. Magda has issues like a dog has fleas, and they show especially when she's angry. She faces Hellboy again, a five-foot tornado looking fit to decimate a good replacement for Kansas. ""Shut. The fuck. UP!"" she demands, her voice a little shrieky. ""Stop making your fucking assumptions about me, about who I am, OK? And my mind, whatever FUCKING STATE in CHOOSES, ain't your BUSINESS!""


""I don't have to make assumptions, Magda! Listen to yourself!"" he insists, though he falls back. He''ll let her get a ways forward -- and then just play Shadow. Which is probably just as bad as being right on her heels -- but still. He's not leaving her alone. Not like this, with --with whatever that was going on in her head.

That silences her a moment. Magda stands there. She stares at him. And then the breath hitches out of her like a kick to the gut. ""How dare you,"" she says in an icy voice, her eyes narrowing, her face frozen in disgust. ""Listen to yourself! Fucking talk me down in front of those fucking bastards, after what they did to Ed? You see the blood on him? Fucking potshots! Potshots at fucking kids! And you're too fucking busy exchanging pleasant-fucking-tries to notice! Oh, the weather's so fucking lovely, how's your Aunt Agatha?!"" It's anger talking now, anger and confusion and frustration and desperation and what the fuck WAS THAT? She throws up her hands, gesturing rabidly before she points a finger again, every inch of her now rigid in condemnation. ""Don't you EVER fucking berate me in front of people. I KNOW what I'm doing. How dare you preach fucking sanity at me! I am the only sane fucking PERSON in this city! Sane people get PISSED off when shit hits the fan! I don't fucking sit back and sip fucking tea! So piss off! I don't want to talk. I don't want to look at ANYTHING. Do you hear me?!""


""SAne people get pissed. Sane people do not piss away their opportunities because anger runs their lives. Did I see Ed? No. Yeah, I did. After I spent /two days/ making sure you weren't going to die on me -- days I spent half with you, half scouring the city for him. And when you ere capable of moving, who did I take you to? Not the mayor. Oh no. I took you to /Ed/. So don't you tell me I'm not all about pleasantries or anything else! My aunt goddamn Agatha wasn't /in/ the infinity pit, Madga."" But he rumbles, then, taking a breath and letting it in thunder, the sound echoing in his chest, his temper reigned. ""I know Ed and I know what he's capable of. And he's a kid -- but he's more capable then a lot of grown men I know. He is obviously more then able to take care of himself when it comes to a few men in city hall security. Which is not the point, Magda."" But that's not what's the problem here. ""The problem is you. You cannot /save them all/. And you can't save any of them when you're bleeding hate into the air like a diesel breathes out smog. Don't you get it? You're a great cop -- a really. great. cop. But the moment it becomes personal, the minute you're /involved/, you go right to righteous rage and it kills your ability to /think straight/. You went in there, balls to the wall, and made a demand of a man who could have -- and would have been /justified in/ -- stripping you of your gun and your rank. Do you want that? You live for your work. You named your cat after the goddanm best detective in the world. It's what you do! But you can't do it... if you're running like a train off it's rails, Magda! You'll just run yourself into the ground and then you'll be just spinnin' your damn wheels!""


""This isn't personal!"" she tells him, her voice lowering now, but no less harsh. Magda watches Hellboy angrily, her pointed finger lowering to dangle its hand at her side. She arranges her jacket and angrily at her shoulder holster: a testament to the control of Magda's rage that she hasn't brushed a finger once on her weapon. ""It's right and fucking wrong. It's between being a person or a monster. They shot at a kid. This is my job. This is who I am. I stop that shit. I stop it FLAT on its fucking ass, you hear me? Berate me all you fucking want. I don't care what you think about me. You fucking asses get on my nerves."" She rubs roughly at the back of her neck, letting out a poisonous sneer. ""But I'm not done with this. I am not done with them. They can strip me to the fucking bone. They can try."" The woman turns back again, putting her back on Hellboy, beginning to walk away once more. ""You say I'm fucking insane? I've never seen shit so clearly.""


""I didn't say you were insane, Magda,"" he says. ""I said you were a psychometrist. I also said you're riding too close to the edge. But it's your choice. Just don't expect me to stand by while you jump the rails. 'Cum lux cadit, tenebrae praevalet -- it's not 'protect and serve', but the sentiment is the same, Magda. And I am not gonna fail. Not you, or anybody else."" He jingles the keys, and then a flick of his big, stone fingers send them back to her. ""Get home. I'll meet you there."" He won't deprive her of her truck, now. Just like that, he's turning and heading back the other direction, tail heading back.
tail...whipping side to side.


Hand whipped up like a viper, she snatches her keys, her stormy eyes slowly, reluctantly forcing themselves from Hellboy to look down at the object in her gloved hand. She squints at her car keys, looking back up in time to see him turn away. All she can do is frown, feeling her anger already disengaging, and becoming irritated that she can't even remain furious for as long as she wants. ""I don't expect you to stand by!"" she calls after him, sharp and acidic. ""Never did! Don't expect -- don't /want/ anything!"" With a grunt, she turns herself, and not toward her truck. Magda continues on her path, which is away from here, the only direction she needs right now. ""Everyone just stay the fuck outta my life.""


""That's the way you want it,"" Hellboy rumbles, and continues his inexorable trot away. He can't explain the sudden stab at his chest, or the hurt it leaves. Just --got too involved, he supposes. He's guilty of it too. He just feels bad about the kid, really. He needs something stable, and this just isn't it. But still, she wants him gone, he'll get gone."

"event","Hellboy follows Magda to meet the Mayor. The mayor speaks with them at length about Ed and security and things. And then, Magda kicks Hellboy out for being rational, intelligent, and threatening to sit her. Well, we never said he was tactful...

<lj-cut text=""It really does concern me."">

It's a beautiful day, and as the afternoon draws on, the Mayor becomes slowly convinced that perhaps it will also be disaster-free. His paperwork is looking reasonable, and he stands at the window, looking out at the Circle with a thoughtful expression. In the outer office his PA types busily away; there are security guards stationed strategically around City Hall, just in case someone should try anything.


""I don't need backup. I don't need help here. I am a calm person. I am very rational about this. I'm an officer of the law. It is my job to be very calm and very rational,"" Magda explains as though she's said this the twenty-seventh time this hour. And she is, very calm, very reasonable, a very direct, succinct woman if not for the apocalypse shining in her gunmetal eyes. She is a knife, and she cuts through both doors of City Hall, her eyes sharp and the look on her face something serrated. Immediately stopped by security guards, she comes wielding her badge, her voice as clipped as the glock on her side as she says, ""The Mayor. I want to see him. I need to see him now.""


""You do, you do, you aren't, you aren't, you are, and it is, but you're not."" Hellboy says, heavy hooves adding a noise that City Hall rarely hears -- that of a two-legged Clysdale trotting in behind the diminutive woman, a billowing superhero shadow to her itty bittyness. He glances about -- noting the coffee dispenser and a candy machine, and giving a polite small to the security guards; the easy expression of someone who's had to fill their shoes -- or occasionally empty theirs of them. He's been on both sides. All depending on who's doing what when. ""Sirs,"" is just uttered as she makes her demand, nearly subsonic basso voice low and polite.


The guards are not going to let Magda in with her gun. They're very apologetic about this, but also very firm. If she wants to carry her gun, she can meet the Mayor outside, but nobody gets into the inner office carrying a firearm. They don't seem too perturbed by Hellboy. ""And, uh, no offense, but is there a reason you *both* need to see the Mayor?"" That's Joe; he's fiftyish, lean, with the sharp gaze of someone who's spent a long time doing this kind of work. There's a metal detector in the corridor that leads back towards the offices.


It takes a long moment for Magda parse this, as though the polite and civil officers are speaking in tongues. Her face reveals nothing, not even a frown, just the same, disapproving look of a woman somewhere between hatred, hellfire, and a hangover. Then slowly, calmly, she reaches for her sidearm. She may be more enraged than she's been in years, but she doesn't break rules. She sourly takes off her glock, safety-on, and ejects the clip before offering them both to the guards in her gloved hands. Eyes narrowing at Joe's question, she arches a look over her shoulder -- over and up and up and up at Hellboy -- eyeing her stubborn tenant with thought. ""I'll meet with him alone if it's the way you prefer --"" she says in a roundabout sort of way, already trying to weasel from the back-up she doesn't need. Give her five minutes alone with the man.


""Honestly, sir? I'm gonna sit on my landlady if she gets frothy and overprotective."" Which she will, his rueful expression seems to indicate, also killing any thought of letting Magda go in alone even as she tries to ditch him. Really, the big red guy? He's the sane one. He also had his good sense not to bring his -- unregistered, oh my god that is a gun among guns -- Samaritan with him, so he is happy to express that he is unarmed (except for the ROCK attached to his right arm, really) and means no harm; Hellboy is excellent at conveying he's a peaceful guy, because besides that he's seven feet tall and a quarter ton of muscle, he really /is/ a peaceful guy... Emptying his pockets and leaving his long-coat behind since it would NEVER get through a metal detector, though, that was harder. But it was done. He feels a little naked without it, but... ah well. The Mayor isn't going to cast spells on him, now is he? (He hopes not. Never seem to be able to tell in this city.) ""And what we've come to discuss /does/ concern me, just a little. Sir. I promise, I won't be talking much. Just keeping her from going off her keel."" He smiles then to Magda. See? Now if you make a scene here, you'll confirm everything I've said and it'll look like you really /do/ need me to keep you from going into a total conniption with the mayor. You're stuck.


The arguments are not particularly convincing, and the skeptical expressions of the guards reflect this. ""Sir, I'm sorry,"" Joe says, ""but I think you'll find that -- "" The telephone on the wall rings. Joe answers it, and pales, ever so slightly. There's a short conversation, of which Joe's half mainly consists of 'yes, sir' and then the guard hangs up. He recovers, and turns to face the two. ""The Mayor will see you now. Just down the hall, first door on the right. Janine will let you through.""


It takes a very good eye, perhaps on par of a hawk, to see the way Magda's jaw steels down. The second Hellboy explains himself, explains her state of mind, and argues against her sensibilities in front of security guards -- he's going to be hearing about it when they get home. For now, there's a dusky look framing Magda's sharp face, a caged wolf that stalks back and forth along the steel bars of her grey eyes. Eyes of which that -- turn at the phonecall, the rest of her waiting with the crisp patience of an executioner. Regarding the security guard, the woman says nothing more. She merely turns, passing through the metal detector without a beep, stepping purposefully down the hall. Her hackles are up.


Providence. Hellboy smiles slightly, though his tail twitches with some minor agitation. See you. Both? He supposes so. But he inclines his head a little, and then glances to Magda, watching her lead off and following her like his big red shadow, long tail twitching back and forth. But he shadows behind her, exuding the calm she lacks as much as his size dwarfs hers. Yeah, he'll pay for it later. But this will likely be worth it. Still, he's an obedient and faithful hound at her heels -- staying just behind, quiet and attentive; nevermind that he has to dip his head and tilt just slightly to get through all the damn doors in the building.


Janine is fortyish, petite and pretty in a severe way; she lets the Mayor know his visitors are here, and then gestures them on through. The expensive wooden doors lead through to a perfectly nice office; the desk is heavy, solid wood, but nothing in here shouts of ostentation. On said desk, apparently in use as a paperweight, is a standard handgun with the end of the barrel moulded into a face. Paperweight, :P


The Mayor stands in front of his desk; he turns to face the door as it opens, smiling broadly. ""Good afternoon! I'm so sorry about the security, you know how things can be these days."" He offers his hand to Magda.


The hand receives nothing but the brunt of a stare. Magda has eyes like razorblades: not much now, as they glint and swipe over, but later it'll surely sting. She stands there, not that tall, not that impressive, but enough to invade the office, imposing upon its impeccable neatness with her ruffled, wrinkled self. She steps forward like a hungry animal, civilities all but escaping her, etiquette something she locked up years ago like a common thug. ""Isn't it, though,"" she speaks around her teeth. ""Strange enough, buddy, that's what I'm here to talk to you about.""


Hellboy just nods his head, and rumbles a polite, ""Sir,"" again, even as Magda serves to be the bitch that he's come to know and at the very least, respect. He dips his head, then, and moves over to stay just aside, his eyes straying to the gun; taking in caliber, care, and of course -- Ed's /face/ glaring out at the world. :P ... Yeah, that's Ed.


The Mayor is not surprised, but he *is* disappointed at Magda's terrible manners. That much shows plainly in his expression. He nods to her, though, and circles his desk to sit down. There are chairs placed for the others, and he indicates them with a small gesture. ""Won't you both sit, and tell me what this is about?""


Magda is perfectly calm. She is perfectly rational. ""I am not gonna fuckin' sit down!""

Just not now.

Ever the woman without that concept of personal space, she comes prowling up to the desk, looming viciously on the other side as her gloved hands come SLAMMING down to punctuate her point. ""This ain't no sitting down matter! This is about one of your boys firing at a child. You hear me? A CHILD!"" Her teeth mash, lips curled away from them, nostrils flared and grey eyes aimed like things worse than the glock she had to give up. They only avert momentarily, one twitching as she finally takes in the silly little paperweight, the thing only reinforcing her rage. ""What sort of power trip does this position give you, that gives you the fucking right to open fire on children?!""


""One might note he didn't fire on anybody, Magda,"" Hellboy offers quietly, though he does take the seat, his tail looping up over the arm. He nods courteously to the mayor, and offers, ""And Ed is a child -- a metahuman child, also. Who has powers beyond normal ken, and probably what most of the officers on the force are not entirely used to. Which..."" He looks askance at Magda before she starts screaming bloody treason at him and tells him he can pack and get out of the house by nightfall, ""Which is not much of an excuse. Flimsy at best. But there's gotta be a middle ground, especially what with Beacon Harbor playing host to so many immigrants from only they know where.""


The Mayor gazes up at Magda, sandy eyebrows raised. He doesn't look offended; in fact, his only concession to the force of her rage is that he lowers his voice. ""Officer St. Matthews, either you can sit down, and we'll discuss what happened like civilized people, or I will call security, and you will be arrested. And I don't want to do that! None of us wants that, on such a wonderful day."" Now Hellboy speaks up, and the Mayor breaks into a broad, sunny smile. See - here's a man with some intelligence. ""Oh *heck* yes. All I'm really asking for is a chance to explain myself, here, gosh."" The 'gosh' might seem like overkill on anyone else.


Poison spreading across her face, Magda looks apt to open that loud mouth of hers and say some more -- her voice then cut off by Hellboy's explanation. She whips a furious glare back on him, her lanky body arching with the barbed breath it must release. Her hands fist with a creak of leather. Thankfully, the Mayor knows well to divert her temper. ""Civilities?"" she asks of him, her palms clapping once on the desktop before she disengages. ""Civilities went out the fuckin' window when it became OK to shoot a kid. But hey!"" The woman spreads her arms in invitation. ""Great! Let's do that! You call your security, and they can open fire on me too! I wouldn't wanna go against office fuckin' policy!"" She waits there, a bastion of impotent rage, such a calm woman when she's not playing a failed mother. She crosses her arms, still standing brutally, the best look of interrogation on her face. ""Fine. Explain. Let's hear it.""


Hellboy quietly listens, feeling the burn of Magda's eyes and her judgment; he'll get angry at her for it later, and they can have their row. Magda doesn't realize it, but he's had to be part politician in his day -- earning his rights and defending his ability to have, keep and enjoy them. But he can be a plainspoken, blunt man, and he's not here. ""Magda's got a point,"" In her own, foul mouthed sort of way, ""sir, but we are listenin'.""


The Mayor sits back in his seat and regards Magda, considering her closely. Then he shakes his head. ""No. I'm sorry, Officer St. Matthews, but you don't see me sweeping into your place of work and cussing and being just downright impolite. So either you can wind yourself down and I'll tell you what happened, and what's been done about it, or you can turn yourself around and I'll see you on the Fourth of July."" He sees everyone on the 4th of July. Innocent blue eyes flick to Hellboy - tell her, will you?


Magda positively seethes. Her jaw closes with an audible click of molars. But beneath all this fury, there really is something of a rational woman, a cop who's had a past of good work on an impeccable record. Very rarely is she ever seen this angry, and even more unusual is that her anger has lasted this long without burning out. But despite all her violence, she's got her resigned nature poking though, and it lets itself be settled just this moment. Fine. She'll be diplomatic or whatever. She raises her hands in a signal of surrender, backing off, and parks herself in an empty chair. Magda sits as loaded as a spring.


Hellboy sighs softly, palming his face with the big, right hand. Well, at least he's a reasonable, calm man, Hellboy figures. Serves well to have someone in office like him in this assbackwards town. Still, he's probably swamped with things he can't fix and rules he can't break. But he glances to Magda, and watches her cave. ""We're listening,"" he says again to the mayor, his tail curling at the tip. Even /he's/ tense now.


Good! The Mayor smiles, but it's a small, restrained smile, and it fades into seriousness as he sits forward with his hands clasped on the table. ""Now. I know the incident to which you're referring, and I can only offer my deep, abiding apologies. The security in City Hall is high, but *obviously* to discharge a firearm at a child is beyond the pale. I'm only relieved that the young man in question wasn't hurt.""


The aggravated woman doesn't slant a single look on Hellboy, rather regarding him like he doesn't even exist. He's been added to her shit list, a long, macabre tome which writ in blood is just about everyone in this goddamned mood. That's how terrible Magda's mood is right now. She sits stiffly, gloved hands fisted and settled on the arms of the chair, her eyes honed on the Mayor and never looking away. Confusion tints her at the apology, and though she looks like she'd rather scowl at it, she doesn't. ""He is,"" she affirms of Edward, making no motion to say anything more of the boy. ""I realize he broke into here, and he's going to be dealt with for that. But -- it makes me sick in the gut knowing that you guys resorted to something like that. For what? How's this situation going to be dealt with?""


""Ed's an idiot kid -- and he meant no harm, merely looking for information in ways he shouldn't have -- but he's not criminal."" Much. Really. Ahem. Hellboy ignores the fact that Magda is radiating hate like a campfire does heat, but he continues to speak in turn after her. ""I'd like to know if it's standard procedure, however, to open fire on presumed metahumans -- as an extra precaution, of course,"" And he says that without a drop of hostility or sarcasm!, ""or whether this was the action of a poorly trained officer and he will be dealt with summarily."" He's giving the mayor a clear out to clean this up easily, and he's hoping he'll take it honestly; Hellboy has had to be on the opposite end of this chair before -- the one explaining a teammates actions, or why a mission went south. It's never easy. It's never good. But it has to be dealt with, carefully and for the greater good.


This is so much nicer. Everyone's talking calmly. The Mayor listens attentively to both of them, and spreads his hands in a little 'what can you do' gesture. ""The officer's actions were *not* standard policy, I can assure you. I am a great advocate of metahuman equality, as you may have noticed from my letters to the Beacon Crier."" He looks hopefully at the pair of them. You've read those, right? Right? ""You may both rest assured that nothing like this will ever be allowed to happen again. For such a talented young man to lose his life over what was only a mistake - well, it's unforgivable.""


Eyes hooded, a dark look still capturing her, Magda doesn't look too pliant to the approaching pleasantries. She's not going to shake her head in that Ah, Gee sort of way and compare notes on how deplorable acts have that way of happening. She sits there, looking as loaded as a gun, by all appearances calm but so close to a snap. Whatever this is, it's deeply personal to her, her expression and body language so open that her avenging heart's bleeding right out. ""Who's the officer that pulled the gun? How're you dealing with 'em? I want to know the action you're taking because of this.""


Hellboy has read them. He reads the paper religiously. Get up. Get coffee, paper, pancakes. It's the morning ritual. But he actually doesn't say anything against Magda's request -- he finds it reasonable to know what's being done. He just sits, a quiet shadow in the other chair, his tail practically corkscrewed.


And now some fast thinking is required. Thankfully the Mayor isn't just a pretty face. ""The officer in question has been removed from active duty, and is undergoing extensive retraining. I also have somebody from your department, Officer, looking at the tapes to see if a criminal offense has been committed. Though - "" He grimaces, clearly pained. ""I wouldn't want to have to put the young man on the stand. He's been through quite enough.""


Mention of that makes Magda frown. Though she does not admit that, she agrees with the Mayor there. As much as a part of her screams for justice, she's reserved from wanting Edward anywhere near the courts. It doesn't sit well. ""So the tapes have been sent over?"" she affirms instead, a note of approval in her voice -- that of someone who fully expects to review them for herself. She rubs uselessly at her jaw, her anger apparently settling, her raspy voice low and restrained. ""And would I be able to meet with that officer sometime? I'd like to chat. Hear his'r her side of the story.""


A flicker of something passes over Hellboy's expression, and he calmly interjects, ""That would be ugly, indeed. After all, Ed is an immigrant and is likely not aware of the rights he'd be entitled to. Someone could easily manipulate him one way or the other, in a court room, as he has little experience with the law structure of this world."" Which is to say he agrees with Magda's assessment: he doesn't want it pursued either. Still, as for the rest, it is best left undiscussed by him; he won't be meeting anybody on the force, after all, other then his roommate and landlady.


""Exactly,"" the Mayor says to Hellboy, with some feeling. It's so nice to see huge red demonic people taking their rightful place in society. ""The BHPD has the tapes, and you're welcome to ask to see them, though obviously I can't get involved in permissions."" He looks a little regretful. ""As to meeting the officer - I'll see what I can do, but I can't promise. I'm not even sure if that officer will be returning to work here, just yet.""


""I'd appreciate if you could,"" Magda tells the Mayor on a dead voice, deeply hoping she could get some chum time with the officer in question. If not, she find herself sorely tempted to attempt some civil servant research to get to the bottom of this. ""And I really hope you're as sincere as you sound. I hope this sort of thing isn't commonplace. City Hall's the least of all places I'd like to be investigating a kid's murder."" With that, the woman slowly rises from her chair, nerves shot and body language starting to linger. Her pale eyes pass over the office once, thoughtfully.


Hellboy rises as Magda does, and nods his head. Yes, great big red demonic guys that have common sense AND are... rising the what ladder to what place in society? Oh, he's just talkin' sense is all! See what you get done when you talk sense? But he does take in the office as well, and the mayor, calming steadily. See, this worked out just fine. ""Thank you for your time and your willingness to discuss this, sir,"" he says, even after Magda expresses her own appreciation for something she may not get.


As Magda rises, the Mayor does too; he smiles to Hellboy. ""Oh, you're welcome. Would you like a bookmark?"" He fetches one from a little desk drawer and offers it over; it's faux-leather, in navy blue, and the Lighthouse is picked out on it in gold. The text running along the side reads 'BEACON HARBOR'. It has a fringe at the bottom. ""Oh, heavens, no. No, Officer St. Matthews, I can assure you, nothing like this will be allowed to happen again. Thank you for taking the time to come and see me."" Like she's done him a favour. He offers his hand.


As the snarling, swearing, storming, slaughtering officer of the law sees a bookmark, whatever righteous venom she had crashes like the AmEx. Magda tilts her head like a mutt, her eyes narrowing dumbly on the thing, the look on her face absolutely derailed. It doesn't last long; the corners of her mouth tighten the moment the Mayor offers his hand. She did not accept it before, but now, her eyes lidding, the woman decides to pull the leather glove off her right hand before obliging him. ""Good to know that,"" she rumbles distractedly.


Hellboy accepts the bookmark with a smile and a nod, ""Thank you,"" again coming from him. Hey, whatever. Ed can use it to mark his place in his strange texts. But he looks to Magda again, his brows furrowing just slightly; all right, she's somewhat defused. He'll still hear about what he had to say later, he's certain, but at least they'll get to the car before she starts with the screaming and punching. He hopes.


The Mayor takes Magda's hand; his handshake is perfect and warm, and he brings his left hand - the one with the wedding ring - up to cradle hers briefly between his palms. ""I'm so glad we were able to settle this without any unpleasantness,"" he says. And - he *is* glad. He really is. He's worried, and genuinely dismayed that a child almost died as a result of his security forces' incompetence. It's the reading of a nice guy with a lot on his mind. But beneath that is a current of something *else*, a dark, howling emptiness, something *missing* and replaced only by soulless purpose. It's like picking up an apple and having your fingers sink into the rotten flesh, like maggots crawling in the pit of an eye, like the blank, idiot grin of an empty skull. He had a young wife, called Edna Mae, and they danced on the grass of the Park under oil lanterns. He stayed by her side while she withered into senility and old age and became a dried-up thing that could only hate him. He -- smiles broadly, squeezes Magda's hand, and lets go. ""I'd love to ask you to stay a little longer, but I'm just snowed under in here. If you ever need anything, either of you, I sure hope you'll think to give me a call.""


It is always the same. The moment the Mayor's wedding ring scrapes her hand, its band pressing against the life line of her palm, she feels it happen like a vice over her heart. Magda has to close her eyes for a moment. They open to show her a bleary world of half-light ruled by choking darkness. She blinks several times, a mistake, a jarring movement freezing her on the spot, tensing her hand to feel like a wall between his. She nearly pales, her breath coming up shallow, her eyes twitching side-to-side as though reading text from an invisible book. One that tells her stories she does not like to hear. Her eyes film over, and the woman does not -- cannot move until her hand is dropped. The return to reality startles her, her head jerked to one side and her shoulders giving a bob, and now that angry, avenging woman has trouble standing on her own two feet. She stares at the Mayor, looking an instant like he had slapped her, eyes whorling this way and that, her jaw clamping tight. She clears her throat, already backing up, moving as though she were in a daze. ""Yeah. Call. I -- yeah,"" she says emptily. And she goes. Just like that.


Hellboy takes in the moment between Magda and the Mayor without a second thought. He watches with what could be called knowing eyes, and they are. Are they ever. he knows what he sees -- he's seen it before. Sydney Leach, man of talented hands. But he says nothing. Nothing at all. Just puts that big, massive right hand on Magda's shoulders to steady her in silent support, and dips his head, offering, ""We'll be in touch,"" as calmly as he can.

Then he steers Magda carefully out of the building and back to the car. He doesn't ask for the keys there -- he just takes them, soon as they're out. ""I'll drive. You recover. We'll talk when you're you again.""


That reaction was rather hard to miss. The Mayor lifts his eyebrows, but doesn't pass comment. It's not like it actually *matters*. Maybe she's just holy or something inconvenient like that. ""You two have a good day now!"" Aw. Weren't they nice.


For the longest of times, Magda is a puppet. A marionette. She walks through life as though it were a dream, not really seeing it, not really hearing it, not really meeting eyes with the security guards as they smile and return her weapon. Her eyes are large and empty, something stolen from them, dark now and reflecting nothing. She allows herself to be led, moving like a cold machine, taking her time because she must. She doesn't say much, a tense look on her face. She's not talking because she's thinking, and those thoughts don't look like good ones.

The woman reanimates like Frankenstein's monster the instant her keys are snagged, and all at once, her head jerks left and right. For the first time, she seems to realize she's away from the office, outside, beside her truck, and being talked to. She tenses immediately, letting out an unpleasant, slurred snarl as she tries to feint away from the guiding hand and any further touches, demanding space. ""Just shut up. Don't talk to me.""


""All right."" Hellboy says, opening the passenger side door for her, before he goes to the driver's side. He's firm on this; she just had a psychic episode, and that's not okay for driving right after, you know. It's like drinking and driving. You don't psychometry and drive. Hellboy gets in the driver's seat whether or not she screams or fumes or whatever she chooses to do. He just rests his big right hand on the wheel for a moment, before he starts the truck.


Sourly, Magda yanks on her glove, tugging the black leather down to cover her whole hand. Even then, the woman is still a twitchy, nervous mass, hardly a muscle in her deigning to remain still. Her nerves are absolutely shot, and silently her lips move, talking to herself. She shoots Hellboy a poisonous look, her mood in a dark, dark place, the tension in her one that's craving to snap at the first face she sees. She pauses now at the proffered door, reaching for it, but she gets a good look at the driver before she gets in, and remains decidedly planted on the sidewalk. Some part of her remembers that she's pretty damn angry with him. She's angry with the world. She feels like -- her head wants to explode. What the hell was that? And why won't her heart stop hammering? ""Listen. You go home. Wherever. I need to -- think."" Drink. Stare at grass. Walk around. Try to figure out which thoughts are hers.


""Why didn't you tell me you were a psychometrist?"" He asks, despite the fact that she told him /not/ to talk. He slides an arm back on the back of the seat, looking over at her with fathomless, too-dark eyes; a flicker of fire is behind them. ""Or is it uncontrolled? -- You can't predict when the ... snippets, the thoughts you glean from other people, will come when you touch them?"" That would explain the gloves -- among other things. He ignores that she's angry. Or that he was told to go home and leave her alone. He ignores /everything/ she said without a blink of the eye. And he just keeps talking.


""A psycho-WHAT?"" she snarls, her voice toxic. Magda burns like an ember, not that big, not that bad, but with just enough gasoline, she could be a roaring inferno. It's there in her eyes, in the irritable set of her stubborn jaw, in the way her trembling, nervous hand digs into the handle of the car door. She stares at him incredulously as he talks, hearing him but not, the world as she knows it becoming something dark and lurking before her eyes. She has to shake it away. And he's still talking. Trying to talk to her. Everything please just stop talking. ""I am not a fucking psychoanything! Would you just leave me alone? Can't anyone leave me the fuck alone?"" Magda snaps, her voice barking out faster than a jackhammer. The aggravation goes resigned, and she grunts out a finalizing, ""Fuck this,"" before she steps back, slamming the truck door shut. The woman begins to stalk down the street.


Hellboy gets out of the car, sighing softly as he pockets the keys. And he begins to pursue - he's not the type to leave well enough alone. ""Sydney Leach -- he was an agent. He had a very specialized form of psychometry -- a psychic gift. He could touch things, and read their content. He was best at detecting metal, actually, but that's neither here not there. It's not that uncommon, Magda. It just makes you metahuman -- a psychic. I'm pretty sure this world has native metas, doesn't it, Mags?"" Is it the threat to her job it poses? Does she just not understand? He doesn't know, and she probably won't tell him."

<lj-cut text=""I gave the armor the bed."">
he aforementioned suit of armor is in as close to shock as is possible with him-- when Ed hurls himself at Al, the latter brings an arm up on reflex to catch him, and it's the first move the headless suit makes. He moves unsteadily, then reaches for his head with his other hand and carefully sets it back where it belongs. ""...Brother,"" he says again, more steadily.

And that's about all anyone is going to get out of Al for quite some time, except perhaps a few quiet words if asked direct questions. He eventually climbs unsteadily to his feet to stand at his full height-- all seven feet of it... and he wordlessly reaches out to hoist his brother back up when he stumbles. Alphonse doesn't seem to process Hellboy's presence or physical appearance-- he hardly notices Magda. His attention, lacking as it is, is solely for his brother-- the only thing he recognizes. The only thing that makes sense. He has no idea what just happened to him.

He'll follow along docilely enough, but Alphonse is running on autopilot. Things can make sense in the morning.


""But --"" she babbles, her attention now turned on Hellboy the instant he touches her to help her balance. It's not quite clicking. ""That's his -- right."" Her frazzled mind darts back to her first minutes with Edward, her impeccable memory unable to fail her even now. Seven feet. Armor. Brother. But where is the rest-- Magda lets it click bitterly. It's his brother. She shakes her head and rubs her face, all questions that can wait. She lets the finality of the situation touch her: Edward did it. He did it, he concluded the wild thoughts in her head. The agony she felt for a day. He found his brother, the guy is here, they're back together -- this is really a happy ending.

All the woman can do is sag, clumsily rub the back of her neck, and let a deep breath go. Suddenly she's relieved, she's exhausted, she's weighing a thousand pounds, and she's unable to look away from Alphonse as she wryly answers Hellboy, ""Call me babe and the ending won't be that happy.""

<OOC> Hellboy takes you home, puts you to bed, gets Ed milk and cookies, wonders why Ed refuses milk, lets him eat the cookies, showers, flops on floor, wonders when life went straight into the shitter.
<OOC> Magda LAUGHS
<OOC> Magda makes it worse by laying down alongside. ""...I gave the bed to the armor.""
<OOC> Hellboy groans. ""Magda. The armor has no nerves. The armor probably could be dismantled and packed in a box and only feel mildly put out.""
<OOC> Hellboy brightideas! ""If we pad the inside of the armor, bet it's big enough for Ed to sleep in!""
<OOC> Magda says ""Not when there's a perfectly good bed!"""

"event","Ed does stupid. Ed gets lucky. Welcome home, Alphonse!

<lj-cut text=""WHERE IS THE BLOOD SEAL?!"">


It's been almost three days since Edward fled in mingled terror and guilt from Magda's house. He didn't know what the hell had happened, but he knew he'd hurt her somehow, and in his state of mind (amazing how being away from his brother chips away at his sanity, but then, that's a bit like applying a cheese grater to a stick of butter), he could not cope with that. So he grabbed his notes and ran.

He wandered fretfully for about a day, chasing the shreds of his mind in circles through the streets of Beacon Harbor. Finally, though, he came to the ruined Infinity Pit, and somehow managed to remember that this is where he'd based his plans. So he transmuted himself a nice little fort of scraps of steel and concrete and settled down to work out the last bits of alchemy he'd need to retrieve his brother.

He's been in there for about two days now, eating nothing but occasionally remembering to pull some moisture from the muggy summer air into drinkable form so that he doesn't go loopy with dehydration (which doesn't stop him from going loopy with other things, but that's another story). He accidentally fell asleep for a few hours last night from sheer exhaustion, only to be even more disgusted with himself when he awoke. Mostly, though, he's been feverishly going through his notes, chalking arrays on the concrete, then shaking his head and transmuting the chalkdust back into stick form so he can try again.

He's achingly tired, sore from his awkward quarters, ravenous with hunger and thirst, sticky with sweat, and filthy with less determinable substances. The wound just beyond the metal of his right shoulder seems to have avoided infection, but it doesn't look like it's healing very well, either. Trickles of dried blood smear his automail, his black undershirt, and the hollows of his throat, and the injury has been opening up again every few hours.

None of that matters now. What matters is that Ed is sure he's finally got this just right. Hand trembling a little, he starts in on the final touches to his huge, convoluted array. It'll all be all right. He's going to get his brother back.



Clomp. Clomp. Clomp. That's not a Clysdale -- that's Hellboy. Edward should know the sound of those hoofbeats well; it's hard for Hellboy to 'tiptoe' after all, whether it be because he's come home late from afterwork drinking, or whether because he doesn't want to wake anybody at five am when he's got to shower or something. He's just naturally loud. Hard to hide over fourhundred pounds of muscle and rock.

He's overlooking the infinity pit -- at it's very edge. It's huge. Effin' huge. ""This is got to be where he came,"" he says to Magda, poor woman he's dragged along. ""It's -- well, maybe it's not such a crazy idea, but if he's... not himself after..."" Whatever it was that happened. ""He... may do something very wrong."" And it may make the world implode for all he knows. Anything that alters reality is /bad/ in his book. Playing with it? Well, it sounded good at the time -- he even got Ed books! -- but... 

Now? He's thinking he should have taken the kid over his knee. But homesickness won out over common sense. Now? Hellboy knows very well he's not going home. Ever.

""Let's go find him,"" he says, before he begins to inch down into the wreckage, feeling every wiry, black hair stand on end. This is not a good place to be. Here and there he sees flashes -- things no one else can see -- and wonders at the poor souls still bound to this horrible ruin. You'd think the government would clean it up--somehow. Not just /leave/ it like this... Ah well. Nice ot know the state, here or his own world, still has it's head firmly shoved up it's collective ass.


It's been a hard two days for Magda. She spent half of it unresponsive, unaware to the world, playing a vegetable rather than a woman. With her gift -- her curse -- she has trouble grazing murder weapons and family heirlooms. And then she touched Edward's automail. Not just a feeling thing, but to grip it, clench it, and deal with the thoughts and the emotions of years upon years...

It was many, many hours for her mind to parse it all, to find a hole through the endless waves and surface back to reality. Though she has not given a single reason why for that odd bout of catatonia, it soon broke with a clamour of screams and struggling, her mindless shrieks asking for a certain boy who did not come back home.

Her hands are gloved now, her face garbing itself too with a steely look, eyes narrowed and jaw tight to ward off that ghostly expression that's been possessing her since she came to. Or maybe she's just sick with worry.

Now she stands at Hellboy's side at the edge of the ruins, the land sunken low like a pock mark scarring the city, and she rubs at her aching crown with a gloved hand. His words make her heart sink. ""He can't be here. It's dangerous here. It's no good --"" she speaks like she's convincing herself. In the end, she follows, feeling anxiety make her stomach do loops as she scrapes down the steep incline, her body still wobbly, her nerves frayed, and half the thoughts in her head not even her own.


Inside his self-made fortress, Edward peers up nervously through carefully-constructed slits (he can see out through them but it's quite hard to see in) at the sound of hooves. He somehow doubts that this signifies a horse. ""Shit,"" he mutters hoarsely under his breath. ""Not now!""

No. Not now, not when he's *so close*. He frantically sketches in the last few arcane markings on his array, then lets out a ragged breath and closes his eyes for a moment. Then he hurriedly jerks them open--now is *not* the time to fall asleep. Not that he could, anyway, with adrenaline tapdancing through his veins.

He settles both hands on the array. They are bare, no gloves hiding flesh or metal. ""Told you I'd take care of you, Al,"" he murmurs. ""I'll get you back and I'll get your body back, I promise."" And the lines of chalk begin to glow.

The bright light soon fills the bunker and spills out through those narrow slits and airholes, replacing the failing sunlight in this dismal place.


Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot.

Hellboy is not used to Ed's strange powers --he's never really seen them in action. At least, not more then a broken plate or anything. But this! This is all glowing and bad! BAD! ""Shit, shit, shit!"" is all he can breath out, his thick brows furrowing as he sees the small hovel in the distance begin to glow. ""Well, at least he gave us a clear signal,"" he says, tail thrashing back and forth. ""Let's go get him before he hurts himself."" and the rest of the city. State. Country. WORLD. 

He doesn't really think about anything, other then plowing his way over wreckage and through junk -- and he takes a good leap that clears maybe twenty feet, dropping him down deeper into the pit, crushing wreckage beneath his massive feet; he staggers, just a little, on landing, but is quickly righting himself and heading down, looking for another good place to jump and land, trying to make it to the hovel as fast as he can. He doesn't want Ed to screw everything up. He doesn't want Ed to kill them all. He just wants to take Ed over his knee and spank him for being a retard, and then find out what's wrong with his housemates and fix them. It's all good, see?


Magda knows that light.

It makes her trip, her boots catching on the crumbling earth, and she stops in a sharp but dirtied crouch, hands shot down, head picked up, eyes turned in time to see that flareshot grow the twisted, gnarled shadows of the ruins. Her insides churn, her heart stings, and she feels the insides of her molars ache.

Scrambling back up, she barely has the time to catch Hellboy's jump out of the corner of the eyes, his ability giving her only momentary pause. Though left in his wake, she races after, her boots scraping gravel, landing briskly on haphazard stepstones of sheet metal and rock. She is unable to clear such unnatural distances on her own, but desperation gives her strength, and a vicious one at that.

Jesus Christ Jesus Christ this isn't happening this isn't good this isn't -- ""ED!"" Magda screams out suddenly, her voice sharp, catching on the end like the matted steel does in this broken land.


The glow brightens, reaching blue-white fingers out over the ruins, casting strange shadows on an already eerie landscape. There is no response from within the little fort, and judging by the way the light spills out, there doesn't seem to be any exit, either. Why make a way out and leave it there when he can transmute one any time he likes?

Within the steel-and-concrete walls, where the light is all but blinding, Edward concentrates on shutting himself off from the rest of the world. None of it matters now, and he can't let himself be distracted by things that don't matter. One eyelid twitches at the sound of Magda's voice, at her scream--but his alchemy is unaffected. That's the important part.

Outside, a new light slithers into being, a thin line of crackling blue brilliance that extends far above the ground and smells faintly of ozone. It flickers and writhes, but doesn't fade.


Hellboy stops, just for a moment, as the scent of ozone teases him. He looks up, then, and -- oh lord. That's not good. That's not good at /all/. He's going to flush the whole world right down the toilet for his brother! Dammit! ""Ed!"" he shouts, moving again, ""Ed, goddamn it, you can't /do/ this here, you'll kill people!"" Or maybe not. He's not sure. HE doesn't want that risk, though -- not when he can stop it.

He's never been one for doors, though. He'll as quick go through a wall -- stone, concrete, steel, it doesn't matter; once he's up to it, he's punching it; no metal here will stand up to that right hand; he can tear through it like tissue. It's the unstoppable force and nothing /here/ resembles the immovable object. Two strikes, and it's through, and he's ripping aside wall and roof, like one might open a candy wrapped on a massive scale, peeling back the gleaming metal to get at the prize inside...


That new light that crackles upwards, high into the sky? That's where it starts. A low pulsing, like the heartbeat of the earth, sends ultra-low frequency waves outwards in all directions. It's a primal rumble that shakes the chest just as surely as high bass on a stereo. Thump, thump, thump-- and with each thump, that strange light pulsates methodically. A metronome high in the sky, growing brighter with each rumble. And brighter. And brighter. And then it flares like magnesium without warning-- some scientific experiment gone horribly wrong-- and that deep thrumming crescendos into a single loud clap of thunder.

There's a rush of air and a bright blue-white sphere hovering up there, high above the Infinity Pit... and it spits something out. No fanfare, no trumpets blaring. Where there was nothing, there is now something falling-- a dark, irregular shape, silhouetted against the brilliant nova of a searing blue-white light that illuminates even the deepest shadows surrounding the pit. It burns into Edward's hovel, mixing with the Alchemic light-- it digs its way into crevasses and worms like a living thing into places that mere sunlight could never reach. Above, the falling thing is buffeted by winds and strange forces that have no right to disobey physical laws. It falls, slows, twists in mid-air-- gravity catches and releases it at random, it seems. In Beacon Harbor, that dark shape could be anything under the sun; demon, angel, monster, child. Its motives could be benevolent or cruel, its powers laughable or potentially catastrophic. And yet, through luck or the conspiracies of space, time, and fate, the unwavering faith and determination of a teenaged boy is rewarded. In part. The dark shape casts a distinctive shadow as it plummets-- it is an armored thing, the light lancing and reflecting off a metallic surface... and above the thunder and the rush of wind, the sound of a child's oddly metallic scream rips through the air.


Edward is not a delicious candy center. He's rather too crunchy, for one, and leaves a metallic aftertaste. Mostly, though, he's just too small. Anyone getting him inside their chocolate egg would feel gypped.

When the constructed roof of his bunker tears off in Hellboy's powerful hands, he doesn't so much as blink. The only indication that he's even noticed is the way he tenses, the way his jaw goes taut and angry.

Likewise he does not notice when something else entirely takes over the tear in reality. He's too busy concentrating. The glowing light of the arcane symbols of his array brightens suddenly, its color losing the blue tinge and going to red.

And it seems that the previous manifestation of the Infinity Effect had nothing at all to do with the alchemy, since now the results are showing up very differently. The reek of ozone sears the air, and flame-like tongues of crackling, sputtering blue wrap around the outstretched broken beams and juts of concrete, then leap, blazing, high into the sky. Bits and pieces of ground and metal go flying to the accompaniment of abrupt popping noises as parts of the scenery explode.

Finally, Edward looks up, right past Hellboy as if the giant red demon-man didn't even register, and breaks into a huge grin. ""Al! Al, it worked, it--""

He cuts off abruptly, expression numbing, eyes going glassy, as tendrils of blue light converge on the armored shape like a predator to its luckless prey.


It's the scream that gets Hellboy -- he looks up abruptly, his orange eyes widening in vague horror. Shit, shit, shit. Kids raining from the fucking sky and it's going to hit and down here, there's no one going to be able to catch him and not -- not have him /die/. Not from that high. They're not /him/. Still, Ed's cry begins him from that revirie and he blinks. Al? Oh, hell, the kid will be fine. Dented, but that's nothing a hammer won't fix. Right? Right...

And then he sees the ... thing go wrong. He looks up, and stares. ""Shit."" 

But then he looks to Ed, and says, ""Armor, right? He can't be hurt, right?""

Not waiting for an answer, he moves, finding the nearest slab of concrete left mostly unharmed. A punch, then another -- and he wrestles forth a javelin thin steel girder -- the type used to keep concrete in shape. He straightens it, takes aim, and throws.


Hisll he needs to do is knock Al JUST off course. If he's got a girded through him, it's not gonna hurt. Ed can fix him right up. Right? 

Right!


The scream absolutely breaks Magda. Flashes of unnatural light and falling shapes do well to freeze her in place, wall her breath in her throat, stop her heart, but a child's scream galvanizes her into something terrible. Still navigating the dark journey down, bit by brutal bit, the scream makes her tumble a second time. She hits a band of metal and goes down, pushed up on one arm with a cry of her own. Her legs are shaky, and her knees want to give out at any time. But not now.

Finally on the level, she pushes up for a run, hissing in a ragged breath as she races blindly for the heart of the ruins. Towards the light. Towards the explosions. Towards the -- what the HELL is going on?! She keeps calling Ed's name; it's the only word she knows right now.


Like falcons stooping on clumsy pigeons, the tumbling shape finds itself skewered at the center of that predatory light-- the fall is abruptly halted, and the scream cuts off as quickly as it had begun. Held up by invisible forces, the armored form starts to struggle, lashing out against the blue-white lightning that crawls over him and digs into each joint, each slit, each hairline opening in the metallic suit. It's no good. You can't hit light. His struggling intensifies-- it's hard to see amidst the glare, but the dark form starts to claw at itself, dangling in place like a puppet with irreparably tangled strings. Swat, flail, struggle-- and then the light flares again, and another scream sounds shrilly over the thunder-rumble.

It hurts. That's all he knows. It shouldn't hurt-- he shouldn't be able to feel it-- but he can. Nerves he no longer has burn with the pain of it. Limbs he hasn't seen in years feel like they're ripping away from a body he lost long ago. Al screams like he'll never stop screaming-- the high-pitched sound a rabbit makes just before the fox snaps its neck. 

The light begins to change-- intense blue-white becomes the soft transparent purple-blue of incredibly hot flame, and the temperature around the pit immediately rises. The winds swirl hot and dry, feeding oxygen to this strange new site. The screaming fades into shocked silence as the fabric worn around Alphonse's waist suddenly catches on fire-- the flare of orange flame throws strange shadows up under the emotionless metal mask, and it's somehow enough to make a suit of armor look terrified. The metal javelin thrown by Hellboy hits home, and it's the least of Al's worries, because the deep blue flame is so very hot... hot enough that the javelin, wedged tightly below his left pauldron, is already glowing red. Glowing red... and then melting, melting like hot butter-- and dripping like molten rain into the pit below. 

And Al's armor is beginning to glow, too.


""ALPHONSE!"" The scream tears out of Edward's throat like a hawk held captive there, bloody and furious. He lunges to his feet, both hands flung out to clutch at the sky. ""No! No, this isn't how it's supposed to work! It's--NO!"" He falls to his hands and knees once more and starts scrubbing incoherently at the array on the ground. His right hand draws up an unpleasant grating noise and his left hand bleeds, but the markings continue to glow--the alchemy might as well have a will of its own now.

And high above, the heat crawls up to the point where it puts just a bit too much stress on the armor.

It's all rather undignified, really. Bits and pieces of Al rain down on the rough ground mere feet away from Ed's ex-bunker, forming a semi-fused heap of vaguely armor-shaped metal.

Ed's off his feet and running in under a second, ignoring the fresh pain on his left palm and the by now familiar one of his gunshot wound reopening under stress. Likewise he ignores the pain of new burns as he desperately shifts and pokes at the mess of nearly-molten metal. ""Al! Al, what happened, what--the seal where's the *seal*.""

He gives up on something so coherent as speech and screams like the world is ending as he flings himself bodily against the sizzling heap.


Not enough. Goddamn it, it wasn't enough. But Hellboy is quick to be atop Ed, to reach out and try and prevent himself from causing himself even more reason for a trip to the hospital (not to mention the mental ward) after all of this. He's quick to, to throw back, violently, to keep him from burning himself to so many cinders.

""I can touch him,"" he says. ""It won't burn me! I can't be burned. Not ever!"" he snarls at the boy. ""Now tell me what you're looking for!"" 

The Seal. What seal? An alchemic seal, of course -- he looks, then, trying to find something among the heated, warped mess, murmuring to the boy -- can he even hear him? -- ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I tried. If you're still alive, let us both know."" His left hand is gentle for one so strong; even his touch on the armor would not cause that softened metal to bend and fold.


Breathing harshly, winded from fear, Magda's wild steps seizure as figures finally come into sight. Familiar ones. She moves rather than thinks, her reflexes fast and handy, and the moment Ed is brutally tossed back, she's skidding, down on her knees, coming to a disturbed crash beside the broken boy to throw her arms around him. Should he struggle, she tries to hang on, and should he try to launch back towards the burning scene, she'll try to hold him back.

Her heart jackhammers in her ribcage, and as much as she breathes in, the world wants to fog in front of her eyes -- still burned with webbing images of the crackling fingers of light. And all she can remember are those screams. ""Ed, Ed,"" she rambles over and over, a gloved hand touching his fact to try to get his momentary attention, ""are you OK?! You hurt?! You --"" Her eyes turn, attention darted back on Hellboy. His words confuse her, but she doesn't speak now, letting her sight flare briefly, incredulously on the burning slabs of armor before they return on Ed.


For all Edward's prodigious flailing, he's quite helpless when faced with Hellboy's strength. Especially given that he's not precisely sane at the moment. He's flung back from the heap of semi-molten metal that used to be armor. Finally, the scream cuts off--although only because he needs to take a breath, and once he's done so, he finds that he's too busy trembling and sobbing to scream.

""The blood seal,"" he manages to get out between choked whimpers. ""It's what anchors Al's soul to the armor, he's *gone* without it--it's got to be there somewhere, he can't--*no*!"" Ed drops to his knees and clutches helplessly at his head, smearing blood all over his left temple--not that it's not trickling down his back from the days-old wound anyway. He's heedless of Magda's arms around him, and he gives no answers to her questions. He seems to have used up every last drop of his remaining coherence to give Hellboy that hysterical explanation.


He finds it -- most of it. ""It's there!"" he finally says -- but does not add the unspoken 'sort of'. Carefully, he waves Ed over, to see the seal -- it's not quite right, but... It's there. ""Your blood's there, Ed."" His /soul/ is still there, even if Al's not answering. He carefully touches near the seal, and then asks, ""If I take it out -- if I pick up the metal, and keep it together, can you transfer it to another bit of armor? Metal? Whatever? Meld it?"" He wants to know before he tries, his hand carefully hovering nearby. Just say the word, and what's left of Al goes into Hellboy's hands.


""Ed,"" she keeps saying now and then, her voice small and different, so far from that gravelly thing that sounds like it shouldn't care. Magda all but clamps Edward to herself, her shallow breath nicking and catching as her eyes catch new rivulets of blood on the boy. She clamps one gloved hand against the cut on his face, watching him a frowning, detached moment, before Hellboy's voice again talks to Ed and tries to deal with this situation. All she can do is watch, her eyes between them, before her hands tighten down. ""Ed,"" she tries to coax. ""You can hear him talking. Tell 'em what he needs to do. Open your eyes, Ed.""


It takes a precious minute before Magda's small, sane voice works its way in through the cracks in Edward's skull and soaks into his brain. Finally, he looks up at her, golden eyes huge, tears streaking crazily down his cheeks. There are no wounds on his face, at least--the blood there is just from the raw scrape on his left palm. Not that this makes it all that much better.

Slowly, he gets to his feet and stumbles over to stare at the wreck of his brother. ""That's--"" His gaze hollow, he reaches out his right hand to almost touch the seal. ""You don't understand. I gave my arm to bind Al's soul to that armor. I don't know if I could do it again. I--"" He drops to his hands and knees again and just shakes. ""I can repair the armor, easy,"" he says hoarsely. ""That's just a little alchemy. But the seal--""


""Then do it -- repair the armor. You can dissipate the heat and put it to rights without issue -- the seal is there, whole, right?"" Hellboy insists. God idiot kid, he wants to smack him for being this stupid -- if he'd just not done this, if he hadn't played around, maybe Al would have come here on his own, maybe hit the ground without passing through a raging fucking fire, maybe - 

Goddamn, too many /maybes/. ""Do it. I know you can. If you repair the shell, and keep the seal... The seal's there, Ed! Just /try/! You worked this hard to bring him here, now you're going to waffle about /may/ saving his life? Goddamn boy, which is it going to /be/?!""


Nothing of Hellboy's anger is reflected in Magda. That harsh, callous woman only has time to feel her heart break, her encouraging eyes meeting Edward's for only a moment. She's so loath of touch, and especially now, yet still a gloved thumb moves to swathe one of the boy's tears away. She lets him go to stand, still crouched on the balls of her feet, breathing hard as her eyes turn up to gauge the scene. Talk of alchemy, arrays, blood... she stays out of it, but it doesn't mean her erratic heart will stop pounding.


It takes a minute, a long minute where Edward just trembles and sobs on the ground until he's gasping and hiccuping. Finally, he looks up, eyes bright with tears and desperation. ""Yeah. You're right. I've still got an arm and a leg to spare, after all."" He makes a noise which might be a giggle if not for the utter seriousness of the words he's trying to pass off as a shot at humor.

Wobbling only slightly, he rises to his feet, then claps his hands together. Blood smears on metal. Then he sets both hands on the heap of former armor, heedless off the seething heat.

The bluish glow of alchemy envelopes the mess, and when it recedes, the armor is perfectly whole again, and cool--but instead of looking for the seal, Ed drops to his knees, sobbing helplessly. He *can't* look. He's too scared of what he won't see.


Hellboy looks. Quietly. He tilts his head, looking to where the mass was, in the armor -- and remembering. And there -- he slumps. He sighs.

And then laughs. Low in his throat, thick and relieved, the tension rolling out of his shoulders. ""Seals... complete. There, Ed. Seals' there. See?"" He taps it, it's circle rust-red and ugly, but /there/.

That was far to close for his comfort. He rocks back on his hooves, looking at the armor -- at /Al/. He tilts his head, and looks at Ed. ""Say hello or something,"" he murmurs, voice low, staggering back to stand by Magda. Let the boy be alive. Let both of them be.



What had been a steaming, partially molten pile of armor a few moments ago now looks whole, at least, thanks to Edward and his knowledge. But it gives no immediate answer-- not that piles of slag metal usually start to talk, but this is different-- or it should be different, anyway. And the lack of response is a very bad thing. The cindered remains of the loincloth swirl like black snow on the cooling air around them. The eyes of Al's helmet are deep and dark, with no sign of 'life'... however the definition may be skewed with him in the first place.

Then, a flicker-- ""...B-broth--there...?"" It's nothing but a broken half-whisper. The Blood Array is there, not as pristine as it once was, but not damaged enough for it to be fatal. By some utter, utter miracle.


Those cries pull on her like no tomorrow. Magda feels her insides tearing as if by shrapnel. Slowly, she stands, her body shaky in its tumultuous aftermath, but she remains more than tense. Confusion swallows her expression as she can only watch helplessly, one hand brought up to shield her eyes against the onslaught of light. Rubbing at her lids, she tilts her head, a heavy breath escaping her as, by all appearances, a sea of metallic bits and twisted pieces make whole. She only has half of a clue of what could be going on, and remains as fixed in the darkness as the rest of the ruins. Blue lights and falling figures, though, remain on the back of her mind -- her attention's on Edward as he cries. There are few things that could take her mind away.

Such as an empty suit of armor speaking.

""Fuckinchrist!"" Magda barks out, almost taking a header the third time tonight as she all but scrambles back.


""*Al*!"" Ed's voice is nearly a shriek--no better than Al's at the moment, really. Still shaking, he rises to his feet and flings his arms around his brother. Never mind that Al can't feel it, never mind that it's really terribly awkward. He can't think of anything else to do at the moment.

Finally, though, he releases his hold on his brother and staggers back. He grins. Then he wavers and...collapses. His legs just sort of go out from under him. ""Nnnnh,"" he says. ""I need to sleep. And eat. And, and take a fucking *shower*. And..."" He wobbles some more. ""I'm so glad you're here, Al.""


Hellboy reaches out a hand to steady Magda as she stumbles. ""Hey now,"" he says--completely unphased by talking armor. Hell, he knew what Al was. Why should be surprised that... the armor sounds alike an eleven year old? Whatever. Sigh. Hellboy just grins, and offers Magda what support he can, ""Hey,"" he whispers, even as he watches Ed collapse on the armor-that-is-Al, ""it's a happy ending, babe. How often do you see that?"" Now, he needs to POUND ED, but. He'll do that later, along with a talk about using great power responsibly. 

""C'mon, boys. Let's go home,"" he says, slowly leaving Magda's side to help Ed up. Still, he can't help but look up, search the sky. The alchemy hasn't eaten them. Neither has the infinity effect. This is, oddly enough, too good to be true."

"event","Hellboy takes Ed mermaid hunting. It does not go that well. 

<lj-cut text=""Get some pasties, woman!"">

It's standard, he says to himself. Normal. After all, this is what he did for fifty years on the Other Side. He's taking along the kid to have Ed do SOMEHING that isn't... well... involving burying himself in a book or magazine or science-whatcha-magoogit. So it was that he noted ot the kid that he was going out to do some Special Work that did not involve hard hats (that don't fit) or overalls (ditto). So he came to the docks -- he'd already arranged for a few things to be picked up. Like, a large tank and a pickup truck -- you know, things for transport.

""Ed,"" he finally says, after he meets with the dockman, ""We're gonna hunt us a mermaid today."" Putting up his big, red right hand to forestall any argument, he adds, ""And before you disbelieve, think of who you're talking too.""

And then he heads out down a dock, footfalls heavy on the wood. Clonk. Clonk. Clonk.


The majority of the usual dockworkers are gone for the day, leaving the few who are left to double take at the big red hulking thing coming up their dock, but do no more than that. This is Beacon Harbor, after all. They'd much rather look at the mermaid who's busy catching the last rays of sun, floating on her back with lazy flips of her tail. She's apparently concerned about her eyes, though, as she's wearing a sleek pair of sunglasses.


It's taken some time, no question about that. Edward's been here for over a month, after all. But he's finally gotten himself somewhat accustomed to the prevalence of bizarre, apparently supernatural creatures in this city. How has he done this? He's decided that they're all misfits of science who he will eventually be able to explain according to scientific principles!

So it's with rather more cheer than usual in such situations that Ed follows Hellboy down the dock, although he's still looking somewhat wary and subdued. ""Why are we hunting the mermaid?"" he starts off by asking--and then he stops as he catches sight of the mermaid in question. ""Um. She's wearing sunglasses.""

""Because she's making the docks insurance skyrocket by causing accidents and generally being where she's not to supposed too."" He catches sight of the finned laddy, and smirks slightly. ... ... A man can appreciate, if it's freely displayed, after all. Ahem! Grinning slightly, he adds to Ed's statement, ""I hope that means she's relatively modern and can speak English. I really hate having to go through one hundred odd languages to try and figure out which one she speaks.""

He comes right up to the edge of the docks, and then whistles once. ""Hey, Miss? You, with the fish tail. Can I have a moment of your time?"" Yeah, that's Hellboy. While he's more comfortable playing 'beat the monster', that doesn't mean he doesn't know how to TALK before breaking out the big guns.


X doesn't come closer, but pitches her voice such that the water carries the sound. ""What can I help you with?"" It's a polite, well-modulated voice. Slightly bored, like she's been interrupted at a pile of paper work.


""She's wearing sunglasses,"" Edward repeats, his eyes glazing over visibly, his voice going vague, ""and *nothing else*."" He seems to be forgetting to blink. Hey, look, he *is* interested in girls after all! Sort of. When he can't help it. And no, it doesn't look like he's going to be doing anything useful, such as picking his jaw up off the ground, any time soon.


Sliding his hand over his near-bald head, Hellboy considers. ""Miss, we've had some complaints from the local folks about your... propensity for causing accidents. No fault of your own, I'm sure -- but a naked mermaid tends to get attention that ought to be kept on the job. Now, local decency laws aside -- they're not sure what they can do, other then call in a guy like me. I'd rather not remove you by force, seein' as you're a pretty lady, an' I hate havin' to hit a lady."" He pauses, glancing ot Ed. Put your eyes back in your damn head! Grump. ""Is there any way we can reach a compromise?"" he asks, resting his hands on his knees.


X takes note of Edward's interest and arches her body interestingly, letting the sinuous curve of her back play out gracefully through the arc of her tail. Then Hellboy's words set in. She turns those matte sunglasses at him and just stares for a moment. It's a long, measuring stare. ""You. You want to take me in for being, ah, distracting. Because I'm a metahuman."" There's a note of disbelief in her rich voice.


Edward makes a tiny strangled noise in the back of his throat. Why do his pants suddenly feel tighter? He hasn't gained any weight! He swallows hard and passes a hand nervously over his eyes--only to register the implications of the conversation. ""Wait. Wait, we're going to put her in the tank and--and *then* what?"" he demands of Hellboy. ""Lock her up because she's not wearing a shirt?"" Although funny, he can kind of see why this is a crime, now. ""Are you kidding me?"" Wow, Hellboy, aren't you glad you brought Ed along now?


""I want you to stay clear of where men, women, and children can eyeball you,"" He glances back to Ed--and finally gives in with whacking the boy in the shoulder to bring him out of his hormone induced daze, only to get Ed snarking at him, ""Because apparently they forget themselves and fall off boats and the pier. It's not that I'm callin' the view bad,"" Oh /hell/ no. Hellboy's a hotblooded man, ""I'm calling people stupid. Alas, there are no laws against stupidity. There are laws against naked women in public places, metahuman or not."" He doesn't seem to like it anymore then Ed does. ""You think I like being hired for this kinda work? I'd rather be fighting man-eating beasties and saving babies from Faerie,"" he snaps, as an aside to Ed.

He shrugs then, and stands straight. ""What about it? You want to be transported somewhere? If I can figure out what you need, I'm glad to help."" Not like he isn't being mean here. ""I'm willing to arrange a road trip -- some unfrequented part of the coast, something."" Magdaisgoingtokillhimforbringingamermaidhome. ""You able to survive outta the water long, Miss?""


""I assure you, I am quite mobile."" The shock is being replaced with a rich, warm amusement. ""And I am also fairly certain that I'm not displaying anything more than young women at clubs. You are--"" she pauses and tugs on a piece of cord, pulling up a briefcase. She snaps it open, careful to keep the inside dry, and pulls out what appears to be a PDA. Closing the briefcase and letting it drop again, she glances at the readout, ""--not an officer of the law and thus have no authority over me.""


""Ow!"" Edward yelps at the whack in the shoulder, never mind that it couldn't have hurt that much. He rubs indignantly at it, fixing Hellboy with a sullen look. He's distracted, however, when X takes out that briefcase. He blinks. She's wearing sunglasses, a briefcase, and nothing else. This just keeps getting weirder.

And then she's taking out that PDA. He drops to a crouch on the pier and tries to get a closer look at the device. ""How do you know?"" he demands, only to be distracted by the closer sight of all those weird scales. ""...you, uh. Do you do as well in freshwater as in saltwater? What do mean, mobile? Out of the water too? How?"" Curiosity boy, away!


""You get a set of pasties, babe, and I'll leave you alone forever. On the other hand..."" He grins slightly, and then says, ""I'm not an officer of a law organization of this world, no,"" he says. ""But I still find my work. The 'BPRD' mean anything to you?"" Probably not, but he may as well try. He digs into his pocket, and fishes out his ID, flashing his badge. ""Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, if that helps,"" extending it down to her. But he shrugs slightly, and says, ""As for my authority -- I have all the authority the owner of the docks has given me. This is private property, honey. It's just the cops won't come screw with metas, whereas, I will.""

He pauses and looks at Ed, and then looks down at X, tilting his head. ""Good question -- and shut your mouth, Ed.""


X points to the dock he's standing on, and then to the coast, ""That is private property."" She pats the water. ""This is ocean. And I have never heard of the 'Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense,' but it sounds like the kind of bullshit my colleges make up to get close enough to do investigations. So: You don't look like an agent, but I don't look like an agent. Let me tell you this. Metas are the norm in this hell hole of a dimension. I am not disturbing anyone's sense of reality by existing or sunning myself. If the idiots up there can't help but think with their pants, well, that's hardly my fault."" And pasties? Really... she's got built in pasties.


""You didn't answer any of my questions,"" Edward mumbles, rather weakly; he's busy staring some more at X and her breasts. Wow, he didn't know weird chimera-like creatures could be that sexy! He's feeling an uncomfortable desire for some nice alone time with the hand that's still flesh-and-blood. (His tastes aren't the same as Winry's, thanks.) No, he's not going to be very useful here.


""Colleagues?"" Hellboy arches a brow, then, and cants his head slightly, his rumbling voice low and thoughtful. Agent -- is she like him? Well, more like Abe, but still. ""Well, then you should understand my position, shouldn't you? And you know that even if I'm not registered with any agency you can look up, this is my job. And I'll follow through. I'd really rather come to a peaceful compromise, though, without breakin' out the guns, though. You seem reasonably intelligent -- what's the harm in asking you to move?"" he says -- before he glances back to Ed. ""And you didn't. Why don't you?"" he asks, tilting his head slightly."

<lj-cut text=""Magda calms. Hellboy internally angsts."">

There is no fight to be found in this shell of a woman. Her movements are dulled and mechanical, compliant to Hellboy's gentle guiding, no life there for her to wield as a weapon. Tomorrow, Magda may return to her usual self, the woman who services no fool and takes no shit, but for now the open, paled look on her face will yawn wider than any exit wound, reveal pain so bright it is toxic. But even as she's carefully sat on the couch, tentatively tended to, she doesn't shed a tear. She is calm, but only because her weary face is frozen over.

Her grey eyes lock on somewhere else, a place that could be a million miles from here, but her head tilts because she's listening to him. Only the instant that he touches her, gently swathes her hair away, do Magda's cloudy day eyes return. She always has listened to Hellboy, taken in his words, and despite how little she really knows him, her respect runs deep that she would not dismiss what he has to say.

But even as she listens, she draws back, already shaking her head. ""Share?"" she asks, her voice scratchy with exhaustion, with the emotion she prefers to bottle. ""With what? You? You're right, it -- it's my mistake. I'm not going to unload it on you. It's not why I keep you here. You got -- thrown here... I'm supposed to be taking care of you. I'm gonna be fine, Red,"" she finalizes, all too dismissively, shifting with sudden, painful restlessness. ""Just been a bad night. I'll be normal tomorrow.""


""Magda."" Hellboy says, his voice even but firm. ""You have just had a night that would have me down a day, and not much keeps me down that long. Then, you tell me all this shit -- and you say, you're gonna be fine? Normal? You and fine haven't exactly shaken hands in a long time, Mags, and normal for you is scraping bottom for some."" He lets his arms find his kneels, dangling his hands between them, his worry plain and palpable. But what can he do. You cannot force someone to help themselves -- you can't force someone to do much of anything, really. ""I really don't like to see good people like you suffer like this. Makes me mad. Usually, I beat monsters up when I'm mad, but I'm running slim on 'em.""

Blonde hair. Huge. Claws. Fangs. He'll find /that/ monster, and he'll beat him to death. It'll make him feel better, yes.

""But we will talk this over more. Right now, though, you really need rest."" He pauses, rises, and then says, ""I'm gonna finish makin' up your bed. Please, stay put, Mags."" And then he goes to collect the laundry, troubled and pained. This is not what he was cut out for. Not at all.


Magda frowns wordlessly after Hellboy, her assaulted, mauled body slouched there haphazardly on the couch. She watches him collect the sheets she bloodied and leave her there, her grey eyes pinched after his turned back. She knows, herself, that normal is a dead word, and fine may be a far reach from here, but she doesn't want him to think that. Not him, not Ed, not anyone she's suddenly declared under her charge.

As much as she knows she is a living reminder of a mistake, one that should have taken her instead of the only two lives she ever loved, she wants to do good by the next pair. She wants to see Hellboy safe and sure of this world, and Edward always protected.

She looks down, touching flimsily at her legs, under her knees, clasping the rare patches of skin that don't hurt. Lost in thought, eyes reading the scars peeking out from the elastic waist of her sweats, Magda sadly cannot adhere to Hellboy's command for so long. She's a bundle of nerves, twitchy and frayed, and though it hurts, she gets back up. On her hitched step, and paces slowly back and forth across the living room.


Hellboy comes up from the basement to find her pacing. He stops, ready to protest, and then -- just goes upstairs to finish what he started. It's quick and simple, and kees him from getting upstead too much, watching her move. And then he's back downstairs -- moving i the kitchen, getting into the herbals that he bought at the store.

He does not ask her to sit down again, or to join him. He's simply working at -- something. God knows what.


This is all so new to Magda, having someone around to watch when she feels on the verge of her small, sporadic breakdowns. If she were by herself, it would be different. She'd possibly be further worlds of pain, but different all the same. She would already be passed out, either by blood loss or a finished bottle of alcohol, and she wouldn't have to be thinking her thoughts or worrying her worries, or feeling like if she doesn't get a drink or a smoke, her nerves are going to sharpen and gouge a billion holes out of her skin.

She doesn't join Hellboy in the kitchen, perhaps too shy to, or perhaps knowing herself too well that she'll be craving her scotch all the more. Magda moves until she doesn't feel restless anymore, until it hurts so much that she cannot, and she gently leans herself up against the back of the couch. She stares out the wide window in the living room, her eyes on the darkness outside.


And herbal smell takes to the air; it's there, hot and warm and soothing, and it comes closer, the small mug in Hellboy's over-large rock hand. Carefully cradled there, he comes to her with it -- to simply pass it over. ""It'll help you sleep,"" he explains, and then adds, ""and there's some stuff in there to make it restful and help your healing."" It's not scotch. But at least it'll take it away; however, Hellboy's draught promises peace and healing, not numb oblivion. THere's a slight difference.


""Thanks,"" she rasps emptily, reaching her bandaged hands for the cup. She doesn't drink it, seeming to forget about the tea the moment she takes it up. The cup feels like it weighs a hundred pounds. Just at that moment, the weight of the entire night falls on her shoulders, nearly crippling her on the spot. Magda stares out the window, the distant kitchen light reflecting both hers and Hellboy's images on the glass. She looks at herself, and pretty much realizes she looks and feels like she was hit by a train. But that's not what's really on her mind. ""Red?"" she asks, lowly and uneasily. She pauses a little, but as per usual, the woman's questions are always to the point. ""You're not going to go weird on me, right? I told you my shit -- I don't tell people that. You're not gonna look at me like I'm broken glass, are you?""


""Shit, no,"" Hellboy says, his brows furrowing as he looks down at her, frowning. ""You ain't broken glass -- you're a stained glass window. Lots of color -- but the right light gotta hit you before anybody can see that all those shards makes up a beautiful whole."" He grins, then, and then lays a hand on her shoulder, and says, ""But -- you're gonna have to face facts, Mags. It's not that I know -- it's that I know, and understand, okay?"" At least, he hopes she understands... that he understands. ...Augh, so complicated. His tail lashes once -- just once -- before it settles slightly, curling against his thigh in an effort to keep calm and still; he can't help her if he's agitated."

"event","Magda comes home as so much hamburger. Angst ensues. <lj-cut text=""Hellboy shares half-a-secret"">

 
Her truck takes out the mailbox.

Half off the curb, half into the lawn, the wheels dig up grooves of grass before the engine finally dies out. There is a long, hideous silence, before the driver's door finally unhooks. It cracks open, and falls back closed. It takes a stronger, harsher push to jar it, one that draws the roughest of sounds from the driver. Magda shudders as she inches out of her truck, bit by bit, one savage catch of her weight nearly felling her to her knees. She catches herself, grating out a thick breath, her fingers leaving blood as the come off the handle of the door.

She doesn't know why she's not at the hospital. She doesn't even know how she managed to drive home. All she knows is that she did, just barely, that this is where her half-mindless state wishes to be, and that it hurts so much oh god, please make it stop hurting. Grasping her abdomen like a security blanket, a gesture of a what feels like a million years ago, she sort of remembers Vegas. They were all back in the car, not moving, couldn't move, you need a face to move... but she could move. So she walked, holding herself together, so afraid something would fall out. She couldn't scream, forgot how to, but she could move. And she walked, like she does now, at least until it all goes black.

Her blunt nails scratch flimsily at the handle to the front door.


She doesn't need to get the handle of the door -- it opens for her soon enough. The sound of tires, the clack-clang of a door -- not to mention the crunch of the mailbox. It got attention. Hellboy is there, his large, right hand fisted, the smaller, human one reaching out quickly enough. It's as if he expects attack, repercussion, SOMETHING to follow like Hell on Magda's heels. 

But nothing is there; the silence remains. Crickets sing, even, only to add to the incongruity of it all. So, he grunts once, and then takes Magda's small form up in his hands, till she's a tiny china doll against his broad chest with it's scritchy, wiry black hairs, and marches upstairs. Kid be damned. Magda's going down on her bed /right now/, and he's gonna get that goddamn field kit a heartbeat later.

It's there; clomping hooves over wood and carpet -- Magda is left alone a scant minute before he's up there, with the field kit, his face set as gentle as that cliff-hanging visage can manage. ""Tell me what happened, Mags,"" he says simply, even as the light is turned on, the field kit is opened.


Magda is hamburger. She's more blood than skin -- only half of it hers -- and her clothes are gutter, tattered bits, only clinging to her by the stickiness of open welts. She slumps the moment she feels herself picked up, some conscious part of her letting the woman know, briefly, who this is. Relief turns her into dead weight, slung forward, one arm hooking over his shoulder. She doesn't speak, only breathes shallowly, softly, almost peacefully as she's carted upstairs, unaware of the world at large.

Laid down, she looks like a carving board. Like she's been mauled by a bear. A tiger. Something bigger. Worse. Long, shallow chords of claw marks tic tac toe her arms, her legs, her sides, her stomach, anywhere that would look pleasing to the rabid, vicious flailings of a wild animal. She doesn't let go of her abdomen, her hands gripping together the bloodied, but relatively unharmed flesh of her hollowed stomach, her bleeding fingers buried into the scars there.

She stares off somewhere, only after a long pause she finally realizes Hellboy's spoken to her. Magda's head rolls to face him, jaw marks branding her throat. Her lips part, the flesh stuck dryly together, and after a pregnant pause, she wheezes, ""It got me.""


""I can see that, sweetheart,"" he says quietly, even as he realizes he's gonna need more then this -- out of a belt pouch comes that hematite stone, and he carefully unfolds one hand -- just one! -- and presses the stone into her palm. ""Hold that. It will help you."" And then he's off to get something else. He doesn't have enough fucking bandages for this shit. Still. Hot water. Clean hot water. She'll need new sheets tomorrow, but still. 

He comes back a few moments later, a large bowl in one great hand, and the other reaches for her brow even as he puts it down, to smooth back her ragged hair. ""I'm gonna get you out of these clothes and bandage you up, all right? Just move as I direct you."" Even so, he begins to carefully lift her, help her, turn her, to get those goddamn things off, starting to find wounds, getting the rag and water he's brought up, crushing it in his stone palm, and then carefully cleaning wounds with it. It's tense now, and he asks, as he begins to carefully pick away gummy, bloodied tatters, ""Was it the werewolf?"" He's got to know. Like this -- she'll turn. God, will she turn, with wounds like these... she has to be infected.

It's almost a blessing that she dresses in layers. Her moody leather jacket peels away first, its existence possibly the only reason why she's alive, why the claw marks are more shallow on her body than on her arms and legs. Her shoulder holster's hacked through on one side, and her gun is missing. Beneath that, her blouse is a sticky, gravelly mess -- she was on the ground -- and her black tank top beneath is filmy with blood. She tries to move every so way, her movements odd and choppy, just not all there. Magda shivers as she's slowly undressed, her gesturing cooperative and coldly mechanical. She's not about to get shy about what's going on. It hurts too god damn much to get shy. Her hand fists absently around the hematite stone. ""Wolf?"" she asks at length, grey eyes squinting at something distant. ""No. Wasn't. It -- I don't know.""


""Good, good."" Or perhaps not. He doesn't know what to think of omething that wasn't the werewolf -- but at least she won't be howling at the next full moon. He hopes. He slides his hands over her skin, and he doesn't seem to mind the blood; the right, stone hand, holding it's gentle, warm rag follows after. It's clinical, careful -- but still compassionate. He cares not for the bare skin -- but for the wounds, which have his attention far more then any nakedness does. 

He talks, quietly, keeping her focused as he works, getting the blood up, the wounds clean, her body rid of dirt and wet and blood, before he finally begins to take to wrapping her up, dapping antiseptic on her skin and holding her gently if she winces. ""Looks like you fought with a tiger, woman. What happened?""


How. It. Hurts. Cleaning her wounds feels worse than receiving them, and a permanent cringe edges into her features. She grits her jaw to stifle them, and then turns her face away. It is not shyness, the fact that she feels her body slowly being uncovered that forces Magda's eyes away; she does not want him to see the pained tears at their corners. She watches the plug on the wall as she's slowly tended to, as her body reveals itself as lean and lithe, and completely lacerated. Beneath all the blood, she is as white as a sheet, save for her lower stomach. Its grissly scar tissue has a colour of its own. Her body moves as she breathes deeply, ribcage shifting, the practical muscle flinching beneath her scarred abdomen.

Her hands ball into bloodied bedsheets when he starts with the antiseptic, a reflexive jolt trying to curl her body away. It hurts. A breath shudders out of her, low and agonized, but she soldiers on, ""It was -- something."" Magda pauses then, thoughts escaping her, her crackling voice barely there. ""This guy. He was huge. On this girl -- gun did nothing. Was right on top of me.""


""Give me a description,"" Hellboy says, even as white swallows up the dark, his eyes on the bandaging and the gauze. He finishes a roll, then moves on to an other. ""Big is a start -- how big. Big as me?"" With this sort of strength, possibly. Claws, obviously. These aren't the clean cuts of a knife or a sword -- these are ragged nails. God knows; he's had them himself; he knows what it's liked to be clawed up. But he bets he heals cleaner then Magda does.

Eventually, he's done. And then he does the unthinkable. He invades Magda's drawers, looking to get her into something comfortable. Linens will be next - -after he moves her down to the couch, but first things first; comfortable clothing for the slasher-movie reject.


""Big. As big as you. Maybe bigger,"" she speaks lowly, thickly, her voice an undercurrent of pain. But that does not take away from her harsh description. She has a memory like a vortex, and nothing escapes. Not even imminent death causes a mind like Magda's to blank. She sprawls on the bed, her naked body thin and prone, breathing ever so shallowly. She hears him in her drawers, but makes no movement to oppose that. It hurts to move. It hurts to think. Her eyes stare off somewhere, anywhere but Hellboy, and she speaks around the tips of her teeth. ""Wide. Massive. A -- fucking animal. Hair. Blonde. Teeth. Claws. Like a cat. Jeans. No sleeves on the coat. There's... shit coming outta his head. Metal, something wrong. It was --"" her eyes squint, ""he was -- I don't know why'm ain't dead.""


He'll be dead after I get a hold of him, Hellboy wants to say. He's gonna be so much cat gut for violin strings. But he doesn't say that, either. He merely gets sweat, warm and comfortable, and comes back, to help his broken friend inton them, gently as as he can with one stone hand. Still, he does his best. Once dressed, he takes her up, gently, in his arms, and says, ""I'm gonna take you down stairs -- you rest there, and I'll clean up the best best I can."" At least it's mostly on the sheets - -and the clothes. That'll take some getting outta the carpet. But it doesn't matter. She goes down. He goes back up -- to work and mutter and to nearly take the lamp off the dresser with the lashing of his tail. He's so mad he could crush this man's head with his stone fist here and now.


It's odd how every muscle in her can be so tense, clenched so harshly that her legs shiver, but to hold her now is like trying to handle a limp, uncooperative rag doll. Magda is dead weight, stinging weight, miserable weight that offers only the tiniest of arguments. ""You don't have to,"" she grates out quietly, as though trying to assure Hellboy that his job isn't to clean up after her. Not her house, her life, her stupid inadequacies. But still, she ends up on the couch, her dark mood going inward with each moment that passes. She watches him ascend the stairs for only a moment, then taking her time to look down at her bandaged, reclothed body.

She scrapes her eyes down her torso, over her legs, and back again to follow the spots of blood soaking through the gauze. Her head pounds, she's only really half-aware of what's happening, and she keeps shocking herself now and then, twitching, swearing that thing's still on her, the ghost of those fangs locked on her neck. And the sound of that other woman when that thing knocked her to the ground. Like she was meaningless. Somewhere along all that thinking, through some higher power's mercy, Magda's pulled herself up to her feet. It's nearly impossible, but she does it. While he's upstairs, she begins that same hitching step to the kitchen.


The bed is stripped, the dirty sheets clumped in a corner, and Hellboy swears at the blood, blood and goddamn it, he hates it. His hooves clomp on the floor, his footfalls heavy as he moves into the hall, gets into the closet, finds more linens, lays them out. Cleaner is gotten -- stain removed sprayed. Goddamn it. He wants to beat the ever lovin' SHIT out of whatever laid the hurt on her, and it's -- god he wants to pound something. But then, he's not gotten a lot of pounding in lately, and it was his major release and AUGH.

Must not punch wall. His fist will go through wall. EITHER of them.

Eventually, he stalks back downstairs, armfull of sheets soon to be bleached bone white -- and stops. ""Holy mother of /God/, Magda, do I have to sedate you? You're dumber then I am when injured!"" And then he's stalking into the kitchen, his tail whipping back and forth behind him with obvious power and a desire to release it on someone very, very bad he doesn't have to feel guilty about hurting.


To open a dictionary and look up the definition of the word stubborn, there would be Magda's sneering mug, staring back, her gunsteel eyes just tempting someone to define her otherwise. She's got that same look, or she would, if not for all the bruising. She walks like Frankenstein's monster, like the dead that have arisen, and not even a brutal mauling keeps the woman from the refrigerator. She ignores Hellboy's abrupt presence in the kitchen, or tries to, only slanting him the barest of glances out the corners of her eyes. She breathes harshly, not out of anger, but just winded beneath all this movement. But the pain is nothing, next to nothing -- especially when she retrieves herself a bottle of scotch, hugging onto it like it's going to save her life.


Hellboy pauses -- and when he looks at what she's taken out of the fridge, this is when the battle begins. Dropping the laundry bundle, Hellboy strides over, his large red, right hand reaching for the bottle, and his left reaching for his shoulder. ""You just lost god knows how much blood, and you want to drink? Over my cold corpse, lady."" He doesn't take argument. He's strong enough to wrestle that bottle out of her hands when she's well -- when she's a cripple, it should be even easier. He doesn't want to hurt her -- but he doesn't want her to hurt herself. Mind you, he'd kill for Ed to be here to transmute some restraints, but that's neither here or nor there. Besides, she probably wouldn't appreciate it. He wouldn't even use fuzzy handcuffs.


If looks could kill -- cold corpses wouldn't be so far out of the question. ""Don't wanna drink,"" she spits out dangerously, affecting the look animals get when they're guarding their meals, something of a starving, skinny cur protecting the scrap of meat it dug up out of an alley. ""-- 'm /gonna/ drink."" Magda is not impressed, beginning to step backwards -- her limping plan to escape shot to hell the moment his hand takes her shoulder. She wrinkles her nose, beginning to sneer, but the warning dies on her lips as the scotch gets yanked so easily from her fingers. She is a shell of tension, of frayed nerves and shivering shock, and the woman who is never angry looks almost shivery for an outlet. ""GIVE it!"" She snaps, and those arms strike out, taking a swipe at the alcohol, a crazed move that splits all the lacerations up one side. Magda's attack falls short only because she's flinching with a ragged yelp.


It's like hitting a wall; the bulk of Hellboy does not budge-- would not, even if she threw the fridge at him. But she can't. In fact, it's to the top of the fridge, way to the back, that the scotch goes. And then Hellboy looks down at Magda, his tail still cutting that violent path behind him, swish, swish, swish, and says, ""Now, you listen to me. You are gonna sit on that goddamn couch, and you're gonna wait for me to finish up your bed. Then, you're gonna go lay down and rest. And heal. And you're not going to go to work for a few days, or by god, I'll haul you to the hospital bodily, have them sedate and restrain you, and THEN you'll get better because some white-coated cold /scientist/ is being /paid/ to /make/ you."" 

His voice raises, progressively, like rolling thunder, till it's a boom, rattling the cupboards. ""So make your choice, Magda! You submit and heal, bide your time, or you can fight me now about it and lose. But either way, you're not getting' that scotch right now! So sit down, shut up, and let me finish what I was doing, or so help me, you're goin' back in the truck /right now/!""


The boom rattles the cupboards and briefly closes her eyes. Magda has a harsh poker face, and she's more than able to stare down ten times her weight in sheer gall. But as he storms, as he outlets their tension in a detonation that wakes her neighbors, her displeasure is cold and smooth, like the edge of a knife, one that is seriously contemplating a malicious twist. Eyes like frozen razorblades, scowl like a blade's serrated edge, Magda collects herself from a hand cradling her stinting side, stance opening and shoulders squaring. She cranes her head back to meet Hellboy right in the eye, and she must've looked exactly like this when facing down that monster that did this to her. ""There's no fight,"" she tells him slowly, her voice acidic. ""'Cause this is my house. And this is my life. And you ain't got no fucking charge over neither. OK?""


The tail is a whip -- back, forth, violent -- the only indicator of just how angry he is. That he wants to lash; that he has no outlet other then that shout. That she stays still before it is a powerful thing; it deepens both his respect and frustration. ""I'm not runnin' your life, Magda, and I'd never think to do so, or your home,"" he says pointedly. ""But I do have to step in when you're gonna kill yourself. I'm savin' your life, not dictatin' it. There's a goddamn difference. You may be all right with slow suicide for whatever reason -- but like it or not, I value you, I /care/ about you. And the last thing you need right now is a bottle of Scotch. All you need is blood thinner when you've damn near bled out to begin with!""


The blood, the bandages, the burned memories of that thing mauling her do not matter. What does is Magda's apparent loss of control, something that seemed to happen the instant the monster touched her. And now she marinates in it, hotly, venomously, the poison of anger replacing the poison of alcohol that she cannot imbibe right now. She is not many things that she wished she could be, stronger, stable, a wife, a mother, a good woman, but she does her damndest to stay in control. She is not Hellboy's responsibility. She is no one's responsibility. He is /hers/, and he is going to back down, God be her wincing, eye-shielding witness. ""You wanna talk about dying?"" she asks slowly of him, a rattle beginning to affect her voice. ""I had. That thing's teeth on my neck. It -- was gonna rip off my throat. I should be DEAD RIGHT NOW!"" she barks without warning, her voice like a door slamming, one finger stabbed at him. There's blood beneath the nail. ""I shoulda been dead YEARS ago! A LONG fucking time ago! But I'm NOT! So I'm gonna fucking have a DRINK!""


- - Should be dead.

She just said. She should. Be dead. And he's seen the scars, and watched the drinking, and his intuition puts up so many red flags, redder then his own skin, redder then the blood all over her hands, still under her nails, soaking through the gauze. And he just looks at her, his lips parting, but no sound coming out, and it sinks in. She really doesn't care. There's no value to his life. He, he who has been told that his life threatens everything he loves, every person he's ever come in contact with -- and she holds herself no better then a corpse.

He moves -- sudden, reaching out to lock her up in his arms; she can kick and scream, she can rage and weep, but he's going to get her, going to hold her, going to take her up in his arms again, and haul her off.


""Don't you dare --"" she starts to hiss, her voice as empty as the threat it carries. Magda sees those arms swoop in, and she steps back, but he's too big and she's too small, and her effort would be called valiant if it weren't so laughable. ""Put me DOWN!"" she snarls, her voice a whuff of air, anger clenching her voice, vicing her heart, making it for a moment impossible to breathe. ""Hear me?! Sonuva fuckin' bitch!"" She shudders viciously, unused to handling her emotions, unused to emotion altogether, unused to someone caring whether or not she's bleeding or boozing.

Her arms shoot out, hands digging into the meat of one of Hellboy's massive shoulders, and she fights him. It isn't the practiced, precise strikes of a police officer, but just one human being flailing, struggling because it's easier to do that than deal with this. She does rage, shoving at him until it hurts, and when it does, Magda sags. She breathes out sharply, windedly, a mistake, because her voice catches and breaks into a sob. Her hands are still there, gripping down, but not in fury. She was never really angry, and not at him, or even the rest of the world. She's tired, she's confused, and she hurts.


Hellboy doesn't carry her in his arms, or even over his shoulder; no, he carefully wraps both arms about her waist and makes sure she can kick and gouge and flail till it comes out of her. And he walks her, with purpose, toward the bathroom, and quietly, and sets her down, gently enough, once the fights gone out of her before the mirror. 

""I have no idea what you see when you look in the glass,"" he says, his voice low, leaning over so he can stop himself from raising his voice, keep it on that low, rumbling thunder, his lips moving slowly, white teeth stark when he carefully enunciates. ""But I'm seein' a woman who's worked to the bone, and then cut to the quick but somethin' else. Your scars aren't any of my business -- but you keep openin' up and bleedin', Magda, and I don't want to stay here and watch you die in slow motion. I said it before -- whatever it is eating you up, you gotta get it out. It doesn't have to be to me; I'd listen if you wanted... But I can't watch and be silent anymore. I'm sworn to protect and serve -- it might not be the same oaths you took when you got your badge, but I'm still held to 'em, even if it's just a memory of another world. I'll protect you from yourself, Magda -- but in the end, I can only do so much.""

He pauses quietly; his arms unfold, come down to the counter, there, a circle around her, big ape-limbs a cage. ""Dying isn't easy. Even quick. Died before -- once; just once. It's pretty shitty. I made choices, then -- hard ones -- about living again. It would have been easy -- maybe even better, in some ways -- to go into the dark, and let everybody move on without me there. But in the end -- I wanted to live. There is too much beauty and good for me to fight for here."" He shakes his head, eyes hooding briefly, only to half-open, burning with a dull, half-hearted flame. ""Yeah, I stick my head in the sand for a lot of it. But I'm still livin', Magda. It's a good fight -- better then just laying down and lettin' it steam roll me."" He pauses, and then asks, pointedly, ""What's drivin' you down, Magda? Tell me. I'm not going to judge you -- I might not even be helpful. But at least you'll lay it out -- and I don't care if you tell me that you slipped up, or you failed, or you lost or you won and it was for all the wrong reasons. But -- if you can, tell me. What's got you so bad that you can't shake it?"" His eyes then light slightly, as if the flame within them were fanned, and he says, without flinching, ""You're strong-- stronger then me, I bet, in the ways that count. So what has you running, Magda? What has you diving into the bottle so bad you don't wanna come out?""


There is some idea of what she sees. The moment her eyes turn on that mirror, Magda twitches like her image bit her. She has not seen herself in a long time, at least not tonight, not since she was mauled beneaeth Sabretooth's furious claws. The sight of herself drains the blood out of her face, and all the woman can do is stare at herself, repulsed but at the same time, unable to look away. She watches the cuts on her face, the bruising along her hairline, the teeth marks burned into her throat, and the tears on her cheeks, listening to Hellboy speak.

Then his arms come down, trapping her on either sides, and it makes her look up at him. Magda does not turn around, look over her shoulder, merely slant her eyes up on his massive reflection, watching his face show up on the mirror. Her hands come up, hooking her fingertips on the lip of the counter, her blunt nails scraping tonelessly against the marble. She needs to twitch. She needs to do something, small tiny gesture, if just because the rest of her hurts too much that she cannot. She doesn't have the will or the energy to try to escape this, though every reflex, every instinct tells her to. She doesn't want to be here. She doesn't want him to see her like this. She doesn't want to see herself like this. She doesn't want to listen. She doesn't want to talk. She doesn't want to tell him about her life. She especially does not want to -- shudder just like that, Hellboy's last sentence exorcising the fight out of her like a punch to the gut.

She leans her hips against the counter, almost hunching forward, breathing thickly against the countless burns of her wounds. Only they serve to remind her that this is really happening. She lets her eyes drop, falling on her hands, squinting at them, then turning even lower to return home on the bandages wrapped around her hollow belly.

She does not move for a long time, not until the strain that shivers up her arms. She realizes she's gripping the sink so hard that it hurts. ""I lied,"" she forces out, her voice not slow, not hitched, not tremulant. No drama there. She speaks coldly and bitterly, a voice like a hypothermic drunk. ""I told you I never -- I didn't murder nothing. That was a lie. I killed my baby.""


He watches with the eyes of the investigator -- he can't help it; they hood, they watch, they take in. Yeah, it's like watching the final throes of agony before a possession is tossed off, and at the same time, it's not. It's her. All her. His psychological training sure as hell didn't prep him for /this/, and he wishes he'd listened a little closer in his lessons in dealing with certain disabilities, certain mental states -- he's never been that good at dealing with the aftermath. But if he's got to live with it, he better damn learn to cope.

Or help her learn to, anyway.

""How?"" he asks, his voice low, subsonic, felt more then heard, even as his hands finally leave the lightest touch they can manage; gliding over her shoulders, careful of his grip there. He's had to learn to touch like everything is glass -- when he could crush her bones like a bird's in his hands, it's a hard thing -- but he has to be gentle here. Guide her away from that mirror -- don't have it looking back at her now that she's exorcising that ghost. Get it out -- see it from the inside, not the out.


The woman moves beneath his guiding hands, pliant only because she's just so exhausted. She has no fight left in her, not tonight. She's as good as a domino, waiting expectantly to be pushed over. She can stare Hellboy down when he's angry and his voice is calling all sorts of wicked echoes off the walls, but she can't stand to look at anything now, her half-hooded eyes arched towards something that cannot stare back. She swallows against the fang marks on her throat, her voice thick and heavy, as though the vice is still there, a wild animal strangling her to death. ""Vegas,"" she breathes out bitterly, gritting her teeth when she's not speaking.

""I was getting married. I was a month from having my girl. And I made an arrest. I knew the mob coulda bit me, I knew it, and they did. They put a hit on me, and everything's gone."" Her voice is so dead. So final. Like it's nothing to cry over. Like you just can't cry over what's happened. It doesn't fix anything. Magda lifts a hand to paw back her hair, and it's shaking. She lowers it again to touch her bandaged side.

""They shot Danny, shot out my girl. They took my bullet. I should be dead. If there was a God, Red, he'd of ended me.""


It's a strange, terrible thing. To hear her say that, and remember that he once thought hat of himself. But he listens. ""We all have to do what we have to do, Magda,"" he says, exonerating her of her job in one sentence. It was what she did -- just sa what he does is what he /does/, day after day, moving him from place to place, fracas to fracas. But he doesn't say more then that, not until he's got her steered to the couch, nudged gently, her pliancy used to it's utmost. Steer, nudge, prod, seat.

But then he's down on his haunches before her, his eyes alight with worry, with frustration, with so much -- he, once you know him, has an expressive face in small subtle shifts. 

""Once,"" he says, ""I found out something terrible about myself -- and I sought guidance where I could; a priest friend of mine and I discussed what had happened -- and I asked him, if cutting away what ...offended me would solve the problem. And he said that wouldn't do it. 'It is your burden, my son', he said, and I never felt heavier, leaving his home."" He pauses, quietly, and reaches up to tuck a stray curl back, his voice failing him. ""God didn't end you, Magda -- but you're ending you, little by little. Now, at least I know why."" He considers quietly. ""It's your burden, Magda. But -- I have found sharing it a little -- just a little -- makes it bearable, sometime."""

<lj-cut text=""Ed's kitten gets an important name."">

As far as Magda and Hellboy know, there hasn't really been much for Edward to do lately. But he's been out of the house quite frequently, roaming the streets--a practice which no doubt makes Magda nervous as all hell. He does, at least, *usually* come back to the peaceful little house before dark.

Today, though, he barely makes it. The beautiful spring day has faded into a sticky summer evening by the time Ed unlocks the door and steps inside. It's the sort of weather that makes him glad he gave up on the coat for the time being and transmuted this awkward one-armed shirt for himself. (Although, inexplicably, he's still wearing leather pants. Go figure.) Even so, his bangs are plastered to his face with sweat and gathered humidity, and he looks vaguely irritated as he stomps inside. ""It gets way too hot and humid at night here,"" he complains around the stack of books, papers, and journals in his arms. No, he hasn't checked if there's anyone around to hear him; he's just complaining on principle. ""And there's nothing to eat."" As if he was expecting food to fall from the sky into his open mouth. ""I'm hungry!""


""You whine that much on your own world?"" Hellboy asks, his voice drifting out from the kitchen. ""But, I guess I can't complain. At least you eat."" He's there, heating milk in a bottle, a shoebox on the counter, quiet as can be. He sets the bottle on the counter, before he opens up the fridge, and gets out a plate of sandwiches. ""THere. To tide you over till dinner proper, munchkin."" ... Yeah, it's one half a short joke, one half an appetite joke. Course, if Ed doesn't know what a 'munchkin' is, he may not get that this is the time for him to yell and stomp his feet.


Edward's gaze snaps up as Hellboy speaks, and he turns to peer into the kitchen. Scowling, he makes his way in there. ""I don't *whine*,"" he insists. ""I just state the facts, and the facts are that the weather here sucks."" He slaps the stack of books and notes down on the counter next to the shoebox, not bothering to actually look in the shoebox. No, he's got more important things to do! Like start scarfing down the sandwiches. He hasn't even sat down yet.

Only when he's finished with the first sandwich does he bother to register the oddness of the situation and of that curious appellation. ""What's a munchkin, anyway? And what's going on--"" His eyes widen. ""Why are you heating up *milk*?!"" he demands indignantly.


""A munchkin is a magical being in Frank Baum's 'Oz' books, which are you... well, a bit old to be reading. They're magic people, though."" Magic little people, Hellboy doesn't say, but hey. He doesn't need Ed screaming and flailing with a mouthful of sandwich, now does he? But he then puts the bottle on the table, and picks up the shoebox, dropping down into a seat. ""As for the milk,"" he explains, ""I found some kittens the other day, and their mother -- poor Mama Cat was dead, and I... well, I really like cats. So I brought them home. Magda and I have named one each, and since we're aging to keep them, we figured you could name the last one.""

He tilts the box a little, and inside, now mewling since they were jostled by the movement, are three kittens -- one black, a runtish one that's colored ash gray, and a blue-gray tortie patterned one. ""The black one is Broom, and the little gray one is Friday. So you get to name that one,"" he says, pointing to the blue-smoke tortie, and then adds, ""She's the only little girl of the bunch.""


""Magic,"" Edward scoffs, with all the confidence and skepticism of someone who's only been in Beacon Harbor a few weeks. Never mind that he's talking to a big red Antichrist. Surely science can explain that somehow! Also the vampires and angels and dragons and demons and argh not thinking about that right now.

He's halfway through his next sandwich when the subject of *kittens* sinks in. He blinks. ""Um,"" he says weakly, around his food. He finishes his current bite, then stares at the box. His eyes get very big and bright.


""Don't knock it, kid -- in fact, some people would consider your alchemy, rules and all, magical..."" And then he notices the... oh dear. Did he do something wrong? Hellboy stops -- he was just reaching to take up the little gray kitten, the runt, and he just /pauses/, his eyes tracking to the big, bright-eyes of Ed and he begins to worry. ""Ed?"" he asks, his tone gentling. ""Is... there something wrong?""


Edward just...ignores that bit about the alchemy. Not thinking about that! Lalalalalala! It's *not* magic and in fact magic doesn't exist, it's just a big joke! Yes. That's it. It's quite easy for him to ignore, even more so than usual, because he's rather distracted by the kittens. On the other hand, this is not actually a good thing. ""N-nothing. At all,"" he stammers. ""I'm fine! I just--"" He hurriedly wipes at his eyes. He wasn't going to cry! You can't prove a thing! ""My brother likes kittens,"" he finally mutters. ""The last time I saw him, he really wanted to keep one. I told him no, because the way we live, all the traveling we do, we can't afford to raise a cat. But...""


Hellboy thinks on this quietly -- he doesn't know what it's like to lose a brother, not at all. But -- he does know what it's like to feel like you've disappointed someone who you don't see anymore -- and may not see again. So he settles the little gray kitten back into the shoebox, on the scrap of towel within, and picks up the blue tortie kitten. Rising from his chair, he walks up and over to Ed, reaching out with his stone hand to try and coax the boy into taking the kitten. ""Go on. She's yours. Magda and I bother named ours -- we named 'em after important things, too. Broom's for my dad, and Friday's named for the best detective ever. So you better name your kitten somethin' important, to you and your brother, since she'll be his too, once he gets here.""

He speaks resolutely-- as if there's no question that this Al will come here after Ed. And perhaps he really believes that. Perhaps he doesn't, but simply speaks to reassure Ed. It's hard to tell.


Edward stares at the kitten. Stares some more. Finally, he sets his sandwich down (gasp!) and reaches out to very, very gingerly take the kitten in his left hand. As if he's afraid that his mere touch will crush her, even from the human hand. ""Al will love her,"" he says, after a while. He smiles, so very tentatively. ""She'll love him, too. Won't you, Nina?""


Hellboy extends the warmed bottle. ""Now, she can't see you yet -- her eyes are still closed, won't be open for another week. Then it's gonna get messy. Gotta teach 'em about litter, and start 'em on kitten food..."" he explains the simplicity of kitten raising in even, gentle tones, hoping the kid stays calm and can handle the kitten without ...well, yeah, being unstable and lost and teenaged, all at the asme time. He wonders, idly, how he ever survived being a teenager -- but grimly realizes he never got to be one. Even Ed's had that much more then he has.

""Now, here."" he holds the bottle just so, and guides the Fullmetal Alchemist into the proper way to hold it so it won't oveflow the kitten's mouth. ""She'll let you know when she's too full to eat anymore, so don't worry. Just let her set the pace.""


Edward stares down at the tiny, tiny kitten in fascination. ""They shouldn't have to be separated from their mother so little,"" he says mournfully, and it's only because he doesn't realize how sad he sounds that he doesn't stuff it all away. Yeah, he's still pretty unstable and lost and teenaged (the former two being encompassed pretty well by the third), but at least he's not freaking out. ""Um. Okay,"" he says, bemusedly taking the bottle as he's shown how. ""I guess she's kind of cute,"" he adds, managing to recover a bored, indifferent tone, ""even if she does look like a drowned rat.""


""No,"" Hellboy says, his voice even. ""Probably not. But she was dead. There wasn't anything anybody could do, but bury her and hope to take care of her kittens for her, since she couldn't. After all, she died trying to keep them warm and safe."" So wouldn't that be the important part? To him, it is. ""Never had a mother, myself. Lots of Dad, but -- no mom, really."" He shrugs a little, and forgets about it. He doesn't know Ed's issues -- he's just setting about making more milk up -- there are still two hungry kittens, after all, and he did get two bottles. The two kittens mewl pitifully for a little while, before lapsing into sleep. But that's basically what babies /do/; eat, sleep, shit. It's pretty routine.


Edward's eyes narrow as Hellboy speaks of parents. His hand tightens on the bottle, and for a moment it looks perilously close to breaking under the pressure of the metal. Then the kitten turns her head away and mewls in frustration. Slow down, she can't drink the milk if you're giving her that much of it! Ed blinks a few times, then hurriedly eases up his grip and gets Nina-kitten drinking the milk again.

Finally, though, she's had enough, and he gingerly brings the tiny puddle of sleeping cuteness back to the shoebox. ""I dunno *what* they see in this stuff,"" he declares, shaking his head at the bottle of milk.


Hellboy doesn't say anything; if he saw the reaction, he doesn't make any note of it outwardly. He merely gose about making his second bottle, and gets up that little gray fluffball they named Friday. He coaxes him into taking up the rubbery nipple, and she begins to consume it with gusto. 

After a moment's pause, Hellboy replies to Ed's rhetorical snark, ""Milk passes on enzymes and proteins, so on and so forth, bolsters the immune system, helps build strong bones, etcetera."" He grins slightly. ""And your bones determine your height, and therefore, milk makes you taller."" It's said with love. And sheer malice, too, but mostly love.


""Yeah, yeah, I know all that,"" Edward says boredly as he gently places the Nina-kitten down in the shoebox. ""It's still really gross. I mean, think about--"" And that's about when he processes that last bit. ""Hey! Who's so short he'd have to climb to reach the top of a glass?!""


Hellboy smiles broadly as Ed finally catches on, and says, with relish, ""Sometimes we must endure things we don't like for ends we desire. I'm sure you're no stranger to that, Ed."" He doesn't point out the arm, or the leg, or the scars, or the heavy weight on Ed's shoulders. But then he segues gently, into a different subject. ""Like, I travel all over the world all my life, and now, Magda wants to clear out the loft and make it into a space for me up there. And I can see why -- but Ed, this is her house and we're both sort of -- well, stumbled into it. I'm fine with the couch and the floor, and right now, you're in her room."" His tone remains light enough -- for all that he's heavy voiced by nature -- and he adds, ""I think there could be compromise, though -- if that loft is that big, we could easily split it up between us -- your abilities could make a divide, if you wanted, couldn't you?""


Edward just scowls. ""I don't need to drink milk! I'll grow just fine without it! I'm only fifteen! I've still got lots of growing to do..."" He trails off as Hellboy switches subjects, mercifully. His scowl lessens to a gentler frown. ""I don't want to take up her bed forever,"" he agrees, scruffing absently at the back of his neck. ""It's not fair. And I want to get a job, too, so I can help her pay for all this..."" He quiets and listens for a moment, then nods. ""Yeah. I could do that, no problem.""


Hellboy nods, then. ""She's got a lot of stuff up there, not sure where we can put it."" Or really, if they should start moving it without her. ""Still, we'll go along with it and then, we'll work on the rest."" He pauses, and then considers. ""Or, if you wanted -- I wonder if we could get the materials for you to put on an extra room in the house. But that'd probably cause more wiring issues..."" Not to mention foundation issues, and other things. Ah well. ""Still, the loft's a good idea, isn't it?"" 

Plan: Circumvent Magda's Queendom, now in place. He's not going to let her sleep on the couch in her own house while they're there!


Edward perks at this suggestion--then hesitates and looks away. ""I don't know if I could,"" he says quietly. ""I...haven't been able to transmute as much here as I could, in my world. It's...I don't know why. Maybe it's a result of the Infinity Effect, somehow. Dammit, I'm going to change that thing,"" he adds, eyes narrowing with determination though his voice remains low. ""And I'm going to make it--""

He cuts off, hurriedly, shaking his head. ""Never mind about that right now. Yeah, the loft's a great idea. I don't want to take up her bed for much longer.""


You know, that blocky face is not very expressive, but it's still very obvious when he lifts both brows. ""What are you going to do to the Infinity Affect, Ed?"" it's a straight forward question, and by the way he takes the bottle from Friday's mouth, it's pretty obvious that it's an important question, too, and deserves a straight forward (and important) answer.


Oops? Edward tilts his head back to stare up at Hellboy, all wide-eyed and innocent. ""Well, I've been researching it,"" he explains earnestly. ""People have tried all sorts of things--but nobody's ever tried anything like my world's alchemy on it. There's no reason it wouldn't work--the trick is getting a fix on its physical properties, and I'm getting closer to that every day.""

""Then I'm going to transmute it.""


Wow. We went from eyebrows up to mouth open. Hellboy is shocked. Enough that it's visible on his FACE even! That takes /doing/. I mean, really trying /hard/. 

""Uh."" is his oh so intelligent response. But then he sits back, and just shuts his mouth and thinks on it. ""What do you think you can do? I mean -- really. How do you transmute that sort of thing. It's not an object, it's not.. a definable... thing. Is it? I mean, it seems like a strange flux effect, a side affect..."" MAybe /he/ should have researched it when he got here, if this can be done...


But Ed's shaking his head fiercely, and he even goes so far as to start pacing restlessly about the kitchen. ""Something has to be causing it, though. It has physical manifestations--the blue light, the ozone. There's *something* there. I've been studying it, and I should be able to pin it down enough to try alchemy soon enough."" He stops, then, and turns to face Hellboy, golden eyes fierce with determination. ""And I will bring my brother here, and find a way to fix him.""


Hellboy uhs softly, again, and then sighs, letting his left hand find the shoebox full of kitten, and then asks, rather, ""Why don't you go /home/, Ed, rather then bring Al here?"" It's just curiosity -- after all, he's not sure how /he'd/ feel about the opportunity to go home. Certainly, he's a hero there, he's well known, he's got a wad of cash, friends and people he considers family. But there are things he wanted to leave behind, too. And this was a not very convenient way to do it... but still. It has it's perks.


There's a moment of hesitation as Edward stares at the floor. Still not lifting his gaze, he says quietly, ""There's nothing for us there. We have no home, only the military. And..."" Now he does look up, tilting his head back to meet Hellboy's gaze, eyes bright with hope. ""This world is different. The rules aren't the same. So many things are possible here--I bet I'd have a real chance of finding a way to restore my brother's body. Much more than I had back home.""


""You have no family, no friends at all? No one who'll miss you or care about you?"" Come on, there's got to be someone. No child makes it this far alone -- no children, not even two! He doesn't believe it. Hellboy is obviously concerned, his eyes half-lidded and his frown there, apparently on his square face. ""Because -- If that's true..."" He considers. ""I just don't want you to make a decision you'll regret, Ed."" Regrets are heavy things, and Ed has enough weighing him down already. He's short for a reason, after all.


""We had friends, I guess,"" Edward says without much enthusiasm, a faint frown on his face. ""A few people who might miss us for a while. But..."" He shakes his head. ""You don't understand. If I can find a way to transmute the Infinity Effect, I can bring Al here long enough to fix him, and then I can make it send us both back. And we can go home. Finally."" He all but beams.


Hellboy seems mixed in his feelings here, considering the ... weight of Ed's words. ""But you said,"" he reminds Ed, ""That your alchemy wasn't the same as it had been. It's not working as well as it used too. Are you sure you can... manipulate the Infinity Affect? I mean -- that's not even anything you can get ahold of, and it's something that occurs /randomly/. It's... a very risky venture."" He doesn't want to quash the kids' hopes, but still, the voice of reason is definitely needed here. Hellboy runs his fingers down the back of one kitten, trying to soothe himself as much as he's attempting to just enjoy the feel of cat under his hand.


Edward's eyes narrow, the almost insanely cheerful smile flattening out into burning determination. ""That's why I'm studying it. Learning everything I can before I try to mess with it."" He grabs the stack of books and journals from where he set it down. ""But I *will* find out what I need to know."" And he starts to stalk away. At least, as best as he's able to with all that weight in his arms.


Hellboy frowns, as Ed leaves -- he cannot help but worry. Still, his tail twitching and his hand full of kitten, he has nothing more he can do or say, beyond take up Friday again and get the fussy thing to finish his bottle, ""This,"" he says to the kitten, ""Does not bode well."" But what can he do? Ed's powers are far beyond his influence -- and Magda? What would /she/ do? 

Take responsibility. Like she always does. But with that in mid, he calls after Ed, ""Hey, kid? Keep that infinity affect under your hat -- between you and me. I'll ... see what I can find out, myself, about it, all right?""

Hopefully, that'll be enough.


Already on his way off to study, Ed pauses, hesitates, and then turns for a moment to offer Hellboy one of those slow, hopeful smiles. ""Yeah. I'll do that. And, um."" He scuffs a foot along the floor. ""Thanks. For helping out.""

Then it's time to turn and head away again. He has studying to do, you know."

"event","Hellboy fails in his mission to get Magda to eat, but at least takes defeat well.

<lj-cut text=""And maybe, just a hint of flirting occurs..."">


The tail twitches, back and forth, back and forth, a merry little timer to his mood. Yes, EAT THE PANCAKES was a hint. And then he grins, wiggles the fork, and says, ""Yes, yes I am. EAt, you bird boned woman, lest I sit on you and forcefeed you. Metabolism is one thing, but you drink like a fish and never pad your booze with food. So. I am standing here till you give in and you finish your meal for a change, mmm?"" Someone has gotten tired of watching Magda subsist on air and lager. So, here he is. Food in hand. Grinning so wide you can actually see the white teeth beyond the red lips.


Magda just stares at him. She can't help it. She can't believe he's actually serious, and he's standing there, and he's holding her plate, and -- this is really happening. This has never happened to her before, not even close, not an inkling of a caretaker trying to beseech her well-being. She'd sooner know how to react to a bullet wound than this. She makes a sound in her throat, something like a cluck, choosing to find this unrelentingly funny. If it isn't funny, she doesn't know what it is. She puts down her lager, claps her hands in her lap, and stares at him some more. Then she exhales again, smiling ever so rarely, and rolls her eyes as she attempts to find a way around his mass, seeking to hop down from the counter if she can.


He's lost. He knows it once her hands go into her lap, and he groans for it. Rolling his eyes, he steps aside, and sets down the plate and fork. ""More for Ed, I guess. Eats like a vacuum -- makes up for you, I guess,"" he says, shaking his head. What a horrid woman! Any other woman would die for a man to feed them! And this one? Feh! Ah well; that's half the reason he's here -- she's NOT like other women, and that at least keeps him on his toes. He shakes his head, laughing to, and just admits defeat.


""You'll wanna give him a head start on the kitten,"" she muses, all too amused, getting so much damn fun out of this that it shows clearly on her face. Magda's got dimples when she smiles, and she's smiling right now, as warmly as a mug of hot chocolate. She knows her victories well. The woman returns as she gallantly goes back for her lager, and she does something unusual on the way. She brushes in close to playfully bump his side with hers. She touches so rarely, and coming out of her, it's more than the simple display of chumminess it would appear. He made her laugh. She appreciates it.


Taken slightly by surprise with the gentle hipcheck, Hellboy shifts slightly-- not from force, but out of simple flow with the motion. But he glances back over his shoulder, chuckling, and takes a light tail-swipe at the small of her back, a little push in return. ""You're the damnest woman I ever met,"" he says. ""Only Stacie beats you out in sheer bollocks, and I think you could give her a run for her money."" But all the same, he's putting away the food, cleaning up after everything, shaking his head quietly, his laughter still there, intermittent and rich.


Her reflexes are sharp; Magda might not have snatched flies from the air, but she's had to go for her gun -- and fast -- in bad situations more often than not. For such a stoic, moody woman, she's a playful, very gentle drunk, one that snaps back a hand to catch his tail when she feels it on her back. Smiling crookedly over her shoulder, she gives it a squeeze -- not hard, but just to say: gotcha. Letting him go, she starts to linger off, mumbling affably, ""Yeah yeah yeah. I'll contest that. Lemme just drop my balls and put on my man pants.""


Hellboy groans lowly. ""Great. Man pants. And who made commentary about how my gun unmanned their gun? Let's see... you?"" But all the same, he's wandering out to the living room -- he's ready to crash out. It is getting on toward late, and he is getting on toward worn. Tail twitching from that grab, he wanders into the living room to find the shoebox of kittens; they sleep soundly, all in a heap. He sits down, simply to watch them.


Ghosting after him still, she stops at the doorway between kitchen and living room, leaning there like she's part of the decor. She watches him and the kittens, the look on her face all but disarmed from her alcohol. She breathes out and pushes away, disappearing to trade her nearly-finished bottle for her cigarettes. Magda's not ready for sleep herself, and her brain's too muggy for paperwork; while he sleeps, she's going outside for a smoke. She shoulders on her coat as she speaks absently, ""Hey. I figured a name. Just came to me now. For the cat.""


Hellboy scoots back from the kittens, setting up his space to sleep with familiar ritual, before he lays on his back, his and closes his eyes. However, he's still listening in the dark. ""Yeah? What's that, Mags?"" he smirks, his tail curling up, flicking a little, and then laying back down, half out from beneath his blanket.


""The one you picked was important to you, so I'll run with the theme. Most important thing to me is the work. Being a cop, y'know,"" she talks freely, only this freely with a couple beers in her. Magda bends to yank her shoes on, cigarette now dangling from her mumbling lips. ""So Ed II gets to be nicknamed Friday. He gets a name,"" the front door gets pulled open, the rain now spilling out of the cloudy day, ""then it's gonna be after the greatest cop of them all.""


Hellboy ponders this, only for a moment, before he gives a small sound of satisfaction. ""Broom and Friday,"" he says slowly. ""I wonder what Ed will name his,"" he says slowly-- wondering, what's important for a library-obsessed alchemist? ...He'll have to see, whatever way it goes. But then he goes quiet, considering it all, murmuring only, briefly, ""....Broom and Friday."""

"event","In which Magda finally comes homes to the kittens, and Hellboy makes a concerted effort to help her -- both with the cats and other problems. Like her lack of eating.

<lj-cut text=""Ed II, otherwise Known a Friday."">

Magda didn't come home last night.

Even as the blinding rains soon stopped, she was gone. And morning rose to be smothered by clouds, the skies piling up like a bad lasagna, daybreak was hard and moody to take the place of one woman who had not shown up. She does not return until late evening, the few rusty hours before night, when the sunset would be at its most glorious, but not tonight.

Only clouds, so heavy she could feel them, like hands on her shoulders. A hot breeze messes with her hair, and Magda squints at the sky. She likes it best when it's overcast, but today it gives him a headache, just a little one, like somebody pressing a thumb hard between her eyebrows. Her movements deceptively, purposefully quiet, she exhales as she enters her house.

The watery half-light of an evening makes everything inside look soft and hazy, and her tired eyes prefer that.

The woman closes the door to keep the weather outside, because she doesn't need it. She's the house's own cloudy day, her clothes and movement as pale and dulled as her face is, expression heavy, dusky, but done raining.


Mew. Mew. Mew.

It's a chorus --a greek tragedy, all three voices speaking of misery and loss in one plaintive string of calls for their long-dead mother. But there's a clop, clop, clop and there's a warm scent of milk, and there's Hellboy's rumbling bass voice, all soft and settling, as he comes out of the kitchen with bottle in left hand and three kittens cradled in his right. But he stops short of the couch, looking over it at his hazy-night roommate-nee-landlady. ""Hey,"" he says simply, and then sits on the couch, taking up the bottle, letting the first, greedy mouth find the nipple to suckle. It's then that he sets to rumbling himself, some rumbling humming rolling through his chest, up through his thick throat, and offering the kittens a warm, familiar thing -- his scratchy haired chest, now reminding them of their mother.

The woman looks up at the first sounds to greet her, a strange, wondering look suddenly evicting every trace of dullness from her face. As temperate as her mood likes to get, it never gets to stay that way long. She doesn't divert her eyes even as she shoulders out of her coat. She hardly ever hangs it up; just tosses it in a pile of worn leather at her feet. Soon enough, she steps closer, rounding the corner from the foyer to the living room, appearing there the moment Hellboy arrives. She stands there unsure, looking like a stranger in her own home, the confusion deepening the lines in her face as she watches him...pretty much mother a handful of kittens. ""Hey..."" Magda replies, the question evident in her voice.

""It's temporary,"" he says, his voice octaves deeper for his rumbling -- it's definitely more like the voice is felt rather then heard, thrumming through the skin to the bones and echoing through them. ""Found 'em last night on the way home, Momma-cat all dead. So I brought 'em back. Got a baby bottle today, fed 'em with an eyedropper yesterday."" He shifts a little, tiny paws at his chest, trying to climb at the noise, mewling helplessly. They're the picture of weakness, and he treats them as much -- overgentle, with tenderness and affection. ""I like cats, I like 'em a lot. Just... couldn't leave 'em to freeze in the rain...""


Magda can't help but stare. It's possibly the last thing she'd ever think of seeing, and if one year ago, someone told her she'd one day come home to a seven-foot red guy nursing three baby kittens, she'd have the guy drunk tanked. But there it is, that odd sight, and it makes the woman wonder about herself when she's warmed by it instead of anything else. On the surface, she shakes her head and paws back her hair, casting the same hand in a dismissive, understanding gesture. She gets it. She gets it real well. ""Naa, they came to the right place,"" she says as she disappears into the kitchen. ""Magda's house of strays.""


""Heh. We'll get 'em homes,"" he says simply. Can't expect Magda to take in two men, three cats -- what next, a baby? C'mon, let's not push Karma's buttons here -- otherwise things they don't want may come slurping their way to the door, wanting a hand out or a home. But he doesn't move from his comfortable kitty-warming spot on the couch, merely moves from one mouth to the next, letting them get their slurps in, the just fed kitten mewling for yet more.


The kitchen rustles in the meantime. Magda scratches at her side, her fingers only falling away when she touches her stomach. Instead she yanks open the fridge, grappling out the first bottle of lager she can see. She forsakes anything as civilized as a bottle opener, merely catching the lid on the lip of the counter and giving it a brutal smack. She reappears a few moments later, slowly, always at her own pace, seeking to lean her body hip-first against the nearest wall. The woman seems content to remain there, drink, and watch him.


Hellboy is remarkly gentle for a man who can crush skulls in one hand. The bottle is emptied in short order by three hungry kittens, and HB just leaaaaaaaaans back and enjoys the fact he's got three tiny, fuzzy babies sleeping on his chest. The simple pleasures are the best. Still, he is calm and complacent -- the unasked questions aren't waiting for her, and the man seems content to let her be as she is. He knew he pushed -- and he's not pushing now. ""You wanna hold one?"" he asks mildly, his left hand stroking down a tiny body, coaxing another petulant mewl from the kitten.



And when the unasked questions do not come, the woman seems to ease. She's very good at acting like nothing's happened, and prefers to repress what she can get away with. She puts a good dent in her beer, going as fast at it like the kittens do the milk, her ravenous drinking only stalled at Hellboy's question. Lowering the lager, Magda looks from him down to the baby cats on his chest, decision there on her face. Finally, she sets her beer down on a table, stepping closer to the couch. ""Yeah,"" she replies.

There are three cats; one a dusky gray-blue tortie, another simply black, and the smallest, the runt, looks like he was rolled in ash before he was brought here. None are very bright or lovely coats, and their eyes are yet to open. But Hellboy lifts his left hand, allowing Magda to take her pick of kitten, and then drops his hands over the remaining too, keeping them warm and secure, rumbling again and creating that strange purring rumble that echos through his chest. He needs not say anymore -- she can commune with the cat the same way he is if she likes, for all he care (though that does involve getting topless).


Magda doesn't meet Hellboy's eyes, but she does bite her lip as she must come in close. Her callused knuckles scrape his chest as she slowly, gingerly chooses the runt. Tension initially lines her face, lip bitten more harshly as she collects it, so afraid then and there of hurting the tiny little thing. She only steps back when she's sure she has it, the kitten held in her palm. She brings it in close, supporting her hand in the crook of her opposite elbow, holding it naturally there like a baby. She is exquisitely tender, but despite that, her expression doesn't mollify, her face steely as it stares down at the mewling thing. As if she 's not quite sure how to look.


Hellboy doesn't say anything, still; the peace is nice, and he's not inclined to disrupt it. He has his warmth, she now has a piece of it -- his and the kitten's both and the big guy is pretty content with both. He just grin slightly, orange eyes hooded and thick lashes obscuring the sliver of color that can be seen beyond the red and the black. Hmph. He watches her, though; but he says nothing. Just smiles. He has a feeling anything he would say would be taken wrong, anyway.


She holds the kitten tentatively, ever so unsure if she's doing this right. Magda's impractised when it comes to life's more breakable things, and her hands are used to shooting guns, stopping fists, and snatching up scum by the scruffs of their necks to cart away. Not cradling kittens. Fortunately, her uncertainty is short-lived; there's nothing quite as calming, as soothing as feeling a teeny tiny kitten nose back and forth, trying to find milk among her fingertips. Thoughtlessly, she shifts, moving to join him at one corner of the couch, her eyes locked on her little bundle. She's hooked. ""Christ, they're so tiny,"" she murmurs, speaking plainly and mindlessly.


""That one especially,"" Hellboy murmurs with a grin, before he opens his eyes. ""We should call him Ed."" ... ... ... You didn't hear that. Ed certainly didn't hear that. No body heard that. ""But, they're not really that old. Maybe a couple of weeks. Found 'em in an alley way -- momma cat was dead, so... I couldn't..."" He loves his kitties -- even now, they too love him. Damn kittens. Damn, damn kittens. He's such a pussy-whipped man -- this time, but the tamer variety.


""I know,"" she replies, all for many reasons. The obvious one is right there in her eyes; the second the kitten's tinky weight settled in her hand, her heart broke. Apparently her weakness for strays goes beyond her own species. Magda continues on slowly, ""It's fine by me,"" at his continued explanation, hoping herself he isn't trying to justify them being there. It makes her feel like some crusty landlady, with a stick in her ass shoved up as high as the rent. ""Not just a guest here -- I mean. I don't think you are. It's fine. Doing anything is.""


""Guest? Man, I'm one hell of a guest if I am. You know what sticks after three days? Fish and guests."" Yeah, Hellboy's cynical on the subject, but at least he's admitting that there's more here then just ... whatever it is. THat thing. That thing he doesn't...get. He just shrugs a little, and then says, ""We've got a funny little family forming here."" He chooses those words carefully. Hellboy picks his family as carefully as he did those words -- but that's what they're becoming -- at least, Magda and he; Ed is young, alone, and weird, and Hellboy resolves to make and effort with him. Maybe -- yes, with the cats. Later.


Magda takes to gently petting the kitten she's cradling, light, gentle strokes of the side of her thumb along its back. It mews into her finger pads. She listens to Hellboy speak as she does so, her slow, cyclic movement only hitching when he says 'family.' The reaction only lasts a moment, and it doesn't spread to her eyes, doesn't change the thoughtful look on her face. She seems to accept it. After a few seconds' pause, she exhales and slowly sits back, back arched, letting the kitten shift and settle in the cradle of her shoulder. She watches it even as she tells him, ""You make it easier.""


""Really?"" he says faintly, curious. ""I wouldn't think that -- but if it is, that's good."" He wonders what's easier; adjusting? Being here? Dealing with possessions and sombrero men? Or is it just the day to day things? He's not sure -- but he's not asking, either. He shifts a little, and then sighs, ""Here; there's a shoebox on the floor with a clock and a towel in it -- can you hand it to me so I can put 'em inside? I'll reheat supper.""


""'Course,"" she obliges quickly, worried that her brief, unusual lapse of fussing over an alley kitten might be keeping it from sleeping, or scheduled mewing, or whatever it is they do. Magda slowly inches the blind kitten back into her hands, offering it gingerly to Hellboy with a wily aside of, ""Here you go, Ed II."" The name's stuck.Huh?  (Type ""help"" for help.)


The kitty. So cute. So very cute. So very Ed II. Hopefully, less prickly then the boy, too. But he collects them all across his great, red hand. It's careful, sweet then -- he draws them up, and sits forward, and .. yes, just like that, gets the kittens into their padded shoebox and then scritches ears gently before he rises, and goes to the kitchen, getting out the tray full of lasagna to reheat-- two generous servings (one /really/ generous, but then, he eats a lot more then she does...)


Leaning back on the couch, a somewhat satisfied look on her face, Magda watches the kitten-filled shoebox at her own time. She gives her head a shake, and toeing herself slowly out of her shoes, she grapples her lager back up as she follows Hellboy back into the kitchen. It's not the smell of food that calls to her, doing rather just the drifting motions of a quiet woman, one who's set on ghosting him around at her own distance. For someone who disappeared for a good night and a day, now she's not too apt at being in a room alone. She drinks beer and watches him dish up, her eyes only moving away when she begins to mess through kitchen drawers for a pack of cigarettes.


The big man simply goes about being domestic, taking care of himself and her at the same time. But he leans against the counter and stretches slightly, rolling his shoulders and simply allowing himself to become -- well, more at ease now that she's back. ""So, we've named one,"" he says slowly, rubbing at the back of his neck with his left hand. ""We gonna name and keep the other two?"" From no friends to two people and three cats. What the hell is Magda thinking, eh? Did she get beamed onto the same ship as Ultra Polite Magda and was replaced, instead, by Overly Generous Magda? Or is that just normal Magda's nicer face?


Overly Generous Magda swears briskly to herself as she clunks through her drawers, which open and close noisily, her mood ready to go sour until she finds her back-up pack of Marlboros. She lets a dry cigarette hang from her lips as she resumes her steady crusade for her matches, only stopping to worm her fingers into her jean pockets at a sudden thought. Her head though turns toward Hellboy, her eyebrows raised expectantly the moment he starts to speak. She replies him with an amused sound, and the way she dismissively rolls a shoulder is just so different from the way she looked, holding that tiny kitten in her hand, letting it worm into her heart like a tiny grey-furred parasite. ""Up to you. You put more time into this place than me. You decide.""


""Bu--"" Dammit! Hellboy is caught. But his tail swishes through the air, his brows furrowing as he leans against the counter, hearing it thunk-thunk against a drawer. ""It's -- ah, hell. We'll keep 'em, then. Maybe it'll keep me from taking home every one I find."" Knowing he already has three. ""I'll name one, and we'll let Ed name one."" See? They each will have a Cat! Ed II will be Magda's, and then Ed and Hellboy can both name one and 'have' one! As much as one 'has' a cat -- rather, Hellboy acknowledges that the Cat Owns Him. But he doesn't say that now, not to Magda who is unaware that she just gave her new owner a name.


""Fine by me,"" she mumbles amiably around her cigarette, giving up on her amazing search for fire when her blouse sleeve gets caught in a drawer. Magda scowls to herself, her own breathy, impotent brand of annoyance, unbuttoning her shirt to just the simple tee she wears beneath. She hooks her finger in her hair elastic and lets her hair down in a snap, scrubbing at her scalp as she elongates her body for some serious, serious stretching. Of the peeking navel sort. Or, if she had a navel left, what for all the massive scarring, like she took a shell to the stomach. ""If those furballs are staying,"" she intones, ""I'll have to rename Ed II, y'know. Unless I wake its namesake to be redismantling my house. And he would.""


Hellboy laughs softly -- though it cuts off in a breathy cough, and Hellboy shakes his head, looking away. He didn't mean to glance, to look -- but he did. Still, it is hard to notice where those pupiless eyes have traveled. Still, he just goes about his business, getting utensils out of the drawers, walking around the table and laying down places. Then he goes back to the stove, and gets the dish of lasagna -- no hot pad required. He simply takes it up and puts it down on the hot-pad on the /table/, and then goes about dishing up servings. ""There,"" he says. ""Sit, eat. And think of a proper name for Eddy II.""


Whether or not a look was given, Magda didn't catch it. She's too busy looking for her goddamned matches. She gives up after a while, until her relentless searching's hit a point of irritation, and swipes up her beer and takes it with her to the table. She sits sloppily, more than likely a veteran of more than a day's worth of sleeplessness, one long leg hooking over the arm of her chair. No lady here. ""Names,"" she says, taking out her cigarette and replacing it with her lager. If she can't have one addiction, she'll have the other. ""I suck at naming things.""


""I'm sure you'll think of something. Hopefully not something offensive, so if they get out, we're not going down the street yelling, 'Get back here, Shithead', and meaning it."" He pauses, and then says, ""Knew a guy who named his dog as a comic book character. He regreted that later, going down the street, calling for his puppy when it got loose in a park -- everybody through he was nuts."" He shrugs, then, and sits down at the table to eat one he's collected a glass of water. Not that the lager sn't basically flavored water to him, but... may as well have the real thing.


Amused, she gives her head a shake, finally arranging her lanky body to sit straight once food enters her peripherals. She picks up her fork, poking idly at the lasagna on her plate. Always poking, never eating. She sits back and soaks it up, her appetite more for these rare, lazy, absolutely mindless moments than any sort of sustenance. She leans her elbow on the table, etiquette missing her by a mile -- polite Magda's still abducted aboard the mother ship. She paws her hair back from her face, watching Hellboy through her tired, lowered lids and lashes. ""What're you aiming on naming yours?""


Hellboy thinks quietly, and then considers, ""I'll name the black one. He's a boy, and I'll call him Broom."" He smiles slightly, taking a bite of his food, letting himself savor it where Magda does not. ""That was my dad's nickname -- Trevor Brutenholm, but everybody called him Prof. Broom."" He's not sure to the origin of the nickname, but seems quite amused with it. ""So that'll be mine."" He grins slightly, and then notes, ""I suppose If I want, I could legally register under Hellboy Brutenholm; technically I was adopted, and that is my name, I guess...""


It's not to say Magda is averse to eating -- she's just never been formally acquainted. She forks up a mouthful of lasagna now and then, appreciating it more deeply than her expression may ever let on. Home-cooked meals are a rarity, so much that they're still baffling, that she's still trying to get used to it all. ""That's right,"" she gravels back. ""We should lay off the cats a moment, get you a damn name first. And -- I'm gonna have to do something about the living arrangements too. I've got a loft up there, Red. I've been thinking a lot about it. The ceiling's real high, and it opens up into a balcony. How about I clean it out, just got some old boxes and storage, get you some kind of bed, and set you up in there? Space to call your own.""


Hellboy arches a brow, and then blinks, considering -- a name, a loft, space, his. Wow. That did jump tracks a great deal. He thinks on it though, his orange eyes shaded with the processes flicking behind them. ""Shouldn't we be moving Ed up there? He's the kid -- and you can have your room back."" Hellboy's never been one concerned about his personal comfort -- must like Magda, he isn't adverse to it, it's just not anything he's really well acquainted with.


Magda fully intends to give them proper introductions. Whether or not doing so kills her. ""Ed's fine. It works for him. I'm gonna have to get him settled there -- but that's a whole different thing. I'm fine on the couch, Red. I'm never home, so it's more than enough for me. But you're sleeping on the floor! So I'm moving you from coach to first-class. No one's using that space, so I'll getcha settled in,"" she says, all finalizing-like, as though there should be no further debate on the issue.


Hellboy opens his mouth to argue -- to protest, something! But. No. So denied. He grunts, then, and shakes his head. ""What a willful woman you are,"" he says with a grin. ""You're going to give a man a hell of a handful, some day."" But he doesn't say it like it's a bad thing -- no, it sounds like he'd look forward to a challenge of a similar sort. Still, he goes right back to eating his lasagna, thinking nothing more of his errant comment, and trying instead to plot the escape from luxury - or a room of his own, anyway.


And it's almost there, just a shade darker than usual, and it'd only take a very studious eye to see that Magda is smug. Willful is only the beginning of it. She is queen, her kitchen chair her throne, her lager bottle her shining scepter, and her loyal subjects inclusive of one half-metal kid, three kittens, and an antichrist. She takes her victories where they come, and it encourages her to take another rare, triumphant bite of lasagna. She looks rather content to keep smugging, at least up to the point where Hellboy speaks. A wistful look crosses Magda's face, nothing sudden, nothing severe, and she pensively returns to poking her food.


Hellboy knows when not to poke, and it is now. He simply finishes his meal, and begins to clean up, tail tucking his chair back under the table once he turns around with plate in hand. He turns on the water, gets to washing. None of the electric dishwasher when it's so small and insignificant. He simply cleans up after himself. ""Actually, you know the only thing that has me worried is clothes,"" he finally admits. ""I don't really fit into the Big and Tall set, even.""


Appetite not even there to be lost, Magda exhales as she leans back in her chair, forsaking her fork for her beer. She upturns it to finish the bottle, setting it down, wetting her lips briefly as her eyes go elsewhere. She stands up, scratching absently at the small of her back as she pads toward the fridge. Need more beer. She only crosses a look back towards Hellboy at his mention of clothes, peering at him like she's noticed the tail et al for the first time. ""--Right. How do you... do ya make your clothes?""


Hellboy laughs, then, and says, ""I don't! I had a tailor. We all did -- the freaks in the agency. We had someone who designed clothes for the lot of us. I mean, as a kid, it was simple -- a careful split in the pants of some undersized fatigues, cut the sleeve for Righty here to slide through, and that was that. But now? I'm a little big for hand-me-downs."" He doesn't seem to notice her gaze or where it goes. He considers, and then says, ""I'm not sure what to do about clothes here. I've got some shorts and my coat, and a couple of work-suits but -- you know, unless I'm going to get a job bouncing a fetish meta bar, my leather bodysuits are not going outside of this house.""


It's by being fate's bitch, that Magda's eyes are slanted at the worst spot the moment Hellboy mentions bodysuits. Her pupils narrow and her jaw tightens, hands clasping around her fished-out bottle of lager. She's blushing furiously, or was a moment ago, because her back's turned the moment she remembers how to move. She fusses bemusedly with the lid on her beer, and though they'll never pop it off, she'll sure as hell try! ""Leather -- bodywhat? I -- oh.""


There's that sound, and Hellboy glances over his shoulder, and blinks. ""Huh?"" he blinks once, and then snorts. ""Yeah, yeah, you get your giggles about leather bodysuits over there. Shit, woman. Had to wear something durable!"" He shakes his head a little, and then leans against the counter, looking at her still-there food. ""You know, that's gonna sit there till you eat it all. You're skin and bones, Mags. You gotta eat just a little. I mean, what if one day, Ed /is/ bigger then you?""


Rubbing her face until she's sure she exorcised every one of those mental images, particularly of the Hellboy in leather sort, Magda clears her throat into her palm. She does the same kitchen counter treatment to her lager, punching off the cap, catching the falling piece of tin on her instep. She flicks her foot at the garbage bin. ""Can't have that,"" she replies airily. ""Then we'd have to rename the cat."" She drinks to regain her amusement. ""Sit there till I eat it all -- what'm I? Grounded to the kitchen table?""


Hellboy mutter something about revenge and wearing the body suit about the house, stopping short as he hears bang of the lager. ""Hey! You could have just given that to me, ya know."" He snorts softly, and then drys his hands once his plate and utensils are both clean, dried, and put away. He then leans back against the counter, folding his arms over his chest, giving Magda a look. He rolls his eyes once, and then sighs. ""Yes, you are. So eat.""


Magda doesn't laugh. She's not a smiler. She's not a giggler. She doesn't chuckle. And she most certainly doesn't titter -- like she does right now, the sound come low and smokey, hitched at the end because, Christ, is she god damn amused like never before. She leans her hip on the counter herself, taking another contented drink of her beer, assuming he's just kidding about it all.


Hellboy knows she's not the most easy-going woman, but a laugh is a laugh, even a breathy hitched one. Hellboy is pleased, though, he seems quite happy with what he's gotten out of her. ""General Ricker had it worse. He had to teach me to eat people food. When I was a kid, I though the highest level being in the base was the base dog, Mac. Kept trying to eat dog food. The dry, rough kind. Then he gave me noodles, and I never complained about being denied dogfood again.""


Turning her back to the counter, it's a testament to her upper-body strength that she one-handedly pushes herself, with a hop, to sit up on there. Magda's more than skin and bones in some places. Letting her legs dangle, bare toes flexing, she stoops her back and puts a dent in her beer. The warmth of the alcohol keeps the faded ghost of a smirk on her mouth. ""That's cute,"" she replies between gulps, pointing a finger at him. ""And seriously detrimental to your cigar-smoking tough guy image. Noodles,"" she echoes, way too amused.


""You haven't seen what I'll do for a Baby Ruth yet, if you think that's unmanly,"" Hellboy says with a rol of his eyes, unimpressed by her strength or her commentary -- though it does make his lip quirk, his smile sneaking back into place. ""Hot noodles. I love 'em. Baby Ruth, Pancakes, and Noodles. My three food loves."" He considers. ""Though I like bad Chinese and Italian, and some good Romanian cooking... One of these days, I'll make paprika chicken. Mmm. Good stuff."" Yeah. So manly, this cooking fool.


Terribly. If she doesn't watch it, she might start laughing again -- yet not in an insulting manner, or rather intended not to be, but laughter for the sake of entertainment. Magda doesn't get to know many people, and she's seriously tickled by learning about the little quirks. She drinks as he listens, replying him at her own pace with a mindless, ""Nice."" It's pretty obvious the topic of food isn't an engaging one to her; she hasn't touched the lasagna she's been ordered to eat.


Shaking his head, he turns then, pushing away from the counter -- though his tail catches around her ankle and gives a little tug before he releases it as he heads to the table. He then takes up the plate, and stabs the fork into the lasagna getting a chunk of it, and then sets himself to placing his considerable mass right infront of her. And then he grins, just a little. ""Now, General Rickler also had the damnest time getting me to meet. So, one day on base -- I was two -- he sits me down and says I cannot have hot noodles. I must try pancakes."" He says this, with the lasagna laden fork in his left hand, the right holding the plate. ""I resisted -- but an order was an order, and he /was/ a General."" He then clears his throat, and BOOMS in his basso voice, ""EAT THE PANCAKE,"" he mimics, and then says, slightly more gently. ""Now, eat the frickin' lasagna, woman!""


Though the tug doesn't seriously jar her, Magda still clamps a reflexive hand on the edge of the counter, her grey eyes cut after Hellboy. She remains where she is, a casual, haphazard kitchen gargoyle perched on this parapet, though sadly not so much protecting as just lazing around. Her lidded eyes follow Hellboy, watching him curiously. She doesn't know whether to be confused or amused, and she hates being confused so she sticks with the latter. When he returns with her unfinished plate in hand, she eyes him, exhales, and then drinks her beer --

And nearly chokes on it when he mentions EATING PANCAKES. Magda coughs in surprise, barely swallowing it down, that and her heart that just tried to evict itself from her ribcage. Getting her wits back, she hugs her lager closer like a knight would his sword, her eyes dropping from him to the food. She's starting to grasp it. ""--You're serious."""

"event","<lj-cut text=""In which Magda takes things pooly, and asks hard questions."">

""Don't take it so hard,"" Hellboy says as he comes up behind her, wet and unaware that he should be cold and uncomfortable, but yet, is not. ""It's just -- gonna take some getting used to. This... is what I do, really."" He shrugs slightly. ""Put your head in the sand if you gotta, but find some way to deal."" And then he's clopping onward, his wisdom spoken -- face it, hide from it, but some how, cope with it. He's not changing at all, not now, not this. This is what he is. This is what he does.


""Take it so hard?"" she booms back, though her low, papery voice barely cuts over the rushing wall of rain. It's a stinging, powerful thing, but the torrential cold comes with one gift: it numbs skin rather pleasantly. Makes you dismiss the wet. Lose the usual aches. Forget the pounding headache. Linger there so that every argumentive word can be enunciated just right. ""What'd you mean by that? Buck up, sport! It's just a ghost! Not forgetting they're actually /real!/ Trying to pep talk me, huh?"" Magda turns her eyes away, rather quick to dismiss him entirely -- only not. Her voice rings back out. ""I happen to have a great way of dealing! And it involves being right outside!"" She gestures! ""Right here!"" She points! ""And havin' a goddamn smoke!"" She yanks out a second cigarette! --And watches it go soggy like its lost brother. She crosses her arms.


""You face down rapists, murderers, scum of the earth -- men with hearts and souls that had, maybe, every chance to be good and threw it away."" Hellboy says pointedly. ""I, on the other hand, face down the weird shit. The things that don't really have souls -- and if they do, they're probably stolen from some virgin girl who got her heart cut out with a golden knife. We both deals with piles of crap, but there's no reason to go losin' it because you've seen something weird. I've gotten involved in some cases that have been total mundane. Crazy guys who THINK They're channel Satan, but in fact, just nuts."" In his wisdom, he doesn't go into what happens then. He just shoves his hands -- well, hand -- into his pocket and flexes the fingers of the other. It clicks, grinds, stone against stone, in the most unnatural way. ""You've weathered me. You need to be able to weather this. Pep talk? Hell no. I don't really do pep talks.""


She paces while he talks, going back and forth through the sheet of rain. Butting against her hip every second step is the bottle of scotch, hoisted along forcefully with its neck swallowed up by her fierce fingers. Magda doesn't know whether to feel tempestuous or just tired. She's no fan of Beacon Habor, and loathes it idea of many of its monsters. As if the world isn't bad enough, isn't choking already on its human scum, it has to venture out into new flavours. Bring about bigger, stronger, more horrible things. The stuff that he's really, really -- really good at stopping. It bugs her that it's so damn confusing, that it's just not all that simple to take in stride, that when she thinks she has one weird encounter one, the next makes a royal flush. It bugs her.

Or it did, at least until a few choice words out of Hellboy inspire such a look out of Magda, hitting her to the quick. ""I'm not losing it,"" she tells him lowly, somehow sensitive about that. She stares at him, like a deer in front of headlights, like a cop getting mental assessment, and asks, ""You think I'm losing it?""


""Losing it? No."" Hellboy says, slowly, as he walks along, his hooves splosh-sploshing in the wet. ""I don't think that at all. I do think, however, you need to get a grip."" He pauses, and then considers his words, slowly. Carefully. It's a long time thinking, standing there in the rain, as he weighs the words he uses, and then says, ""I'm not really one to talk about running -- I've been doing it all my life. But Magda, whatever you're running from, whatever you left behind in Vegas... you gotta let it go. Or it's gonna kill you.""

His peace said, he turns, then, orange eyes like the burn of cigarette butts in a dryer clime. And just like that, he starts walking away, continuing their path toward home, rain sluicing down the valleys of his coat.


She's got an expressive face for such little expression. And though she's trained her eyes and stubborn mouth well to show next to nothing, her poker face is nowhere near a Maverick. Stopped in her tracks, Magda looks like she's been kicked in the gut. His direct words surprise her to no end, shock her harder than any degree of chill from the pouring rain. She pauses a couple heartbeats before walking again. Some part of her wonders how in the hell bickering about ghosts turned into this, but it has. Shocked, irritated, and extremely guilty, Magda stares at the scotch bottle as she walks. She walks for a while. And when she pauses again many minutes later, it's a sudden, drastic thing. When she finally speaks, her voice is heavy. ""Uh. I'm gonna meet up with you later. Back at the house. OK?""


Hellboy stops, then, in the rain, glancing down at his diminutive landlady. He thinks on it a moment. A long moment. ""Yeah. But don't be gone too long -- You need a hot shower and a warm bed."" The couch, he knows, will have to do. But hell, at least that gives him time to get home and do what he just told her she needed -- a hot shower and bed down on floor... it's a start, he thinks, but... ah well. ""I'll wait up,"" he notes, as well -- no running off or doing anything stupid. But then he plods onward, the rain hardly an obstacle to his homeward travel.


And she watches him walk for a moment, her arms coming up to cross over her chest tightly, the forgotten scotch bottle still hung from her hand. Magda stares at Hellboy, not angrily, not miserably, not much of anything there on her face but rain. She moves quickly then, a little rashly, finally taking notice of her surroundings. Choosing her new direction entirely on a whim, she hastily turns to cross the street and stride away, letting the rain lose her. Somewhere in those quickening steps, there's a pause to take a first, fast mouthful of scotch. They can just try to wrist lock her.


Hellboy heads for him -- straight, narrow. Through the streets, and the rain, till he stops.


Sounds. An alley. Aw, hell. Poking his head inside, he finds what he's look for; a dead cat, and kittens. He looks down upon the miserable, rain-soaked bundles, shivering and cold and he just... sighs.

This night could not get any better.

Kneeling down, the takes them up, carefully, from their dead mother's side, and cradles the three of them in his great, right hand, tucking it under his coat. Thus, distracted, he heads back to their empty, quiet home. Damn kid is probably sleeping in the library again.

When he's back at the house, it's simple; a box is found, a towel too -- kittens are carefully dried, despite the wet, and laid in there to sleep. He forgets about being dry, or shower -- he just changes clothing, toweling down while they nose at their surroundings in the living room, unable to see yet, they're so young and small. 

The urge to punch the mirror, the wall, something, is strong. But he doesn't. He simply collects himself. Piece by piece, he simply takes himself through the routine of cleaning himself up, before he heads into the kitchen with a boxfull of kitten. He heats milk. 

Nursing kittens passes the time well."

<lj-cut text=""In which Magda sees her first exorcism."">

Magda had actually managed to get into Koudelka's attention with her comments. The woman was turning partially away from Hellboy to power at her and point an accusing finger. ""And you can just back off, because you don't have anything to do with this. He's here for m*URK!*"" That sound would be a rather startled possessed gypsy, getting grasped by the shirt and yanked up to face off with the craggy-jawed demon. Her eyes are practically reverent, though. At last! Does this mean you're ready to-.... dropped. And demanded. Apparently not, no. ""But... but... you're _supposed_ to be here for _me_."" the medium points out, looking horribly pouty again. ""You were _supposed_ to come to me and bring me to my Master. That's what they told me!"" Apparently, someone never asked why Satan was called the Lord Of Lies.


""Lady, I'm not--oh, hell with arguing with a possessed nutcase."" 

Hellboy reaches out to try and get a hold of his 'lover' and then says, even as he does, ""Magda, hold her a minute. I need to get some ash for the fire. She wants a ritual to send her where she wants to go, I'll give her one..."" He's agreeing to this?! He's finally giving in?

No, not really. But she doesn't need to know this.


At least there's something vacated Magda's body, though best guess says it's her sanity. 'Possessed?!' she mouths again to herself, a strange look crinkling up her features. Either way, she obliges Hellboy, despite all the talk of mastering and demon hotcha that she's just not gonna start thinking about. In the case that it's not a -- she can't say the word -- it could simply be a very drunk woman, and she knows how to handle public displays of inebriation. She steps forward crispily, her hands shot out in the attempt to snag one of Koudelka's arms: one behind the elbow and the other clapped over to bend in her wrist. If she can manage it, it's a classic wrist lock, and it hurts like fuck if there's flailing. Despite all that, her grey eyes shock a surprised look back on Hellboy, the poor cop from her poor real world just as duped by his words. ""You're giving what?"" she asks, hoping all they're dealing with is a case of too many mickeys.


There's no flailing. There's a squawk of indignity from the woman, though, shooting a glare back at Magda. ""I don't need this! I can hold still! I've been waiting for this for so long!"" Fortunately, she doesn't struggle against the wristlock at the moment. Koudelka will probably be thankful for that, later. Instead, the woman turns her eyes, filled with a sort of insane reverence, toward Hellboy. Yeah. Some people just aren't all-there. And death doesn't help that.


A glance is shot Annie, apologetic in the extreme. ""I swear I'll clean up ANY mess this makes,"" Hellboy says, though he knows it may cause him some regret. He remembers the Tod case; he never exploded a guy from the inside out before, but man, what a /mess/. Came out wearin' a dead guy's shirt and.. yeah. It was gross. But he goes and sticks his hand /right in the fire place and where's a SNAP and a CRUNCH -- and he comes away with a chunk of burning wood. Yeah, a proper fire place. Who knew? But he mashes it up in his hands, grumbling the entire time; once he has a handful -- the RIGHT hand -- of black and gray ash, he sighs, and says, ""Magda, step back. Miss, stay in the circle I'm gonna make for you, okay?""

And just like that, he starts prepping ritual circles. Yeah, he's in work mode. He doesn't realize JUST how weird this looks to the owner, his friend, this other patron, or anything else. But hey, it's Beacon Harbor. Weirder things have happened, right? Right?


Magda really, really wishes that the damn woman was just drunk. But whoever gets a lucky break in this town. She stares incredulously at Hellboy, watching him draw circles -- idly reminded of Edward that evening ago when he and that strange blue light managed to fix her broken home. Maybe this circle will fix her? The sheer similarity of the instances helps her slowly release Koudelka from the lock. Doing as she's told, the cop steps warily back. ""She gonna be OK?""


Several of the other patrons have already edged out by this time. 'Several', meaning 'all of them'. So patron-wise, Hellboy's got all the space he needs. Annie's still in here, and she's watching with a sort of impassive blase that speaks worlds of just how long the Crescent Moon has been here. Yeah. She's seen it before, all right. ""Just don't burn down the pub, please. We just got it replaced a couple of weeks ago."" she says to Hellboy. Yeah. Been there. Done that. Glad that most of it got taken away by the demon's bar just down the street. Most, but not all.

Koudelka's been released, her hand rubbing at the locked wrist and shooting Magda a rather put-out look. The _nerve_. ""Of _course_ I'll stay here!"" She's supposed to, isn't she? That's what she's been _trying_ to get Hellboy to do, right? And she's very patient. Really. *PATIENT*. ""Hurry up, Lover-boy. I'm getting so tired of this. I want to _go_."" Ok. Not so patient.


""I certainly hope so,"" Hellboy says in a low voice, before he straightens once the circle is complete. And then he straightens up, and then opens his mouth to rebuke the 'lover-boy' comment, and then just snaps it shut and growls. Then, slowly, his right hand goes to his belt, and he steps out of the circle. Alas, for Koudelka's passenger, it's not to undo his belt and drop trou; it's to take up the rosary that's always somewhere on his person. Tonight, it hung from his beltpouch. The beads, so small against his thick, stone fingers, are wound carefully between them, and he holds it up even as he reveals the amulet in his left hand.

And this is when the latin invocation begins, rich syllables of that dead language rolling off Hellboy's tongue like wine from the font; he speaks it so easily, so well and so deftly, this dead language suddenly come to life, it may be hard for one to realize he's invoking the circle and binding a possessing spirit. The short of his beautiful, foreign language evocation is this: Spirit, I command thee -- release thy host and return to the dark from whence you came!


This is one of the times it's probably for the best that Magda isn't a big talker. She seems more than grateful to step away, take a bewildered, disoriented sideline to this morbid scene. Despite that, she's still antsy, unsure, hating that she doesn't know what's supposed to happen. She shares just about the same gawk as any other wrong-place-wrong-time patron of this bar, her eyes flared wide and her frowning jaw grit shut. Her stare flickers back and forth between Hellboy and Koudelka, the fingers on her hands flexing as though this were some high noon show down. All she can do now is watch.


Poor Magda. Thrown into a world where she really doesn't belong. And who says that it's only the immigrants who have that problem? The possessed woman's face is smug at first, then almost reverent as the demon-looking man goes to reach for himself. But the look turns to abject confusion as he pulls out the rosary. _That_ sure shouldn't be there. Not unless he's about to defile it, or something kinkier than-... ""What? Wait! No! What are you-..."" The energies are felt even before the chant gets into its full power. But by that time, there's nothing the woman can do. Fighting back when one is standing in the middle of a binding circle is fairly impossible, really. The gypsy gives a frustrated cry, making a move as though to leap for Hellboy to stop him, but halting as abruptly as if she'd hit a very real, very physical wall. A moment later, the cry is stifled off as Koudelka's body jerks, the phantom pulled from her body and left to drop to the ground in a boneless heap. And the spirit, as burned and charred as before, and leaving a sharp cry through the air that's felt as much as heard, is dragged back into the fireplace that the eruption had spawned from. Almost in reverse, there's a flare of flame, the spirit is 'dropped' into it and seemingly consumed by the violence of the burning, then... nothing. The fire gutters back down to its normal self with only a few extra sparks tossed out onto the floor.


Hellboy smiles. He loves it when it's simple.

Pocketing the amulet, he glances back at the fireplace, and then down at the crumpled heap of Koudelka, before he sighs, and then says, ""Pour me a scotch, wouldja, Mags? And ma'am, can I have a rag with some cool water? -- And maybe a bucket? They puke, sometimes. Would really rather not mop."" And all the same, he shifts a hoof through the ash, breaking the circle, and then leans over to pick up Koudelka's inert body. Yeah, he's a nice guy. He's gonna lay her out carefully, somewhere -- a booth, a bench, somewhere comfortable.


Poor Magda indeed. The energies are felt, and perhaps by no one as well as her. By the way she keeps inching back, by the way her hands clamp on each side of her head, it almost looks like she's gone mad, scared right out of her wits. Her hands clamp harder, and though she's nervous, it's not because of that. The moment the energy rises into the room, harsh and powerful, it feels as though her head wants to explode. Her brains want to mash against her skull. Squeeze out through her eyes. Gritting her jaw through the sudden, confusing pain, her body reacting as though it weren't hers, it's through some grace of something she even has the mind to look up.

The pained look leaves her when she sees Koudelka. Magda seems to forget about possessions. Oh god, the woman's in pain. Steeling herself, she takes a furious step forward, protective instincts raised... and squashed flat again. The images burn themselves in her eyes, her grey eyes reflecting double-images of the exorcism. Her head starts to pound again, her muscles cramping and insides knotting, her body disliking this, but the cop can only react to far to clamp both hands over her mouth. And it ends. And she stares. She claps a palm on her throbbing crown. She stares some more. She nods a bit, though she doesn't hear a thing Hellboy says. She just needs a minute.


Koudelka will likely need a little more than a minute. She's alive, at least. Breathing rhythmically, as though she's just asleep. Her face has gone fairly pale, but not deathly grey. And she's not board-stiff when Hellboy scoops her up to get her to a comfy spot. Just rag-doll limp. Gonna be a minute before her body can finish processing this whole 'back to itself' thing. Ghosts. They just don't know the meaning of the word 'off-duty'.


Satisfied with Koudelka's condition, Hellboy moves to the bar to get a couple of glasses of water, and then two wet rags, this time, tossing one over each shoulder -- not like he wasn't wet when he came in here. He takes the water over to Magda first, though, and says, ""Here, just drink something. You -- you're not lookin' so hot, Mags,"" he says shortly. ""You gonna be all right? Sit down..."" He doesn't miss a whole lot -- while he was plenty busy during the exorcism, well, that's one thing, but Magda's pretty obviously in pain. He can't miss THAT.


Magda still breathes hard, but not in agony. The strange, crushing pain seemed to whuff out like a candleflame the moment the haphazard exorcism ended, and she's exhaling in brisk relief. The resulting headache is nothing to laugh at, but she accepts it graciously, feeling like a rainbow in comparison to five seconds ago. And what the hell was that all about? Despite that, she looks confused more than anything, rubbing the heel of her hand gingerly at her temple as the other automatically accepts the water. Then she notices Hellboy standing there. ""Me?"" she asks, like she's not quite caught on. She exudes a shaky puff of air. ""What about /you/ -- you're OK?! What -- euh, her!"" Water sloshes out of the glass as she uses that hand to point towards Koudelka. Who is not looking good herself. ""And she OK?!""


""Nnnhhh....."" That, loosely translated, would be Koudelka saying 'Yeah. I'm Ok.' Or rather, a guttural sound that's acknowledgement of her stirring. Not completely up and around yet, but she's trying to reach toward that 'consciousness' thing. Eyes still closed, somewhat hazy to the world, still, she mutters a couple things in a musical language, if slightly rough-throated. Usually, it's a language she would get away with, too. No one in this city but a few select people speak 19th century Romany. ... three of which, naturally, are in this room right now. Four, if you count the fact that Annie probably knows the basics from Koudelka being in here that often. And the comments made? Well, let's just say that if sailors could speak Rom, they'd be taking notes.


Glancing over, Hellboy arches a brow at Koudelka's colorful language. Well, then. ""See, she's cursing up a storm. She's fine. Probably a medium -- that spirit entered without so much as an argument from her. Next to no struggle."" Not that HE isn't familiar with such problems, noooooooooooo. Ahem. The big guy then reaches down and pours HIMSELF his scotch, and drains it sharply, giving a hissing exhale afterwards. Yeah, yeah, this is all routine to him -- but he never, ever does the fall out. That's some other agent's job. He just bitchslaps the monster. End of story. So... Anyway. He goes back over to the bar, and asks, ""You got a dustpan and broom? I'll clean up that mess, no problem.


Cursing up a storm. And then some. A surprised look contorts Magda's face at the regorge of Romany, the real question being why she can understand those curses -- or how in the hell someone could say those things in the first place. Rubbing tenderly, detachedly still at her brow, she watches Hellboy retreat back towards the bar, looking rather like the lost puppy herself. Soon enough, she walks slowly, hitchedly towards Koudelka, stopped at a wary, respectful distance from the booth where the woman remains couched and cussin'. ""Hey,"" she grunts. ""You good there?""


""Here you are."" Yep. Annie's too used to things going on in this city. She doesn't look as though the whole thing fazed her very much. That's a day in the city for you, yep. Broom and dustpan, and she retreats back behind the bar to give the bottles a wipe and check.

Meanwhile, Koudelka's finishing up her little tirade at stupid, thoughtless ghosts who don't know the meaning of the word 'permission'. Well, it was rather more colorful than that, but that's the gist of it. Drawing herself up, she lays her forehead down across her knees, heedless of the fact that she might well look fairly ridiculous doing it. Just want to get her head cleared. ""I'm fine."" she says, muffled into her knees, not looking up at Magda just yet. Once the room stops spinning. ""And yeah,"" she confirms as well, ""your demon-friend is right. I'm a medium. Now. What happened?"" Blank spot in memory. Let's just get confirmation that no one's dead, right?


""Not. A. Demon."" Hellboy says, his clipped tone not even conveying his full irritation, even as he goes to sweep up the mess. ""My name is Hellboy. HB. I don't care. But if you call me 'demon' one more time I'm gonna get /real/ cranky."" And he goes back to sweeping, tail whipping back and forth with excess, frustrated energy. Yeah, he just frees you from possession and you keep calling him that goddamn /word/. That's gratitude for ya. Grr. Grr. Argh. He doesn't even supply her with the information she asked for. She can wonder for all he cares.


The cop's pale eyes lift then. She turns a glance over her shoulder, stealing a glance of Hellboy alternating sweeping and seething. She gives him an imploring look. ""Not a demon,"" Magda echoes a moment after to punctuate his words, her own voice low but empathic. Despite her trace of glower, she's still ever the girl scout, and she gently reaches towards Koudelka. Her callused fingers are far from that previous wrist lock, and if she can, she's ever so careful trying to lay two fingers on her neck to feel for her pulse -- to time it. ""And, lady, you really don't wanna know.""


""No. No, I think I do."" Koudelka doesn't yank away from the lock, though the touch brings her head up in a sharp glower at Magda. But she tames down soon after that. Right. Checking pulse. Not trying to grab for or rip the throat out. Although Magda's going to be getting a rather measured, suspicious look for as long as her fingers are there. And although the woman's pulse is fluttering a bit quickly, still recovering from a bit of a scare, it's strong and healthy. ""Not a demon,"" Koudelka mimics, though not in a sarcastic tone. ""... sorry."" There. You got an apology. And though it's hesitant, the tone is earnest. Grudging, but earnest. She hates giving apologies to someone she doesn't know. But in this case? She somehow thinks it's warranted. And not just for the whole 'demon' thing, because God only _knows_ what she did while she was out.


Hellboy brings back the dustpan and broom, giving them back to Annie with a soft murmur of apology -- he hates when his work gets in the lives of normal people. But he also uncurls a twenty from his pocket, and slides that over -- for driving out clientele, making a mess, and generally getting in the way. He thinks of it as a very big tip, if he must. But then he looks back at the other two, giving Koudelka a slight nod -- apology accepted -- and then looking to Magda. ""You gonna be okay?"" he asks, his eyes shadowed and half-lidded.


Magda only takes her hand off Koudelka when it seems like the woman isn't about to have a post-traumatic heart attack over...whatever that was. She only gives her a tense, strained look, her eyes wavering as she tries to evade the medium's initial demand. God knows she doesn't want to explain what just happened -- if just partly because she doesn't know what the hell that was herself. Luckily, Hellboy distracts her. Stepping back to give the other woman back her personal space, the cop rubs flimsily at the back of her neck, her attention off and way up to meet his eyes. ""'Course,"" she says airily, only half-remembering why he'd be asking that. That was so weird. Reminds her of the migraines she used to get up and down the neon strips of Vegas. Sometimes so bad she'd be drinking aspirin. ""What about you? You're good and everything? Not hurt from -- that?""


Well, if Magda's not going to answer her question, maybe Hellboy will. Koudelka doesn't ask it again, but she turns to look at the big red man, eyebrows arched questioningly, but not really voicing the question. Not until she realizes that she's well away from her drink. And so while the important question doesn't actually get re-voiced, the second-most-important one does. ""Would you bring my beer over here?""


Hellboy laughs, though it's not really felt; the bass is hollow and there's little honest humor to it. ""Hurt? Nah, insulted a little, but not hurt. But it's hardly the first time I've been ...mistaken for something I'm not, if you get my drift."" He's just going to nurse his bruised feelings and stick his head in the sand a little deeper tonight, thanks. But as Koudelka asks for her beer, Hellboy nods, and since he's closest, takes it up and over to her. ""And really, nothing happened. Possession, bitchy ghost wanting a favor. I exorcised it. No biggie."" ...Yeah, like he does this every day.


The mention of insult doesn't escape Magda. Though it's not in her voice, though it may never be there on her face, she has a sudden, and strange way of conveying her weird attempts to console. All that talk of alcohol has her drifting back towards their original booth, and on the way her hand reaches to clasp briefly, but purposefully. Taking her hand back, she begins to step off, but that whim soon becomes a high hope in hell. Magda whips a fierce look back, feeling her headache magnify. She remembers hearing about possession. She remembers hearing about vacating, but nothing about -- ""Ghosts?!"" The grey-eyed woman looks slapped. No fucking way. ""Those /can't/ be --"" She snaps her jaw shut. She grates a low sound, something harsh and winded, and then just marches toward the booze.


""Yes. _Ghosts_. Spirits. Phantoms. Dead souls stuck on this plane. Whatever you want to call them."" Koudelka looks like she swallowed something very, very sour. And barbed. ""Shit."" That was in English this time, too. ""I wish they would _ask_ before they do that."" Hellboy's not the only one sounding like he does this every day, either. ""I just got done with spending around a month in someone else's brain. 'Don't need for them to start doing it _without_ being invited."" Pause. A large drink of her beer as though to bolster herself from the upcoming effort. A couple half-beats. ""..... thanks."" comes out afterward, just as grudging as the apology. ""I owe you.""


Hellboy shakes his head. ""Another world, and I'd be just be sayin', 'Just doin' my job, ma'am. Maybe --"" He cuts himself off there, and hmmms to himself, before he leans over to Magda and says, ""Take the scotch; we'll go home, and drink there,"" he says simply. Gotta get her back to a safe, neutral place to talk her down from the shock, so she doesn't burst a blood vessel or something. Sheesh. Some people's kids.

With that said, he goes to get his coat, giving Annie a polite nod-and-smile and shaking his head quietly. What a night, man, what a night.


Magda briefly claps her hands over her ears at Koudelka's extended description of the town's walking dead, though the gesture's more irritated than truly terrified. The thought still does make her turn green. Ghosts. Real. Dead. Alive. That is so not cool. Her bad mood come crashing down, she humours Hellboy's suggestion by in fact roping up her beloved scotch, muttering all the while. ""'damn smoke,"" are the only actual words rung through her bleary, mumbly rant, her glaring eyes honed forward. She pats her coat and comes out with a cigarette. It bobs between her murmuring lips, almost waving its own bidding good-bye even as the cop irritably storms out into the raining streets. The doors thunk.


Koudelka likely would have cut Hellboy off even if he _hadn't_ continued on. ""I _said_, I owe you one."" comes the tone that's bearing no argument on that half. Then, quieter, ""I don't do charity."" whether Hellboy and Magda are still there to hear or not, by that time. I have my chair. I have my beer. I have enough money for another mug. I'm quite happy to stay here a while longer.


""And I said, it ain't 'owe'. This is my /job/. Here or in any other world,"" Hellboy says pointedly, turning to follow Magda out, his tail twitching behind him as he follows her. But he does leave her some parting words at the door, glancing back and giving a slight grin. ""Cum lux cadit, tenebrae praevalet. Shine a little, if you feel it's that important."" And then he's out the door, letting it clank behind him as it closes.


It's almost as if nature saw the corruption in Beacon Harbor, the very depravity that holds this city together... and nature has sent this rain, hard and cold and searing, to bleach all that sin away. It's a rain that does not even mollify for the few good hearts here, one of which sinks when her cigarette gets soggy. She's not as angry as she was a moment ago, though she almost wishes she were -- for this woman's bark is worse than her bite, and her vocal cords have been scraped. The moment the storm hit her, she could not be irritated any longer. She just stands there, getting soaked, rain pearling down the angles of her face and clumping her eyelashes. She flicks water away as she blinks, her eyes veering pointedly down at her poor, doughy cigarette. The soaked thing falls out of her lips, hits the pavement in a heavy smack. Magda just looks very put upon."

"event","Hellboy and Magda, now dealing with child at home, head to bar. Magda's been weird, Hellboy's been worried. However, with Koudelka already at the bar, this promises to get worse, not better.

<lj-cut text=""You are my demon lover, right?"">


The Crescent Moon is a good place to get in out of the rain and messy weather. Especially for someone who only occasionally goes home. Annie's become used to seeing Koudelka using this place as a sort of dry-off place, or hide-from-the-weather place. She can even generally tell when to get a mixed drink ready, or just to pass over a mug of beer. See, sometimes Koudelka wants to drink, and sometimes she wants to get _drunk_. Fortunately, tonight's just a 'drink' night, as opposed to a 'how pissed can I get on what's in my pocket?' night. The woman's got a frosted mug in front of her, sitting over by the fireplace, letting the warmth of the pub's fire kill some of the cold damp off her clothing while she works on getting dried out. Stupid, stupid ghosts. Always choose the worst times to coax her out of the nice, warm house and into the pouring-rain streets. LOVE-ly.


It is into this that Hellboy and Magda sweep -- the long, leather coat of the former lifted up as a rain-shield for the latter. Certainly, there's no reason to be chivalrous with these two; she's his landlady, he's her oversized tenant who sleeps on the floor while she takes the couch and that damn blonde punk takes the bed. But still, if anything, Hellboy was raised right -- thank God for small favors -- and does not want to see his companion soaked to the bone. She will catch a cold. He assuredly will /not/.

He ducks his head after he ushers her in from the rain, and then drops his coat back into place, smoothing his smaller, left hand down over his chest, across the blazing, gray symbol of the BPRD. He coughs, once, and then says, ""... Cute place. Not a whit English, but cute."" He's spent more time in English pubs then many Englishmen. (John Constantine excluded.) But he rubs the back of his neck, and then gestures for his companion to find a place to sit down, even as he drips his way over toward the bar, rolling out of his coat only because he knows if he doesn't hang it up to dry somewhere specified for it, someone's going to snark about water on the floor. It always happens to /him/.


Ever since one sunny afternoon fresh from a psychiatrist's office, Magdalen St. Matthew has been in an odd mood. Not acidic, not irritable, not even temperamental with the potential of small, impotent bursts of anger -- no, someone would need spirit for that. Hers seems to have been sucked right out. She sleeps a lot, drinks and stares placidly at things, and has said less words than she has fingers. Half of them being the docile, simple invitation of, ""Hit the bar?"" the moment she discovered she cleaned herself out of the scotch.

It's raining bricks out there, the night's colder than a witch's teat, but Magda triumphantly soldiers on.

A little too quickly, all the more eager to evade the icy downpour and take immediate sanctuary in the bar. Shaking herself out, giving her own damp bike jacket a smear, Magda pauses only to glance up at her tenant/cook/can opener/umbrella, the look on her face brief but appreciative. ""Thanks."" She peels out of her coat, picking at the humidity that tightens up her wrinkled, button-downed blouse, stretching it when she shrugs. ""Yeah. But it's quiet. That's what counts."" Her eyes stray, already magnetically attracted towards the fireplace. Warmth.


Hazy-eyed from thought, rather than the booze, Koudelka barely looks up for a moment as people come in. Then back down to her drink. Sip. Three... two... one... groggy mind finally processes what she saw in that glance. And Koudelka very nearly spits out the next drink she takes from the mug, looking up again, sharply and abruptly in a classic (albeit somewhat delayed) double-take. She has one of those expressions that practically embody the unspoken ""!!!"" of someone who just can't find the right words for the situation. Sure, Annie's hardly even batting an eye, just giving Hellboy the classic, ""What'll you have?"". She's used to this sort of thing. So's Koudelka, mostly... but she's learned that trouble comes in waves. And considering that she just dragged her butt out of work, she's expecting... well, if that guy starts blowing fire around the place, she wouldn't be all that surprised. Hellboy's not the only one who's had trouble with weirdness following them around, after all.


Tick, tick, tick.

Yes, someone finally had their freak out. Hellboy just glances over -- and if you knew him well enough you'd know that rocky face just smiled. ""Hey,"" is all he says, before he looks over to Annie, and flashes his left hand; ""Scotch. May as well give us the who whole bottle; I don't really get drunk on normal booze, and she's got a hefty tolerance."" He lets Magda wander toward the fireplace; he just watches her as he leans against the bar, rolling a small bit of cash out of his pocket while she does so. First bottle will be on him. Second bottle -- if they get to that -- will be on her. She can bitch at him about it later.


Perhaps he's not about to blow fire, but the woman he came in with looks close to spitting acid. On her way towards the hearth, not yet, she remembers something enough to stop her steps like a razorblade cuts a line of coke. Magda tosses a look over her shoulder, her curly hair slung, a petulant look thrust back. Apparently the other half of words she's spoken were telling him that she'd be paying. She gives Hellboy a slant look out the corners of her eyes as she gauges him at the bar, an expression that thankfully doesn't last long. He pays for enough already! Resigned most of all, she plops down to a cushy couch lining the fireplace, coat tossed over an arm, tilting her head to scrub at her damp hair with her knuckles. Magda peers curiously, wordlessly at Koudelka as she does so, and while she's not the initial chatterbox, she looks far from mean. Just sadly drinkless.


Yeah. Annie's seen this sort of thing before. She doesn't even bat an eye. She just reaches for the money, swapping Hellboy for the bottle. Good stuff, too. Not Expensive-with-a-capital-E, but real Irish. Yeah. Maybe the bar's not the slightest bit English, but she has pride in her choice of drinking liquids. The primary reason that Koudelka likes coming here: the drinks remind her of home, even if the atmosphere doesn't.

And speaking of our erstwhile medium, she's blinking owlishly at Hellboy, only barely noticing that there's someone else approaching the fireplace, and giving her a regard of her own. Hell, she's even barely noticing that Big Red just passed a greeting toward her, and she's looking right at _him_. Blink. Blink. Blink? Well, when the demon doesn't start ripping up the bar, and when Annie just casually serves him a drink, that seems to reassure Koudelka enough to get her out of the wide-eyed and overly-startled expression, toasting herself with the mug and murmuring, ""Beacon Harbor. Where demons drink in Irish Pubs."" in a rather sharp-edged tone. Stupid. Been here for how many years, and seeing a demon can still throw you on edge? Stupid. ... rather, about twenty years of 'training'. But still stupid. And yeah, plenty of room at the table near the fire. That, then, is when Magda's peer actually _does_ register. And before Koudelka takes the drink owed her by the toast, she returns the glance to the put-out officer. ""You've got odd taste in boyfriends.""


See Hellboy: 8:| 

See Hellboy happily taking his booze and turning around to greet Magda's slant look with a smile, because he got away with paying: 8:]

See Hellboy catch racist remark about his obvious heritage. Sigh. 8:[

See Hellboy catch the word 'boyfriend' come out of Koudelka's mouth: 8:O ...

Yeah, the big guy nearly dropped the bottle, and it's a good thing he didn't catch it with the RIGHT hand -- it cushions the bottle abruptly as he fumbles with his left, and closes the right around it's body, and then turns and LOOKS at Koudelka. ""Ya mind?"" he finally manages, unable to really find other suitable words. It's just all -- so -- well, yeah.


This woman's barely a lady, not by the way she sits sluggishly, casually, by the way she's trying to rub off the freezing rain that managed to hit her. She makes grumbly, irritated, she already told him she's going to be paying, damnit, sounds, bemusedly rubbing at the back of her neck. Magda glances up suddenly, eyeing Koudelka critically when she hears the woman's first comment. ""What're you calling him?"" she asks severely, sounding a little more defensive than she'd liked. Though rather unaware herself of her tenant's macabre roots -- despite all appearances -- she thinks Hellboy many things. Demon isn't one of them. Demons are bad things. Monsters. They steal souls. They work evil. They embody sin. They -- better not exist in this world. And even if they do, one of them he's most assuredly /not./

""Lady, you better not be calling him --"" Magda pretty much chokes on her saliva. ""-- My what?!""


Koudelka always knows _just_ what to say to get the best impression. Just ask Lorne. He'll be glad to tell you. _After_ he's finished laughing, of course. Neither one of the reactions particularly fazes Koudelka. She just slots a glance between them, looking at one, looking at the other, then, ""Far be it for _me_ to mind."" She turns all to casually back to her drink. ""I live with an _angel_, for God's sake."" No, she doesn't notice the irony in that choice of epithets. Or consider that using the word 'God' around someone who looks like a demon might be a problem. ""Far be it for _me_ to say anything."" Drink. ""And,"" she adds, though without looking up, ""you don't need to look at me that way."" Not that she's voicing _which_ look she means, of course. ""I'm off-duty. If you're just here to drink, far be it for me to interrupt. I called him a demon."" Yeah. She'll admit it. ""If I'm wrong, then I'm sure you're about to correct me. And if I'm right..."" Sip. ""... I've seen a lot of things in this city. As long as he's not trying to burn the bar down, or shoot a few things up. For all I know, he's a demon who fights demons. Considering Beacon Harbor? It wouldn't surprise me."" And it's all said with a caustic edge to her voice. Koudelka: not the friendliest bird around, really.


""People in this city amaze me,"" Hellboy says. Angels. Deigning to live on earth, with HER? But he patiently walks over to Magda while Koudelka snarks about, and simply shrugs, his eyes flickering over to her -- there's a ding on his mental radar; a shift, a phase a -- year. There. Right /there/. He smirks, then turns away. ""Lady, you got you own problems. I wouldn't suggest you snark about mine.""

It's to hide the flinch, really. He never, ever clarifies what he is -- demon, human, goat boy, taurean nightmare, alligator with issues, whatever. He just waves Magda to a booth closest to a fire, and sets the glass down on the table, and takes a seat, his tail curling against his legs as not to get in the way.


And cue Magda's long, very long bout of staring. She doesn't change the look on her face, the dumb, incredulous, slapped-on look since Koudelka inferred that she and Big Red were -- no. No no no. She slowly, haltingly accepts the drink without turning her eyes away, her stricken look souring by the second. She doesn't look enraged, not about to launch into fists and fury over the continued use of 'demon' -- one word the detective's already decided she doesn't like. Only looking as drained as she's been the past day, it gives her the slack to look tired, annoyed, and a bit disgusted, and she moves only to retrieve her coat. ""Yeah. For all you know. And it ain't much,"" she grunts back, if looking a little confused in the process. Magda rises, sidestepping to rearrange herself to the booth Hellboy has chosen.


""You and me both."" Koudelka directs toward Hellboy. ""But you get used to it. This city's full of weird-...""

The word 'weird' gets to act as a summoning, practically. Suddenly, *FWOOSH!* The fireplace the group is near suddenly flares into life. There's a sound mid-way between a cry and a laugh from the flames, before they gutter back down to a normal 'fire-style' fire. But the eruption hasn't completely passed. There's a presence in the room. One that's tangible, rather than seen. One that's not here just to rattle a few windows and steal a few glasses. Said individual has a destination in mind. And that destination? The nice, wide-open medium that's sitting right near the fire.

For a moment, Koudelka's eyes go wide as she *stares* at whatever it is that's coming toward her. Others can't see anything, certainly, but Koudelka... and for that matter, very possibly Hellboy... can see the charred husk of spirit that was once a human being. That is, for the brief moment that it exists outside in the real world. Because in the next moment, the phantom lunges for Koudelka, and the battle... well... is short and sweet. Damned lack of protection against these sort of things. Eyes, hazy, then snapping back into focus as the woman just *looks* over at Hellboy. And looks. And looks. And then *SCOOT!* goes the chair, and she practically catapults herself at him. ""You're *HERE!*"" And, well, the voice went from absolute deadpan, rolling with Romany tones and a Welsh accent, to... well, one of the locals. Accent completely gone. Gleeful. Utterly excited. Where've you been all my... uh... death?


And you know? It's the sad, warped preternatural calm that Hellboy takes this wall with. He wiggles the bottle and then realizes -- with the weirdness from the woman, he forgot the glasses. He sighs, rises -- and then blinks mildly. Oh. Look. Ghosts in the fireplace, and -- yes, coming at him in a borrowed body. ""You know,"" he says, even as he gets up, and realizes that Koudelka isn't herself, and puts a hand out -- the big red one -- to stop her lunge, ""I was beginning to get used to the idea of being a civvie. I even came out today without my gun. Never know when you're going to need to plug some possessed nutjob."" He grunts once, and then gives a little push to shoo away the possessed girl, and answers 'her' (him? it? whatever?), ""Ayup. I am. Isn't that special?"" And just like that, he walks past Koudelka, and goes to the bar, asking Annie there, ""Two glasses. And I apologize for any mess that may occur. I assure you -- I don't /ask/ for this stuff.""

And then, he just turns around quietly, and waits for his glasses, watching Koudelka-nee-Ghostperson with orange, impassive eyes.


It's the sad, warped, preternatural calm that Magda lacks, perhaps the only way she could remain rooted to her spot. Instead her jaw drops, and she immediately stands, almost up on her toes with the utter whipsnap quickness. ""What--?!"" It's half cop and half something else she's not even going to ask, all instincts to protect the guy who's -- got it pretty much under control. One would hope. The cop stalls from taking a step forward, her grey eyes all too confused, all too WHAT THE HELL to let the insanity of the moment seep past her. She doesn't sit back down, tense in case she may need to do something.


The hand does a good job of stopping Koudelka. The woman's not preternaturally strong, after all. Stopped in place, the possessed woman is... startled into stillness for the moment, giving Hellboy plenty of time to get to the bar and get his glasses. She's... well, shocked. _SHOCKED_! He... he just... by the time he's done his discussion with Annie, though, she's pulled herself out of it. The possessed woman strides firmly up to Hellboy, a determined look in her face, and reaches to try and take hold of his arm. Whichever one happens to be the closest, whether that's the big red one or the even bigger stone one. ""It is! I've been waiting for you for so long. Where have you been? Come on."" Like he should know exactly what she's talking about. ""I've been waiting for you to show up since the ceremony. And it's been so *long*. I don't think I could have waited much longer. Not without going insane."" Ahem. Too late? Magda? Magda _who_? Just some chick over in the corner, really. She's got better things to worry about!


Hellboy 's brows furrow, as she places her hands on the great, red stone arm -- which is oh, oh so warm to the touch. It shouldn't BE that warm, ever. No way. But he clinks the two glasses dangling from his left hand's fingers, and then says, ""Listen. I really don't like it when people talk about ceremony. I really don't. It makes my skin crawl. So, you really ought to l eave that body that isn't yours, before I have to get technical -- or worse, start with the exorcising. I really don't want to ruin a perfectly nice bar with having my first memory be an exorcism."" 

He moves from the bar then, drawing away from the woman's touch, to give Magda's the glasses. ""Pour,"" he says simply. ""And relax.""


""Relax, he says. Yeah. Relax,"" Magda spits back, a voice to match the uncertain look glazed over her face. ""Um, Red? Kinda notice the fifth -- wait, sorry -- sixth limb attached to you? What the hell's going on here? Why she suddenly on you like a fly on shit?"" She doesn't take the glasses, instead hooking her hands on her hips, fingers digging into the fabric of her jeans. She's confused as all hell, and she hates it when she's confused. She doesn't know what step to take, if it's even her step to take -- even if she sure as hell knows how to make them cease and desist. Real fast. Standing there, her sharp body rigid, she glares expectantly.


And because Hellboy told her to, the ghost goes away. ... Ok. No. It would have been easier, but ghosts are never that reasonable. Particularly not when they're possessing someone that can actually work physically for them, and that they don't particularly care if they break or not. Some ghosts just aren't the most polite things in the world. ""But..."" And the woman's voice actually manages to take on a plaintive tone. ""... I was looking for you. For so long. You _are_ the demon lover who was supposed to take me to Hell to meet my Master."" ... you _are_, right? ""Stop fooling around!"" Koudelka... is pouting. She's _pouting_ at him. Like he's just teasing her. Tee-hee. Silly boy. Doing her best to ignore Magda, too. Not important. Just some other person who wouldn't *understand* this whole thing. Really. Like the poor officer isn't even there. Very probably because she's talking to Hellboy and not Koudelka. ... understandably-so.


""She's possessed, Mags,"" Hellboy says with the patience of someone who's had to explain this sort of thing /a lot/. 

And then she goes and says that 'demon lover that takes me back to my master' -- and oh, his patience? It just sizzled up in like someone just dropped a match into a barrel full of gunpowder. It sizzles -- it does not explode, just... sizzles. His hand, the left one, reaches out to catch up Koudelka by the front of her shirt, and grab it tightly. ""Listen,"" he says in that deep voice that demands to be felt and heard all at once, ""I am no body's demon lover, and I am certainly not anybody's fetch-boy for some goddamn soggy bint who apparently doesn't know who she should and shouldn't give it up for."" It's said, low and controlled, but the anger is there. She just touched a nerve she probably didn't know he had.

He drops her then, his left hand sliding into his pocket; he fingers something; no, no, not that -- wrong shape, wrong feel, wrong chain -- aha. He draws it out then, and says, ""If you don't vacate that body and get the hell out, I'm going to MAKE you go somewhere you REALLY don't want to go.""


""Possessed?"" Magda barks back, despite the relief some part of her feels. More nutso weirdness. At least she's justified to confusion this time. ""By wha-- How'd you know?"" But the demand doesn't have long to linger on her teeth. Pale eyes turned, she doesn't really know why her hackles are up the moment the woman approaches. She's usually much more reserved about these things. ""OK. Ma'am? Think it's time to back off. Now. Before something --"" Like this happens. The poor cop, stuck on the sidelines... thinks she's probably better off there. But she's still a cop, and keeping the peace is part of the description. ""Hey, hey --"" she starts to utter the moment Hellboy takes both offense and Koudelka's shirt, her insides cringing at the thought of something happening.

Magda takes a step forward, stopping only -- and gratefully at that -- when his temper hasn't been broken. And then he starts talking about vacating bodies, and Magda's got that same old confused look, the one that looks like gut punch short of nauseated. She can only stare, arms held half-out."

"event","Magda and Hellboy speak after Magda 'recovers' from her latest bust. Hellboy attempts to keep Magda's mind off her problems. Magda asks personal questions, of a sort. <lj-cut text=""What do you remember?"">


Just because the electrician may have brought light and life slowly back to one-half of the condominium, it doesn't mean Magda has to like it. She prefers the dark, her candles, her crippling sanctuary from technology and electricity. They bathe the tiny place in a halo of reds and oranges, warmed hues beaconing like a light house and trying to bring the cold hearts home. A scratchy record player plays old Billie Holiday, and softly, gently, she croons the warm night away. The atmosphere is loose and languid like a jazz rhythm, like a stretching tabby, and the woman tries to indulge in it as much as she can. She's been a permanent fixture gargoyled on the middle of the staircase to the top floor, her lanky body spread out and head leaned against a wall. Almost protecting something that could be upstairs. In the meanwhile, she's indulged just a bit too much, enough that it's coaxed her into slumber. Magda sleeps. A cigarette hangs from her fingers, clenched there absently, the ash twisting up as the butt burns away. Smoke billows. A chunk of ashes rains into her glass of scotch, which glints from a step below her. They mix like things tend to do.


So long as they don't burn -- Hellboy wold prefer not to return home to flames... Besides, these days he's doing a little social drinking outside the house. Not that he can be called a lush for it; it barely touches him at all, the scotches and rums and whiskey sours. He sort of envies his nonmeta coworkers, who can get drunk, no problem, without faerie wine or the blood of the innocent or whatever else might manage to get HB plastered.

But when he comes home, dusty and still smelling of dry roasted peanuts, he finds the stairs strangely shadowed, and frowns, just a little. The phonograph's needle grinds against the label of the record, and he lifts it, carefully, and puts it on it's cradle, only to turn the machine off a second later. Then, he heads for the stairs.


She's gone. So gone. He sighs softly, and then kneels, slowly, down on the steps, careful of the smoldering cup-turned-ashtry. His human hand finds her neck, carefully, gently cupping her head even as his large, stone hand slips under her thighs and, without a hint of effort, lifts the small woman and begins to carry her down toward the couch. Stilly woman. Silly, silly, sad woman.


For the minute, her dormant head lolls back, like the way broken baby sparrows do after they've fallen from their nests, and candlelight paints morbid colours on Magda. Her neck is a ring of red and black, carved into it the shapes of fingers -- two circles burned onto either sides of her windpipe. The thumbs of a proper chokehold. Her right temple is a miserable bump, and bruises and scratches picasso up both her arms. No wonder she's out like a light.

For the longest of times, she's unresponsive, her body all but wanting to ooze into those unnaturally warm hands. It really isn't the touch itself that stirs Magda, odd as it is for a woman who prizes her personal space. Somewhere in her subconscious smells peanuts, and it's so unusual, so rare from her memories, so different that it could not wake her. Magda murmurs before her eyes even open, a raw sound leaving her, her voice airy like holes have been punched into it. ""Where...'m eun,"" she slurs out.


""You're going to lay down on the couch,"" Hellboy says gently, ""And you're gonna let me first aid you. And you're gonna sleep, and not go to work tomorrow. All right?"" He says this all in his low voice, more felt then heard, a rumbling, subsonic message that gently vibrates it's message through her cells rather then transmit the data through her ears. 

He lays her down, then, gingerly inspects her--there, there, and yes, there. All right. He'll tend to the hurts he can see, before he goes prodding about the hurts he cannot yet. Getting up, he goes to fetch the first aid kit, tail swishing behind him once he's away from the couch, an irritable tick-tock of her personal metronome.


With all that rumbling, those gentle words, her eyes just may never open. Magda is a listener, the very trait branded into her pedigree. There are always whispers sharing secrets, always voices there should she ever listen -- and she does. It is her purpose to listen. She's saved lives listening. And tonight, in these moments, she adds a bit of a luxury to her own to dangle there and listen. Her good ear knows it's Hellboy -- his voice has always been like wine to her -- before the rest of her mind wakes, and she mumbles a hoarse, but fond, ""Red.""

Then her eyes do open, cracks of grey peering at him glassily, deeply hooded. Her body yields to the couch, limbs still heavy with sleep, something that it takes them many minutes to dispel. ""'m sorry, Red,"" she rasps out, an odd thing to say, but the first words brought to life through her fuzzy brain. Talking feels like ripping new lacerations down her throat. It burns. And if that doesn't wake her up... Magda slowly pushes herself to sit up, one hand on her crown. ""What time'zit.""


""Late,"" Hellboy says gently, even as he comes down to sit with the kit, tsking. ""Need a good field kit in this house,"" he says, his tail curling up behind and flicking back and forth. But all the same, he gets antiseptic and some gauze. ""Just wanna take a look at these,"" he says shortly, and then dabs gently at the goose egg on her brow, antiseptic cleaning away what might've gotten into split skin, abraded flesh. ""So, who did you take on? Tyson take off his gloves and wanna make you his bitch, or what?""


And that truly wakes her up. ""Shit!"" she croaks out, flinching the moment the antiseptic burns its way into the cuts on her temple. The wound is as undressed as it is fresh: Magda's not the vessel of care when it comes to her own body. Reflex snaps her head back, trying to escape the stinging ministrations because, Christ, does that hurt. Brain quickly unfuzzing, one eye squinting as her headache sets in, the woman pauses to think, straining visibly before she answers, ""Less a th' want. Mor a th' did."" She swallows against her scratchy voice, adding quietly, ""Work. Money fight -- broke it up. They didn't like that.""



Hrumph. Hellboy allows her to flinches, then presses resolutely on, dabdabing at her brow carefully, before he makes her tilt her head back so he can simply examine her bruises. ""Tea, you'll need some tea for that throat,"" he says with a 'I don't care if you think tea is the devil's piss you'll be drinking it shortly' sort of tone. He's gone into caretaker mode, plain and simple. But he nods quietly. Money fight, yeah, ugly. Didn't like it? Well, duh, Lucy! What did you think they would do? ...He shakes his head, and then says, ""Lemme put the tea on,"" and rises.

Vanishing into the kitchen, Hellboy is quiet, working in quiet. Yes, he got tea. He likes tea. Some of his friends like tea, and he buys it out of habit. But it's there, in little packets, and soon water is hot and whistling, and bags are soaking. Chamomile. Yum.


The woman doesn't try to evade the gauze once more, perhaps too exhausted to do that. But her lip curls a little against the hot, ember-bright stings, like a good-natured animal that still wants to show that it doesn't like that. Though uncertain, Magda is generally pliant to his touches, trusting already for someone so short in another's acquaintance. Her eyes only close when she swallows, opening again to watch Hellboy rise from the couch. ""Who's takin' care of who now,"" she mumbles wryly after him.

Her body leans against the back of the couch, head pounding. She recloses her eyes and lets herself think, knowing there's something on her mind that she's not yet grasped. Something that happened that her sleepy mind still hasn't worked out. Tasting old scotch in her mouth, Magda remembers. She turns a look up the stairs and sobers almost instantly.


""It's what I do,"" Hellboy says. Whether with fists or a gentle hand on the wounded, he does what he does. But he gets a mug filled with the tea, and then brings it over, stirring a spoonful of honey within it, too cool and sweeten, just in case. He settles down before her, even as she looks up the stairs and get that /expression/; that flash of remembrance across her face makes him lift a brow, even as he holds the mug in his big, stone hand. ""I can never tell if this is too hot, so you just let it cool, all right?"" But then he glances up the stairs, and then asks, simply, ""What?""


Glancing back, her eyes fix first on the proffered cup of tea, before lifting up on the man that bears it. It's been years since Magda's had tea, though she's not really thinking about that now, reluctantly taking the cup to heat her hands. She doesn't sip from it, bending up a knee to set it there while she composes herself. Hellboy's question shuts her up, and as if she isn't discoloured enough, a flush creeps up into the woman's vealy face. He's teased her about it, so it might be reason herself to admonish herself for admitting this. ""There's...somebody up there,"" she reveals scratchily. ""For tonight. She's hurt a bit."" She pauses. ""She was in the fight. They're putting bets... she's so little.""


This time, both brows rise. She -- again -- it -- oh, God save him.

""Magda, you picked up another stray? This one -- who quite possibly, willingly -- entered criminal fights?"" He just -looks- at her for a long moment, and then sighs, settling his chin in his stone hand. And he thought HE was an effin' bleedin' heart, red from the fact he'd bled so much for so many people, who, half the time, didn't want his help anyway. He's met his match, already, and it's drivin' him nuts. Did Abe feel like this, ever? Wanting to smack him for taking a shine to the new guy, or helping the latest freak get their feet? ... Maybe. Maybe. 

He grunts, his eyes half-lidding, slightly luminescent in the dim light. ""You're a piece of work, Magdalen St. Matthews, you really are."" But all the same, the words are uttered with fondness. Idiot woman.


Her eyes fall away, diverting beneath the look he gives her. Not because she is sheepish, but because she understands. She understands completely. Criminal fights -- and then some. Magda knows she's only scratched the surface concerning that little girl asleep upstairs, and her heart is broken already. It makes her feel sick inside to know what knows on, and know how badly she wants to fix it. ""It's probably just for tonight,"" she says again, staring at her tea instead of drinking it. ""She needed someone. She'll be OK.""

Her eyes raise back up when he says her full name; there's no better word to grab Magda's attention. Though she doesn't smile, never smiling, she breathes out sharply, transparently amused. She leans her cheek to her couch, and the cop who bodily put down a two-hundred pound man only hours ago -- she looks so damn small. She's exhausted. She's sore. She's a living, breathing headache. She's oddly not in one of her moods. After watching Hellboy for a short while, her ragged voice speaks up, ""Talk to me."" She finds it soothing when he does. ""Tell me about...something. Anything.""


""I shouldn't tell you one of my strange work-stories,"" Hellboy decides after a few minutes under that gaze. ""You'd laugh, and it's hurt. Uhm. Hmm."" He considers, speaking aloud because he wonders if she'd really care about any topic -- probably not, he surmises. Instead, his tail flicks back and forth. ""Huh. Since I know where you came from, figure I may as well tell you where I came from."" It's something to talk about, and a story he doesn't mind telling. ""My father always told the story better -- if you ever want to listen to his tapes, I've got them. He kept... a recorded journal of my life, his life, everything that happened since my 'birth'."" It's a generous offer -- he'd let few people hear Trevor Bruttenholm's voice. ""Anyway -- it was England, 1944. December. This team of investigators, parapsychologists, they're out studying a church in East Bromwich; Lady Cynthia Eden-Jones has lead a team of American and English soldiers there, claiming something's bigs gonna happen. And they wait and wati, and -- bam. Suddenly, they're getting all poo-poo, when two ghosts are sited; a nun and a priest. They start freakin' out, and outta no where, this flame erupts... and then, Trevor -- my dad -- he just says, ""It's a little... hellboy."" He grins slightly. ""Bam. Birthed and named in the same minute.""


As soon as that voice starts, Magda relaxes. She lets her fatigued body curl into the couch, every muscle in her body loving her for this temporary exorcism; tension seems to forever possess this woman. Yet by the looks of her now, it's a wonder she doesn't fall asleep on the spot. Frankly, she would, if not for her interest. It's no surprise that she's insatiably curious about Hellboy, to the point of a prompting, ""Yeah?"" when he mentions the existence of those tapes. Damn right she'd love to hear them. But, for now, he's the snake charmer and she's the sated cobra, listening and not talking. It's what she likes to do. Every so often, she sneaks a crooked look down at her tea, not quite trusting it because there's no shot of mickey. Only when it pains her further to swallow, she takes an experimental drink, and ends up hooked. Damnit. Her pale eyes peek up in time to catch Hellboy's grin at the last bit of his story, her head tilting into the couch cushion as she examines him. And here come the questions. ""That's how you're named? Ghosts? --Do you remember that far back?""


""Nothing, really."" He says slowly, considering. ""I -- I would see them later in life, but not until .. oh, 50 years later. I went back, after my father was killed. I loved England, and Ireland -- lots of good things came out of the Kingdom for me."" Ana, the church, a lot of work and friends... He could go on and on. But he says nothing of it, weaving his low-voiced stories with simple succinctness. ""I wasn't really a baby; I was most like.. a toddler. Still, my memories are ... nothing. I don't remember anything, really, in the first year. Then I begin to remember a lot. I grew up in Roswell, first couple years of my life. They had aliens there, and part of Project Manhatten. Einstein and Oppenheimer. I knew them as a child -- Einstein played checkers with me, and promised to teach me chess when I was older."" He smiles at the memory -- does this place have Einstein and Oppenheimer? For all that the bomb caused so much sorrow, he hopes, still, these men existed here. THey were good to him.

""My father went back and forth between the states and England for awhile, trying to figure out where I'd come from. Nine years, he never did find anything out about the place. Funny, huh? But ... It was weird. But -- yeah. That's all. I grew up in fatigues, with Mac the Base Dog. Pretty sure, as a kid, that I thought he was the higher being of the base."" He doesn't mention other things, though -- things he keeps quiet, does not talk about, does not care to remember. He's simply letting her drag her fingertips across the water of his story, dabble her toes in the shallows; he does not take her where the water goes deep and black.


Ghosts. Aliens. Roswell. Beings of folklore. Gods of myth and legend come to life. Magda's sure skimming one goddamn pool of water. She's alert, despite her hooded eyes and loose, strewn limbs, indulging more and more in her tea with growing appreciation. It seems to hit her, all at once, like a hard slap of thankfulness. It's a feeling she doesn't know, not intimately, that she's so utterly grateful for every bit of this, that she's got a couch, tea, company -- and how much better it is than feeling sick to her stomach on the staircase. She's somewhat pleased to realize that she's just emotionally stunted, and not completely retarded. ""You--"" she starts to say, though she harshly catches herself. Not up on socialization, Magda was just about to ask Hellboy how his father was killed. Best way to celebrate feeling grateful than digging up a guy's worst memory. Rubbing a little bemusedly at her throat, as though a little pain should smarten her up, she can barely believe herself at times. ""Your -- what you do remember. What's your favourite memory?""

Hellboy looks over, tilting his head quietly, and blinks once, then twice. ""I -- I really couldn't tell you,"" he says slowly. ""It's hard to pick. I -- I've lived a rough and tumble life, and I've had more then my fair share of crap shoveled into my lap. I've seen some weird, scary things. But -- shit, I've done a lot of fun, happy things too."" He considers, then, thought, scratching at his stubbly crown, where the hair grows sparse and wiry. ""Childhood -- when I was ... ten? twelve? I was ... really grown up. Physically, pretty much an adult. But I'd lived my whole life on a base, or a research facility. Never really got out much. Then, one day -- sometime before I turned.. twelve, I think, my dad, he comes in and says, ""Hellboy, we have a treat for you today... We're taking you off the base. We're going to go out, like father and son."" And -- this was a big deal. We'd... he'd officially adopted me when I was six or so, a little after they officially gave me human rights. But we'd never really done a lot together, beyond tests and research and ...scatter homelife crap."" He grins slightly, and then says, ""So to have this big secret outting come up -- even though I'm nearly two feet taller then my dad and three feet broader! -- it's a big deal. I'm like a kid, all of a sudden. And we get into a base truck, and we go out -- not to the city, but nearby. The amusement park; you know the kinda, that were all over in the fifties? Like Coney Island, back when Coney Island wasn't all drug dealers and bullshit."" He grins, then, his eyes distant, far away. He can smell the desert hair now hinted with butter and popcorn. ""Couple of other agents brought their kids, and they had a day -- but there were so ew of us, and we were spread so far out -- it was basically like me and my father had the park to ourselves. Thrill rides, candy, games. I don't know where he got the money, how, or ... well, I know /why/, but..."" He laughs, then, rich and deep, and says, ""It was the first and last time I really got to be a kid and not the base bratling. It was really great.""


Finished with her tea already, she moves the emptied mug to hold between her ankles, her bare feet with their crooked toes absently snagging and plonging on the handle. Magda curls up, drawing in her arms to cross and draw around herself, shifting only while wary of her burning throat. She tries not to worry it while tentatively resting her chin to the cradle of her shoulder, every inch of her tucked into place. She relaxes and listens, letting the images to come off his story replace her day's events and take her places. And wherever her mind's eye decides to go, it leaves a bit of an aftermath: there's a faint upturn of Magda's lips, hitched up in one corner. The story is just way too sweet. Ghosts. Aliens. Creatures. Ferris wheels. Somehow, it fits. ""That's your favourite one, huh,"" she asks quietly, idly, though without much softness to be found in her granity, gutted-out voice.


""One of 'em -- that one's ... yeah, just goodness all over. You know. There are other things, that made me really happy, are good to look back on. Abe, out of his tank and looking at me over his first ham sandwich, Liz, sixteen and making sure she damn well got a prom somehow... You know. Just .. things that make me glad that I was there to see them, if anything else."" He grins slightly. ""Abe, Liz, Kate, Roger... they're probably my best friends. Strangely enough, I get along a lot better with women then I do with men. Abe and Roger being the exceptions to the rule -- Bud, too, when he was alive."" He smiles slightly. ""I named pulled Abe from his tank. I gave Liz a lollipop. I gave Roger his name."" He grins, then and adds, ""It's all pretty good, I think.""

His tail curls around his thigh, tip flicking upwards only to relax again. ""I don't much care for my world and a lot of what's in it, sometimes, but I'm definitely gonna miss quite a few of it's people,"" he admits slowly, thinking on it. He cants his head slightly, pursing his lips together, and then adds, ""It's gonna be weird, without 'em. I'm used to adaptin' quick, and I've always felt better about workin' alone... but still, I was there for most of their lives. It's weird to have them not a part of mine."" He moves his chin from his hand, stretching his arms above his head, muscles pulling tight, only to relax against as he sets his palms on the carpet, and leans his weight back on them, careful not to press to hard -- he doesn't want to leave serious dents in the carpet."

The single gleaming eye of the moon casts a disapproving stare down on the world. All is in greys and blacks and faded whites, neutral colours of the dull side of the city. It's a skanky side of Beacon Harbor's Elm Hollow, the crooked fingers of it that stretch towards the tracks. The streets are rough and straight, tunneled in by broken buildings that leer close. The light of the moon is strong, but it barely bathes these corridors with its glow. It knows better than to look around here. There is no sound but that of silence -- live silence, loaded silence... charged.

That Magdalen St. Matthew shrugs off her shoulders, chuffing to herself as she walks along. She's taken to smoking outside ever since the kid came into her place, and soon enough pointless lingering down her drive-way has turned into lonely night walks. She doesn't mind. She treasures the quiet when she can, even if being left to her thoughts makes her moodier than shit. The night packs a sharp, crisp chill, and she tucks herself into her leather jacket that drapes as sloppily as the rest of her clothes. Do or damn, it's even the way she walks, the way she glances at things, the way she lets her smoke dangle suicidally off her bottom lip.


The clop-clop, were there two more feet to be added to the mix, would sound like a horses gentle approach. But there's only two feet, clop-cloping on the sidewalk, down the way, a long coat fluttering with the gentle night breeze, as Hellboy makes his way 'home'. It's a good enough time as any. He went out. He worked. He went out to drink with the boys afterwards, finding the crew genial, and while somewhat wary, it seems a requirement that he must Drink With The Boys or basically loose his job if he alienates them. And who is he to turn down liquor, really?

Still, he has his own cigarette, his coat, and his money, and new... well, he's not sure he' call 'em friends. THey kept looking at him funny, throughout their 'social hour'. But... it's enough. 

He can't see Magda -- the bright cherry of her cigarette is a moving dot, though, and there, a glimpse when she passes under a tree. He doesn't call out, though -- she'll notice him soon enough.


The quiet chill of the night air is disrupted about thirty yards ahead of St. Matthew by the sudden shattering of a bar window, and the immediate defenestration of a three hundred pound bearded drunkard, bouncing unceremoniously off the sidewalk and rolling to a stop in the street, quickly starting to bleed. A beat and a half after that, another figure comes through the window - a muscular but trim physique, clad head-to-toe in red and black, but also wearing a fuzzy brown poncho and a giant yellow sombrero. Trained cops will notice he's also strapped with two swords on his back, knives strapped to his calves, and two big holsters on his hips.

""Chubmaster Chunk! You are hereby charged with two counts of shittin' where you eat, three counts of crossing the wrong motherfucker, and forty-five separate counts of sweating through white t-shirts with yellow pit stains after Labor Day. Not to mention the extreme likelihood of several million counts of various insect life growing in that Ted Kaczinsky scruff of yours."" A pause as he strolls over and sinks a foot into the soft, gooey belly of the dazed fat man. ""Man, say what you will about old Eunice-bomber, but he sure made going out to the mailbox like emptying a box of Cracker Jacks, huh? Am I right, Kemoflabby?""


Unfortunately, this may be the single time in St. Matthew's volatile life that she doesn't notice someone seven feet tall, hooved, tailed, and impossibly red.

There's something else on her mind.

She drops her cigarette at the crash, standing there, taking the full brunt of the scene like a baseball to the head. The quiet night goes out like a fart, and like a slap, Beacon Harbor's insanity comes bounding in like Lassie come fuckin' home. There's a click, and fast a whipcord, Magda's gone all quickdraw. She stands there stiffly, shoulders level and arms straight, the rest of her as forgiving as a brick wall behind her pointed gun. She doesn't look amused. This was supposed to be her night. She squints at the mook in the sombrero, trying to repress already just what she's seeing. He's in a costume. This isn't happening. ""Hey. Now that just wasn't smart, Speedy Gonzalez. Not smart at all. BHPD. Let's see those hands, por favor.""


Hellboy is not a trained cop -- he's the best damn paranormal investigator that ever walked the earth (Eat your heart out, Mulder). But still, he's got FBI training and more then plenty experience; the whackjob with the sombrero and the ... wow. The arsenal. ""Hoo boy, this place just cannot get /any/ weirder, can it. However, he hears Magda's voice ring out over it all, even as he says to himself, ""What the /fuck/?"" Yeah. Whacko with way to many weapons. Magda's armed, but not that armed. Time to go to work.

Hellboy does not stop -- or even speed up his approach. He just clop, clop, clops his way forward, rolling his right arm in it's socket with an audible pop. Ah, violence. He's gonna get him some of that, and work out some serious frustration from the last week. But he stops just about fifteen feet back from Speedy and his bloody buddy -- the Soul Anchor probably won't do that schmuck any good, alas -- he's already gutted and damn near bled out. A shame. But it'll make beating his murderer till he's black and blue all the better. 

He doesn't say anything; only lifts his left hand, takes his cigarette out of his mouth, and flips it away; it sizzles in the puddle alread spreading in pulsing, horrible speed from the bearded fatman, a lesser known and far more common exhibit then the bearded fatlady.


Sombrero Lad almost doesn't even notice that he's got a gun pointed at him. He's enjoying the game of 'how deep into this guy's gushy belly can I sink my boot before I can't pull it out again?' Chubmaster is still very much alive, but too terrified to really speak. There's a lot of blood in him to bleed. It takes a few moments, but Deadpool finally pushes the giant hat back on his head a little bit, making his red mask with the black circles a little more visible, and he looks up to the cop lady with a bit of surprise. ""Will ya look at that. Someone's actually tryin' to play the good cop. That's cute, sweet cheeks, but I'm on the job here. I'm sure there's a pinstriped suit-wearin' mook somewhere with a C-note dangling from a fishing line that you can follow around while Daddy's workin', okay? And take your Budweiser Clydesdale with you, will ya?"" Oddly enough, this wouldn't have been the first time Deadpool's not noticed a seven-foot-tall red, hooved, tailed thing, but hey, the big hat blocks the peripheral a little. He does, however, finally turn Hellboy's way, and just stops cold for a moment. ""Oh. My. God."" A beat. ""Sancho! Sancho Pizza! You brought my bongoes! And you're wearing them on your forehead!"" He claps up a rhythm. ""C'mon, Mr. Tally Man! Tally me banana! Let's get some Vida Loca goin' up in this bitch, all right?""


""Who's playin'?"" she grits back, each word fired out of Deadpool making that one vein flare farther and farther from her temple. The cords tighten in her neck from her clenched jaw, fingers pressing momentarily tighter around her gun. She strafes a step closer, far from impressed, her gun levelled surely at the ass in the red bodysuit. ""Now, you listen to --"" her words that would much rather die out. Magda tucks her chin, visibly appalled at Deadpool's sudden burst into song, her eyes twitching over to seek the source of it. Surprise drains the anger out of her face when she finally spots Hellboy. Red? What's he doing here? Why -- not now. Ask questions later. After the bastard's in cuffs and a muzzle, and the poor bleeding schmuck's not likely to hack up his vitals. Her voice snaps up like a door slamming, and the five-foot police officer tries to command obedience. ""Count of THREE. Gonna get your fruity leotard ass off that guy, and put your hands up. Before I make you. You're under arrest.""


""Even brought my beatin' hand for those bongoes, Senor Sombero,"" Hellboy replies lightly, bringing up his stone hand to snap along with Tally Man over there, creating a grating crunch, crunch, crunch noise that really doesn't sound right, even as he slides his left hand into the pocket. If Flabbo there is still twitching, there's a chance. He finds what he's looking for -- a shiny rock. All it needs is a touch of blood, and ol' Chunky there has it all over. He gives it a flick toward the guy's chest, helpfully spattered with the red and sticky stuff.

""Work? Eh, seems like your job's done, man. That guy isn't going to live -- even if she gets you hogtied with bungee and bailing wire, and gets an ambulence here /right now/. Look at the puddle he's makin'."" He shrugs, then, and then suggests, ""Why don't we split this shit, and go back to the bar, huh? Chunky there looks plenty bled out, an' I bet the lady in blue will have a nice death report to handle. Besides, I'm bettin' you'd rather get shitfaced and dance to salsa then play cops and robbers, sans the robbers."" 

He's a meta, Hellboy rationalizes. He's got to be. No body looks at Hellboy without either having cohones of chromed steel or being two bananas short of a bunch, or power of their own. He's not sure which ol' Sombero is here, but he's betting on the latter, with a hint of the two former. So, a meta -- and a meta with balls of steel or no brains. Or both. Balls FOR brains, which is NEVER a good thing. 

He glances over The Great Hatola, and shakes his head once at Magda. Don't do it. Bad idea. Instinct tells him suffering will happen here.


Deadpool listens to One Good Cop and Giant Red Thing try to talk him off the contract in their own inimitable styles, glancing between the two of them, momentarily trying to piece together just what this bongo-headed monster might be about, but making no effort as yet to extricate himself from Chubmaster Chunk. ""Sorry, kids, but I've got the 'hogtying my fruity leotard ass with bungee and bailing wire' thing scheduled for tomorrow night, and it's really an all-night kind of affair, you see. Top dollar, high class, you know. Just a shiny mask and a metric ton of pretension shy of the 'Eyes Wide Shut' kinda vibe. So maybe you two Fair-To-Middling Samaritans can play your reindeer games with each other, and let me be, capisce? You know what I mean, Sancho? You get her drunk enough, I bet she might just loosen up enough to go home with Underbite Smurf - no, wait, you're red. Guess that makes you a Snork, then, huh? Sorry 'bout your luck."" Then a turn to Magda. ""As for YOU, Honey Bunches of Grit and Grimy, you'll never get anywhere by playing counting games with... me..."" He trails off suddenly, as his eyes go wide.

He tenses up as he looks at Magda, and he gets a flash of memory. ""Christ on a cracker..."" he mutters, as 2 and 2 slam rather forcefully together, and the guns come quickly out of his holsters. ""GOO LADY! GOO LADY! YOU'RE THE GOO LADY! YUCK YUCK YUCK GOO LADY!"" He reaches up and tosses his sombrero sharply toward Magda, hopefully to blind her - it's big enough to flop over her, or at least delay her. A spin to Redman as he backpedals away from her. ""Look out, Sancho! She's one of those Venom symbiote psychos that calls herself 'we' and likes to beat people to death with their own disembodied limbs!"" A beat. ""But in a BAD way!""


The officer of the law can't help it: she moves her grey eyes off her target, just enough to shoot Hellboy one of her most incredulous stares. He wants to take an armed, violent man, caught red-headed -- no pun intended -- with assault charges already out the wazoo out for a hey buddy drinking session?! Her lip curls. She's the law here, she's the one making demands, she's the one taking control, she's the one... not quite noticing Deadpool's gone for his guns until a heartbeat too late. She spits out a curse, her gun aiming, her finger twitching for the trigger, but any shot she had intended all goes to hell when the sambrero kicks her in the face. With a surprised shout, she viciously tears it off, her revealed face a twist of fury. Ruffled and recoiling, the look about her like some avenging angel, Magda meets his guns with hers, yet unfiring, but prepared to in this showdown. She's snarling as soon as she can, wanting the bastard's attention as much as wishing he'd do as he was told, ""GUNS DOWN! NOW!""


""Goo lady?"" He considers this thoughtfully, and then sighs. This is getting nowhere. Victim is soul-anchored, guy is waving guns. Guns don't bug him much. He sighs and then says, ""Well, shit. And here I thought she was a cop. And you're telling me she's actually a vicious serial killer in disguise. Well, and here I was gonna try and help ya out. Ah well."" He shrugs slightly- and then puts up his big, right hand. ""Guess we're gonna have to play football. Magda, do yourself a big favor and get outta the way.""

Cause Hellboy? Football is his favorite sport. He plays it well. And with his one hand up and froward, his left tucking down and sliding toward his belt, which has been turned to hide the massive weight of the Samaritan on his hip, he begins to charge. ""And we go for a line right down the middle."" Yeah. He's just gonna take the shots fired. If there are any. Not like they'll do more then itch and bleed, much like a venreal disease.


Deadpool is not backing down from this showdown. ""NO WAY! YOU'RE guns down! Since when does Crazy Goo Lady go around enforcing the law, anyway?!"" He keeps his eyes traind on Magda, but not firing, lest he provoke the goo. ""I'm tellin' ya, Sancho, last time I saw Bitchcakes here, she was leaping at me and telling me she was gonna rip me into forty-seven pieces - called herself Icky or Inky or Ichabod or something - and then suddenly it was REALLY freakin' dark, and my mind went blooey. Crap in a hat, I didn't stop dreaming about hillbilly Teletubbies for weeks and - "" Then a turn to Hellboy. ""Hey, dude! That's what you are! You're a big red Teletubby!"" Then a quick turn back to Magda - no taking eyes off her. ""Don't worry, though, Senor Pizza, the red one isn't the gay one. That'd be the Cajun one with the pink armor and the bendy javelin like Lamar from 'Revenge of the Nerds' who just happens to claim he's in love with the one girl he doesn't actually have to touch. He ain't foolin' NOBODY. And NEITHER ARE YOU, Itchy! I don't know what kinda Ass 2 Ass games you're playing with Glen or Glenda, but count me RIGHT the fuck out, okay? I've got better things to do tonight than bleed rectally!""

Somehow, he didn't expect the friendly beer-buddy ape whose back he was actually trying to watch to try and charge him. ""Football? What are you, Lucy Van Pelt? I'm tellin' you, La-La, she's a psychopath! She may have been able to get the fancy tattoo-removing surgery, but she's nuttier than that last hunk o' delight I left in the toi-"" WHAAAMMMM!!!!! No. He didn't expect that, barely had time to try and jump with it, and is utterly unprepared for the power behind it. The merc is off his feet and sailing back toward the bar, this time crashing through the wall with great fanfare, collapsing into a heap behind the bar, only to be instantly showered with many, many falling hooch bottles.


Though she does not breathe a word, this neither the time nor the place, moment by moment her lips are tearing back from her jaws. Magda bares her teeth in planted, gestating, through-the-ribcage rage that she can barely swallow back. She's not a serial killer. She's not a mass murderer. She's not goo lady. She's not itchy. SHE IS NOT MARLEY. She can taste the bile in her throat, tinny like sucking on a penny, and it's the only thing that keeps her mind sure on the situation. That and the potential it has to go all to hell. Her gun doesn't waver, her eyes honed like two sharp glints of shrapnel, everything focused on Deadpool while her mind continues to reel. Not many people around. She might be able to twist away from at least one shot while taking him down. And, goddamnit, Red, stop talking, you're going to get yourself hurt... ""Put the MOTHERFUCKIN' GUNS DOWN!"" Magda rips back, patience snapped, her good cop hidden by bad words. ""DO IT NOW--""

And he does. Or, at least, Magda watches something of Deadpool get put down the moment that Hellboy goes all offensive tackle. It barely even registers to her as her eyes follow the sailing bodies -- but she knows enough to cringe the instant they take out the wall.


Stomp, stomp, stomp. Yeah, the Budweiser Clydsdale HAS arrived, RIGHT through the wall of the bar. ""I hate collateral damage,"" Hellboy sighs, even as he lifts one hoof to plant it in the middle of Deadpool's chest, his eyes narrowing slightly. ""And I really don't like freakjobs who are not smart enough to take the easy, short fight, and instead, wig, freak their cheese, and start with the weaponry. Now, if I were you, I'd start with the peaceful surrendering of weapons--""

Click. Chack. The big gun is out. Samaritan is cocked, loaded, aimed.

""--Cause THIS one makes really big holes. I'm not the best shot, sparky, but you? You ain't movin' much."" He doesn't look away from his target, his tail lashing behind him. ""Now. See, shouldn't you have gone for that beer rather then point guns at my landlady? Goo, indeed.""


Deadpool feels a heavy bottle of Cuervo smash over the back of his skull. He's torn up and bleeding now, but not nearly as profusely as Chubbykins was. ""Uuuuuuunnngggg... anybody get the number of that ever-lovin' blue-eyed Thing?"" he babbles, dazed, until the sight of demon leg about to stomp him down spurs his instincts into action, and he rolls away before getting pinned dead to rights. He's still rolling through shards of glass, though, and he's not moving very fast. ""See..."" he coughs, spitting some blood into his mask, and thus having to taste it immediately again. Maybe an accident, maybe a weird habit. ""You AIN'T me, Cuddles..."" He manages to get to his feet, taking stock of everything that's aimed at him. ""You're a blind-sidin' giant jellybean thing with a tail that..."" A moment. ""Good gravy, man, *koff* would you believe I didn't put the whole 'demon' motif together until right now? *koff* Sorry, I know you probably worked really hard at getting the right balance between devil man and 'average joe who loves a good brewski.' *hack* Cute gimmick, works for you. If you can light a stogie with your finger, you got a career in Vegas. *thpppt-ack*""

He pulls a shard of glass out of the back of his neck. ""Anyway, as much as I'd rather not ever have heard the phrase 'freak the cheese,' which, really, Sancho, is probably a fetish website I really don't want you to explain to me..."" One might notice the bloodflow from his wounds is slowing surprisingly quickly as he backpedals casually over the shards. ""If Ooooh-Ooooh Itchy Woman is your landlady, you best not be late with the rent, and don't never call her to fix the plumbing, cuz she'll probably take whatever the hell she pries loose from the pipes and add it to her weird slimer friend. Ain't that right, Drano-Lady?"" A beat. ""Oh, and, uh, enjoy the earth-shattering kaboom."" With that, he dives back over the bar and out the window in a tuck and roll, expecting to be shot, and preferring it to being that close to the grenade he left beneath the mounds of shattered hooch bottles, with the pin still snugly around his finger.

Left in the wake of the dusting hole in the wall, still outside, the first matter at hand is Magda's quick dash to the poor, shitkicked drunk. With quite the grimace, though eyes worried, she reaches to check his pulse and snap the fingers of one hand to check for life. Thank God. She's no night nurse herself, but she knows well enough to order, ""Don't move one bit. I'm gonna call the meds, so keep down."" And with that, cursing up her own storm, she rises immediately to go right for the bar, entering it through the hole punched into the wall. The entrance itself is already swarming with the one-or-two greasy hooch hounds that have enough sense and sobriety to get the hell out. She's the only one going in, knowing the threat needs to be taken out before anything else. Wishing her left arm for her truck, for her radio to call this nasty in, she charges in after, more concerned than someone should be for a guy that's seven feet and solid muscle and stone hand. It's unfortunate that Magda only gets the tail end of the exchange, her cavalry of grey eyes to glock 17 drawing to a complete halt the moment she sees the bastard take a header right out the window. She stops and squints, frustration forcing the breath out of her. ""What the hell--?""


""Love my stogies, but alas, I do need a lighter,"" Hellboy says, training his gun on ol' rolly polly Deadpool as he goes his way out of the hooch-puddle. OH, Chivas Regale, we -- knew you weren't in this dive of a bar, but we knew you well. But he shrugs slightly as he considers the man's words, and shrugs. ""My name's friggin' obvious, but I didn't exactly offer it. Still, demon is such a racist term, don'tcha think?"" 

But he's watching him, watch -- oh, fuck. ""Nice to know I'm not the only man who goes prepared with grenades. Oh, armory, I miss you so..."" But even as he's sayin' this, he's turning to find Magda -- and oh shit, Magda! Squishy, human, explodable Magda. ""You have shit timing, you know that?"" he asks, before he barrels over like an oncoming train, to try and catch her up one armed and haul ass out, only to dump her back to her feet and grab the wounded man before he says, ""Fire in the hole! C'mon, move to cover! Get infront of me!"" and ushes her foreward -- his body (And meatman) acting as a shield behind her.


Deadpool is utterly surprised he made that break for it without taking any bullets, and it's not until he's heels over head in a flip that he looks back and catches Goo Lady in the bar as well. ""Bonus! Two-for-one deal at Piggly Wiggly!"" Then comes the big BOOM! Nothing C-4 level or anything that bad, but significant kaboom for the size of the grenade. More windows shattered, a good fire starts up, shrapnel digging into Hellboy's back - even Deadpool takes a little bit of it as he hits the ground rolling, skidding a little on the pavement and tearing off the shoulder of his costume - and a good chunk of his shoulder. Ow. He gets up quickly this time, though, to take advantage of the distraction and chaos, and stuttersteps back over to Chubby Lumpkins, quickly dragging him away from the blast radius before Hellboy can get to him, letting him concentrate on protecting Goo Lady, and he starts pressing the gun barrel against his forehead and looking at him upside-down. ""Sorry about this, Porthos. You were really supposed to suffer a lot more. I was gonna make you do sit-ups and ab-crunches and everything, but since Monkeyman And O'Bonkers have gummed up the works, I'll have to make this quick. Word to the wise, Plumpernickel. You don't settle a financial dispute by doing that kind of twisted shit to his nephew. He had enough trouble surviving altar boy training - he didn't need your shit on top of it. You're a waste of Fallopian effort, you sick sack of ass, and nobody will miss you. Nobody's ever missed you in your entire life. Die on that."" The gun doesn't go off, but rather, he lifts it up and crunches the whole thing into the front of Chubby's teary-eyed, bloody, screaming skull, caving it in and silencing it quickly, before yanking his brain-smudged fist back out of the mess. Ugh. It's never as cathartic as it's supposed to be.


""Hey!"" Magda only has time to yell, her eyes widening as Hellboy reprises his offensive tackle. ""He's going that --"" Way. Slung up like a pillow, nearly dropping her gun in the process, her brain's a whirl up until the moment she's deposited back to the dark outdoors. Trying to get her bearings, she whips around at her tenant-turned-shield, squinting up at him, asking in confusion, ""Fire in the WHAT?""

The explosion nearly bowls her over. Blood draining out of her, a sharp breath spitting out of her like a bullet out an exit hole, the woman stares madly as the bar sprays itself out by the concussive blast. Hellboy's probably the only reason she's not playing pin cushion to glass and splinters of wood. ""You OK? Where--"" she blurts out during the aftershock, her eyes already gauging this way and that. She catches a glimpse of something that'll probably be giving her nightmares for the next week, a surge of desperation snapping Magda back to life. She sees Deadpool rise up from the literal ashes, the blown lain down on the poor man, and she acts. Immediately in a crouch, gun out, eyes sharp, Magda opens fire. She's a terribly good shot, and a fierce one, attempting to plug a few shoots at his gun-bearing shoulder.



Well, now magically unburdened of dead guy -- and stopping shot of just about everything in the last pose, we reset:

Hellboy, having dropped Magda, acts as human shield. But she acts faster then he does while Deadpool does his dirty deed, and he stays put to allow her to shoot, apparently oblivious to the fact that his coat just got a weeeeeee bit hashed. ""I miss my grenades. Used to have a bunch. Used all the last of 'em though, before I made it here,"" he comments idly as he hears the richoet of her glock bark off fire. Still, he doesn't move from his position, standing over Magda as a human shield. Well, this kinda blows the night all to hell. Literally, for the bar.

Deadpool is dealing with that weird mix of revulsion and righteousness he tends to get after every hit like this when the bullets rip straight into his shoulder, popping a few bursts of blood, spinning the merc around with a hard jerk and dropping him to the ground. ""Ow..."" he seethes, pain now pushing him past his little moral nausea. ""Waitaminnit... since when is DEMON a racist term?"" he belatedly queries, loud enough for them to hear over the din of the flaming bar as he struggles to his feet again. ""Did I not get the latest PC Funk & Wagnalls update?"" He raises a pleading hand as he sways, looking a lot worse for wear at the moment. ""S'alright, though, kids... my damies. My work here is done, long live Jambi. Do your homework on this schlub, and you'll thank me... if you really are cops or whatever, and not psycho goo people. Watch your back, 'kay, Sancho?"" He seems dazed... and a good chunk of flesh and blood is on the street to answer why. He's lost a lot of blood already, and the bullets don't help. ""Y


""Stay down! YOU STAY DOWN! GET DOWN ON THE --"" Grey eyes widen behind the sure, steely stare of her gun. Magda barks out a disturbed sound when her suspect pretty much up and vanishes into thin air. That's not getting down. They aren't supposed to do that! She looks down at her glock, and haltingly holstering it, she sort of stands there in one of her usual dazes. The detective likes it in her own private Idaho. Shadows cast down from the roaring firelight, the growing flames finally catching the corner of her eye. She looks at the bar first, and then eyes refocusing, turns them back up on Hellboy. She just looks at him, an undone, disbelieving look that asks well: did this just happen?

Only a moment passes, and glancing back, Magda finally takes note of the fallen man. Every muscle in her clenches, and her stomach wants to do a flip. Perfect.


All is silent, for Hellboy, after the fizzle pop. Surely, there's noise in the background, but he ain't hearin' it. He just sort of stare, blankly, into the emptiness where ol' Happy-Pants just went KAPOP and vanished. It's really not that idea that makes him go all weird in the brain, it's just --- everything. And it's then that he takes a deep breath, and says to Magda, ""Normally, I don't hazard usin' language like this infront of a lady, but it must be said."" A beat.

""What the fuck was that?""

He shakes his head right after uttering it, and then looks down at -- yeah, Meaty McHamburgerface. Great. He grunts once, and then leans over to pluck the bloodied talisman up from his chest. ""Fat lot of good this dead, but -- ah well."" No crying over spilled blood, one supposes. He then sighs, and glances to Magda. ""Should I be here while you make the report, or should I vanish?"" he asks, straightforward as ever.


Stepping over haltingly, gut twisting, Magda has the blind hope to reach toward the body, her fingers feeling through all the blood and searching for a pulse. She stands back up when she finds nothing. She's in a dark place right now, feeling useless and angry for that. Shouldn't have left the guy alone. She shouldn't have gone in. Yet again, her excellent instincts chose an arrest over a life. Smooth move, you stupid whore. Lost in the land of self-deprecation, her eyes dark and her expression heavy, it's not Hellboy's voice Magda responds to. It's the sudden wail of sirens in the distance that are headed this way. ""Should get outta here,"" she answers quietly, glancing only once up at him.


""Alright,"" Hellboy says, and then sighs, jogging off. He'll lose his trail in allies and walkways -- he can't be the only meta around here with hooves. (Right?) ...And... note to self. Take shower, mend jacket, set out some anacid for MAgda for when she gets back ... maybe her scotch, too. Cursing inwardly, he heads home. Time to get out of the way so the law can take over."

Night time is an ugly thing in Beacon Harbor. Blackness everywhere, deep, far-reaching darkness, as long as the eye can see, and it extends far into the reaches of the St. Matthew household. It is a dark, foreboding building now with no light, submitting to its dark, foreboding master with no life. A breeze winds its way in from the outside, a coil of cool air marked with that scent of spring rain, hard and gray and violent, with a purifying tinge all but lost within the city. The curtains move in this breeze, lifting up to flit lazily against the figure propped against the opened kitchen window. Candles flicker from all around Magdalen, painting her in warm oranges and slinky yellows. There is not one light humming, not one machine humming. While it helps her headache, the dead silence unnerves her. It is the worst exit wound to complete the puncture hold of this night through her gut. The fine hairs stand up against her arms as she hugs a coffee mug, hands jittering as they've been for the last hour, her eyes two highways of disbelief that run out the open window. She stares up at the heavy skies, dark like everything else, and spills cold coffee on herself when she tries to drink.


It must be nervewracking, then, when the door click -- creeeeeeeeeeeak -- clicks again. The footfalls are light, purposefully so, with the slightest tick-tick, tick-tick to them. A swish, swish cuts the air, and then the patter of rain. Someone has come in from the dark and the wet, gently shakes off his coat and hangs it up, and then sighs--the hitch of a zipper, teeth unfolding little by little. But then it stops -- nothing more then gentle breathing and that tick-tick, tick-tick, till feet find the carpet and make no noise at all in it's gentle cushion.

And then tick-tick, tick-tick, as hardwood is found again, and Hellboy, big lug that he is, peeks in. He wears his body-suit today, all utilitarian muscle-hugging lines, unzipped now to the middle of his chest. Fire light, even from candles, suits him -- it lights a certain glow to his skin and his eyes! -- oh, his eyes were made to catch and hold flame, alighting and glowing from within, reflecting the firelight the way a cat on the road reflects the highbeams right before a semi makes it so much roadkill.

""Magda? The power out?""


The woman's first reaction is all reflex. Her eyes are still gazing simply, sadly out the window even as her ears have honed, the tatters of her nerves have made her hand snap down for the shoulder holster that she still wears -- she's not going to be removing it for a long time. The gun is cold and harsh against her hand, but she doesn't care, not now, not as she knows -- that sound. It takes good ears to hear Hellboy's small sigh, but an exceptional memory to register it, and Magda's always been gifted there. She hears it and knows it's him before her body's even done reacting. After a moment, she lets her gun go back into its holster, her hand instead shot out to support herself as her body decides it needs to lean on the windowsill or fall on her ass. Pick one. ""T'say the least,"" her turned body croaks back, her voice carrying flimsily through the darkness.


The tension in the air is thicker then corruption in the oval office. Hellboy frowns at it, sensing it, his fine hairs prickling up at the back of his neck, despite being wet. He shrugs slightly, and then leans against the back of a chair, his hands light on it despite his weight. ""Something the matter, Mags?"" He thought he saw power on the streets -- but this house is out. Something is amiss. He doesn't like things that are amiss. But they seem to follow this woman, and she's shown him kindness... so if they're amiss for her, he'll have to set them right.


Candlelight unveils the stress knotting up the back of her long neck. They tighten all the more with a roll of her shoulder blades, coffee mug brought up for another experimental sip. Her hand can't seem to keep it still, and with a frustrated breath, she sets it aside. Both palms rest flat on the windowsill, hands out like a criminal pleading to be cuffed. Prison would be better than this. ""You can say that,"" Magda replies, her voice like pillow talk, the only thing about her untouched by the twitches. ""I had some guy. Come in. And go. Took half my house with him. He destroyed it. It was powder. I saw it. I swear I saw it. And now I have some kid. Sleeping upstairs. He...put it back together again."" It had to happen. She's not from around here. She's no veteran. The Infinity Delirium has touched many great minds in the past. Magda's gone and lost it.


Strangely enough, Hellboy just seems to nod and roll with it. Still, for all that he accepts that the house was destroyed and now everything in it is put back together, he is more concerned about the woman about to fall apart on the windowsill. Slowly, he approaches, walking up behind her, a looming shadow caught between streetlight from outside and candleflame from within. He hesitates a moment, and then, slowly, lifts his two hands and places them on her shoulders. ""Magda,"" he says, voice soft but firm, ""sit down."" Nothing more. Just that. Straightforward. Sit down. Take a load off. Relax.


The touch burns through all her perceived madness like acid. Magda doesn't get touched that often, and how it shows. It sharpens her body, wills her eyes away from that distant point which they'd been fixated, and turns her head slightly to the side, for the first time regarding Hellboy, aware that he's really there. ""Can't sit,"" she replies, a simple fact shaded with a bit of apology. It's not that she doesn't want to, but she thinks she's forgotten how. And if she sits, she probably won't be able to get back up.

It's been a long night, full of chasing thieves to staring down guns to rescuing kids to trying to put down a man who felt like he'd been cracked out of concrete. She saw her house destroyed and rebuilt all in the same few minutes. Excuse Magda: she's gone to have tea with the Mad Hatter now. Clean up! Move down! She rubs flinchingly at her face, continuing on with her story as though never interrupted, ""Kid's upstairs. Came in through -- portal. He's got nobody.""


""I'm beginning to think that happens a lot,"" Hellboy says, as he lingers there; his hands are warm -- almost too warm, hot to the touch. The stone hand is especially that way; despite being what it is, it transmits heat well, too well. Still, even though he leaves them there for what seems interminable -- he does eventually draw back. He pads back to the hallway, to get his pack of cigarettes, get out, light one, and relax a little. Nicotine can't addict him -- but he feels good on it, just a little.

He comes back, cigarette small between his red lips, and takes is between two stone fingers gently to speak again. ""Solace House. I checked it out,"" he says. ""Just alittle nosing. Seems okay."" Still, intuition says otherwise. He trusts Magda's hunches -- she says avoiding authority is a good idea in this city. Like it or not, Solace House is an authority. They're somehow connected to something larger. He doesn't know what, but it's there, dogging the back of his mind. How could something like that, a charity, exist in this city that seems to hate it's other-worldly orphans. Still, for all his thoughts on it, he smiles. ""You gonna keep another stray, Mags?"" He asks, and there's a genuine warmth to his tone, despite his jibe. ""People are gonna talk. Like takin' on too many cats. 'steada bein' a crazy cat lady, you'll be a crazy meta lady.""


""Better than being confused with a mass-murderer,"" she murmurs back slowly, very slowly, her voice calm but a little long on the uptake. After a long pause, the look on her face a million miles away, Magda closes the window and turns to face the dark kitchen. Her eyes settle on Hellboy, finding him easily in the low light -- some part of her wondering just why. ""I don't know what to do. If he wants to go there -- if it's safe... He can't go back on the streets. I found him there. Pointing a gun at him. He's got nobody."" The bare thought of it seems to distress her, one of the first expressions that dare to touch Magda's blank face. Eyes crinkled at the corners, one hand laid on her lower belly, she wades through her kitchen to pace, body weaving in and out of the candlelight. ""What should I do, Red?""


A drag is taken, thoughtful and long, before a satisfied exhale is given. Hellboy's eyes hood, slivers of flame flickering beneath the lids. He listens to another voice, another time -- in the candle, even here, he can see faces reflected, a voice from beyond... But it's just memory. A ghost from the past. He glances away, then, and looks toward the window now, and speaks slowly. ""I can't tell you what to do, Magda. You've already opened your house to one person, and I can tell you straight out -- he's grateful. But, you're a cop; you should trust your instincts. There are two things to consider. Your job, how it will affect you both, and your home. You..."" He considers it, and then thinks better of it. ""You and I have adjusted well enough, Magda, and I'm happy for it. I don't mind a roommate down here on the floor, either. But it's really comin' down to you saying, 'What's best for me?'. I know you -- you'll think 'what's best for him'... when it may not be the bset thing for both of you. But I trust you to make the right choice, either way and you know I'll help you out.""

Which is to say: I know you're going to keep him. Just be aware of what it means. Still, he's obviously supportive. He couldn't put it any plainer. ""Also -- good news. Found ... work. Of a sort."" His tail twitches slightly. ""Grunt work, under the table. Seems to be a lot of it going on. Still, construction isn't a bad gig and I'm more durable then most, eh?""


Magda knows what's best for herself. She's known that for over a year, since Vegas, and it wouldn't be that hard to do just that. It wouldn't be hard to just load her gun the one last time. Not even a full clip. All she'd need to put in was one bullet. The familiar thought comforts and sickens her, a certain edge cutting into her movements, putting a pronounced hitch in her mindless steps. She can blame it on wrecked houses and a strange blue like that brought it together, but the real thing that's got her so upset is four feet and eleven inches and fast asleep in her bedroom. She's got a portal-orphaned kid in her house. Alone. She can't take care of a kid. She wants to. She can't. She's not good at it; she failed before, and now she's liable to -- just rip her hair out if she's not careful.

Magda grips double handfuls of her curls, gritting against the pain -- which focuses her to keep listening. And then her hands drop away, finger by finger, her pale eyes drawn back to Hellboy, the rest of her face smoothed over with distraction. ""You did?"" she asks. ""Work? You -- know. If you're still, um, adjusting. Don't need to. In case you think you do. Not gonna pay me for any of this.""


Good. Distracted. Hellboy keeps talking, voice even as ever -- he rarely seems to fluctuate beyond that easy, casual tone. Gentle, but rough, deep and basso. ""Yeah. Simple stuff; they like the idea that I'm friggin' indestructible and able to throw VW bugs like frisbees, as well as haul things no one else can around. So, they let me work."" He smirks, then, and says, ""As for what I do with my money, that's my damn business, I would think. Some of it can go into the house -- food, upkeep, the like. Or, if you want -- think of it as me paying the kid's ticket. I'm the freebie -- but I'm buying his ride. God knows he can't."" So, it's settled in Hellboy's mind. Employed, with no benefits or name or number -- just skimmed take from a foreman who has sympathies with the meta population.

He takes a drag off his cigarette, then, before taking it back from his lips. ""Does that at least help a little? I do want to help. And I want you to /let/ me help. I ain't much for free rides, myself.""


""But it doesn't have to -- I don't need money. It's not a hand-out, it's -- a sensible thing for you to take. It's traumatic. Those portals. And --"" Whatever's left of Magda's pausing, blocking voice absolutely crumbles in any attempt to rebuttal. She pales at the mention of Edward, the renewed knot tightening back in her gut. Oh God, a kid in her house, and Hellboy is proposing what? The very thought of taking some form of rent off a kid abhors Magda: this dame's more square than a girl scout. ""It's not -- a ride. Not a ticket,"" she sputters out, her voice thinning with air as the rest of her looks a little overwhelmed. Transparently, it's been a very, very long night, especially to a cop who's slept little and eaten less. ""It's help. It's my job -- it's what I'm doing. I do for a living. I help."" If only Magda looked a little less dizzy and a lot more professional.


The cigarette is crushed between hard fingers, and the cherry snuffs with a hiss. Hellboy puts it aside, on the table, mindless of the ash on his stone fingers. Instead, he approaches her quietly, and puts his hands on his hips. ""Look,"" he says simply. ""I want to help you. I know -- in my world -- what cops make. Even cops with education. You cannot support three people -- especially one who eats like /I/ do -- on your salary. There's no way. And I am not a charity case. I had enough of that when I was six, wondering if they were gonna let me be a man or an experiment. So if it's all right with you, I'd like to take what I get, give you half of it. It won't even COVER what I take up--but it will make /me/ feel better, at the very least.""

His temper is showing; the flare of his eyes, the swipe of his tail behind him, like a torked tom, ready to hiss. But he knows he's getting there, and reigns himself in, taking a five second count to calm. Then, he says. more softly, ""Let me do what I can. I've never not worked and taken care of myself. It's driving me nuts not too. All right? Please?""



The anger isn't reflected. Perhaps if Magda had a bit more spirit left in her, a bit more life, she'd choose to be annoyed at his insinuation that she can't handle this. There are obviously some things she can't handle, the reality of that crashing down on her harder each day in Beacon Harbor, but if she's anything, she's dependable. She has the capability to be very responsible. She has to be. She's the cop. It's her job. It's her nature. She couldn't live it any other way.

No anger, but Magda's sure frowning hard, her stubborn jaw thrust as she faces down a man with two feet and three hundred pounds on her. She doesn't draw back when he approaches, and though she's been startled, she's never truly been afraid of him. She faces Hellboy down with crossed arms and her head tilted to one side, watching him out the corners of her eyes, her expression wavering between resilience and resignation.

The idea hurts her heart, but she understands it. She knows that if the situation was backwards, if she was the one found wanting, she couldn't sit idly by and forget her work ethic between worlds. She'd be trying to earn her keep too. But it doesn't mean she likes this one bit. She can support them fine, goddamnit. ""OK, OK,"" Magda grumbles, her voice a begrudging huff of air as she rubs smoulderingly at the back of her neck. ""I get it. I'll take it. I'd be asking you the same thing."" Yet, she looks back up at him, pointing a finger. ""But this ain't charity. Want you to know that. Charity's being a bleeding heart because you're bored. This is my job.""


""No, your job is to protect and serve. You're protecting me plenty -- but you don't need to feed, clothe, or house me. You can argue the latter is protecting me... but..."" He shakes his head quietly, and then smirks. ""I wanna work and pay. So you'll just have to deal, alright? Like I said, consider it -- child support, if you want."" He shakes his head, then, and then eyes the fridge. ""How long has the power been out, anyway? The food gonna be okay?"" He did NOT just stock the fridge JUST to have everything spoil. No way, no how. He goes to check it, grabbing a candle off the table with a swipe of his tail as he passes, holding it to one side. Where the wax drips, the flame brushes his skin as he passes it to his hand, he does not notice, not one bit.



""They pay you to take care of strays?""

That would be the kid himself, coming in on the tail end of the conversation. Waking up needing to go to the bathroom is one thing; quietly going back to sleep is another. And when Ed hears voices downstairs, he's not about to quietly go back to sleep. So it's only natural, if typically annoying, that he wanders downstairs to poke his nose into the adults' business. Good thing they're both still clothed.

Speaking of states of dress or lack thereof, though, Ed's in casual mode himself. His hair is down around his shoulders; more pertinently, he's ditched his jacket on the bed upstairs, and he's barefoot. No, he's not thinking about the need to preserve Magda's sanity at the moment; why do you ask?

He studies the two for a moment, a bemused gaze giving particular attention to Hellboy. ""Wait, child support? How much of a kid do you think I am? I'm fifteen, and I can take care of myself!""


""It's been out for a couple hours now. And --"" Magda lets go a troubled breath, walking her tired body up to slump her hip against her kitchen counter. Her elbows thunks down upon it, and her jaw immediately takes sanctuary on the heel of her hand. She's one exhausted puppy. ""Shit, the food. It's all out. Phone lines, power lines, the whole kit 'n kaboodle. Nothing much to be done until tomorrow morning. Might just have to cook everything and then pack it in--"" Crap. Magda's eyes unhood when she hears Edward's voice from behind her. She's already replying him before she turns. ""You're not a /stray./ It's not support. But you do need help, and I still know that --"" The woman's voice blows out as if it were one of the candles. She doesn't twitch a muscle, because if she did, she'd probably be on her
ass. She stares. His arm. Foot. ""-- Much.""

It's the unevenness of the footfalls that make Hellboy look over -- not that they're there, that they sound so... /off/. It's like step-clank, step-clank. What the hell? His eyes blink in the dark, smoke-and-flame, and he says, simply, ""From what I gather, they pay people to shoot strays, not take care of 'em. But that's not what we were talking about. You must be our wonder repair man. Thanks. I don't think my new job would give Mags a house back."" Since, apparently, the house was turned to mulch and came back from said state, Hellboy has to guess the midget's him. The thanks, at least, was sincere, though. Just...said Hellboy style. He glances down at Ed for a moment, studying him by the glow of candlelight. Small kid-- especially when he says he's fifteen. Someone needs to take their vitamins!

But he looks at Magda, and then at Ed again, and sighs. ""So, shit -- fewhours and the milks probably a gonner. Uh, lets see what isn't ruined -- anybody want sandwiches?"" He pauses, and tehn says, ""Mags? There's a flare--on last one -- will burn forn an hour, pretty good light, in my coat. You wanna go get that?"" Yeah, he carries flares for kicks. Or did. In his line of work. Maybe.


Edward's expression ventures out of its approximation of neutrality into a scowl. ""I can help *myself*. I--"" He stops, giving Magda a puzzled look. What's she so worked up about? ""What are you *staring* at?"" A beat, as he jumps to entirely the wrong conclusion: ""I'm not lying! I'm fifteen, and I'm still growing, and someday I'll be taller than *you* at least--""

Oh yeah. He cuts off abruptly, casting an embarassed look down at his right hand, his left foot. ""...oh. That. It's, uh. You don't have automail here?"" Apparently not. He's still getting used to this world, all right. Speaking of which, he wanders up to Hellboy to peer up (waaaay up) at him, frowning. ""Are you a chimera? A homonculus?"" He reaches up to poke gingerly at Hellboy's chest with his left hand, but mercifully any further inquiry on his part is deterred by the next line of conversation. 

""Who cares about the milk anyway? Let it spoil. I can have some sandwiches, though! I am kind of hungry.""


Magda can't help it. She just has to stare at Edward for a heartbeat or five, confusion and dismay colouring her face as she studies the spots where wicked metal meets flesh. Her first thought is not wondering how it's possible, but why the hell someone thought about attaching that stuff to a kid. He's so little! Where the hell did he come from? ""Automail?"" she echoes strangly, one hand clapping up to give her face a harsh rub, smearing away anything that takes her from her dour, blank default. Something Hellboy says thankfully steals her mind back. ""Euh?"" she asks, her head turned. ""Flare? Sure."" The cop's all too thankful to do something right this minute.

She forces herself to stand straight up, but pauses in the midst of her steps out of the kitchen, her eyes hooked after Ed and watching his journey towards Hellboy. Introductions are probably in order. At least, they beat chest-pokes. ""That's HB,"" she tells the kid first, then to Hellboy, ""And Red, that's --"" Magda stops. She rolls her eyes in self-deprecating, grunting something at herself as she palms her brow. Back to Edward, she adds, ""Y'know, with all the insanity, don't think I got your name.""


Hellboy laughs as Magda admits to not getting the boys name -- he didn't get hers until after vampire slayage. But despite the questions and the poking of his chest, he doesn't really seem to mind the prodding. ""I am not a chimera, or a ...homonculus. Though, I do have a homonculus friend of mine. His name is Roger."" He grins. ""He's a really great guy. But he's not here, it seems. Still-- I'm neither of those things."" He doesn't have a great big knocker ovre his crotch. C'mon. Homoculus? ...Sheesh. ""And a chimera --  where I'm from -- is a three-headed legendary beast that died after someone shoved a big chunk of lead down it's throat... followed a few hundreds years later by feeding it concussion grendades that turned it into a three headed trophy on my mantle. But..."" He shrugs. ""I'm Hellboy. HB. Whichever.""

Fixings for food is laid on the table, and he asks, helpfully, ""What do you like on your sandwiches, Ed? Mayo, mustard, ham, beef, what?"" Just want to know, if he's gonna be doing his thing here. Domestic Demon. Who knew?


Now it's Ed's turn to stare. Hellboy gets a thoroughly boggled look. ""Uh. Never mind,"" he says weakly. Magda provides him with a safer topic. He can't go wrong with his name! (He does not know about this city's history with Elrics just yet.) ""Edward Elric."" He eyes her skeptically, adding, ""I didn't get your name, either."" Or if he did, he doesn't remember it; it was kind of a confusing day.

With considerably more enthusiasm, he bounds into the kitchen. Food! ""I don't care. Just as much as possible. Better keep it from spoiling,"" he adds, innocently. See, he's only trying to help!


""Edward,"" she echoes, her voice seeming to lack its grating, ragged razorblade edge when it's directed down at the kid. Thankfully, it's the only thing on her that's close to mollifying. Back to her senses, and not a bleeding heart, damnit. She exhales out into her addition of, ""Call me Magda.""

A curious look begins to cross through the severe amount of confusion and fatigue she's still wearing like two heavy masks, and the woman welcomes that. But, with one last glance arched back as her two stays talk food, Magda escapes the first instant she can. She slips out of the kitchen, treading carefully through the pitch blade house for the foyer. She'll take her time to go hunting for the flare.


Hellboy makes sandwichs like the pro, nearly-sixty bachelor that he is. The then puts one on a plate -- not that plate is good at supporting the massive thing he was requested to make -- and asks, in a mild (and oh so slightly amused) tone, ""That gonna be enough for you, squirt? Kid yer age, ready for a growth spurt... gotta be well fed."" Gotta know he went through his at twelve -- and went up to seven feet tall. But then, he's special. And not the 'I ride the moral shortbus' sort of special that Ed is.

""Magda,"" Ed echoes thoughtfully, absently swiping hair back out of his face. ""Okay."" And then he's concentrating on far more important matters: namely, the sandwiches. He gleefully reaches out to grab the sandwich--

And then Hellboy speaks. Ed's expression? Slide whistle down. ""*Squirt*?"" He is so not impressed.

""Who's so small he could get lost between the slices of bread in this one sandwich? Huh? Who are you calling short?""


Scraping around in the darkness, probably aware she should have taken a candle alongside, Magda navigates through touch alone. Thankfully, her house is anything but painfully large, and within a handful of steps, she's scouting her long fingers in and out of Hellboy's gigantic coat, the huge sheet of leather that could easily swallow her up five times over. She glances back towards the kitchen in the midst of hunting for the flare, her eyes narrowing at the distant voices. Blowing out an amused breath, chin tucked, the woman shakes her head. Even if she does find it, she's not walking back into that.


""You, if you don't eat your sandwich,"" Hellboy says with absolute lack of concern for Ed's irritation. So, that's that. He goes to make his own sandwich, then, his hands busy, the stone one weilding the tiny knife like a giant would weild a broadword, swiping mustard like a pro before he takes up his own meal. ""Don't get your panties in a twist, eh? Just a figure of speech.""

The flare -- along with bullets, a wallet, you know, other things commonly in pockets -- are there.. course, Magda has to feel every bizarre item, from coins to crosses, sewn into the coat itself... That's gotta feel weird. Probably not very comfy, either. 


Eventually, Ed's rage dies down. He still glowers sullenly up at Hellboy, but he snatches the sandwich and stalks back to the table. ""I'm *still growing*,"" he snarls under his breath, and he then proceeds to more or less inhale the sandwich. Kid's got a black hole in his stomach."

The true secret, the one that will die with her, is that she sort of got to like eating dog food. To the extent that she was beginning to question her genes, and wonder just what percent of them were canine in origin. To the extext that, to the back that likes to hunch and the eye that likes to spy, would find a couple wayward cans hidden in one of her bottom kitchen cupboards. But -- at least her odd tastes are voluntary. ""--They tested to see what you could ingest?"" Magda echoes, her heart sickened at the thought. She smears her hair back from her face, letting through the crease knotted between her eyebrows. It only compels her more to do something nice. She'll buy two boxes. ""Not too much. Just tell me the brand you like and hope to God it exists between worlds. And I'll take your mortal weaknesses to the grave. Scout's honor with righteous hairnets on top.""


""What I like is illegal in the states now; used to get 'em in Cuba when I went through the place. That's a major hot spot -- if it's not Voudoun, it's slave-ghosts. If it's not slave ghosts, it's fish monsters... Though Caribbean islands, they're a bad, bad place to be."" And not just because of stogie smokin' dictators, either. Fidel is nothing compared to, oh, that thing with the thousand pointy teeth. ""Still, I'll work up somethin'."" Something low priced and nice. Yes. Decent, but not about to break her bank. It'd not be right. She's his hostess. Here's hoping his brands do cross over. At least some of 'em, at least... we hope.

But he blinks. ""Hairnets on top? What are you, the dishwasher angel? You gonna get an apron and a pair of gloves, too?"" Hairnets, indeed. People only wear hairnets in the back of restaurants and food processing plants.


""Illegal, eh,"" she mutters around a drink of her lager, feigning a look of a deep cop disapproval. ""Doncha worry, I'll find you something nice."" Finally feeling something close to an appetite, Magda rises from her chair -- but not without one incredulous look to Hellboy. She's amused even if she'll never show it. ""Hairnets! You don't get it?"" she asks expectantly. She dismissives him with a flung hand, stepping to her stove, mumbling to herself as she dishes up. ""Nobody ever gets it. C'mon. Habits. Veils. Righteous put 'em on to make themselves look less--"" she pauses. Apparently she has the trouble saying the word 'sexy,' among many others. ""Good-lookin'. Hairnets? Doing the same? And -- OK. So I tell bad jokes.""


Hellboy blinks again -- he doesn't know if he's more bewildered by the slightly blasphemous reference to the habit as a hairnet, or that Magda's apparently insinuating she does the same. Damn. Well. huh. He blinks, and then shakes his head. ""Sorry, darlin'. Were it not for the 'hell' in my name, I probably woulda been an alterboy. And my love of violence sort of staved off my career in the priesthood. Sides, baptism with this hand? Gets kinda clunky..."" He wiggles his thick, stone fingers -- remarkably mobile for rock -- and then settles back. Well, /that/ was a segue for the weird.


That stops her. It also wins him a good, hard look. Staring up from her bowl of greasy, helped lasagna, paused in mid-bite, Magda curiously looks Hellboy over. ""You're religious?"" she asks, more curious and less shocked. And maybe a little surprised. She only remembers then, the fact hitting her like a hammer, seeing a rosary on him from that initial night. She add sheepishly, ""I'll apologize now then -- f'all the swearing."" She's in her own league: hardly spiritual, doubtful of a God, believer in a good heart. Her bible's the law, in there the reality of moral absolutes as good as they get.


Hellboy laughs abruptly, for all of that she just went through -- the look, the apology, the fumbles. ""Yes, Magda, I'm religious -- I'm a theologian of sorts, actually. But I was raised Catholic. Still, I've shook hands with Baba Yaga and I've been possessed by Thor. I do recognize there's... more then just, y' know, the Big Guy. Still, he's the one I prefer to answer too, given my choices of deity."" The rosary is always with him; either at his wrist or his belt. It never leaves, that swaying, clicking reminder of the prayers he must speak. ""And I can't say I've been very active or devout. And I swear, too, so no worries, Magda. No worries. Swear I won't go chasin' you with a bible, either.""

His amusement is plain, in the low tenor of his voice to the the tail-twitch at the tip of his tail. Oh, the poor woman. ""And you'll notice, I bought the beer and I love the stogies. I'm hardly a saint."" See? Now calm down, and go back to normal. Please beam Super Polite Alien Magda back to the mothership, and Hellboy and normal Magda will get along just fine.



Thus abducted promptly, he'll just have to realize he's stuck forever with the old one, stormclouds, sour looks, and swear words included. The uncertainty lingers within her a moment as her grey eyes scrape over him -- Normal Magda just doesn't work well where etiquette's involved. She's never been a civil, social creature, especially now because most of her could really care less. She'd rather just scoot off and avoid people altogether, rather than feel passably guilty for offending whomever's in earshot. She doesn't know why she still bothers talking at all these days. People elude her. Give her more headaches than her humming appliances do.


In any case, watching him, the only thing she can manage to get out of her mouth is a quiet, crumbly, ""You were...possessed. By Thor."" Light-hearted all over again, and very grateful for that, Magda huffs her amusement on her journey to dismiss her half-eaten bowl to the sink. ""You're somethin' else, Red. Y'know that?""


""Damn right I am,"" Hellboy says, with relish. But he puts his food aside and then says, ""Thor was no picnic. He was an angry, angry God. He did some bad things, but..."" He shrugs. ""He played his role. He was a war god -- and while I love a good rough and tumble, the whole violence for violence's sake just sort of loses me."" He shrugs then, and reclines in his chair.

""You got sweet Mary Magdalen's name -- but I take it you and faith never exactly shook hands and made friends, then?""


""I can't believe it. Your life makes mine read like stereo instructions. Goddamn soup can,"" she mumbles, though amiably. She'll pass on the Norse god possessions, thank you ever so much. All she can do is chuff. Apparently Thor exists. Not here -- but somewhere, in the infinite permutations of reality, he's out there. Among with, technically, anything else that a very, very idle mind could possibly think up. It blows Magda's mind and makes her sick in the gut, all at the same time. Ever so restless, she puts her hands on the kitchen counter and pushes herself effortlessly up, letting her slender feet dangle. She pulls her hair bemusedly out of its ponytail. ""Euh,"" she says escapily, not quite sure if she wants to get into a conversation about religion. She bites her lip, head tilting as she scratches one shoulder. ""Yeah. I was orphaned as a baby. The place that brought me up was religious, old school. They named me, crammed all the lessons into me, blah blah blah, mea culpa. I don't know. Never took with me. Nothing against it. Never was my bag.""


Hellboy shrugs his shoulders. ""Not any weirder then some guy with stubs on his head and red skin going by Hellboy having chats with the Pope,"" he offers genially, not at all weirded out. ""Actually, I'm really pleased you're taking this -- me -- this well. I mean, normally, I get a lot of freaky things with those who've spent most of their lives doing normal things..."" He grins, though, obviously pleased, his white teeth stark between his dark, red lips. ""You seem to adjust pretty quick, though. And have only smacked into my tail a couple of times."" See? Happy Hellboy.


""Yeah yeah,"" she deadpans, feigning irritation that quickly melts from her easy-going expression. Her storm clouds are passing. ""About as many times as you've smacked your head into the doorframe, smartass. --But hey. If my life's soup, then it's the chunky shit. Not watered down, condensed crap. Beacon's starting to make Vegas look like the promised land, but've seen my fair amount of stuff to make my future shrink cross his knees."" Magda lets her hair down with a shake of her head, rolling her neck and tossing her shoulders. Her body's slowly easing out of work mode, winding away the tension -- the rest should be alleviated with alcohol.

""Only thing I'm adjusting to is having someone who finally doesn't get on my nerves,"" she admits when she slumps back on the spot. ""And having food that's not out of a box."" Magda shrugs, her feelings on the issue as simple as that. She did startle when she met him, but it was sheer reflex. She's a type that adjusts superbly to change -- even if she doesn't like a lot of it -- bred since a baby to be forced to adapt. While she may bend easily, it will take much to have her break. She's already adapted to Hellboy, not that she had to force herself to, and while he's not just another person to her, he's neither the picture of a lurking monstrousity. He's unusual. He's interesting as hell. Different. He's -- well, him. A person with real personality. And she likes that.


""I like chunky soup,"" Hellboy says without surl at all, simply putting in his two cents. His bowl is now empty, and so is his beer. But he does not go for another. It's tapped out, and he's simply reclining now. Quiet, hamburger helped, and ready to consider his next move. It's hard to consider next moves right now, but still, he needs too.

So what does he do? He lays the bottle on the table and spins it idly with a finger, quietly. IT's like slow-mo spin the bottle only... not. ""Besides. You could have my life. My life is five alarm chilli with a side of pure, fresh wasabi and a little nuclear power tossed in for flavor. You wouldn't want nuclear wasabi chilli, would you?""


""That decision rides up on one important question: 'm I given a fork or a spoon?"" Magda looks at Hellboy out the corners of her eyes, somewhat wry. Though she doesn't smile, she bites loosely on her bottom lip, traces of amusement there in her face. Her eyes soon switch to his beer bottle, lolling on its side and beach whaled on the kitchen table. Watching it spin just makes her crave more alcohol. She braces herself and hops off the counter, her back curling with the agility of someone who does a few hundred sit ups every morning. Magda crosses to her fridge, eyeing its fullness suspiciously, having to push aside about twenty different foodstuffs to get to her scotch. She's a weird woman who prefers her liquors as cold as she can get them. ""Wanna hit?"" she asks of Hellboy, giving the frosty bottle an inviting wiggle.


Oooh. Real liquor. Not that it does much to him unless he cleans out the entire bottle -- or two or three. He just grins a little, his tail quirking up, and his brow matching it. ""Yeah, sure, what the hell. Hit me, bartender."" He pauses, and then says, oddly, ""You'd make a good bartender, I bet. Just enough friendliness to be alright with customers, just enough snark to make sure no body fucks with you, and make sure the drunks get thrown into a cab even if they bitch.""


Grabbing two glasses in one hand, Magda fills them a good amount, each with a few shots' worth. She doesn't dare mix a thing into them -- doing such would be heresy. His voice in the background is oddly comforting. By all means, the woman should have a jittery hand and be pouring spills all over the place, some part of her still uptight about werewolves and all that worry, but Hellboy puts her at ease. ""So, you think you know me?"" she asks playfully as she crosses towards the table, handing him his glass.


Hellboy laughs, and then shakes his head. ""Hell, I don't think I know me some days. I can't really speak for others,"" he says. ""But I can cast my lot with guessing, can't I, with all other foolish men, huh?"" He reaches back to take his glass, twirling the liquid just a little, before he takes a sip, enjoying the mild (to him) burn as it coats his throat. A rumble is given, a contented noise some somewhere in that deep, broad chest. But then he says, as he puts the glass down. ""So how do I remedy that, anyway? Shall we play truth or dare and don stupid things like we're fifteen again?"" he asks, leaving out that he was killing demons for a living at that age and not playing truth or dare with anybody.


Magda, on the other hand, is not about sipping. Alcohol, like life, is not meant to be sipped. It's downed, hard and fast like a whiplash, intense and scalding. There's a lot to tell about a person the way they drink, and her fierce taming of her scotch in two gulps paints her a frightening picture. It burns her something fierce, but she's a woman who appreciates the crash 'n' burn lifestyle, retriving the bottle before contentedly finding a chair. She pours herself a second, a bit too much when her eyes mistakingly turn from her glass and up on Hellboy. ""Truth or dare?"" she echoes, incredulous and entertained. ""I was the squarest fifteen-year-old, have you know. Didn't even kiss a boy 'til my twenties,"" she adds dubiously, her previous two beers talking there.


Hellboy watches it -- he doesn't say anything, and his craggy face is always hard to read. But all the same, he doesn't smile. He just says, ""I was employed by the government by the age of twelve,"" he says, ""and my first kiss came in... '79. I was thirty-five."" So again he tops her. ""Anastasia Branfield, an English archaeologist. Lovely girl, going to be a sacrifice for the Obsidian Danse. Interesting little cult. Squashed 'em good."" He takes another sip of his scotch, a deeper draught this time, and savors it.

He considers. ""First and last love. But, eh. Shit happens."" He shrugs slightly. ""So where did you go to school, anyway? You said you were on scholarship.""


Tops her like the Marquis de Sade tops Roses Are Red. Magda stares at Hellboy, that same, disarmed look as usual. Just when she's sure she can handle another one of his stories, he trumps her with a royal flush of sheer insanity. What appears to be his love story visibly gets her curious, but she doesn't dare question. There's tact, and there's just the angels and the fearing to tread. And shit happens? She concludes that with a fierce emptying of her second glass. It sure does. Back with the pouring, something that Magda's going to be doing a lot of in the next hour, she hoods her eyes and exhales deeply, breathing through the sting of the liquor. ""Yep. Duke. Nice place. Got my degree in Honours Crim. Broke my ass for that one.""


With the mention of Stacie, Hellboy finds that finishing off the drink in short, curt gulps is good. Yes. A burn -- just like the burn he got from that affair. He swallows it down, and then sets the glass own, to be refilled at Magda's leisure. But he nods quietly, listening. ""Good place, though apparently you lived on dogfood,"" he says with amusement. ""Not that I haven't eaten worse. MY best friend? Fondness for rotten hard-boiled eggs. But he's also a fishman, so..."" He shrugs slightly. Yeah, there's that trump again. He doesn't MEAN to make it one-up, but still... It just sort of ends up that way."

<lj-cut text=""Hellboy decides that his money is as good as anyone elses."">


He couldn't be expected to stay in the house all day. Not his style. He's never been a homebody, Hellboy. He likes to travel -- to feel foreign earth under his hooves, alien wind against his back. A Child of the World, this one. But this is a whole new dimension, so everything here is new and foreign! He knows very well that his credit cards are shot -- but at least he's got some cash. $150 dollars is the sum of his wealth now.

And he went out and he spent it on two things. Groceries and books. 

He came home with the books first -- just a couple. Some American history, meta-history, and a few magazines to get a feel for the culture. Then, he left again and came back with a cart he'd procured from the shopping venue and a good $100 in groceries. Veggies, meat, noodles, some toiletries for himself, and a few other things. Sure, it's presumptuous -- but he'd leave it all here in a heart beat if Magda threw him out and simply forget it's loss. It's just his way. But right now, he's carefully loading the fridge, a small, five-buck radio tinnily reporting news from an AM station.


It statics the moment the front door is wrenched open. Magda has arrived, and she doesn't look impressed. Smoke streams from her lips in satiny veils that light the glint of grey eyes behind it. Tendrils of wind from the outside blow her hair as if by the amused fingers of breeze children. She for one is not as amused as they, tense fingers forking the Marlboro whose tip gleams in the half-darkness. She stands at the entrance to the foyer, her body a tiny, angular wall of fierce silence, finally broken by the harsh way she skins herself of her leather jacket. She makes no move to hang it up, tossing it irritably aside, her right foot kicked back to slam the door into place. It shakes the whole condo.

Her entire appearance is rushed. Like she rolled into her clothes like they were paint and rushed out the first moment possible. Her body is haphazard, face without make up -- as if it ever is -- and hair hastily knotted back, jeans wrinkled and shoes untied. She doesn't seem to care, though it does not need to be insinuated that the commenting on her appearance would be a mistake. Magda seethes.

A smoke between his lips -- after all, lady of the house does it, so he presumes to use an ashtray and be clean about it -- Hellboy looks up from his work, and then leans back into the fridge, picking out a lager. ""Here,"" he says, putting it on the table once she makes her way into the small dining room, his muscles working like ragged poetry beneath the black stretchtop. ""You have a day, Mags?"" Already casual. That easy. He's never been one to sit on formality, even with someone who's hosting his sorry ass rejected self after he fell outta the sky and into her car chase.


Upon reaching the kitchen, two things stop Magda in her tracks. The first being that, in all her frustration, all her anger, she nearly forget she'd acquired herself a haphazard roommate, albeit seven feet and completely red. The second being that, ""...You got food."" The look on her face is a residue of anger, the scowl she wore all the way back from work, but her voice is a cough of confusion and -- most of all -- surprise. Food doesn't get bought for her that often. If at all. Staring quietly, mood derailed, almost crashed like the AmEx, she haltingly plods forward for the proffered lager. ""Yeah,"" she finally answers his question.

""You don't shop for food, I've noticed,"" Hellboy says as he goes back to putting away groceries. ""I, being unnaturally large, strong, and having an enhanced healing factor, require lots of food. If I allowed you to shop, I would be eating your trash or furniture -- and not having much trouble with that, mind you -- within days."" He doesn't really WANT to dig in trash, see, but he could. It would be easy. Just .. you know, disgusting. He puts a few more things away, trailing smoke with the motion of his head as his cigarette smolders between his lips, before he takes it from them with his large, right hand. He carefully pinches it between two of his enormous fingers, and then leans against the counters. ""Hope you don't got any allergies.""


Visibly, she trikes to shake the surprise away, the fact that an immigrant fresh out of a portal just braved the city in order to stock up his hostess's very house. Magda feels guilty, feels irritated because she feels guilty, and then lets that irritation remind her that she's seriously pissed off out of her mind. Kicking out of her shoes on the spot, body twisting to snap up the lager like an insect buzzing on a fly trap, she grumbles out a grouchy but earnest, ""Yeah, sorry 'bout that. I'll reimburse you,"" before she disappears to the living room, preferring to pace circles than sit down.


Hellboy snorts. ""You don't need to. I'm only out a hundred,"" he says simply, as if this were chump change. And maybe, where he's from, it was nothing -- and he probably isn't thinking, 'Aw, shoot, I don't have that sweet fat nest-egg to fall back on!' ... Maybe. Or maybe he just doesn't care about the material things. He may be one of those free-loving anti-capitalism types. But they usually don't carry elephant guns, now do they? Tail cutting the air behind him, he puts things up and finally closes the last of the cupboards and sits down -- a bag of chips in hand, which he opens, and begins to munch on. ""So, should I not say, 'How was work, honey?' and make with the cozy conversation, or should I just sit and watch you drink?""


Stopping, Magda turns a sharp stare on Hellboy. Getting a look from her is a lot like a swipe from a razorblade. It's not much at the time, but later, it can surely sting. Her nose wrinkles, sneering gruesomely, and it's really a good thing that her irrational anger never lasts long. It slips into resignation as she slips back into the kitchen, no doubt after a few attempts that she can't tear the cap off her lager no matter how many fingers she lacerates. Placing it down -- thankfully finished with slamming things -- Magda unamusedly goes for her silverware drawer, metal jangling around as she hunts for her bottle opener. Loose tresses of her hair fall into her face and do not help her mood. Muscles stand in knots against her neck, and her temples indent, flickering, when her jaw grits. ""Free country,"" she gravels back, voice low and jagged, but at the same time, distracted. Not directed at him. ""You pick.""


It's a good thing that Hellboy's a walking callus, all rough whorls and patterns that tend to hurt the mind if one tries to examine them too closely in his skin. But he reaches over the table once she's gotten up, he pauses quietly, and then sets his cigarette down in the ashtray, reaches over -- and then pops the cap off the lager with a TINK! and a PING! Then he flips it up with his right hand, and catches it in his left. ""You ever need a hard lid popped off, just ask,"" he says simply, admiring the nearly-bent-in-twain cap, before he drops it to the table and retakes his cigarette, his human hand -- even muscular as it is -- an exercise in delicacy compared to the monster fingers that just uncapped Magda's booze.


If there's anything in the world that can pause the impotent, slow-burn temper of Magdalen St. Matthew, it's seven feet tall, four hundred pounds, horned, tailed, and really good at helping her access alcohol. Her hands settle on the edge of her drawer, and she exhales as she slowly pushes it shut. When she steps back towards the table where both he and her lager await, much of the tension's left her body. She just looks tired. And apologetic. ""I'll remember,"" she replies sullenly, appending that with, ""Thanks."" Brushing back her hair, she doesn't sit, rather stands there with her hip bone leaning against the table, shoulders slumped forward, chin tucked. She takes a deep, grateful swig of her beer, letting the alcohol roast her voice into a deep, rumble of ""'n sorry.""


""S'okay. I have days, myself. Just not often."" He says, before he takes the last satisfying drag off his cigarette, and then stubs it out, issuing smoke from his mouth with a heavy sigh, a sheet of grey fluttering before his eyes, a hint of the Anung Un Rama within the Hellboy. But just like that, it's gone, and he's himself, as he has always been -- or rather, as she's always known him; stubbed-horned, block-jawed, cliff-browed. ""So what is it that has you wound so tight? Work issues? Higher ups getting' you down?""


She stands there, simply existing between alternating indulges of cigarette and alcohol. Finally, with her Marlboro hanging from her lips, her fingernails dinging absent chords against the glass of her lager, Magda looks at Hellboy when he speaks, and then sits down. She hooks a chair with her ankle and pulls it out, flopping instantly on the spot. Barely she knows him, and strangely she's already casual with their situation, choosing to watch her beer dangle as she holds it by the neck between two fingers. ""Work's work,"" she replies at first. It'll never be pleasant. She's never expected it to be. ""It's -- you remember me telling you about the, um,"" she's still not used to saying this word, ""wolf. Werewolf. Him -- the guy -- he was here. Earlier. Guess you're out there.""


Orange eyes widen -- it's like she's just said, 'Hellboy, I've not even slept on the same floor as you, but I'm having your baby'. It could not have been a worse kind of shock and horror. Werewolf. Here. And he said he'd help her. Well, fine lot of help he is. ""Tonight, we're gonna do a funky little thing, called 'casting out demons with beans',"" he says evenly. ""Just so you know. It's an old Japanese ritual, they do it every year. It prevents creatures -- like that -- from coming into your house without being invited in."" ... He's so angry now; it's a quiet, horrible anger. He was out, and she had that damn werewolf here again. ""OBviously, you're not human confetti, so I have to guess the meeting was... amicable. Or at least, nonviolent.""


""Beans?"" she replies, the disbelief naturally imbuing her voice. It's as though he suggested doing the hokey pokey to cast summoned demons back to the womb of Hell. Which is probably a likely thing to do in this god damned world. Confused, and hating when she's confused, Magda leans her elbow up on the table and uselessly tries to banish her headache with her fingers stabbing her forehead. ""It's -- OK. It's not me. I asked him in. He came here to apologize, but a lotta fuckin' good words are. I told him,"" she says emphatically, pointing at thin air with her hand around her lager, ""I'd do something. This asshole thinks he's got it under control. He's out there, and there's people he can hurt, even himself, and he thinks he's got it good. And it --"" Magda can't sit for very longer. Her natural instinct is to fidget, to pace, to keep moving no matter what. She'll move until she's got a hole put through her kitchen floor. ""It makes me so mad. I chased the shit down, had him right under me, and I saw the thing right under his face. Moving. It -- he was ready to turn into it. That's all it took. Fuckin' control, my fuckin' ass.""


Hellboy thinks quietly, leaning back. He knows -- he /knows/ -- better then anyone what it is to be out of control, to have something sleeping inside you that you don't want to wake. For him, the inner demon is not figurative, it's literal. And what about Liz? What about Liz who cried to him, when he first walked in her fire-proofed room, her dinner all over the floor because an agent -- a grown man! -- was scared of an eleven year old girl in pigtails. She said terrible things. Horrible things that made his heart break. ""I will say this -- and only because I've been there. Sometimes it's a battle. Every day. I've watched it. Watched people struggle. And eventually, it came to the point where I said, 'Every day, I could kill someone driving because of a judgment error, or simply for looking at someone with a weak heart wrong. We all have the power to kill, just by losing our tempers or having a moment of weak judgment, Mags -- so I can't judge that.""

But he leans back, thoughtful, his peace said. ""He said he has help? He's got support? What is he doing? What sort of measures is he taking? Do you know where he is, what he's doing?"" He's gone investigator again -- wanting to help, aid, of if he must, terminate. It's simply ingrained.


""Of course we got the power,"" she replies, tense but not condescending. Magda rubs frustratedly at her face as she walks back and forth, beer sloshing out of her forgotten lager. ""We can be smart or be stupid at any point of our lives. But this guy? Different. He stubs a toe and turns into monster wolf. And he told me so -- ain't him at the wheel. It's a fuckin' animal. And I've been there, I've had that thing right on toppa me, one foot holdin' me down, breathin' this close,"" she snarls to herself, her speech sliding down with anger, slurring into something a little more Southern. She doesn't talk much, but when she does like this, she spits out words faster than a jackhammer. ""He said he got -- wha'd he fuckin' call it.""

She swigs her beer, swallowing it distastefully as she grunts out, ""Procedures. Yeah. Someone locks him in a silver cage when it gets moony. Funny, didn't stop him from wanting to tear my throat out. I escaped lucky. Wha'd if it been some kid? Anyone who pissed him off? People piss off people ever damn day."" Just look at her. ""And what'd I do if I catch him? Can't lock him up. Not at work. Fuckin' fry him there. PETA'd be down their fuckin' throats, it'd be so nasty what'd they do. I let him go, let him off go hurt more people, it'll be my fault 'cause I knew they'd hurt him there. I do that for him, he doesn't want my help. Pisses me off, Red. S'why I'm pissed right off.""


""You know, Magda,"" Hellboy says slowly, after a long, thoughtful pause. ""The more you talk about this place, the more I hate it here. And I've only gone to your supermarket and your liquor store."" He gets up then, walking over to get a pack of cigarettes out of his coat pocket, his small hand dipping inside with practiced, smoking-for-years ease, and pulls the pack free, slides it out, tapes one free -- Camels are his flavor of choice. He puts it to his mouth, pulls out a small box of matches, and strikes it against his hard, thick, wrist, bringing it up to flare the tip; soon the cherry glows hot hot red, and Hellboy smokes and thinks, thinks /hard/.

""I don't know what to tell you, Magda. I really don't. We had that problem with Liz, too. Anyone pissed her off, and ... yeah. People got hurt. Not her fault. She was simply born with a ...gift no body else was. Made her a target and a freak. But I also know she struggled for over twenty years, packing her bags and leaving fourteen times before she finally went back to the agency with control, iron and impregnable. Your doggyboy? No idea. Couldn't tell you what you can think or do or who you can save or damn. But he's gotta live with it as much as you do."" He takes a long drag, and exhales. ""At least in my world, we've got the bureau. It's not the best thing by any shakes,""


""You know, Magda,"" Hellboy says slowly, after a long, thoughtful pause. ""The more you talk about this place, the more I hate it here. And I've only gone to your supermarket and your liquor store."" He gets up then, walking over to get a pack of cigarettes out of his coat pocket, his small hand dipping inside with practiced, smoking-for-years ease, and pulls the pack free, slides it out, tapes one free -- Camels are his flavor of choice. He puts it to his mouth, pulls out a small box of matches, and strikes it against his hard, thick, wrist, bringing it up to flare the tip; soon the cherry glows hot hot red, and Hellboy smokes and thinks, thinks /hard/.

""I don't know what to tell you, Magda. I really don't. We had that problem with Liz, too. Anyone pissed her off, and ... yeah. People got hurt. Not her fault.

""At least in my world, we've got the bureau. It's not the best thing by any shakes,"" and here his lip curls, a feral commentary despite his calm, plodding speech, ""But at least it was something. This? Goddamn. It's... not human, Magda. And I don't care what I look like -- I know it took a panel of judges to grant me human rights. But they're /still my rights/."" He shakes his head then, somber, sober with the thought of it. ""I don't know what to do here -- if he can be helped, taught, controlled, medicated, anything. I don't even like the idea of the tests I'd have to run to find out -- they're inhumane. But..."" He shrugs slightly. ""I can't do anything here anyway. I'm a ghost. A big, red, grocery-shoppin' ghost."" He smirks around the cigarette then, and adds, ""Boo.""


""I just... I want to have the answer. I've always had the answer. I had it in Vegas, but not here. I don't know why I even came here. This city's gonna drive me outta my goddamned mind. You realize you just fell into the city with the biggest death toll in the States? And me? I hate death. You wanna learn something about me, there it is. Death and me hate each other. I've been a cop for years, and I've never killed anyone. I've never put anyone into ICU. And I'm not about to change that here."" Magda puffs one last breath out of her cigarette then tosses it into the sink, billowing out smoke through a gulp of lager. She lets the bottle refuge to the counter before letting her lanky self fall slack, one elbow and forearm planted down as her socked feet hug the hardwood.

Magda all but sprawls while still standing, hair pushed back, shirt rolled up to peek the small of her back. She doesn't move from that position for a long time, it becoming apparent that she's listening, controlling her anger enough to hear out Hellboy's words. She already respects him enough to do so. ""You'n me both,"" she grunts back finally, her voice rough but at least softened from what it was before. ""The reason I was attacked in the first place? I look like this girl. She murdered here in town. A lot. I checked it out, and... Red, it's spookier than shit, you couldn't tell her and me apart. You, or the rest of the place. Some people have--"" She loses that sentence, letting it go out in a breath. ""It's why he won't let me help. He doesn't trust the way I look. Lots don't and lots won't. Something to suck up and bear."" And then she turns, just slightly, looking over the rise of her shoulder. ""But you're no ghost. I think you could do something. I mean -- you've been here a day, and you know this stuff tenfold than me. I don't know you much, but what I do? If anyone'd have that answer I'm looking for, my bet's on you.""



Hellboy blinks mildly, once, twice, his orange eyes peering through the curtain of smoke he's just exhaled, as he listens to her just... let go. She needed that. He was fine with being the one she said it to. All of it. ""I've never killed an honest to God human being. I've kill some things that were once human, and I've killed things that were made from parts of humans, and I've killed things that looked like humans. But never a real human being. But that's my deal. It's one of those things I just don't do. I am not an executioner. I'm an exterminator, an investigator, but I am not an executioner."" 

His tail belies his calm, it cuts back and forth behind his chair, before it curls around a leg tightly, as if he wills it to be still. But only for a moment, because then he's getting up, and rolling his neck and shoulders with an audible pop. ""I'll take that,"" he says, ""As a high compliment, by the way. Because -- shit, man. I don't know anything here. I don't even know if my rules apply anymore."" He pauses. ""As for the other... you? Your face? Never seen it before in my life. So, there. You have someone who doesn't want to shoot, hurt, bite, claw, maim, or spit on you because of a circumstantial thing. Hell, I busted up your car. I wouldn't be surprised if you made a nice red leather coat outta my ass for that.""

He grins, then; a touch of levity always helps /him/. Hopefully help her. He gestures, taking the cigarette from his lip and then says, ""C'mon. Pick what you want for dinner. I'll see what I can whip up outta what you think looks good, huh? And I swear to God, the hamburger helper boxes are there for the nights we feel /lazy/.""

Part of him twitches slightly. We. ""At least, till I can get the hell out of your living room. Then it'll be for when you're lazy."" Never wanting to overstep or overstay, that's Hellboy.


Magda doesn't smile back. She's not a smiler, and may never be. But the appreciation is there in her face, the light-heartedness surely hitting her and making her least likely to combust on the spot. She blows out a thick breath, her way of laughter, her shoulders felling as her body deflates from expelled tension. She lowers her head heavily into her palm, watching Hellboy on an angle as her eyes slowly hood. She did need that. She needed to yell it all out, and though it feels awfully weird, like a knot in her guts, to have someone there to hear, it's OK. Though it's still on her mind, an ever present thorn that's gonna stick her relentless every time she sits down, puts her feet up, closes her eyes -- it's nice that they're not talking about werewolves.

""I don't know,"" she replies wryly, voice slowly loosening up. ""A coat? I think it's better to keep you around. See -- I really, really hate grocery shopping. And -- hey."" The woman looks mildly petulant, her voice gone defensive, ""...I like Hamburger Helper.""

Still, the conversation rolls back over to show its serious side, and she finally turns around so her back's no longer facing him, both elbows supporting her back on the counter. ""I'm a grouch. I admit it. It's my way. But I wouldn't kick ya out. So know there's no rush to be had, OK?"" Besides the fact that she kinda likes feeling responsible for someone, gigantic and red or not.



""I take a lot of space and I eat a lot of food, and god knows when I got a pack of stogies, I stink,"" Hellboy admonishes, wagging one big right hand, as if to say, 'Be careful what you wish for, Magadelen St. Matthews, for you just may get it'... ""S'like having a giant, red mastiff. Only if you call me Clifford, I'm liable to punch ya."" And then, at her notation, he pauses, and smirks. ""Hamburger helper it is, then. Stroganoff or triple-cheese lasagna?""

Depending her answer, he begins to prep anyway, leaving the cig to smolder and go cold in the ashtray, washing his hand -- a very strange exercise in and of itself, and rinsing off the big stone MITT with some sudsy water -- and then gets the hamburger outta the freezer and drops it in the sink, under the stream of hot water to warm. He then considers what else -- something green. A can of beans from the cupboard, and they go into a pot to simmer and warm. 

Magda's so lucky. Not every day a big red cook, body guard, and all purpose can open falls out of the sky.
Not every day whatsoever. And damned if she knows it. Out of her own element, she decides evading the kitchen is necessary, only making her pit stop to snag for her second bottle of lager, her taste for beer resurrected by the first. She's a liquor drinker, but for now it'll do. ""Lasagna,"" Magda replies softly, beginning to return to her stony, if not gentle happy medium. Calming, and rather thankful to be back without the world of reason, she shoulders up against the refrigerator and questioningly holds out her lager to her newest tenant and personal chef. ""Couldja pop this one, Cliff?"" She breathes out sharply at herself, amused on the spot. ""Christ, you shouldn't a said that. Nuh uh. Clifford. Shit, that's catchy.""


Hellboy glances over his shoulder, a brow lifting -- before his tail snakes out to catch the beer she's seeking to imbibe. ""Hellboy. HB, if you must. But... no Cliff. Sheesh. And I thought Fishsticks was a bad nickname."" He does take the beer, though, and pop it open with that same easy strength -- ooh, ahh, meta powers at work! -- and then goes back to cooking. Hamburger Helper and green beans takes about forty-five minutes to give you sustenance, though, so she's not put out too long.

""You know,"" he says, once he's dishing up a big bowl of it for both, ""If you liked Vegas but don't like Beacon, why are you here? If -- that's not getting overly personal. I just -- haven't been able to jive why you'd leave a job situation that was good, especially given your line of work..."" Unless it went sour. ""... eh, nevermind. I don't need to know that shit. Just being nosy."" He gets himself a lager, then and pops the top off of it, happy to have his beer -- liquor is lost on him, alas, but then, so is ales of all sorts. Sad to say, it just doesn't do much for him.


Entertained, by both his tail taking her lager away and the general happy-go-lucky feel of her kitchen -- and, boy, is that a new one -- Magda slowly eases herself into it. She lets herself watch, if not participate in life's little soft spots. After all, she knows it won't last long. This guy'll find something, he strikes her as the self-sufficient type, if not utterly proactive, and he'll be out there hopefully doing something for all the crazy oddities in town, and she'll be back to the quiet, the take-out for dinner, and the bottom of her scotch bottle. Getting her beer back, she takes a drink, leaning back and listening and --

Letting it all leave her like a punch in the gut. Her eyes don't leave him, nothing so dramatic, but they dull on the spot. ""It's fine,"" she says, although it's not. ""Just that, euh. It wasn't good. So it had to change. You know."" She pulls herself away from the refrigerator, taking decisive refuge back to the kitchen table.


Yeah. Somethin' told him not to go there, but he did anyway. ""Sorry,"" he says simply, and leaves it at that. He nosed, she retreated, now he knows not too. He gets his bowl, his fork, and settles in. And then he asks a far more innocuous question, ""What is it that you DO like to eat? Other then hamburger helper, which i now know. Cause shoppin' can be my bag. I do well enough on little."" He smirks slightly. ""Sat on quite the funds back home, cause I lived like a damn starving student-- 'cept for my weaknesses for stogies. Those, I like expensive."" Sigh. Cigars. ""Wish my box had survived the trip here. Damn things were wrapped up in my duffel. They soaked. So sad. Coulda buried them in the backyard and gone into mourning...""


Magda remains curled up on the chair even as dinner is served, her knees bent up to hug closely to her body. She seems to be as impartial to eating as the act of shopping, and enjoys the fact that someone's cooking for her far more than the fact she's getting food. No rush to eat out of this one. ""I like..."" she starts quietly, head canting in indecision. As if she eats at all. ""Cinnamon buns. And eggs. And those little chocolate crunchy things. Shaped like fingers, come in a big box."" The toes wiggle on one socked foot, and she partakes of her lager, eyes off somewhere either in thought or memory. ""You don't know starving student. I got my degree from scholarship. Meaning I had to forget what eating was. Got to the point I -- I can't believe I'm telling someone this. Dog food. You try it on toast. The wet kind."" She scratches her jaw with a shoulder, eyes hooded with beer and nostalgia, despite everything and then some. ""You like those, yeah? I'll setcha up a box.""


""I like cinnamon buns,"" Hellboy agrees with her taste there. ""They're always good. 'specially with lots of glaze."" He considers; he's not sure about the crunchy-chocolate-things, that could be anything. Eggs, yeah. But he watches her as she recalls, and says, ""I didn't, I guess. I had army food instead. First twelve years of my life alternated between military bases and research facilities. Food wasn't too good -- but it was a step above dog food. They did see what I could ingest, though, and survive. Turned out to be a lot."" Blargh. Scientists. Poopy scientists. He likes them not! 

Still, the scientists and his suffering -- or the idea of dogfood on toast -- is swept at the way at the sound of 'setcha up a box'. His tail uncurls only to curly-q with interest, and he perks visibly. Ooh, stogies. Sweet, sweet stogies! ""If it's not too much for you,"" he says warningly, though the want is plain. Oh, sweet god. ""Stogies and Baby ruth. And pancakes. You now know all my secret weaknesses."" So they're even, then."

"event","<lj-cut text=""In which Hellboy realizes there are rules in Beacon Harbor that restrict him."">


""Huh. I'll ... have to look into it,"" He says slowly. ""But so long as it didn't bite you, you're good. At least, but the rules of my world. God only knows about this one."" He drops his hand to his belt, touching the rosary looped there, an ever-present source of comfort. At least, at least, he has this,. It's something. An anchor, each bead worn smooth by his father's fingers, now sleek and grainless under his. But he relaxes then, and says, ""Don't worry. Your gun may not hurt him -- but my gun? My gun makes holes the size of your /torso/.""



Magda is sure the monster didn't bite. She can still remember it, the thing's neck muscles pulsing against her foot as she, by one leg, her wiry strength, and the sheer grace of some merciful higher power, held those snapping jaws inches away. She frowns to herself, wrapping her fingers more tightly around the crystal glass. Her eyes pull off the mouthful of wine sloshing in her glass and towards Hellboy, movement attracting her towards his hand on the rosary. She doesn't speak, at least not until he mentions the gun. ""Y'know you're gonna have to register that,"" she notes dryly. And through what means, Christ in a cartoon, does she have no idea.



Hellboy arches a brow. He then draws out the weapon, safety on, and unlocks the champer, cracking the gun practically in half. ""I give a Desert Eagle inadequacy complexes. I also have a government-issued license kill in the line of duty. And you're telling me -- after saying, 'Lay low, Hellboy', that I... am going to need to REGISTER my gun."" He lost the brass, and right now, the thing isn't loaded. He lays the gun on the table -- open and unloaded, probably weighing in at fifteen pounds unloaded, and it's a revolver -- and gets up and digs in his jacket pockets. He produces four shells, each with the funniest tip -- clear something or other, loaded with liquid, a piece of bark, part of a garlic glove, and little metal shavings. ""And when I show 'em what shells I use, what are they going to say? I was off duty when I was snatched up--otherwise I'd have radioactive tracker shellers, armor piercers, rhinos, the works. If it makes a big hole, I've used it."" 

It's a moment of emphasis. Do you really expect them to allow him to register this walking cannon of a gun?


\\\\\\""Inadequacy complexes. Shit,"" Magda gravels, ""today my glock 17 is not a man."" The Samaritan quirks her curiosity, and though she pushes herself up to lean over and get a better look, she doesn't touch it. She makes it a habit not to touch other people's guns unless she must, and for many more reasons than the obvious. She looks over it to give Hellboy a look drier than the bottle of wine on the table. ""I'm right about laying low. It's just the cop in me talking. Unlicensed -- it's gonna be an animal house if the boys pick up one of these and wonder where the hell it came from."" Magda rubs uneasily at her face. An unlicensed gun. It feels like witnessing an escapee out of prison. Every cop instinct makes her feel sick in the gut. ""If you register it, you won't get it back,"" she thinks out loud, talking to herself now. ""Immigrants have problems here with paperwork.""


""I didn't think I would. That gun has no purpose but killing. It's not 'home defense', it's 'blow very big holes in things that almost always scream, but don't always bleed."" He takes the gun back up, left handed -- he doesn't load it, merely takes up the shells carefully in his right hand, even as he snaps the gun closed and slides it back into his belt. ""If it makes you feel better, I won't run around packing heat unless I'm on... the job?"" Does he have a job? Hmm. ""How... hard is it to... get an identity, here?"" he asks mildly, his eyes half lidding. ""Skip around the immigrant status, and cut right to the native?""


""You gotta realize, Red,"" Magda begins uneasily, the wine and her casual nature already slipping in the nicknames, ""you don't have a job here. If the police catch you hunting something, something bad, they're gonna try to arrest you. Because the gun's unregistered, and so are you. I'm no expert--"" her phrase of the year, ""--but I don't think you do. At least I'm not sure. I'm not the person to talk to about this. But it's gonna be hard. They got a lot of precautions, because there's bad shit coming in the offset the good, and no one can tell what's what. We can have Jack the god damned Ripper fly in telling us he's a kindly gynecologist, and we wouldn't no better."" It's a question itself why Magda even has allowed Hellboy into her house now. ""I can check into it if you want me to. See what can be done.""

Hellboy dips his head. ""I would be much obliged. And for your hospitality, too."" He hrumphs softly. ""Really weird -- I've been doin' government work with a free hand since I was twelve years old. A lot of red tape suddenly got me down. Weird, weird, weird."" He shakes his head, looking lost and thoughtful for a moment. ""Funny; even after I quit the bureau, no one ever said anything about my work. Free agent, licensed privately. I wonder... Eh, I'll figure it out once I'm 'nationalized'."" His tail twitches irritably, but -- all in good time. He wants to get things done now, to retake the freedom he's had since he was barely more then a child -- but now? What can he do? Nothing but trust this woman, who's trusted him with her house and her life, like it or not. ""And Jack the Ripper? Feh. He's a two-bit. I've seen a lot worse. A /lot/ worse. You can't imagine what an incubus does to a girl."" He makes a face -- or presumably, makes a /bad/ face. Who can tell with a mug like that?


Magda has an idea. And not just because she's always had a knack for reading body language. She's got a creative mind, and it's already finding her solutions. She responds by immediately paling. ""Just -- don't tell me. I don't want to know. And I hope to Hell those aren't real here."" And if she were to stumble upon an incubus, pray for the sake of the demon. Magda would be very unamused. ""But I believe you. I believe that you probably were an agent back where you lived, at least wore a white hat of some sort. Gut feeling tells me so. But there's still laws here. We got a lot of obstruction of justice here, a lot of vigilantes swooping in from elsewhere thinking they're they law, and it makes the boys here testy. I still haven't seen a whole lot, but some part of me understands. Hell, the cop in me's feeling a little knotted about you possibly using a weapon without a registration on it."" Ever the self-confessed girl scout, sits back heavily, rubbing her unbandaged temple. Las Vegas was so much easier than this. Past all the glitter, it was black and white. ""And I mean it when I say lay low. I'm not going to get into it, because it's dangerous to know --"" apparently she's trying to protect him right now, "" -- but this city. Some of the authorities. Keep an eye out.""


""You know, you make being a hermit in the woods sound more attractive the more you talk, you know that?"" Hellboy sighs, setting his elbow on the table and leaning his blocky jaw into his equally blocky hand. He considers for a time, his eyes half-lidded, though not lazy with that look. Merely tired. ""This all makes my head hurt. This place really needs a bureau. I never thought I'd say that -- but at least us freaks had a place to go then, who did occasionally care about more then research and law."" On a good day. He knows, in his heart, that a lot of the time it was just as bad as what was outside the complex. Too often for his taste.


""You're not a freak. And there's something like that here; I remember hearing something about it. I don't know what it offers, but I think it caters to immigrants. Solemn... no. Soulful. Solace. Something-or-other. Worth checking out. Don't worry,"" is all that she offers, two simple words out of a woman who successfully crumpled her truck and became the meal ticket for a starving vampire. At least she sounds sure of herself. She assumes total responsibility, already swearing her own scout's blood oath to hunt up answers by daybreak. But for now, she just eyes him studiously, taking in his frustration for exhaustion. ""I'll sort it out. But for now, let's get ya bedded down, yeah?"" Her hands clamp on the arms of her chair, and after a good, strained push, she forces her body up to her feet. The pain is unheeded -- at least for now. Magda has surprising determination when she feels useful, and despite her willingness to repress everything about this night, some part of her really likes the idea of being responsible for someone. Someone who looks like he could pop lock off a safe in his right hand, but someone nonetheless. Someone... who's really not going to fit on her couch. On her feet, she stalls both in body and mind. ""Where am I gonna put you. Guess.. um. No. Or... I could get some cushions together and linens, put you down on the floor in the living room. It's got carpet.""



Hellboy nods, filing that away. Solace. Soulful. Something with an S. We hope. ""I'll look into that,"" he says simply, and then rises -- he takes her suggestion at bed as her tiredness, but doesn't argue. She needs sleep. And even though he's only been up a few hours, it's been hard hours, indeed. He tucks in his chair once he's out of it, and takes the uneaten burgers over to the counter. He finds cellophane God only knows where, and wraps them up, for tomorrow. They can be reheated, somehow. ""If you just wanna toss me the stuff, I can set myself up. I take up plenty of space, but I don't requite much more then a flat surface and some quiet."" So there it is. He's easy. Give him a corner, he'll curl up in it.



""Just a corner? Now that's an idea. No. Wait. Why waste a whole corner. I can just toss you downstairs and you can use the concrete. Better yet, I throw you back outside into the rain."" Magda manages all that with a poker face straight from Nevada's card tables, dead serious. Then she breathes out sharply, her way of amusement, and the ghost of a smirk touches her lips. Apparently her house has a strict No Martyr policy. ""There's furniture in the living room,"" she informs him wryly as she hobbles slowly out of the kitchen, going back for the stairs. ""Take the cushions off the couches. I'll be back down with some linens. --Sleep in a corner,"" she echoes to herself, voice rumbling. Like hell.



""Yes, ma'am."" Something told him not to petulantly whine 'but mom'. She wouldn't like it. But he does dismantle the couch, and settle quietly onto the floor, mauling the cushions into a semblance of comfort; one under his massive hand -- as not to leave huge dents in said carpet -- and the other under his head. Really, he doesn't think she'd take kindly to him telling her that he's slept on sand, on rock, on trees -- in mud. He was willing, more then willing, to just go to the homeless shelter and take up a corner (a large corner) /there/. But at least this is warm and dry and smells faintly of woman. Can't really go wrong with these things.



Fresh out of sand, rocks, trees, and mud, her pile of mismatched linens will have to do. When she can't decide, she overcompensates, and thus step after hitched step, Magda returns carrying the whole god damned closet. The heap of blankets is about as tall as she is, and luck be a lady that she hasn't tripped and broken that twiggy neck of hers on the wobbly step down. She dumps the load beside him, a landfill of downy comforters and flannel sheets. Thick, durable, military fabrics that do their job. The woman rights herself with a sharp breath out, one hand on the small of her back like a geriatric. Sore but eager, she makes sure to ask, ""Need anything else?""



""No, no! Go to bed, woman... sheesh."" She acts like a mother, he'll say that, his tail curling up slightly at the sight of all those comfy blankets. ""I'll get settled. Go ahead and sleep. You need it more then I."" The impulse to say, 'I'll wake you in a couple hours to make sure you're not concussed or in a coma', he realizes, would probably get him kicked, slapped, thrown out or shot when he tried it. So instead he just begins to wade through the covers, finally getting comfortable, and collapsing in a heap among them. 

It's not a bad start to a new world. Sleeping on some strange woman's floor. He's been stranger places. At least there are no dingos here, like in the dreamtime. They stank. Magda, thankfully, does not stink."

Project Infinity - Friday, May 07, 2004, 8:57 PM
------------------------------------------------

Elm Hollow Road

        At the intersection of Corner Lane, Tidal Lane turns west and intersects East Main Street. Here, the busy traffic keeps the place in constant activity, even at night. The homes along these streets are a little more worn, a little less polished, than those found in the neighborhoods to the north. For most in the city, this is viewed as a less economically advantaged neighborhood. A strange disease devastated the elm trees that once lined the streets here, and while there are a few here and there, they are a rare sight.

Contents:
Magda
Obvious exits:
Entirely Unremarkable Little House <LH>  Willow Street <N>  Corner Lane <SOUTH>  Hollow Hill <E>  Main Stretch <W>  Holmes' Apartment <HA>  MacDonald's <MCD>


Magdalen St. Matthew has been a very morose woman. As she should be. She's working one of the statistically rated ten most dangerous jobs in the United States. She lives alone in the city with the national highest death toll. She was involved in a spectacular crash had her head bleeding constantly for at least a half an hour. She was nearly killed. She just put herself in charge of a freshly-ejected immigrant, and just about the biggest damn whatever she's ever seen. She's got Morro on her ass, and she's almost sure he's covering up a murder he committed. And she's really, really wet.

But not one of the above is the reason why she's barely muttered a word. Flexed a lip. Batted an eye. Ever since she got the first, real, sane look at her battered Ford, Magda has been a hurtin' machine. 

She's the broken, hollow shell of a woman, a grief-striken widow in mourning, an adulterous one at that. While her baby, her one true love hangs on just above a flatline, she's already stroking the shick shift of another man.

She sadly mans an older, wearier rental truck up main street and towards Elm Hollow, speaking only to blandly point out locale after locale to her unlikely passenger. Soon the rental truck grinds into a halt in the middle of suburbia, a fresh-faced, rosy-cheeked row of condominiums standing proudly in single-file. The homely street's dead empty. It always is at night. ""Home,"" she announces, deadpan.


Hellboy has quiet, but unknown to most, this is his default state. He is quiet; observant in an almost cop-like manner himself, his eyes open his head up, and despite everything he's been through, he takes in his surroundings and makes note of most everything. He's strange that way -- perhaps not to Magda, but to others, his watch of language, his interest in currency... it's obvious he's 'new', but he acclimates with disturbing quickness; this isn't much different from home, but it's different enough.

Once out of the car, with barely but a nod of affirmative, he looks around /here/, too. He takes a breath, and slowly lets it out. ""You get first dibs on the shower. You got a coffee maker? I think I'm gonna need some joe to get me through the rest of the night."" He's not sleeping. I was nine am an hour ago for him. Nine am! Not fuckall after dark! But he doesn't say that. He's still got it rattling around that thick head of it, under the raspy black stubble of his near-bald crown.



""Nnnrm,"" is Magda's rather eloquent reply. She closes the truck after her, caring less if it's locked. She hopes it gets stolen. She doesn't say a word more on her journey up towards her house, and though by all appearances, she looks like she doesn't give a damn, her eyes are this way and that, checking for neighbors, any gawping eyes plastered to windows. The street's thankfully got a seven p.m. curfew, and that's why she chose it.

She does have a coffee maker. And that's about it.

The woman lives like a hutterite, but despite it all, she has taste. The walls are a fresh, smooth hue of cream, rounded off with corners carved off like Hellenic columns. The ceilings are high like a cathedral's, and an cast iron chandelier -- lit by candles -- hangs down in the heart of the living room over her large, heavy leather couch. Where there is not teak hardwood on the floors, the carpet is fluffy. Untouched. No children. No roommates. She more than likely lives alone, and never spends her time here.

The place is lush, but there's something missing. Life. She's got no microwave, no television, and most certainly no computer. Her stereo's the only piece of equipment, and it's old, and it's still taped up since the move.

She seems to favour old things. Archaic things. Dead things. A ancient gas oven. Candles instead of wall lights. Books upon books with dusty covers. An antique kitchen table -- now drowned in a deluge of thick manilla folders. An old record player. Her sense of humour.

Magda enters unceremoniously, turning on the only electrical light in the foyer. It makes her grimace slightly, but it just might be the low light. She immediately goes for the kitchen, dumping her keys loudly on the counter top. ""Yeah, got one. Just take a load off, it's all safe here.""



""Go shower and clean up,"" Hellboy says, putting his sodden suitcases and bags, kneeling down briefly to roll the locks and pop them open. In one -- well, a few odd cases, some very old books, and a few odd knicks, all secured in their places. He grumbles at sone of the leakage, though -- water damage to books priceless in his world, possibly unique in this one. But then he shuts it all the same, and opens the other -- far more mundane things again; clothes, a photo album, and a small tape recorder and lots and lots of tape peek through the mesh pocket. He shuts it in turn, and then grabs his duffel. ""You got a washer and dryer? After you shoulder, that is. I'd like to use it."" Since his clothes have been dragged through the mud and all.

But regardless of answer, he makes sure his hooves are clean, and steps lightly, clicking gently over the wood floors, toward the kitchen. Time to put coffee on. The files are eyed, but not approached. ""You bring a lot of work home with you?""



""Yup,"" the woman replies. ""Washer and dryer downstairs."" One of her long hands raps her knuckles on a closed door -- the one to the basement -- as she passes back into the foyer to do away with her coat. ""Deep freeze's down there too. If you're hungry, you'll have to pull something out. I keep everything frozen."" Her own personality included.

She watches Hellboy out of the corner of her eyes whenever she can, some part of her trying to make something straight out of him. She feels odd about taking a shower, especially because it'd leave him alone in the house, but she seems to trust this unusual stranger enough to invite him in the first place. It's just been too long since she's shared space with anything, and change makes her teeth itch. An itch... she ignores, because what's she going to do, toss him out in the rain, hooves and all? God, he's got hooves.

Out of her mean leather jacket, Magda is tiny and tornadoed. Her soaked clothes and shoulder holster stick jealously to her body, her hair is a mess, and the drippy bandaging at her temple needs changing. She's also slicked with blood. Her own. The paramedic's. The vampire's bullet holes during her fight inside the Volvo and out. The whole goddamn night shot to hell. Still, she finds the amusement to peer at Hellboy after his last question, veer her eyes toward the kitchen table, and back again. ""Yep. And sometimes I bring it home on me."" She rubs the back of her neck, shoes scraping as she walks down the hall, hitting a staircase that takes her to the third floor. ""Shower sounds smart. I'll be ten minutes.""



Peeling out of his coat -- which he hangs at the nearest available hook over dry floor, so he can mop up the drippings in a bit -- he stands, shirtless, body whorled with strange, shadowy pictograms and wiry black hair that sticks out like burnt trees in the middle of a forest fire. But his naturalness in this half-clad seems to be ... well, normal to him. ""I'll make the coffee. And if possible, make food. You probably seriously fried what energy reserves you had left..."" And there he goes, ferreting out the stairs -- aha! Have-at-thee, stairs, I've got you now! He trudges down them, wet and dirty and tired, but -- hey, this is good enough. He cracks open the freezer, digs about, finds some hamburger. Goes upstairs, and then considers. He washes his hands, then considers the hamburger. No microwave to thaw it with, and -- well, she's showering. Dammit. He grunts once, then puts on the coffee. At least that self-heats. And then it's standing room only. He doesn't want to park his wet, squishy ass anywhere yet. So he drags his clothing over to the sink and goes about wringing some out, Thankfully, it's not too dirty -- some rinsing and ... well, it's good. Then, downstairs he goes, to toss everything in the dryer... 

And take that moment to lean against the wall, head on his arm and just -breathe-. He needs that moment to collect himself, and not explode in a giant seething ball of 'I want my dad and I want my fishman and I want my matchstick and I want them all /right now/.'



Magda stares at herself in the mirror. Blood. Bruises. Brutality. Busy day. Slowly, carefully, every joint yelling its own ache, she hooks out of her holster and then her shirt, letting her chillbumped body free itself within the confines of her bathroom. The blacks and blues from her car crash have already painted her body in long hues, her flesh battered and tenderized ten times over. Just about the only part of her that isn't bruised is her abdomen. And only because it cannot. The thick, coarse, bloodless scar tissue wears only its own ugliness. She touches there briefly, compulsively, the only part of her naked body that receives real attention.

Ten minutes on the mark, a strict officer that lives by her word, Magda's bare feet creak along the kitchen floor. Dressed in old, frayed jeans and a tight tee that reads Hard Rock Cafe: Las Vegas, she elastics back her damp hair and checks the new layer of bandaging at her temple. The woman grimaces, but the smell of coffee comforts her, like coming home to a full house. Only now, the kitchen's oddly empty. ""Hel-- Hey? You?"" she calls, her hands on her hips, eyes on the frozen package of hamburger sitting on the counter. She knows this guy's name, sure, but it just doesn't feel right to say it. What the hell kind of name is that anyway. It's just about as bad as Magdalen. ""You 'round here?""



""Hellboy is my name, you can use it. Or you can call me 'H.B.'; people are sometimes more comfortable with that."" It's from down in the basement, almost cavernous. The dryer whud-whud-whuds softly with it's load, almost soundless but not... quiet. He on the other hand, sits in his wet, dirty clothes and waits. It won't take long for his BPRD shirt and another pair of shorts to be dry, if not the cleanest in the world. Eventually, the snap-bang of the dryer sounds and he trudges up with passable clothing. ""Didn't want to give you a cheap thrill with cold water,"" he says simply, ""So when I'm outta the shower, I'll thaw that meat, wash my clothes, and cook you dinner. You're gonna need somethin' -- and you probably shouldn't sleep."" He considers, even as he passes her, ""You probably should go to a doctor to make sure you're not concussed. Comas are no fun, see."" And then he's trudging up the stairs, fully expecting her to blow off the idea of seeking medical attention.



And she does. ""I'm fine,"" she says dismissively, the consideration disregarded as quickly as she can spit it out. Magda has a reasonable amount of patience that she treasures her greatest virtue, but she knows it'd snap inside some emergency room squashed between two assholes hacking and coughing down her neck. The thought alone irritates her. She settles her thin body against her kitchen counter, leaning there haphazardly and trying to get a sense of the whole situation. She's seen a lot, been through tons more, but it's pretty much the first time a giant red tailed guy who's fallen out of the sky told her he's going to make her some dinner. Magda rubs miserably at her forehead, only looking back up in time to watch her new tenant disappear upstairs, peering after his tail.

Magda shakes her head. Alone again, she goes for the refrigerator. There's never been a sadder, unstocked piece of appliance in existence. It's the bare necessities plus a whole lot of booze. She avoids anything edible and goes straight for the wine, clearing a spot for herself at the kitchen table. With a grateful, finalizing sigh, she sits her fatigued self down, pouring herself a glass to keep her company while she waits.



Hellboy has a lot more to wash them Magda, so he takes a rather quick twenty-minute shower. That's not counting the wringing of his sodden, wet clothing in the shower, nor leaving it to be soaked again by the spray as both the clothes and he gets clean, and then wringing of those clothes AGAIN, and laying them out before he gets dressed, happy to be in dryer-warm shorts and a t-shirt. He ties back his ponytail of hair slopply, not caring about the knot he wears overmuch, and then trudges downstairs. 

""If I damage the floors, I'm sorry,"" he begins, even as he goes past to actually WASH clothes now that there's no one using up hotwater. But a few minutes later, he rises from the depths again, and then spies the wind. It's hard to tell with that craggy face if he's glaring or not -- those overhang brows make everything a glower. ""Booze and head injury. They teach you basic medical at the academy?""



""It's a floor,"" is her only reply, one shoulder rolled in a shrug. No tears to be wept there. She finishes her first glass of red wine appreciatedly, pouring another, ambidextrously multitasking with her other hand through stacks of paper. She grunts and fidgets and reaches and pushes aside folders until she digs out a package of cigarettes. It's simply heresy to drink and not smoke at the same time. Leaning back with a heavy huff, head pounding and body aching, she snags out a cold cig and lets it dangle from her lips, before offering the pack towards Hellboy with a slanted look. Her eyes stop when they catch his face, possibly the first time she's sat and taken a good look at him in the light. The expression on her face is curious and solemn. And then it twists with wryness. ""Musta slept through that class,"" she rumbles back dryly. ""Probably hungover or something."" Magda's a smartass. ""Want a glass?""



""At least red will go with.. whatever I'm making..."" Yeah. He said he was making dinner. He grunts, and then nods. ""Sure. If you don't mind wastin' good booze on a big guy."" But he goes about rummaging, finding some bowtie -- who the hell buys bowtie? -- noodles and eventually ... giving up on much else. ""You need to go shopping, woman. How long you been here."" Is it too much to hope for a bottle of marinara? Or will he just can it all and make burgers? Grr. Grr. Of all the people to end up with, he ends up with the cop who lives like a starving student.



""A few weeks,"" she tells up as she gets up, biting back a seethe as she slowly picks herself up. It's getting increasingly harder to stand, now that the shock's gone and the ache's setting in. She feels like she was hit by a mack truck. Magda steps wearily towards her cabinets and takes out a crystal wine glass, something too pretty to belong in this house. She makes a pit stop at a drawer to snatch up a book of matches and a rattling bottle of painkillers, settling it all down on the table before she flops like a rag doll. ""I don't cook, so I don't stock,"" she speaks around her cigarette, lighting it impatiently. ""And you're the lucky first guy I've entertained in over a year."" She gets to pouring Hellboy a glass of wine, refilling her own, and then fighting the child-proof lid of her pills. ""So where do you come from?""



""Cheers. You're the first woman who isn't a coworker or 'family member' that I've cooked for since I left my last girlfriend in..."" He pauses, thinks. ""'81. So if time flows the same around here... I think I have you beat."" He pauses, looking slightly disconcerted, and glances over his shoulder. ""It is 2004, right? Year of our lord, blah blah blah?"" Don't let him think about that. Time or dimension travel? ...Stranger things, man, stranger things /have/ happened.

But he goes about finding bread, abandoning the idea of spaghetti, and instead gets a pan out to make good ol' burgers, since they have some bread to make passable buns with. If the damn woman had a spicerack and some tomato paste, he could finagle sloppy joes, but... Ah, woman.

It's about the time she's poured the wine that he realizes, he made coffee. ""Dammit."" Well, hell, not like the mix will matter. The cup is swept up in his human, right hand, even as the big stone hand handles the spatula. Right now, drink is drink, and neither's drug affects him much.



The pill bottle stops rattling. ""Eighty-one?"" Magda echoes incredulously, her eyes slapping Hellboy with a sudden glance. How old was she then? Five? ""How --"" she starts to ask his age, before some semblance of etiquette takes her by the ear. Who the hell, and what the hell is this guy? Whatever he is, is getting more interesting by the second, and that trait alone keeps her from her reprise into the world of monotones and one-word answers. ""Naa, it's Oh-Four here, don't worry."" She turns slightly towards Hellboy, one of her long legs hooked over the arm of her kitchen chair. ""It's gonna be OK. This place is Earth, a pretty normal, run of the line Earth -- except for Portal Bartertown here -- and I guess... that's only comforting if you come from the same thing. You're from an Earth, right? Or somewhere else? Does it have a United States? And -- euh. I'm sorry. You're kinda my first immigrant. I'm not too good at the Welcome to Earth, Try the Buffalo Wings speech.""



""Whether I'm from Earth or not was never decided,"" Hellboy says as he makes hamburger patties one handed; he can't use the other -- it's rough surface doesn't exactly come with a teflon coating. ""But that's really here not there. I called Earth home. I was ... 'born' in England, raised the first few years of life in New Mexico, and spent the rest of it calling Fairfield, Connecticut my home. And if it's '04, I'm turning sixty in December. But yes. It was an earth, with a U-S-of-A, Commander Freedom, Torch of Liberty, Bush was running our country into a hole, making it hard for me to work despite Vatican backing, and I had spent the better part of my life serving my country."" He pauses, and glances back as a patty hits the pan with a sharp sizzle. ""You had the World Wars, right? One and Two? I fought in the end of Two. Well... the end no body knew about, anyway.""



""You're in luck,"" she says after a long, emphatic pause. He fought in World War II? She'd probably be feeling the pangs of inadequacy if she had some testosterone in her. Luckily a woman in this case, she chooses instead to hang onto her curiosity, watching Hellboy as she pops a couple pills and swirls them back with a heavy mouthful of wine. ""Knew...about? Euhh.. Um, we got World Wars, the Vatican, served country, a Bush -- OK, maybe you're not so much in luck. But it seems you pretty much come from... here? Or something like that. That could've been a lot worse. I've heard of stories of people coming in from centuries ago, pre dark ages. Scientists, sociologists, shrinks... do entire studies on these sorts of things. That's why I bet it's smarter to lie low for now and get a sense of everything first."" She back-and-forths between her wine and cigarette, the alcohol and nicotine doing absolute wonders for her headache, and her mood. ""I can pick you up some articles and reports about the portals. Generally what the smart guys here think they do. I just know a bit. They bring things here from all over. Some disappear. There's a chance you can go back... but you're pretty much stuck.""



""All right,"" he says. ""I've been worse places."" The second pattie is made -- he's making six total, but he's already counting on eating four of them himself. He digs out american cheese, and asks, ""You want any on your burgers-- you know, I'm not even sure I've got your name in all this crap."" If he did, it's slipped his mind like wet soap in a prisoner's hands, damning him for losing it. ""I'm sorry. I'm making your food, I'm using your washer, and I've used your shower, and I'm forgetting what pass for my manners."" The wine in his hands, over this, has become empty. He has put the crystal aside -- he hasn't asked for a second glass, rather, digging out a mug and drinking lukewarm coffee instead.


Magda has very skilled hands, especially when it comes to chain smoking. She keeps resolving to quit, every morning, every evening, especially every time she needs to run, but her test of control goes into how fast she can relight the next cigarette while still nursing the butt of the last. ""Magda,"" she tells him through a mouthful of smoke. Her tongue wets over her lower lip. ""And I know. You exchange blood types before pleasantries in this town."" She settles deeper into her chair, the stiff, stoic cop like a pussy cat with a bit of wine in her. Her leg slung over her chair arm swings mindlessly, the toes crooked on the bare foot like they've all been broken at one time. ""And, hey. Don't forget you also saved my life back there. Don't think I'm repressing that. Manners don't bug me."" Magda herself is rather aware she's not being the perfect hostess, and she comes to the decision that she could care less. There's being a good person, and then there's just being anal about it. ""And what did you ask me -- right, right,"" she gravels to herself, finishing her glass of wine. ""I'm not really -- um. Yeah, cheese? Sure.""


Cheese now blankets each patty, yellow and bright against the black iron skillet. Hellboy doesn't notice or care, just nodding his head, black hair brushing against the equally black collar of his shirt. But eventually, he pops those puppies off, puts two between slices of bread, and presents them on plates. ""More if you want 'em,"" he says simply, before bringing his coffee and plate over himself, to sit down and guzzle up. He takes down the decent sized patties in a blink, and is quick to put a second between slices and munch on that himself. ""And I don't have a blood type. It doesn't match any known to man.""


Magda accepts the plate with a strained look, unsmiling, but still knowing enough to say, ""Thanks."" She's a little more spooked by the fact she's getting cooked for than by just whom is doing the cooking. She fights to find room on her kitchen table, mumbling an apology as she reaches to drop a few of the bundled folders onto the third, empty chair. She cleans house as well and as often as she cooks. It takes her more time than she realizes to do something as simple as sit up, her muscles already hating it, gritting her jaw to avoid grunting any of her disdain. She arranges herself to peer down at her dinner. She's really not hungry, her appetite been lost for about a year, the lean state of her body all too sorely representing that. Still, she uses dinner as an excuse to pour herself some more wine, which she dines on in between intermittent bites of the haphazardburgers. Not bad. ""No blood type?"" she echoes, grey eyes turning up. She watches him as her face tightens with thought. ""So what do you do?""



""What do I do for a living, or what do I do about lack of bloodtype?"" He asks, and that rocky face MIGHT be grinning. Or he might have gas. It's hard to tell, especially if one doesn't KNOW Hellboy -- which is to say, Magda doesn't know him yet. He considers the former question, and then says, ""I used to kill monsters, for the good ol' red-white-and-blue. Though I went all over the world to do it. Ghosts, goblins, vampires, harpies, you named it, I've had it's proverbial head on my wall."" He sips his lukewarm coffee, and then considers. ""It was a lot like being a CIA agent, only no spy hunting, just monster hunting. Still, a lot of investigation, exploration, a side of archaeology, a heaping dose of history. All the good stuff. Indiana Jones, only with things from under your bed.""



Eyes never leaving him, Magda slumps finalizingly back into her chair. She blinks acutely, once, twice, and again, the glass of wine stayed in one of her long-fingered hands. ""Really,"" is all that she says. And then she laughs -- or doesn't. His grinning is gas, and her laughter is a harsh, snikt of a breath hissed out, a cough more than anything else. ""Buddy, you've come to the right place. And I mean the /right/ place."" She hurriedly drinks a bit of her wine before placing the glass down, biting her lip as she rolls her sleeve down from her forearm. She shows it bemusedly off to Hellboy, the skin there scissored, scabbed over with healing gouges. They're not long, but they're deep, a couple of stitches snuck in there. ""Giant goddamned wolf. I haven't even been here a month.""


Wow. You've got him all ears now -- at least, all eyes. ""Giant wolf? Like, dire wolf, werewolf, really big ass rabid dog? What we talkin' here?"" He's now lost some of his casualness -- he's quiet, but he's hardly formal -- and his attention is on these lovely wounds, criss crossing her skin. ""I've offed plenty of demon olves in my day; werewolves, Wolves of St. August..."" He reaches out, and then pauses. ""May I?"" She's the type of woman who you have to ASK before you breech a certain distance; he's known her hours and already he realizes that she won't be manhandled anymore then he'll let anyone do it to him.



""Um, sure,"" she says at length, pausing noticeably. Magda is a loner, she gets headaches around crowds as much she does electric appliances, but she's not averse to touching as she pretends to be. She just doesn't get offered it all that often, even in the sake of professionalism. She yanks her sleeve up past her elbow and stretches her arm over the table, offering it to Hellboy wound-up. ""Giant -- something. It was -- he was a guy first, and he changed into one. So I guess you'd call that, what, werewolf?"" The term seems to silly, so Hollywood to hold true. She almost hopes there's some meaner scientific term that she can't pronounce. It'd make the whole thing less laughable. ""It was something else. I swear, I had that thing held off of me by just my left foot. Could smell its breath. Apparently it -- him. Whatever. Thinks I'm someone else, so it oughta be the start of something interesting."" Only Magda could take near-death in good humour. Especially with her belly full of wine.


""Ayup. Werewolf, skinchanger, wolfman, loup garou, the beast of geschevalle, whatever. Did he change by day, or by night?"" he asks, even as he begins to gently inspect the wounds. ""Claw or bite? Wounds from a werewolf can communicate the disease, depending the type. ""You got relatives you don't -- or do know -- that are into things they shouldn't be?"" he asks then, carefully handling. Looks like claws; not ragged or shaped like a bite. He releases her arm then, and leans back, taking his coffee cup and getting up to fill it back up. Well, at least this is interesting. ""You know anything else? What he looks like? Could you identify him?"" He sounds like a cop, sadly enough -- but this is his job. Investigating the weird.



Under the sudden barrage of questions, Magda looks about as confused as a baby in a topless bar. She doesn't know which to answer first. ""No. No -- relatives. I don't -- it was night. I couldn't really see, because it was night. Night, raining, happened so fast, I thought he was hurt, guy with a gun -- I couldn't really, um -- wait."" And then she stops. Aches be damned, she sits up like a gunshot, a terrible look splattered over her face like a gunpowder burn. ""Communicate. Is that what you said. Meaning what? I can catch that? It's /catchable?!/ I'm gonna turn into that. /I'm/ gonna... I'm gonna turn into that?!""


She's spooked. Shit. ""Whoa. No. I can't know for sure without getting dipshit -- however, if he didn't /bite/ you --if he only clawed you -- you are NOT going to change."" Note to self: just in case, stalk up on silver and wolf's bane. Hellboy eyes her critically. ""C'mon, you're a cop. You gotta keep calm in a hard situation like that. Did this guy get his mouth on you at any time? Or did he just claw you? It's gotta be a saliva transfer."" Please, god, calm down or Hellboy's going to shoot /himself/ with his bigass gun that he never takes off.


""Of course I'm a bloody cop! I'm a Vegas cop, not a Beacon cop! I'm only a few weeks under the golden shield, so give me a break here,"" she grunts out, pointing a finger his way. It does good, her getting irritated at Hellboy, because the pique of anger brings the woman back from her bout of delirium. She reaches for her glass of wine without even thinking, alcohol her security blanket. Jaw tight, steely eyes honed down at her unfinished meal, Magda thinks. ""The teeth didn't get me. Claws it. I kept the teeth off of me, managed to plug a few bullets in it. Spooked it off. It was just -- such a blur. It could talk. It was talking to me. It was huge."""

Stygian fangs stop just an inch from her jugular. Peeled off of the woman like a shrieking, starving bandaid, the vampire is wheeled around in time to shake faces with the side of an oak. It roars. And again. Shrieks. And again. The monster's durable, and it seems a forever of struggling and fighting as it's slammed sickly into shredding bark. Again and again and again. With one last crunch, its face looking like fresh hamburger, the unconscious demon falls silent. And then a powerful SMASH puts its head right into the cracking bark. When it's reefed back, just the body comes free. It crumbles into dust. Magda just watches it all, still from her half-fallen, half-slouched place, her body breathing harshly from adrenaline and exertion. Her grey eyes tic, and the rain rolls down her face.



Breathing hard, Hellboy is so terribly satisfy when he feels the weight give away in his hands. ""All right. Dead-guy foobar made up for,"" he says, before he turns to offer Magda his dusty--but soon cleansed by the rain--left hand. ""C'mon. Lemme help you get back. Not sure how you're gonna explain two piles of dust, though."" He pauses, and then asks, ""Unless that's... normal around here."" Is it? He's not sure. He's not sure he wants to know. The whole portal thing is in the back of his head, waiting to jump out and bite him. But hell, a tiny bitter part of him rationalizes -- you were walking away from everything anyway. Why not walk away from your whole /world/, too?

Because he liked that world. And people in it. It has his house, his family, his father's grave. Good enough reason to /stay/.



""Unfortunately normal,"" Magda grates out, giving her right shoulder a rub. She glances to one side and sights her gun, taking the damn thing back. Her eyes come to gather on Hellboy's proffered hand, possibly the reddest thing she's seen in her entire life. She exhales, and after a deliberate, noticeable pause, accepts it. Where he's red, she's tiny, and even the smaller hand of his two can easily engulf hers. It's a wonder they make police officers this small. ""The general theory is that these portal whatevers bring in people, bad things, weird stuff, whatevers -- shit from all over. Probably from places you'd have nightmares about. And dumps 'em all right here.""



""You have no idea what I have nightmares about,"" Hellboy says tersely, once Magda's on her feet. His warm -- too warm, especially for being soaking wet, in the cold cold rain in a damn New England town -- hand is taken back, and he looks over the park. ""C'mon. Let's get back to your people. Does -- do -- shit, I don't even know what I'm gonna do here."" No going home? At all? ""There's no going back?"" It's so bleak! This -- this damn /thing/... He ... wants to go back, dammit! He wants to go /home/ right now, park his big red ass in Abe's comfiest chair, and say that Tom Manning is his best friend, and he will never, ever leave the BPRD ever again.

A childish thought, but who doesn't have those when they've been ripped from everything they knew, everything that was familiar? These thoughts in mind, he begins to trudge back, heavy steps leaving cloven-hoof craters in the grass behind him, even as he mutters to himself about his damned luck. Maybe one of these cops knows where he can go -- if this shit happens all the time, he's gotta have /someplace/ he can go...



A crisp, airy breath huffs out over the rain, a poor sign of Magda's sore, shivery, and shellshock amusement. Her people. They won't be there. She hugs the sides of her coat around her body, shoulders ousted like a bird trying to puff its plumbs against the wet. She follows her strange crash victim and savior through the park, her shoes catching and slipping on whatever they can. The woman's a lot more clumsy when she has nothing to chase, and the world tonight is a slick one. She steps carefully over a thick root that loops up out of the earth, grey eyes fixed up. ""I'm sorry you got grabbed. It's not gonna be easy. This city -- it. It don't exactly cater well. But whatever you do, you don't let yourself trust things here that you mighta trusted back home.""



""Well, so far vampires are pretty par for the course,"" Hellboy mutters, tail curling the air and spraying rain with irritable lashing. He doesn't want to take out his frustration on the woman, but his anger management -- well, he just did what he does for anger management. He needs more vampires to turn into so much dust. But, later. Maybe. Sometime? Who knows -- who cares? Eh! Goddamn it. 

Back at the truck, they've pretty much cleaned the place up. At least the paramedics are still there -- well, some of them. A second ambulance came for the wounded paramedic and gentleman, and the others are still sort of shellshocked by what they've just seen. Hellboy goes over to pick up his bags, and then mutters, ""At least I care prepared. Some gear, some clothes, some... stuff of mine. Was moving out of my old place."" He glances back. ""Anybody know where this 'immigrant' can park his red butt for the night?"" Since this happens so often, there's GOTTA be a way... right? Right?


A hand comes out of nowhere, clapping down on Hellboy's left wrist and tightening. It's a fierce, vindictive, extremely...tiny hand belonging to that tiny cop, who at the moment looks largely pissed off. Stubborn jaw knotted into a fierce frown, Magda doesn't seem to realize he's got a good two feet on her as she tries to give a mean tug, wanting to get both his attention and for him to step back. ""Can you listen?"" she asks petulantly, not if he has, but if he's damn well capable of it. ""What part of 'not catering' didja not get?"" A couple paramedics have already taken to staring. Beacon Harbor hosts the supernatural, but most of them don't look like that. Bleedy head turned, Magda glares at them until they go do their jobs. When she looks back at Hellboy, she seems to realize there and then just how damn big he is. It helps sober her out of her ire. ""The less authorities that know you're here, the better.""


Oh. THAT sort of not catering. Hellboy blinks his orange eyes, and slumps slightly, massive shoulders taking the slightest of dips. ""Listen. I'm -really- used to getting the freakjob treatment,"" he explains. ""That is nothing new to me at all. But what the hell am I supposed to do. Beg for couch space? 'Gee, I'm very sorry I hit a volvo after falling out of the sky, and made you wreck your truck -- hey, do you mind if I sleep on your couch?'"" He's never really been good at asking for help. But at least now he's asking for advice. Even if, in his stubborn irritation, he's not likely to accept it. He doesn't want to be here. He wants to be in /Brooklyn/. In his father's house. Away from this. ""Any suggestion, bright eyes?""


As she mentioned rather emphatically, she is no expert when it comes to Beacon Harbor. The nature of its oddities escapes her totally, possibly because some part of her doesn't even want to know. But she does have that feeling, right in her gut, a real sick one that knows something bad is up. Learning about the corruption within the force, the fact that it goes far up the ladder, right up -- and why, who the hell's paying whom and for what -- keeps her on her toes. She doesn't know much, but she knows above all, she's a cop. And it's her nature, her sole purpose to assume all responsibility for everything. This guy crashed down on her watch. He scared the living hell out of her, but it was her little scene that introduced him to this city. He asked her where she was. What to do. He's asking her for advice. He's her responsibility now, and if something happens, it would be her complete fault. Because then she's not doing her job. Her hands drops from his wrist, dangling uselessly to her side. Magda looks Hellboy up and down, from side to side, seeing as much as she can in the dark. And then, she just...exhales harshly, and pinches the bridge of her nose. ""I don't know.""


""That's what I thought."" He pauses, and then checks the strap on his duffel -- he tightens a few things, drags some string out of his pockets, and loops a few others, before he jimmies the bag so it won't empty anytime soon, and packs his sodden clothes back in it, perhaps with a little too much vehemence. Slinging that back onto his shoulder, her takes his suitcases --one with it's handle clamped between two fingers of his huge right hand-- and then says, ""Can you at least point me to the direction of a homeless shelter? That'll have to be good enough for now.""


And she could. She could point a finger, tell him due north, let the big red behemoth be on his way without money, without resources, without a single clue of what he just stepped -- or fell into, and she could be done with it. Wash her hands of it. She could get on with her life, or what's left of it, and place her attention on the most important things. Her truck is totaled. She's exhausted beyond all feeling. She's bleeding. She was just nearly killed, murdered at the hands of something straight out of Hell. If not for him. This undefinable red, tailed man that risked his life for hers, who didn't have to, who's going to be cast out into the lion's den. Magda could easily turn her back, forget, ease the weight of responsibility off her shoulders, but then she'd be another person. It's just not in her nature. ""Goddamnit,"" she grunts out, all good intentions with a grouchy execution. ""Listen."" She pauses. She exhales. ""Come with me. After this's all settled up here. Tonight, I'll give you a spot to crash."""

Project Infinity - Thursday, May 06, 2004, 11:50 PM
---------------------------------------------------

City Seat Circle

        The focal center of the city, the two lengths of Main Street meet here, forming a circular drive around which a number of important public buildings are situated. Erected in the small park in the center of Circle Drive is Beacon Harbor's Lady of Progress, a twenty five foot tall statue of a woman clad in armor, sword upraised, pointing to the brave new future for the city and its inhabitants. A small fountain is positioned in front of the statue, and a number of benches are scattered around the small park, providing lots of places to sit; for lunch, to relax, or for the disenfranchised. Beneath the park is a vast underground structure that provides parking for the many government buildings that line the outer rim of the circle. Circle Drive splits off in three directions from here, northeast toward the financial district, northwest towards the commercial district, and southwest toward the monolithic residential district.

Contents:
Magda
Obvious exits:
East Main <NE>  West Main <NW>  Southland Drive <SW>  Art Museum <AM>  The Beacon Harbor Opera <BHO>  City Hall <CH>  Courthouse <C>  Library <LI>  Hellfire Club <HFC>  Canadian Consulate <CC>
Rain falls like bricks down on the dark city. Thunder goes off like a gunshot. Lightning slams ripping forks that claw away the heavens, and the raging storm fists away Beacon Harbor sleeping breath. The world's cold, slimy, and gritty all at once. More thunder, but not from above. Sounded like a car's engine.

The stolen volvo literally flies. It spins with a horrible cry of tires on concrete, and it pulls off the city roads to disappear for the grassy knoll that sits in the very heart of the stormy town. 

Highbeams open up like eyeballs in the dark, two highways of light flaring with fierce intensity on Beacon Park. ""Try me, asshole!"" Detective Magdalen St. Matthew yells as she jerks on the wheel of her pick-up truck, and it flies over the curb, rips the gate off the park entrance, and roars in breakneck pursuit.

Her siren screams and her radio howls some screeching cover of Viva Las Vegas, in which she whistles calmly along as she chases tonight's car thief. The little bastard is stubborn, but back in Nevada, they called her the four-wheel pitbull. Give her a working car, and she could chase Satan himself down into the ninth ring of Hell. Her jaws do not let go.

She's been weathering this sucker since the Main Stretch, and as he swerves in and through darkened trees and invisible shrubs masked by night and a wall of rain, she follows. Cigarette in her mouth and hands on the wheel, she kicks the gas, misses an oak by inches, whirls a near-death one-eighty, and happily puffs away.



It was a shock. He's not sure which hit him harder -- the fact that his truck was packed and that he was leaving the BPRD, probably for the rest of his natural (or unnatural) life, or the fact that the yellow light swallowed him as he turned his back so he didn't have to see Liz or Abe's faces at his back. In fact, it was likely the leaving that struck him more. Light swallowed him, spat him out, or did otherwise strange things all the time where Hellboy came from, and he had gotten used to that. Still, he usually appeared in a possessed circus, a realm somewhat like Hell, or -- well, someplace with ground. Or that defied gravity. Here?

Gravity /worked/. And worked well.

He hits first, his duffel bag miraculously surviving the impact, though clothes go everywhere in the wet. He hits the Volvo like red, stunned meteor, making the car outright /flip/ over his body, landing on it's wheels even as Hellboy goes rolling over the earth and the wet, coming to a wet, muddy stop.

He's still; a red, coated lump. Shortly later, two heavy duty suitcases hit the ground. They survive admirably, and they don't even break open.



The Volvo is silent. The park is silent. The world is silent.

And then Magda has arrived.

Highbeams swallow Hellboy up. The monster of a truck comes roaring in like a motherfuck, its wheels tearing up sheets of grass and mud as it pursues like a predator. It comes charging at Hellboy out of the darkness, a large, black shape with two blinding eyes, and just when it seems it will strike -- it turns.

""SHIT!"" she screams as something huge and blurry and red spits down in her path. Her reflexes are good. Very good. She yanks on the wheel and misses the prostrate figure by sheer inches, but the wheels of her pick-up are waterlogged. The truck swerves sharply, spinning three sixties on the slick grass, smacking away a fire hydrant. Water fountains. The Ford SLAMS to a resounding stop, caught by a tree.



There are dim noises, pounding at Hellboy's temples. Last time he fell that far, he remembers, he landed on a camel. In Egypt. Bedouin's screamed, and ran. It wasn't so bad, though. He got up. He didn't get hit by speeding car in the rain.

He recovers rather quickly for his fall and impact. He's bleeding from the mouth, but it's washed away in the rain, and the red blends with his own skin well enough. But he rolls to his feet, feeling his knotted hair fall loose against the back of his neck. 

""What... the... hell... was that?"" He shifts; his duffel bag against his shoulder is near-empty, so he unslings it without a second thought. Just some clothes, anyway.

 But that -- a car, another car. One ... he hit, another...? 

He checks the Volvo first. Deader then doornails. ""Shit."" He's got to hope that the truck's got a live one, and marches over there, to peer in the window, his orange eyes almost dimlight alight...



Magda hurts. Her lean, lanky body sprawls in the cab of her truck, looped like a blanket over the steering wheel. She shifts slightly. The airbag deploys into her face. She nnghs muffledly.

Consciousness comes to her in the form of a touch, like fingers, not in some gentle, waking caress but in claws. Taloned through her skull rips a throbbing pain, and voicing a low, guttural groan, the woman in the truck opens one eye to her surroundings. Out of focus, blurred as if this were all a painting and some careless hand had swathed a smear over the colours, the world presents itself to the detective in the form of light, dim and unreliable, and the smoke from her dropped cigarette.

Slowly, carefully, achingly, one hand after the other clamping onto the dash to push herself up. She's bleeding from the temple, her dark curls sticking to it, the rest of her mercifully unharmed -- thanks to the seatbelt that she now unhooks. She hunches forward dizzily into the airbag, some cognizant part of her watching the pouring rain pearl and slide down the cracked glass of her windshield. It brings up memories that sicken her heart. She eases her head slowly to one side to avoid the sight, and that's when her eyes meet Hellboy's. She stares. She screams.



Yeah, he's got a live one all right -- live wire, even. ""Whoa, whoa, whoa! Lady, calm down. Not here to heard you. I'm a government agent, with the BPRD -- if that means anything at all you,"" he mumbles, shifting to find his badge -- he still carried it, even though he'd walked away from that part of his life. He didn't understand why; it was simply something he could not lay down and walk away from. Still, he finds it, fumbles with it, flips it open, in his left hand, and proffers it -- a gleaming golden badge, the sword and first of the BPRD, an a ... mundane government ID, Hellboy's mug within it's picture window. ""S'alright, ma'am. Are you okay?"" He glances at her, the car, the... park? What the hell was goin' on here...? ""You need medical attention. Lemme... call...""

He flips out his phone -- only to find it gets no service. What the hell? It gets service hundreds of feet underground! What gives? He frowns, pockets it, and then says, ""You got a phone, ma'am? I'll call 911.""



The woman falls back along the car seat, her chest breathing wildly and her eyes brighter than her highbeams. She is petite, defined in sharpness -- sharp cheekbones, jaws, nose, flaring grey eyes. Her curly hair frames her, sticking to where she's bloody and sweaty. She stares mindlessly at Hellboy, looking like she's not all there. Her face is pale, eyes unfocused, her face matted with disorientia and confusion. She shifts and her bike jacket yawns off of her shoulders. She's got her own badge, clipped to a shoulder holster. A cop. Or perhaps used to be, five minutes and one crash ago. Her hands grasp handfuls of her carseat, and prostrate for a moment, she blinks her eyes compulsively to clear them. One tics when it seems whatever she hell she's seeing isn't going away. ""/What?!?"" she answers breathlessly.



""Phone. Cellphone. Do you have one? Oh, hell -- stay put, lady, I'll find a payphone."" And just like that, the big lug turns around, pocketing his wallet, and heads off. There's got to be a payphone on the fringes of the park. There's got to be. They're all over. They -- right there. There's one. That's the ticket. He finds change in a pouch, is so satisfied by the click and ring, and begins to dial, even as he looks for street signs, a marker, something. Where /is/ he?

""This is 9-1-1. Please state the nature of your emergency.""

""Been a double car-wreck; got what looks like two dead men, young, and a pursuing police officer, still alive, probably concusssed and in shock. Keeps screamin' at me, so I'm not gonna get her outta her car. Wrapped itself 'round a tree...""

He can't name the park, but he gives locations. They trace the line. It's all pat and done, and Hellboy, once it's done, hangs up the phone, and then goes to collect his sodden clothing from the mud, rolling his shoulders and trying to shake the ache from them. Once he's got all his things, and both his suitcases collected, he walks back over to the truck, not getting in view of the poor woman inside. He speaks from a distance. ""Called 9-1-1, ma'am. You'll be taken care of in no time.""


After a moment of silence, the driver's door kicks open. It's dented, mashed frame creaks open and hits the tree. Long legs come into view, followed by a slow, tentative body, the woman supporting herself slowly to sit up. She still breathes hard, but at least she isn't screaming, the heel of her hand clamped to her temple as one grey eye squints against her pounding headache. Magda lets out a final breath, her bleary sight checking through the rain and the darkness. ""Where -- who are you?"" she calls out into the storm.


Shit, she's walking around! The suitcases drop, clasps still holding tight. ""Lady, lady, you shouldn't be walkin' around like that-- you were just in a major crash."" Says the red meteor from the sky who just crushed a volvo, and could probably dance ballet right now if he wasn't so -- well, poorly balanced for the art. ""You shouldn't move. Sit down. Please."" He move forward a little; always wary with these ones, in shock, confused. ""My name's Hellboy. I'm an agent-- was an agent of the BPRD. I'm not going to hurt you. In fact, I don't even know who you are or where I am. But since we're both speaking the same language, I think we're doin' pretty good so far.""

HE inches closer, his tail sweeping irritable arcs in the wet. He's soaked, but barely notices it. ""Are you a cop, ma'am? I saw your badge and holster."" He has an impressive piece himself -- sitting at his right hip, for left-hand draw.


Magda just stares at Hellboy for a heartbeat and a half, even after he's done speaking. Her eyes catclock as they follow his tail. Either it's taking her a little long to let the words soak into her bleeding head, or she's just never seen one of -- him before. Ever. Her lips work for a moment before her voice returns. ""Hellboy?"" she echoes, voice a little high. She puts a name to a face. A face that -- God, she's never ever going to forget. She stares a second time. Then she remembers. ""--I'm an officop. A cop. Officer. Yes."" She stares some more. She clears her throat, and reaches up to cradle her head, yet never straying too far from where she could possibly go for her gun. For now, however, she puts her mind on just trying to stand up. What just happened. She was driving. She crashed. Rain on the windshield. Crashed and stopped. She drove. She was chasing. She was -- aw, shit. ""--Shit shit shit,"" she hisses suddenly, her thoughts animating into the curses rolling off her scratchy throat. She stumbles, but doesn't seem to notice, her eyes leaving Hellboy finally to turn on the silent Volvo.



""Then you should know you're probably in shock, and need to /sit down/."" Sirens sound in the distance, and Hellboy couldn't be more thankful. He watches her amble about, as steady as a newborn fawn and likely twice as discombobulated. But he doesn't know what else to do other then sit next to his luggage and fold his arms across his chest. He's got explaining to do, most likely...

The sirens get closer. He waits. They finally pull up at the edge of the park, a wave of cops and paramedics making their way through the rain with an admirable speed. Thank god someone non-concussed has gotten here, Hellboy thinks. He doesn't know what he'd do if he was left along with Magda for much longer.



A wave that pretty much pauses mid-tide when they catch sight of Hellboy. Some of the paramedics are weathered, and know a meta when they see one, but still -- it takes an awfully jaded mind to see something like him without a doubletake. Leaning up resignedly against the wrecked side of her truck -- something she really hasn't noticed yet -- Magda lets the rain take her. Wash the blood away. She waves off paramedics as they try to tend to her, her eyes slipping back and forth between the dark Volvo and Hellboy. Watching him wordlessly.

The scene is now a tangle of bodies manning the storming muck. ""Um. Sir. Um, hi. Sir. Did you -- you made the call? Did you -- see? Everything?"" one young, fresh-faced paramedic gawps transparently as he approaches Hellboy, his young face rainy and all too intimidated. 

""Well, well, well,"" one quiet voice enters the din, the second officer on the scene. Detective Morro steps intrusively close to Magda but doesn't offer her his umbrella. He looks one step away from clucking his tongue, and even in darkness, the smile's there in his eyes. ""What did you get yourself into?""

She just looks at him. And then she looks away when one paramedic speaks up. ""Someone said there were two bodies. Who said that? Where are they? There's nothing in here.""

The Volvo's dangerously empty, one car door left open.



Hellboy endures the questioning quietly, his brows furrowed as he towers over the young paramedic. He doesn't need any help? See? He's just peachy. ""I ...feel from the sky. Hit the volvo. It flipped. Few moments later, I wa son my feet -- checked the car; driver and passenger seemed pretty dead -- couldn't find a pulse on either, anyway. But --"" He glances to the Volvo. Yeah. So much for that. 

""Shit. That was me. They looked pretty dead to me,"" he confesses. ""Though I was ... probably a little stunned. They probably ran when I made the call. Couldn't have gotten far in that condition, though -- one was laid open in the head, from here to here..."" he traces the line of the split on his own temple. ""I checked the officer there, tried to keep her from goin' all over...""

He pauses, and then asks, ""Where the hell am I?""



Morro sidles over the tiny little detective St. Matthew, watching her hoodedly as third paramedic applies a butterfly bandage to her gash, talking to her emphatically, asking her questions, checking her for shock as she looks less than amused. Finally when she's freed of all that foolishness, Morro leans in and mumbles something to her, his voice lost in the rain, his hand touching her shoulder and then tightening. She looks at him sharply and pulls away, staggering from the car. He smirks assily to himself, the expression freezing on his face when he finally takes note of Hellboy. His eyes narrow briefly, then turn, assessing the stormy park before he turns off, walking away, giving less than a rat's ass about this.

Magda teeters towards the Volvo, squinting, her own attention narrowed severely on the pursuit she remembers now. She watches as one paramedic leans into the dented car to check the backseats.

The young boy-paramedic talking to Hellboy starts to gush when he's asked the question. He knows the answer to that! ""Oh! You must be an immigrant? I'm sorry, I didn't realize. Hi! This place is called Beacon --""

There's a scream. The paramedic leaning into the car is pulled inside. The grey-eyed woman cop, despite her injuries, doesn't pause to fly in after him.

And as fast as a gunshot, a second body drops and lands on the hood of the Volvo. The monster is shaped like a man, and might have been one at one time. Now he is cursed with yellowed eyes, a mouth full of serrated teeth, and a bloodied, dented head laid open from one temple to the next. From here....to here.

The vampire snarls, its furious voice gurgling and face half-gored.



""Immigrant?"" Hellboy asks, looking at the paramedic like he's grown antenna -- not that it would really impressive Hellboy -- he demands, ""What do you /mean/, Immigrant. And B--""

And then all hell breaks loose. He's quick to whip his head around, eyes widening and mouth opening slightly as he sees the /thing/ -- vaguely recognizable as the driver -- and Hellboy is oddly comforted. Vampires. Okay, this he can deal with. 

""Yee haw, saddle up and ride 'em out,"" he mutters under his breath, pushing aside the paramedic with his right hand even as he draws with his left. ""Hey, fang-face! Right here! Got ya a present!"" The massive pistol cracks off a round; whizzing past the damn thing's head -- he hates shooting. He aims again, even as it begins to move, cracks off another shot. If he can hit the thing. Hoping it's the standard, run of the mill vampire, Hellboy figures it's dead if those bullets hit. Between the garlic and the holy water inside 'em... and the great big effin' hole they make, not much gets back up after he shoots it. Providing he can hit the broadside of a barn tonight.



The vampire's eyes turn on Hellboy. It seems to doubletake, possible thinking itself then the lesser of two evils, but its bloodied mug soon twists into another roar. It's an ugly sucker, its face a mess of warps and demonic ridges, those teeth serving only to rend and gore. It hisses, angry, stopping only when a bullet whizzes past it -- glancing back, and then returning eyes on Hellboy again. The vampire recoils, and then lunges. It clears a distance of twenty feet, supernaturally charged, and it doesn't even stop as the second bullet holes its shoulder. The arm disappears. Gravity barrels the vampire forward still, even though it's howling, hurting, its flesh charring and steaming from the holy water. It hits the ground, writhing there in horrible agony.

Morro looks back from the distance, hearing gunshots, hearing screams, hearing the roaring of something unnatural. It makes him smile. He keeps walking away.

Three shots ring out from inside the Volvo. A door kicks open, and the first body rolls out. It's the paramedic, somehow alive, an elderly man with a shuddering expression, terrified eyes, and a hand on his own neck smothering the blood that leaks there. He was bitten. From the other side of the Volvo, the second vampire tears itself free, blood gouting painfully from the three new holes in its body. Its yellow eyes look over. It sees its accomplice, fighting something that's -- red. And huge. And outnumbered.

""You piece of shit! Been chasing you since Main Street!"" Magda's voice suddenly barks, hers the third body to leave the car. Her eyes are wide and shocked to see the thing's real face, but anger folds her mouth in a sneer. The vampire looks back, sees her aimed gun, and decides to take off. She takes off after it, head wound and all, without wheels but still a pitbull in pursuit.



Advancing quickly enough, Hellboy cracks off two more rounds -- aiming better, now that it's down and wriggling, till he can get it's head to burst like a melon. ""Yeah, yeah, bitch, bitch, moan, moan. Just up and stay dead, okay?""

But he's not done yet. There are more -- a wounded man. ""Hey! Hey! Paramedic-- restrain him and get him down. ... May change, may not. Be careful!"" But that other one? It's moving. That damn idiot cop who just wrapped her truck around a tree? She's moving too. ""Aw, crap."" And now? Hellboy' running after, hooves clomping through mud and wet grass, catching against the earth and digging in as he propels himself forward, opening the Samaritan and tossing the brass. He digs in his pockets, finding the rounds -- but running and reloading doesn't work. At least he has them, though. He snaps the Samaritan closed again, holsters it, and pursues.



The boy-paramedic, the poor, paling kid who looks fresh out of medical school, he almost flies himself towards his wounded colleague, crouching down in the darkness and the wet next to the bleeding old man. That is the last sight to be scene of the clearing before the chase begins. 

 City Central Park is ravenous just at night. And with the storm, it is just mean. The blackness is thick like smoke, the columning trees and their millions of leaves walling in the humidity. The rain is so cold, but the air is almost too hot to be breathable. The atmosphere's dour and heavy, the ground serrated and uneven, roots looping up and sharp branches stretching like fingers to claw whatever they can. 

It's a vicious place, and it makes Magda's headache burn all the worse. She's lost the vampire now, one wrong upstart shadow removing the nocturnal monster from her eyes, and she turns circle after circle, gun in hand, trying to hone her ears over the slamming rain. She can feel her heart pounding in her teeth, and her head pulses with dizziness. Hearing harsh footsteps, the muscles steel in her body, fingers rearranging over her gun. She shoulders up to a tree trunk, exhales, and then knives through the darkness like a dart, body spinned and gun aimed on -- Hellboy? Her half-visible face is a picture of blood, bruising, and bemusement. Her aimed gun falls away. ""You?""



""Me! So me-- so please don't shoot. It'd only itch, anyway."" He takes this moment to stop, to breath, to catch his breath -- he's not winded, but he is tense. This is just a bit much right now, really. It's-- well, more then a bit much. Vanishing from the middle of the day in his home, appearing in the middle of fuckall knows where. He shifts his gun to that huge right hand of his, opening it up and rapidly loading in the four, oversized shells -- the gun would give a Desert Eagle performance issues. Still, he makes with it quickly. ""This is what I do, see -- where I'm from. Things that go bump -- I bump 'em back. Usually, till they stop moving."" 

He shifts the gun back to his left hand once it's loaded, and snaps it shut. ""You know what's going on?"" he asks. ""And what the hell did that guy call me an 'immigrant'?"" he asks, before he goes back to sneaking about, sniffing about -- ""Our boy couldn't have gone far. He'll bleed out, need prey. You put holes in him, or was that from the wreck?"" he asks, curiously.



There's really a million and one questions Magda could ask. Possibly even more. It's a real good thing that now just isn't the time. She's a woman of reason, but her most trusted feelings all come from her gut. And right now, her gut's telling her that she doesn't need to worry about the big red guy loading up a big bad gun. She turns again, letting her pale eyes scan the darkness around them. The park storms but is silent. By all uneducated guesses, they may very well be alone. She keeps her gun sure in one shivery hand, some part of her hoping she's cold from the rain and not shock. ""Two assholes stole a car. I've been after them halfway through the city. The dead just ain't arisen in this town, let me tell you. They rise and commit grand theft auto."" Bitter, she scans the treeline again, then exhales, pressing her hand to her brow again and then checking her palm for blood. She gives her head a shake, drenched ringlets pawed back from her face, which again turns on Hellboy. She studies him sharply. ""I'm no expert, but I'd say you rode the portals. Right in the middle of my chase. This is Beacon Harbor.""



""Road the /what/?"" Hellboy asks. ""Portals? I know lots about portals. But normally, they go to the Dreamtime, or a hell dimension, or Mir-Ti-Ku's diggin' supernatural pad. I've yet to have one drop me in the middle of a car chase."" He pauses, and considers, going closer to the treeline, as if he might flush prey. ""Weirder things have happened, though."" He noses about, finds nothing. He snorts. ""Where about did you loose Mr. Leaky?"" he asks, glancing forward, and then to both sides. ""Cause he's likely to book for the nearest sack of bloodbags -- IE, people -- to get a snack and regenerate.""

If he's the type, he thinks to himself. Or maybe he'll try his luck here. Cop's already wounded, blood fresh on her. Mmm, yummy snack. Hellboy backs away from Magda, further, further -- he hates using a stranger as bait, but no one's likely to jump her if she's got him as her sewn-on shadow. ""C'mon, you sunuvabtich...""



""This city's got a portal problem. It brings people in and doesn't let them go back,"" Magda tells Hellboy, angling another glance back at him. She shrugs a little at the logistics of it all. No expert here. Now, when he asks about the vampire, she's a lot more knowledgeable. ""Lost 'em right here -- and no, he's not gonna snack nothin'. Not while I'm here.""

She sourly rubs blood away from her hand onto her soaked shirt, both hands regathering her gun. She either doesn't notice or doesn't mind Hellboy's sudden distance from her, taking the cue to split up to cover more ground. She moves in the opposite direction, thinking herself the real predator here, one that's not going home empty-handed. She creeps in towards a thicket, and just when her body is half-swallowed by the encroaching shadows, something deliberately strikes.

The monster is back. It's bleeding something awful, losing its last meal with each moment, and the hunger is unreal. It smells blood, rich and gloriously fresh, so close, too close that it cannot be ignored. The vampire claws at her, and the gun's the first thing to go, clattering away into the night. It seethes. It's seen many things in its day, in this city, demonic things and celestial happenings, beings as unexplainable as its own immortality and thirst for blood.

It's seen it all, but even so, this is the first time it's been attacked by its own meal. The vampire didn't expect to get a fist to its unworking kidneys just there. Magda is mad.

""Ugly!"" She twists her heel into its knee. ""Piece!"" She recoils to put her fist in all those ridges. ""Of!"" --Shit. She's good, but it's supernatural, and the vampire trumps her with a good backhand, needing to claim its bleeding bait. It doesn't care about the fists. It just works to get in close, its jaundiced eyes only for her throat.


Hellboy stays a set distance away -- pacing, pacing, sick to his stomach that he's dropped this low. But he doesn't know what else to do -- he's disoriented as it is, and she's perfect for things. Still, he's not going to let her get hurt on his watch -- at least, not anymore hurt then she already is. 

But even as she vanishes into the thicket, he curses this plan, avoiding all pretense of shadowing and outright pursues. He stomps over branches and roots, crushing them beneath his heavy footfalls -- he weight nearly a quarter done, and these things do not stand up to his steamroller way of going over them. Even as it's on top of her, he's atop them, and he abandons the gun -- back to it's holster -- for a more hand's on approach.

""Didn't your mama--"" he says, even as he latches hands on it, gripping at clothing and the back of the thing's neck, ""teach you how to treat,"" hefting it up, he takes it in hand like a battering ram, ""a lady, asshole?""

Vampire, meet tree. Face first. Repeatedly. Until either the thing's head or the tree gives.



Stygian fangs stop just an inch from her jugular. Peeled off of the woman like a shrieking, starving bandaid, the vampire is wheeled around in time to shake faces with the side of an oak. It roars. And again. Shrieks. And again. The monster's durable, and it seems a forever of struggling and fighting as it's slammed sickly into shredding bark. Again and again and again. With one last crunch, its face looking like fresh hamburger, the unconscious demon falls silent. And then a powerful SMASH puts its head right into the cracking bark. When it's reefed back, just the body comes free. It crumbles into dust. Magda just watches it all, still from her half-fallen, half-slouched place, her body breathing harshly from adrenaline and exertion. Her grey eyes tic, and the rain rolls down her face."

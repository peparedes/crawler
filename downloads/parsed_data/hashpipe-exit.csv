I'm sorry! I'm wiping the happy tears. Hahahahahahahaha. <br /><br />I had the best fuckin' night of my goddamn fuckin' life! I was mourning like a fuckin girl last night until my friend's from Los Angeles called me at 10pm and told me they heard about my pathetic loss and they wanted to meet up and fuck up my night more. WOULD I SAY NO?! <br /><b>What I accomplished last night: </b><br /><br /><ol><br />    <li>First we stopped by my parent's place because my friends wanted to say hello. <br /></li><br />    <li>Second, we crashed Pierre's hotel and ordered a whole shit load of food and drinks. <br /></li><br />    <li>We wanted to drink. Marc, Jesse, Sarah, and I went to buy some. When we got back, my friends were playing twister. <br /></li><br />    <li>Gis brought his Wii. I kicked his ass in poker! There's POKER on Wii! Fuckin WEIRD but Fuckin AWESOME. <br /></li><br />    <li>Model Dudes and Gals came over to join but there was no more space in the hotel to hold all of us so we moved to Skitz' Apartment and damn man. Everyone went crazy. <br /></li><br />    <li>We played HS games like suck and pass, spin the bottle, and when we we were all fuckin tipsy, we played who stole the cookie from the cookie jar! <br /></li><br /></ol><br />Forget the numbering. It's fuckin up my story! Skitz' got this awesome kid named Rich. He's only 3 years old but he's a bad ass little fucker. He didn't want to go to bed because he wanted to help his dad mix our drinks. He eventually fell asleep on the couch when we were all so tired and wasted. <br /><br />This group of friends from L.A...I grew up with them. They were all from Canada first but they were all born in L.A. I was the outkast. Hahaha. We used to skate together. the fun days dude. Our parents were good friends so we had no choice but to grow up together. <br /><br />I didn't have the much sleep because my cousins from mom's side woke me up. They wanted to hang out before they head back to school. Now, I'm up and eating chocolate for breakfast. The other night my cousin came over and we had a wild sleepover. I taught my crazy fuck 15 year old cousin how to roll up a joint. hahaha. We wanted to have solo weird shots all over the house. Fuckers did a good job. <br /><br />This is for me. Everything's Cool by lit."

I wish life was easier. I don't blame life though. Life's okay as it is. There are just things that are too much for some to handle. I'm not complaining. I'm just... fucked right now (this is Nike talking).

But I know this heart of mine was made to fight every painful stare.""

I have been working so hard ... My body is kiling me already. I NEED SLEEP. SLEEP. SLEEP. Please send me to bed already. I know my body is getting tired and soon, i'm going to get sick. That's okay. I'm a fuckin' healthy man. lol. What's it going to be?

<P>Haven't been updating much huh? Haven't been writing much either.&nbsp;<BR>What's been up? <BR>Let's see... I think my friends pissed because I finished most of her credit. Even if she says ""im not mad. It's okay. I'll just get money from my dad."" Shit. I'm really sorry! I'll get some money! Somehow. I know your mad! </P>
<P>I will not be sad. I will not be sad. <BR>I dont like it when people are pissed at me. It doesnt feel right. I wonder if there are people who are pissed at me. I hope not. I really don't like that feeling of being hated. If one person hates you, then there's surely another one! It's like a chain. Seriously! Especially if that person who hates you has a lot of friends! And those friends trust her! LIKE CARMS! Ahhhhh!!! I'm really sorry carms. I promise to find a way on how to pay you back. I'll never do that again. I will always inform you before i exceed time limit. hehe..... im sorry. </P>
<P>alright, i wont think about it for now. as soon i finish this entry I am going to call carms up and apologoze personally. </P>
<P>I was thinking about something and realized that <STRONG>Life isn't that bad</STRONG>. <BR>Everyone says life sucks but what do they think? Life is supposed to be the Garden of Eden? What kind of world would we have if it was perfect. No war, no pollution, no crime, all peace, no love. Don't they ever think that all these ""sucky"" shit that happens to us are all wake up calls (maybe)? Or they have purposes? A lot of people blame God but don't they think that maybe God is doing all this to open our eyes or punish us? We were the ones that do all the bad things not GOD. So why blame him? It's irrational you know. Man is all about ""me,me,me"" and men think they're not like that but they are! If people really cared then they would care to stand up and make a change. We all here that ""somethin small could make a big difference in the world"" but how many actually follow that? If we picture the world.... one person could pick up a can of soda that's on the street and throw it (that makes a difference) but if you zoom out to ALL THE STREETS IN THE WORLD, people jus pass by. What difference did the person who threw the can make? Nothing. In the world we live in now, it's not ""the small things could make a difference anymore."" My point is... Life doesnt suck because sll these negative experiences are just lessons. It makes us open our eyes. Man is too sel-centered to actually see that. <BR>Even im like that. self-centered, doesnt think. blah blah. </P>
<P>SO! HI! It's 10pm and i'm awake. I just got home from rehearsals. Show is on July 3 and 4. Right after that i think im off to Boston. They will not stop me from going to Berklee this summer! If they do, they will never hear the end of me. hehehe. I bought 3 shirts in the net. One quicksilver. One volcom. One polo from guess. I used my card.... not dads. But he's gonna find out anyway when he checks. Can you believe my dad checks?! He's&nbsp;so pathetic.... I dont know why he needs to check. It's not like I'm gonna spend ALL my money... hmm.. I should try that. HAHAHA! Anyways, im going to sleep early tonight. So, i can wake up early tomorrow. I think JP, Bailey, Ray and I are going to have breakfast in Mcdonalds tomorrow morning. We had to BEG our parents to allow us. They finally did. It's just breakfast!!!! We have never eaten mcdonald's breakfast. Can you believe that? How sad is that? real sad. </P>
<P>I'm going to go now. My eyes are beginning to close and my ipod is waiting for me. <BR>MY GOAL IS ALMOST COMPLETE!!!! <BR>8,000 songs in my ipod. By the end of this month. I will finish ALL The space. Oh yah, that ""goal"" started one month ago. I was invited to go to a party. should i go? Maybe.</P>"

<P>I think ill go swimming in the lake today!!! I'll ask my cousins if they wanna hang out. I dont know what Bailey does in his place.... whenever im there the ONLY thing we do is play xbox or playstation. When we were kids we used to do a lot of things! Like play with out hotwheels! MAN! i miss doing that!!! We would connect all the ""coasters"" and make a really big and cool one! hahaha! Then we would play all these make up war games in his room. We were small so it was easy for us to run around. There were times when Nic would come over and we would be the three amigos! hahaha! I really miss those days... I miss being a kid!!! I miss playing with toys. I could play with toys now but it's different. It's feels different. It's like my imagination has gone away. Well, not when i play war. Cos my cousins and i ROCK when we play war games hahaha! PAINTBALL!!! i think ill do that next week. </P>
<P>I just came back from our Cruise. It was fun cos i.... i have no idea. hahaha! Had fun with my fam i guess. Things happened and i give it a thumbs up! Phill has a girlfriend&nbsp;and im really happy for him. Japs misses his girlfriend (SHUT UP ALREADY!!! Hahaha!). hahaha! </P>

"event","<P>Not in the ship yet. Still hanging out here in my dad's friend's apartment. Pretty cool place if you ask me. hehehe. </P>
<P>I was talking about my passion for music in my other entry and i forgot to mention about how lyrics also affect me. Yeah... MAN! i love cool lyrics. What's ""cool lyrics""? Lyrics that sound rad and really make you wanna ROCK. I'm not into sentimental music.. so that's not my idea of cool lyrics. <BR>My Ideal ""cool lyrics"" : <BR><STRONG><FONT size=5><EM>Can't take it anymore, shake until we move the floor</EM></FONT></STRONG>, what are we waiting for? Let's go! I'm<BR>tired of being ordinary, <STRONG><FONT size=4><U>don't care if there's people staring</U></FONT>, I'll rely on your strength to<BR>carry me on.</STRONG> I'm not invisible like you, next time things get a little messed up, I'll shine,<BR>but I'll never be see through.<STRONG> I'm fine just tryin to wake the rest up.</STRONG>&nbsp; - TFK </P>
<P>[Don't you just want to ROCK when you hear that?! ROCK WITH ME, BABY!!! hehehehe! That's one of my ""power"" songs. When I play that song... wait... THOSE LYRICS SAY WHAT I FEEL!!! (that's why i emphasized some of the lines. hahaha!) When i get restless and i just wanna play some music/ rock on my guitar.... &gt;&gt;<EM>Can't take it anymore, shake until we move the floor!!!</EM> Yeeeaaaah! I think i'm restless now. Too bad i can't play. One, i dont have my guitar. Two, I can't... my leg. hehe! Soon... *nods head* soon...] </P>
<P>I've been restless about that for the past days... I really want to play. Air guitar stopped working. i think i abused it. hahaha! I'm copying the way JP emphasizes lines from songs. hahaha! It looks cool. My brothers are playing chess in the garden. It looks like those picture perfect moments. You can take ""artistic shots"". I think that's one thing our family kinda sucks at... photography. Wait, except Phill. I think he took a class before but i don't think he pratices. For me... A picture is a picture. Click and be happy with what comes out. I don't know how to cook. For me... cooking is boring. My dad's friend is a chef and he talked about the art of cooking.. it didnt interest me at all. I guess cooking isn't my thing. </P>
<P>What have I been up to? Nothing really. JP and I bonded a little and we played songs. hahaha! He and i were playiing mmmbop (yes, the one by hanson) but the acoustic version. It sounded cool believe it or not! Xab was listening to it while we were in the Philippines and I found it cool. I learned it.. so did JP. hahaha! He was singing it when he was ""depresssed."" Yah, whatever, they're back together. hahaha! (not talking about that... hehehe! Some things are meant to be kept.) <BR><FONT size=2>""Can you tell me? NO you can't, cos you dont know<BR>Can you tell me? you say you can but you dont know!""</FONT>&nbsp; ---hahahaha!<BR>(i got the ""making the font smaller"" from alex and dans) I WANNA SING MY HEART OUT!!!! I DO!!! I REALLY DO MAN!!! I'll do that in the ship with my brothers. hahaha! We planned everything already. We're going to preform Wicked and Hairspray (maybe the assasins) in our room. hahaha! Yeah, call us pathetic but it's fun. Anyways, I'm here in the living room.... listening to my dad and his friend talk about shit i don't even understand. Mom and my aunts are in the room, i think they're sleeping or drinking tea. hahaha! Tea. Bailey, Hugs&nbsp;and Eliza are in the other room. Last time i was in the room, they were playing NBA 2005. My two other brothers and Lara are playing chess. I've been stuck with Bailey since... i dont even know! He's really my brother. A lot of people think we're brothers cos we look a like. Yeah,&nbsp;we agree... we do look alike. hahaha! Maybe because.. OUR DAD'S&nbsp;ARE BROTHERS!! hahaha! His dad isn't here though. If the whole clan went to the cruise.. then we would have to rent the WHOLE ship. </P>
<P>Next thing I want to say is <STRONG><U>I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND</U></STRONG>. hehehe. She is the most amazing girl in my life. <BR>She thinks we have nothing in common. yeah.. we do... we both agree we were made for each other! hehehe! I love her. Yeah yeah, cheezy but who gives a shit! WANT ME TO SAY HER NAME?! I'm proud of being with her!!! <BR>Her name's DANIE!!!! YEAH!! SHE'S MINE!!! <BR><STRONG><FONT size=7>MINE.</FONT></STRONG> <BR>ALL MINE. <BR>Any guy tries to touch her... *mad face* <BR>""Yes, now you've captured me. I surrender happily. Oh Dans, Never set me free!!"" </P>
<P>I think i have to go soon. I'll rest. It's a waste if i stay in the room for the whole trip. hahaha! I want to enjoy the ship. Tour around the place. I'll be a bad boy and i'll go to the engine place. hahaha! I want to take dans to a cruise. Just her and i. We'll have fun! A room all to ourselves. hehehe. *wink* hahaha! Right Jules. </P>
<P>I think I belong on stage. I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world that I love to sing and dance on stage. To understand better.. I LOVE BEING IN MUSICALS. I enjoy performing for people. Those spotlights, the ensembles, the stage, the props, the music, everything... makes me feel so good. My heart pounds but not because of fear... because of excitement. Man.. i miss it SOOO much. that's why im trying to convince dad to allow me to do hairspray in Toronto. *sad* <BR>YOU CAN'T STOP THE BEAT!!! yes.. you can't. so you can't stop the beat that makes my life go on. <BR>When I hear those drums... I take a step. <BR>When I hear those guitars... I take another. <BR>No one else... just me and the music. <BR>I'm myself, i know myself, I see myself <BR>You can't stop the rhythm in my heart, You can't me from moving my feet. <BR>The Passion that burns within me whenever i hear that melody. <BR>The melody that makes my heart pump <BR>The melody that makes me. <BR>The person who I am. <BR>......hehehe. I guess people now know what music really does to me. How my passion is really music. </P>
<P>my other passion.. the beach. <BR>Damn.. <BR>OKAY I WONT START! hehehe! This entry is becoming really long but that's okay. I haven't written a long entry in such a long time. hahaha! </P>

<P>I'm bored... nobody is online.<BR>My friends and I hung out last night and the girls started talking about bathroom stuff. WHAT'S WRONG WITH GUYS USING FACIAL WASH?! I learned in chemistry that it's bad to use normal soap for the face because it's acidic to the face. I'm not sure if it's acidic or base but it's one of those! So, normal hand soap is BAD for the face. It would be WEIRD if we used those other stuff you girls use.. i dont even know what they're called. When i travel and i have to bring tioletries, i dont BRING the whole bathroom! When i see my cousins stuff, MAN!! GIRLS PACK TO MUCH!!! It's so hectic to pack so much... I like girls who dont pack the whole house. My mom packs the whole house sometimes. When we went to Mexico, mom brought the whole house. YOU CAN BUY TOILET PAPER IN MEXICO. man.... women. hahaha! </P>
<P>Well, that's what i really want to talk about... hahaha! I'm leaving for the Philippines friday night. I don't know if i want to go or not. I don't know if i'm excited or not. I'm excited for the party but at the same time.. i feel bad. </P>
<P>time to go. </P>"

WE DID NOT CONTRIBUTE IN MAKING THAT TITLE!</EM> hahahaha! <BR>This play has two stories in it and if you're smart enough you'll get it.<BR>= = = The first story is about a boy who is striving to get this girl that he's ""attracted to."" Althrough out the play he does all these crazy shit just to get the girl (he sings for her in a bar, he dances in front of the whole school for her, he gives her roses and chocolates, he stripdances for her, he climbs a moutain for her) then he finds out that she's gonna leave. So, he's all sad... then when she leaves he finds out that she's a lesbo. He says, ""Oh. Oh well!"" <BR>= = = The second story is about a girl who nobody likes cos she's a nerd. then she tries to make this boy like her but nothing... she even fails a test just for him to notice her but nothing. <BR>= = = in the end that girl and that ""desperate"" boy (played by Jules) end up together. </P>
<P>TYPICAL LOVE STORY! we all know that.. BUT what makes the whole thing worth watching are the songs we dance and sing to! hahahaha! <BR><U>let me give you some of the songs that we're singing: <BR></U>1. mmmbop -hanson <BR>2. as long as you love me - backstreet boys <BR>3. get down - backstreet boys <BR>4. ill be there for you - moffats <BR>5. love sensation - 911 <BR>6. im gonna miss you forever - aaron carter <BR>7. little itty bitty one - aaron carter <BR>8. crazy little party girl - aaron carter <BR>9. crush on you - aaron carter <BR>A LOT MORE! spice girls, a teens, steps, etc. hahahahaha!

<P>Love.... you can't explain what your feeling but you're feeling it. No matter what you say it's never perfect. It's not how you want it to come out.

I THINK i understand it but the things is, i'm not sure if what im feeling to correct. {right...}<BR>The feeling of falling over only comes when the person has proven that he/she loves you back. You can't say that you're falling for someone if that person you ""love"" never showed it to you. Fine, the person is nice, sweet, humble, all those things... that makes you love them right? but..... isn't it....&nbsp;love is&nbsp;supposed to be mutual? <BR>use the word: <STRONG><U><FONT size=4>CRUSH.</FONT></U></STRONG> <BR>okay, why am i talking about this? i dunno, i was thinking about it awhile ago while i was listening to love songs over the radio.

HOW CAN YOU LOVE SOMEONE AT FIRST SIGHT?! you don't even know the person! i'm really against people who say that.&nbsp;I don't believe at love at first sight. that's not love.. .. that's............

<P>what in me do people not understand??? <BR>I'm so hard to be with? I found the girl i know I love. I had feelings for her. I saw my world in her eyes. She dumps me... cos i like staying inside a can. She can't find a stupid can opener. I'm so fuckin sad now. My brothers and I aren't going to school later. we hae to rest. We're tired. The 3 of us ended up sleeping the whole lunch period and we were falling asleep in some classses. Phill got called to stay in front of the class because he was falling asleep in math. </P>
<P>We have some family thing this weekend in Virginia. My mom's friend's invited us to go to their house and stay there for the weekend while dad goes to Vancouver for some business crap that i heard him talking about on the phone with Uncle Rich. </P>
<P>Then next weekend I'm gonna be home alone because my brothers have some camp/ field trip in Montreal the whle weekend. They'll be back Sunday. They'll be gone friday-sunday night. Mom told me to invite Tom over.... I guess I should huh? We're trying to cheer him up but nothing... I pray for him everynight. Also for Uncle Chase and Aunt Marie. They need prayers....&nbsp;</P>
<P>Next next weekend,&nbsp;My brothers, friends and I&nbsp;are going to the beach.&nbsp;We're dragging Tom..&nbsp;He needs a break. WE ALL NEED A BREAK.&nbsp;Sam&nbsp;is coming... well,she's supposed to go...&nbsp;Some of Phill and&nbsp;JP's friends. I think they're gonna go drinking again. That's fine with me.&nbsp;tome to have fun right? </P>
<P>We're going the Philippines for Xmas&nbsp;Reunion. Holy Crap. the&nbsp;WHOLE family will be there.&nbsp;OW YES!!!&nbsp;<BR>I think we're having it in <STRONG>Subic or Palawan</STRONG>.

""Jules, We have to talk the minute you get back."" She didn't sound happy. Shit, well, ill be seeing her later. I hope she'll be alone. I don't know how I'll be able to talk to her with her friends around. Some of her friends are very intimidating. <BR>I wonder why she wants to talk to me... <BR>if she breaks up with me...

"event","Finally checked my voice mail today, and there were several from poor Sven.  It seems I left Rage at my condo.  -_-;  Funny, how a month full of passion will make you forget the little things...AH, I mean, make you into a selfish b**ch who forgets her friends! Gotta lower the dose on my Valum!

Just a few more days until I'm back in Japan.  Who knew that a simple few hour flight could be extended to a week long cruise? Here I am lounging, typing away, and who do you think is beside me?  That's right, Ark.  But, he will never get a tan in that suit, I don't care if its linen!"

"event","I know, I know, for someone who loves the Lime Light I have been painfully invisible.  I guess I could say my absence has been a blissfull one.  When Ark came and dropped off Michael he had eveidently made a deal with K to take me away from it all. He was worried about my stress concerning the movie and K's new relationship with some co-worker.  The thing is, I've met Sakano, and I think of him as a sweet and charming yet completely inept in a rural kind of way.  The thought of him and my husband together is, well, concerning, but not threatening.

So, my Darling Fluffy loaded up my bag and wisked me away on an airplane to Hong Kong.  He treated me to a suite in the Grand Maple Leaf Hotel, their Emperess room.   After tipping the bellhop, Ark through the suit case across the room <lj-cut text=""I soon found myself on the bed...""> I found myself surrounded by crimsom silk sheet with Ark's famillar weight resting on top of me. I coyily pulled his Armani tie out from his suit vest and pulled him down for a kiss. I hear him growl deep in his throat. I love pulling him around by his tie, especially when that is all he is wearing. I sigh towards the bed's high canopy and arch my back so I can press myself further into his hard form.
""How could you leave me like that?"" Ark whispered as he nibbled on my neck.  ""I thought all visits with K were suspose to be the three of us?""
Just the thought of the three of us made my pulse race faster.  I flashed back to old times, before I got pregnate with Michael and it was the three of us in bed every night doing any number of things to each other.  Ark would dominate my pussy while K filled me from behind, the two of them holding each other so close with me wedged between, I could feel their hearts beating through my own chest.
""Judy...""
The blush on my face must have told him my thoughts.  I love Michael, he's my darling son, but his birth destroyed our little menage e trois. His blonde hair marked Crawd as his father, something that tore something up inside of Ark...
""Forget about him,"" my darling said,""Tonight is about us.""

Ark flipped me over long enough to unzip my dress.  Before I had much chance to breath, we were naked, even the tie was in the mass of clothes on the floor.  I reached down and rubbed the head of Ark's erection against my flowered lips and eased him inside.  My walls clenched and caressed him like I did with my hands.  his chest had a little tuft of hair I like to run my fingers through as the other hand plays with his nipples.
It had been weeks since we had been together, and there was an air of despiration in our movements.  Ark's pace quickly went from gentle thrusts to a jack hammering rhythem that had me grasping the bed to met his thrusts. The famillar tingle raced up my spine and i came, milking Ark for all he was worth.  Content, we collasped in a pile, kissing one another in the soft places we knew each liked best.
</lj-cut>

..so the month passed in bliss, and what strange things I find on my return...."

"event","My life is just poopy!  Ah, too much time with my seven year old.  Ark is not leaving my side.  He dropped off Michael with his dad the other day and has resumed his job as my faithful lap dog fluffy.  Ark just stood there as Crawd chewed me out for leaving my son behind.  How dare I want some one on one time with him?  I have to say that the whole ordeal left me quiet depressed.  I went shopping to erase the idea that in some ways, Crawd only accepts me when Ark is along for the ride.  With Ark, there is an us, and an us with Crawd, but with Crawd, I think that had dissapated into a relationship more along the lines of, this is the mother of my child.  

I wonder how it would have been if Ark was..... never mind.  I don't even want to say it to myself, much less leave it for you all to see.

I got the most desressing note devilvered to my hotel room today.  It was written on one ply toliet paper and folded into a throwing star.  I don't know what it was written with, but its sticky. >.<

Rage is in jail???? I sent her here to work with Crawd, but I had lost track of her.  She writes that she is in solitary confinment but is getting ""benefits"" from the warden.  I don't think she's talking 401K!

Luckily, I know Rage, and am perpared for such circumstances.  I am sending her a special little panda friend with and explosive personality.  When Ark gets out of the shower, I'll have him take it down to the lobby to go out with the morning mail.  With any luck, Rage will be top side in two days, depending on the Japanese mail system..

Oh, the shower's just stopped.  Better go dry Ark's back,... and front!"

"event","Well, after a few moments in the doorway sharing insults with that SCHELMEIL, i knew a few things.
1) I was dealing with someone too self absorbed to help me, let alone anyone else.
2) If Crawd was with him, he must have suffered massive brain trama, which I would have      known about.  I'm still his emergency contact on health forms afterall.
3) I would kill for his fuzzy bunny slippers. 

So, after making him cry about his rubber duckie (who would have known he actually had one!  Geez) I turned about in a whirl of faux fur and clicked my way down the stairs.  I was 5 steps from being out the door when my cell phone started ringing.  Thank god for Verizon!!!
And, much to my dismay its Ark. ....  and I thought I had picked up some bad words"

"event","I woke up late, after I slept through the wake up call from the front desk.  I felt better after that though.  It was afternoon and it actually felt like afternoon to me.  Before I left NY, I had just finished production on a movie where I played an aging actress who wanted one last claim to fame.  Imagine, ME, playing an aging actress.  Oh, the time I had to spend in the make up chair.  

So, after a little brunch, I put on my best dress and went husband hunting.  

Oh, Crawd darling, where are you?

I should have called I suspose, but I soooo love to make an entrance.  So, I go over to his apartment unannouced, and this kid answered the door.  He had to be under age. Black hair, smaller in stature.  Looks kinda like that blonde guy Ryuichi-kun carried a picture of when he was with us in NY. My Japanese is terrible, and I didn't bring Fluffy, my manager and loveslave, with me this time.  I was so hoping for a nice romatic visit with my husband, without our favorite third wheel for a day.  But Ark/ Fluffy is the most fluent, after Crawd himself of course.  
Any way, the kid.
So, I tried to introduce myself.
""Konichiwa, Atatshi wa Judy Winchester des~u!""
Ah..""Where is my husband?"""

"event","It was rather last minute in planning.  But I really wanted to come here and see Crawd as soon as I could.  Ark had everything planned out in minute detail, which is soooo him.... My darling Fluffy would be lost without his scheduler.  And Michael.  I told him I had to get daddy ready for his visit.  That he wouldn't have enough toys.  I know he saw right through that, but what can I say.  My seven year old is smarter than me.

Needless to say, I expect Ark to be here tommorow with an nice big gun pointed at my head.  He was never one for foreplay!  I am going to see our lover without him.  Its completely unfair, but i have had a rough week.  The movie just wrapped up, and I am spent.  The plane left without Ark on the wing, so I think I'm lucky.

So, after the nice taxi driver loaded my things, I headed off to my favorite hotel, the Maple Hotel.  It's my favorite place to stay and entertain while I am in New York.  It's ever so nice to have one here as well.  Unfortuantly, the owner just happen to be in town and a fan! Kaeda Doumyouji accosted me when i was bearly two feet into my suite!  

While she is a good business woman, I find her to be cold.  Her assistant let it slip that she was in Japan on family matters.  I hear she has a son, but I don't really know much about him. On our other meetings, he has hardly ever come up, though I gush over Micheal all the time!


Ah, this has become so long.  Kaeda finally left when i started to snore in the soup.  The king side bed looks inviting...calling me ""Judy...judy!""

Oyasami!"

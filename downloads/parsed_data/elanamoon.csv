*stretches*

what a surprise, we moved again. this time, we're living in a house in hatfield with robert and stacey and sometimes laura. we moved in just before new years day, and it's been pretty great. i'd even go so far as to say it's the best living situation that james and i have ever been in. the four (sometimes five) of us live in fantastic harmony. it's like a family where you actually get to pick your relatives! now, i know that we move a lot more than most people, but i really hope this lasts, because i just love my housemates. and our cats. and the fact that our house is basically the hub and meeting-place of our entire group of friends. and having awesome jam sessions in the basement. 

life is good.

i'm still working at wawa. it's a job, not much to say about it. i make sandwiches for people. some customers are great, some absolutely suck, most of them are completely forgettable. james is still working at adult world.

the 'L' key on my keyboard has decided that it will only work when it damn well pleases. i, however, am persistent and i flatly refuse to allow misspelled words in my entries. i don't care whatsoever about capitalization and grammar, but damn it, my spelling will always be impeccable."

"event","what's up, i'm here!

okay, i'm going to try and get out a quick entry while i'm on a friend's comp...

so here's what has happened since i came back to PA:

we moved in with our friend melissa in chalfont, and lived in the middle of nowhere in ""shared space"" bliss for about half a year.

while living there, i got a job at wawa (a local convenience store chain, for you non-PA folks). james got a job at adult world (a sex shop).

we bought my cousin's car, a robin's egg blue 1995 dodge neon that has been being passed around in my family since it was new.

after a little while, we decided that since we're married, we should have our own place, so we found a cute little apartment in the middle of lansdale. hooray, civilization again! actually, it was the same apartment we were in a few years before. (remember the fire on christmas eve '07?) it was easy to get because we were already in good favor with the landlord. when you're poor, you can't exactly afford to be choosy, people. the place was fixed up all nice-like, with new carpets and ceiling tiles and state-of-the-art fire alarm system. we moved in there on may 1st, and haven't had the internet since, because we can't afford it. the rent here is twice the rent we were paying in chalfont.

a week ago, we were rear-ended by an unobservant soccer mom driving an SUV. we were okay, we just had some whiplash and were prescribed some fun painkillers and muscle relaxers. luckily, the other driver's insurance covers our loss of income, since we were out of work for a few days. but our poor baby is totaled, despite still being drivable. and so ends the life of our beloved piece of shit family heirloom car.

also, james and i just celebrated our first wedding anniversary, and we ate wedding cake that had been sitting in the freezer for a year. YUM! actually, it was better than i had expected. it still tasted like chocolate!

AAAANYWAY, that's pretty much all that's happened in the past 6 months, all that's worth mentioning, anyway. i'm going to attempt to keep this up by using the internet at friend's houses and stuff.

so, how have all of YOU been? i mean, the two or three people who just might actually be reading this?"

"event","i seriously can't wait until we go back home. i truly love san diego, but that's nothing compared to my love for all my people back in PA. we're moving in with our friend melissa, who so graciously offered us her spare room. she's one of the coolest people i know, and i'm really looking forward to having her as a roommate. hopefully the new living arrangements will turn out to be as great as i think they will be. hell, anything's better than having a 74-year-old for a roomie! 

was that too harsh? i don't care anymore. grandjean's really getting on my nerves. she's been trying to make us feel guilty for leaving, even though she KNOWS we've lost 2,000 dollars by being here. correct me if i'm wrong, but our responsibility as caregivers does not include being bled dry by some old lady, am i right? as newlyweds, we should be living our lives based on opportunity, not obligation. so, back east we go! i'm looking forward to working hard and building our savings back up. i'm almost glad that james' rich-as-hell dad has never taken any financial responsibility for his one and only son. i just wouldn't feel right having money that i didn't earn with my own hands. and james has a similar ourlook, having grown up scratching in the dirt like me.

we're wealthy where it counts. there are so many people back home that are excited to see us. we have the most wonderful family, and the greatest friends in the world! i wouldn't trade them for anything. i can't wait to see them all again.

but there is one thing that i'll REALLY miss. it's november, and it's going up to 88F today. bye, wonderful warm weather, i barely knew ye... *cries* :P"

"event","we're gradually having less to do with grandjean's care, in order to get her used to caring for herself. it doesn't look very promising, and she'll probably have to go into a nursing home shortly after we leave. it's sad, but i almost wish that would happen before we left just so we could make sure she's ok. i hate to think of her falling and breaking a hip or something, with no one around to help. if that happens, she might be on the floor for days until someone else realized what happened. and i wish we could take her cat with us, instead of having him be adopted out to a stranger. but i know she won't let us take him, because she insists that she can take care of herself. but, it's out of our hands now.

also, it really sucks that i have to leave my job at sears. i really liked working there. oh well!"

"event","things here haven't been working out. we've been losing money like crazy every week because this place is so expensive to live in. so, we're coming back to pennsylvania. a friend of ours has offered her spare room to us, so the living arrangement is taken care of. i don't think we failed, because we tried our very best in this situation. we gave it everything we had, literally.

we've lost about two thousand dollars living here. that's about two thirds of our life savings. it's going to take us forever to save that much again. it may not seem like a lot to some people, but to us it was huge. and there's no way to get it back, either. james' dad is the one who sent us out here, and he's sitting on tons of money. but he's decided that he has no responsibility to his son or anything. it's not like he's obligated to send us money, but he has so much and we have so little and isn't that the way family is supposed to work? i know my family would help us out if they could but we're all poor.

but i guess it doesn't matter. the important thing is that this has been a real learning experience. and, i finally got to see california. and, i miss all my people back home so much and i'm really excited to go back and see them all

the only thing is, it's so nice and sunny and warm here, and freezing in PA! *has a sad* :P"

"event","so, we spent the first half of august in south carolina/georgia with james' dad. it was pretty awesome. we played at some open mics and were well received, saw lots of crazy nature(as in freaking ALLIGATORS in the river) and bugs, got fat from eating out almost every night(hehe.. ""eating out"".. heh.. i'm such a tard), and got driver licenses. all in all, a fabulous vacation.

then, on august 18th, we flew on over to san diego! it was my first time on a plane, and i LOVED IT. especially the taking off/landing. it's like an ultimate rollercoaster! awesome! and then, we arrived at james' grandmother's (who will from now on be referred to as 'granjean') home. all of a sudden, it was not so awesome.

as i said, we arrived, only to discover a ridiculous mess. there were boxes everywhere, the kitchen was a mess, everything was in a state of general disarray. she showed us to our room, where there were two twin beds with boxes piled on top, some bedding haphazardly thrown on there, and cat puke on the pillows. please bear in mind that it was 11pm, meaning that it felt like 2am to us. and after flying all day, we were exhausted beyond belief. but we found some clean bedding, pushed the beds together, and finally SLEPT.

next day, we cleaned the place up, explored our new town, and felt a little better about things. spending some time in the california sun has a profound, uplifting effect on the mood. 

so, fast forward a week or two. i found a job at sears working in the shoe department, and i really like it. we're lucky in this respect, because jobs are incredibly scarce around here. things seemed to be going well with granjean. she's a very nice lady. it looked like we were going to be able to get her on a proper sleeping schedule, get her to take all her pills(quite a bit, mind you) and maybe even gradually start to improve her health. things are going great!

fast forward to RIGHT NOW. it turns out that granjean's been lying to us about what her doctors say to her. she's omitting things, and sometimes she'll decide that a doctor's order was really just some optional advice. and i'm starting to suspect that she's been throwing her pills away instead of taking them, because i haven't seen any improvement in her health since we started organizing her meds and making sure she's taking the right ones at the right times. also, she's still staying up until 2-3 in the morning and sleeping past noon. some people might not see why that's such a big deal, but waking up so late makes her disoriented for the rest of the day because she'll get up at 12:30 but think it's early in the morning. also, she's not supposed to drive but the other night she took the car out without telling us.

what does all this mean? she might need to go to a nursing home sooner than we thought. which means we're fucking screwed. james has been applying everywhere, but they all keep telling him they're not hiring. i'm working part-time at minimum wage. we can't support ourselves on that. the cost of living around here is IMPOSSIBLE. and i don't use that word very often. on our income right now, we could maybe afford half the monthly rent on a one-bedroom apartment. we've already been forced to spend almost half of our savings on essential things because we had no other source of income and we're basically paying for all the groceries and gas and stuff. 

i have always had some sort of backup plan. but not now. i have no idea what we're going to do.

i've already looked into housing assistance. they are no longer accepting applications, as there is already a six-year waiting list. we have no options.

other than going to live with james' dad, and i'm not even sure if that is an option.

but then again, maybe it's not all bad. i totally just saw a documentary on patagonia, argentina narrated by none other than alan ""sexy voice delivered from GOD"" rickman.

but seriously! fucking fuck in the suckhole FUCK!"

"event","okay, here's what's happening (WHAT'S HAPPENING!) on y100.. sorry, a little philly humor... i still miss that radio station, by the way...

ANYWAY,

so james and i have been in south carolina for about two weeks, visiting with his dad and stepmom. it's been pretty great, we've seen a lot of cool things, went fishing, eaten lots of delicious food, and whatnot. 

and i have to interrupt myself because james just got out of the shower and he's shaven off most of his beard! *mourns the loss* i love his big unruly beard.. hey, spellcheck says that ""shaven"" isn't a word. is that true? i'm totally using it anyway because it should be.

now then. 

we're leaving for california on the 18th, and i'm just a little nervous about the whole thing. there are a bunch of financial issues going on that i don't feel at liberty to discuss here, because it's someone else's business but i really hope this whole thing works out. and i really hope we can find jobs in a timely manner, what with the unemployment situation over there. we have nothing else to fall back on, and it's not like anyone else is in a position to help us.

but then again, james and i were both born poor and we've been scratching and surviving our whole lives. if we're anything like our moms, we'll get through it."

WOOHOO!!! *jumps around all crazy-like*

*ahem* and in three weeks, we're leaving pennsylvania. first, we're going to south carolina to stay with james' dad for a few weeks. then, we're headed out to california! james and i have been offered to stay at his grandmother's house, rent free, in exchange for helping her out with keeping the house clean, cooking meals, etc. we'll be living just outside of san diego.

i'm not changing my name, though. i deliberated over that for months. he's made it clear that it's totally up to me, since it's my name. he seemed relieved though, when i told him my decision. he said he felt that since our relationship is equal in every way, it wouldn't make sense for me to give up my name/identity and assume his. i'm proud of being a gaston, and i don't want to give that up. our kids will be gaston-garvin. our names are so similar, how cool is that?

we're having trouble finding a place to stay in austin. it would be so much easier if we knew someone there. i want to get out of pennsylvania so badly... it's hard, being poor and trying to live in one of the most expensive areas of the country. we have decent-paying jobs and yet we can barely make ends meet. the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment around here is $850-$1,000 per month, unless i want to live in a shitty place above a bar. and since the fire, i've been reluctant about that, to say the least. all i want is to work a regular job and live in a small, affordable apartment with my james. since when is that too much to ask for? my needs are simple. i'm worried. the lease expires on june 30th, and if we don't have a place lined up by then, we're homeless."

"event","talked to rob last night, everything's cool. i knew it would be. he and i get along way too well for something like this to mess up our friendship. we ended up hanging out for a few hours. once we start talking, it's hard to stop. now that i think about it, it feels more natural for us to just be friends and nothing more. we still kinda like each other but it's hard to explain. kissing him that time was nice but i can live without it. heh, it's not like i'm not getting any at home (love you james). all in all, i'm really glad everything is more or less back to normal."

"event","ok. so i'm planning to sort all this shit out with rob today, while james talks to laura. it's amazing how much your mind can change after taking 24 hours to think about it. we all just started feeling weird. well, i know laura and i did, and i'm pretty sure rob did. and james felt weird because everyone else did. i think i was just too excited about being excited that i forgot to think about if i really wanted something new or different. so, back to normal. i have to say, what a relief."

"event","eh, maybe james and i got in a bit over our heads.. we got too excited about our friends and forgot to think about the future and how things go wrong. nothing's wrong between us, so i think it would be best to just go back to normal. we love each other too much to fuck this up. ah well, the whole thing was fun to think about, but we just didn't think it through. i just hope shit doesn't get too weird between us and our friends. i don't think it will, as long as we're all just honest with each other."

i want to go run around in the woods. and go boulder-hopping. and find spiders as big as my hand. and little black snakes.

"event","i've been thinking a lot about a certain someone lately. is that safe? james and i both understand that having crushes on people other than each other is normal and healthy. but then, i suppose he thinks about his certain someone as often as i think about mine. funny thing is, i get excited when he talks about liking her. and he gets excited when i talk about him. the other him. and the sex has never been better. nothing really happens outside of the relationship. so it's a good thing? i'm not jealous, and neither is james. nobody could steal us away from each other. we're tight. it's just human nature to fuck around."

"event","i love my green tree frogs. they're neat. enid is 1.5 inches long and her color ranges from light green to dappled very dark green. she's an excellent hunter, and her favorite place is either on top of her bonsai tree, or hiding underneath. eddie's about an inch long, and his color ranges from medium dark green to almost brown. he's crazy. he got out once and leaped halfway across the room in one jump! his favorite places to sit are on the heating pad, and in the water dish. he also likes being under the bonsai tree with enid. ^_^ they're friends, but i've never seen them mate. i'd probably have to be up around 3am to see that."

and now for something completely different:
my mom is having brain surgery on monday, and i had a bad dream about it so i'm worried. well, i'm trying not to be worried because negative thoughts produce negative outcomes. but anyway, say a prayer for my momma, okay? i need her in my life. and my sister needs her even more."

"event","i actually had an argument with a coworker today. we were in the break room, and something on the tv mentioned lesbians. he said, 

""if my daughter became a lesbian i'd beat the shit out of her.""

now, you people know me. i avoid confrontation like the plague. i let a lot of things go. i worked it out in my brain, and decided there was no way i could ignore that. there are a few issues i'm passionate about, and this one just happens to be the big one.

i asked him if he was serious, and he was. i told him he was a fucking asshole. he acted like nothing he said was wrong. i told him he had no right to decide who gets to love who. and that hitting his children proved how weak he really was. then he started talking about the bible. i told him that most of the shit in the bible was translated by a bunch of power-hungry old men who decided it was okay to change, add or delete any texts at their discretion, and is therefore subject to interpretation. it's so far removed from what god actually is. and then he asked,

""so you think sodom and gomorrah was good?"" to which i replied,

""that doesn't make any fucking sense. you're completely missing the point.""

men are arrogant assholes. most of them, anyway.

in other news, there is no other news. i'm bored as fuck."

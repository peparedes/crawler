"event","Well thats me back at the parents for Christmas. The journey down was fairly scary tho! Darkness and fog are not good driving conditions but made good time, took about 3hrs.
 Presents are under the tree and the fire is glowing away. We are all settled watching Stardust and having a few drinks, its all very nice ^_^.
 Only drawback is that I dont get any phone signal here, afterall we do live in the middle of a field in the ass-end of nowhere! lol Will be online at points tomorrow, and back in Aberdeen late boxing day if your trying to get hold of me! Might manage to borrow a phone that works and send a few txts, but not sure yet, depends on how much credit people have!
 Anyway I'm off now to relax by the fire ^_^  I hope everyone has a good night and gets lots of nice shiney things tomorrow! Merry Christmas everyone!"

"event","Yup, bet you all thought I'd abandoned this thing!

But sorry to disappoint, I'm back! Cleared out all my old entries....again! I keep doing that

Think I'll keep doing this year at a time and hope that futre entries will not sound as
utterly weird as previous ones!

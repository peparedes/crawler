<P>i need to rant, read if you want, i kinda tapped into my deeper thoughts and philosophy.i have a whole part about emma and charlotte and the rest. read if you want.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""I swear to fucking god i'll kill myself before you""> </P>
<P>i dont think i ever saw the world the same way i'm seeing it right now. its winter. its fucking winter. and i fucking love it. i dont think any season could ever make me feel the same way as winter does. that perfect crisp cool, perfected weather. the way your warm breath feels as you breath in and out, on your cold chapped lips. i dunno something about all the feelings i associate with winter gets me all giggly and happy. winter makes me happy, its a happy season. Yesterday i did alot of thinking more thinking than i've done in awhile. i never typed it all out because i was sick, and not in the mood to even breathe. But i realized i'm in a point in my life where every move i take counts. like i'm being watched, but in a judgemental way. i feel as if the only thing in the world keeping me together is my art and my friends. I'll start with Emma. Emma, i love you, you defiantly inspire me to do amazing things. you are one of the greatest people in the world, your an amazing artist, and i can only prey that i can study the arts enough to become as amazing as you. you introduced me to so many great bands (the motherfucking used, glassjaw, and i THINK it was you who told me about elliott smith). Now Sarah. Sarah, you are an amazing personin so many diffrent ways. i've only read some of your poetry, but you could become something amazing if thats what you wanted, but you of course are already somthing amazing and beautiful. the way you can put words together and make them flow into eachother as if the words were made to go with each other. Charlotte, you should know by now how much i love you, i wrote a fucking essay about you how much more could you ask for? we've shared so much together in the short times we see each other. and we've had extrodianary experiences. Zoe, you are such a beautiful and sponatious thinker, i am truly graced to know someone like you. I am graced&nbsp; know someone like all of you. Eva, your so silly and great to be around. you make every situation a&nbsp; happy one, regardless of the circumstances. all of you are so extrodinaryly special to me, and so is the city. i somtimes think i'm going to collapse and give in if i dont see you guys. i love you guys so much, and i swear to fucking god if i had to i'd kill myself over killing any of you.one day i'll go to ellington, i'll furfill my dream of being in DC with you guys studying the one thing i pour my heart into. I need to find a way to move there, i might just have to run away and escape if thats what it takes. but emma, you and me and our plan needs to work, if we dont work our plan, i have no idea what else we'd do. start thinking, i'll keep dreaming. <FONT size=2><STRONG>GOD SAVES.</STRONG></FONT></P>

Today is World AIDS Day. I really dunno why but i've always been really into the fight against HIV/AIDS. but, i think thats a good site to visit, considering that it helps prevent/destroy stereotypes.
Another thing i've always been into is the fight against Domestic Violence. But on a happier note:

TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF W!I!N!T!E!R!!!!!

yess, i love winter. its by far the best season. i love the snow, the holidays, and just the general mood everyone is in! 

Ok Emma & Charlotte this parts for you:::

you, me, my mom, new jersy, MCR, on new years, NOW. yes thats right, if i can get my mom to fully agree to take a three day trip to jersy, which she probably will you guys and i shall go see the MCR show, in there hometown, on new years....does that not sound like the most fucking awsome idea ever. heres the thing, i would have to buy charlotte the book AFTER christmas, so you would still get it, just later. and emma, i couldnt buy you the CD, i'd buy you somehting else. maybe i can buy bert on ebay.....that'd be awsome. but you guys, we must go to that show. i got some wierd password thing thats gonna let me buy them, just gimmie $13.00 and the ""ok we wanna/can go!"" and it shall be done, and we will see MCR on new years...just the thought of it is purely orgasmic."

DUDE
thanksgiving weekend is gonna rock in everyway possible. i get to see my most defiantly favriot people. and i was thinking about things to be thankful for, and one thing that came up was beautiful people, not people who just look good, but people who are beautiful in and out. its really nice to have such poectic people such as elliott smith and brandon boyd (that one was for you charlotte). and i decided to make  list of things i'm thankful for.
poetry, music, art, my friends, skateboards that dont break easily, incubus, MCR, andrew, sarah, emma, charlotte, zoe, eva, nicky, trevor (i met him last week but what the hell.), elliott smith, my dad, leigh, my brothers, my mom. i know theres more, an di have this awful sense that i forgot one of the DC buddies.....  

i cant wait fo thanksgiving, i love all the fucking food! and it also means that quite soon, it shall snow! and after reading sarahs post earlier, i am definatly looking forward to winter in DC. i need to just move ther already, i basically live ther anyways
i have a bunch of shit that i left there anyway.

three years since emma introduced me to the used, three fucking years and now, on wendsday, those three years will pay off and i am going to go see them. i remember emma telling me to listen to them like, the day i met her, and indeed i did, and i fell in love. i cannot belive it. in three days i'm gonna see what i've been waiting for for about three years....amazing, emma, i love you, you are the best. 

My Weekend>>>>
I went to DC on......saturday. me, emma, charlote and andrew went to georgetown, and i found out how much i hate the bus, i totally spazzed and couldnt stay still....it was pretty funny.i bought a new sack-o-hack, its a really pretty color purple and i saw the most beautiful lighter in the world, and one day, i will buy it. it was a small orange lighter...it was beautiful.

"event","i feel so wonder-fucking-ful. i've never felt so loved, no one has ever done something that nice for me before, like, today, at like 9-ish andrew calls me while mcr is playing i'm not okay, i was ecsatic. i felt like i really cant explain how i felt, i wanted to cry i was so happy, but i couldnt. but, i was just, in complete bliss. i love MCR, sicks i cant go to the used either, man, that sucks! but if you think about it, i told my dad how upset i was, and hes like, you can go to like anyconcert you want next as long as you pay, so, i hope, i PRAY the distillers are coming soon, or a really good band. my uncle gave me the newest elliot smith cd today, he knew i'd like it, which i did. that man is so disturbingly beautiful, why did he have to kill himself. i need to hug someone really hard right now, i just have to much love for some reason, i need somone to take it out on, but all the lame-ass people here SUCK so i dont wanna hug any of them. well, my dad wants to move to dc now, but noe for a year he says, which is cool i suppose. as long as at some point i'm there, i'll be content. i just want all my friends in dc to know how much i love them. that means you emma,charlotte, andrew, zoe, sara, and all the rest, i have a really bad feeling i just forgot somone shit, i hope i didnt.

shit, i cant find my postal service cd.
love from me always

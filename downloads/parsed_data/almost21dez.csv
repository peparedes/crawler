But today was totally the non existent day!

First i walk into work and we have like a 50 top that has like banners and balloons up......They are taken over the whole freking side of the restaurant, which is real annoying.  And they take about an hour to get sat!

Then Monica the singer came in!!!  Yeah the one that sings that old song ""the boy is mine""  Her and her freakin body guard, which they only tipped 12 dollars, which was like 20% but still it is not like she needs to save her money..........But question is why would you go to the outback?  I mean come on, and especially the Clackamas outback!!!!

But anyway then this lady that orders food from Togo, thinks that she needs to park pretty much by burger king and is sitting out there wondering why nobody is bringing her food out to her!!!!  So i told Michelle that i am not going out there and given it to her!  It is called CURBSIDE take-away!!!  IT is not like the old days when the girls came out on roller skates!  I mean give me a break, i was cracking up!!!

Then like two seconds later this guy comes in that had a order for a salad, and he starts to dump change on the counter and tells me that he lost his bank card!!!!  I thought i was going to DIE!! Michelle had to leave because we were going to laugh so hard.......So this man started counting change out to me in Quarters and dimes!!!  He totally paid 5 dollars in change.  WHO DOES THAT???  I ran into the kitchen and started laughing so hard i thought that i was going to cry!!!!  

Then Michelle did not get cut till like 830 which was awesome for me!!!!  I was so bored!!!  i think that i got two orders after that so i made a grand total of i think 9 dollars tonight!

God, my job is so worth my time!!!!!

so yeah that is about it!  Today was weird! All in all!!!!

Michelle and Britt you know what else does not exist??????   HAHAHA!!!! That was so frekin funny last night!!!!   But it is sooooo true!

ANyway this was gay, but oh well, the whole day has been this way so it does not really matter........."

"event","I have never really been that close to my dad.  However the the last few years things have gotten better.  I have grown up and realize that life is to short not to get to know people.  And i think that he too has realize that he really did miss out on a lot of my childhood. 

The last few years it has been a sunday ritual to go see my dad, for me and my sister.  I, however have not got to go do it as much this year since i usually work on sundays.  But today was a day off, i went to my dads house and it was great to see him.  My sister has a horse( i know probably weird but i difiantly used to be a cow girl) and she keeps him at my dads.  So today we worked on fencing off another piece of the property so that the horse could have more room to run at times.  It was very hot out, and putting a fence where there is already tree's can sometimes be difficult.  It was not a normal fence it was this white wire stuff that you had to make sure was extremely tight at each post.  It was annoying.  However fun!.  I really do think that my dad is one of a kind.  Him and my uncle live on the same piece of property, and they act like they are still about 15.  I really hope that my sister and I can always have that kind of relationship and always know how to have a good time together............but really they are the weirdest guys!  they were building a pathway, from my dads house to my uncles.  They buy way to much stuff that way they always have plenty of room to mess up, then whenever they do mess up they just plants trees to cover it up.  Needless to say there is a whole lot of trees on that property!  

Anyway so that is what i did today.  It was fun, hard work and relaxing all at the same time.

There is really nothing like enjoying the day with your family, that is one place i always feel the  most content and relaxed!  I never have to prove anything to anyone of them."

"event","So monday was the day that i got my Wisdom teeth pulled.  I was knocked out, however when i woke up it hurt like hell. My face felt like it was the size a football, and i felt like shit, difiantly did not feel too attractive.  I could not eat anything all day but my stomach was screaming for food.  I never drank so much Gatorade in my entire life.  

But now i feel better today, and i think that the pain will be gone soon.  Not really excited to go to work today, but i know that i have too. 

It has been so nice outside and i have not got to enjoy the weather at all and that sucks.  Do not really have much to say so i think that i am going to end this post."

"event","Yesterday i drove down to my new school.  I went and saw the room that i am going to be living in and i got ht e names of my roommates.  Suddenly all the fears i had were washed away and they are overcome by excitement.  I can not wait!!!  The campus is so nice and the little town is so welcoming!  I can't wait!  I know i am going to have so much fun.  

Yesterday i finally told myself that i was going to meet new people and everyone up until this point that has influenced my life i will try to forget about.  I had not talked to one particular person in about 2 weeks and i was really starting to feel fine with that.  Then of course yesterday after i had returned from Western, he contacted me, i was full of excitement and told him that i saw my room and that i was totally final on going there.  His response was ""oh, you are really going there?  That sucks!""  When i asked him why it suck he said that i am going to be far away now!   But what does it matter to him?  I never see him and i usually only talk to him on line and on the phone once in awhile.  

Confused as hell, i asked why did it matter to him?  And all i got was ""never mind, it does not matter.""  

Right after that i had to get going to work, so i never got a complete honest answer.  So now pondering these thoughts in my head i do not really know what to think.  Really i could care less because i am not going to let anyone influence the decisions i make.  But he totally knows how i feel, and personally i think that he says things like that to keep me thinking the way i do.  But that is not right!!!!!!   Why would anyone want to mess with someones emotions that way?

As i read all my friends journal i find a similar topic.  I see that everyone has had someone say things to them, that really did they really mean?  I notice that in many situations they say something to one person, however tend to go home to another.  What the hell is that!?  

I know that i am not the only one in a weird situation with my feelings, but that is what upsets me the most.  I control my feelings just fine, i never let someone take over them.  Yeah of course i wish things sometimes and then i think of how it 'could' be, but i am a very introverted person all around.  No one really knows my bad days from my good.  But i feel that some people are more hurt by the things that people say to them, and that is not right!  

In one of Firorossi post she mentioned that her aunt says that ""A new bus drives by every ten min., and you never know who is going to be on it.""  I really liked this saying.  I think that it totally applies to every thing that i have been reading and feeling myself.  You never know when someone is going to walk through the door that could take your breath away in a min.  And if today know one did, keep looking and maybe tomorrow there will be.

I think that every one needs to keep there head up high and look for the good in every day.  If you get in a fight or if today is just not your day, well tomorrow is another day."

"event","Today at work we were very slow.  Nothing exciting happened, i was at the host stand talking to Angie most of the day.  But that is how it goes when you open on a sunday, so all is good.

Sitting here thinking that i need to go for a little jog but not sure if i want to or not.  I am just wishing that ""someone"" was on-line, which they are not.  You know, the bad thing is that I tell myself that i am not going to talk to this person anymore!  It is best for me and really for them(even though they would never admit it).  But then i always end up talking online.  Which i really enjoy talking to them, but then feel really guilty after.  

The thing is that i never want to hurt anyone.  I feel that by me talking to this person it could hurt others. And i do not like that!!!   The worst feeling in life is when you find out that someone you love has done something behind your back that you did not know about.  I would never want anyone to have to feel that way and know that i was the reason they felt that way.  But on the same line, i would never tell anyone they could not do something.  Then that prevents them doing something behind your back.  

All in all i think that if you are unable to trust your partner in anyway, even if that does include talking to people that you prefer them not too, then i do not think that you have a good relationdhip.  As well if you are not happy in your relationship then i do believe that you should find away to get out!!!!  Not having trust or doubting how much you care for your partner is not going to get either party anywhere.  I believe that at this point you are wasting each others time and should move on!!!!!  but whatever i guess whatever makes someone else happy could be different then what i think/feel.  But then i do believe that if someone is really happy they should let others know this and not pretend that they are not, or send messages to other people......

My point to this mess is way difficult to explain.  

I think that if you are in 'love' you should tell the world.....

If not, i think you should get out and not waste anybodies time and energy."

"event","Ever feel weirded out and really have no clue why?  

Well that is me.  I am in the weirdist mood, i feel anxious, tried, hungry (but not really since i just eat), and sad all at the same time.  Usually if i go for a little run it all comes out, but not today.  i ran my ass off this morning and i still feel the same.  I think that part of it is i am anxious to go away to school.  Even though it is only an hour away i am actually going to be away from my mom, my sister and all that i know.  I will have to adventure out meet new people.  Not that it is a bad thing, however i am a very shy person i like to stay in the safety zone were i know people.  All thourgh school i had the same group of friends and never really had any change in relationships, so going somewhere were i do not know anyone is really scary for me.  When i started working at outback this was a big step for me, for the only other job i ever had was working with my aunt.  This was going to be totally different.  This was the best thing i could have done!!!  I meet faboulas people, made friends that are great, and got a taste of the resturant bussiness(And i will probally never work in another one).  After the frist night of working there i came home and told my mom i wanted to quit!  The girls were all too cute, had too much money and i THOUGHT they were so stuck up.  By day by day i got to know these girls andi realized that none of these things were ture!!  I have grown to love them and see who they really are.   

This may seem very odd to some people that a job could change a person that much.  I really do feel like the last year i have changed and i have grown up alot.  

Prior to working at the outback i was in a relationship that was so not worth my time!!!!!  And all i knew at that time was how to go to work, at i job i had been at for 2 years, go to school and FIGHT.  Which was not good.  I hated it!  Every time i went out with his friends i felt uncomfortable for i was the youngest, and i never would talk.  I was told that i was too quiet.  which i am, but why do people care if i am quiet?  

Anyway back to the mood.  I know now that i am capable of meeting new people and making it out in this world alone.  But the fact that i am not going to be able to come home every night and sit at the kitchen table with my mom and tell her how my day went is really hard for me.  I know that i will have a phone and i will be able to call her, but it is different.  The weekends i will be home, and we can talk then.  I know all of this!!!  But my mom is one person in my life that knows everything about me, she knows who i really am, she knows what my goals are, what i think of different people, and mostly she takes the time to ALWAYS listen to me.  This may be weird to some people, for most people do not have a relationship like this with there mom. Mine is different, she never judges me for the stupid mistakes i make, and she is not one to tell me what i ""should"" do.  Sometimes i am like ""mom what do you think i should do"" and she always repleys ""whatever you think is best.""  

I think of the first day when i walk into my apartment and meet my roommate, am i going to like her? Is she going to be way cute?  Or is she going to be a book worm that never wants to do anything fun(god i hope not!)?  Will she become my best friend or will i never talk to her after the first term?  All of these questions go through my head, as i sit and imagine what it is going to be like.  It is weird to me to think that students leave right out of high school, man i was not ready!  I think of Angie(A great new hostest at the outback) she moved to Arizonia right after high school and she loves it.  And i am worried about moving an hour away.  How pathtic is that!?  Then i think of Kaylin(A hostest that left us at the outback) she moved to New York, not knowing anyone, moving in with a family that she had only talk to on the phone.  And i am worried about moving an hour away!?  i am such a baby!  

I  know everything will be fine after a couple of weeks, i know i will make new friends and i know i will love it.  I know that i can not take first impressions to far, i have to get to know the people first.  For that is how i have made it a year at the outback!"

Allen Jackson: 'Remember When'

Remember when I was young and so were you 
And time stood still and love was all we knew 
You were the first, so was I 
We made love and then you cried 
Remember when 
Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk 
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard 
We lived and learned, life threw curves 
There was joy, there was hurt 
Remember when 

Remember when old ones died and new were born 
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged 
We came together, fell apart 
And broke each other's hearts 
Remember when 

Remember when the sound of little feet was the music 
We danced to week to week 
Brought back the love, we found trust 
Vowed we'd never give up 
Remember when 

Remember when thirty something seemed old 
Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone 
To where we are, where we've been 
Said we'd do it all again 
Remember when 

Remember when we said when we turned gray 
When the children grow up and move away 
We won't be sad, we'll be glad 
For all the life we've had 
And we'll remember when 

Remember when 
Remember when"

"event","My friend who i have known since the 2nd grade is about to have a baby.  I can not imagine.  When she first found out i cried.  I could not get over it for the longest time, the sad thing is i think that i dealt with it harder then her.  Not that having a baby is a bad thing but she is so not ready.  I think that having a baby is a HUGE responsibilty and i do not think that it should be taken lightly.  She is a great person but not ready to be a mom.  I mean who is at the age of 20.  She still wants to have fun.  And that is where i have a hard time.  I feel that if you do have a baby that, that baby should be the top thing on your list for the next 20 years.  But she thinks that once it gets older she can have someone else watch it and she can still go out.   

Anyway the babies Daddy i do not really like.  He just turned 19, yeah that is right 19.  He never graduated and all he ever does is smoke Pot.  Hmmmmm hard to figure out why i do not like him huh?   But they fight all the time.  She has two months left and is working full time.  However she cries herself to sleep every night.  What is that?  I can not imagine.

She had to be at work at 8 this morning, and she called me at 1230 last night to see if she could come over and sleep at my house.  Of course i said yes, but then we did not go to bed till about 2 in the morning.  Poor thing had to get up and go to work.  I can not imagine.

I still want to be a kid, i still want to have fun, enjoy the life of going to school.  We have always been different, i have liked school, she has hated it.  But i never thought that this would happen.  Thought she was smarter, i mean how hard is it?  If you have sex use birth control.  But her life is going to lead such a different path then mine now, and i guess i will have to except that."

"event","so here i go to start one of these Journals since everyone else has one.  I have to say to start with that i am a very private person.  i do not really like to share very much of my private life with to many people.  There are a lot of people that know me, but really do not know too much about me.  It has nothing to do with them not wanting to know, it has to do with me not disclosing the information.  Sometimes i feel that this is a very strong aspect, however at other times i feel like i hurt myself more by not allowing myself to have feelings that others can see.  No matter what is going on in my life, when i see certain people i always put a smile on my face and say that i am doing great.  ""Fine, how are you"" is usaully the phrase i use.

One of my hopes of this journal is to get to know other people more, and for them to get to know me.  I feel that this is a great way to expres yourself without having to tell someone face to face.  

Kay is comming home tommorow night and i am sooooooo excited.  We are going to have a surprise for her at the airport.  i am so happy for her that she took such a huge risked and moved across the country alone.  But that is where she belongs, that is her city.  But for me to move across the country would be out of the question in my head.  I am worried about moving an hour away.  Not that i do not think that i can live on my own, it is just the fac that my family is not going to be in the next room.  What if i have a problem with the computer?  I am not good with these things!  I am used to yelling ""MOM, I NEED HELP""  that is what my mom does for a leaving, why should i have to figure it out?  I have her.  But soon i will not, soon i will be an hour away.  Wow, that sounds so riduculas........

Will continue later.........things happen in llife that you can not control.  sometimes things come up and you have to drop what you are doing, to help the ones you truley do love."

"event","<P>I had an awesome breakfast with my Grandpa's! When Dad was alive, he would take out us children for our Birthday's, but since the Lord called him home, our Grandpa's take us out. I think that we kids, Jonathan, Cristin, Amy, Daniel, Michelle, and Me have the BEST Grandparents in the WORLD!!!!!!! :-) </P>
<P>Here is a picture (link to the picture!) of my Grandpa's and me (after we ate.)</P>
<P><A onclick=""return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)"" href=""http://tinypic.com/jr5zb6.jpg"" target=_blank>http://tinypic.com/jr5zb6.jpg</A></P>
<P>When we got done eating, my Grandpa's took me to the store to get something flowery for my Mama, in the end I got Mama, a petite white rose plant. I liked it a lot but, I wasn't sure is Mama would like it, but she did! You might wonder, why on earth I would give Mama a rose plant on my birthday, the reason being... It's a way that I could say, 'Thank You', to her for giving birth to me. :-) </P>
<P>I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO blessed to have such a WONDERFUL family, it's not even funny! All of my family, like my Cousin's, Aunt's, Uncle's, and Grandparents all claim that they follow the Lord. Which is SUCH a blessing. For when we get together, we are not that&nbsp;shy, cause we all know&nbsp;where we stand.&nbsp;We do have are different standards, and stuff,&nbsp;but the main thing is:</P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><FONT size=4><STRONG>That the follow and love&nbsp;the Lord with a happy heart!</STRONG></FONT> &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>I better be going! I just wanted to post a BIG 'Thank You' to all those who have/said that will, give me a birthday card! How VERY thougthful you guy's (GIRL'S!!! ;-)&nbsp; are! You just make me smile! :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)<FONT size=1> I think that you get the point! ;-)</FONT></P>
<P>~Sarah</P>
<P>P.S. I hope that some of the stuff make since! :-) Or I might just be going CRAZY!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P>I was getting to bed pretty late every night this last week. But on Sunday, I was just a human-being, doing nothing but living (maybe not even that! ;)! In other words... tired!!!!!&nbsp; After a LONG day on Sunday, I came home and was helped unload our car. When Daniel called out... ""Sarah, can you come rub my legs?"" ...I answered back, saying I will as soon as I can. I went to D-boy's bed (Daniel), and instead of rubbing his legs, talked with Him. Then he said that he need to talk to mom. I really think he wanted to get out of bed, but who knows! ;-) And when he came back he pleaded me to stay for just a FEW seconds, so I did... ...a WHOLE night! I woke up in the middle of the night with D-boy's legs, kicking me! No, I wanted my bed, but I was just toooooo tired to go to my bed. So I paid for it today!&nbsp; I hope that I can get a REALLY good sleep tonight! </P>
<P>Sarah</P>
<P>P.S. Today, if my Dad where alive, He would have been the BIG <FONT color=#00cccc size=6><STRONG><U>5</U>-<U>0</U></STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>! You can pray for us, and Grandparents. Thanks!</FONT></FONT></P>

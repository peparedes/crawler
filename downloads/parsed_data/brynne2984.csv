"event","This weekend and week before this have been really bad, but yet very funny. You know drama is only drama when you care I on the other hand just laugh in its face and move on. I went on a date I just blah.. I don't know how to explain that one. I am just not clicking with people now a days.  Then again I am also looking for that person to spend the rest of my life with so, its a bit harder. Plus I have to stop myself from falling to fast. Its just a balance game. A lot harder than when I was in high school. Okay now for my week/weekend. 

Last friday- We went out to slips because we thought Ryan was going to come hang with us but umm no. So we decided to go to Malarky's to meet up with Ryan Elliot and his friend. That was okay. I am not a big fan of local bands so we went inside to pee and dance. Guess who we saw no other but Jeremy. Go figure that I spent my whole night trying to avoid where he was at and I still ran into him. When I saw all the black Fusions we should have left, but we didn't. We stayed there for a bit. We ran into Ryan and all his friends. They are cool, then we went back to slips. We met up with some guys there. They were nice, but yeah Tasha sucks. They wanted us to come over and I was like um no. Ofcourse Tasha asked one of his friends to ride with us, so they could give us directions because I needed to go home to get my damn phone charger because my phone died. I sat in my house a little longer than need be because I wasn't exactly sober and I was talking to Jeremy to see how his night went. He then asked me to bring Tasha over so he could figure out how she gave head. I told Tasha about that and she got pissed as hell. Understandably so. I got so pissed I just don't understand guys like that. Thats just rude as hell. When went to this guys house he was cool I feel asleep on the couch with his cute ass dog. That was fun. 

Wednesday- Went on a date with Dave. Yeah that didn't work out. I dunno theres something about a guy that wears black tennis shoes that just turns me off. I hate black tennis shoes. Ugh. Not only that but he couldn't handle my sarcaism and made me drive his car. Then we went to the movies and I bought the movie and then the bar and I bought the first round. The first date should be on the guy. I am not one that makes guys buy me stuff or even pay for everything, but the first date should be on the guy. It didn't help that I couldn't see myself with him either. He was a sweet guy and everything just not for me. 

Thursday- This was a very interesting day. LOL. I was standing in the living room talking to my mom and dad and our neighbor was stareing right inside our living room. He was looking at us from his window. It was creepy. They won't let me do anything about it though. I called Joe for the first time just to tell him about this incident. He ended up calling me back later. hes such a sweet guy. We shall see how this goes. I am excited we have plans for tomorrow.   Then I went to the bar with Tasha. We ran into the guys we met last friday and Tasha ended up drinking to much and got sick in the bar bathroom. While I was trying to get her to leave this stupid bitch got up in my face and starting yelling at me for something that happened over a year ago. Its funny because she was like I was so going to kick  your ass if you didn't leave when you did. I'm like dude you wouldn't have kicked my ass trust me. LOL people don't realize that I am trained in pressure points. Man oh man. That as horrible. I was done to and ready to leave. Got Tasha home safe and sound then came home myself. Mike ended up driving me home and I ended up talking to Joe for over and hour and a half. Ugh.. OOOOO MAN!! I so almost drove to see him just so I could cuddle with him. 

Friday- I hung out with Abby, Greg, George, and Justin tonight. We all went bowling. It was fun I locked my keys in my car all because of Joe. I was on the phone with him and forgot them in the back seat. LOL. Seeing Abby for the first time was awesome. I haven't seen her in like eight or nine years. Oh man. I missed her tons. I remember when we use to be best friends. those were the fun days. LOL. 

Now I am laying around at home. I am so damn tired. So I am going to sleep. This was my drama filled week. Sounds fun eh? I thought it was funny though. HAHA. ."

"event","I can't stop thinking about last night. Hes one of the most wonderful guys I have ever met. He opens car doors, cuddles with me, and talks and says sweet things to me. Just laying in his arms makes me happy. Kissing him is time stopping. I just met this guy and I can't help but trust him. I want to give him so much he was telling me how crappy his christmas is and I just want to give him a christmas. Even if it is small. I just want to decorate his apartment and buy him some gifts and just make him happy. I have never had such a desire to do this. I hope this one is for real. It happened by pure accident so I wasn't looking. Hes very cute, sweet and just the best person I have ever met. Ugh. I dunno. I want it to work this time. I've never trusted a guy like I trust him. Oh boy."

"event","Yes I am going to up date because I gotta get some stuff out. Lately has been fun. I have been going to Canada alot lately with my awesome friend Jes. I don't remember what I said last time I updated but if it had anything to do with Greg thats done. Hes a complete ass so I'd much rather just stay away from that. He turns out that he was talking to two people at one time it was a huge mess well guess who ended up getting hurt. HAHA me. Then I started talking to one of Ryan's friends Robbie well that didn't work out he ended up with Jes. Guess who got a little bit hurt there. ME!! Oh well on that one though. Its not worth losing good friends over. Then the last time we went to Canada we met up with Jes's friend Bradley, well him and I tried dating awhile back but Jes liked him so I backed off. Then when we met up in canada I don't know there was something there. I couldn't believe how connected I felt with him. Who knows where that is going he left for Alabama the next day. Go figure that. Once again I will prolly get hurt. Then there is Joe and Greg. I don't know how to explain it. I am not exactly impressed. I guess I am just trying to concentrate on Bradley more so than anyone else. I don't know where any of this is going. I just really want to see me with Brad. We would be totally cute together and hes so just my type. Its funny I like how hes so sweet but is more than willing to tell you when he is pissed off. Yeah he can be an ass about it but I rather it bluntly not then not at all. Who knows. I have to get some studying done for Taylor Auxiliary. Oh well I will try and keep everyone update."

[The crowd starts chanting ""Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!""]

Jerry: Tonight on ""The Jerry Springer Show"" we have a particularly interesting episode! Rhonda is here to finally confess something to a long-time friend, Rachel. So everyone, please put your hands together for Rhonda!

[The crowd whoops and hollers]

Jerry: Okay, now Rhonda you're here to talk about someone aren't you?

You: Yes.

Jerry: And what is this other person's name?

You: Ryan.

[The crowd squeals with delight]

Jerry: Okay, okay, well Ryan, is actually here tonight ...

[The crowd squeals]

Jerry: But first we have a surprise for you Rhonda, because as it happens there is someone else here to see you! So let's bring out ... Tasha!

You: What the HELL!!!

[Out of nowhere you pull out a Tec-9. Tasha reaches for the Chair. Out of the shadows Bob appears]

Bob: Wait everybody, wait!

Jerry: Yes, everybody let's just calm down for a moment here. First, tell us why you're here Tasha.

Tasha: Because I saw Rhonda and Bob making out at Meijer!

[The crowd goes absolutely insane]

Bob: That's a lie! I was home watching The OC!

Jerry: [raising his hands] Hold on, hold on, I'm missing the problem here ... what exactly is the problem Tasha?

Tasha: Because I've recently been taking part in a sexual relationship with Rachel who has recently become engaged to Bob.

[The crowd hollers, screams and whoops in an orchestra of orgasmic excitement]

Jerry: Okay, okay. Well why don't we bring Rachel out here because Rhonda had something that they needed to tell them anyway about ... Ryan that's right!

Rachel: [enters onto stage and saunters over towards you] What's the deal? I saw you outside getting it on with Ryan! You know how I feel about Ryan!

Bob: [screams] What? Why the hell did you ask me to marry you if you're in love with Ryan!

Rachel: Because I knew that I could never have Ryan. But Rhonda promised me that they'd never hook up out of respect for my feelings!

Bob: What about respect for my feelings!

[Tasha walks suddenly across the stage, embracing Rachel]

Tasha: Don't worry baby, you don't need any of them now that you have me.

[Again the crowd squeals]

Bob: Oh my God! Are you sick!?

[Bob runs across the room and wraps their arms around you tightly]

Bob: Rhonda take me away from all of this!

You: You see? That's the thing ... I'm ... well, I'm married ...

[The crowd does its bit]

Bob: Married?

[You nod]

Bob: Who the hell are you married to? When ... when did this happen? I don't understand!

You: The other day. In Vegas. I'm married to Ryan.

Rachel: [screaming] WHAT!!!

Jerry: [grinning widely, makes an enquiry] So ... did you have a nice wedding night?

Ryan: [stepping back out onto center stage] Well we had sex 4 times if that's what you mean.

[The crowd squeals]

Jerry: Okay, okay. So let me get this all straight ... Rhonda is married to Ryan who Rachel has secretly been in love with for years and years. Now Rachel has recently become engaged to Bob who was recently spotted kissing Rhonda in Meijer. Now on top of this, Tasha has just admitted to being in a sexual relationship with Rachel.

Ryan: That's right Jerry.

Jerry: [looking sternly into the camera] It's times like these that one has to wonder whether or not these people are aware that they are quite clinically insane. Perhaps we should be spending more on psychiatric health funds in this country, perhaps we should just ban Vegas to cut down on impulse marriages. Perhaps I should get a new job. Thanks for watching folks - it's been great - but for now, take care of yourselves ... and each other.

[Cue cheesy background music and fade to black]

For those of you that didn't know I work for sears now. They rock. I have not been so happy at one job. Its something I can do. I have another interview for the Taylor Police Department. Of course its only voluntary but hell its experience. That will help me alot with deciding what I want to do in school and where I want to be in a few years. I am learning alot about my friends this semester. I don't miss the guys at all. Not hanging out with them is helping me concentrate on school. That idea right there is awesome just because I want to graduate sometime in the near future. My ""best friend"" neglected to tell me something that is huge and now i just don't know. I am really hurt because she told so many other people other than me but yet I am supose to be a really good friend of hers. I don't know it just doesn't seem right to me. I don't even hold anything back from her and yet she holds that something back from me. That really bugs me. I actually didn't even find it out from her I had to find out from other people by pure accident. Now that I look like a fool even more so with some certain people I'm feeling rather good. Other than that problem I had a very enjoyable day. I have one of my favorite teachers this semseter and she remembers me which is even nicer. I am outtie I'm really tired I've been up since nine am and its now almost two am. Don't know whos going to read this but I love you."

"event","Only so it numbs the pain!!

I have yet to figure out how one can have so much emotion built up inside. How they can only let it out once ever six months and how it is that the one person they want to help just sits at the computer chair trying to talk about it online. Did it ever occur to you that I WANT TO TALK IN PERSON???? Oh damn thats right you just don't care. So lets start off with a little ante-dote that put me into my mood. 
I don't usually work on Tuesday's in Photo and honestly I don't think I ever want to again. This Tuesday I had the worst customer ever and this includes when I worked up at the Service Desk. She came and first started talking to the Media lady when I noticed that she was raising her voice thats when I walked over to help her. Well she was asking for a service that we don't have in our store yet and I kept trying to explain to her that we didn't have the service and she kept telling me to shut my damn mouth. Finally I got so mad at her yelled that at me I threw four envelopes on the counter with a pen and walked away.(The only reason I got so mad is b/c my parents don't talk to me that way neither should some lady.) Then I walked away from her and She was like get you god damn ass back over her. At that point I started shaking. (When I get pissed and want to throw something at you or just punch you I start shaking and walk away.) I then called my manager to deal with her. She started yelling at him and he didn't get so much as one word out. Well she said that she was going to take her film else where and he was like please do. I was hoping she would leave. Yeah right! Then my manager called in the acting store Director and she was nice as can be to her. Can you believe that. Damn drug addicts that live in Taylor and Lincoln Park need to start shopping in their own town stores. 
After her you figure it only got better. Which it did. I Helped this lady with the digital machines and she bought me some pudding which is almost gone. It was mighty yummy. 
Moving on to Wednesday. See I thought I would have a day off from work. Haha yeah right. Jack ass Jeff called off so I had to go into work. He makes me so damn mad. If I could pick him up and throw him out a window I would trust me. Then that night I said the worst thing ever. Trust me I thought I was better but guess what I'm not. When I went to go talk to my mom when i got home about the package that I was sending to my grandma I told my mom that I was looking up grandma and grandpa's address on the internet. Theres a problem there I don't have any grandpa's so that night is when I learned Im not over having to buried my grandpa. I learned that I've been trying to fight it by myself but I just can't its not possible. I need someone there to cry to to sit down with and hold me and not just say anything. I just don't have that. HOnestly I don't think I ever will. 
Now I am just not happy. Rachel hates me for some reason. What it is I don't know. Ryan well I am talking to him now and I can't seem to tell him what I want to say b/c guess what he can't figure out ten mins to hang out with me anyways. I just don't get it. 
It's funny how the stuff you don't admit hurts just as much. I know how my friends really think and feel towards me and even though they say they love me I know whats behind it. I know im the worse person ever I know I make everyone feel like shit, so what is the sense in talking to me. You all know all thats going to happen in the long run is your going to get hurt. So back away while you can. Leave me to live a life by myself so you guys don't feel the pain. Let me feel every bit of my pain with every shattered piece of my heart let me die with all my regrets and let all my pain just sink deeper and hurt more."

"event","I have to know something. Do you that the person you like for over a year could actually be the one you end up with?? See I like this guy for a long time and now we are talking and stuff, he left for a cruise on sunday and I saw him saturday before he left. He even told me he didn't think he'd see me before he left so you knew how surprised I was when I did get to see him. Well hes gone now and I miss him so much. I didn't even miss him this much when I saw him one Wednesday then the next after that. That just as long as he'll be gone. I don't get it. I guess it might have a lot to do with when I didn't see him for that week I still knew I could see him when ever I wanted to. Now I have to wait for him to come back to see him. I am sure he will call me when he gets back because its him. Im sure he'll want to see me. Oh well I gotta go tow ork I am so gonna be late again. OH WELL!!!"

"event","I figured something out today. Even though I love Ryan more than anything it's not going to happen. You know its funny. I want a guy that if you ask them to go out with you will be like not tonight but maybe tomorrow, or Im sorry im busy for the moment but I'll call you later. Honestly thats not Ryan. I can't say I didn't give him more than one try with this. I have given him plenty of chances. I want a guy thats not afraid of me meeting his parents, b/c you know I think your parents know best for you and if they like them then that person just might be the one. I want a guy thats going somewhere in life just so I can have the thrill of going with him, or so he can go with me when I go somewhere in life. I want a guy that will help me achieve my goals and you know once again thats not Ryan. You know I don't know how much this is asking, but all in all I found the guy I want just a matter of time before I get him."

"event","Okay so I learned I have been in love. Not with who I thought I had first fallen in love with but with Ryan. Most of you know I had thought I had fallen in love with Max but now that I look at it I don't believe so. I think the only guy I fell in love with was Ryan. I finally know what love is to me atleast. It's weird I wasn't even really thinking about this and it just came into my head. Love is when you have a guy who no one else thinks is cute but you think hes the hottest person in the world. Love is when you can go days with out seeing him but when you do the time stops and minutes pass slower. Love is when he does bad things and you just ignor every bit of it. Most of all I know I love him because when we aren't boyfriend and girlfriend hes the only one I ever miss. He's the only one I ever want to be around, and hes the only one I can ever think about. I don't know how to explain all my feelings I have to him because you know what anytime hes my boyfriend I don't even look at another guy I know that I have the most perfect one for me, so why even look. When we are together if another guy is hitting on me I don't even notice because I know Im going back to him. 
It's funny he once asked me if when we were dating if I ever thought him and I were going to get engaged and you know what out of fear I didn't answer honestly. My answer to that question was yes each and everyday I was with you and each and everyday we spent apart. I just wanted the honor of saying such a great guy loves me. I wanted to know that I would have such a great guy for the rest of my life, but now I'm not even sure if I will ever get him back. It took me a long time to realize how much I really do care for him, but usually time means to late. So with that I know it's to late but hell I'm glad at one time or another I had this kind of feeling with a guy."

"event","The other night I went to the bar with Brian out in Farmington Hills to see Debbie. Well they have a regular there lets call him John and we were talking. He was telling me how I need to do more stuff for me rather than everyone else, but you know what I like not having to do alot of stuff for me. I am a very self less person. I love that about me. I am more than willing to please anyone and everyone than myself. There are so many things I wanted my grandpa to see before he died and he only saw one, me graduate high school. I wanted him to see me graduate college get an awesome job, get married to the most wonderful guy, and most of all I wanted him to meet his great grandchildren. Hopefully I had a girl because we don't have that many women in the family. I was his only grand daughter. I don't want to do these things for myself because there are people out there wanting me to do them to show them who I really am. Selflessness is not something I have been my whole life just something I have been the last few years. I learned after going through everything I went through. Don't get me wrong I know there are times when I have to be self fish, Honestly one of those times is right now and I am being self fish, but I don't have to like it. Oh well. I am slowly becoming more happy. Hopefully I am really happy soon."

I kinda thought the days forward were suspose to get better not worse, but hell if you see a smile look a little harder its there to fool you. I haven't smiled because I was happy in over three months and I don't think anyone has noticed. My smiles have been hiding away fear, pain, and just pure thoughts of not wanting to be here. I've been drinking alot more to mask the pain I have. Life really sucks. On to my next problem which is big. 
I really like this kid who happens to be my brother's room mate and best friend. I don't see the big deal maybe because I am not the older brother and hes not the younger sister, but in my eyes if I know a guy is good and I had a sister I would want her to date him. I would want her to be happy, but guess fucking what. I can't be happy b/c my brother sucks and he needs my brothers okay. Gosh dang it!! Oh wells that all i have to say. I'll talk to everyone lata."

"event","I watched American Wedding tonight and damn do I miss having a boyfriend. I mean I had two boyfriends willing and ready to marry me what the hell did I do wrong. I'm almost positive only one of those two marriages would work, but I doubt anyone will want to marry me now. American Wedding is one of those movies were it really makes you think about getting married and how perfect that one day needs to be for the girl. I mean I am lame and I do have a lot of stuff already planned for my wedding but who doesn't. Yeah I see it in my head the flowers are going to be Red and White roses because the colors of my wedding is going to be Red and White. My dress is going to be either strapless or have the sleves that are on the side off the shoulder and the front is going to be opened with satin down inside the opening and bead work coming all the way up on both sides. My maid of honor dress is going to be red and built like mine if i don't get it strapless but without the bead work. I am not sure about the rest of the brides maids dresses though. I want it either out side in the u.p. by the water in a Gazebo or in doors at Greenfield Village they have a old time small church. Its really pretty. Possibly at Elizabeth Park on one of the bridges there. I mean yeah they are crumbling but it's still so beautiful. My last option is inside a church the one down in monroe is so pretty. The Entrance way is a perfect shot for a wedding photo. Its cathloic, but I have never been inside. The reception isn't that big of deal my husband and I can plan that, but the wedding song I want is either Nothing on but the Radio (its country) or Dancing in the moonlight. I know all this is really lame but I had to vent it out so bad. Don't think I plan on rushing into getting married thats not it at all. I can wait trusth me and I plan to Its just every girl plans their wedding and I happen to watch a movie that made me miss having a boyfriend so much. I want a guy that will give me the perfect wedding and go to the extreme like they did in the movie."

"event","I am waiting for Rachel to call so she come get over here and I can go to sleep. I figured while I was waiting I would write about my night. 
First I worked. It wasn't all that great. I hate working there. I really wish I had another job and I could just quit but it just isn't happening for me like that. I worked my crappy four hour shift came home and went to sleep for about thirty mins.
Dan called me and wanted to go get something to eat so to save myself from having to listen to anything he had to say I said lets go to Red Robin. They have ESPN on all the time so it would give me something that I was actually interested in watching and I wouldn't have to talk. I actually had a little fun with Dan. While I was hanging out with Dan my friend Chris was IMing me on my phone to see if I wanted to go to the bar. I felt rude so I told Chris I'd call him in like ten mins and tell him what was up. He said he was going to play walleyball and due to the fact that I haven't done that since my 16th birthday party I wanted to go. We went it was fun. Lots of fun times there. Then we went to Baskin n Robins and hung out with the people we played walleyball with. Chris decided he wanted his friends to meet me, so we went to Denny in Taylor. (YUCK) It was one of his frat brothers and his ""wife"". LOL!!That was so much fun. We made fun of the waiter. I assulted Scott. HEHE!! and I got to hear about Rats. Chris and I then went to get my car and we sat and talked for a little bit. (I have to explain something at the end) I called Rachel to see if we could go visit her and Greg for a few. Rachel was like sure and we sat there and thats when I found out I am the life of the party. HEHE!! Im so happy. Life would not be funny without me. :)
Now the something I have to explain. I am really amazed that Chris and I are still friends. See when him and I first met I was with .... and we could really do anything. Esp since I am me and I am completely faithful to whom ever I am with. It was easy then to help him with finding other girls and listening him talk about other girls. See now its different. I finally have my life how it should be and it kind of sucks. I know he likes Emily and I don't want to screw that up in anyway. I want him to be happy, but you know I have bad timing too. I like him now. I don't want him to give up anything he has now for me because whos to say it will work. Im weird and who knows, but then again whos to say it won't. I don't know I kinda feel bad because I shouldn't do that to him right now esp since he likes her. Ahh oh well we shall see what will happen."

Brian, Sarah, Aaron and I all went bowling last night till around 12:30. It was fun. I really suck and it was only nine pin. Ugh. Go figure. Brian drank so much there though. It was his first new years being 21 so no biggie. He did karaoke that was really funny. No offense to anyone but that go boring so we left. We went to go see my parents at the party they were at b/c the people my parents hang out with are really close to me also. I figured I should stop there too. It was alot of fun. We played cards and I played with the cute dog they have. Brian did shots with my parents and stuff. Then we went out to the frat house. OMG!! I was so happy to see that Adam was in town. I didn't even know he was. It was funny right when I saw him through the window I ran into the house and gave him the huggest hug ever. He lives in Portland now :'(. I mean he loves it there but its funny how things work out. See I have known him for about a year. Before he left him and I started talking alot more. He left in August right before school started again. Last night we spent a good three hours talking while playing pool. It was nice he told me all about Portland and warm and nice it is there. I want to go there now. Its right in the middle of everywhere I want to visit anyways. I could do that and see him. Benefit of both worlds right there. 
Ah well I don't think it would ever work though. Hes so far away. Its a 5 hours plane ride. UGH. I just don't think anything could come of it. Go me to start liking someone that live far away."

"event","I am actually happy enough to write one. This is the first time I have been this happy in forever. So lets see where to begin.
  Ryan and I broke up. I broke it off with him for the first time. I'm not sure if I am hoping it's over with or if I am hoping he comes back. I just figured I'd make it easier for him because he didn't have anytime. I still love him don't get me wrong I love him alot, but I can't watch him suffer when just being a part would make me suffer for a only a little while. New theory ""Shit happens"". 
  Then there are my guys. OMG!! They have been there so much for me lately. I love every single one of them. They are seriously the greatest people ever. I hadn't really been hanging out there very much because of Ryan but after we broke up I remember why I love it there so much. They always seem to make me happy. The know when I am upset how to change my frown and turn it upside down. I have never felt so close to a group of guys in forever until now. I got drunk with them on thursday and somehow ended up in my boy's bed. LOL I have no idea how I climbed his latter. Ah well no bumps or anything that I don't remember getting. I remember everything else from that night but that. It was nice though to wake up in his arms and neither of us know how I got there. Only problem is I was hung over the next day. Ah well I so lived. Oh yeah and guess what I really suck at Beer Pong.
  Tuesday night I went back out to the house. Jason wanted to talk to me and Brian and I were trying to figure out if it was to warm to go Ice Skating. We didn't end up going Ice Skating which sucks. I still really want to go. I don't know how but that makes it all the more fun. The guys had something to do so Krystal and I stayed at the house and watched Kill Bill 1 and 2. Theres yet another person I am happy I got to spend time with. I never really got to know her but shes totally awesome. Shes just got a glow that makes people love being around her and thats totally cool. Then we all went to the Bar. That was fun. I had a beer. I was good. Brian didn't feel well so we left. I actually think we left for other reason, but I am not going to go there. Then I went home.
  Today I went to Max and Erma's for their fundraiser thing in Sterling Heights. It's kinda nice out there. I had a blast with Debbie and the guys tonight. That's what made me so happy. The waiter was to die for OMG!! Debbie and I accidentally dropped a pen so we could check out his ass. LOL. It was cool though. I don't always get the time to hang out with her. I wish she was around alot more. She's awesome. I'm so happy for her though for once no once hates her in the house.
  So I am pretty upset. I am an adult and I do things as an adult, but it pisses me off when someone acts like they are ten. I will never understand that but what do I care they lie alot anyways.
  Really thats it I don't want to get into the bad things well because they suck. The good things are what I am going to be overly grateful for right now."

My response back to that was well he'll be back then he always comes back. He was just upset with me for asking him if he was hanging out with other girls. I talked him into go to eat lunch with me at the mall and he went and then we were walking out and he was talking about getting old with me and stuff. It was so cute.

I am tired of listening to people not be cool to one another, I am tired of hearing stuff and when i talked to someone else about being told that was wrong of me, and most of all I am tired of people telling me who I should like and who I shouldn't. I just want to try and work everything out with Ryan and thats it. I don't care about anything else but making this work. I love the boy so much. Ugh him and I will prolly have a nice talk tonight. I need to talk to him about everything. He thinks I am nuts but I am not I just listen to everything. Just for one final thought If you tell me something and you dont want to know what I think dont tell me then. Right Cindy????"

"event","You all knew this was coming. I have offically installed an open and close neon sign. I am tired of listening to everyones problems because they have been making them mine. I don't care anymore. I need to concentrate on making somethign work with Ryan instead of everyone else. I am sorry if thats selfish but guess what thats how it will be for awhile. I am madly in love with this guy and I am fing everything up because I can't be happy. He hates it when I am not happy. I love being happy but its hard when I hear stupid shit and it really doesn't pertain to me and its very in material. I am sorry not meaning to offend anyone, but I can't handle my problems when I am having them much less anyone elses. Well atleast right now I can't handle anyone elses problems. Its funny I have been head over heels for this guy for a long time and for once we both want it to work. It's going to work.Blah to that. Oh well I am not going to vent cause I have done enough of that, so ttyl."

"event","Let me explain something before you all think I am odd. See when Ryan and I frist started dating he talked to me on the phone a little bit not much but to say Im coming to get you and we are going out. Which was good cause then we got into his truck and talked more. Loved it. Since then my phone has not been used to talk to him but ever so often and only to make sure I was okay after we got done fighting online. Imagine how surprised I was when I two-wayed him last night on my way to the bar and he actually answered. LOL!! Frist time we talked on the phone in forever. We talked till I got to Detroit just long enough for me to get lost. So I finally make it to the bar after....
      I call Brian to ask him where the Heck I am and I can't hear him because hes already at the bar right? I ask him to walk out side and hes like why? Im like because I can't hear you. Let me add I got lost in downtown Detroit. I finally said screw it and hung up the phone and decided to find my own way to the bar. Then when I finally reach the bar I was like hey will you come out and walk me in and hes like why? ARGH!! Isn't it that darn obvious I didn't want to walk in by myself. GR!! I got really annoyed. Im not going to get into the rest of my night it was so damn bad. Moving on to today.....
      Today was okay. I had school till 5:55, that sucks. I hate being there that late. I went to the Library to do my essay didn't even have to turn it in. Blah on that. Then Ryan called me while I was in Courtney's apartment. That was exciting he never calls me. HEHE!! Then called me when I got home. Thats what I am doing right now Talking to My wonderful Babe. I'll Write later though."

"event","I am doing okay I supose. I just wish people actually understood why I keep Ryan on good terms and actually care. He's been there for me a lot lately and even though he doesn't want me to listen to him I can't help that. I really do love him and for some reason hes the guy I see myself with in like ten years. It's funny I have a good judgement of charcter and I wouldn't keep him as a friend if I really didn't think it was going to improve. I really care about him and its in a odd way. Not like I usually care about people. I care about how I look, act and feel when I'm around him or talking to him. I feel so happy when I think about him, or when I hear his name. Just seeing him at work makes me all sweaty and my heart skip like a million beats, and thats not even just the frist time I see him thats everytime. When I'm with him I have butterflies in my tummy the whole entire time. I've not been so happy with a guy in my whole life, and for once I am happy with him. More than likely because hes such a challenge for me but if I didn't try for stuff I wouldn't be the person I am today."

"event","Just about done with the semester! I can't believe how fast it's flown by. I got an A- in philosophy of biology. Horray! Just had my government final this evening. Hard confusing questions but I think I did okay. All I have left now is to pass in a paper that I haven't started yet for sociology! I will lock myself away tomorrow and write it. I should be happy and relieved but I'm pretty stressed out anyway. 

Still worried about hygiene and now getting worried about money. After factoriing out rent, I only have about $400 to spend a month from now until Sept. And half of that is groceries. Hmph. Would be toleration except when I go home on Wed I need to register my car, pay insurance for the year, pay for application to Bangor hygiene school (as backup) and also pay for motorcycle course if I get a spot! AH! Which reminds me, I applied to take a course to get my bike license this summer. I hope they have a spot for me!! But then I'd need a bike!

Which brings me back to my damn car. So it had this weird squeak back home. Took it to the shop. He said it was fixed. Okay. Now I'm here and the same squeak is going on. Doesn't do it when I step on the breaks though and doesn't do it when it's wet. Tony thinks its break pads or hub bearing. I take it to Honda because I know the owner and I know we'll be treated well. And we were! But they told us that they couldn't find anything wrong. Took it for a test drive and couldn't hear the squeak. And they checked the pads, they were fine. Apparently didn't check the hub bearing though because they said it would have made some other noise (forgot what). So I felt better that the car was okay. But then we drove off and it started squeaking REALLY loudly. AND now there is another sound. So there are two simultaneous weird noises at the same time. Forgot what Tony thought the other might be but it sounded expensive. Guys at Honda did mention that the squeak could be because I don't have Mercury break pads and sometimes they don't fit perfectly. So maybe I should look into getting some. But now I have another weird noise. Tony thinks I could easily put $1,000 into my car. *sigh* At least it runs fine. . .for now. 

Anyway, I'll be back in Maine on Wed. Horrah!! Going to Portland for the weekend but then I'll be home for a couple of weeks.

I just saw a commercial that I love. It's a McDonalds commercial and the dad is with his hockey playing daughter (about 9 years old) having a meal:
Girl: Dad, do you ever with I was a boy?
Dad: If you were a boy, who'd I take to Saturday morning practice?
Who'd I teach to go stick side?
Girl: *gives Dad a discouraged look*
Dad: If you were a boy, who'd be my little girl?

Awwwwww!

Cheers"

"event","Since my livejournal posts automatically transfer to facebook, I just want to say HI to any possible new FB reader. I better be careful what I say. My posts are getting very accessible. I'll stop bad-mouthing my classmates behind their backs. ;) Just kidding if any of you are reading this. 

Winding down the semester. It's kind of crazy. I have one week of class left and then one final. I'm done the day after Easter! Then I'm going to get out of Tony's way for a bit (he's in school until the end of May) and spend a weekend in Portland and then go home for a week or two. Whatever I feel like I guess. So if you're in Eastport, Portland OR Orono and want to see me, give me a shout!! I miss everyone. 

Meanwhile, aside from academics, I have to fill out the FAFSA, apply for an off campus work permit, and I'm also applying to the university of bangor's dental hygiene program as a backup incase tragedy strikes and I don't get in here. Which would be unbelievably horrible since I'd get kicked out of the country and someone else would have to live in MY apartment with MY boyfriend and use MY stuff that I chose to leave with him, lol. Anyway, I don't want to leave. I'm happy here. So, it's important. But at any rate, I will apply as a backup. I am SO tired of applying to school's btw. I was thinking the other day that I have sent a whopping FOUR UM transcripts to Dal. Two for dental, one for hygiene, and one as an undergrad. You'd think they'd stop asking after a while but you absolutely have to send a new one with each application, lol. Why do I do this to myself? I think I may secretly like the stress and uncertainty on some level. It's all I've ever known! 
But enough about the bad stuff. . .here's some excitement from last weekend....

Friday the big thing was...Tony bought a data projector! And a 7 ft screen! He'd been talking about it for a while but I was kind of surprised he went through with it. I have to say though, it's really fun for watching a movie on or something during the weekend. We just have to get good speakers for a real movie theater experience! 

Saturday, perhaps the best thing of 2009 so far. . . I had gotten us tickets to the Nova Scotia Symphony does QUEEN music!!!! It was totally not like I was expecting either. I thought it was going to be Queen music sort of incorporated into a symphonic sound, which would have been great! But this was even better! They had a band with them, Jeans N Classics, that go around and perform classic rock with symphonies in order to get younger people interested (although I might have been one of the youngest there!). Anyway, tremendous guitarist, bass player, pianist that sounded just like David Bowie, two female backup singers that do familiar radio jingles, and an awesome female drummer! PLUS, a lead singer (Michael Shotton)! I was against this at first. I'm generally against anyone singing Queen songs. But he did well! And he made it more enjoyable I think. And to top it off, during the second set, they also had a high school chorus! So you had the symphony (the strings REALLY rocked out!!), the band, and the chorus! He also got the audiance doing a lot of clapping and snapping and different beat stuff (radio ga ga, killer queen, we will rock you, etc)
The set list was: First Half-One Vison, A Kind of Magic, The Show Must Go On, Radio Ga Ga, Love of My Life, Another One Bites the Dust, Killer Queen, I Want to Break Free, and Under Pressure. Second Half-We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, Flash, You Take My Breath Away, Who Wants to Live Forever, You're My Best Friend, Somebody to Love, Bohemian Rhapsody. Encore-Fat Bottomed Girls & Too Much Love Will Kill You
Just a great show! Tony enjoyed it too I think. And it gave us an excuse to dress up!

The other bit of fun news is that Monday I got highlights in my hair. Dark red and very subtle. A big step for me since I've NEVER done anything different with my hair before. Hair stylist, Nikki, who was awesome, told me it's addictive and I'll never want to stop! They are pretty damn awesome. I actually wish they were more prominent than they are. Next time! ;)  

I'm outta material! Ciao!"

"event","Interesting weekend I had. Will update soon (hopefully Wed)!

I was reading some government and was reminded of the US/NATO involvement in Kosovo when I was in 7thth grade. I skipped a grade for ""reading"", and the 8th grade class was doing a section on poetry and we had to make poetry books. Anyway, long story short. . .I wrote a poem about what was going on. And. ..I still remember it word for word. It's not the most creative poem ever but I think sometimes simple is better. Anyway, for a 13 year old, I thought it was pretty good! And it pretty much applies to any war, minus the Serb part. There aren't a lot of things I've written that I've been overly proud of, so I thought I'd share! 


(Can't Remember the Title)

Isn't it ironic 
that we're dropping bombs for peace?
Is this really a good way
To get the war to cease?

Start attacking Serbs
The others will just flee
It doesn't really sound
Like an efficient way to me

I guess it will have to do
Until we find out more
On what is really causing
People choosing War"

"event","Hiya. Here's the highlights of the past two weeks. . .

Backtrack to Friday the 13th. That was a fun night! Met up with Tony and others at the cavity. Had a beverage and then proceeded to a Mooseheads game! It was the last game, I believe, of the regular season. They were playing St. John. This would be junior hockey for those of you interested readers. I'd never seen a junior hockey game. It wasn't bad! I haven't been to many games at all this year so it was nice to get back in the hockey spirit! However, a bunch of us were heading to Ahmed's (who lives in our building) for a party so they wanted to leave before the liquor store closed. It was a tie game when we left and we left after overtime and before the shootout! So we missed the best part, but that's okay. We got to the liquor store with about one minute to spare! It also marked Tony and I's first bus ride in Halifax! Took the bus about half a mile but it was quicker than walking/running! 

Party at Ahmed's was fun. Jackie, a future DDS student from Ellsworth was up looking for an apartment for the fall, so he was there. We chatted a bit. I'd met him in Orono a couple of times. I got pretty drunk without drinking much (not sure why, maybe lack of food) and ended up being really sick the next morning. But the good part was, I got to chat with some of Tony's classmates that I hadn't talked to much before and I got inspired to dye my hair! Tony has a classmate who has red highlights in her hair and it makes her look cute and spunky. I decided I need more spunk! She was very encouraging and sweet enough to give me a 25% gift certificate to the place she had her hair done at! So I guess I will be doing that in the next month! Everyone is always telling me to do something different with my hair and I think this will be great because A) It won't take any maintenance and B) I won't be cutting it, which is often asked of me and my hair grows slow so if I didn't like it, I'd be screwed. 

The next day was Pi Day! I have to give props to pi day because it's the best geek holiday ever and apparently it was recognized officially by Congress this year! I'm glad they are doing something useful! LOL :)

This past Tuesday of course was St. Patty's Day! Celebrated my 25% Irish heritage by attending the 1st Annual Flip Cup Challenge, hosted by one of Tony's classmates, Ian. I had never even heard of flip cup so my goal was to just not be the worst one! However, my team ended up in 3rd (out of 5) and I was deemed a ""flip cup ninja."" It was quite the tourney with a whole bracket and everything. So more DDS bonding, and it was a good time. I have to admit, I am anxious to hone my skills!! Oh, and I want to give credit to the amazing trophy that the winning team got!

I guess that is most of the excitement. This weekend so far has been very toned down. Tony was away most of today at school giving tours to interested students. Oh, but yesterday I DID get a marriage proposal from the deaf pirate, Jack, that sits out in front of the liquor store! Tony gave him a tiny bottle of rum and so Jack gave Tony a high five. I gave him a high five too and he proceeded to kiss my hand and ask me to marry him. Caught off guard I replied, ""Uh, maybe later."" And then he laughed heartily in a pirate way. 

In other exciting news, I got tickets to the Nova Scotia Symphony does Queen music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am super excited! In case somebody reading this doesn't know, Queen is my favorite band of all time. Actually . . .I'm pretty sure everyone knows that. Especially in light of my LJ username. 

Got a lot of stuff to do Sunday and Monday. Ugh.

Otherwise classes going well. I've been coming up with some interesting theories of late. Don't want to get into them now. But I love how excited I get after I come back from a philosophy of bio class or a soc class. Although, soc has been annoying me recently. They give no credit to biology whatsoever. Several times I have wanted to raise my hand and say, ""actually, that can be explained in conjunction with this. . ."" but there's no need for me to rain on their parade. I'll try to keep my thoughts within the discipline and thus receive a good grade, lol. 

Live Long and Prosper."

"event","Oh loyal followers, sorry about the delay. This semester is shaping up to be a bit busier than I had first expected! I might even do another update later to expand on some thoughts from this one. 

Okay so first things first. The main cause of my delay was that for the first two or three weeks of January, I didn't feel very well. And then I just got behind and didn't feel updating. I had a really bad cold for most of December. Then all my symptoms miraculously went away but I was left feeling really lightheaded and woozy 100% of the time. I guess I wasn't getting enough oxygen. I was just considering visiting a doctor when a Saturday or two ago, Tony made me lie down for a day and not do anything. That did the trick! Now I am fully recovered!

I love how I made all sorts of notes about things to include and now they are SUCH old news. Okay, so lets see. My life is pretty boring aside from classes. Well, I had a job interview! It was for an ""interviewing"" position. I'd go around with a cameraman and talk to students for surveys and things. Apparently there was only one other applicant. And also apparently I am a total loser because it's been like two weeks and I haven't heard back from them! I think I made a bad impression at the interview as I was nervous and sick and they were looking for someone enthusiastic and full of energy, lol. Too bad too because I wrote a kickass cover letter. Anyway, it was only for $40 a week so it doesn't really matter.

In other news, I have been lifting weights! Yes, you heard me! Weights! I can now bench almost 50% of my body weight! And Tony's got me drinking protein shakes too. I need to start doing some other sort of stuff though. I do some curls and I was doing leg stuff but then I got busy or something and haven't lately. Anyway, we're getting all buff here. 

I got a rejection letter from dentistry the other day. I knew I was going to get it. What bugs me though, is that last year I got it in May. That means I was the first to get cut! It's just not a happy feeling. However, I applied to the hygiene program tonight! I don't think I should have any trouble getting in but I've been encouraged by a friend to meet with someone from hygiene so I think I shall set up an appt. That stuff makes me nervous but I'll just have to suck it up. 

I spent a lot of this past weekend listening to Maine hockey games. I kind of miss it. They aren't so hot this year and got crushed 7-2 at home on Friday against #1 BU, and then came back and tied 2-2 on Saturday. That was pretty cool. Everyone is so negative about them this year. It's not going to get better, since the coach is problem numero uno, but I take pleasure in small victories. 

Speaking of hockey, Tony and I have the week after next off. We aren't going home because Tony has too much to study and I don't want to go alone. But I think I will get tickets for a Moosehead game. That is the junior hockey team here. Tickets are $15 for students! We also will take some time to explore the city. We haven't seen most of it!

This past Friday, Beth and John and their puppy came over. One of the best behaved dogs I've ever had the pleasure of hanging out with! We had a good time. Got pizza, had drinks, etc etc. We don't relax with friends very often so it was really great. I think they were probably here until about 3 am. 

Didn't celebrate V-Day because Tony has two tests Monday and a paper due later in the week. So we are celebrating on Saturday (which is also vacation). I am going to take him out to a nice dinner at Il Mercado, an Italian restaurant. He said he'd buy me whatever I wanted! So we're going to go shopping for motorcycle apparel! I have a nice helmet but I need a leather jacket that fits (mine is second hand and uncomfortable), gloves and boots. I'm excited.

I love Brent Spiner and mom told me that him and Armin Shimmerman (sp) were going to be on an episode of Leverage that Jonathan Frakes was directing. Well, I had never heard of this show before. I watched it online thought and OMG, it's awesome! I seriously recommend it to anybody who likes anything! lol. Really, I liked it that much. It's about a little band of criminals that do good deeds. Kind of a robin hood mentality. I only saw that one episode and tried to watch the first one tonight and the website I got it off of is gone. And the other one I found won't let me watch it because I'm in Canada, lol. I guess I'll have to wait until season 1 comes out on dvd. Anyway, good writing and acting and there was drama and comedy. 

Okay, so I've just written a lot and haven't even gotten to my classes yet! So I think I will save that. There will probably be a heavy political agenda accompanying, lol. I shouldn't say that actually. It's not an agenda, just my personal thoughts. I love that my classes really let me think about stuff. And I've been thinking a lot. So I shall save that! Until then. . .

"event","I know the point of this is to underscore the first African American president. And it IS a huge thing, but I haven't said much of it since that's not why I voted for him. At any rate, since I was a little little kid, I've loved to watch people morph into other people. So, I just really liked this all around!

"event","Ah, what a day!!!!! I'm overwhelmed. I've never really said that I was proud to be American. Not that I haven't been, but I guess I just haven't felt very patriotic the last few years. Yes, I love my country, always, but it's hard to feel ""pride"" when you think its going in the wrong direction and you have no faith in your leaders. But today, I can say with conviction that I feel a lot of pride. I even tried to find a shirt or something with an American flag on it but I realized I don't have any, lol. So I wore my Obama pin on my jacket.

I think everyone should have had the day off, lol. Not just Americans, but everyone! It seems that a lot of classes back home got to watch the swearing in and such. And everyone at work was watching. I went to class but I don't know how I could focus. Even my philosophy professor was stoked. Her cell went off during class, which was apparently someone informing her of where she could watch the inauguration!

I have to say that the facebook/cnn feed was quite a nifty thing. Being sort of isolated in Hali, it helped to feel like I was watching the events unfold with thousands of other excited enthusiastic hopeful men and women from around the world. That was fantastic to see everyone elses thoughts as things happened.

The inauguration: Awesome!!!!! 2 million people, wow! Best parts were Aretha singing America, Cheif Justice Roberts messing up the oath (haha), and Itzhak Perlman and Yo Yo Ma. Oh and Obama's daughters taking pictures. So cute. The poem was really weird and Michelle looked like she was trying hard to figure out what the lady was talking about! Oh and another highlight was referring to GWB as the ""former President."" :) 

Speech: Well the speech was overwhelming. Probably the best speech of my lifetime, that I've heard. He really spoke to everyone and integrated everybody into his speech. Bush got owned a couple times in the speech, not a bad thing. But overall, you could really feel the conviction and meaning in what he was saying. Some of my favorite quote:

""All are equal, all are free""
""...all deserve the chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.""
""We will restore science to its rightful place""
""We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals"" (Take that Bush!)
""People will judge you on what you build, not on what you destroy"" (speaking to world leaders)

Right now, the Obamas just got back in the car after walking down the street for a bit. Pretty brave of them. And I'm enjoying the facebook statuses regarding Michelle walking in her heels, lol. Ah, I love technology. . . sometimes. 


It's a great day. As some civil rights dude said, we've come so far in such a short time. Only in America. 

In sociology, we were talking about Max Weber's views that a charismatic leader will change the world. Since Hitler, that seems to have a negative connotation. And while I know that people get swept up in Obama and he hasn't ""Done anything yet"", the massive amount of hope that he's instilled in so many millions of people all over the world IS something in itself. People actually believe things can change for the better now. That their own lives can change. Of course, his words need to be backed up.I think that if Obama makes good on even a fraction of what he's promised, his presidency will be a success. He certainly has a lot of support, from people of all sides. Someone in class said they watched the speech with cynicism and looking for flaws but was really impressed. 

Quote of the Day:
Jesse: This is a tribute to us, Kathleen! We had to suffer both our entire high school AND college days in a dark political stigma. Here's to turning our spirits for the U.S. around, and having real pride!"

It appears to be a day like any other day. . .

But, it's an extra happy day! 

It also happens to be MLK Day. But not in Canada. However, somewhat ironically, classes were cancelled today. I'm not sure why. I think perhaps flooding? I know some offices were flooded. . . it's like 45 degrees out, the nicest day of the past week by far. And, I didn't have class today anyway! I do have a lot to study though, so I guess I'll get back to it. . .still happy though!"

"event","I wanted to make this a separate post because it's such a big deal. Such a big deal to me in fact that in a heated debate with a friend just now, I got so pissed off that I claimed to, ""Fight to the death,"" for gay marriage. Well, I can't think of a circumstance where that would come in to play but if it ever does, I guess I will stick to my word! lol

Anyway, jokes aside, a heterosexual democratic maine state senator is proposing legislation that would allow for gay marriage is Maine. At first I thought, ""That will never pass in Maine!"" But I also thought it was a good start and would get people thinking. Sometimes you need a few futile attempts before you can make a big change. Nothing wrong with that. But then I started really thinking. Mainers are weird. You never know how they will vote. And one thing I know, is that they don't like the government or anyone else telling them what to do. Also, it's not a religious debate, it's a legal one. There IS a separation of church and state. Therefore, religion should not come into play. Homosexuals should have the same rights as everyone else. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, etc etc. Mainers are nothing if not practical, and I think that reason can possibly prevail. I mean hello, this is what this country was founded on, equality. Took a while for blacks, women, etc...and now for homosexuals, but it'll happen eventually. Anyway, you can't persuade the crazy religious folk, but I think perhaps they are the minority. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. But, yay for Maine and kudos to Mr. Damon.

"event","My break now seems like forever ago! I guess I've been back for almost two weeks now. I think when I left off, I had just gotten home from being in Orono for a few days. There is not a whole lot left to speak of. On Christmas Eve I got to visit with James, Tara and Patrick for a bit. Christmas Eve was a little strange this year because there was no mass at St. Joes. Mom and I had to go to Calais. But at least we went to mass with Doo-Da and Bridget and got to be with family. Christmas was really nice. My grandmother was in good spirits and I think everyone else was. Picked tony up after Christmas. We had Uno and Lois and Tony came for the first time! Jesse won! New Years Eve, Tony and I went to the Rose Garden. Our friend was playing in a band. It was the coldest night of the year, I think, but I managed to run out at 11 to watch the Maple Leaf drop and then again at midnight for the sardine drop. On New Years Day, we went with Dad and Lauren and B and M, and Dennis and Bud and Melinda to the Algonquin. Then we went bowling! I almost kept up with Bud for a bit but then my arm got tired and I started sucking, lol. So that is the shortest recap I can make!

 I do want to point out the coolest Christmas gift I got was from Tony. . .he MADE ME A DIDGERIDOO! I never would have guessed that one! He remembered this summer when I saw a guy playing it in the follies that I said, ""I want one of those!"" and he said, ""I can make you one."" What a sweetheart! It's kind of purple and splotchy. I can't play it yet though. I can't do cyclical breathing. But I will! That should be a new goal for this year.

Okay so then I came back and had to start classes. Last week sucked because I have had a cold for a month now. I thought it was going away but it actually got worse! Like. . .I was coughing all the time, I couldn't breathe at all through my nose, my throat hurt, I was all sneezy and stuff. . .it just sucked. Now, going on my 5th week with this damn virus, it's almost gone. Just some remnants of coughing and stuffiness. So classes. . .

This semester is going to be VERY interesting in terms of classes. Very small classes and quite a different type than I am used to. No science classes, so I'll have to be using the other half my brain, long stagnant! Actually, I like to think I use the right side a lot, just not in an academic capacity. Anywho, it's also fundamentally different as far as I will be doing a lot of reading and writing with less emphasis on exams. And lots and lots of creative thinking. I'm only taking three so here's a summary:

American Government: Taking this for an easy A. Plus I think taking it in Canada should be interesting. It only meets once a week (for three hours), so we've only gone over the constitution so far. My prof is crazy as hell and is apparently in love with Hamilton and Madison. At the beginning of each class, somebody has to recap the weeks events in American political news. I volunteered for this coming week because of the inauguration. Due to my strong feelings and obvious bias, I will probably have to go back on my word to not draw attention to myself by announcing that I am indeed, from ""the states."" 

Philosophy of Biology: Oh this class. If there was ever a class to test my patience, it may be this. It's half bio students and have phil students, which I think makes it very unique. But, the class run by a philosopher you self-professed that she, ""doesn't care about facts."" So we've been focused entirely on adaptations and natural selection. I won't go into detail but she DOES bring up some interesting points. For better or worse, my infatuation with Mr. Darwin has made somewhat close-minded to her points. But I am paying close attention so that I can come up with counter points, lol. It's a fun class, really! We have 5 short essays to write throughout the semester, on the different readings (so far we've read Dawkins, Gould, etc), and 3 exams in which we get the questions ahead of time. If it's true that the only way to get an A in a philosophy class is to suck up the teacher, I am doomed! lol

Contemporary Social Theory: This one worries me slightly. I needed a soc class and this one had spots open. I didn't realize that it had spots open because people know that theory classes are hard!! Oh well. There are two majors papers that need to be written, no exams, and a presentation. I have already chosen the week to do mine. I chose a post-Marx (or something) week. Not because I love Marx so much but because it is very soon and I wanted to get it over with quickly! The professor seems funky.

I am also going to attempt to get a job on campus. There are limited options though, it seems. 

In OTHER news. . .I am lifting weights! I am benching 40 pounds right now, lol. Sounds wimpy but that's over 1/3 of my body weight! I am doing leg curls with 60.

It was FREEZING today! I decided to finally explore the tunnel on campus. I didn't get as far as I wanted to in it though. I meant to go all the way to the library and apparently came out somewhere between the life science building as the library. I will make another attempt on Tuesday! I should have just followed the signs instead of the crowd. Duh.

Watched CSI tonight. Cried at the end.

"event","So I was just telling a friend about a really weird dream I had. And after I told him, it sounded even stranger. So I still need to make a real update soon but for now. . .here's a synopsis of my strange dream!

Jimmy Carter died, and there was a funeral procession in Eastport with his casket. And Jesse was involved somehow. But I missed seeing it. I had wanted to take a picture. I ran after it with another friend but we couldn't catch up with it. So I got Jesse to take me to where it was being stored and I saw the cart it was being pulled on, but no casket. I said, ""Where is it?"" And Jesse said it was hidden under the floorboards! So he started pulling it all up and then took out a skeleton (as if Carter had been dead for a long time). And then the new president who seemed more like a king than a president (a fictional person) came and got really mad. But I think I got my picture!"

"event","Greetings! I've been on break and apparently that means a break from blogging too! Before I make a separate post regarding my break, I would like to recap some highlights from the previous year and also list out some of my goals and plans for 2009. I don't like to use ""New Years Resolutions"" because it seems a bit shallow to me. If you really wanted to do something, why wait until Jan 1? Basically everything on my list is something that either I didn't have the opportunity to do earlier or that has been ongoing. 

2008 Monthly Highlights:

January: Crazy New Years in Boston with Jesse, Jonatan, James, etc. 

February: Saw Obama in Bangor!

March: Spring break with Tony in Boston. Tour of the USS Constitution and visit to the science museum

April: Tony and I installed a light in the kitchen for my mom

May: GRADUATED FROM UM!!!!! The most significant event of the year.

June: Moved down to Medford in mid-May and was fully immersed in Medford life by June. I think this was also the month of the Celtics victory. One of the highlights of the summer for sure.

July: Home for the 4th! I never actually wrote about this because I forgot. But since I didn't have to work, I had one of the best 4ths of my life. Spent a lot of time with friends, had some fun drinking down at the cannery with James and Tony, we both helped out at the 4th Annual Moose Island Follies (Tony did an awesome job at spotlights), and watched the fireworks from Bernie's sailboat in the bay!

August: Moved to Halifax with Tony and got ready to start school at Dal!! The most exciting thing of the year. 

September: Not many highlights this year. Awful start to the semester. 

October: Mom and Caitlyn came to visit!

November: Barack Obama elected the 44th President of the United States! The most significant national event of the year.

December: I turned 23, went to a Maine hockey game, changed my career plans, and made peace with the previous semester. 


10 Goals and Plans for 2009 (I can't believe it's '09 already!) in no particular order:

1.) Keep learning guitar
2.) Do yoga consistently
3.) Put more effort into things (Related to the previous two!)
4.) Read more books
5.) Explore Halifax
6.) Meet people in Halifax
7.) Clean the apartment occasionally
8.) Improve aspects of my behavior and personality that need improving 
9.) Apply, be accepted (I hope) and start dental hygiene
10.) Take the course and get my motorcycle license
11.) Weight Training"

Mom woke me up at 7:30 and said, ""Sorry, you have to get up, there's an emergency."" I said, ""Whaaaaaat?"" And she told me that there was no heat and the house was down to 49 degrees!! I had to shovel a path from the driveway to the basement (with a wall of snow in front of the door) for the heating guy. So I hopped up and put some clothes on and spent a half hour shoveling a path for Richard. Then upon mom's request, dug the rest of her car out (someone had already plowed most of the snow away). I went back to bed and got under 5 blankets and was still shivering an hour later!
But there is a somewhat happy ending. We have heat now. . .apparently there is a vent on the side of the house and it was covered in snow or something. An easy fix. But I didn't wake up again until 2:30! Now its almost 4 and I think I'll go take a nice warm shower!"

"event","Before I get to the really exciting news of returning to Maine, I must comment on the Iraqi guy throwing his shoes at Bush. And this is my comment: HAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Also, Bush sure dodged them well. Jesse and I think he's been practicing :) 

Also, a few more notes about school. I have decided to take three classes, keeping my health care ethics class. I think that if I'm only part time, I won't receive my Stafford Loan. So what the heck. I'll keep that class, and take gov and soc and that'll be good. Found out some good and bad grade news today. Found out that I did in fact get a D in nucleic acids (poo). But also, I got a 29 out of 30 on my big paper for health psych. The one that I did yoga for three weeks for. My TA commented all over my paper and then sent it back. She loved it. 

So now to the good stuff! I'm home! The trek started Friday afternoon around 4:00. We got a few calls in the morning, while Tony was taking a final, warning us about the weather. If you don't recall, there was an ice storm or something. But anyway, I checked online and it looked like it was going to clear up as the day went on so I figured by the time we got close to Maine, it would be over. So we left a little after 4 but it took over an hour to get to Dartmouth (which is less than a mile away, over a bridge) because the lights were out there and the traffic was all backed up. I started driving on a very dark highway in the rain and some fog on an unfamiliar road and was freaking out. After about an hour of not being able to see anything but the white line in the middle of the road, I let Tony drive. We stopped at a Tim Hortons in some random remote location and then I took over again for the rest of the trip. Weather was good from that point on and spent about one minute at the border. From Houlton to Orono, we only saw one car on the road. The trip took 7.5 hours, which is a half hour shorter than if we'd gone through Calais and route 9. However, it was intensely boring and felt longer. Not to mention, there was NOWHERE to stop....so it's a good thing that we didn't have to. I don't think we'll go that route again. 

Anyway, we arrived about midnight (remember, the clocked went back an hour) and I kissed the ground in Orono in front of Tony's parents house. I could not have been happier. And so relaxed too. It took Tony a couple days to relax though, and catch up on sleep. I think he's still doing that. But after a couple days, his breathing returned to normal!
Anyway, it was a good weekend. His mom made meatloaf for us because we'd been craving it. And his dad made me a blueberry pie to bring home. I finished my Christmas shopping and did some errands on campus (friggin UM...I wanted Cutler to send my medical records to the health center in Eastport but the lady was giving me a hard time because she'd never heard of it). I also visited with Emily and went to a HOCKEY game!!!!!!!!! Tony and I went to see the new Bond film (pretty good) and The Day The Earth Stood Still (watch the original not the new one!). 

Today I came home! I have very little to do in the next two weeks. It should be relaxing. I will try not to be bored. Jesse will be home right before Christmas and I'll pick Tony up from Orono and bring him to Eastport on the 27th.

"event","I had my meeting with Nancy this morning. It was very productive. She seemed genuinely sorry to hear about my rough semester. I'll spare you the details, but apparently the biochem course, and taking another is irrelevant. That's the second thing they look at after overall gpa. And at least three people form Maine have better grades than me right now. That doesn't actually sound like a lot of competition, which made me feel like ""oh darn I missed my chance,""  but that's that. She said that I've dug myself in a hole, because of a couple C's last year,and in order to make up for this semester, I'd have to do THREE MORE SEMESTERS! I said I couldn't financially afford to do that. She said as it was right now, I'd have ""nil"" chance of getting it. Then she asked me what I was going to do. I asked her about hygiene. We talked about how I met all the requirements and had good enough grades, I just had to have one more semester of soc. She thought I wouldn't have much competition. She warned me though, and this was good to know, that hygiene apparently is not a stepping stone to dentistry. She said that hygiene classes are looked at as intro level classes and that basically everyone does very very well in them. She said that they would still consider the last 60 undergrad credit hours, should I reapply. So she wanted to make sure I knew that I was really making a career choice here. She also mentioned that I am very young compared to most accepted dds students. She said pretty much everyone in Tony's class is older than me. She said it takes a lot of luck to get accepted, the stars have to be aligned right, or something odd like that, and that it wasn't for me right now. She expressed her dissatisfaction with the way it was. She said she supposes sometimes maturity and time and life experience is needed sometimes....and that if further down the road I took some more classes, I might be able to get in, if I still wanted to. So we decided that I would apply and just take soc next semester. I will also keep the American government course that I signed up for incase I end up with a D this semester. An A will even it out. They want a B+ average or something. So two classes and I can get an on campus job. Anyway, that's the plan. It is do-ab and I am coming to terms with it and making peace with the situation. This is not the end of my life! As she said, I'm 23. I don't know what the future holds. But most likely I'll start hygiene in the fall and be done by age 25. If I did hygiene for 10 years, I'd still only be 35! Plenty of time to go back, if I felt like it. Anyway, everyone likes their hygienists and everyone hates their dentist right? lol. Also, it's listed as one of the top growing jobs in the country. You have flexible hours and make a decent amount of money. National average is 45k but it can be a lot more than that depending on where you work and how much you work. So let me just say this...it is a big relief. I am glad that all that mess is over with and that next semester should be fun and relaxing. I am not jumping for joy. . .but I'm relaxed, which I have not been for a long time."

"event","There was a meme on facebook where you had to write 16 facts, goals, shortcomings or habits about yourself and tag 16 friends. Then they had to do it. But you also had to write what you tagged them. Well, I'm not going to bother with that on livejournal and nobody needs to do this! I just felt like I made a damn good list to that I'd share it with my facebook audience as well. Although, I can only think of two people off the top of my head, maybe three, that read my LJ and don't have facebook! So. . .this is just exactly as written, copy and pasted

1.) When I make hamburgers the meet falls apart but is always cooked perfectly!
2.) Regular normal people generally don't take much of an interest in me

4.) A friend and I are going to submit an Audition tape to the Amazing Race, because we've wanted to since high school!
5.) Printers don't seem to work very long for me. I went through three, maybe four, at Umaine
6.) I used to have an ocd behavior where I would save all of the pages of a day-by-day calendar but I am weaning myself off it
7.) I still save almost all of my emails. I have over 10,000 in my yahoo account, dating back years

11.) I wish that communism actually worked
12.) I prefer gourmet brick-oven thin-crust pizza over greasy deli pizza

"event","So Monday was my last final. It was health psychology. 91 multiple choice questions. Not too bad. I had about 30 questions that I narrowed down to two answers. So I should end up with at least a B on the final and an A or B in the class. I still don't know what I got on my yoga paper. 

So, I have a meeting at 9am Friday Thursday (today!) with Nancy Webb, who is the manager of academic affairs in dentistry. I guess I will find out what is going to happen me! I will find out if taking another biochem course next semester will make any difference or if I've just totally blown my opportunity as I feel I have. Then I will find out if I have a chance at dental hygiene. If so, I'll apply. If not, I guess I will withdraw from classes and figure out something else. I should also find out if I am to apply for hygiene, if I need to take classes or not anyway. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking about what went wrong. I mean, I had a plan and it seemed so good. Take four classes, study all the time, get A's, get into school. Obviously, I do have to blame myself for getting behind in studying in the beginning. Tsk Tsk. It is never possible to completely catch up, unfortunately. However, I have also decided I am not really a details person. I focused my studying the wrong material consistently. For example, in the first immune test that I failed, I had no idea he was going to ask for the details of a pathway. I NEVER had a question like that at UM, so I focused more on facts, which is what I'm used to. The second test that I got an A+ on, was written by another professor and had easier material, I feel. The final was written mostly by prof #1, so I tried to study all the details of the pathways to be ready. Of course, he didn't ask any. I should have spent more time studying the general stuff. Also, I don't think ANYTHING organic or inorganic is more complex than the immune system. If something is, I'd like to know about it. Only immunologists need to know the level of detail I was subjected to! 

Nucleic Acids was similar, test-wise, I think. Also, because of the weirdness of the notes and the fact the profs would always say, ""but you don't need to know that,"" I never really knew what to expect. So, due in part to a bad beginning and in part to ineffective studying, I am now in a crummy situation.

I'm not sure if the focus on random details here, instead of a comprehensive focus on the important concepts, is meant to weed out students (bad) or to make sure the students really know everything (good). If I could go back and do it again, I guess I would make sure I knew EVERYTHING. Seems obvious anyway but sometimes you have to budget your time. Also, with the exception of nucleic acids, I managed to get an A in at least one of my tests for my other three courses. Which means that I DO have the ability. I don't know if I should be happy about that or not!

Again, I cannot change the past. I'm disappointdd and frustrated, but it's out of my hands. I am trying to remember that sometimes it just takes people a while and my dreams might not be totally crushed. Heck, Tony is going to graduate at the age of 46! I've got time! Plus, I think at least half of Tony's class is my age or older. 
I would like to make it perfectly clear that I have NO regrets at all about deciding to come here and take classes. It was a good experience and I needed to give it a shot. And even if those classes amount to nothing, they SAY that education is never a waste. So I will take ""their"" word for it. Gonna roll with it. 

After my immunology final on Saturday, I was a bit disappointed. All my hard finals were done. I wanted to be relieved. I haven't felt the joy of relief and sanctification and pure joy at being done with finals since my freshman, maybe sophomore year at UM. I miss that. Instead, I get to just look forward to going home and a respite but without the satisfaction of accomplishment. I decided that I needed an infusion of Christmas cheer. I went to a a cafe called, ""Just Us"" that serves mostly hot beverages. It was cozy and there was Christmas music playing. I got a chai and just sat there for 20 minutes and I also got one to go for Tony. I think it was good for my soul. Also, I got hit on by two guys. There were typical interesting tea drinking bohemian cafe type guys. I think that might be a key to why I haven't made more friends here though. Everyone here is very nice but very reserved. I usually attract what my dad calls ""fringe"" people. I will at least say, the interesting people!

I talked to Tara online when I got back. We had a very productive conversation. She is going to be my role model I think. I told her how I was scared that I'd have to just go find a job and whatnot. And the thing with Tara is, her and Mark just make enough to eat and pay the bills, but they are SO HAPPY! They love each other and she loves her job. And she sounds like the happiest that I've ever heard her! And that's what it's all about. Do what makes you happy and make sure you have enough food to eat, lol. So, if I have to go find work, I'm going to make sure it's something interesting that I enjoy and something where I can help people (a major priority). Granted, I might have to 'settle' at first. But if I HAVE to make a long term commitment, or a career out of a job, it's damn well going to be enjoyable and useful to humanity. Much more important than money. I don't know anyone making a ton of money happier than that girl! I shall live the life I choose.

That was my thought process then. . .

The next day, I knowing how badly I goofed up, I had a mini identity crisis. I didn't feel like I knew my place in the universe. I have had the same goal for 16 years of my life, and now what? I had sort of defined myself as the girl that was going to be a dentist. Now I have to search for meaning and purpose in my life. I started talking to Jesse, who felt the same way. He was always the musician but now is not sure he can make a career out of music. So we commiserated about that and about how we never had to study until college and we were never pushed. Although he feels as if we were pushed to go right from high school to college, I don't think I quite felt that way. But I do think I may be a bit burnt out at the moment. We also discussed how nobody ever ever EVER told me that maybe I should come up with a backup plan. Or maybe I should explore other options or keep an open mind. I was always the smart kid and everyone assumed I'd be a dentist. Granted, about mid-way through college my dad started pushing me towards other healthcare things that I am only mildly interested in (if that). But that's it. Even now, people are saying, ""Oh don't worry, you're smart. You'll get there."" I really just want to say, ""No! I'm a loser!"" Granted, I know that's not true but I don't know how else to get it through their heads that being smart and motivated isn't always enough. I think I'm still in a little bit of identity crisis mode. But trying to phase out. 

THEN, I started talking to William. We got talking about conspiracy theories and the alien structures on the dark side of the moon. In the end he decided none of it matters because we're all going to die in 2012. I prefer to think, though, that if anything happens in 2012, it will be spiritual awakening, as some have predicted. At any rate, I have recently begone studying esoteric and metaphysical and Buddhist things more comprehensively, and it makes me feel a lot better about my lot in life. I like that there is so much that we don't know and understand in the world and there are certainly matters of far greater importance than if I get into professional school or not!

Anyway, I started feeling better until LAST night. Wait, last night was my birthday, maybe the night before. I started looking at jobsinme.com. I realized that I wasn't qualified for ANY of them. I probably checked about 60. The main criteria was always experience. Usually 5 years or more. So great. . .what does a degree get me? Nothing, absolutely nothing. 

That was my train of thought for the past few days. Now where am I at? Well Tony made me feel better when he said that he'll be making a lot of money in a few years so I can just work for fun as supplementary income. I'm sure you're all thinking, ""What if you're not with Tony then?"" Well regardless, I don't like that idea. I want to be a big contributor and I want to reach my full potential. So. . .I hope to hear in about 7 hours that I have a good shot at hygiene. And who knows, maybe after two years of hygiene, they'll take me into dentistry. 
I'll let you know how it goes.

And to celebrate my birthday, I'm going to go Christmas shopping! lol. Not that I can afford much, but I'll pick up a few nice Halifax souvenirs. I opened up my gift from mom and it was a sweatshirt that says ""Gaelic & Garlic"" with little Irish and Italian flags. I picked it out of a magazine once. I'm wearing it now. Yesterday Tony asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I said he didn't have to get me anything because he doesn't have time, but he could take me to dinner! Since he has two finals tomorrow (and 7 in 5 days) we went out to dinner last night (well, just a few hours) to Trinity, which is connected to Park Victoria. I had Vietnamese spring rolls for an app and maple curry chicken pasta for dinner with a cosmo! And mousse for dessert! If that doesn't sound eclectic enough, the BEST thing, was Tony's maple squash soup. It was one of the best soup's I've ever tried, for sure, and Tony described it as ""to die for.""
Anyway, I'm hopefully also setting up a meeting with Nancy Webb today to talk about what I should be doing next semester and whatnot.

"event","So I somehow really messed up my sleep schedule. It's almost 5 am and I haven't been able to fall asleep and I have a test in immunology later in the day. This has been happening lately. I'd attributed it to caffine but I didn't have any tea since about 8 I think. Anyway, I studied all day and yesterday but I still don't know anything because it's so complex. It's just a lot of memorization and it's like memorizing sanskrit or something completely foreign. Anyhoo. . .I was trying to sleep just now but the fire alarm went off for the 2nd time today (I guess technically the first time today) and 3rd time in two/three days. The thing is stupid sounding and Tony slept right through it. Beth didn't hear it yesterday and it was in the middle of the afternoon! Anyway, it went for about 15 minutes, I think probably most of the building slept through. Not sure what's up with the thing but if somebody is pulling the alarm, they should be butchered. 
I guess I could study a bit before trying to sleep again. This semester has turned into crap, lol. I've had like three dental students tell me that dental school sucks anyway. haha. I'm not sure if that makes me feel better or not. . .

Meanwhile, the worst part about not getting into dental school is that, if I am not in hygiene school either, I will have to look for a real job that pays enough money to pay back loans and live. And I can't stay here because I can't work in Canada. I can't go home because there are no jobs. That leaves a total mystery destination with a total mystery job.

Scott and I were in the midst of breaking up, I had like four guys chasing after me, and I was spending most of my time retreating from that mess with Tony. Every evening I would end up in Rachel's room, commiserating over guys and life. And, of course, I was really stressed about finals. I guess SOME things never change. I can't even believe that was a year ago. Look what has happened in a year: I graduated and got a degree, I spent the good part of a summer poor and jobless in Boston with Jesse, and then I moved to a new country, went to a new school and moved in with Tony. WOAH! How was there time for all that? Fastest year ever!
Also, I remember that last year I never got to get into the Christmas spirit until about Christmas Eve because we had finals up until the last second. This year will be different. I'll be done with finals in less than a week and then I am going to start in with Christmas cheer early! Here's hoping my finals permit it. . ."

"event","First off, I would like to dispel a myth about Canada as a whole. Not all of Canada is covered under a mound of snow and not all Canadians deal with it effectively and live in peace with it. They may live in peace with the snow, but it's more out of apathy than efficiency.
Let me explain. I was told when I got there that Halifax does not get a lot of snow. There will be snow but then it will rain and be gone. Somewhat disappointing to hear because I love snow! I don't like cold and ice but snow is fun to play in and very pretty to watch fall. I just enjoy trudging through snow and throwing it at people and admiring the beauty of a street lined with snowey houses. Anyway, everyone was very excited yesterday because the expected forecast was a storm that would dump about 30 centimeters (approx. a foot) of snow on the city. I was somewhat excited about this. So. . .I wake up, look out, and see not a blizzard, but lightly falling snow with what appears to be a little over half a foot accumulation. And I have just been informed by a friend from Austria, who has spent much time in western Canada, that it's the same way. All talk for very little snow.
So that is the disappointing part, that the blizzard is barely a dusting. But that is not the really disheartening part. For very little snow, you would expect it to be dealt with efficiently. But that was not the case. There was a guy driving a tractor plow type thing on the sidewalk trying to remove the snow instead of using a snow blower. It was taking forever. And pedestrians were not even getting out of the way. The roads, which in Maine, would have been dealt with overnight and totally bare, still had snow on them. I have not seen or heard an actual plow since I got up. And there were morons still trying to park on the side of the road and having trouble getting their cars over the little mounds of snow. Not only was this an odd sight to behold, but if snow removal was so sucky back home, people would be at city hall screaming, or, removing it themselves the old fashioned way. But, people here are too laid back to care. 
Now you are probably thinking two things. One, that you thought I really liked Halifax and the people. And two, that I am getting all upset over a little bit of snow on the sidewalk and that I must be going crazy. This is not the case. I DO love Halifax and the people. And I'm not annoyed about the sidewalks, at home, you DON'T walk on them in winter, you walk in the street. But this is a city and people don't have that luxury. It's not about the sidewalks . . .it's about this not being ""home"".
Say what you want about Mainers. . .they may have their faults but they are very good at many practical things, including dealing with snow. Maine may have a lot of stubborn, overweight, conservative hicks but the same people are also the most hard-working, independent and loyal people you will find anywhere. Basically, I'm not annoyed that the blizzard is a dusting, I just miss home and the locals. Oddly enough though, I don't really miss the US or Eastport, but just Maine as a whole. It was the same way when I spent the summer in Boston (granted, I couldn't really miss the US. . .). Anyway, I will be home in about three weeks and for now, I guess I will just enjoy watching the snow fall and the mini-snow man that Tony made on the balcony.

And last night there was a shooting (granted, it wasn't random, it was retaliation) pretty much across the street. 
And now I have to go walk in the snow/rain/wind/dark to tutorial. Blech. I'd rather just curl up with a cup of tea and write a paper. . ."

>  
>
> In the first two weeks since the election, President-elect Barack Obama has broken with a tradition established over the past eight years through his controversial use of complete sentences, political observers say.
>
> Millions of Americans who watched Mr. Obama's appearance on CBS' ""Sixty Minutes"" on Sunday witnessed the president-elect's unorthodox verbal tick, which had Mr. Obama employing grammatically correct sentences virtually every time he opened his mouth.
>
> But Mr. Obama's decision to use complete sentences in his public pronouncements carries with it certain risks, since after the last eight years many Americans may find his odd speaking style jarring.
>
> According to presidential historian Davis Logsdon of the University of Minnesota, some Americans might find it ""alienating"" to have a President who speaks English as if it were his first language.
>
> ""Every time Obama opens his mouth, his subjects and verbs are in agreement,"" says Mr. Logsdon.  ""If he keeps it up, he is running the risk of sounding like an elitist.""
>
> The historian said that if Mr. Obama insists on using complete sentences in his speeches, the public may find itself saying, ""Okay, subject, predicate, subject predicate - we get it, stop showing off.""
>
> The President-elect's stubborn insistence on using complete sentences has already attracted a rebuke from one of his harshest critics, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.
>
> ""Talking with complete sentences there and also too talking in a way that ordinary Americans like Joe the Plumber and Tito the Builder can't really do there, I think needing to do that isn't tapping into what Americans are needing also,"" she said."

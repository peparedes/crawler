work is getting so horrible. on saturday i have to work a 8 hour shift but it actually is 9 hours and they give you an hour lunch break. what am i going to do in a hour? sry i dont each lunch in a hour. actually the hour might be for lunch and dinner since im working till 9. this guy tried to give me a tip the other day and if you take a tip from somebody then you could get fired because there are cameras everywhere. so now they know that me and parker like hide in the cooler for lunch. i want to see the cameras and see what really goes done in the store. the camera people have a lot of power. ;) i started doing the cashier, still having problems though. i dont know where the key is to type in the exact amount that they give you. because its a cashier ment for food everything is complicated and when you need to ring up flowers you just hope it doesnt ring up as bananas. the manager is like ok make sure there isn't shrink! but im excited because i worked sunday and monday so i got 12 dollars an hour. between those two days i got 120. HEHEHE
the birthday party was awesome.. good times good times. so now whenever i look at blair's hair im going to think of bop-it. water balloon fight was great and that creepy kid that ran out of the woods was crazy. i dont think they ever came back for the crushed flower i left on the swing. 
i actually managed to get nicole to go to captains. which nobody came too! so if she hadn't have come i would have been in trouble.

And i'm still waiting for the pictures and conversations, english good times, good times. Speaking of classes, today we got our interms and we had conferences. I did good got all H's except for history where i got a G's. Not to shabby. So i'm pissed off at a certain someone who is purposely being mean, just to piss me off, which is working. But that makes me realize that he is that certain type of person that would do that and that's not cool. So i decided to boycott him for at least a week, see what happens. And yesterday i ran by myself in the woods which i didn't realize had like 10 inches of snow on the ground! So i was all alone in the woods by myself and it was really creepy. LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS O MY! And on tuesday my dad comes in at 9:30 and tells me and my sister that we were laughing to loud so we had to go to bed. So i missed the ending of like the best episode of ONE TREE HILL ever. Never fear i can watch it on sunday. And tennis is coming up and that's always a lot of fun. Karen, christine, and meg always make the season a blast. That's how i got the nickname K-BALL, long story...

"event","hey today i went with blair to the BC basketball game. Which is funny because blair hates basketball. Every two seconds she would ask what time is it. There were these little girls in the seats behind us who kepted on screaming in her ear. She was like kaitlyn i bet i can take them. They kepted on screaming Cookie or whatever. After getting soda on my jeans overall it was fun. Then i had a basketball game which we lost pretty badly, but half our team wasn't there so its ok. We dont dwell on things."

"event","Sorry for not writing in awhile. I've been really busy, and alot has been going on. Work sucks, school sucks, relationships suck. Im not even sure of anything anymore.

Went to a party a few nights back, that proved to be a bad bad idea. I left feeling nothing but confused. Im glad i didnt drink because itd be awhole lot worse. Some of my friends really screwed me over and proved that they never were my friends. Im so tired of being betrayed by the same people. Maybe im to forgiving. everytime they do something like this they say Im sorry Im sorry, your my best friend, and i feel bad and forgive them. Im SO tired of it.

Dereks been calling. Ive been contemplating whether or not to answer for the past few days. Its so hard not to have him around, we were perfect for each other. I would love to have him there for me like he used to be, but its just not the same. When im around him it just feels different. i dont know.

Things have just been really really hard lately."

"event","Today sucked. Me and Cody got in a fight at lunch. I really didn't mean for it to happen. It was really stupid, and I ended up apologizing at the end of the day anyways. 

I told Steve I can't be with him. I'm not over Derek yet, and I can't rush into something only to have it come crashing down on me. I feel really bad, he seemed upset, but there's nothing else I can do. I'm tired of him rushing me into this.

Thanks Aly for trying to cheer me up today <3

On a lighter note, Linds and I went to the mall. Got some wristbands and a couple shirts. 

Took some new pictures today. I'll post some later today or tomorrow."

"event","Hung out with Shannon today. I love that girl more than you can ever imagine. We went to the music store and picked up a few CDs. We saw Brian and Jon there, but they were on their way out so we just said hi and bye.

I really am starting to like Steve, but I dunno if im ready to get into a new relationship after me and dereks past. I feel vulnerable and i dont know if i have the emotional stability for a new relationship. Today he said hes tired of waiting for me, and he just wants to be together. Im not sure what im going to do yet, i told him i needed time. I thought he would give me some, but a couple days is not nearly enough. 

Well im out, i have to go get the car checked out ^_^"

I don't know what's wrong with me but guys don't seem to like me anymore. I am not going back to school to get my diploma, I am probably going to wait a while and go to a comunity college. I am probably moving to Vancover WA as soon as my transfer comes in for work. Oh yeah, I work at Check Into Cash now. Well, I better go cause I have work in the morning. If anyone still uses this, leave me a note.

I have been hanging out with Chris (Oliver, my ex's, roomate) and I had started to like him a little bit. He kept on telling me that he wanted to talk to me about something but he was too chickenshit to tell me. Then the other night I was over at his house and he kissed me. That was what he wanted to talk to me about. I had brought Renee with me to meet everyone and everything was going great. Renee and I had been hanging out in Chris's room and I told Chris by and I told Renee to get her stuff and lets go. I walked into the living room and sayed bye to everyone and then I saw that Renee hadn't followed me so I went back into Chris's room and found her on his bed. Then she rolled on top of him. I thought she was just playing around so I said ""get your stuff lets go"" then I walked out of the room. She still wasn't following me so I went back in there and she was still on top of him. I got pissed and told her if she didn't come right then that I was leaving her. God, she pissed me off so bad! Then I drove her home in silence and went home. Chris had called me so I called him back and we got in a fight. I don't really want to go on about that right now but I called him yesterday before school and left a message telling him that I may ahve overreacted and to call me so we can talk things out. He didn't call me last night and I went to hang out with Oliver last night and by the time I had gotten to his house, Chris was already asleep so I couldn't really talk to him. I am going to give him a call right after school and hopefully we can talk. I will update you guys on what happens with that. I also have to make a doctors appt. after school to finaly get checked to see if I have an ulcer. Well,&nbsp;I guess I am going to go. HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEAH!!!

After prom we went to Jon Miles house and hung out with him, Scooter, Sanchez, Eric Bade, Josey, and I think there might be a couple of other people that I am forgetting about. Anyways, that was fun too! We did a little bit of drinking and Eric and Jon did a little air guitar and singing for Sara and I and then Jon put on my dress and tiara and walked around the house. I had a good time and I can't wait to see what the pictures look like. Well anyways, Oliver and I talked. We both ended up crying and he told me that he still had feelings for me he just doesn't know what he wants right now. I don't know if that means that there is still a chance with him or not. I know that I should just forget him but I really do care for him and I really want to be with him. Last night Jon asked if we could date. I told him no and that Oliver and I just broke up and I'm not over him and that another reason is that him and his girlfriend just broke up because he cheated on her with Oliver's sister. I don't think that I could really ever trust him cause of knowing that. Plus, I'm not really all that attracted to him. Well, I think that I am going to go. Please leave me notes!!!!

"event","The Websters Dictionary Discribes euthanasia as "" the act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly sick or injured individuals in a relatively painless way for reasons of mercy."" In other words, putting people out of their missory, which is what they would be going through.
	On youdebate.com a poll was taken, the question was ""Should euthanasia be leagal?""61% said yes. On another poll by National Opinion Polls, 79% said that they should change the laws to allow euthanasia to be legal. Around the world, other countries are for euthanasia too. The Dutch parlement legalized euthanasia in April of 2001. Polls showed that 90% of the 
public are for euthanasia.
	If someone is suffering and wants to die, they should be allowed to die. Who really wants to live when they have to go through so much pain and suffering. It is more humane to let the person die rather than make them live and have to go through torture. On top of that it must be really hard to keep on living if you know that you are going to die. If I knew that I was going 
to die, I would rather just get it over with than to keep on living in agony. 
	Other people have the arugument that what if the person can't communicate. Well, that also goes with the fact that they are being tortured. They have to go on day by day without the ability to communicate how much pain they are in. There is also the factor that people who are terminal are going to die in the end. The people that are having to take care of them are also having to pay for them to stay in hospitals and take so much of their time taking care of the person. It may be a selfish way to look at things, but it is also rational and reality. 
	Technically there are two types of Euthanasia. Voluntary and Involuntary. Voluntary is when the person gives rational, persistant, and voluntary consent. Involuntary is when the person is unable to communicate to let people know their wishes. I am for both of them. I think that is 
should be up to the main care giver to decide whether the person is suffering enough to die in the situation of involuntary euthanasia. That person should know the person well enough to know their wishes.
	A way to help this problem with whether euthanasia is wanted or unwanted would be to make it so that when you are an adult, it would be manditory to make a living will stating whetheror not you would like to have euthanasia performed if you are unable to communicate. Of courseyour opinion may change so it should be allowed to be changed at any point in time.
	In all, I think that Euthanasia should be permitted whether is it voluntary or involuntary. Keep in mind that you are helping someone to end the suffering that they are going through. Thank you!"

Anyway, so this chick, Jenny told Oli that she loved him when she found out that Oli and I were together and she is totaly trying to get him. I'm not worring though, I know that he wants to be with me so there isn't any compition there. Well, I should get going and do some work or something."

Brittany and Sarah and Megan and Shelly all were there although, Brittany left early to hang out with Ian and didn't call me back later like she said she was going to, *Eh Hem* Anyways, My mom picked me up from there at around 3 and then the next day we had another birthday party at my house for close family and friends. That was fun, My sis kept on making me take shots with her. I was hoping that I was going to be able to get my licens this spring break but it looks like I am only going to be able to take the written and I will have to take the drive test after break.

Next, I have a horrible sun burn on my upper half of my body. I was stupid and went into the tannign bed for 10 min. and got burned all over my stomach, back, and boobs :( it hurts pretty bad and itches like crazy. My birthday is on Saterday and I am excited. I think for once I am going to have a good birthday. I decided since I don't have the time to make my dress, I am going to go get one from like a second hand store and then alter it to how I want it. I need to have soemthing unique though. Jason (my boyfreind) and I had our talk. I think things are going to be ok as long as the things that we talked about actually happen. The other Jason, though, is fucking up. I don't know what the hell happened to him. He had a sudden personality change and is doing a lot of things that, well, lets just say he shouldn't be doing. I don't know what to do. If I can't get him straightened out again I think I am going to have to call his parents and have them talk to him. I would rather him be pissed at me for a while than sit back and watch him through his life away. I know, I know, people have been telling me that ""you can't save them all"" but I am sure gonna try my hardest. Well, I guess I am going to go. Laters. </P>
<P>P.S. THE MARY KAY PARTY IS ON THURSDAY AT 7:00! IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR SO PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN COME!!!</P>

Beauty,&lt;br&gt;laughter, life, magic...that's what you are all&lt;br&gt;about. You are refreshingly innocent and happy&lt;br&gt;with your life of purity and play. Life's a&lt;br&gt;game and it's a good one. In your eyes there's&lt;br&gt;no way to lose! You can be very mischeivous and&lt;br&gt;have been known to cause trouble, but it's all&lt;br&gt;in the name of fun and not meant to really harm&lt;br&gt;anyone. You like to play tricks on people who&lt;br&gt;aren't quite as bright or clever as you - which&lt;br&gt;is almost everyone. Nature is the setting you&lt;br&gt;prefer to be in - Always. Barefoot and wild you&lt;br&gt;can't be tamed. You're probably a restless&lt;br&gt;spirit who loves to travel, and quite a&lt;br&gt;dreamer. Your creativity is astounding and your&lt;br&gt;art (of whatever media - from writing to&lt;br&gt;painting to drama) is like something from&lt;br&gt;another world - ethereal and often very&lt;br&gt;fantasy-oriented. You can either be a social&lt;br&gt;butterfly or a loner with their head in the&lt;br&gt;clouds - but rarely inbetween. You stubbornly&lt;br&gt;refuse to accept responsibility or to give in&lt;br&gt;to the wishes of others - unless you feel like&lt;br&gt;it. You have a strong passion for music and&lt;br&gt;can't imagine life without it. You'll grow up&lt;br&gt;someday, but you'll always be a child at heart.&lt;br&gt;You are adventurous and love to take risks, and&lt;br&gt;feel a deep connection with the weather,&lt;br&gt;plants, and animals. You prefer sunshine to&lt;br&gt;thunder or snow, the warmth of summer to&lt;br&gt;autumn's chill, and quiet forests to suburban&lt;br&gt;backyards. Magic through and through, you are&lt;br&gt;far more powerful than you seem, and are&lt;br&gt;capable of being extremely passionate. Though&lt;br&gt;you can be childish, naive, stubborn, and&lt;br&gt;self-absorbed, one thing is certain - life with&lt;br&gt;you will never be boring!</P>

I don't know why the school insists that it be so cold all the time but I guess I don't really have a choice in the matter. Tomorrow is the Contest for choir so that should be atleast a little bit fun. I get to miss all day of school. My birthday is in 10 days! I am excited. and Andrea comes back on the 4th so everything is looking up. Well I am going to go and get started on my project for Lab so leave me a note."

Its been a long time since I have heard from you. aI have a choir concert tonight that I don't really want to go to. It is a couple of days untill contest and I am not looking forward to that either. My birthday is in 2 weeks and I am totaly excited. I am hoping to get my licens by spring break and that would be awsome. I am going out with Jason now, to any of you who didn't know. I am still a little sketchy about the relationship though. I don't know. He is a really sweet guy but I think that he gets stoned a little too much for my taste. He also likes to make out all the time and I like doing things that dont always involve kissing like going to a park or watching a movie or something. It just seems like he just wants to make out all the time and its really anoying. I am going to have a talk with him about it I think. Well, I just thought I would update real quick cause I haven't written in here in a while so I hope all of you are doing good.

P.S. I AM HAVING A MARY KAY PARTY ON THURSDAY, APRIL 8TH. LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COME. GUYS ARE INVITED TOO.

"event","<P><STRONG>Yesterday started off with my mom waking me up at 9:00 in the morning asking me if I wanted to go have breakfast with her. When we got home I called Jason to let him know that I was home and to call me when he was getting up so that we could hang out. Then t 10:30 I was going to take a nap but Renee called me and I went to help her paint the walls of her old house and then we got back to her house and I&nbsp;waited for Jason for like 3 hours.&nbsp; When he finally picked me up we went to the horseshoe and had some coffee and then I thought that we should go have a picknick at Lake Padden so we invited Jason and Clare to come along too. The plan was that we were going to have the picknick and then be back at the horseshoe to pick Oli up at 6:00 then go do something. But we were late picking up Oli and saw him walking so we went back to his house like he told us to and hung out there for the rest of the night at the party that was going on at his house. I drank quite a bit and then did somthing I might regret. I let Jason (not my best friend Jason, his neighbor) kiss me. I am still hung up on Matt for some stupid reason and I don't want to hurt Jason, I mean, I really like him but I don't want him to have to suffer because I am so stupid. So I am a little confused about that. Anyways, Clare was also having fun playing with my boobs the whole time. This morning I woke up and got dressed and woke my mom up so that she could take me to get laytex gloves for my speech thing and we ran into Jan, Dan's wife. I don't know if anyone remembers when I talked about Dan and how he died a little while back but&nbsp;his daughter just had a baby boy. I almost started crying cause I know that he will never be able to hold or play with him or anything. Dan was so happy when he found out that Jill was pregnant and I am almost in tears now knowing what could have been if he had been able to live. I think I am going to end this now so that I don't start crying. Later.</STRONG></P>"

"event","I know that I said that I was over him, but I guess I'm not. I cried myself to sleep last night because I was still upset that we are broken up. Of course Jason had to tell me that he was using Mary(sorry, she goes by Molly now) as a pillow. Shows that he cares a lot and is still planing on us getting back together huh? Anyways, so Jason said that we would go pick up Molly Muller and I agreed to it but I told him that the only onther person that I knew with the last name Muller was Mary...and guess what, it was her. I told him that I couln't stand her and he told me to give her a chance so I did and then he got what I ment about her. We ended up ditching her. LOL! Stupid bitch! She is one of thoes people that try to be exactly like you, when we were in middle school she tried to act like me, dress like me, and even went as far as to cut her hair like me. I don't know, I just don't like her. But yeah, I think I am going to hang out with Jason after school. I hope atleast. Well, I guess I am going to go. Later"

"event","<STRONG>So last night I went to bed after watching a movie at about 11:00 and I figured that I would get about 6-7 hours of sleep and I would be good. Well, that idea went out the window. Apparently, my sister called last night first and told my mom that she was getting evicted so we don't know if she and my two neices are going to be staying with us or not. Then, Mark (a family friend) called and wanted my mom to pick him up. This would have been all good but my mom and dad woke me up getting ready to go. Then, after I had finally fallen asleep, Mark and my mom came home and woke me up again. I decided this mornign that I would miss first period so that I could get another hour and half sleep. But yeah, that was my sucky night. Today I woke up with a migrain and I still have one. Well, I guess I am going to go. Later.</STRONG>"

"event","Last night my family and I went to dinner at The Mongolian Grill and then we went and saw the movie Cursed. It was an awsome movie and an awsome night. It was like my family actually loved and like each other. There was no fighting and it was all I could ever hope for. I was talking to my mom this morning and we were talking about moving n' stuff and she told me that she had also been looking at studio apartments and that when the time comes for me to move out, she will help me get a studio apartment. Ever since that one night that my sister, my mom, and I all sat down and talked, things between my mother and I have been so much better. I am glad that we had that talk. I dunno. I am really tired right now and I can't wait to get home and take a nap. My head is hurting too and I think I am getting a migrane. I am trying to get my old middle school choir teacher to come to the upcoming concert but it doesn't look like he is going to be able to go. Well, I guess I am going to end this. Later."

Last time I really talked to him, I was still mad at him for showing up drunk to my choir concert and missing me perform. I dunno. Leah...I am really sorry about your gradnpa. If you ever ever need to talk to someone, I am always here and you should know that. I might try and give you a call tonight. I am in lab right now and I am just waiting for class to get over. Is is just me or does the last class of the day just seem to take forever? Brandon is picking me up after school and I am going to help him and Renee get packed up to move. They found a place on Superior street off of Alabama. Well I guess I am going to go and find something to keep me occupied for the next hour and 15 min."

"event","There is still 23 minutes untill school is over. I want to hurry up and get home so that I can take a nap. I am soooo tired! This Mono is really kicking my ass. So last night, I was in my room trying to take a nap at like 6:00 and I wake up to my dad and my brother fighting. I guess it got pretty physical too. My brother told my dad that if he didn't leave, he was going to call the cops on him. I thought that was pretty funny cause if they found out that dad was living in the house with Barry and Mom, Barry and Mom would get in trouble too cause of the restrainign order. I thought it was all pretty stupid and I just kept my mouth shut and tried not to get involved. I don't know what is going to happen. It is my dad's birthday tommorow so I don't know if my mom and I are still going to go get him a birthday present. Why does my family have to be so fucked up? Why can't we all just get along and maybe just not talk to eachother. That way, none of us will have a reason to argue with each other. My head is really starting to hurt. I should be doing my lab work but I am having a hard time concentrating on anything school wise right now. I might have my sister help me with the summaries and that way I can get them over pretty fast. I don't know what is up with Jason. His phone is dissconnected and I don't know how to get ahold of him. He is also supposed to be doing the global history for me so that I can just get it over with. Well, I guess I am going to go now and maybe read. Later"

"event","Hmmmmm....I feel like I have completly wasted this break. I didn't do much but sleep. I don't know. Last night my mom and I watched movies together. We got ""The Notebook"" which was really good; and ""Rais Your Voice"" I thought that one was really good too. I like Hilary Duff but it was a really sad movie at times and I almost started crying. I am so tired! All I want to do is go home and take a nap or somthing but I have to go get my dad a birthday present so I can't really do that. He is turning 50 on the 2nd. Its amazing how old he is getting. Lol! I am going to go get black balloons and streamers and all that good stuff. I love 50th Birthdays! Well, I guess I am going to go."

"event","<STRONG>So yeah, so far break has pretty much sucked. I found out that I have mono and have been in bed most of the break. Sorry Britt! I didn't&nbsp;mean for you to get all freaked out. It was just a miss understanding, my dad didn't tell my mom that Brandon's car broke down. I dunno. But I am supposed to be going to the beach tomorrow night with Forest for a birthday party. Im not really sure what is up with Matt but we ended up seeing The Phantom Of The Opera with Clare and Jason and he kissed me. I bitched him out for all the stupid things that he has been doing and how much he was being an ass. I dunno. Total emotional conflicts going on right now. BAHHH!!!!! Anyways, I think I am going to go to bed now. I might get my hair cut tomorrow..... Who knows...but it will be a lot shorter....we'll see.</STRONG>"

"event","I had a pretty fun night. I went and hung out with Erin, brandon, and Renee the only problem was that I got stuck out here cause Brandon's car broke down. That sucked. But other than that we just drank and had fun. I was going to sleep with Erin (actually sleep you guys) but he was snoring to loud so I went out on the couch and then later on in the moring he came and laid next to me on the couch and then we went back and laid in the bedroom and I actually slept. Well, I am going to go. I'll write again soon."

So you know what, fuck him! I am getting so sick of all his shit and I'm not going to sit around waiting for him. I shouldn't have to go through that. I dunno. I told Jason that I wanted to hang out with him after school but now I think that I just want to go home and go to sleep. That still riquires spending about an hour after school. oh fuck, I have ASA never mind. Damn. Maybe I will call him and have him pick me up after that and just take me home. I dunno.

Catrina wanted to spend a few more hours at my house today and when I told my Mom that she flipped out and I bitched her out and now Catrina doesnt even want to come to my house anymore. And Chrissy im very sorry, I know what your going through and eventually it will get better. Time heals all wounds. I called Jay freaking out and I really do kinda wish he did come and pick me up. Im going crazy now that my Dad is home. I dont like it at all and I feel sick. I feel like I did lastnight. Right after I got my way I thought I was gonna throw up. LOL just my luck. Ohh well I hope tonight is ok and I hope Chrissy feels better and Im very sorry to Jay for the way Ive been treating him. Im not trying to. And I also feel really bad for Catrina bcuz she thinks what happend was her fault and its not, my Dads just an ass. Catrina is one of my best friends and I have so much in common with her and were always there for eachother and to think my Dad can do this to us. I wanna punch him. Fuck this.

You also fuckin blamed her for Chris kowing about everything between you and Brit... Well umm I told Chris you know that so why the fuck are you being such a lil bitch to Jillian? You make no sence. You brought everything upon yourself and your trying to blame everyone else for it. You also fuckin lied to everyone so many times we dont know what the truth is. Stop fuckin with us serously. Chris didnt do anything but love you, Brit didnt do anything but use you, Jillian and me didnt do anything but give two shits about you. Go fuck yourslef if your gonna try and be big and bad and hate the only people that care about you. You deserve what you have bcuz your being a lil dumb blond. Grow up. You havent been through shit. Your just a drama queen. Oh no you cut an aarow into your leg that NOT a big deal my friends have scars all over there bodies so get over that lil aarow thing. You brought that upon yourself and your the one messing up your life, not me, not Chris, not Jillian, YOU! If you try and do anything to Jillian or make her or Chris feel bad again I will shove a fuckin 2 liter bottle of soda up your ass and im sure that wont feel as good as Brits tiny lil fingers.

"event","Well Chris is upset. Im in the worst mood. My cousin is pissed at me for joking around with her when she does the same thing all the time to me. Jay is telling me what our plans are for tomorrow. He makes it sound like he has control over me even tho I asked him so I dunno. I kinda just want to be with him right now I dont wanna be by myself right now and I just dont feel good. People are pissing me off and these are the ones who dont even talk to me bcuz they think im a bad person. They think im a slut bcuz im not a virgin, they think im things im not and today is not the day. Besides the fact that my X friend is lying... Telling me I interfered with her and her X... if I did they would still be together but there not so obviously I didnt. I need to lose weight im getting sooooo fat. I weigh 144!!! I wanna get to 115 or something. Ohh well. I eat too much someone buy me thoes diet patches or something. 

P.S. Is it ok to cry when you miss your bf?"

"event","I am SOOOOOOO pissed right now bcuz like an hour ago I got the nicest letter from Mary. She didnt reply to the long letter I made for her bcuz it was a good letter and she doesnt wanna be my friend again bcuz I ""changed"" but when I tell her that Adam is being an asshole to my friend and she should talk to Chris she thinks she has the right to say what she did. I didnt lie, she did. I'll admit one time I lied to Chris and that was when I wasnt saposta tell him about Mary n Brit being back together, but I couldnt bcuz I had to keep my promise. Mary lies to almost everyone. She is the one changeing. Shes tellin me to stay out of her business... Umm I dont talk to her so how would I get into her business? That makes no sence in my opinion. Mary I dont know what your going through but maybe you should tell me. I'll tell you a few things about me lately...1) I am in the middle of a lot of bullshit and im not talking about you n Chris.2) I am getting hurt literally 3) people are fucking with my head and 4) I miss you but you hate me for stuff I didnt even do. So anyways. Why is it you hate me? I want the real reason...not that I ""chose Catrina over you"" or the smoking or me being a slut...haha im not a slut. I might not be a virgin but im not a fucking slut. I never have and never will cheat on Jay, is that ok? Get that I your head if you didnt figure that out yet. Wow this is fucked up I need to type in my entries to talk to you. Call me if you wanna talk and be my friend again. If not I will just type in these lil boxes. I miss terese I want her here with me and I also want SWS lol. I am so glad I have the friends I have and if you *cough* wanna be my friend go right ahead im here and im all ears for what you have to say.

P.S. I love Jason Christopher Vogel *10-18-03*

"event","I miss Jay. Today was alright but what really sucked was Ashley was being such a bitch and saying stupid things like ""You dress like a boy""...wtf? Im sorry I dont like showing off my body like she does and she shouldnt be doing that in the first place if she really wants someone to look at her in a good way and when I hit Jay shes like ""how about someone hit you that hard and see how you feel""...Well first of all thats none of her business second of all me and Jay hit eachother jokeing around all the time, jesus we fuckin wrestle eachother and she goes ad says that. To me thats fucked up and plus he hits me too. But like I said we only joke and he would never hit me bcuz hes mad, never. And when Catrina finds this out I know she will be mad bcuz she will think I actually wanted to hang out with Ashley. Yeah right. Ashley hates me why would I wanna hang out with someone that hates me. Plus after what she did I can never be her friend again and forgive her for fucking me Catrina and Elliott over. I just cant...But at the same time I want to be her friend just so this bullshit wouldnt be happening. This is all just fucked up. I miss everyone. One person I miss a lot is Morgy. Im going I dunno what else to say but I miss Jay so much I actually wanna cry and I hope tomorrow goes ok at school.

Then it started to rain and we went out for pizza. After that Jay drove me and Jessie to Nana Bucks to wish her a happy birthday. Well...we stayed for about 45 minutes and I was in the same room as Ash and yeah I got her and her mother pissed just by being there. Well I cant wait till tomorrow bcuz I get to hang around with my enemy. WOO HOO! And I cant wait till Catrina finds out bcuz that will be another reason for her to be mad at me. I told Jay something in the car that got him so pissed he started to speed. So that was fun...and it was raining too. Ohh im in such a good mood right now cant ya tell? People need to stop hating eachother and get over themselves. This is fucked up. I have to go before I get really pissed bcuz right now I feel like hiting someone.

Mary why the fuck wont you talk to Chris? Common serously if you dont think you should talk to him then just look at this: <FONT color=#3333ff>AnubisOfGod:</FONT> <FONT color=#3333ff>I went to Wendy's, it reminded me of Mary. I listened to a song on the radio in the car, but it reminded me of Mary. I sang a lullaby to Shelley, but it reminded me of Mary</FONT>....So what now Mary? Mary you serously need to stop and you need to talk to him even if it hurts bcuz I know it will but your not the only one who has to do things like this and you make it seem like your the one going through all the pain and your not. After all the stuff he tells me jesus hes going insane without talking to you. You need to stop hateing. Just talk to him! Wow its sad we need to ask you to talk to him you should be able to do it on your own and your acting like such a child. I thought you cared about other people. I guess not. Ya kno what at the same time im so mad at you and at the same time I miss you like hell. You are messing with everyones head.

"event","This entry is for Mary:
Mary I miss you. I miss being your friend and I miss talking to you. I know one of the big reasons your mad at me is bcuz you think I chose Catrina over you which I would never do bcuz I dont do that to my freinds...especially you. You were serously what I talked about after I came home from pre-k even ask my mother. You are awesome and you listen to people and you care about people. I hope you know I would love to be your friend again. Think about all the fun we had. We would always hang out even if your sister was with us. We would watch movies together and just chill. I remember being at your old house all the time and always doing dumb shit like prank calling people....but we still had so much fun. I remember all thoes times you were going to Florida and I remember how excited you were and you would always count down the days. I remember the way things use to be. You might not, but I do. And I know another reason you hate me is bcuz you think I lied to you which I would never do. And even if I did why would you hate me for that? You lied to me too. I dont want you to be mad when you read this and I dont want to get you upset I just want you to know I wanna be your friend again. I also know you hate me for that one night when I did 3 things...you know what they are. You cant tell me thats a reason to hate me bcuz what I did that night I did bcuz I cared about him and at the same time I was missing what I lost. Please dont hate me for making mistakes like that bcuz they didnt even effect you. But bcuz of that night alot of bad shit is happening. I wish I could just tell you, but you hate me enough as it is. What happend that night is hurting both of them and me so please dont hate me for that. Smoking...im sorry you hate me for that...its just something I do. I never thought I would do it but I did...and I remember one summer it was you me and Mim...Mims friend Danny wanted foil to smoke with and you said how much you hated people who did that n I even said ""would you hate me if I did it"" and do you know what you said?...You said ""no of course not."" And I know another reason you hate me is bcuz you think im completely on Chris's side. Well I really have no choice if you hate me with a passion. I havent heard your side of the story so of course im gonna be on his side bcuz its the only side I know. If you and me were frineds right now I would be mutual. You really hate me that much not to even wanna talk to me, fine...but I tried and remember I miss you and no matter what I will always be here for you and I will always open my arms to you. I love you Mary! Take care of yourself.

"event","The other day, it occurred to me that fantasy is harder to write well than fiction.

My fiction has historically tended to be overly self-conscious and ... hm, posed might be a good word for it: people doing what I want them to do instead of what they *would* do.  It's also borne little relation to any life in reality other than my own, which has been rather, well, weird, to say the least.  Add to that the license one has when writing fantasy -- the ability not only to arrange but to <i>create</i> reality -- and you have a recipe for disaster: well-developed characters who nonetheless live incomprehensible lives.

So I've decided not to write fantasy for a while.

Instead, I'm planning to write fiction, but to grind the glass first so I can see better.

Too much fiction seems to cling to the author's <i>idea</i> of how reality ""should"" be, or to write about how reality ""is,"" but in a tone of utter hopelessness.  I suppose that's all right if that's your aim -- but I want to write more about how reality is, not barring hope.

It was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_White"">Edmund White</a> who first inspired me to think about writing (that is, not to write, which I've always done, but to <i>think</i> about writing), I am thinking about rereading everything of his I've read, and reading everything of his I haven't.  We write about different things, but I consider him an inspiration.  Plus, he always believed in love, which I believe in.

Why I'm writing about this all, I'm not sure.  I'll be leaving Baltimore tonight, on a Grand Adventure of a scale heretofore unmatched in my small life.

So wish me luck, any of you who may be reading this."

"event","Alas, I can't recall the source of the story I'm thinking of, so I'll have to stumble lamely through it as if I were stricken with string-halt.

Some or another Great Teacher of Old once said something to the effect of, ""Disciples mine, become monks or drunks, but not priests.""  I would offer an explanation, but I am ashamed to admit I understand this apparent paradox only with the parts of me that don't speak English ... or, apparently, any other language.

I've been thinking about this principle lately.

I grew up in New England, home of the Invisible Iron Curtain.  This is the curtain that true New Englanders keep between themselves and the possibility of excessive experience -- we try not to feel to loudly, or to do anything too wild, in the interest of maintaining something we think of as restraint.

I suppose this has benefits.  I managed to come this far without acquiring any ... erm ... social diseases.

However, I also came this far cut off from real, deep experience: I experienced everything at a distance, through a filter.  I was cautious about being moved too deeply, or perhaps too far.

Admittedly, my experience may not be typical.  Even consumer goods now advise that 'Actual results may vary.'  So it may just be that I grew up in an extra-icy household.  My grandmother (who is, admittedly, a native of Canada) is much warmer and seems much more ... um ... experiential than most New Englanders.

However, I've realized that this very detachment we New Engladers rather prize is the antithises of mindfulness.

By now, you're probably wondering what my point is.

My point is this:

I mean to be, in a sense, both a monk and a drunk.

This winter I plan to spend some time at monastery in the Pacific Northwest.  I hope to improve my practice in meditation, in work, and in ... well, everything, more or less.  However, I also plan to spend some time in the cities, seeing what is to be seen.

I've thought about this.  Certainly, I've lived an urban life for a few years -- but I've never really experienced anything.

There's something here that's tough to actually articulate.  

During and after high school, I was a class-A prude.  I suppose I had my reasons for this, not least of them my atrocious (and I'm not being hyperbolic) experiences with my first boyfriend, for lack of anything else to call him without deluding myself or somebody else.  I didn't drink, I didn't dance, and I certainly didn't have sex.  Or fun, for that matter.

My second boyfriend taught me to drink and to dance.  We eventually had sex (short of the penetrative variety, though that happened once, and he said it was an accident).  Still, I remained extremely circumspect, as young, queer club kids go.

My third boyfriend, who I lived with for three years, was a major player in the Lexington/Louisville/Cincinatti Goth scene. At the same time, I was also the unofficially adopted child of a major figure in the national transgender/intersex community.  I got around a lot during those years (but not so much in the way people usually mean when they say somebody gets around).  I danced 'til dawn; I traveled; I enjoyed many sensual pleasures.

The sticky part is that I didn't really enjoy them -- I had momentary, mindless flings with them, and came away empty-handed (and occasionally bruised).  As always before, I never really experienced anything: it was like the scene in <i>The Last Emperor</i> in which Pu Yi (the young Emperor) is touched by his eunuchs through a piece of silk and leans longingly into the contact.  Touched -- but not touched.  I imagine such a touch would still leave you craving.

My prim, celibate period was as mindless as my wild, noncelibate period.  Because they were both mindless, and therefore disconnected from actual experience, both were ... well, in a way, bad.  Or, in a less logical-judgmental sense, not conducive, at least, to spiritual development.  A mindless celibate learns as little as a mindless slut.

The long and short of all this is that I was mindless, and now I'm learning to be mindful.  And I suspect that, given mindfulness, there is some value in going places and doing things that other people might think of as ... well, somewhat wild, perhaps.

This isn't to say I'm going to go sleep with any old guy in Seattle -- or even any young guy.  Truth be told, I'm not exactly planning to be anything other than celibate or faithfully involved with one person.  But I mean to dance, and watch, and maybe even drink, and learn.  I mean to go places with my eyes wide open that before I've only entered with them half-closed, as most people, I imagine, do.

I imagine there's much to be learned.  I suspect the dance floor offers lessons, just as the lonely seashore does -- though we generally miss them, since we're not looking for them there.

Edit: I realized that this entire entry was inspired by a <a href=""http://tokyoblog.livejournal.com/?skip=16"" target=""_blank"">quote</a> from <a href=""http://tokyoblog.livejournal.com/"" target=""_blank"">Moresukine</a>, which I forgot to mention: ""The crowd is as gay as a tree of parrots, but rather of the straight-acting, lumberjack-shirt wearting kind of parrot.""  This made me laugh out loud, really -- in part because it sounds so ... I don't konw.  Monty Python, perhaps?"

"event","I have some chronic lung problems, so I like to keep an eye on air quality, both here in Baltimore and around the country (and around the world).  Since I'm making a pilgrimage to the mountains of North Carolina, I figured I'd check out the air quality there.

Not surprisingly, I discovered that Baltimore is currently rated ""unhealthy for sensitive groups.""  This doesn't surprise me for a number of reasons -- first, Baltimore is part of the booming Northeast Corridor, probably the most densely populated section of the United States.  Second, there are a lot -- a *LOT* -- of people who live in the suburbs and work in the city.  By my current count, seven of them actually take public transportation.  You do the math.

However, I was quite surprised to discover that the Asheville rigdeline is <i>also</i> rated ""unhealthy for sensitive groups.""  I wouldn't have been surprised if that label had been applied to, say, Winston-Salem, or Raliegh-Durham-Chapel Hill-Nightsdale-Carey-Apex-etc.  But ... the ridgeline?  Asheville?

The valleys are rated ""moderate,"" which was the usual rating for downtown Louisville on any given summer day last year.  ""Moderate"" is sometimes enough to render me partially immobile.

To offer a sense of perspective ... last year, in Louisville, I had one of the worst years of my life in terms of respiratory health.  I found myself in the emergency room five or six separate times and was placed on enforced sick leave from work for over a month -- although I wasn't actually sick, at least, not in the conventional sense of the word.  I was not infected with virii or bacteria, I simply couldn't talk or breathe, and the more I tried to talk (a central function of my job, at the time), the worse the problem became.

Whether or not I like to admit it, I belong to a ""sensitive group.""  I don't like the notion, however, of having to take a billion medications just so I can hope to function.  It disturbs me that in the supposedly-pristine mountains of North Carolina, I could be worse off than I am in this neck of the East Coast Megalopolis.  Charlotte, however, is simply ""unhealthy"" -- meaning, I guess, that nobody there should leave home without a gas mask (note: I know several people from NC, and that's almost exactly what they say about the Charlotopolis, the Ralieghopolis, and the Winstonsalemchapelhillopolis).  If the air there makes them as sick as the air here makes me, at least, that's what it means.

It's beginning to look like the best part of the country for me to live in -- provide I don't up and move to another country entirely -- is the Pacific Northwest (well, short of living in the landlocked Northwest -- which isn't really my thing).  Even in the heart of summer, their air quality appears to be consistently good.  Louisville and Baltimore are respectively numbers 21 and 24 on the American Lung Association's <a href=""http://lungaction.org/reports/sota05_cities.html#anncitiespp"">worst cities evar</a> list -- various locales in Washington and Oregon, however, show up on the <a href=""http://lungaction.org/reports/sota05_table5a.html"">cleanest cities evar</a> list.  (These lists, respectively, rate the year-round-worst and year-round-best air quality for various cities in the US; there are also tables by county.)  Baltimore has the dubious honor of being regarded having unhealthy levels of both particulate (soot) and ozone (smog) pollution.

What worries me most about all this isn't the impact on my life, however -- it's the thought of our wild places being so polluted.  Asheville sits high in the Appalachians; it's located on the Blue Ridge Parkway, the most-visited unit of America's National Parks System.  Part of the reason so many people visit the Blue Ridge is its apparently-pristine scenic beauty.  It's good to know that the soul of beauty -- of real, wild beauty -- still moves so many people: but it's frightening to think that this center of wild beauty suffers under the same degree of pollution as do many of the United States' most urban areas.

I'm still deciding where I'll settle down -- and my decision will ultimately be made based not on tangible factors like air pollution (though I plan to pay *some* attention to those factors) but on the intangible: whether I feel at home and at peace in a given place.  If I wind up settling in a place that staggers under the burden of poor air quality, I'll just have to fight to help improve it.  But I am given pause by the sheer scale of destruction our reckless ways have wrought.

We have saddled ourselves with quite a problem, here.  I only pray that we'll be able ... and willing ... to make some progress towards solving it -- for the sake of all living things, before it's too late."

"event","Some people have quick minds and some people have slow minds; some people remember everything and some people remember only some things.  Some people remember everything -and- have very quick minds.  I'm not one of those people.

I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me, when it comes to living in the working world.  I have sometimes felt very stupid: not because I don't *know* enough, but because when I need that knowledge, I have trouble getting it into my head.  

Give me a while to think, and the information needed will come to me.  Give me a while to think, and I will even come up with new ideas and fresh perspectives -- but I'll never be swift in conversation the way some people are.  I just don't seem to think on my feet quite as well as most people.

I have a remarkable memory, though I almost never remember spoken words (instead I remember images, smells, sounds, music -- but spoken words and even written words, sometimes, are very hard for me).  It just takes me a long time to access the information I've stored: so when some one puts me on the spot, I generally fall short.  (Perhaps this is also related to the fact that people can easily convince me of things that aren't true.)

At any given moment, I suspect, most people are several frames ahead of me.  My mind travels by different roads (or maybe it just walks along in the grass at the side of the road).  Sometimes it winds up at another destination altogether.  That makes having a conversation with most people challenging sometimes.

This is not a very good kind of mind to have for work in technical support, or in the academic world, or in business. I wouldn't be good at reacting quickly to the stock market, or to the challenging questions of students in a classroom.  I would not be good at drawing up on the spot an immediate plan of action for people to follow.  Because of this, I don't make a very good leader in an intellectual sense.  I have a pretty good sense of direction, so I guess I could make a very good leader in a very literal sense, leading people around on trails in the woods.

Though I can fix my own computer and almost any computer you sit me down in front of, if I try to understand someone else's computer problems over the phone, it takes me a long time to think of what's happening, and how I should help him fix it.  A lot of the time I forget steps, even though I concentrate on my work.  I am simply not good at these things (in fact, I'm wholly bad at certain kinds of planning).

I'm better -- even quite good -- at remembering things with my hands or body: but when I'm trying to remember words and ideas, I have a very hard time, and they come to me after a long while, usually when I've stopped thinking about them.  Sometimes they come to me hours later.  This is especially true when I'm nervous, which I often am in social settings (which means that I can't defend myself in an argument).

I used to think this was bad.  I think because I grew up in an upper-class New England family, I came to believe that work of the hands and body was somehow lesser work.  The Important work, I learned, was the work of the mind, of ideas, of challenging subjects that involved higher learning.  I didn't see that the ability to read the weather and raise crops or to turn wood on a lathe was a kind of higher learning.

It was good not only to have a powerful memory, but a fast mind.  I knew I had a good memory: I thought that I must either have a fast mind and be too lazy to use it, or not have one and be stupid.  I didn't understand that you don't have to be fast to be smart -- or even that you don't have to be smart.  In the long run, the intelligence of the mind bears little meaning for someone who mostly wants to be at peace.

In my family, we told ourselves that we believed equally in the worth of the work of people who toil with their hands and bodies -- but if I really believed that, I wouldn't have been ashamed to admit for so long that the work to which I am best suited isn't work where I have to think of answers quickly, but work that involves my hands and my body as well as my mind.  I would have seen my writing and my ability to shape the physical world pleasingly as a good offering to the world.  I would have understood that my ability to relate to animals is useful.  I would have understood that I could put my ability to learn physical things, like martial arts and bicycling, to work helping me become clear-headed, so I could go about my daily life as a real person in the immediate now, instead of as a distracted collection of half-baked thoughts.

This is one of the problems with learning anything in a very competitive culture: when I rode horses, for example, I saw my innate ability as something that made me special and better, instead of simply seeing it as a means to peace and a gift from God.  When I began learning Tae Kwan Do, I felt the same way (at least, I did once I started applying myself in the least bit).  I am glad I didn't start learning kendo or aikido with the same mind.  I hope that when I begin to study a new discipline, or resume study of the  old ones, I will be able to do so without thinking, ""This means I'm better,"" or ""This means I'm worse.""  I hope to be able to harness the gifts I have for the benefit of everyone, and to be able to learn from other's gifts where I am lacking.

One of the things that drew me to Zen, in the beginning, was its emphasis on mindfulness: the practice of ""being here now.""  It was an idea I could relate to because of the work I've done with horses and on houses and because of gardening.  When I do those kinds of work, my mind, body, and hands are all together, focused in a way I have never been able to focus in the classroom or sitting at a desk (unless I'm writing).  I learned later that I can focus in that way writing code or fixing computers, but I don't think that's the kind of work I'm meant to do.

For a little while, in the last two years of highschool, I became quick and sharp enough to hold my own in very challenging discussions about literature and philosophy: something I can't imagine doing now.  I was able to do this in part, I think, because I relied heavily on caffiene in those days and didn't sleep very much at all.  My mind constantly worked on fast-forward.  By the end of my senior year, I was a neurotic wreck.  But still I didn't learn that the life of the mind was not my life.

Even then, I knew the feeling of being here now: it was the only peace I knew.  I had learned to be here now when cleaning stalls and planting or harvesting corn.  I had learned to be here now when playing the piano or the violin or when singing.  I used to spend a lot of time playing the piano because of that.  

The rest of the time, I was usually darting around in the past, the future, parts of the present that had no bearing on me directly ...   I wasn't there then.  In the classroom, I was often thinking ahead to my next point, instead of really listening.  In zen, that makes for a very bad conversation, even though that's how we listen in the Western world ninety-nine percent of the time.

So I heard about mindfulness meditation, and realized I wanted to learn to be here now all the time.  I think that in the beginning I believed that by learning to be here now all the time, I could shape myself into the person I wanted to be: here now all the time, swifter in mind, able to be the kind of son my family expected.

This made the first part of my zen practice, as you can imagine, unproductive and difficult.  After a while I gave up and became something of a lapsed Buddhist.  

I found I joked frequently about how you can't stop being a Buddhist, once you start -- all the while failing to see that what I thought of as humor was thinly-veiled truth.  I couldn't stop being a Buddhist.  Oh, I tried -- time and again -- but the lessons I had learned wouldn't go away.  Finally, I relapsed into Zen.

Recently I had a minor revelation: the mind that I have is okay.  For Zen, it might even be a good kind of mind, or at least, as good a kind as any.

Zen won't make me a quick-thinking social marvel.  It won't shape me into someone who is the kind of person my family expected me to be.  It won't shape me into anything that I'm not: but it will teach me to be here now, and part of being here now is knowing what you are and working accordingly.

There is a place in the world for someone like me.  There is nothing wrong with having a love of working with your hands.  I guess the fact that I'm even writing that means some part of me still finds the concept uncomfortable.

Likewise, it is all right not to be swift.  It is okay, even good, to be slow.  There are swallows in the world who zip around the sky and cranes who stand and think about things, and they play different roles and see different things.  We need cranes as well as swallows.  Likewise, it is good to be someone who likes to work with his hands, as well as good to be someone who can work quickly with his mind."

 face <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060618/ap_on_re_us/park_pressures;_ylt=Asctoviu5thuaoFWfN2bbqus0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3ODdxdHBhBHNlYwM5NjQ-"" target=""_blank"">increasing pressures</a> from developers, pollution, invasive species...

This isn't to say that there haven't been wars and environmental distress throughout history.  Just that, at this moment, it looks a lot like we're about to plunge ourselves into an apocolyptic global conflict, and even if we don't, our insistence on destroying the very resources we require to live will still push us over the edge into a Mad Max-inspired post-apocalyptic lifestyle.

Not that part of me really minds.  I would miss teh Intarwebz, should something like that come to pass, but I would not mourn the loss of our frenzied global economy, the unsleeping beast determined to drive us all mad.  Neither would it hurt many of us in the 'developed' world to be slapped with the responsibility of tending to their lives with their own hands.  It's the catastrophe preceding it that worries me.  I'd be happy to live in a post-apocalyptic world ... provided there's a world left, post-apocalypse.  Sometimes I really do think that our species suffers from some kind of collective suicidal mania.

Either way, I pray not for the preservation of our poisonous way of life, but for the preservation of the greater good, the greater whole.  I believe mankind has something to offer the Universe, or else we wouldn't be here.  I pray for the preservation of mankind: the world can and will go on without us. I pray for the enlightenment of all souls and for understanding to be born between nations.

And if I, for one, have to die so peace can be born, I am willing to die."

"event","Today I decided to look up the story behind <i>The Last Samurai</i>, and I discovered a bounty of historical stuff of use.  However, I also discovered a rather extensive community of people who took a greater or lesser degree of exception to the movie, referring to it as 'Dances with Samurai,' among other things, and spent a great deal of time explaining what they thought the movie has to do with white guilt, and wondering why we Americans don't just find sources of inspiration in our own culture.

I won't say the movie was perfect -- I don't think we mere mortals have yet achieved perfection.  I will say, however, that I went in to see it expecting some pretty swordplay surrounded by Eurocentric pontification ... and came away rather impressed with the fact that, fantasy though it may be, if you were willing to take the movie for what it was -- a *movie,* for God's sake -- it had a lot to say about devotion and standing by your beliefs.

We Americans do find sources of inspiration in our own culture -- and for a long time, our own culture was the only place we found them at all.  That we're looking beyond our own borders for ways of thinking and being that might broaden our horizons is a good thing.  It isn't necessarily the result of white guilt or of imperialism -- rather, for many of us, there's a longing to learn, to belong to the world at large, and not only to our own small nation.

<i>The Last Samurai</i> is a fantasy.  Not only that, but it's a good fantasy.  It has a nobler purpose than a lot of our movies these days.  It's not about money or fame (and only marginally about glory), but about living and dying by conviction.

It is true that we in America have romantic notions about Japan and other nations in the Far East, and that they often only border on being what you might call canonically true.  It's also true, however, that various regions of the world have been fascinated by each-other throughout history, and that there's much we stand to gain by learning ways outside our own.   In <i>Hagakure</i>, Yamamoto Tsunetomo observes that there are no good models extant among living men, and advises the young samurai of his day to instead build their own models, taking from various men that which is best.

Likewise, we can look back upon feudal Japan and take as a model for ourselves that which is best.  It is true, I imagine, that nobody ever quite lived up to the ideals of bushido -- but the fact that those ideals failed to flower in perfection is no reason to simply cast them on the rubbish heap.  To look at it from a different perspective, that would be like declaring all the lofty ideals of America's founding fathers to be worthless simply because they were not perfected in their day (and still have not been): in other words, patently ridiculous.

Men are still men.  Men have always been men.  We have never perfected anything -- but that's no reason to give up striving, and holding dear that which is beautiful, even when that which is beautiful cannot be brought perfectly into being.

<i>The Last Samurai</i> is a fantasy that draws for us an image of the perfect attainment of a set of virtues by one man and the awakening to and pursuit of that set of virtues by another man.

If we have become so jaded as to be unable to see that, perhaps we should watch the movie a few more times."

"event","So the Windows Vista beta is out there, ready to eat.  Or, well, at least ready to taste-test.  Or, at least, it would be, if the demand for the download didn't vastly outstrip the internet's resources.

Yes, I said *the internet's* resources.

According to <a href=""http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/006715.html"">InfoWorld Tech Watch</a>, reports suggest that ""Microsoft is warning users to order a DVD of the Windows Vista beta 2 rather than downloading it because it says it can't deliver more bandwidth without impacting the Internet."" It also refers to Vista's DVD ISO as ""most bloated product the software giant has ever shipped.""

On its <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/preview.mspx"">Vista preview page</a>, Microsoft itself advises would-be beta-testers to order the DVD kit rather than downloading the software, noting that ""The wait time to start the download is very long and many customers may be unable to access the download site.""

In Microsoft's list of what you'll need to get Vista, a broadband internet connection is ""highly recommended.""

I would say so.

Geeks the world over may simply have to order the DVD kit and delay their gratification (or irritation, depending) -- or risk the long, long wait for the download and the potential of crippling our favorite form of entertainment and interpersonal connectivity.

A couple of years ago, <a href=""http://www.archieholland.org"">Archie Holland</a> predicted the semi-impending collapse of teh Intarwebz themselves.

Following these new developments, I'm now much more inclined to think that the End Times -- at least, teh End of teh Intarwebz tiMes -- are, indeed, near."

"event","I don't pay anything even remotely resembling enough attention to current events in the world, and even I can see that the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo is an atrocity.  Some may say that all developed nations have their secret military prisons, and that the torture and atrocious suffering of a few is ultimately worth the greater security of the many -- but I don't see it quite that way.  'Everybody's doing it' has never been a justification for anything.  After all, if every other nation in the world were jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge...

The few have the right, if they desire, to lay down their lives for the many.  This has always been a noble calling: to live and die fearlessly for Right.  We do not all agree on what Right is, but few of us are so heartless that we can't at very least respect someone that stands behind his convictions even unto death (disregarding the few who choose to take innocent people with them) whether or not we see eye-to-eye with him.

However, when a certain Few choose to torture or murder another few in the name of the Greater Good, we have to consider the cost.

You cannot beget peace through suffering.  You cannot create shockwaves of suffering in the world in order to achieve security.  This cannot be done.

The repercussions of the suffering of prisoners at Guantanamo will echo through the nations of the world.  I pray for the awakening from madness of anyone who is deluded enough to believe that the U.S. will become more secure as a result.

Colleen Graffy, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for public diplomacy, described the alleged <a href=""http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=newsOne&storyID=2006-06-12T111609Z_01_N10232278_RTRUKOC_0_US-SECURITY-GUANTANAMO.xml&src=061206_0744_TOPSTORY_calls_for_guantanamo_closure"" target=""_blank"">suicides of three prisoners</a> -- two Saudis and a Yemeni -- at Guantanamo as 'a good PR move.'  The families of the three prisoners <a href=""http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=newsOne&storyid=2006-06-12T111606Z_01_L12343614_RTRUKOT_0_TEXT0.xml&WTmodLoc=NewsArt-L1-RelatedNews-1"" target=""_blank"">argue that the deaths weren't suicides at all.</a>

Either way, people do not kill themselves for public relations.  They kill themselves either to die honorably with their convictions intact or because their suffering has outstripped their will to live.  Considering that the human will to live is considerable, and that almost every religion in the world carries strict injunctions against suicide, this is no small matter.

If the deaths weren't suicides, that opens a whole new can of worms.

Meanwhile, American officials continue to flash mirrors and blow smoke, hoping that they will once again manage to distract the gaze of the world from the horrors their nation is committing.

British Constitutional Affairs Minister Harriet Harman asks, of Guantanamo prison, ""If it is perfectly legal and there is nothing going wrong there, why don't they have it in America?"" 

I, an American, want to know, too.  Why are we, a nation that the world once turned to as a model of justice and peace, behaving this way?  Why do our officials continue to lie, to be exposed, and then to offer lame excuses for their previous lies?  Why are so many Americans so bitter and blinded by hate that they're not able to understand why the rest of the world is angry about this?

Why don't people in America say to themselves, ""What if it was my brother?"" (Or father, or sister, or aunt, or uncle...)  Why don't we say to ourselves, ""How would I feel if I were treated this way?""  Why don't we say to ourselves, simply, ""These are human beings.  Why don't we show them compassion?""

Then, we have, as a species, never been as good at compassion as we might hope, and we're always better at it in a vague general sense than we are when we're faced with actual individuals.

Here in the United States, our leaders claim that their reprehensible behavior is justified because we are trying to find a way to peace.

As A.J. Muste once observed: There is no way to peace.  Peace is the way."

"event","Until recently, I lived in Louisville, KY.

Like many Louisvillians, I appreciated my city -- I even loved my city.  How can you not love a place with the largest concentration of Victorian homes in the United States, which rest entwined with a fantastic park system that spreads throughout the city?  But I fell on hard times there because of some health problems (and the ridiculous decision to live in the God-forsaken East End 'burbs), and this January I finally wandered away to the East Coast, ostensibly to hang out with my relatives while I got better, but in truth because I freaked out and turned into a raving moron.

Now I have to wonder what I was thinking.  I could've come up with something else ... I know I could have.  But instead I chose to freak out and run away from the city I loved ... and I guess that, like they say, you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.

So from this rough, angry place I hail Louisville's gentle drivers, green streets, balmy waterfront, and cool, cool people ... and I wonder, what in the name of all that is Holy am I doing here?  Here, it's expensive, angry, gritty, and the drivers hate pedestrians with such hellish passion as I have never before experienced (yes, they *will* try to kill you, if you're not paying attention).  Here, it's every man against the world, every man for himself, except, ironically, in the neighborhoods people think of as 'rough' -- which are the only ones in which people say, ""G'morning,"" ""Excuse me,"" ""Thanks,"" ""Are you okay?""  (Though, admittedly, you get a fair amount of, ""You got fifty cents?  I'm trying to..."")  The haves step on the faces of the have-nots so they can get a better view of the harbor, and the East Coast rat race consumes us all (and all our money, to boot).

Thich Naht Hanh reminds us that we don't have to run away from the world to heal it ... but I suspect it's probably dumb to run away from the places that heal us in an effort to save ourselves.

Once again, I can only say, ""What was I thinking?"""

"event","I'm reading essays from a website belonging to one of our clients, <a href=""http://www.mdfinancialskills.org/"">MD Coalition for Financial Literacy</a>.  They were the winners of a contest inviting teens to write about the need for financial literacy eduction -- and they all seem to be fairly together.  However, one of them mentions how important financial literacy is in a society where most people live above their means -- which left me a little cold.

Here's the problem: in Maryland, working and middle class families cannot -- that's right, can *not* -- buy a house outside of Baltimore's inner city while remaining in Federal budget guidelines (which state that housing payments should not exceed 25-30% of the household's monthly *net* -- not gross -- income).  That means if people who work in Maryland want to live here, they *have to* live outside their means -- and it's not just here.

Admittedly, lots of people make irresponsible decisions, especially in the area of purchasing things like televisions and bedroom furniture on credit.  But even for people who don't, the simple cost of living frequently outstrips earning power ... and all the financial literacy in the world won't make their lives easier.  It doesn't matter if you never go into debt if you can't secure decent housing at a good price that's convenient to your place of work: you're still forced to live outside your means.

I have to wonder whether people just aren't aware of this gap, whether they choose to ignore it, or whether the Powers the Be in our debt-reliant economy want it this way.

Not to knock MD Coalition for Financial Literacy.  Their goal is a noble one, and I think they do a pretty good job with the resources they've got -- but a lot more than a few attitudes must change before people will really be able to live within their means.

A lot more."

"event","I've been thinking about something.

Yet again, our fearless leader has decided to throw up another smoke-and-mirrors campaign to distract all of us from the atrocities our country is committing in the name of Big Oil while depriving a few of us of the chance to ever hope for equal rights.  Yet again, the issue of gay marriage is trotted out just in time to try to raise Bush's historically-low public opinion ratings.

So I live in a country that's embroiled in two unjust wars and spoiling for a third, where there's an unending waste of taxpayer dollars -- I mean, battle -- aimed at depriving me and people like me of one of the most basic human freedoms ... and I'm just supposed to continue to be a good little patriot and hope for a savior.

How's that supposed to work?

Nobody complains when people from other countries decide to leave when their civil liberties are taken away.  In this country, where I've never had the full complement, I'm just supposed to sit by and hope?

I am happy to hope for America -- but right now, I'm seriously considering hoping for America from a distance, in a place where I actually have a fighting chance.

Sometimes you have to crawl out of the pit if you're to have any chance of throwing a rope to others struggling within it.

Public opinion of the Bush hegemony -- and, in the world at large, of the United States as a whole -- is low because Bush and his cohort have embroiled this country in an unending, unwinnable, immoral war, not because queer people might some day be able to get married.  

I don't have to stick around and wait for people to figure that out."

"event","why do i do this to myself 
why do i sit n wonder
n sit n cry
when all it does is tear me up inside
but life moves on
this may be so for some
but not me 
so i have to pull down my sleeves
and cover these scars
just so i dont wanna
just so i dont cry
just so i dont do it again
but yet i want to...
i want to do worst...
but i cant 
i cant do that to my family
i cant do it to my friends 
i cant do it i keep promises 
so now all i do is stay up
and wonder
and cry because of how u make me feel inside"

"event","Okay, so tomorrow i'm leaving for spring break, and i'm very excited. But right now i'm bored to tears! Katie took the tv home with her because it will be in our new house, so i'm stuck here without much to do. Not having a tv really forces you to examine your life. I find that i have no life. I have already done the internet thing - over it. I packed all my books into my car, or else i would be reading one, and i have no movies to watch on my laptop, and i've already watched three buffy episodes. I guess i could clean the dorm (it's really dusty) or do homework (yeah right). So now, i'm just typing this, listening to my suitmates get ready to go out (on a THURSDAY!!), but it's rainy and i'm not in the mood to tolerate a bunch of drunks who have been wasted since 5am. So i'm just complaining instead."

I'll blame it on the sickness I'm feeling, which i blame on my roommate! Anyway, gotta love her. So. I work 3 days a week, in the morning (8am) and it sucks. there is only one day that i get to sleep late, thank goodness. So yeah, my birthday was last week, and it was fantastic. Thanks to all of my Miami friends for taking me to eat and watch Red Eye, and to my other friends for the birthday wishes. 

On a side note, I miss chels. I need to call her or else I'm going to cry.

"event","Thanksgiving weekend. What more do i have to say? It was a time of giving thanks (duh). I spent more time with family than ever before. It was insane. And you know what is even more insane? Your aunt telling you that pot and shrooms are ok (because they're natural) but not to do coke. And telling you about her honeymoon to europe (specifically amsterdam) and all the fun that they had there. And driving around your drunk father and stepmom is always a nice way to spend thanksgiving. But don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun. Family get-togethers on my dad's side are always a blast. My family is like a sitcom, and i like it that way. And my stepdad's family came in from philly, which is always fun times. I got to endure from all sides how much more grown up i was, both in appearance and in behavior. And on the friends front, i didn't get to go to jacobs like i wanted. It was my decision, and i'm kind of regretting it now, but running on two hours of sleep and going clubbin is not an option for me. But i did miss all my friends that i didn't get to see. However, going out to dinner with Anna and seeing ash was fun, and then seeing napoleon dynamite for the 45th time with anna and chels was a blast. I miss everyone so much. I can't wait until break, and i'll have 3 weeks to fool around with everyone. Hopefully next time i'll get to see bev! and adrienne, and everyone else. I hope thanksgiving was good times for all."

"event","Ok. so definitely, I had a really good night. After a long talk with matt about some misunderstandings, sarah and i went to see the Prez debate and then they showed Napoleon Dynamite, which i love. It is so hilarious, if you haven't seen it, you need to. I'm coming home this weekend for my ""fall break"", yeah right, a break does not constitute one day. But anyway, I'm going home thursday, and i'll hopefully see all of my friends there if they have not forsaken me. And it's Ashley and Adrienne's 19th birthday this weekend. How exciting is that? Yes, I know, it is really very exciting. Katie's not here and i think our room is haunted, so this will be interesting."

"event","Almost totally stressed out right now. I shouldn't be, becuase I finished everything i needed to do for today, but i really don't have a good feeling about my english paper. Who the hell knows what the conceptual metaphor is in a paper about teenagers and contraception? If you do, tell me. On second thought, don't tell me, because I don't care. i'm finished with the paper and that's that. I just really need a break right now, and i can tell you that my fall break isn't enough. Friday is not a break, it's a 3 day weekend. I'm contemplating just staying here. But we'll see. I'll only do it if people come up and visit me. And since my ""friends"" don't ever return my calls (with the exception of a few), i'm assuming no one will visit me. And that's where I leave it. Have a good day."

"event","ok, so my week has been crazy. My computer wasn't working earlier, but now it's ok

i've cried this week; thursday was officially one of the craziest days (emotionally-wise) that i've had in a long time.
I cried [a lot], and i talked to people from home about various things, which put me in a better mood, and kt and matt and i stayed up really late and watched how to deal and we talked until about 2 in the morning which was really awesome, then i had to wake up at 7. I was not a happy camper in the morning.

Yesterday (friday), my mom and my grandma came up for a little bit, and we saw the Miami University Symphony Orchestra. There was a song performed by global rhythms, and it was so completely and utterly awesome, the rest was just mediocre. And then we went to see the a capella groups on campus: the cheezies and remnants (boys) and the misfitz (girls). they were all awesome, but i really like the remnants the best. They sounded great, and get really into it. I want their cd. And then I came back to the dorm and sarah, matt, kt and i watched Office Space. It was so hilarious. i definitely understand why everyone who sees it loves it.

And today we woke up and went to the $6 China Buffet with tara, matt, and sarah. It was a lot of fun. we then watched pirates of the carribbean. And then we saw the notebook, and we all shed a little tear. Late night wendy's is a good idea - frosties and french [freedom] fries are great. Also great, star gazing. shooting stars are the coolest, and it's just a neat feeling. 

So overall, a good time. I'm pretty happy here, except for the fleeting feelings of inadequacy. But i have some really good friends here now, and that's all that matters, but i really do miss my friends at home and elsewhere. You guys are awesome and i love you."

"event","yeah, just to update you about my insane work load. This week and last week i've had to write 2 papers for english, with one more coming up, 2 papers for religion (one of which i've just finished, i've had to write 3 at least one page short essays for anthropology, and study for a test in there, i've had to study for a test in microbiology, and i have to write an essay in spanish. And that's on top of all my reading for those classes. i'm really bogged down right now and feeling stressed. i live for the weekends. and that's the end of this entry. except for i'm getting a hair cut on friday. boogie-woogie!"

"event","""Come Around""

I'm dressed all in blue and I'm remembering you
And the dress you wore when you broke my heart
I'm depressed upstairs and I'm remembering where
And when and how and why'd you have to go so far
Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
Unless you come around so come around
I'm dressed all in white and I remember the night
You came on to me and opened up my heart
I was hollow then till you filled me in now I'm empty again
I should have never let it start
Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
Unless you come around so come around
No one else can fix me although sometimes my heart tricks me
Into thinking someone else will do
But you're the only one you are the only one
Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
Am I gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be lonely for the rest of my life
Unless you come around so come around
So come around so come around
I'm dressed all in blue and I'm remembering you
And the dress you wore when you broke my heart

"event","So, over the weekend... Bev came and visited me and we had bunches of fun. Walking around Oxford at midnight is so freakin awesome. And then I went back to my home. and slept in my own bed. it was so nice. 

I also so an AMAZING movie. In case you didn't guess, it was Garden State, and everyone should see it at least once. and i want to see it again. it was that good. I'd PAY to see it again. And in two days, i'm going to have a birthday. and i will be 18. and i'm going home this weekend, so if you want to hang out, just give me a buzz."

"event","Today is Thursday. In one week will be my birthday. I will be eighteen. I am going to go home on Saturday the 11th to celebrate with friends and family. And Bev is coming tomorrow and spending the night. which will be so cool - I am way excited. And I am in a choir. an all girls choir, but it is so much fun. The only bad thing is that the weekend of our retreat is the weekend that i was going back to Cincy to celebrate. so i have to cut it short by one day, which is a lot when you only have three days to spend between two families and my friends. Oh well, I'll just have to deal with it. 

So far the boys here suck. Maybe i'm just being anti-social, but they just don't seem to be very friendly. and that's a problem. I hope things get better here in the boy department. If not, i'm transferring to UC. Just kidding. I do miss all of my friends and family and I'm so glad that i'm coming home soon. Chels, if you read this, call me and we can hang out sometime this weekend. And Nancy, happy birthday tomorrow."

"event","So i'm going to update now, finally, and say how much I miss my friends and family. I'm so lucky that i'm not far from anyone. Except for a few people. But I've been talking to my family on the phone a lot, and my friends some ... You guys should send me letters : 327 Morris Hall/651 S. Maple Drive/ Oxford, Ohio 45056.
I'll get it. I'm the mail sorter (with katie) so i'll get it and feel special. You know you wanna. 

guess who's coming to Miami to visit me? BEV! I'm so excited. this is my first visit from a friend. and yeah, it'll be great. And, yes, i've been to some parties, but they weren't that much fun. I'm hoping that they'll get better. Yes, and my classes, well, they're classes. And my schedule is crazy. Monday and Wednesday I have FIVE CLASSES, and i'm not finished with everything until 6:15. But on Tuesday and Thursday I only have one class and am finished by 11. And friday I have three and am finished by 1. And tomorrow i'm auditioning for the Collegiate Chorale. and i don't know if i'll get in, but i'm going to try. 

I miss you all. And i'm coming home on September the 10th (that's one day after my 18th birthday) to celebrate with friends and family. 

The End."

"event","So, yeah, i'm doing a little late night laundry after i got back from hanging out with chels. We had some good clean fun; eating at ffb and having the server with the hot eyes, going to see little black book, which was surprisingly good, and then saying goodbye, because it was the last time i'll see her before i leave on friday. I am going to miss her so much. I've known her since 5th grade, and she has always been supportive of me, and someone i could talk to whenever i needed someone. I'm going to miss that so much. This whole leaving thing is so much harder than i expected it to be. 

tomorrow i get to go to king's island (for free) with the fraziers, anna, and david. it ought to be interesting, and it will be the last time i see them before i go to school. And then on thursday i'm having dinner with my family and bev, and will get to say goodbye to her. All these goodbyes. it's so sad. i don't know if i'm ready for this. But i'm talking like i'm hours away. It's like an hour and a half tops. But it's going to be hard leaving everyone and not seeing them regularly. You all will be missed."

"event","oi. I'm feeling a lot of mixed emotions right now. I'm so excited and ready for college (aka going away), but i know this week is going to be the last time i see people on a (semi)regular basis. and i'm going to miss a lot of people i didn't know i would. and i'm not going to miss people i thought i would miss. and that's sad. I don't really know what is going on right now in my life, like with anything, and it is almost starting to piss me off. things just keep getting thrown at me, and it's hard to just take a step back and take a deep breath. I really don't want to think about what will happen in the months that i'm not here. i don't want to think about the people i may never see again, and if i did, how weird/akward/amazing(?) it will all be. I don't want to leave my friends that i've had for years and who have always been there for me. I don't want to risk them forgetting about me, and generally having the times of their lives without me (how selfish is that?!)

I won't forget about all the amazing times i've had with every single person that has been my friend. And i'm going to try my hardest to keep in touch with you all. But it goes both ways. Don't go all shannon on me. OR ELSE! 

School is just around the corner. I leave friday morning. Thanks Colin and Alan for helping us move in. I think i'm ready. 

Oh yeah, josh groban was AMAZING!! And we saw lots of people there (Mrs. Ferrell and her sister, Joe Sofranko, and Mrs. Miller). And thanks Laura for coming. you are amazing. and i'm looking forward to you rumpus on sunday."

"event","Wow. shannon's birthday party. that is something. i can't believe that kid is 18. it seems like just yesterday we were in the third grade. all of that's over now. and i feel like i'll probably never see her again. Like that part of my life is finally behind me. But of course, i'll want to see all of my friends who are an active part of my life. you'll always be a part of me. 

so yeah, my big birthday's coming up soon. I'll be 18 on September 9th. Labor day weekend i'm coming down from Miami to celebrate with friends, and the following weekend is reserved for family, although i'm sure i can escape for one night. I would like to say I am really excited about this, and I want it to be fun. I love you all, and i mean LOVE, and i mean ALL OF YOU. so, i'm going to sleep now, and still want to see Napoleon.

after the tons of fun bus ride you greeted everyone on the bus-we entered you said ""ITS MA BIRTHDAY"" and got in free. we proceded with every girl into the bathroom. When we got back you hugged connols butt and he and i did full shots while u and chris split one. you then announced...""that wasnt good...WERE GOING DANCING"" grabbed his hand and pulled us upstairs leaving brian somewhere, but we didnt care. i went to dance with everyone else, u stood on the stage with chris crying and hugging. barb and i tried to get u to stop but u yelled at us because we ""werent sensitive to the fact that hes going to die in a war"" you wouldnt leave him so we left u with chris meanwhile allison is dancing with 2 black guys and a jordanian...we laughed at her and mers horrific dancing (mer tried to grind with everyone but was too drunk to know what the fuck she was doing) barb and i then learned.....THE TOWEL...by ben zilly. mer dances on josh who is leaning on the wall but he cant take it and laughs and runs away. i went to spend quality time with larson downstairs, he acted bizaar licking my cheak and lifting me up. we went upstairs i found u holding a strangers hand u wouldnt leave him bc ""he was gonna get us free drinks...im working on it amy"" ...u had a drink...so i got brian and he finally got u away after u gave him the ""hold a second finger"". i walk away for ONE SECOND and i come back to u crying...u tried to hold his hand and brian burned u...awww...micky took u to the bathroom and brian asked me and barb to teach him to dance it was bad. then he asked if i wantd to meet some guys i said...no. lol but met them anyway...and said that mean thing about nick. me and larson and brian were talking and u through up so we decide time to go and mer takes u for air i go yes...into the mens room for brian...he wasnt there...so i found him elsewhere. u sat with mer on the curb completely disoriented al found the bus and u got on...i came on, screamed at mer for 15 min took u off to puke. we hear take me home tonight...perfect way to end i think, and thats what we did. we drive home allison and ben (and bri) are the only ones still drinking...everyone else is passed the fuck out cept them me and chuck..and becky and chris making out in the back and everyone throughing up. i make chuck take u up instead of drunk alison and u wont let him touch u...u hit him and so he just guides u up. and we change u (not chuck me and al) i ask if ur cold and wanna sweatshirt, u say ""do i? i dont give a fuck. give it to me"" and u put it on and lay down...but no u werent done with ur wierd actions. brian is drinkin the liqued crack and comes down stares but u quickly follow somehow and start mumbling mean things at him ask him what the fuck hes doing and nick respounds (this pissed me offf) hes drinking liqued crack...oh no now someone will say that i sold him crack and now hes addicted. we just blew him off and u 2 went up. me and amanda went into kens old room to talk about gayman and becky. i just got bored and went upstairs to sleep bc i ddint wanna be with the loser guys and moocher girls downstairs. ohh and on the pitstop home connol passed out on the cooler and becki tried to get over him but didnt and kicked him in the head and fell flat on her face ...me and barbe made fun of allison bc she was singing and dancing by herself. and thats it well not but thats the over view. hope u enjoyed it...i know i did.

Confucius once said that everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it. alas it is prom time, a time for girls to go over board on dresses, hair, and makeup, and boys to plot there oh so consiquencial nite. Who will be in their group? Where will pictures be? What time will we leave? When does the limo come? What will we do after? Ah... doesnt sound fun to me, and yet, I have been prodded into attending this cliche bathetic spiel. PEople thinking im some sort of grisette are wrong, i like to have a good time, not with school kids, with chaperones, and a pathetic date who thinks he knows all the moves to N'SYNC's bye bye bye video.  But Im pretty sure i will be attending, with some boy i dont know, who is said to be...ah yes...shorter than all  5 feet 9 inches of me. and to add to it, its my half birthday...the best part of the entire deal...leaving early and going to a concert downtown.
most people would call they're prom night, a night to remember....
hopefully i can forget.

I have returned from KAIROS. ah the uncertainty of it all. what an eye opening expirience for me, not souly fun, not souly soul. I am so happy i went, i truly believe i have come out a different person and i really want others to consider going also....My marist girls i met were so adorable, I <3 a bunch of them..and the other girls i met from marian were awesome, they were all so beautiful, and helped me so much. Each girl was such an inspiration and i thank them all for what they gave me. i can never say i feel alone anymore, because i have kairos105 with me when ever i need them. Kairos isnt just Gods time, it was my time. time for me to find me, and love me. i reflected on past expiriences, choices, bad decisions, and have come to be at peace with myself and God. this doesnt make you a jesus freak honestly if you go. i am still the same amy, just improved. i have learned alot about myself, including the fact that i run away from relationships with my friends, God, family, and especially guys because i dont want to expirience rejection or  pain, but i have learned that i do want some meaningful relationships with all of the above. i no longer fear to put myselt completely out there, i want those relationships that i've always pushed away...including trying to have meaningful ones with...guys...i know i said it... me right? amy wants to have more than a one night thing? i know...hard to believe, but true. but if i never go out the extra mile, how will i find what im looking for? OH OH OH AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU! a marist girl brought her guitar and the first day...i played for a bunch of girls...it was AWESOME. they were so supportive of me and my music, and they loved it. it made me feel so talented, even if my chords arent the toughest, and the lyrics arent the deepist, it touched them that i just played and sang my own things, and i loved it. i truly do want to pursue music in my future. It defines a large part of who i am. AWA2IG2AC

Its so wierd that I'm in a good mood today. Everything seems so good right now I just hope i don't mess it up.  I have good grades this quarter....I know me the girl who doesnt try hardly at school...actually I usually get good grades..but this time they are better than usual. My english teacher said i was a great writer and maybe i should be one, what she doesnt know...and most of you probably dont know is that i am a writer...that is i write those words too stupid spoken in song (voltaire) I love music, I've been writing alot more, and i always say...when my album comes out, or when Im famous... to people, and thats stupid, im not getting any younger, i should start now, and the verdict? move  to california. just kidding. like  i could do that in the last semester of my junior year...IN HIGH SCHOOL. lol i wish i could, shit do i, but i can't, because what if it doesnt work out? id have NO FUTURE. lol thats stupid because music is my future...i just wish i could do that, wish i had the balls
i wish i had someone to go with, than i would but linds cant so i guess its just a solo deal for me. i will do it. i am going to. because we built this city on...ROCK AND ROLL.

ugh im so sick of where i am right now its not even funny. stuck at school with mostly people i dont like, taking classes i dont care about, worrying about the rest of my life when all i can think about is being somewhere else. i wish the rest of highschool would fly by and i could be anywhere but here. the chaotic world of a 17 year old catholic school girl may sound trivial, thus the problems arise.  looking cute, being thin, nice clothes, they all add up to one misinterpretation of lots of us...that is superficial rich kids, not the case at all. I love how people think i have no pressure...right...try having a perfect sister, and dont think im saying it sucks, i love her more than anything in the world, but its hard to live up to such high expectations around here. im not as smart as her and i have no control of my insane temper, and im not afriad of their disapproval. It also blows when you dont have too many ""real"" friends. because in the marian world, its every girl for themself...including the people you thought would never waver, seeing as you never did. i figure if i could just move on from here i could be in less of a pergitorial state.  frustration frustration.

katrin and i composed a list of my best songs...there are 22, we cut out alot of the old or redundant ones, and ended up with 22...22...thats about 22 more than most people i know, but noone ever hears them, aside from the usual crew, and passerby that hears the chorus of aria. as i sit in my bedroom, with the door locked, pick in hand, cappo on fret, words on paper, chords in motion i soon feel home. i know that sounds indecorous but its the utmost example of the truth. to some, other people make them feel whole, or found, like one of my songs, but all i need is my music and im right where i want to be.  i dont exactly know if that is good ...or...impaired..is it bad that i dont feel like i need anyone but myself? of course i would die without my sister, and my parents and i would hate not to have friends...but when it boils down to it, i love music. not more than these people in the least, but enough so where i never feel alone, and any feeling i encounter, just goes into a song. i love recalling exactly what i was feeling and exactly what happened to evoke such a mellody, or striking phrase in a composition.  i love how people hear my songs and can apply their own meaning to it, or relate it to someone in there lives. i wish i could share it with more people but i have this accute fear of rejection when it comes to my music...i kno me right...scared of what other people think? i just donno

we get to joes and there just happens to be a guitar...the door gets locked, 4 people only in the room to hear us sing...and what does b-murda do? opens the door! and in flows 30 people, who have the pleasure of hearing ""not true""  n ""waiting"" ....it felt good to have people hear us and love it that much. they LOVED it...and my sister was having a siezure, she was so scared, i loved it ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.

today wasnt bad, last night was tho and it was HYSTARICAL, all i gotta say it ...burger king, bakersqaure, and ketchup = 45 mins of non stop laughing, katrin almost died from choking on the same piece of chicken 3 times. she also believed that something was trying to get in the car. calling people is always fun, especially when your going to be mean, katrin was ready to face her arch nemisis, and he didnt answer the phone...theres always next weekend.  but the best part is taking 45 minutes of prep time to basically do nothing...owell.  

i saw a movie with moms today...first daughter...not too surprising were its similarities to chasing liberty, but it was also very different, and i liked it compared to mandy moores rendition, odly enough i dont like katie holmes or mandy but i give katie the credit on this one.  now i cant wait for raise your voice. .lol i totally kidding!!! movies like that just make you wonder if guys like that even exist...and if they dont...why dont guys just act like it...theyd get alot more action if they were nice guys! ugh if only our lil southside abode had more guys like one played but that buffy guy in the movie, i think all of us girls here would be so much more happy wouldnt you say?

FUCK THAT. i mean it used to be like cool sister, whose more of a friend....now its LITTLE sister whom comes and must be entertained...UGH i hate it...its also very ironic that she just called, i dont kno if you read her live journal but my sister has become one of those girls we USED to LOVE to HATE together... now its like those people are her soul mates...can i get a fuck that? FUCK THAT. i mean at least last year we talked a couple times a week...now i dont even bother...im so low on the list, i dont even need to ask for this one.FUCK THAT. ugh i dont know why this perticular topic always gets to me but it does.
fuck that. im sick of being an inconvinience, when she calls, comes home, when i want to visit. maybe sisters arent ment to be friends, maybe since we became friends as children we shouldnt be friends as adults. the truth hurts, alot, but thats how it seems. i guess shes got her world and ive got mine, and theyr  as seperate as seperate can get.

"event","everything must start somewhere...this is where i begin.
my sister Linds is coming home this weekend, actually i am going to get her tomorrow shes not coming...im going...it should be fun, im excited, i hope she is too, i mean its not as exciting as going to see her beloved (as i have just found out) brian but what can ya do. anything will be better than last weekend...long story short, sitting on some roof playing with my retainor (which does resemble a clingon warship)(sorry to all you trekies i know i spelled klingon wrong...dont kill me) would have been funner...and funner isnt a word but hey i had a bad weekend so cut me some slack.  

one more day of school tho before than,... whoever said highschool was the best time of your life was incalculably mistaken.  i don't know about you but i think these pubescent years just make you want to grow up faster. its like your lungs are ready but you still cant breathe....and it bites. i can drive, and have a boyfriend, and go out to parties, but i have to be home by 11:45...it just doesnt make any sense. its purgatory, halfway there, but still incapable of autonomy. i dont kno... i just dont

my sister has a significant other at the moment... i never got that significant-major, noteworthy...other-person? so this really means noteworthy person?...im a noteworthy person...do i recieve this title? no its so close and yet so very far away...
i do not have a significant other...i have many noteworthy people in my life, but not one above all else... 
ah yes just one more thing to write a song about.

i leave you with a question...
so when its winter here its summer in australia, so is there summer break in december? so if you move there are you one grade higher? wait...do they even go to school there? WHO KNOWS?

jusqu'au temps prochain au revoir!
Ami"

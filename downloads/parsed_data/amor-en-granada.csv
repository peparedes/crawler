"event","RI = absolutely fabulous. Being home makes me happier, as Mike used to say, than a pig in sunny mud. We have adventures. Literal adventures. It's fucking rad. And sometimes it's classically rad or hill-billy rad or johnny rockets rad, but at the center of the core, it always comes down to fucking rad. Caitlin&amp;Camille&amp;LauraMarie&amp;Me. Glorious-ity.

took out some grande literature from the library too. Faust (because that women is a-coming to lecture on it), The Tao of Pooh (because I like to follow fads five years after the fact), and Marat/Sade (because I do occasionally judge a book by its cover). Dad said something I really liked today about that book. As he was holding it, he asked me, ""Don't you feel like, when you take out a book like this, that you're saving it? I mean, when was the last time someone read this book? It's just there, sitting on the shelf...I took out a book the other day, no one had taken it out in like thirty years. And it's great."" It was great. And so's the book. Which is actually a play. A really intense guillotine in your gut play. Ah Marat! And Charlotte Corday, with her lilywhite neck. The girlish assassin you'd never suspect.

Piece of advice. HUNK of advice. DO NOT PURCHASE LISTERINE DISSOLVING WHITENING STRIPS. They're fucking terrible. In the sense that they're an ENORMOUS pain in the ass. Any driplet of moisture and bam! the dissolving action kicks into high gear. And then you've got whitening gunk running amok in your lower lip. Such hassle. Crap product. Capitalism: money exchanged for goods and/or services. Fuck it up a little more, Listerine. Seriously.

I think it's time to get ready for karaoake...at snooker's. awwwwwwwwwwesome!"

"event","Whenever someone says, ""They don't make'em like that anymore"", I always want to reply, ""Sure they do. You're just not looking hard enough""<br /><br />So I've been nestled in my bed for the past week, coughing my way into <b>rock</b><b> hard <i><font size=""2"">abs! </font></i></b><font size=""2"">It's been tough. The washerboard stomach though (I must admit) is some consolation. Mum also got me new lipsticks which are applied via precision precise brush application. And I like that. I get a great shape out of my lips, but it's only when my hand stays steady like a draftswoman. That's kind of rare. But a brush helps 90% of the time. Plus the colors are really red. And I really like that. What's the use of being a scarlet woman if you can't advertise? <br /><br />School days slip away like a greased weasel now. Speaking with an old freshmen friend (he's old, the friendship's not yet), but not really speaking, more like him ticking down the days left of the semester and slightly tocking up my levels of anxiety. Spring break in two weeks, Easter break in a few after, then one zippy month then adios. 'And it'll be summahthen, thank GAWD'. <br />Thank you, God? For the May? Oh May. Frightment and Excitement. Same time, same thing. Crossing the great gulf that divides Assumption from the real world. There's still though, the need to live in the now, now. So thus. Now I suppose though I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. And then decide if I need to burn it or not. Or will they do it for me when they realize I'm not giving them any more money...? ha-ha<br /><br />I can't burn bridges. Can't burn bridges and can't let people go. Oh no oh well. I can't and I choose not to. I don't think I'd want to be able to after all things considered. Cross your fingers and kiss your elbow.<br /><br />I can hear the mice living scurrying in the walls. Country living, boy, you rest your heart but not your cheese. amen.<br /><br /><br /></font>"

"event","I will marry someone who can fly
who flows like jazz and
comes alive like Christmas
a poem, a free verse rhymenotrhyme
a morning bell, a beacon, laughter in a free land
who hears the cry of the poor and adheres
who will take my hand to pull the rest of me in
who will let me in
and never lift a head nose hair higher than mine
but will look me in the eyes
to say without saying
'how I love you, love oh love, oh how I love you you yes you, how I love always love you'"

"event","One of the funniest things I've ever read in my art history-ing was about&nbsp; Helen Frankenthaler. The excellent difference of opinion concerning her work. Particularly <i>Mountains and Sea</i> which Arthur Danto has declared to be ""as beautiful as painting gets"" while Lee Krasner proclaimed: What the fuck?! It looks like that bitch took out her tampon and wiped the canvas with it.<br /><br />woooooooooooooooooooooooooooow<br /><br />So first day being Captain Planet, well, let's be frank, it kind of sucked ass. Sweaty footballer ass. With possible signs of rash. To the 23rd degree. Absolutely brutal cold weather, relentless whipping rain and blowhard winds. In the middle of May, for fuck's sake. So of course I put all my cerebral wrinkles together this morning and decided that SHOES with fucking HOLES in them would be a smart decision. SMARTTTTTT.<br />And so sometimes, I hate myself.<br /><br />Molly ( a pure and deartrue champion of LIFE) and I stood out in this witch's-teat-cold weather for *5* hours in front of the Brown Bookstore. Armed with our dinky clipboards, spunky pins and chipper do-gooder grins. Making a bloody difference in the world. I amassed $30 in donations, wonderfully far off from the $100 minimum I need to keep my job. I amassed one pick up, and it was a damn GOOD ONE, an incredibly handsome winking brown-bearded brown-eyed boy from VT, clearly intelligent clearly hilarious and CLEARLY INTO ME. Molly may or may not have RUINED THE ENTIRE THING. May or may not have. But I enjoyed it. A sweet respite, certainly much better from the usual interaction:<br />""Hi! Do you have a minute to help fight global warming?""<br />*cue crickets*<br />or<br />""Hi! Do you have a minute to help the enviroment?""<br />'No, it's too cold out'<br />'No, I'm busy'<br />'No, I have to feed my cat'<br />'No, I have to finish my ship in a bottle kit'<br />'No, I have gas'<br />'No, I have bunions'<br />'No, I have MY HEAD UP MY ASS AHAHAHAHAA!!'<br /><br />But there were very nice people who took the time to listen to me and my fervent environmentalism. Like tall blond charmingsophisticate oldermanhandsome Christopher (Kristopher?). Who replied, ""Oh my God, you're out here in this weather? That's absolutely amazing. You know (<font size=""4"">and I did</font>)since you're so dedicated to this cause, I *will* give you a minute and more of my time"". And wow. He sure did. Fantastically. And took a brochure. Because he realized that this is damn <i>important</i>. For if we do not clean up our environmental act, RI will literally be the ocean state (lacking capitals for a very obvious and pertinent reason). It drives me out of my head, how much people simply don't don't do not do not care. Laziness coupled with selfishness. You know, the legislation we're rallying (attempting to rally) support for will employ the <u><i><b>bare minimum</b></i></u> needed to ensure we all don't diediediediedie. What is that?? Where's the action? Where's the GANAS?? Virtually no one not a one wants to listen. That's just how it goes and goes, I suppose.But in no way can I and in no way will I stop. Indifference is the most awful thing in the world, and I'd rather be Lynn Cheney&nbsp; that be that. One can<i>not</i> be all word and no action, and bugger off if you are. So thus therefore therein:<br />&nbsp;I will continue to be Captain Planet (sadly without&nbsp; the mullet...someday).<br /><strike>Except for this whole making quota thing...it smacks of selling and corporate culture. I don't know...I love what I'm doing but I don't know if I'm too mad for how I'm doing it...I don't know</strike><br /><br />Yesterday night, and I mean <i>night</i>, a dark 1:30, the house was so still and the rain was falling like music all around my windows room, <i>sparrows over birmingham</i> and memories of scott flew out of the stereo, life was so peaceful, I was so tired, and it was just the best thing ever. I had to say it out loud to myself. quietly ""<font size=""1"">this is the best thing ever</font>""<font size=""2""> And just like that, again, how happy I got. Being alive. God in Heaven, it's lovely. <br /><br /><br />Oh so, now we're all grown up and we can criticize our parents? Well fine. Just wait til you reach out your dirty hand and I say 'Oh, I'm sorry. I spent it all on the dog'<br />-r.brian fox</font>"

(I HATE typing on this laptop. HATE)

Entonces, estuve en Granada por un mes. Y what can I say about it? Twenty thousand words all rush to the forefront. The expected: beautiful, unbelievable, breathtaking, absolutely heartbreakingly soulachingly gorgeous. The negative: a trifle backASSwards, a smidge unfriendly, unfortunately patriarchal, noisy. Overall though: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Granada completely has my heart. There's music and art and wine and hippies and flowers and smart cars and fabulous hats and futbol and mountains and beer and dogs and beautiful eyes of beautiful men everywhere. Truth be told, in the beginning when I had my period but not my luggage and nothing even remotely of home with me, I was ready to kick the city and everything in it square in the face. Yet, like a bad burrito, it too did pass and now I am aprovechar-ing like a madmadmadwoman. 

Y ahora, pienso que una ducha is in order. Because I have one. Of my very own. In my single room's bathroom. Fuck yeah :-D

En final, I promeso to escribir mas. Los fotos estan en Facebook. Check them out and then tell me everything that's been going on in your lives. I miss New England the way Bill Clinton misses his dignity.

I smile more.<br />Yesterday mum and I went to Christmas Tree Shop which was absolutely fabulous. I love that place. It's like a mecca for crap you don't need but no no, you still NEED it. Case in point: we bought 12 lobster placemats. Did we need 12 lobster placemats? Were they vital to our continued existence? No. But YESSSSS!<br />I personally purchased an adorable umbrella with sunflowers on it ($2.99) and the components of a dress. By components, I mean two spools of wide shiny green ribbon and an indigo curtain. This dress is going to be pretty sweet. I can tell already. <br />Annnd Saturday night apparently was alright for fightin'. Saw an old-fashioned providence street brawl outside Finnegan's which included a kid lying in the middle of the street bleeding from his head. Good times...<br />But on a happier note, Vanessa and I went to an all-night diner in the strip club section of providence (most strip club patrons crave pancakes and omelettes after a long night of boobs-in-the-face). There, I flooded the bathroom and spoke spanish to a creepy creepy creepy creep of a man who tried to sell V and I marijuana. Which in all reality was probably marijuana and GHB. <br />The real winner of the night though was our waitress. Neither of us had change, so she ended up with a nine dollar tip. She did about four dollars worth of waitressing. That lady knows how to<em> work</em> it. <br /><br />On a chippy note of legitemacy (sp? please?), I'm slowly like a snail but surely like a star writing an actual short story. What do I have so far? Seven sentences (two of which are out of order) and a title : <em>Paul Bernardelli, Father of Three</em>. In regards to the subject, the beans will remain unspilled though. But it's something I've always been...ah, can't think of a good word. Fascinated makes me sound like an overeager anthropologist. Intrigued isn't deep enough. Involved with doesn't actually fit at all. Hmmm. Well, I think the point is gett-able though.&nbsp; But whatever now. I'm writing. So, hurray!!<br /><br />Also, 25 MORE DAYS TIL SPAIN!!!!! HEY HEY HEY, MOTHAFUCKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!<br /><br />Now I'm feeling the urge to run, Forrest, run! So up up and away I go!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I turned to pot to solve my problems, but the only thing it fixed was my life<br />~Strangers With Candy"

I got baby's first kitchen injury when I sliced my middle finger on the (appropriately titled) slicing deli machine. How? I was cleaning it improperly. Because I have no common sense. Obviously now. Thankfully the combination of my first aid training/certified expertise and the actions of Celia, my kitchen mum kept the wound and knowledge of it under control. But! The great thing is, I kept <em>on</em> cleaning the stupid thing improperly and in ignorance until the chef came by and explained that if I kept on cleaning the stupid thing improperly I would slice my wrists open and bleed to death on the kitchen floor among the fresh red onion skins and melon rinds.So he showed me how to clean the stupid thing properly. I then proceeded to clean the stupid thing properly. Then at about 9:30/10:00, the chef informed me that I was running the salad bar that day. It had to be out by 11:00. Not a problem! Then I come to find out that zero prep has been done, tins are missing, and Father Time just smoked an eight ball. But that's alright, because I love working under pressure. I really do. So I smoked an eight ball of my own in the locker room, cleaned, chopped, filled up, arranged and BAM. Salad bar's good to roll. True, it's good to roll at like 11:15, but whatever. The point is, it's rolling. Paulette and Lynn were also the biggest peaches in the world and came to my aid. God, I love that kitchen :-D<br /><br />And now, I am le exhausted. So it's off to bed with <em>The Silmarillion</em> because I AM A HUGE NERD. And it's delicious. What? Yes. <br />This heat makes me feel like a pudding.

Yet why be negative and only concentrate on things that incur the need to dropkick useful animals? 
God Bless America and God Blessed this 4th of July holiday. I was fortunate enough to see two long and glorious firework shows. One of them was right lakeside. The other one...I was high! Which really enhanced the show. Honestly, what better thing can you watch when you're baked? What's better than enormous,prolonged bursts of luminous color and sound in the sky? With teriyaki chicken in one hand and a twisted tea in the other (girly but DELICIOUS)? It all adds up to a spankin' good time.
Finally being able to hang out with Vanessa was probably the most fantastic thing about the weekend.I hardly get to see her which is grossly lame. She really is a sister more than a cousin, and I love her uber dearly. Spending a rocking rollicking holiday with her was more than marvelous. 
Adventures (yes, they are adventures) like these are great waker-uppers (yes, this is acceptable grammar). My friends from Home are admittedly few and far between. But what does that matter when they're friends? Beautiful, wonderful, tried and true friends? Sure, my weekend life here is a far cry from Assumption. No wild and crazy Smithfield parties do I hit up. Why the hell would I want to though when 99.999998% of the people there are complete jackasses? It would be high school yet again, high school in all its narrow minded, money grubbing, status symbol, cunt rag glory. Fuck that completely. Home is home is home and yes, what I do here is almost a complete 180 from what I do at Assumption, but I'm still living my  own life in my own way. It's beautiful. A different kind, but still beautiful. Very very much so, to be sure. And I love it. The end.

The World Cup final is going to be France vs. Italy.(my prediction was an utter Wrong Call) Still shall be a kick ARSE match though. The entire tournament has been truly great, and I know this game will be The Crowning Moment. World Cup Championship, kids. CHAMPIONSHIP!!!!
Italy's got my support all the way too. Although, I'm a big <3-er of Zidane, the French captain. That dude is just woooah. Unbelievable player. Unbelievable name too. Zinedine Zidane. Sexy!

I will fly about on an umbrella, care for and about and open a world of wonder for two small children, and furthermore birds will flock to me in abundance with sweet serenades pouring out of their warbling throats. 
I think it's going to be pretty bitching, personally.

Also, I'm muy excited over the fact that tomorrow I will have some company as I shout at the TV screen! USA vs. Ghana! The little chickabidees are just as pumped for the game as I am, which warms the very depths of my heart. This an extremely important game too. Well, pretty much every game the USA plays is important but this one is up there. Trust me. If we lose this, we're out. If we tie this, we're out. We need a win. NEED. As well as score a jing-bang load of goals. JING-BANG. And then we need Italy to win. NEED. 
Before I go to work tomorrow, I am sacrificing two of my choicest oxen in order to secure this victory. I suggest...no, I PLEAD with you all to do the same. SOLIDARITY, SAM'S ARMY!!!


But my last day of nothing all day was quite lovely. I lounged in bed reading ""The Once and Future King"" (FANTASTIC book. Go read it. NOW. It's hilarious, incredibly intelligent,wise and breathtakingly lovely. Read it right aways.). Made a trip to the library, this time for some movies and music. World Cupped with Poppa and Ryan Fox. Saw an extensively handsome photo of Stephen Colbert which is coincidentally now my new desktop background(what can I say...I like'em dark haired&eyed,hilariously brilliant, and middle-aged). Found a beautiful white tiny tin with the word LOVE in silver with scrollwork. Helped a wonderful friend. Wrote some lovely verses. Felt peaceful and sweet with life.

135 nations signed the global warming treaty; we didn't. We didn't. We wonder why the world thinks we're arrogant. Ha! 135 nations signed the treaty. We go, 'Hey! Go fuck yourselves! We don't give - suck on our shit!'

"event","It was a NY LI weekend. So much Fox Family. Literally. From every part of the Union. Furthermore. I bought an outfit for $8. I am a shopping champion.

But let's review Thursday night

Booze

Couch gymnastics
""You've had a threesome?""
Booze
That dude who had a kid...no wait...that KID who had a KID (WHAAAT)
Spit + three story building + gravity = I want to rethink my pursuit of studies
Pilfering cigarettes
Booze
Gratuitous photos of sloppity-slopness in action
Swooping bites ripping out enormous hunks of an unsuspecting, raw pineapple
...Booze?...Booze

I can't paint my nails. All I do is smudge smudge smudge. And have to blow my nose. A LOT. 

My toe ring is a complete paradox. In order for it to stay on my toe and not slip off suddenly! whilst I am walking, I have to tighten it. To the point of cutting off circulation in my toe. Which, in the end, will inevitably cause me to lose my toe. HOWEVER, not to tighten it verociously would result in the loss of my toe ring. And I may as well just cut off my toe than have it be toe-ringless. Especially this toe ring. Oh, it is fabulous. Take my word on it. Fa-bu-lousssss. 

I've been writing so much lately. And allllll of it sucks. Yay! I'm going to take my dad's advice and take up plumbing. After all,I do have a way with stubborn leaky sinks. And a gorgeous ass crack. Oh yes. Simply gorgeous.

Ugh. I just killed a bug. I'm going to bed.







Hey, son, you know how you've been bugging me to go and get you a puppy? Well, today after work, I went out and I bought you one. But on the way home, I got hungry and I ate him! I'm joking; I'd never buy you a puppy

"event","The Senate has rejected the ban on gay marriage. The Republicans fell one short of the majority vote they had expected (49-48). 7 Republicans voted against the amendment, including Lincoln Chaffee (I feel so represented and lovely). Of course, Those Who Lost had a few things to blather on about
""We were hoping to get over 50 percent, but that didn't happen today,"" said Sen. David Vitter, R-La., one of the amendment's supporters. ""Eventually, Congress is going to have to catch up to the wisdom of the American people or the American people will change Congress for the better.""
        Unquestionably, Vitter has his two fingers pressed into the pulse of the American people.  He truly knows what the American people want. Regardless of the fact he supports an amendment that dehumanizes a vast section of the American people.
""We're not going to stop until marriage between a man and a woman is protected,"" said Sen. Sam Brownback R-Ka
         How splendid and heartwarming it is to see a politician that sticks to his guns. You keep on fighting your good fight. Honestly. Cheers, fuckface!


   George Bush has stated that all immigrants must adopt American values and speak English in order to live in the United States. Adopt American values? What a delightfully arrogant statement. If it isn't American, it's barbaric? No other country abides by the rational, honorable, and humanitarian laws that we do? Before people come to this country they are depraved, murderous, cruel deviants? And such pressure to learn English! All this focus on assimilation! Fantastic! Who cares about honoring and preserving the beauty of one's heritage and history? Once you're American, nothing else matters! Just like Lou Dobbs said, the only flag that should be waved in this country is the American flag. The only language spoken should be English. Who honestly cares that within a matter of years Hispanics will comprise the majority population of the USA? I know I don't. I already speak English. And so will they. 

Ridiculous. I'm going to go read a book now.



The reality behind the mystery is simply that we are doing what we want to do. Period.

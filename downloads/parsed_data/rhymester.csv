"event","A Very Important Question:

If you were going to make banana cupcakes, which tasty frosting would you use?

 1) Cream cheese frosting, possibly with some caramel drizzled on it

 2) Caramel buttercream, possibly also with caramel drizzled on

 3) Honey-cinnamon buttercream, no caramel

I must say I'm intrigued by this honey-cinnamon idea, which has the benefit of not being tooth-achingly sweet, but I'm bringing them for a large group of people, and I want to pick one that will go over well.


Thoughts?"

Of course, this is most likely due to the fact that I've been working the night shift at the ER for a month and don't get time to eat. But also due to the working out.

Have I mentioned that I hate the night shift?

And have I also mentioned that ""My five-year-old vomited twice today"" is NOT an emergency? And does not require a visit to the emergency room? Nor is ""I think she has an ear infection"" or ""his nose has just been really runny and he has a cough."" Not emergencies. That is what the doctor's office is for, folks. As much as I love general pediatrics, I'm starting to get sick of providing emergency room primary care."

I hope everybody had a splendid New Year's Eve last night, however you chose to celebrate it. I continued a tradition of fancy restauranting with my husband and a couple of our dear friends, and drank champagne late into the night. Oh, and I met Lydia Bastianich, which was fangirly and special. I do heart my celebrity chefs.

Resolutions for the coming year include but are not limited to:

1. Losing weight. I regained pretty much all of what I lost three years ago, so it's back on the wagon for me. I was given a gift of 12 personal training sessions for Christmas, and I'm really looking forward to using them. 

2. Posting more. This LJ went from near daily postings of whatever, to frantic postings about exams, to cricket-chirping silence. I don't really want it to be any of those things, so I have to think about how I'd like to restructure it.

3. Remembering to call my grandmothers at least once a week. It's important.

4. Getting in touch with old friends. I think I need to send out some long emails to people I've basically lost contact with. If I want to restart those friendships, I can't just wait for them to call. After all, it goes both ways.

Four is enough, I think. For now. We'll see how I do."

It's been a flurry of frantic planning and so much chaos; we had a photographer quit, we had to fire a florist, we had to buy crockpots for soup at the last minute, all the little things just kept adding up! But for the most part it's all done. Now I just have to show up next week.

Wow.

Of course, this is all tinged by the fact that I have to have my residency application finished before then. It must be done by Tuesday the 8th, which is when I go home, but I'll be busy bacheloretting it up this weekend, so that's not a lot of days left. Personal statement continues to kick my ass, and it's holding me back. Hopefully a meeting with the Dean today will help with that a bit.

I'm looking forward to actually carrying my own weight, and really taking over half of the service, but for last night, it was nice. I even got a little bit of sleep, since nobody called me between about 1 and 4am.

And then I came home at 10am, and I meant to sleep until about 4pm. And I slept until 6. I think the plan in the future needs to be getting things done as soon as I get home, because I was actually functional then, and then napping to my heart's content.

I still need to work on making decisions without checking everything with my senior resident first. I'm still asking about most things, and I'm at a place where I need to start having some confidence in my clinical judgment.

In fact, I'm alive, and I'm a fourth year now. Can you believe it? I finished up my third year with a whirlwind five weeks of OB/Gyn, which was actually very interesting, despite my serious case of senioritis at the end of the year.

And now I'm I sub-intern (Sub-I)! I'm working at the children's hospital, and I'm essentially an intern for the next month. I have all the responsibilities of an intern, except I'm not allowed to take call by myself or write prescriptions. For some patients, in other words, I'm their primary doctor while they're in the hospital. 

It's amazing. I've gone from writing notes and studying for tests to answering pages from nurses when patients have fevers or can't breathe. I'm making decisions and using clinical judgement in ways I never have before. And yes, I have supervision (thank goodness) but I'm really learning how to do it on my own.

"event","As this is the last weekend of my vacation, I naturally had to celebrate with some cupcake creations.

I decided to try something a little more complicated than usual, so I made some cupcakes that I'd seen on one of my favorite cupcake websites (yes, I have several) <a href=""http://howtoeatacupcake.net/"">How to Eat a Cupcake</a>. You should check out the site, by the way. It's excellent, and all recipes are sorted by cupcake and also by frosting recipe. 

I'd never made a fully cooked swiss meringue buttercream before, and I wasn't sure how it would come out. I'd always made the easier butter-and-confectioner's sugar fake buttercreams. Well, no longer. This was amazing.

I'd also never made caramel from scratch before. I'm so glad it worked.

And so, without further ado, I present: 

<lj-cut text=""Brown sugar vanilla cupcakes with salted caramel swiss meringue buttercream (and caramel drizzle)"">


The prep - just after putting the dry ingredients in the mixer. That bowl is full of home made caramel.

The cupcakes themselves, just out of the oven

And after adding the icing! The icing has about half of the caramel mixed in, with some additional caramel drizzled over it.

"event","Ok, friends. I have a dilemma, and I need your help.


My real, legal name is Barbara (Middle Name) (Last Name). Lorrie is a nickname I have gone by since day one. No one I know has <b>ever</b> called me Barbara, except by accident, usually on the first day of school. Lorrie is not my middle name (though they have similarities). I am named after my mother and my grandmother. My grandmother does not care whether I like my name (""Oh, honey, you'll always be my little Lor-Lor"") but my mother does. A lot (""When I christened you in honor of our family..."").

I have never made a secret of being much fonder of Lorrie than of Barbara. In fact, I have hated the name Barbara since I was very small. This makes my mother sad. I love the name Lorrie. It is who I am.

So here's the problem:

Every etiquette book ever written says that on my wedding invitation my name must read ""Barbara (Middle Name)"". This is what my mother wants. This will not happen. Nobody will know whose wedding it is.

I say, screw the etiquette books. I want Lorrie in there. I'd really prefer to put just Lorrie.

However, we are writing out Martin's whole name. My mother is furious, and we've already had a huge fight over it.

So the possible compromises are

-Barbara Lorrie     
and
-B. Lorrie

I still like Lorrie alone, but now I'm beginning to wonder if that will look a little *too* informal. In my big blow-up fight with my mother, I said that I don't care whether it looks informal or not, but now I'm not so sure. Would the invitations look better if the whole thing is formal and the name is too? Would one informal name just stand out as weird? Keep in mind that the wording of the whole invite is formal (my mother will not budge on this) so it's going to be: 

""Mr. and Mrs. (Dad's name) (Last Name) request the honor of your presence and the marriage of their daughter (My Name) to (Martin's full name).

Frankly, I don't think I should have to compromise on this one, and I won't. But I'm now unsure of what *I* want to do.

So I ask you: Lorrie, B. Lorrie, Barbara Lorrie?

What do I do?"

"event","Looking at my LJ, I realize it's become mostly a conduit for my twitters for the past few months. I have to be better about updating.

But here's the long and short of it. 

Third year is almost over. All I have left is 5 weeks of OB/Gyn. (Vacation right now, woohoo!) And I'm going into Pediatrics when it's all over. I want to work with teenagers, so I'm heading toward adolescent medicine, and thinking about programs that have a good adolescent practice. Columbia and Mt Sinai spring to mind.

Of course, there's no vacation between third and fourth year, so when my killer sub-internships start in July, I'll be even busier than I am now. But in September I get to take a break. And get marrried!

That's the state of the Lorrie right now. I promise to start writing much less serious and more frequent posts in the near future. Probably starting this afternoon.

That is all."

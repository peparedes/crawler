"event","Ugh i hate chicago, and this university is an awful place for anyone. The environment is so intense...so intense that we have to have a suicide prevention day (we get the day off) on campus. WTF. 

Last quarter was awful...I did horribly and was sexually harrassed...it got so bad that we had to bring it up to the head of our department. 

i made really good friends with this one chick...basically our friendship is what got me through the last quarter (which was awful), and all of a sudden she has stopped talking to me and is being totally mean. Won't tell me what's up, so i've had to try and make other friends. This is fine, i guess, but it makes it difficult when someone is in your program and in the same room as you and is ignoring your existence. Not only awkward for me, but for everyone else in the room. Given that our friendship was the only thing holding my sanity in check, I now have no outlet for the craziness that is UChicago and i'm currently having a hard time with things. 

In other news,  I was one of 30 people in the country and one of 9 people amongst those peoples chosen for an internship with the DIA. I'm going to be working at US central command in Tampa, FL for 10 weeks and get paid for it! With that money i plan on flying to europe, then flying out to the middle east for a month before school starts. That's the tentative plan at least...I'm not sure when i'll be back in california. 

They flew me out to DC for security interviews and i stayed at a luxury hotel for a while...they paid me to be there...for everything...giving me $70 a day to spend on food. I probably got about $1,000 out of it, just going there. I got stuck in the HUGE blizzard and had to stay for an extra three days, which wasn't that bad given the fact that i was stuck in a hotel room that was $650 a night. 

This quarter is a little better than the previous one, despite my friend's odd behavior. I'm taking the following classes:
-Intermediate Persian
-Islamic History: The Middle Period
-Hannah Arendt

My fav is the class on Arendt...

Next quarter I'm taking the following classes:
-Intermediate Persian
-Islamic History: 1750-Present
-The Cultural Consequences of Colonialism. 

anyway, that's just a little update on my life...hope you're all doing well."

"event","hey peeps 

Life in Chicago has been all right so far, but it definitely doesn't feel like i'm in school. I don't feel challenged in the least bit. It feels like i'm at sleep-away camp living in cabins spread out amongst Hyde Park. 

I'm taking the following classes this quarter:
-Approaches to Studying the Middle East
-History of Early Islam through the Caliphates
-Intermediate Persian

Persian is the only interesting one. 

I've been making friends here, which is good. The people in my program are nice people. The actual program itself is easy...they all are asking for 2 page papers all the time. ugh. 

anyway...i'll update more later. I'm going up to Wheaton to see my friend (from Israel/UCLA) and hopefully we're going to go see Tolkien's writing desk, CS Lewis' wardrobe, etc...i'm excited!"

"event","so i've arrived in chicago...and though the trip started off fun, when my mother left it pretty much went downhill. 

Basically here's the spread...hyde park is the most boring place on earth. Not only is it boring, but it's creepy to walk around by yourself after dark. Everything effectively closes around 8pm, so it makes late night strolls unnecessary anyway. So this means that all your stuff needs to be done during the day, and as i'm used to getting everything i need to get done at night (such as shopping, chores, etc), there's a lot of getting used to out here. 

The people are all very nice for the most part. Hyde Park is almost exclusively black, the white population basically being affiliated with the university somehow. Though there's no visible race wars going on, you don't need to be a genius to see that there's the outlines of social segregation...i can feel it. 

As for the school itself, there is only one word to describe the student population: NERDS. I'm talking the absolute archetypal nerd. The men have glasses, are extremely pale, afraid of women, and hang out in the library. The women are no better. No one around here hangs out, goes to parties or does anything other than school. This goes for both the undergraduate and the graduate populations. School hasn't even started yet and people are already off to the library to start studying for their classes that won't start for another week and a half. 

majors aren't called majors here...they are called concentrations....hell week is called a 'reading period' and..they call fall, autumn. aghhhhhhh

I feel quite out of my element. I didn't think that this school would be a breeze, but i also thought that what i was hearing was merely hyperbolic. Nope, it's all true. It's like i've entered a twilight zone where everyone is a studying robot. The funny thing is that not many of them can make whatever theyre learning applicable...at least, this is my observation. many of them could not survive outside academia. 

you guys have no idea how unbelievably quiet everything is...and it's not because there are no students here...because there ARE. The school is majority grad students (10,000 grad 3,500 undergrad); so, they all are just real quiet. The people in my apartment building are in their apartments but i've only seen a few people total in a whole week.. It creeps the shit out of me...the whole thing. No social skills...the lot of them. 

i should have applied and went to ucla...rather than trying to go for the prestige."

"event","i'm moving to chicago on thursday morning and will stay there for 2 years...and haven't quite packed yet. 

so naturally, i'll be spending my last precious hours updating livejournal.

So what's up with me? 

well...i spent most of this summer playing in musical shows for a community theater. I did a 6 week run of ""My Fair Lady"" then a 6 week run of ""West Side Story""...this took up every single weekend for my whole summer. The latter show was really trying...the Reed book required that i play 9 instruments and the music was EXTREMELY catchy. 

The other days of my summer were taken up by a horribly misdiagnosed case of mono which developed into secondary hepatitis. First they thought i had swine flu, then it was gastroenteritis..so i ended up taking tamiflu and last-resort antibiotics at the same time, resulting in extreme nausea, jaundice, and an enlarged spleen. When i wasn't at the theater i was sleeping in bed...i literally just read and slept every single day...sometimes never leaving bed. 

Toward the end of the summer i went on a cruise to celebrate my graduation from UCLA. Went to Key West, Cozumel/Playa del Carmen, and Belize. It was awesome and i attribute my getting 100% better to those relaxing days i spent on the boat, treking through jungles, and spying on mayan ruins. 

My downtime also allowed me to get into several tv shows...including ones that i couldn't keep up with while i was in school. I'm caught up with True Blood...and a bunch of comedy ones that i watched halfheartedly. 

I got really into Merlin, Kings, and Legend of the Seeker. 

<b>Merlin</b>, although definitely not quality programming, has it's own certain charm to it...i keep on watching it, even though i'm not really THAT into it. Merlin is dopey and lame at everything except for magic, gwen is ethnic, uther is a tyrant, arthur is a douche...but Morgana is spot on. I want her to turn evil already. The thing that pisses me off the most about this show is that someone is in mortal peril in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. The last few episodes of this series more than made up for the other episodes...but it still hardly compares in quality to many of my other fav shows. 

<b>Kings</b> was my favorite show on television...until it got canceled. It took place in an alternate universe where countries were ruled by kings. The whole thing is a huge biblical allegory to the story of David's rise to the throne and is SO well-done that you'd think you're watching a movie. The production value was extremely high...the pilot cost 4 million to make and each subsequent episode cost 1 million. NBC NEVER advertised it, so no one watched it...no one i know really has heard of it. It's more of a royal court drama taking place in the modern era than anything. You can't really sense the biblical stuff...but even when you can, it's done in such a brilliant way that you want to read the bible to get spoilers for the show :P  

<b>Legend of the Seeker</b> is my new favorite show. It's like a mix between Xena/Hercules and Lord of the Rings and it's based off of the ""Sword of Truth"" series by Terry Goodkind. It's filmed in New Zealand and the people that work on the show ARE the same people who worked on LOTR. It tells the story of three people: Richard, who finds out he is the first  Seeker in 1,000 years and is destined to rid the world of the influence of evil; Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander, a wizard of the first order who trains Richard along the way; and the Mother Confessor, the leader of an ancient group of women with the power to see if people are telling the truth and who can 'confess people' (essentially make people her slaves)...she serves truth and upholds justice and is the highest moral authority in the midlands. Though it's about fighting against evil, it really is a love story and it's very beautifully done. You feel for the two main characters as they fall deeper and deeper in love, but can never act on it because of who they are magically. My favorite character is Kahlan, the mother confessor, because she's so beautiful, feminine, and just... yet is extremely dangerous and has this dark, uncontrollable side. I think about the show often and i want someone else to WATCH it so that i can talk to them about it! I'm going to buy a couple of the books today.   

Anyway...i better get started on my day!"

here's a summary:

-DRAMA over whether i could graduate or not...turns out i essentially did last quarter..wtf@my counselor. 
-Dropped FILM in 6th week because of the retarded unit cap rule at UCLA
-After attending the career fair 3 weeks ago, i received a cryptic phone call telling me that i got an interview for a graduate internship. The interview went really well, and i got a tentative offer pending favorable results of an SSBI and a polygraph testing my answers to all the forms i have to fill out. hope i get it...it's good money ($18-$26/hour)
-Saw my first movie, ""Star Trek,"" today in the movie theater since ""The Golden Compass"" when i was in Israel...mainly because i had a free ticket at my disposal, not because i especially wanted to see it.

Some updates on my life....

I've lost more weight, but i haven't been weighing myself (because i'll know that i'll get obsessive)...people are starting to comment which is great. I have a lot more work to do, but i figured that over the summer, that is, when i'll have more time, i can focus 100% on exercising. I'm almost down to the weight i was before i left for israel (about 35lbs less than i was in August :DDD). 

anyway, classes have been rough in regards to attendance, seeing as how i'm in classes most days of the week 9-5pm which leaves me in want/need of a nap when i get home and only a few hours for hw; however, my classes are SO fucking awesome this quarter that there's no way i'm dropping any of them. Here's my schedule:

-Persian 1C
-International Relations of the Middle East
-History of American Film
-Symphonic Band
-European Jewish History from 1881 to present. 

The classes themselves aren't killing me, but those stupid ass SECTIONS are killing me. The teachers are making attendance for them mandatory. 

Now my film class is definitely my favorite class...it meets in an on-campus MOVIE THEATER...it's actually the best movie theater i've ever been in and the teacher has amazing taste in film! THe lectures themselves are equally as amazing...the class is 4 hours long twice a week not including an hour section...but i just don't get tired of it. i always leave feeling like i want more :-) I'm glad i didn't take this class when i first went to UCLA, lest i change my major to film!

If any of you guys are visiting me, i'll take you to my class to see a movie...it's DEFINITELY worth the experience."

that reminds me...i don't remember if i wrote this in my last entry or not (too lazy to check), but i was rejected from GWU....found out it was becasue i didn't fulfill the economics prereqs (micro and macro); so they didnt even look at my app. Whatever....i told my mom that even if i received a full scholarship from them, i wouldn't go...because chicago is ranked like 50 places higher than GWU."

"event","i'm not so sure anymore what i'm going to do with my life. 

I've been contemplating both med school and law school. i'm not sure...for some reason i have this urge to go to chicago after my masters..northwestern or u of chicago..i dont know if i could handle the cold, but it seems like such an awesome place and a complete change. 

If i decide on law school, then i'll go through with the MA program...if i decide on med school, i will turn down offers and have to either move in with my parents for a year or with my grandma for a year, then go to community college to fulfill the prereqs...at best i wouldn't be going until i'm 25 and won't be finished until i'm in my early 30's...eh i really need to figure out if this is what i want!

i figured if i get into all the schools i'm accepted to for the MA, i would go to either university of chicago or georgetown...i dont think that even if i got in that i would go to john hopkins sais, GWU, or columbia...i wish i would have figured more of myself out earlier :-/ but i REALLY hate econ and i don't want to do any more of it if i don't have to. This microecon class is going to bring down my GPA this quarter as it is and i wont be able to graduate cum laude, all for something that i took just to be able to get into GWU and SAIS. ugh.  

on this note, i hear from university of chicago next week (which i'm almost positive will be a  rejection) and the rest of the schools throughout march. 
 
I really don't know guys..i don't even want to go into these programs any more, but i feel as if i'm obligated because i spent so much money in applying for them. I wish i could go back in time and have 4 years knowing what i know now. I'm embarassed at myself and wish that i would have given my future more thought and figured if this is something i REALLY wanted to do :-/

somehow i managed a B on my M.E. history 1300-1700CE midterm...i'm not sure how since he asked for specific names AND dates AND battles...somehow i remembered that the Hijra (migration from mecca to medina) took place in 622CE (or the year 1 in the Islamic calendar) and a lot of other random crap...i didn't really study and just had a general outline of the material. hmm...whatever...it just means that i can still pull an A in the end if i ace the essay final (which i will because i'm awesome like that). 

I also would like to announce that i lost 2 lbs in 5 days...making my weightloss at almost 1/2 lb a day! I've been counting calories and exercising a lot...and you guys have no idea how much better i feel! in the week before i also lost 2 lbs...next week i'm aiming for 3lbs, so i guess i have to step up the cardio a notch. I'm trying to keep my calorie count constant though--1,200-1,500 calorie intake a day--which means not eating less, but just eating foods with lower calories. I figured that to maintain my weight (and also not exercise) i would need to have around a 2,800 calorie intake. (which is somewhere around 17,000 calories a week)...

if you all remember nutrition 101...1 lb=3,500 calories...so to lose just one lb i need to have 3500 less than 17,000. crazy how math can be useful like this eh?

I was just tutoring my cousin today..i took her to starbucks and we did all of her math hw and some of her french hw. my aunt made me spinach ravioli, salad, and garlic bread and her and i talked about all the crazy stuff i used to do as a kid...i remember wehn she was babysitting me deliberately leaving the front door ajar then running and hiding under the bed...my aunt thought i was kidnapped and i stil don't think she got over the shock that i put her through...heh...my cousins were enjoying the stories and i even got to helping natalie out a little bit with her trumpet..i'm only supposed to be there an hour a week..but i'm there 3-4 hours...i certainly brought some life and happiness into that house that wasn't there a few weeks ago...

i think that hell has frozen over...aubry is good with..children??! aubry would be a good mother??!?! aubry can solve 75% of a family's problems in just 2 weeks?!? wtf is going on with this world!?!?!

wow life is weird right now..i feel as if i'm at a turning point..a turning point toward a big (and great) change in my life. weee"

"event","Life has been difficult these past few months but my stress is almost over. I have 2 grad school applications left, and this quarter is over in a month. This was probably one of the crappier quarters i've had, simply because i have no love for my classes. Maybe it's a case of senioritis or something, but I really don't feel like putting my heart into it. None of it will count anyway, seeing as how all my colleges will just be looking at my Fall GPA and everything prior to that in making an admissions decision. 

Well, my ceiling is cracking open and water has been pouring out of it for like 2 days now. Kinda funny and kinda ghetto...but i dunno...the ghetto-ness of this place makes it a little more home-y to me. :P

I've been feeling really in the mood these past few weeks to start dating seriously again. The last time i seriously dated must have been a few years ago, the last time i was 'with' someone was 7 months ago, and the last time i actually had a boyfriend was almost 3 years ago next month. I have the feeling right now though that no one will want me until i lose a few more pounds. So, i've been putting it off until i feel that i've had a sufficient amount of weight loss...i just feel so lonely lately...it doesn't help that my grandma is continually mentioning to me dating this guy or that guy and asking when i'm going to get a bf...you know what, i'll get a bf when i meet a guy who is NOT an asshole! haha (impossible). 

honestly though...i feel trapped in a body that isn't mine and i've been working really hard to get the weight off...i hate how the process is so slow though...i guess it was slow coming on, so it'll be slow coming off. I've been limiting my calorie intake to about 1200-1500 a day, and have been trying to get at least 1 hour of cardio in (jogging/power walking) a day. I've been doing ok--losing about 2 lbs a week...ehhh can we fast-forward to 3-4 months from now???"

It's just that things all seem to be happening at the same time...every time i try to solve a problem, then like 5 new ones pop up. It's bullshit. 

Because of this stupid budget crisis, one of the classes i need to take in order to graduate was cancelled...this means that either i have to petition for one of my hebrew university classes to count or take a graduate class in order to graduate in june. 

i'm currently filling out a petition for chair review for a class that i thought would easily transfer. My counselor is brand new and retarded when it comes to the middle east, and the chair is a sub for the real chair (whom i know and like) who is a visiting professor at oxford this year...apparently this new one is a hard ass, so i have to be very persuasive in my writing. I'm so fucked if i can't get credit for it...Aubry will be graduating in the summer :-/

I ran out of money today...I'm not sure what I should do because I still need to pay for $200 worth of college applications this month on top of more transcript expenses. I'm so fucking screwed becasue i'm still $55 behind on my cell phone bill. I was so careful with my money too...even though i had little money for food, gas, and having fun before, now things are 5 times worse. I feel like crying...i don't know what to do because i can't ask my parents for money and i def don't have the time to juggle a job in all of this. I can use my credit card, but i know that i won't be able to completely pay it off until the end of the school year...and i'll have no money for next month :-(

well today was neither...just another day in my life. Life doesn't seem too bad right now--i mean, by many peoples' standards what's going on now with me is bad, but i think that i'm happy :-)

School is not so bad now that i dropped Hebrew conversation...it seemed like a lot of work, and i'm already all right at the language (i knew all the vocab words)...i just didn't have time to memorize the videos (yes, you heard me right...MEMORIZE line by line 10 minutes videos every week). I'm jsut worried about my microeconomics class...it seems easy enough but i'm lost because there's like 500 people in my class and 30 people in my TA section...i suppose i could go to office hours but i'm going to try to wing it. My Ottoman history class is so easy that i can just do the reading without going to class...plus i don't want to hear an israeli expatriate anti-zionist speak about the palestinian cause anymore. it's a freakin' OTTOMAN HISTORY class...that only goes up to 1800! Persian is all right...i'm pretty much guaranteed an A. 

As for symphonic band, i auditioned and i got principal oboe, along with all the english horn solos :-D

I have my Georgetown application due on friday. Friday night i'm going to hillel for dinner/improv comedy night...and saturday i'm going to my great aunt's funeral (my grandma's brother's wife).

Finished my University of Chicago application--it seemed to have turned out okay. I reread my statement of purpose and recoiled a bit, but there's nothing i can do about it now. At least now I have somewhat of a blueprint for writing my other essays. blergh. I was hoping to use this break to study some more persian but it seems that i haven't enough time for anything. I'm not getting much sleep again too, and i don't think it helped when my stepdad was working on his miata at 630am until about 1130am. ugh. 

I feel like i don't have much to look forward too at this point...at least until i get the results of my applications and scholarships. Im not optimistic, but i'm hoping that i'll at least get in somewhere. 

Other than that, not much to report. I haven't really left te house much these past few weeks other than just the odd trip to the store and such. Here's to wishing the next year is even more awesomer than the last!

I finally got somewhat of a diagnosis of what has been wrong with me this past year...turns out after a shit load of tests the doctor came up with IDS, though what kind of IDS he's not exactly sure of. This is better than a bullshit diagnosis of 'gastroentritis' which is essentially means that i have a bad tummy ache that has something to do with my gastrointestinal tract. Anyway, IDS, or Irritiable Bowel Disease has two subcategories...the first of which is Chrohn's Disease and the second of which is ulcerative colitis. Apparently it's genetic and common in the Ashkenazi jewish community. so thanks mom and dad for this one. 

I'm going on medication and the doctor recommended for me a 'bland diet'...no spicy foods, no coffee, no soda, nothing with too much taste. FUCK THAT SHIT. I'm going to eat what i want and when i want it!

Outside of that revelation, I am happy to report my grades for this quarter:
Middle East History 500-1300: A
Symphonic Band: A
Persian 1A: A
Scandinavian Folklore: A

That makes it a 4.0! :-O 

FYI I've gotten several 4.0's in my life, but i'd never thought that i could get it at UCLA. I worked my ass off this quarter, because just getting a B in UCLA classes is tough. I think I only got 3 A's total for the 06-07 school year the rest being B+'s or B's..this sure brought my GPA up though...it's now .2 higher which is crazy. Anyway, i'm quite proud of myself for once, and my mom even said that she was surprisingly happy about it."

"event","i hate these stupid essays i have to write for my history class..they're so easy and obvious thati just don't feel like doing them. The last one i wrote was like done the same day it was due and i got the second highest grade a (94%) out of a class of 175. Are people retarded? Honestly i'm not THAT intelligent or THAT good at essays comparably to the rest of the UCLA population...

regardless, it's due on thursday (the 20th).

I took my persian test yesterday and i was really pissed off afterwards, because the teacher included words on there that weren't on the study guide or in the book. She like essentially hinted the answers to me (a la Mrs Rav 9th grade),  but still...that wasn't fair. Also what wasnt fair is that persian is spoken differently than it's read, and when she was doingthe dictation portion she was speaking colloquially which is easy for the natives, but i really had to think about it hard and sort of guesstimate. lame. 

I went to an essay writing thing last night that helps us out with our personal statement for grad school...it was for jews only, which was weird, but it was extremely extremely helpful. I'm actually sort of excited to write my statements of purpose!

Something that's scaring me is that for most of the programs i'm applying to the average age of acceptance is like 27...this scares the shit out of me. Though i have more experience in the field than most people my age, i definitely don't have solid work experience in the field for years on end. My only plus is that i worked for a israeli governmental think tank org for 6 months. not that impressive compared to people who have like 3 internships like that, plus  years of work experience. I know the profiles of those accepted, because i was perusing through facebook groups"

"event","I haven't posted on here since monday or so, but i've got to say that the past week was perhaps the longest week of my life. There was so much fucking drama i don't really want to go into it too much, but i will say that i'm so glad that it's all over. 

I did not leave my room the whole week unless it was to go to class or to take a shower. 

I submitted my scholarship application to the state departmetn, and i think that it's really really really good. I had Tracy look it over, and help me work out the kinks and i am happy with the final result. I won't hear about the results until late march 2009, but i mean it's one less thing for me to worry about right now. 

This week is going to not be much better. It's going to be filled with more GRE studying on top of a test in persian on monday, a midterm essay in history due thursday, and a group project also due on thursday. I have to sign up for spring classes, ration my food, and start on my college apps. I think i'm pretty sure which schools i'm applying to:

-Georgetown: security studies focus in Middle East and terrorism/substate violence
-GWU: Security policy studies focus in terrorism/substate violence and intelligence
-John Hopkins U: Strategic Studies--using persian as language of study.
-U of Chicago: Joint degree in Middle Eastern Studies and Public Policy (2 degrees!)
-Boston U: International Relations and Religion (focus in M.E.)
-Columbia: Islamic Studies (liberal arts degree...no GRE required)
-IDC Herzlyia (in Israel): Government with a focus in Counterterrorism

Of these schools one is a reach (John Hopkins), 3 are slight reaches (Georgetown, U of Chicago, Columbia), 2 are matches (GWU and Boston U), and one is a safety (IDC). I'm trying to look into applying to another safety school...any suggestions? 

OH and the world meltdown is continuing...Japan, the world's 2nd largest economy, is officially in a recession. It's crazy how the policies of just one country's president (ie GW Bush) can sufficently bring the world down to its knees. I am proud to say that I never voted for him, because i KNEW what a mistake it was the first time that someone like that got elected...and i imagined that he could only make things worse. The good thing from all this is that it is the beginning of the end of the neocons adn also the beginning of the end of the power of the religious right. THANK (my) G-D!!!"

"event","I took the GRE today and did abysmal on the english section and better than i thought on the math (i improved it by 200 points in just a few weeks)...my essays were really really good...i really worked hard on them. Most of the schools i'm applying for have average scores of around 150-200 points higher than my score...though i know my essay score is going to be way above average. I emailed all the schools i'm applying to with my stats and my score and asking them whether or not they think that i should bother taking it again for a few hundred more points or if i should just suck it up and hope that everything else balances it out. If they recommend me to take it again i'll buy another test book and study my ass off and take it the 1st. 

I just want to go to college...why does it have to be so expensive and WHY do they try to put so many obstacles in your way?!?! AGhhhhhhhhhhh

My history professor pushed off the due date of the next midterm until the 20th, meaning that i can now put all my effort into my scholarship and the GRE :-)

Speaking of which i'm taking the actual GRE tomorrow....yes, tomorrow. 

My scores are all over the place...I could be doing great on the math (like my 650, yesterday), and then shitty on the english (500)...then the next test i take amazing on the english (700) and real shitty on the math (400). jesus christ...i'm just hoping for a 1200 at this point...i know that that seems sad, but i really am bad at taking timed tests...this is why i prefer just writing essays all the freaking time.

"event","<i>1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me.""
2. I will respond by asking you 5 questions.
3. You should then update your LJ with the answers to the questions.
4. You should include this and an offer to interview someone else in the post.
5. When others comment asking to be interviewed you should ask them 5 questions.</i>

Questions asked by THE Sarah Maas. 

<b>1. If you were stuck on a deserted island and could only watch one movie for the rest of your life there, what would it be? (this is, of course, believing that your island has a tv, dvd player, and a power source. :-P)</b>
First off, that's a kick ass island. As long as I can go through some breaks between watching the movie and not watching the movie, i would have to say <i>Gone With The Wind</i>. 

<B>2. Would you rather be blind or deaf?</b>
That's such a difficult question. I think that I would die if I wasn't able to hear music ever again, and I think that it would be very sad if i couldn't see what my own children looked like...if I was born with one or the other disability it wouldn't necessarily matter, because I wouldn't have experienced before what it was like to see or hear. I would probably keep my sight (there are many more accomidations made for deaf people vs blind people), and i could still drive and do many things that people with all their senses do. 

<b>3. Who is the most influential person in your life?</b>
This is also a very hard question, because i didn't have anyone really to idolize growing up. I would have said about 10 years ago my mother, but now that doesn't ring true. Now I find influence through inspirational policy makers (Hillary Clinton, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Barack Obama), people of the past who fought for justice and equality (Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln), amongst many individual people i meet along my life journey. I try to pull the good things from everyone i meet or read about in my attempts to be the best person i can be. There is no one person.  

<b>4. If you could go anywhere in the world right now, where would it be?</b>
I've decided to stop thinking in this context and try to be happy wherever i am. When i was in israel i was wishing i was in california, and when i was in budapest i wished i was in prague, and when i was in california i wished that i was back in israel. I missed a lot of potentially awesome experiences because i was always thinking about where i'd rather be instead of focusing on the experience itself. So to answer your question, being here in california is fine with me. Being in Dc, being in italy, being in france, being anywhere...is just fine :-)

<b>5. If offered immortality (and NO ONE ELSE in the world was), would you take it? (I already asked my friend this, but I think it's an interesting question).</b>
Nope. Why live a life where you have to deal with everyone you've ever known dying? it must be such a lonely existence to be the only one in the entire universe with all these memories in your head and no one alive who even remembers....it's a depressing thought. I would like to live long, but definitely not forever. The people who wish for immortality are those who are afraid of death...and i am definitely not afraid of death."

"event","I've found that i've been doing exceptionally well in my classes--which is surprising, seeing as how I've totally been focused on the GRE and my scholarship stuff. I got a 98% on my Persian test, nothing less than 90% on my homework, and that midterm essay that i was so worried about for my Middle East history class I ended up getting a 94% (47/50). I'm guaranteed an A for my music class, and the grade for my folklore class is dependent on a 10 page essay  and a group assignment, both of which are a cakewalk. 

I unexpectedly spent most of last night a wild protest in West Hollywood. It was crazy because almost 10,000 people showed up...we ended up walking from la vicente to almost hollywood and highland! In the end it came out to almost 10 miles of marching! I felt really good afterwards because I'm standing up for justice and what is right :-)"

A shitty thing is that i woke up this morning with a full-blown cold. I haven't gotten one of those since before i left for Israel! I have mucus in my throat (which is sore) and in my nose, a headache, a fever of 101.1, and I'm super tired...even though i didn't get up until 5pm (i went to bed at 3am!). Though this is absolutely the worst time i could get sick, I don't feel that this cold is that severe..i think it'll go away in a few days. hopefully. 

I did just a tiny bit more studying for the gre, but i just feel blah...i can hardly concentrate. 

The good news is that in the past 3-4 hours or so i got my fever down by one degree (it's now 100.1). I'm just going to go to the store right now and buy some things that will hopefully make me feel better (soup, OJ, water, etc).

It turned out all right..i write my essays a form created that never fails to get less than a B+. I created a sort of outline of sorts and build around it, in so that if i am sort on time i don't have a necessity to write anymore and i can just print it out and be done with it. It's quite clever, if i say so myself, and is perfect for the procrastinator in all of us. I should patent it...10-5 page essays in only a few hours!

So i send one of the people i did an internship with in israel a recommendation form for my scholarship, and he sends me an email back asking me to write a draft of it..he cuts and pastes the questions which are all about how HE thinks i react to unexpected situations, my academics, how long he's known me, etc. He wants me to write my own recommendation. WTF HOW does this work!?

I have this nagging feeling like there's something important i'm supposed to be remembering to do today, but i can't put my finger on it. I don't know. 

I finished all my persian homework up through next week and I don't have much to do outside of studying for the GRE. Today, after my folklore class, i'll just chillax...perhaps go to trader joes, take a nap, and the like."

I don't know. 

I had the most wonderful day on Tuesday. I saw many people i knew from Jerusalem and when they played HaTikvah (the Israeli national anthem) I honestly got teary eyed. The selections were Bernstein, Copland, and some Israeli composer. They also did encores one of which the song was yerushalyim shel zahav (jerusalem of gold). It made me happy. I remember feeling odd because i was so used to being the awkward one trying to adapt into israeli society..and here my friends were the awkward ones trying to fit into my society...It was oddly comforting to see the israelis cutting in line in the coffee area. 

oh I'm improving at my GRE math! who knew i was such a quick learner! I took a practice test and this time i only got 13/16 right rather than like none right. I want to try to get 100%, just so i don't make stupid mistakes on the actual GRE test. 

The past few days i've been working hardcore on my History Essay; I'm writing about how the practices and political/social/etc climate of pre-Islamic 7th century Arabia affected the development of Islam. Essentially i'm just writing a paper about Islam as reflected in the historical context in which it arose. It's a pretty basic and simple essay for a middle eastern studies major, but I'm a lazyass. I wrote a good 2/3 of it on Monday, and today I only worked about an hour on it. I have about another hour left by my estimates but again, i'm a lazyass. 

I fucking locked my bathroom key in the bathroom...i hope i run into someone tomorrow morning so i can take a shower!

I got a GRE math practice book and I was working on that for a little bit...i got through 20 pages and all the math rushed back to me (well the math that i went over, that is). It really relieved a great deal of my stress, and i got all the practice questions in that section correct. I think that if i work hard enough i might be able to get my math score to triumph my english score!

I also wrote half of my essay for my M.E. History class on how Islam reflected the historical context in which it emerged in the early 7th century C.E. in only a half hour...I think that if i work on it for a good few more hours, I can have a very good and well-polished essay on my hands!

He also ate like all of his food which is saying a lot because he got the meat platter (enough for 4 people). He presented me with an early holiday gift: a GPS system. It's pretty kickass...I automatically changed it from an annoying, bitchy woman's voice to a British man's voice. His name according to the GPS is Daniel, but i'm calling him Mr Darcy. I might change it up and put it in Arabic to remind me of my time back in Israel...sigh. 

ANOTHER migraine again tonight...i'm thinking it must have to do with all the stress i'm trying to deal with. It's getting really bad...like...to the point where it hurts so bad i feel like crying...i even threw up...i don't need this now of all times. 

I have a lot to do for the next few weeks...my whole life path rides on a stupid, stupid GRE, of which, none of the questions have to actually do with what i want to do with my life. I cant see how i can improve my score by a few hundred points in just 2 weeks ON TOP of writing 2 essays and finishing up my scholarship application for the summer intensive (which includes 6 essays and getting in tons of transcripts from 4 different schools). 

The only good thing that's happening this week is that i'm going to a concert at my school put on by the Jerusalem Symphony. The tickets were normally $90, but since i'm a student, I only had to pay $15. :-) I'm so excited because i get to see some of the beautiful people i met back in some of the more happier days of my life. 

This one lady i'm especially excited in seeing was an immigrant from Germany who's very involved in community service in israel through music. She often travels to the Palestinian territories and promotes peace through teaching the youth about music, helping out with palestinian youth orchestras, and tutoring kids for free. Her and i became good friends...she bought me coffee all the time and even got my mother and i free tickets to watch the JSO perform. 

I wish this election would end already...i get it..8 more days...but come on. I think that it's completly ridiculous that the whole thing is riding on people who can't make up their minds after almost 2 years of canidate campaigning...a bunch of wishy-washy dumbasses are choosing the direction that our country is going to go the next 4-8 years. ugh."

I'm totally used to going to chabad, most of the stuff being in hebrew, an emphasis on tradition, and also listening to their wonderful chassidic folktales about the baal shem tov or the rebbe. The hillel dinner was spiritually dead, full of annoying persians and jewish sorority girls, and the food was average at best. I enjoyed the political discussion afterward, but the evening itself didn't feel right. I guess I'm more spiritual than i thought...whatever. 

I'm totally enjoying the whole boarding house thing. I just realized when replaying my favorite game/storyline that the main character's adventures started as she was living in a boarding house while she was going to college.I don't know, but this really made me a little revitalized about my situation. I may not have enough to eat, but man, I sure am happy..I'm loving the community atmosphere of a dorm coupled with the maturity of graduate students. 

Today i'm taking the practice GRE with Kaplan...I'll get to see how much i'm going to fail...yay!

On another note, does anyone know how to get burnmarks out of the carpet? or at least make it not look so bad? it's like the sort of carpet that you see in offices (like that generic blue-grey stuff)."

"event","The highlight of the past few days had to be what happened tonight. 

I went to the International Affairs Graduate School fair today and got to talk with representatives from the premiere grad schools that i'm applying to. I talked with reps from GWU, Georgetown, Columbia, and John Hopkin's SAIS. For those of you who don't know, SAIS is the top rated international relations program in the country, and perhaps the world...Georgetown is the top security studies program in the country, GWU the second...and Columbia is...well, Columbia...

Every single one of them thought i was an impressive candidate..and the SAIS guy was super impressed and told me that he thinks that i have a superb chance of getting in! I wasn't even going to apply because I thought that there was no way in hell i could ever get in..he told me that i'm exactly what theyre looking for in candidates...AND all the schools told me that the most important thing is work experience within the field...which i DO have :-)))) and the plus is that it was abroad! Keep in mind that the average age of applicants into their program is 29 years old!

I'm just so jazzed...it took a lot of pressure off of my GRE...i just need a 1250 or a 1300 and i'm set...just...need...to...work...on..my...math. 

Other weird news...i've been getting increasingly hit on by black men...i've never been hit on by a black men, but now it's almost exclusively so...three yesterday and another one today...no idea...i guess my attractiveness to others goes through cultural phases...before it was only latinos and old persian men...lol...

Sleepy time for now...i get my persian quiz score tomorrow ...going to the Presidental shabbat dinner at hillel..and i gotz my Kaplan practice GRE on saturday! :-)

"event","i just realized how much garbage my roommate and i go through--there are three trash cans in our room, and we empty all three of them at least once a week
which is a lot of trash for two people. damn packaging.
and that doesnt even include food waste!
i recycle every weekend! honest!

am feeling very dirty and wasteful.

please recycle"

"event","Existentialism on Prom Night

when the sun came up
we were sleeping in
sunk inside our blankets
sprawled across the bed
and we were dreaming
there are moments when i know it
and the world revolves around us
and we're keeping it
keeping it all going
this delicate balance
vulnerable
all knowing
(sing like you think no one's listening)
you would kill for this
just a little bit
so, sing me something soft
sad and delicate
or loud and out of key
sing me anything
we're glad for what we've got
done with what we've lost
our whole lives laid out right in front of us"

"event","I'm actually going skiing!! Let's see how long this lasts...in terms of ski clothes, (flipflops? what?) I'm borrowing a friend's ski instructor suit that's BRIGHT RED and says ""ski school"" everywhere, in french, of course.
It'll be quite the sight to see a ski instructor falling all over herself...hahaha yeah, that'll be me.

anyone have any tips for a first-timer?"

and my brain too...

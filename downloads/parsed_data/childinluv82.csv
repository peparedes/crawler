Well life still sucks if not more than it did before. yes it does suck more than it did before im ready to fuckin shoot myself. but any ways, yesterday was a good day. I went to ash's house and we hung out there for  a bit then we went and visited jez cuz she was bored and alone. The we were going to go to that fundraiser for micah but instead we went to see Guys & Dolls. Which was kind of boring. Then we went to burger king which was great. Then we hung out upstairs in ashleys room the rest of the night which was very fun. Ashley was making fun of the way i laughed, and she couldnt stop cracking up becuase she kept picturing it in her head then all of a sudden soda poured out of her mouth and onto the floor then it started coming out of my nose it was extremely funny and gross. I jumped off the bad and she got mad at me for not ""comforting"" her , well i didnt want her to spit up on me! and today i went home really early which sucked and i spent the most time online that i ever have before. what a great day today has been huh? not to mention there is nothing at all to eat in my house becuase i am poor and my family sucks ass. Well this is enough for now."

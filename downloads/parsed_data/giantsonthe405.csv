"event","I haven't posted in awhile. I have been more than busy trying to get life back on track. Let's review.

Last Spring was rough for me. I was diagnosed with anxiety. My aunt almost passed. My mom had to have immediate surgery due to cancerous cysts found on her ovaries. I had to quit Best Buy due to my anxiety. I developed a drinking problem. I surrounded myself with low people. I let myself be used by a lower than low disgrace of a person. I pushed the good friends away. I lost track of who I was. I failed the two classes I was taking. I dropped the others because I dropped out of Speed. I figured out my desired career for the past three years really wasn't what I wanted to do and that I was unhappy and very lost. That was a lot to type out. I'm sure you know what I am talking about. You can't deny I acted different, looked different, and was lost. 

HOWEVER

That is all over with now. 

I just finished this semester with STRAIGHT A'S!!!!!!
I date a wonderful guy who is not only my boyfriend, but the greatest best friend I have ever had.
I stopped drinking a long time ago. Nashville/my birthday was the last time. I can't even make myself take a drink. I may consider a beer or a glass of wine, but that's it. No more drunk stupidity because that is all it is.
I found myself again. I found new motivations for life. I decided that I am going to get my PhD and teach as a respectable Professor. My goal is to educate the ignorant.&nbsp; I plan to get a Bachelors in History with a concentration on the Social Sciences, with the Humanities area focused on Philosophy. I want to get my masters in both Philosophy and Sociology (maybe...it might be one or the other). Then, I want my PhD in Sociology. I'm excited. I love school. It's almost like being a professional student.
I finally found a JOB! woot! I work for Red Bull now. Yep, that is right Seth. I am a MET. I get to pass it out for free, wear sweet Red Bull clothing, drink Red Bull, drive the sweet Mini, and get paid for it. I'm so ""stoked"".
My mom is healthy, as well as my aunt. The family part of my life is good.

Plus, I'm super excited for tomorrow. Perfect North Slopes is opening for an early weekend special. Ryan, Martin, and I are going snowboarding. I have always wanted to snowboard. This season I am dedicating myself. I have a sweet Burton board. I am about to order some Ride bindings. I got some awesome brand new Vans snowboard boots off of Ebay for really cheap. And there's a whole lot more. It's a great end to a well accomplished semester.

I'm so happy it's Christmas time. It brings out the best in everyone. Not to mention, I don't work retail. WOOT x 10! lol

Seth, hurry up and come home.
Jodi, we need to hang soon. ASAP.

Much love for everyone &lt;3
I hope you all are doing well too :)"

I love Ryan. &lt;3
I have straight A's in all of my classes as of now.&nbsp; I haven't got anything lower than a 96 on all of my exams.&nbsp; I love history, philosophy, and sociology.
I love Ryan. &lt;3
Louisville is lame.&nbsp; There is never anything to do.&nbsp; I don't want to party.&nbsp; I'm over that phase.&nbsp; I guess you could say I grew up.&nbsp; Ryan and I act like an old couple.&nbsp; All we do is go out to eat, watch movies, and fall asleep together.&nbsp; I love it though. :)
I love Ryan. &lt;3
I'm happy everyone else is happy as well. :)
I love Ryan. &lt;3
What happened to the car scene?&nbsp; I'm ready to sell my car and get either a kouki or a da gsr.
I love Ryan. &lt;3
We're going to see Dracula, and I'm super excited.&nbsp; Plus, we are driving to Brown County Saturday for the day...hopefully.
I love Ryan. &lt;3
I'm trying really hard to let go of my trust issues.&nbsp; Ryan is the best guy that has ever came into my life.&nbsp; However, I still can't accept that he is not going to hurt me...hopefully not.&nbsp; SEE, there I go again!
I love Ryan. &lt;3
And did I mention I am in love with Ryan? He's amazing.
Sigh...I'm so happy it's October! :)"

"event","<font size=""2""><font size=""1"">What makes a friend a friend?&nbsp; I'm not really sure anymore.&nbsp; I once thought a friend was someone you could go to with a problem or ask for a favor.&nbsp; However, that is not the case.&nbsp; Nothing is life is free.&nbsp; Friendship even costs.&nbsp; If you ask something of someone, you are expected to give three fold that in return.&nbsp; Should a relationship based on trust require such an agreement?&nbsp; I feel like I can't even ask anyone for anything any more.&nbsp; Every time I depend on someone, I get screwed over or I'm made into the antagonist that doesn't appreciate anything.&nbsp; The past three months have been hell for me.&nbsp; I've had no job.&nbsp; My car is a constant problem, and I am left with no transportation to school or to a possible job.&nbsp; My mom had to have immediate surgery in March, causing us to get far behind on bills and worries.&nbsp; She is the only family I really have.&nbsp; My father chose drugs over family.&nbsp; My brothers are busy with their adult lives.&nbsp; The rest of my family only cares about themselves.&nbsp; Without her, I would fail.&nbsp; She is the glue that holds my pieces together.&nbsp; I want to help her, but I can't even help myself right now.&nbsp; I am going today to look at an old school Volvo.&nbsp; I am tired of my car breaking down due to the mods and the handling.&nbsp; I am tired of having to ask people for help with my car and there after being told that I am non-appreciative.&nbsp; This is a growing concept with the men in my life.&nbsp; Take for example my best friend Ryan.&nbsp; Ryan and I have been close now for 11 months.&nbsp; Over that time period, we have had many fights, majority of them dealing with him being angry at me for not being appreciative of the things he does for me.&nbsp; What does he mean by appreciative?&nbsp; When a friend gives you a ride, do you have to give them a ride in return or give something else?&nbsp; I thought you could give something else.&nbsp; However, I've come to find people expect the exact same thing in return three fold.&nbsp; Why can't you just give them loyalty?&nbsp; It's not good enough.&nbsp; He claims he loves me, but does he even understand what love is?&nbsp; Love is not something acquired after a few weeks or a few months.&nbsp; Love is obtained after a long period of time.&nbsp; Love requires growth.&nbsp; Love requires knowledge.&nbsp; You can be highly infatuated with someone at first, even right at the start.&nbsp; Infatuation is not a bad thing.&nbsp; People look down upon it.&nbsp; I enjoy it.&nbsp; The early infatuation is exciting.&nbsp; You explore new things and ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't sleep.&nbsp; You can't eat.&nbsp; You're lost in thought.&nbsp; Your creative level is at an all time high.&nbsp; I haven't felt that way in so long.&nbsp; I miss that early excitement.&nbsp; I want to be infatuation with someone and someone infatuated with me.&nbsp; I want someone to love me.&nbsp; I want someone to want me, and I want to want someone.&nbsp; Where is the person that is going to make my knees weak? My life is an abstract mess.&nbsp; Everything from school to my car to my love life is out of wack.&nbsp; I can't even maintain healthy friendships.&nbsp; Am I doomed?&nbsp; Am I a terrible person?&nbsp; Or am I just looking in the wrong places?</font><br /></font>"

"event","Apparently the cure for quitting life is a weekend in Harpers Ferry with 10 other students and one weird history prof. activities include museum hoping, victorian games, taboo, and long walks on the ice. add in lack of sleep, a bit of alcohol, and the beautiful absence of major drama, and you have pretty much the most amazing weekend I've had in a long time. :D"

"event","Wow, it's been awile. In semester 4 of 8 at JMU. The last few months have been interesting.  Living in Converse has been great.  Kellie and I have befriended two girls, Emily and Jenny, who live across the hall. We'll be living all together in a house near campus next year. :) Excited about that. And the other exciting thing is that I'm going to ITALY this summer for 4 weeks!!!!! soo excited about that. I'm going to Bari for field school.  Unfortunatly this means that I'm gonna have work issues cause of timing. I just need to find a job so I have some money. Cause I've heard that helps. Just a rumor though. Sleep time. Maybe I'll start updating this more than a few times a year?"

I'm still recovering from work and being sick. Hope my new check card gets here before I leave. My walet got stolen last week, so I have to get a new one. Fun times huh?

"event","Well, things are beginning to change at a rapid pace.  This is my last week at work, possibly ever at this job.  I had to get reading glasses yesterday. so sexy, am i right? One of my friends goes to boot camp in about a week.  And then in less than 2 weeks, year 2 of the JMU craziness begins!! I'm quite excited about that last one.  I have so much crap to do beforehand though!  Bascially anything i didn't need didn't get unpacked.  so we'll see how that packing thing goes.  At least move in will be easier, since i'm on the 1st floor and Kellie (and half my 100 person dorm) will already be there. So as of August 26 u can visit me in Converse 120.  Just remember, I go to the crazy al-ke-hol, it can't come to me. ;-) oh, and I move in on my 20th. Birthday that is."

Since I was missing my JMU girls so much, I ended up in Stafford to visit Kellie. I'm so glad I randomly went to that picnic last year. Otherwise my life there would be very different. 1/3 of the way done with work. got my first paycheck yesterday, which was very nice. money makes me happy. so does sleep. i miss duck."

Things got a little strained with the girls in Ike at the end, but it worked out alright.  I'm excited cause I'm living with Kellie in the sub-free dorm next year.  First I have to get through the summer though. I'm back at Chinn running after the little ones again.  I'm also taking an art history class at NOVA so I don't get behind.  
It's been weird being back in Woodbridge.  I haven't seen anyone from Gar-Field except for Ashley.  It's amazing the changes that a year can bring, but that's a whole nother thing. So yea."

The girls ony the floor are amazing. They've dealt with my weird mood swings so well. :) This past Saturday some of us went out, and for some reason i got really upset and down. Not a panic attack, more like a depression attack. But they not only tried to comfort me even though they had no idea what was going on, a few of them halted their partying to get me outside and jersey quit for the night to get me home. Signs of true friendship in college. :) one of my suitemates keeps getting sick, so she's been between here and home a lot. She's coming back today thought. happyiness. have audition on wed, and again in a little over a week. these people need to throw me a bone soon, or i gonna get mad! grr. anyways, i gotta go to class now.

That's my soapbox of the day. Off to everyday lifeness. Went on the new student retreat. Very fun. Lots of randomness. Couple of cute guys, which always helps. Got a few funny pictures.

"event","wow, this has got to have been the craziest weekend i've ever experienced. from the begining:
Friday: the sane day of the weekend.  went to school, came home, packed while 1/2 asleep. read the whole way down to VA beach. once we got there saw some people real quick. then we all kinda lost track of each other, so i just stayed up in the room. got bored, called rose as she was coming home from her senior trip. walking around a hotel talking on the phone is very strange. 
Saturday: the crazy day. the morning was pretty inocent. we played pretty well the 1st game. then it started with karen getting kneed in the ribs. she was in serious pain for a long while. our resident nurse-in-training and EMT were worried, so the head people at the tourney called an ambulence just to be sure. the guy didn't know what side the liver is one!  :-P scary. karen pulled through though and played in game two. in which we did crappy. the team was crazy though and desi almost got in a fight again. after the game i got dragged to mass with my parents while most of the rest of them went to the beach. at the beach karen's boyfriend JK, who is katie B skinny, decided to go in the water for a bit too long. when they went back upstairs he was still  shaking. so when i got back my coach was freaking out,  cause JK and Jeff (karen's best friend's mandy's boyfriend) weren't supposed to be there and now JK was sick. so yet another ambulence was called for him. he actually went tko the hospital for like 3 hours til they got him back to normal. while he, mandy, and jeff were at the hospital, the rest of us went to our pre-schedualed team party. that was fun, more subdued crazyiness. i mentioned somthing about fudge, and then like 6 people wanted some, so off we went on a 15 block ADD exodus to get some. stoped in a random arcade on the way, cause that's us. came back, then me and CeCe went walking on the beach cause we had nothing else to do and didn't want to go in our rooms with our parents. as we came back, JK and Mandy beckoned us upstairs from their 4th floor balcony. the four of them plus justine and talon were getting ready to go to a club. wanted to go with them, but the rents said no. went and hung out in a couple of the other girls' room as they called around trying to obtain some beer. then went to bed late.
Sunday: normal in comparison. found out the clubgoers got back at like 3 am, so kinda happy i couldn't go. tripped on the stairs leaving the hotel and fucked up my ankel pretty bad. went to the field for final game against hometown  rival. and i do mean rival. tied 1-1 cause the ref was dumb and called a corner that shoulda been a goal kick. grr. they were pushing like mad! it was great though, cause we pushed right back, just legaly! :) hehe. after that, fun 3 1/2 hour car ride home with nothing to read! went to church. my last sunday night! :( i'm gonna miss those kids! had fun, got scolded for hurting meself again (ankel was wrapped). had fun watching people attempt to hula! 
ok, now that was LONG! gonna go eat yummy fudge and go to sleep now. later!"

"event","I don't know what to do right now. People's lives are falling apart around me, and i want to help so badly. i just don't know how. i just worry i'm gonna make things worse. things are changing in a major way. regular church stuff is almost over. flour babies start next week. friend stuff is all screwy. and with college looming, things are jsut a little hectic. add IB exams and i'm a nut case. :-P but thankfully steel magnolias stuff started this week, so i've been there some. i love the castaways people, i'm gonna miss them so much when i go away next year. :( and then there's a personal issue that i'm not quite sure how to handle. i've been ignoring it for too long though, i gotta face up to it sooner or later. and deal with the consequences. it would help if people would refrain from mentioning it that should not be involved, but u can't ask for miracles. just a shread of sanity to get through the day. later all."

"event","Wohoo, last night was fun! Interestingness all around. I ended up not having a game yesterday, so i was able to just chill at my house til it was time to get a shower. was putting off getting ready, so i didn't start til like 4:45ish. my hair was crazy and not behaving at all, so we ended up just finishing it as tom got to my house. took pictures (my mouth still hurts), and then it was off to good old gettofield to meet evryone else and head out. shaun's mom took get more pictures, and then we were off to dinner- well, kind of. we had issues with where we originally were gonna eat, so we ended up going over to a little Indian place across the street. it was a lot of fun, and the food was suprisingly good. i'm gonna kill ashley monday for a few comments she made about things that are better to be left weel enough alone. but anyways. got up to prom at about 9:45, but didn't actually get in til about 10 due to the like 10 cop cars in front. we got in and found out why- some stupid boy had gotten himself arrested.  it was strange. prom was fun, danced a lot, which i was happy about. didn't have to wrap up anything! :-D happiness. we left a few minutes before the end. the ride home was EXTREMELY interesting, but that's nothing i can go into detail about here. dropped tom off at home, then came home to change. then got to go over to teresa's and spend some quality time with my other favorite people! :) twas very fun. just got home a few minutes ago from her place. very sleepy now, but have lots of work to get done. later kiddos!"

"event","hello crazy people! wow, that was a little crazy for 12:24 am! it's been a interesting couple of days. one thing i forgot to mention about yesterday- the fun andrew scare. when were sitting in the intro thing yesterday, i looked across to the castwalk thingie and i coulda swore i saw andrew, my stalker exboyfriend, walking in with his parents. i freaked. i mean, up close u could tell they didn't look all that much alike, but from 50 feet, this guy was a dead ringer. interesting experience there. umm. today was pretty ok. had soccer game. reston kids are spoiled and dumb. they were just trying to get a couple of our girls to throw punches, calling them white trash and the like. grr, they made me mad! and they were pushing and shoving all over the place. and i noticed they went after all the girls with knee braces. stupid jerks! sorry, done ranting now. also talked to the wonderous caleb (yes, the hot one teresa and janice) a little before and now actually. i love that boy to death. i've known him for five years almost now, and it's amazing how much we've grown up since we met. he's still my therapist though! :) hey, i'm everyone else's, i need one too! it's all cool. he finally has an updated picture of me. i usually am the one taking photos since i hate how i look in em, so my senior ones are the first set i have to send. so now every picture he has of me i now longer am 13 in. this is good, since when i was 13 i was about 10 pounds lighter (actually wish i still was), had long hair that was always up, and was even more tomboyish than i am now. hense why i rendered all the boys speechless the first danceday when brooke and kim paraded me downstairs in a halter top, short shorts, my hair down and curled, and my first crack at real make up, mascara included. good memories. woho. man, those were the days. but now it's high school graduation time, and it couldn't have happended any sooner. people are really starting to piss me off at gar-feild. especailly a certain group, that shall remain nameless, that find it their place to critize others appearance, especailly when they are by no means perfect. grr. thankfully i have good friends who clue me in on these things when they happen. alrighty, very long entry being i just updated yesterday. i'm off to attempt to sleep, later kids!"

"event","IM BACK!!! This weekend, was, well, interesting. warning, this entry might not make complete sense, i got 9 hours of sleep the two nights combined. friday was interesting with the lack of busses til like 8. they got lost and we thought we were gonna have to transport 105 people in an 8 passanger van and a couple of cars! now that woulda been a sight to see. :) friday night was ok. my kids were all very quiet. i always get the shy ones! boo. that night the girls in my cabin wouldn't shut up! we didn't go to sleep until at least after 2, and then were all woken up by em around 7. grrr. saturday was good. they had the talk where i do the personal experience stuff 1st, which was daunting. i burst into tears during it. i'm glad i did it though cause supposedly a lot of other groups said it touched their kids. and little melanie came up and told me so herself. :) so it was all good. my hands are sore from banging the tables. and my leg is sore from where i got beaned my a hershy kiss. i have a bruise now! :( my kids were still really quiet. boo. sat night the girls were again very loud. i got a very touching letter from tom and rose (delivered by the lovely noelle, who also wrote a nice note). finally got to sleep after the iceshower from doom around 1ish. got up at 5:freaking30. i was cranking. i got to have caffine though, which was nice. :) went through the sunday stuff. cleaned, went back to church. saw random basketball people. went to brother's with most of the faciliators. very interesting times. andrew repainting his nails. couple time. and my favorite exchange: Emily: Ronnel, what did you confess? Ronnel: PREMARITAL SEX all of the facils. in brothers: WHAT!!!!! then father planty walked over to ronnel, and did the little girftletter affrirmation thing. it was really funny. or maybe it was just lack of sleep and cleaning products. praying for snow now so i don't have to do my oral tomarrow. off to dreamland to recover now...."

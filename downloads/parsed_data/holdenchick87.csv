well life over all.... currently its up and down, not sure if its good bad... still a little standoff-ish with my parents, but i think things are getting better.....

work.... well i like what i do... but its just too much travel... i don't earn enough to live in Sydney, BUMMER!!! that means 1 hour 30mins travel each way and petrol money.... I've been applying in Wollongong, but nothing yet....

Me..... I'm trying to loose weight... i am going for a walk each evening when i get home from work... and endeavoring to do 2x walks on weekends and/or each day i don't work.... like RDO's and the such... I am making my self loose weight the ""healthy"" way this time no matter how hard i have to PUSH my self.... unlike last time i lost weight where i just stopped eating... i mean i achieved my goal, i lost 20KG's... but now i've put it back on i not happy with that......

Any way..... I'd best be off to bed... staff meeting tomorrow morning, must go bed earlier...

WOW 2 years hey... milestone...

Steve took me to the beach for lunch.
its my favourite date location, our first date was at te beach *and funnily enough steve didn't even know* and for our 1 year i recreated te 1st date...

But this time was a little different... we ate and went for a walk along the beach... and found some rock pools, we went rock pool searching... i found 3 crabs, and an octapus. *we had calamari for lunch... but i didn't tell him that* and lots of sea urchends (or how ever i spell it)it was pretty good afternoon all in all."

Maybe working in sydney i'm not around enough, maybe i work too hard, or is it jelliousy cos my life is on track, my plans are falling into place i have a loving careing boyfriend, oneday to be husband. I have my Dream job... i have my own car, and i'm able to be happy with a minimum trainee wage and seeing my boy minimal hours per week.

I dont get it... i used to know but i just dont anymore... people change... sometimes its for the better, but then there r the ones who change for the worst...

I've tried, i've tried my hardest and i've tried again... everywhere i move, anything i do anything i say seems to be an incriminating move according to some... there is nothin i can do or say to prove my inocence when they have already decided that untrue lies and deceiving hurts and pains are correct.

I guess my only move left to take is to just move away sadly say goodbye to old friends bid them farewell and moveon from this tourcher and pain"

I've learnt forgiveness + repentance. I've learnt to forgive and love my self. (which is something that i struggled with)
 I've learn't to how important it is to walk with God and just how dificult life was when i'd walked away. it was like i was lost in a forest unable to find the HWY i searched and searched in different directions and i just ended up walking in circles. But now i've relyed on God and he's helped me find the HWY again. and i'm travelling along towards healing + moving on. I feel so released. I'm on a spiritual high."

Well Very sad news.... I lost a kitty, PJ (Purry JNR) named after her mummy. Died... 24 FEB 2006 - 30 AUG 2006... so young, I love you and miss You PJ!! *tears*

Work is moving in a positive direction... I'm currently in the hire department and my manager is so impressed with me and my work that he doesnt want me to move onto installs as my trainee schedule says i will... i'm not sure weather to be happy or sad... Work is so BUSY!! *BAH* work funfunfun!?! Jess is Now the prep bitch... :(

Stump is a christian music festival that my work do the sound and lighting for.... BIG job but its loads of fun!

*Random Drinking Fun*
went out with some friends last weekend... a motercycle group rolled into where we were drinking and my friend blaise LOVES Bikes... and was getting chatted up.... they had planned to meet up with us at oxy later on... but us travelling by foot they beat us there n then took off cos they couldnt find us (of course we didn't know at the time so we thought we got stood up) 

We picked up 2 randoms that night.... the first is an assistant director for ATN7 and was heaps happy that i'm also ""in the industry"" he used to be a cartoonist for ren and stimpy... I've got some signed coaster drawings... they r pretty cool... the second found us after oxy closed... on our walk to find somewhere open walking through the mall, me being me... i BURP!!!! random #2 was like wow... and challenged me to a burp comp... but then he chickened out... WHAT IS WITH THAT!!! then he proceeded to hit on me... & kept trying to steal a kiss *GO AWAY STUPID DRUNK RANDOM* according to my friend he was hot... but i dont care... 
at one point i thought i was lucky cos i lost him.... but then he found us again... DAMN IT!!! I was so close to nutting him... *Dont touch my but!*

Any way random #2 kept up his act and i thought i'd never loose him... after EVERYTHING shut it was kebab time... on the way to the shop he was trying to get me to leave my friends and go home with him... *yea right buddy, I'm not that stupid, nor am i that intoxicated* 

:O *tear* i lost one of my earrings.... i liked that pair too... guess its not such a big loss. i only paid a couple of dollars for them."

Ok please excuse my ramblings and the some what essay like opening 

As of late i have discovered a neighbourhood friend to be a 2-faced-backstabbing-so-and-so, and thats putting i lightly (trust me i had nastier things i wanted to say) 
This ""friend"" has abused MY mother on several occassions, now with my working in sydney this has led to me not seeing this, or hearing this, mum not wanting to trouble me, didnt tell me, until i heard it myself one morning that i had to go into work late cos of a VERY late finish (but thats a story for another time)Grrrrr what annoys me the most is this ""friend"" will be a jerk to my mum but a darling to me... 

Steve's back seems to be getting worse, he hurt it at work, and has MANY a day off, he was in a car smash while off too, which just agrivated things... :( and has had several more days off since. I worrie i really do. i mean how will it affect him in the future?? what about interacting with his children... weather they be with me or somebody else!!! can he still play? will it get better? will it go away?
Now the doctors have said he cant drive to work, Hmmmm public transport time... Thats really not good, means he is away longer each day... making a 10 hour day a 12 - 13 hour one.

And the thing I'm most annoyed about.
My present i got for steves 21st... being tix 2 scared weird little guys for THIS saturday. which i'd planned a suprise to go to dinner before hand and then going out after, Has now been screwed over. all due to public transport and working and stuff... he can make it to scardies... Just.... and ONLY JUST!!!!! and if it goes tooo late he'll be tired for work sunday *TEAR* 

I really dislike this!!!! and to top it all off my car has blown up!!!! MOTHER F****R!!!!! 

Any way I better be going... dinner to be had... yuuummmmo...

Uh huh That's right
I took your words And I believed In everything You said to me Yeah huh That's right

If someone said three years from now You'd be long gone I'd stand up and punch them out 'Cause they're all wrong I know better 'Cause you said forever And ever Who knew?

Remember when we were such fools and so convinced and just too cool
Oh no no no
I wish I could touch you again I wish I could still call you friend I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now 'Fore they're long gone I guess I just didn't know how I was all wrong but they knew better Still you said forever And ever....  Who knew?

I'll keep you locked in my head Until we meet again Until we, Until we meet again And I won't forget you my friend What happened?

If someone said three years from now You'd be long gone I'd stand up and punch them out 'Cause they're all wrong and That last kiss I'll cherish Until we meet again And time makes It harder I wish I could remember But I keep Your memory You visit me in my sleep

My darling Who knew? My darling My darling Who knew? My darling I miss you My darling Who knew?"

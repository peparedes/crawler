"event","Keep in mind that this was written by god knows who. But there are fuckheads (like me) that will pull this off...

One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.

Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like
it, I just want you to hold me.""

I said, ""WHAT??!! What was that?!""

So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...

""You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

She responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?""

Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.

The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, ""Lets get a pair for each outfit.""

We went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.

I think I threw her for a loop when I said, ""That's fine, honey."" She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, ""I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.""

I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No honey, I don't feel like it.""

Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""WHAT?""

I then said, ""Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?""

Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either....but at least that bitch knows I'm smarter than her."

Went outside to go smoke, the door was locked. ok, how our door is its kinda hard to lock it all the way, I had to use a little force to unlock it. No biggie tho. Unlock it, go outside and smoke. When I was outside I swear I heard like...dishes being rattled around either inside my place or the neighbors, kinda strange. Walk back inside, watch some of AKIRA, go outside to smoke again. DOOR WAS FUCKING LOCKED, I swear I didn't lock it..really, I am fucking positive i didn;t lock it. And if I did I know I didn't force the lock to lock as hard as it was....FUCKED UP. I swear, I didn't take anything, havent drank for a couple days, and was wide awake when all this was going on.

Anyway, back to AKIRA..hehe...this is the part where Tetsuo steals Kanadas bike and gets into a fight with the rival gang. Well, Tetsuo and his girl get their asses kicked and Kaneda and his boyz save them...I know..DORK..."

"event","Motorcycles won't nag at ya if you forgot to do something.
Motorcycles will never be late.
Motorcycles will not flicker their eyes and start brushing their hair to other motorcycles.
You can ride a motorcycle as hard and as long as you like and your motorcycle will beg for more.
If you don't like the sound your motorcycle makes, you can always change the end can.
If you don't like the way your motorcycle handles, you can always change your motorcycles attitudes.
You never have to guess what mood your motorcycle is in because it is always in a good one. Your motorcycle doesnt change abruptly. 
Your motorcycle wont lock you out of the bathroom.

I remember when sex was safe and bikes were dangerous (you just had to watch out for the father with a shotgun)

Bikes will never ask for a Vuitton, Chanel or a Prada bag. Bikes will never ask for a diamond ring. Bikes will never ask for a date at an expensive restaurant. Bikes only eat up gasoline and will never get fat. Bikes will never ask for monthly groceries. AND men dont have to make up funky, out of this world excuses to his bike whenever he arrives late at 4:00 in the morning.


A big difference I have found between bikes and women is that you don't like your bike to get wet.

But the one thing I have found in common with both is if you dont respect your motorcycle or your girl either will slap you, kick you in the nuts and throw you off.


And just so my go-ganger chicks (I think that is HOT by the way..chicks on crotch rockets, what else could I ask for) wont get bitchy I will post this too

Reasons Why Motorcycles Are Better Than Men:

A motorcycle can go for more than one ride in an hour. 
Motorcycles never develop spare tires. 
Motorcycles last longer. 
Motorcycles don't get you pregnant. 
A motorcycle doesn't care what time of month it is. 
Motorcycles don't have parents. 
Your motorcycle will let you know if something is wrong. 
You don't have to kick your motorcycle to get it going. 
Your motorcycle won't judge your friends. 
If your motorcycle smokes you can do something about it. 
Motorcycles don't care about how many other motorcycles you have ridden. 
When riding, you and your motorcycle both arrive at the same time. 
One motorcycle will satisfy you every time. 
Your motorcycle won't ogle other motorcycles. 
Your motorcycle won't care if you have a poster of your fantasy motorcycle. 
If your motorcycle has high mileage, you can just get a new one. 
Motorcycles don't care about breast size. 
If your motorcycle is misaligned, you don't have to discuss politics to correct it. 
You don't have to drink beer before your motorcycle looks appealing. 
You can be proud of your motorcycle regardless of the model. 
Your motorcycle won't beat you or try to make you feel inferior. 
You can ride a motorcycle as long as you want and it won't get limp. 
Your parents won't keep in touch with your old motorcycle after you dump it. 
Motorcycles always feel like going for a ride when you do. 
Motorcycles don't insult you if you are a novice. 
Your motorcycle never wants a night out alone with the other motorcycles. 
Motorcycles don't make you late. 
Your motorcycle won't complain when you use protection. 
If your motorcycle doesn't look good, you can paint it or get better parts. 
You can't get a disease from a motorcycle. 
Your motorcycle won't care if you fake it. 
Motorcycles are always ready to stop when you are. 
Your motorcycle has a built in vibrator. 
Your motorcycle doesn't have to show off in front of other motorcycles. 
Your motorcycle won't lie to you. 
Your motorcycle doesn't care how heavy you are. 
In the morning, your motorcycle won't poke you in the back when it wants to go for a ride. 
Your motorcycle won't shrink when it's cold. 
You don't have to cook for your motorcycle. 
Your motorcycle can't ride around behind your back. 
If your motorcycle is cold you can choke it. 
Your motorcycle is always the right size because if it seems too small you can just get a new one. 
You can keep photos of your old motorcycles. 
Your motorcycle can go for multiple rides. 
Motorcycles don't need pick-up lines. 
You only have to ride your motorcycle when you want to. 
Motorcycles don't snore.
A motorcycle won't get back at you if you dump it
If a woman has the right bike/man, 

BOTH can:

...be ridden
...satisfy
...please
...feel good
...make you feel damn sexy
...make noise if handled in certain way
...give you multiple rides
...hurt you at times
...dump you
...burn you
...cost money
...require attention
...be sat on"

"event","1. Only drunk dial when you are DRUNK...... Everything else is false advertisement...And no excuse.

2. It is okay to call someone 37 times in one night..... If you don't remember it....... it didn't happen!!!.

3. If you are going to drunk dial a family member..... say something nice...... IE: ""Mom I'm at McDonald's and they're playing our song..... I FUCKIN love you MAN""

4. Dirty talk while drunk dialing is always preferred..... Who doesn't want to hear your best slurring slobering phone sex voice at 3 A.M. asking to bend them over something......

5. Voicemails are always better..... This way your friend can let their friends talk shit at your expense for days, even weeks to come.

6. Drunk texting is also acceptable, and easier to say that it really wasn't you it was your mean friend..... only If you are prepared to read what you wrote the next day when you are sober.

7. It is definitely a GOOD idea to call all of your ex's and remind them that you were the best lover they've ever had ...and your pussy is the best one they will eva eva eva eva....eva have! And they will regret it every day of their life...because everything they know, they learned from you..... and the only face they will see is yours......This way you can finally pass out with a smile!

8. You can also call this same ex and let him/her know, that you KNOW that THEY still love you....... Then explain to them that I would still love me too!

9. If you are a frequent dialer, never get mad if someone drunk dials you..... Be happy they thought of you in this special time of reflection!

10. It is ALWAYS a good idea to sing on someone's answering machine or voicemail. Especially an old love song you two used to listen too.....you almost sound just like the artist!!

11. Drunk dialing should be fun and light hearted or dirty and sex crazed... Never angry. It is a time of reflection.

12. Most likely you will never drunk dial your best friends. They are usually the ones taking your phone away and reminding you that ""you have a problem"".... OR.....they are also drunk dialing along with you to their significant ex-others....

13. If you deleted a number sober, it was probably for a good reason. Do not try to retrieve this number. Nothing good can come from it. (LMAO so true)!!!!!

14. Always call someone you know. Finding random numbers in phone books is bad and usually leads to angry dialing....and some stalking.....if ur voice is extra sexxxy!

15. If your cell phone dies, remember everything happens for a reason. Never borrow a friend's phone to continue to do your drunk dialing.

16. Drunk dialing to foreign country is usually too costly to be a good idea...and usually you dont know the language as good as you thought while your drunk......BUT..... if you feel like if you don't call this person you'll just die, brake rule 15 and use a friend's phone.

17. Drunk dialing may lead to drunk muffin stuffing....or drunk object lovin....... Be prepared...and watch for camaras.

18. When dialing remember that ""hanging out"" at 3A.M. usually doesn't involve cards or a movie...... it's probably going to be more like cheap lube and handcuffs...... So be prepared when you really do want to play X-box when you're drunk..... ""you want me to do what with your box? Play with it?""

19. Don't drunk dial in the pool, tub, or rainstorm. It only ends up with you blow drying your phone when your far to drunk to be using electronics and you wont be able to drunk dial anymore that night....yo shit is broke.....hope u got phone insurance.

20. Never, I repeat, NEVER drunk dial your boss, preacher-grandparents , or friend's parents..... If you are that hard up to call someone, there is an 800 number on Coors Light boxes. The person on the other line always sounds cute, plus I think they are ex- drunk dialers!!"

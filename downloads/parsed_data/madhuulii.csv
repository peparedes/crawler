<lj-cut text=""Claude""><img src=""http://www.users.on.net/~slaine/hosted/soph/claude_patio_small.jpg""></lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Gabby""><img src=""http://www.users.on.net/~slaine/hosted/soph/gaby_grass_09_small.jpg""></lj-cut>

Aren't they cute?? :-)

Max is my older cat.  He lived with my ex for a while, but came back to live with me about 4 years ago.  Max is somewhat neurotic - wants to be loved but is generally too scared to let you love him.  He's getting better all the time though.  A cuddle from Max is special.  He is black, like Claude, but smaller and with shorter hair.

Claude is my little black angel.  He found me and adopted me, and is just the most loving and loyal cat imaginable.  Well actually, to clarify, he is loving towards me - he terrorises Max, which is really not nice.  After a few months of being scared of Gabby, Claude has now taken over the position of boss there too.  Very funny to watch, given that he is a quarter of her size.

Gabby is the latest addition to the family. She is about 7 months old, and is very hyperactive and excitable.  I currently have a hole in my back yard the size of a grave - Thanks Gab!  We just started dog training on Saturday  - was fun, she is a quick learner.

Anyway, enough bragging about the animals...."

"event","Got home to a bright and cheery message on my answering machine.....from John Howard. Wonder if he really thinks leaving a recorded message on my machine is going to make me forget all the crap and vote for him?

Had a job interview on Tuesday. I think they want someone with business as well as research experience - and I don't have that - but it was a good experience and has got me into the right mindset.   I've been really unhappy at work, and its time to do something about it.

Really struggling at the moment with feeling really crap about myself.  I know its really dangerous to see yourself through other peoples eyes, and I hate that i do it. Especially when the negatives are what have the greatest impact. Just wish I had the confidence in myself to know when I am being treated badly, and act accordingly. Instead of tormenting myself with feelings of inadequacy.  Or maybe I just need to accept that some situations are bad, and no-one is to blame. I really don't know."

"event","I'm a people person. My friends are the most important thing in the world to me (along with my son, of course!).  I am really blessed to have a group of loyal, genuine supportive friends - people who love me even when I stuff up.  Which I do, again and again.  I would never want to do anything to hurt any of these people.  And so, when situations arise where hurt seems inevitable, I feel so totally powerless.   I have to be honest and true, or else I'm not being the kind of friend I want to be -and yet the honesty and truth has the potential to hurt so deeply.  I hate that."

<lj-cut text=""going under"">
Now I will tell you what I've done for you
50 thousand tears I've cried
Screaming Deceiving and Bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me
(I'm going under)
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
I'm dying again

I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through
I'm going under

Blurring and Stirring the truth and the lies
So I don't know what's real and what's not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again

I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through

So go on and scream 
Scream at me I'm so far away
I won't be broken again
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under

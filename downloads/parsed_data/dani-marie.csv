I miss you, miss you so bad
I don't forget you, oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same 

I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't

I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same

I had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
And I can't take it
It wasn't fake
It happened, you passed by

Now your gone, now your gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now your gone, now your gone
There you go, there you go,
Somewhere your not coming back

The day you slipped away
Was the day i found it won't be the same 
The day you slipped away
Was the day that i found it won't be the same 

I miss you"

"event","wow....i havent updated this in like a year!!! kik kik :} but anyways ive been having the worst like month ever. just some things are not going good at all and i dont know what to do. first of all i might be getting in major trouble at work for somethign i didnt even start. i just wanna say sorry to the person who knows who they are, im a horrible person and i wish i could wake up and it be 6 months ago so i could fix things. im done with gossip unless its about me cuz its dumb to talk about people, specially if i dont know everything to begin with. its no ones business... but i cant help it, everyone does it. its a never ending cycle but thats my goal..im done!! i just hope the person can forgive me and yeah im not saying right away but eventually. 
next thing thats really stressing me out is school. for those of you who dont know, im on freaking academic probation from last semester. i got a D in music and it brought my GPA down but it really pisses me off cuz its not like i failed the class, or even need it for that matter. so now if i do bad again this semester ill get suspended for a year from parkside. and would ya look at that, im probally failing economics and politics. what the hell am i gonna do?! who the hell gets susspended from parkside?? you could get in that school if u had a 11 on ur ACT....no thats not what i got but i did pretty bad, like average but still. i cant take it, im going crazy. 
im sorry if u dont wanna read this, its kinda long but come on i never write in here. i miss my brother sooooo much!!! i talk to him all the time online but i think that might make it worse. and he has to go to afganstan next year and i dont know if i can take that. he gets to come home like june 22, just missing my birthday. i love him sooo much and i dont want nehting to happen to him. and hes got a gf that he said when he comes back in 2007 theyre gonna get married. im sooo happy for him. i just wish he was here. 
  i miss my sister and mom too. my sister is my bestfriend and i miss just calling her and saying hey lets go to a movie, i cant do it and i miss her to death and i dont even think she knows how much i look up to her. really, she messed up but shes got her life together and i love her for it. and the baby, i only see him like once a month and thats not enough, i wanna see him grow up. hes got a tooth, how cute!!! im thinking of moving up there maybe, u know if i cvant go to school next year. maybe its for the better cuz i think i need to get away for a little while. 
damn thgis is the longest ive ever written but ive been holding it all in and thats not good. i miss my grandma too. last week was my gpas bday and i felt so bad for him. their anniversary is this month too and thats gonna crush him. and mothers day is in may and i dont know what my dads gonna do. and then her bday is in july, i just cant deal with all this, im not strong enough. i thought i was but i guess im not. for school we have to do a speech about a person and i was thinking my gma but thats gonna be the hardest thing i do. but i wanna cuz i know she will be watching me and i wanna make her proud. 
ok im done now cuz i have to go to work soon and im dreading it. and i just wanna let u know this isnt a feel sorry for me entree and im not looking for any comments but i just broke down thismorning cuz of all this and i needed to get it all out. so i hope everyone has a nice day and hopefully i will see you all later. i love you all and i hope you kow that. danielle"

ive made new friends 
and the bonds will never be broken.
but i still wonder, besides my family, 
is there anyone who truley does love me.
i now have friends closer than ever, 
but the one thing that i strive for 
is someone to spend the rest of my life with.
its been so long since ive felt love for another, 
is my heart growing cold, 
will i ever find that intensity again.
i do miss the ones before, as a matter of fact 
i love them more and more.
but to feel that feeling again, 
i would give anything for the experience.
i pray that someday ill find another.
maybe this one will be trusted 
and i wont have to worry and wonder.
my heart is empty now 
and i need someone to fill it.
but i wonder if maybe im not ment 
to be happy or even have the company.
even in a crowd with all of my friends, 
i still feel alone and empty inside.
someday i may be loved."

Life isn't just full of happiness,
It's sunsets, it's love, it's tears.
It's the thoughts of yesterdays memories,
That can wash away all out fears.

It's that very painful experience,
That each one of us has had.
It's the laughter that fills the air,
It's the tears when you are sad.

It's loving that someone special,
That at one time made you smile.
It's the pain of losing that person,
But the memories that make it worthwhile.

It's that child in every one of us,
Although in time we'll all be old.
It's the good times we'll never forget,
It's the memories we'll always hold.

It's the hug that we all need,
When we'd rather drown in our sorrow.
It's the hope in every one of us,
That makes us hold on for tomorrow."

What is a Grandmother 
A grandmother is a remarkable woman. 
She's a wonderful combination of 
warmth and kindness, laughter and love. 
She overlooks our faults, 
Encourages our dreams, 
and praises our every success. 
A grandmother has the wisdom of a teacher, 
The sincerity of a true friend, 
And the tenderness of a mother. 
She's someone we admire, 
respect and love very much. 
A grandmother will always have a cherished place 
in our memories and in ours hearts. 
She's someone for whom we want every happiness 
In return for the joy she always brings. 
A grandmother is all the dear and precious things in life 
When she's a grandmother like you."

"event","There are these three guys in a desert dying of dehydration. Off in the horizon they see a house and finally manage to struggle to it. The first guy goes up to the door to ask for water. The door is opened by this really old, wart-covered, puss covered, scaly, toothless old woman. 

""C-c-c-can I h-h-h-have some w-w-w-water for me and m-my friends?"" he asks.

She replied, ""I will... if you have sex with me."" 

The guy pukes all over the woman and runs back to his friends. 

""You guys would not believe who answered the door. Some really gross old lady!"" he tells them. ""She said we could have water if I had sex with her."" 

""Why didn't you then?"" asks he second guy.

""Because she was so ugly, I was sick and couldn't do it!""

""Oh, you are such a wuss. I'll go up to the door,"" the second guy says.

He goes up to the door and rings the bell. The old hag answers.

""W-w-w-w-w-w-waaaaaa......"" He uses all of his will power to not hurl.

""Water? Yes, I have water,"" she says knowingly. ""But you have to have sex with me."" 

""AAAAAUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!"" 

He runs back to his friends and before he could say a word, the third guy goes to the door and rings the bell. 

""What do you want for some water?""

""You have to have sex with me."" 

Knowing that if he doesn't do something, he and his friends will all die. So he follows the lady into her kitchen.

""Do me here,"" she told him. 

He sees 3 ears of corn on the counter and gets an idea. 

""Lay back and close your eyes. And keep them closed!"" 

The witch lays back and spreads her legs. The guy nearly pukes after seeing this. He picks up an ear of corn and screws her with it. Finally she is finished. He throws the corn out the window. 

""Oh, God. That was the best orgasm of my life. If you do that again I will give you a million dollars."" 

""Then lay back and close your eyes again."" 

This she does and he does her with the second ear of corn until she is satisfied. Then he throws it out the window. This time she doesn't even open her eyes. 

""If you do that again, I will give you a Jeep so you can get out of the desert."" 

""Eyes closed,"" he says.

Then he does her with the last piece of corn. He brings her to multiple orgasms. 

""Ohhhhhhhhh........ The water, money and Jeep are outside,"" she says as she squirms in ecstasy. 

So he runs like hell outside and grabs the water and money and jumps into the Jeep. He wonders where his friends are and drives around to find them. He finds them by the window. 

One of the guys says to him, ""Hey, man. I hope you had fun. We just ate the three best pieces of buttered corn you could have imagined!""

ewwwwy"

"event","Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road. 
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to do. 
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why. 
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time. 

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. 
I hope you had the time of your life. 

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind. 
Hang it on a shelf of good health and good time. 
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial. 
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while. 
I hope you had the time of your life.

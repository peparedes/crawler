Tears stream down your face
Don't worry, no one is here now
Nobody is listening 
No one cares
Maybe you shouldn't have been born
Even your mom says you shouldn't have

Tears fall 
You can't stop them
Feelings blast uncontrollably 
Everything seems out of your control
Yet you're too scared to do anything to yourself 

Scream
Cry
No one cares 

Don't ask. Bad day."

Mwuah, not many people have been updating their LJs. And I'm being bored out of my mind. So I must do homework and draw. So yay. =3 

{~}<b>Last Night</b>{~}

Oi, last night it raiined. And rained. And rained. And rained. But today it's like sunny and nice. So eh. I liked yesterday better. =P I ran and danced in the rain with an unbrella. Yeah, I know I'm a crazed lunatic. 

Me and my family went to eat, then we came home, I drew for a bit, and watched Survivor. I can't believe Steph almost got voted off! I <3 Steph! She kicks ass! xD 

{~}<b>Random News</b>{~}

Lemme see. 
1. I hafta finish my censorship outline. =P Did you know that Sesame Street is making Cookie Monster go on a diet?! AND EVIL OWL IS STEALING COOKIE MONSTERS COOKIES! And now, he's singing, ""A cookie is a sometimes food,"" instead of, ""C is for cookie, that's good enough for me."" All because of obsese children who are like that because they play video games, and at school they aren't allowed recess. 
2. I must do the stupid science project. >__<
3. Must study for Math Test. 
4. Must study for S.S. quiz. 
5. Must go outside. =3 And hope it's warm. 
6. Oh yeah, and I'm using a new sketchbook, it's bigger, but only has 24 sheets. So it won't last long. But, I need to buy another one. 

{~}<b>Not Much Left Ta Say</b>{~}

I just, you people need to update more! SO YOU CAN GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO! xP Cause I'm such a loser. 

Oh, and I also came up with two new characters. Perhaps I'll use them, perhaps not. But one's a guy with fox ears named Puddle, who is very sexy. XDDDDDDD I colored with craypas, and the color looks good. I'm quite happy with it. And perhaps you could see it if my stupid scanner decided to WORK DAMNIT! -kicks it- And my other new character, not sure if I'll use him, is this half coyote, half dog guy. He's got them cute little ears that go up and flop over. And he's got gauze wrapped all around his ankles and tail. Cause he loves the gauze bandaging. =3 

{~}<b>Eat Me Pwease</b>{~}

Hi kids. How are you? I'm okayish. Sorry, I haven't updated reasontly, just haven't had the time. I probably shouldn't be updating now, but I need to. =3

{~}<b>De Past Couple 'O Days</b>{~}

Lemme see.. erm..Monday was just plain AWFULL. Twas very sucky, I hated Gym. We were playing baseball, (which no one informed me,) and I didn't know you had to run every stinking time if you were on a base. So this girl hit a ball, I was on a base. I stood there. Everyone screamed at me. Then we got two outs and got changed. Supposedly I was confused with mattbal. Screw me. So this one biotch Sydney, goes to her bff Susan and is all like, ""Susan, what game were we playing again?"" And Susan goes, ""I dunno, maybe kickball?"" JERKWADS! Then the rest was just yucky. Other than that, didn't really do much, but atleast I got to go shopping after school. =3 I got a cool pair of HOT PINK BRIGHT capris, khaki capris for school, jean shorts, an elmo t-shirt, and a pink cowgirl hat. Yeee Haa. XDD

That night sucked though, cause I was worried by pal Sam was mad at me. So I IMed her and asked if she was, and she's all like no. Eventually it got to the point where something was buggin her but she wouldn't tell me. I said okay and I'll be supportive even though I don't know. Then she said she told me before but I wasn't supportive. So I called myself an ass. And I signed off and cried myself to sleep, worried she didn't wanna be friends. 

Tuesday, Sam was sick, so I was a bit relieved. Riss was there, so I hung with her and we avoided the Hippo. XDDD It was also the Battle of the Books winners Ice Cream Party H Period, so I got to do that. I ate waaay too much sugar. 

After school, I went to karate. Did homework during the first class, ate pizza during my sisters, then helped out with the third class. A bunch of people got their next belts, so I gave them handshakes and hugs. This one cute guy named Alex, (not Hampel) was all like after I shook his hand, ""You're not gonna hug me are you?"" And I did anyway. ^___^ He kinda cringed and afterwards he was all like, ""You gots COOOTIES!"" It was funny. X3 

Today was just eh. Sam was back, but the night before she told me it was a misunderstanding. So I felt better. I talked to her a bit, but stupid Alaina kept getting in the way. So I hung with Riss mostly. Weird thing was during Gym, the boys weren't allowed in their lockerroom cause a police officer and an administrator was in there. WEIRD. O__O Turned out either some guy laptop was stolen during Gym, or some guy had drugs in his locker. I dunno. H Period was Art Club, and guess what? MR. HALPRIN BROUGHT IN THE HOLY PRISMA MARKERS! =D YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! Nobody else really understood their greatness and shaded with them, but boy did I <3 it! Everyone else treated them like normal markers, but I treated them like gold. =3 Alaina clung to poor Sam like glue during Art Club, so I didn't talk much. She was copying Sam's art and everyone. Biotch. 

After school I went to the Gym, trained Ryan, then went to karate. Helped out with the little kids class. Then in adult class, we went over all the blue techniques, and I forgot nearly EVERYONE till Ms. Tena showed me. She was so frustrated with me. I nearly started to cry one from how bad I was doing, but I stopped myself. Barely.

"event","Hiya people! Dang, I am sooooooooooooooo frickin relieved! Last night was GREAT! The banquet was fun but kinda disappointed. The demo team was the ONLY enertainment, so we didn't get any enertainment! xP Oh well. We ROCKED AND ROLLED BABY! Seriously, like everyone was SOOO INCREDIBLY SICK. Like always. xD Even if I did mess up a little in my staff routine, I was still proud of myself too. ^____^ And then afterwards we got TONS of compliments, even from THE MAN, MR. MILLS!!!!! OMFG! My mom said that he LOVED the routine me, Sara, and Katie did! I felt sooooooooo special. =D 

The other good thing about last night is that I got and gave SOOOO MANY HUGS! Seriously, I probably gave and got back over 100 hugs! HAH! TAKE THAT YOU FREAKIN ANTI-HUGGERS AT MY SCHOOL! And yes, there were GUYS who DID hug me back! CAUSE THEY'RE NOT FRICKIN JERKWADS LIKE SOME OF YOU!!!!! (Although the people I'm talking about can't read this..) Still! Even people like Spanky who HATE hugs hugged me back! HAH! EAT THAT EVIL BOYS! xDDDDD And then everyone was so happy and relieved and great. 

Then after the banquet the lot of kids went bowling downstairs at the hotel! We bowled from 11:00 PM to 1:30 AM! xDDD And I didn't get to bed till 2:00! It was SOOO fun bowling! I bowled with Elf, Marcus, Cody, Katie, Mr. Fuller, Mr. Marcus, and Marcus's uncle! It was SOOO FUN! Then I visited with other demo team people who were bowling too! I <3ed it! 

So today I'm going to da strip and to the STATUSPHERE!!! YAAAAAAY! FUN FUN FUN!"

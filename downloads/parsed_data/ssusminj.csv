"event","Wednesday is bin day and my two neighbours and I keep our wheelie bins around the back of our houses off the road where we park our cars.

Every Tuesday night the bins have to be dragged to the end of the drive so they can be emptied around 7.30am Wednesday morning.

Up until very recently all three bins were always in place at the end of the drive well before I got home from work - I don't know which neighbour had been doing it but needless to say I was always grateful. You see because there are three bins it takes two trips up and down the driveway to get all three down. It wouldn't be any hassle at all if there were just two as you simply park your car round the back at the end of the day and as you walk down the drive you drag the two bins with you.

But a third bin means having to walk back up the drive to get it and drag it down. Hassle you see.

And then on Wednesday post collection the situation is reversed - I normally leave the house at around 8.30am so as I walk up the drive I normally drag two bins with me and put them back in their normal storage place. If I am feeling generous I will walk back down the drive to collect the third one but more often than not I will leave it. 

On some occasions (like if I am running late) I will think 'fuck it' and leave all three at the bottom of the drive vowing to do it when I get home. That said they are inevitably moved by the time I get back.

Anyway what has happened now, after all three bins being taken down by one neighbour, my bin is consistently left at the bottom of the drive - even though every other week or so I do take all three up myself. And occasionally my bin isn't even taken down at all.

So psychological warfare is under way. I think I know which neighbour (neighbour 1) is leaving my bin at the bottom and taking the other two up. So this morning I took his bin up and left the other two alone. Clever eh? Now neighbour 2 will think neighbour 1 is a total wheelie bin wanker as well. 

The object of the game of course is to mess with one neighbours mind so badly that he moves out or comits suicude so there are only two bins to worry about.

I will keep you all posted........"

I also said that if I manually configure the router it all works.

The response I got was:

Dear Customer, 

We assign IP addresses via PPP/ICIP. The recommended way to have a router assigned an IP is to have the settings automaticallly. 

Assigning them is only necessary with multiple IP netblocks and their relavent subnet masks.

"event","It's been an interesting weekend really. I picked Mariana up from Cheltenham on Friday to bring her back to Winchcombe as we generally spend weekends together.

We went down the pub and had a few drinks - she seemed a little distracted but not overly so. Then at the end of the night she announced to me that she was pregnant.

This in itself is quite amazing. When she was younger he had a serious kidney problem. As my knowledge of Swedish medical terms is about as good as her knowledge of English ones I don't know much detail. Suffice to say that her body is running on about half a kidney and I guess the illness caused some severe blood poisoning. The doctors said to her that the chances of her ever becoming pregnant were nil. So she got over it - accepted that she would never be a mum and moved on. And of course knowing this after a short while in our relationship we never really bothered taking precautions.

Then over the last couple of weeks she mentioned to me that she was putting on weight - none of her trousers fitted her any more. Naturally as a bloke I dismissed this as another 'I'm too fat I need to go on a diet' woman thing. 
Aparently since Wednesday last week she has done three home pregnancy tests and they are all positive.

So we have kind of skirted round the issue this weekend. Her feeling is that she isn't ready to be a mum and that abortion is the way forward. Needless to say the timing isn't great for me either - might tell that story in another post - but I am ready to be a dad. Mariana is 21 and not ready to settle down. Is this her only chance of having a baby? What are the medical implications of having an abortion bearing in mind her history?

I am totally aware that my part of the decision is fairly small - it's her body and her life but needless to say I find myself somewhat distracted. I don't know what to do - her being Swedish means it's not as simple as making an appointment at the local doctors surgery to discuss things - they obviously have no idea of her medical history and she is not their patient.

Over to you."

The weekend is about the only time I get to spend with Mariana - I felt so shit yesterday I didn't go to Cheltenham to see her. She is working today too and wild horses won't stop me going over to see her tonight.

"event","First off, Snow is great isn't it! Makes everything look nice. Oh yeah and you can throw it at people.

2 inches in 15 minutes. With thunder an lightning too - never seen that before!

Caused absolute chaos round here! Cleeve hill was a car grave yard by 6pm. People just abandoned them and walked home. 

The M5 was shut at 2pm due to an explosion at a battery factory in Tewkesbury. Big chemical cloud which presumably was brought down by the snow. Hmmm - battery acid snow - could be fun......

Now my car is basically driven by a computer. It has the whole ABS and Traction Control thing along with something called Electronic Stability Programme which compensates for you when you drive like a twat.

Fucking useless in the snow mind. I turned in to North street on sheet ice - the traction control kicks in by reducing power to the wheels and gently applying the brakes. Wheels lock and the ABS kicks in - now skidding sideways in slow motion. ESP kicks in an does fuck all. Bang into kerb on opposite side of the road. 

Least I didn't hit another car but I did look like a twat. And I got a bollocking from a car coming the other way - ""Fucking Slow Down"". Thing is I was going very slowly. Not much more than walking pace. So I shouted back ""Turn your fucking lights on"" - driving around in the dark and snow with no lights on. Now who looks like a twat!"

"event","So there I was with the Mrs watching BBC2 at around 9pm last night. I'd just cooked a Curry and we were halfway through a nice bottle of wine.

Then BBC2 put a documentary on about the ""Silver Ring Thing"". If you didn't see it it was all about American kids pledging not to have sex before they were married.
They get to wear a Silver ring on their wedding ring finger which on their wedding night they take off and give to their husband / wife and say something like ""I have saved myself for you"".

Utter bollocks. Not only were they brainwashing 7-11 year olds with this crap but it was another demonstration of a scary religous cult. They were seen raising money for their 'efforts' whilst at the same time quite happy to spend it on a private jet to get one of their nutty members to a debate.

This was just one of the many hypocracies in the documentary.

Yes there is a serious rise in STD's and all that in America but you are not going to stop teenagers having sex. At the end of the day its instinct.

Education about condoms etc. is far more valuable but according to this program a lot of schools in America don't deem it appropriate till kids are at the age of 15 or more. They think the parents would be offended.

Feeling pretty shit today - some form of virus type thing. Feel totally exhausted and have absolutely no motivation. 

Went to the doctors yesterday for the first time in 5 years or so. I twisted my ankle at the start of December and it still hurts. Fell off the stairs at the Mrs house in Cheltenham - and no I wasn't drunk. Anyway the quack said that there was nothing broken but also nothing he could do. A support bandage wouldn't help as the swelling has gone so it's just one of those things that will take a few months to heal. Bugger.

Thanks to Martin for the Penguin clubbing game. I and all my staff have done no work for an entire day now. I understand it has spread to other companies in Winchcombe who are equally distracted.

Anyway really must try and do some proper work.

Weekend was good - cooked Roast Pork for 4. Went out in town on Friday to the Two Pigs and then on Saturday to an uterly shit nightclub that keeps letting people in until they start popping out of the windows. No room in the cloakroom and no bar staff. So I stood there for an hour holding my coat with half a beer wishing I could go home. 

Went to a friends house prior to the nightclub for a Karaoke party on the occasion of his birthday. A bit weird - parents were there and everything. I managed not to sing. Result.

Good luck with the job bits and pieces Clint.

"event","After some persuasion I get Mariana to pack her things up so we can go home. She had decided she was going to stay in Sweden and not go back to England. She was quite serious about it to. I guess feeling like shite didn't help.

We go over to her Dads place (driven by Beeros) to say goodbye. Her dad is really ill with the cold as is Martina. Both have a bad fever and her dad could barely walk.

We leave for the train station and jump on the first train to Copenhagen airport. 
Two and a half hours later we arrive. Our flight is slightly delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft. When we finally get on the plane it has to go through de-icing which I have never experienced before. Basically the plane taxis into a holding area and is then washed down with a couple of pressure washers on lorries. 
This process takes about 15 minutes or so. 

We finally get airbourne and land in Heathrow about an hour later than expected. We are delayed getting to our gate because someone has parked a couple of lorries in the way so there is another 15 minute wait in another holding area.

Off the plane, through immigration to baggage claim where there is yet another delay as the baggage machine has got jammed. We get our bags back and it looks as though my suitcase got dropped in a massive puddle of water. Thanks Heathrow baggage handlers!

Finally on to the mini bus to take us back to the car park. Now I am not a racist man and I appologise if the following comment comes across that way. On the mini bus is myself and Mariana along with 4 other separate couples and one group of 4. We are the only white couple, the only couple that can speak english and the only couple who haven't lost the ticket which proves our car is parked with this company and we have paid. Chaos. 

Half an hour later we are on our way to the car park.

The drive home was uneventful - in fact it went very quickly. I was very glad to get home and into my own bed.

There ends the Christmas trip to Sweden."

Both Mariana and I wake up with a bad cold. I've got aches and pains all over and Mariana is shivering away with quite a fever. We decide to chill out and spend the day inside with coffee and Nurofen. It was supposed to be a day of shopping but that got cancelled.

Later that evening Mariana feels well enough to cycle over to see a friend. When she comes back we order take away Pizza from one of the miriad of Pizza places in Halmstad and go to bed."

Another late start. Wandered into town again to meet with Johan - Marianas gay friend. Nice bloke bought us a drink and we chatted for an hour or so in the pub.

Went over to Johakim and Lindas place for dinner number 1. Ate quiche and drank baileys. Played with baby Leo for a while.

Then on to Susans - oldest sister - with Marie and her boyfriend Beeros. Susan is maried for a second time with lots of kids. Only one at home however - the yougest one called Stina. 

We have dinner number 2 (Baked Salmon and Potatoe) with enough wine to float a small battleship. 

Then into town with Marie and Beeros. First to Beeros flat for some whisky and lager then into town for a few more lagers. I discover that Marie isn't actually officially seeing Beeros - they only have sex occasionally. The reason she won't go out with him full time is apparently because he has a very small penis. No seriously. 

Beeros is very insecure about this and insists on telling me about it. ""It's not how big it is, it's what you do with it!"". All very true - but it does help to have more than 4 inches. Anyway........ Beeros tries to persuade me to ditch my now very pissed other half and go on the pull with him. Tempting as it was I love Mariana and as she was now losing the fight with gravity I decide we should go home via the hotdog seller to have Swedish sausage in a bun.

We leave Beeros and Marie to it and I half carry half walk Mariana home where we both pass out pretty instantly."

Uneventful day really. Got up late to avoid the hangover. Went to wander round the shops with Mariana in the afternoon. 
Wandered over to her dads place for an evening meal - more Christmas food! He was quite ill unfortunately. Had managed to catch a bad cold from James who is Marlins boyfriend. Marlin is another sister who lives with James in Bournemouth. Like us they had flown over to Sweden for Christmas.

We left to go into town after drinking a few cartons of cheap wine with Martina and a friend. We tried to get into a couple of places but the bouncers would not let Martina in without ID. In fact Mariana had to go back to our place to pick her ID up as they wouldn't let her in either.

It was decided to try and get Martina in using Marianas passport. So Mariana and I wandered in to the same place we were the day before (Bar Billiard), got a drink and sat down. About 20mins later the bouncer comes up to us and throws us out for trying to get Martina in. As it turns out she was quite lucky not to have her passport and ID card confiscated.

Martina and friend went home and we went to another pub. That was the end of the night really."

I should point out that Marie is painfully thin and my Mrs has already comented on how she used to be able to borrow Maries clothes but now she is too fat. Uh oh.... 

Anyway at about 11 we get picked up by Johakim who is Lindas boyfriend. Linda is another sister and the non identical twin of Marie. So armed with presents we all jump in to the stereotypical 15 year old Volvo estate (you are nothing in Sweden unless you drive a Volvo or a Saab) and go to Marianas Dads appartment. Bo Johansson is separated from his wife and lives with another of Marianas sisters called Martina and her younger brother Linus (pronounced Leenus). 

From my observations so far most people in Sweden live in fairly modest appartments. Halmstad certainly has a lot of 3 - 5 storey buildings which are all blocks of appartments. In fact there are very few single houses around. Apparently it's not unusual for a family of 4 or 5 to share a two bedroom apartment. The living room is often a third bedroom. Bo's place seems to be a fairly large appartment, 3 bedrooms, a large living room, a kitchen / diner and a bathroom. 

We aren't there long before we leave to go and see Marianas mother who lives in the next appartment block. Mariana doesn't seem to get on with her mother. I found her to be perfectly nice but Mariana is short tempered with her. Her manerisms and body language make it perfectly obvious she doesn't want to be there. It's the only time I have seen Mariana like this. 
We exchange gifts, drink non alchoholic Swedish grog (a sort of wine with spices in it) and return to Pappa Bo's place. Later 10 of us squeeze around a table designed for 4 people and eat. Lots. All kinds of sausages, fish, ham and various vegetables. Something called Jasons Temptation is served - a kind of potatoe bake that I couldn't get enough of!

Shortly after dinner I got to do the one thing I've always wanted to do for 28 years of my life - open my presents on Christmas Eve! Cool! 

We all left about 11ish very full and tired. The end of a really nice Swedish family Christmas."

Ok - thats about the limit of my written swedish anyway.

It's cool over here - can't write much now just to say that I hope you all had a good one and I will fill you all in when I return.

I am in Halmstad by the way which is south of Gothenburg - it snowed when I got here on the Tuesday which was really nice but its all melted now - raining and cold - a bit like the weather back home I guess....

Have a fantastic break for Christmas one and all. I will try to check / update my journal when I'm out there.

TTFN."

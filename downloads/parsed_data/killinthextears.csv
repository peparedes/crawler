1) When does liking someone a lot become loving that person? <b>When you start thinking about them romantically.</b>
2) Is there a job you would do for free, and is it your current job? <b>Not that i know of.</b>
3) What is one person/thing that inspired you to take action of some sort? <b>My cousin.</b>
4) Though you might not believe in it, would you like fate to exist? <b>I dont really know.</b>
5) What's the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for you? <b>Too long ago to remember...</b>

I just opened my site on the 14th of this month. I already feel like closing it, theres nothing exciting about it anymore. Feels like a chore to update, no one goes there really.. So why bother? Tell me. Its like the era of everyone closing, and the new ones taking over. Ill bet you there will be someone like Ashley from Decollate.org, or Ignite.nu some day. Were all dying off it seems. But I might close and come back when things pick up for me. Who knows, maybe I wont, maybe Ill move and get myself a life. I have plans on going to California in March, Ill probably look at the colleges there and who knows maybe Ill apply to one.

no offence to either of you but through all of practice you both talked to me a total of <b>3</b> times!  you keep dissapearing together-- [like after practice without even saying goodbye]

idk i'm prolly just being pre- menstral but it's really getting to me.  

ugh whatever. keegan makes me happy-- so if you guys aren't going to talk to me then i'm <b>really</b> going to ignore you and you can just deal with it-- otherwize MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL ME WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!

idk maybe we were both just trying to keep the mood up but it still seemed so .... superficial.  

....i know today was such a hard day for her.....and i hate that i can't share her pain... but i really don't understand the kind of loss she's feeling-- especially with the way i feel about <i>death</i> in peticular.


i don't know.  this week has been confusing and stressful and blah...
all i can say is right now i'm sort of glad i fell asleep tuesday afternoon but at the same time... i still wish i had gone through with it...

i don't know... i can't really think right now. its late. i'm tired.

last night was good. keegan is awsome. lol we fell asleep on dani's chair together- and then he had to walk home in the dark alone. =(
i like keeping things slow. it gives me room to fall into everything easier. [that prolly didn't make sence to a lot of ppl ] oh well..

anways... today seems depressing... 
 
lol but dani and i are going to the art museum and a dentist appointment!! so i guess the day is not lost yet.

"event","jessicka is gone.

she has been replaced with something new.

this something new is bigger and better than before.

you would not recognize her if you saw her.


you will tell her that you miss her.

you will tell her that she should ""come home"".

what you do not realize that this is selfish and short sighted,

as change is crucial to provide a frame of reference from which to learn.


some of you were left on poor terms.

you had unresolved grievances that seemed all too important to you whenever she was around.

they dictated the tone of your attitude and the course of your behavior.

say your paths were to cross again, though, in five, ten years time.

will you see by then just how trivial these matters were?


some of you took her for granted.

you assumed she would always be there, to be counted on.., to be relied on.

you perhaps did not make the most of what time you had to share with her.

now that time has run out, and you are left alone.

words left unspoken.

experiences left unlived.


take this opportunity to consider those you call friends (or foes).

reflect upon what they really mean to you.

realize that you have something to offer each other,

and do not wait for them to be gone to consider what you can learn about yourself through them."

"event","This weekend: DOG SITTING!! Dad is outta town, so I offered to take care of dear sweet Bernard. We were up until 2 am last night trying to go to sleep- he was excited by his new surroundings. After three hours of sleep, we woke up again and went outside for a little walk. You can't ignore nature's call. Having Bernard here is a little adventure, since 1992 was the last time I had a dog in the house. Of course, I was only seven years old at the time and did not have to assume the responsibilities of the caretaker. Walking the dog, feeding him, disciplining him, etc, is a whole new ball game for me. And I'm loving every minute of it."

"event","You gotta love people who don't like to eat anything colored, for example, buttercream frosting tinted pastel pink and pastel green. In my opinion, mint chocolate chip icecream that isn't green just isn't worth eating. On the flip side, I've never found anything colored/flavored blue raspberry particularly appetizing. Is there such a thing as a blue raspberry? 

Surely, the woman meant ARTIFICIAL color. I'm imagining a plate of only white food...potatoes, rice, cottage cheese, pasta, coconut flakes...feel free to add to the list"

I signed A Chi O. Now that I've been to 2 events at the house already, I know that I honestly could not be in a better sorority or have a better pledge class. Last night I went to the new pledge barbecue and sang karaoke- that's right, I said karaoke. I love karaoke...or shall i say, Caraoke (BOO). Anyway, I'm having a blast as a Greek.

**Sigh of relief and contentment:** Rush is over. I'm pledging. I am so proud to be an A Chi O..

"event","<P>Know how I said that I had a lot to accomplish at the end of that last entry? That was an understatement!</P>
<P>How can I best summarize what's been going down? Let's start with classes.....</P>
<P><U>Classes</U></P>
<P>I'm not terribly inspired by any of my classes this semester. Class Piano, so far, is simple and relaxing. Music Theory is....special. Sometimes I think that our teacher doesn't know what he's talking about. All the other classes have actually learned a great deal of new material, whereas we have maybe read one new chapter and have reviewed old stuff for the past two weeks. Music history wins the prize for Most Interesting Class. Lecture is lively and&nbsp;the reading is interesting (except when I'm tired and it's late at night). Orchestra has gone well, although the parts are building up. I desparately want to be prepared for this competition in April, but I don't know if that is going to happen....I'm trying to learn the music as quickly and efficiently as possibly. This is hard, however, when you're trying to learn three of the most difficult pieces in harp repertoire. </P>
<P><U>Greek</U></P>
<P>I came to school with the intention of rushing. I wasn't sure that I'd pledge...but I knew that if I never checked out the Greek System I would regret it. On Labor Day, my close friends and I went to 5 open houses. The day was intense- we socialized with complete strangers from 1 pm to 9 pm. My entire week revolved around open houses and invite parties. The next week, our emotions ran high while we all waited for invitations to Pref Parties. When it came closer and closer to final invite parties and then bid day, things became strained. For some people that I know who were positive that they wanted to go Greek, the whole rush process did not work out as they had anticipated. It seemed odd to me that I came in not even sure if I'd pledge. And yet, there I was, completely gung ho about joining a sorority and even living in the house. The&nbsp;Greeks that I favored were Alpha Chi Omega and Kappa Alpha Theta. Bid day came...and I got bids from both houses. The decision for me was so difficult....the Theta girls had been so active in courting me, and I had grown particularly close to one senior. My conversations with the girls that I had befriended over the past weeks at the Theta pref night really touched me...it had a lasting impression. They genuinely cared about me, and this was special. On the other hand, A Chi O felt like the house for me, and i knew that sympathies there were the same. As happy as I was to get bids from both, in a way I wished that I only had one bid so I wouldn't have to decide....I went with my first instincts and signed A Chi O.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ok, I'm dead tired, so I'm just&nbsp;gonna break here and pick up tomorrow, ya?</P>
<P>thanks. </P>"

<P><FONT color=#ff0000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that our freshmen programs this week were very successful, particularly the dance we sponsored on Saturday night. In fact, I've really enjoyed this whole week working with RHA, and am considering applying for an At Large position on the General Assembly if Greef Life doesn't appeal to me.

"event","<P>What if it became cool to use a baby carrier like a purse?</P>
<P>Ya know, it seems like everyone is getting pregnant- Adults in my world and Hollywood. Maternity stores have introduced more stylish clothing for moms-to-be. It's like pregnancy is a trend now. </P>
<P>I'm not really sure why I'm writing about this, it's just something that crossed my mind. I think it actually started when I was going into a restaurant the other day and saw this girl about my age carrying a baby in a carrier. The way she held the carrier startled me...she swung it around as if it was empty. I wanted to run up to her and remind her that she had a LIVE PERSON inside that massive, cumbersome plastic thing.
So then, I got pictures developed from the xmas holiday (I'm horrible about having film developed). Several of them were of my aunt's and my cousin's wife's (I dont know what you'd call that relation..cousin in law?) babies. I go to those family functions and feel so left out. The ages are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum: Adults over the age of 38, and children under 3. Then, there is me: 18. Conversations involve babies: Taking care of babies, what the baby said the other day, lalalala. Don't get me wrong, here. I love children. I coached swim team for two years and wanted to take some of those kids home. Most importantly, I love my family. But it made me think, and then decide: I know that having children involves sacrifices, but it does not mean that I must remove myself from the Real World and permanently enter Baby Universe when I am a Mom.  Not this seems so obvious, but when I think this over, I've really only interacted with new mothers in the past two years. Before that, the whole new parenthood thing was completely foreign. 

So am I redy for kids? Not yet, but I do have an idea of what names I like :-)."

On our way home, I suggested that we stop by Trinity, my old Middle School, just for kicks. It's changed a great deal since I left there in '99. The nuns who owned the property sold much of it to Ryland Homes. Additionally, the building that I used for my classes from 5-8 grade is now used for administrative offices. The convent that stood on the hill was leveled, and a new middle school and cafeteria stand in its place. Anyway, we were driving up past the gym, when I noticed a bunch of old desks that ""my generation used back in the day of Old Trinity"" next to a dunpster, there for the taking. Obviously, I took one, and I made sure that it had tons of writing on the table top part. I took it to my room at Dad's house... I thought this might be nice, since he went to Trinity for elementary school and middle school. A few years ago, I gave him this wooden chair from the convent that he used when he was a boy. Now, I have a desk. Isn't it nice to take home some of your past?</FONT>"

<P><FONT color=#33cc00 size=4><STRONG>I love the Royal Farms on Key Highway.&nbsp;It's nothing fancy, just a massive quickie mart where you can also get gas.....but I associate it with so many good memories. I went there this morning to grab some coffee, which by the way,&nbsp;I rate as better-than-average.&nbsp;As usual, it smelled of baking doughnuts and music was blaring out into the parking lot (Bob Marley today). For some reason, I began to recall the first time I ever went there. It was on one of the many snow days we had during the winter of 2003. My mom and step-dad and I decided that we should go to the DSC to shovel some of the snow off the docks and boats. After laboring in the freezing cold for an hour, we decided to stop at the Royal Farms to warm up. This was all fine and dandy until our car wouldn't start. Oddly, we didn't worry, it was actually kind of funny. Some guy who had parked next to us gave us a hot shot. Then, we took a nice, long drive. This is just one of those nice memories of home you have...I don't know what makes it so comforting. I frequent that Royal Farms. It's&nbsp; favorite place to stop before and after work. And although work has dominated,&nbsp;but has&nbsp;not been the highlight of my summer, thinking about all those times I stopped there for coffee at the crack of dawn, or for&nbsp;gas all dressed up and in a hurry to meet my friends, my work memories don't seem sooo bad. The humor&nbsp;of my gym-experience this summer is more prominent in my mind than the drudgery. A good way to finish off my job, since next week will be my last at Tide Point. :-)</STRONG></FONT></P>"

"event","<P><EM><FONT color=#3333ff>My vacation ended quite unexpectedly. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#3333ff>On&nbsp;Friday morning,&nbsp;we began having problems with one of the cars that we brought down. It wouldn't start. Long story short, we ended up having it toed to a near by garage&nbsp;that could replace the starter, and then picked it up&nbsp;that afternoon. We returned back to the condo late and decided to pack a few things and load one of the cars so we could avoid the morning rush. Unfortunately, when we went out to the car that had supposedly been fixed, it again wouldn't start. Great. It's midnight of the day we have to leave, and the car pooped out on us again. The only solution was to call AAA, get a hot shot and leave RIGHT THEN. That's what we ended up doing. I quickly packed the rest of my stuff, loaded the cars, and in two hours, AAA came, and we were on the road back to Baltimore. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#3333ff>So, now I'm home. I'm slowly unpacking and easing myself back into practicing. I feel like I never left....as though those two weeks were suspended in time. Fortunately, I'm going back to the beach this weekend for Aly's birthday, which of course will be an excellent time. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#3333ff>Until later....</FONT></EM></P>"

<P><FONT color=#6600cc><EM>It's my last day at the beach, and its beautiful out. My feelings about leaving are ambivalent. I'm not ready to leave the ""vacation mode,"" however, I am looking forward to shopping for school and coming back the beach next weekend with my friends. As I mentioned earlier, the Family occasionally becomes a bit grating. When I get home, I'll have a little more friend-time, so to speak. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc><EM>I'm desparately hoping that this school year is not as stressful as last year. Part of the stress was my fault, but most of it resulted from the pressures of my major. Sometimes, I feel like that the Big-People-In-Charge in my dept. don't think that we have lives other than music. Their thoughts aren't completely false. I know some people who have only done music and never any other activity, still only do music, and only want to do music. I'm the complete opposite. Although I'm&nbsp;on a high level with my art, &nbsp;I want to get involved in other communities at the University, specifically, the Greek community. I'm rushing the first week of school. It may end not not being my thing, but if I don't experiment, I know that I'll always wonder.</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc><EM>Yet again,&nbsp;when I compare my interests to that of my peers in my major, I begin questioning what career path is right&nbsp;for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;They have one interest, or their interest is so strong that it dominates everything else. I have&nbsp;diverse interests. I like being a ""diverse person."" I don't want to&nbsp;focus on ONE&nbsp;thing.&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;explore those other sides of who I am. I had a conversation with&nbsp;one of my music&nbsp;friends a long time ago.&nbsp;He told me that&nbsp;he&nbsp;had never considered a career in anything other than music. Interest in anything other than music did not exsist, and furthermore, there was no desire to explore anything other than music. To me, this was sad. In my opinion, there is so much in the world and in the mind of a single person. Why not explore every facet of who you are and your surroundings? My friend could have cared less. He was content with focusing on one area. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. I'm just confident that I'm not satisfied knowing only one part of myself. </EM></FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><EM>Ever felt completely overwhelmed?</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><EM>&nbsp;Beginning last night, I began feeling a bit annoyed with my family. Not that I'm not having a nice time- it's been a lovely vacation. I am fortunate, in that I have&nbsp;relaxed parents and grandparents. Yet, I sometimes cannot help but feel the need for some alone time. I know that they haven't changed over the years. It's me who has changed. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><EM>I guess it really started last night. No one said anything offensive...I can't describe the feeling that began to build, but it was one of impatience.&nbsp;My tolerance for&nbsp;their&nbsp;idiosyncracies&nbsp;lowered. I woke up this morning in a bad mood, and tried my best to cover it. It finally hit its peak today, when we were having a benign conversation on the beach&nbsp;about plans for the fall. I&nbsp;got up, and said, ""I'll be back,"" and began walking down the beach.&nbsp;After about 15 minutes, I felt centered again, so I turned back. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><EM>Everything has been fine since then...I only wish I could identify&nbsp;the thing&nbsp;that triggered that sour mood. I know that I haven't changed for the worse.&nbsp;As my Mom joked when I returned from first year at college, ""She turned out real nice, didn't she?"" My family hasn't been smothering, either. They've done well giving me my own space this summer. I guess that everyone goes through a period of growth where their family becomes slightly grating. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=4><EM>Sorry about this terribly directionless, open ended entry. I had to vent. Thanks. </EM></FONT></P>"

<P>I bet you're wondering what could have possibly provoked this question.&nbsp;Observe the following terms/statements:</P>
<P>1) ""Dorchestra,"" pronounced Dork-estra. It pertains to the dorks in orchestra, in case you couldnt figure that one out. </P>
<P>2) ""I'm a huge Band Geek."" I was never in band. Rather, I was and am in dorchestra. </P>
<P>3) ""You're a nerd."" This has been said to me on a few occasions, and is often followed by, ""over-achiever."" Is over-achiever&nbsp;synonomous with&nbsp;nerddom?</P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff6666 size=4>It rained yet again, and then stopped. Unfortunately, the sun never came out. I still went to the beach- I thought it might be nice to get in the ocean, and maybe take a run. When I got down by the water, I found dead fish strewn all over the shore. They were completely in tact, no cuts or anything, and were about 10 inches long...and smelled just as rank as it looked. In fact, the odor completely permeated the beach air. According to the life guard,&nbsp;a sudden change in the water temperature (which, I assume resulted from&nbsp;Alex)&nbsp;caused a major fish&nbsp;kill.&nbsp; I whipped out my surgical gloves, picked some of those dead suckers up, started a bonfire and had a huge seafood feast. Syke. I practically gagged when I saw those things lying there on the sand. Bluhgh. </FONT></EM></P>

<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=4><EM>This morning was disgusting, but those clouds burned off around 11 am and we had sunshine! After missing a day of beach, today meant serious surf time. Of course, because there is a storm off the coast, there was a bit of a current, but that's what I look for- you'll have beautiful waves for the most part. Later, however, it became a little choppy and unpredictable (not that the ocean is predictable to begin with, but, ya get my gist). Ew, and there were dead fish floating around....tasty. Oddly enough, I feel much better after spending the day in the water. My cold seems like its almost gone, but I'm going to continue being careful and monitoring my throat. </EM></FONT></P>

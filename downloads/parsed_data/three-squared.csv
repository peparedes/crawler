"event","I really ought to update this thing more often...

Well, here's a brief lowdown just for the time being:

Zero hour for the convention approaches... My brother and dad are landing at Pearson tomorrow at elevenish, and I'm getting ready to put the finishing touches on a comission piece I was hired to do for a friend. 

I'm making one of these: http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7ac/screens/ff7ac058.jpg

A friend of a friend is cosplaying as Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy: Advent Children, and he needs the honking big buster sword to complete the outfit. I hope it looks good!

In other construction news, I finally picked up the aluminium road case from above all and broke the bank to install casters on it. So now Eximworks has its own roadcase/dolly for conventions, shows and film shoots. Woo hoo!

I just need to clean it with paint stripper and stencil some text on. Chances are it will be used mostly as a skateboard, but there's nothing wrong with that.

Rebecca's cousin, Dave Elias showed me some leather bracelets he was making and got me addicted to nylon strapping, available at Mountain Equipment Co-Op for 90 cents per metre. So far I've made a striking red/black belt, a purple/black bracelet, and the strap for an articulated leather shoulder guard, all of which will be up for grabs at the con. Tomorrow or possibly the next day I hope to do another capital findings run to pick up some buckles and a snapsetter, and then it will be rush rush rush to get pieces ready in time. 

Can you tell I'm stoked?"

"event","This is just freaking great. It's the 3rd today and I'm $150 short on rent, without considering ancillary expenses such as food, laundry and transit. Not to mention the phone and cable bills I'm terrified to even look at. 

The convention at the end of this month is looking more like an agonizing necessity than a chance for me to have fun. I doubt even the return on that will cover the expenses that will be incurred by that point. This is exactly the reason why I don't get a credit card, because I know that I would dig myself into a bottomless debt pit that my credit rating would never escape from. 

Anyway, I'm going to go rat around my apartment and look for shit I can sell."

"event","Day 1 of 2 off this week, and my ma (in Toronto for the remainder of the month) loaned me $200 to purchase supplies for the upcoming <a href=""http://www.hobbystar.com/ComicConTorontoV2/CC_Main.asp"" target=""blank"">Canadian National Expo</a>. The haul? Blank shirts, virgin sketchbooks, an art portfolio and some assorted hardware. This leaves only raw leather and some metal fixtures to pick up at capital findings, hopefully with Joe sometime this week.

For anyone who wants custom sketchbooks, now is the time to sing out!

Oh right, about the subject line... I baked a kick ass apple pie today and installed some taps on my dancing shoes. Time to SLIIIIIIDE!

I have Silverfawx to thank for my ride arount town (woot!) and after the shopping was done, we sat down to watch a totally screwed up movie; <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314063/"">Immortel</a>. It was so wierd because half the characters were fully CGI, and the other half were actors. I think it might have had some sort of aesthetic reason... In any event, it was a really beautiful french sci-fi shot in english language with a atmosphere reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/"">The Fifth Element</a>. The basic outline is that Horus (the Egyptian God) descends onto AD 2095 New York in search of a blue-haired proto-human woman named Jill who he must procreate with by means of a human male named Nikopol, who happens to be a famous revolutionary thawed out after 30 years in cryogenic hybernation. And then it gets wierd. Keep a look out for the ""Tycho Brahe"" graffiti. I guess they really dig <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com"">Penny Arcade</a> in France.

Speaking of other strange movies, I got a screener copy of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373981/"">""Kontroll""</a>, a hungarian thriller/comedy about ticket inspectors on a European subway system. The ending was kind of inconclusive, but overall I found it reasonably entertaining. There were enough little moments to make it worth the watch.

That's all for now until my next post... ""God's mercy on you swine!"""

I'm just waiting for the GF and her gang to come visit me after sending off our Japan-bound friend Elisa. I should have told her to yell ""God's mercy on you swine!"" from the plane... I know I did at least twice during my trip to San Diego."

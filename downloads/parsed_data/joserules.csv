"event","its been too long. ANNIE IS BACK WOO HOO!

Ok, back to old business. A lot of stuff has happened and because Ive lagged, I know im going to leave abunch of stuff of of work but oh well... here we go.

Noodles got a mongolian haircut, dont know if I've mentioned this already but he did. Basically, his whole head is bald except for a square patch that wasnt cut in the back of his head, near the top. Its interesting but now he thinks he's a  target. For example, I was down delivering material in King City and an electrician asks he if I saw any Nortenos rolling into town. I was like wtf are u guys talking about, but in my head. So i gave em my material and left thinking nothing more than fuck those electricians really are crazy. Next day I come back and they tell me the same thing but this time Im like wtf are u guys talking about. SO they tell me this story that Noodles was there and Dave pulled his hat off and he got all pissed and mad, cuz he saw a bunch of alleged nortenos coing into town and they would kick his ass  if they saw him with that haircut, but he was being completly serious. Me and Osk just laughed, and were like yea right probably some paisas. So when I get back into the shop Im like hey Noodles seen any nortenos lately.

Someone sent chuckie the elctrcian into the shop to look for materials. Among the listed items was a 24 pack of miller lite. Anyway, he looked lost and kept looking throiugh catalogs. Hes all like fuck man I cant find this item, he gave me the code but didnt tell me what brand if it was leviton or caddy or what. They asked to see it.. the code number was written funny but the message was clear, it was a ""ID-10-T""... so Bom tells him hey man it looks liek someone was looking for an Idiot and they found one. Man was Chuckles pissed after that. But it was great.

I gotta g d some stuff now I may update later"

"event","So i left off A Noodles story for friday... well, first of all, he's doing a good job at work so its hard to find something funny but ill kick in a few things here or there

Yesterday I went to the San Jo flea market and scored a sweet SNES, and then later went to EB in Sand City and scored The Lion King. yea I know i know, i rock. But seriously, i do. Anyway, while at the flea market im walking through the fruit section and its out in the open but covered by a tarp high abnove the stands.. reminding me of a place in mexico. So my younger bro Tony is next to me and I tell him ""man this reminds me of mexico"" and he says ""why cuz of all the flies and bugs on the food"" haha, not funny. THEN, we were leaving the flea market and I guess someone had a baby lying on their couter, kicking its feet and arms into the air.  And I hear my other bro Adan say man what is that it looks so real. No shit sherlock, it's a real baby. Come on kid. It was funny, I guess I could see how he thought it was some toy one, since it seemed like it was unattended and stuff. Damn kids.

The new guy at work.. have I given him a name. I think I have. his real name is carlos i think i forgot it last time. I am pretty sick right now, and thus even MORE lazy than normal, so I wont bother to look back.. but was it ralphie? I feel like it was ralphie. Well, I was trying to teach him a few things, and we were driving the 1 ton, my favorite vehicle. I told him to be good to her and to make sure to only feed her DIESEL fuel. It says on the gas meter, DIESEL ONLY, on the gas cap it says DIESEL ONLY, the engine is loud, like a DIESEL. Many a signs that this is indeed a DIESEL driven vehicle. Noodles has been working for this company for how long again? SO anyway, i guess he put GASOLINE into it one time and it took 1 ton outta commission, till she had her stomach pumped. So yeah, I basically told him not to pull a noodles.

Noodles once swore he could eat 25 tacos from the taco truck aka roach coach, that stops right by us on thursday and fridays. Billy Goat and Osk said no way holmes and he said yes way. they said DO IT, if you finish it we'll pick up the tab. Noodles, not using his Noodle, had a snack at 10. Come lunch time, he almost had it... he was done at 22. Had it not been for that snack, he would done it. And this began a series of challenges, testing the endurance of the Noodles stomach in a celebration that came to be known as the Noodles Challenge. Further events consisted of eating 10 habaneros (he was out of work for 2 days after that), chigging a gallon of milk (out for the rest of the day). Thus Uncle Rick said he couldn't do Noodles challenges anymore until after work and on Fridays, so coudl ahev the weekend to recover.

I asked him what he was doign for cash when he was out for room... his mom was paying him money to clena his room...... yep......

Man whats a good rememdy for the common cold.. i think i have a cold. runy nose, scratchy throat, sneezing, tightness in head and chest, no fever... cold right? right? Makes me feel weak and tired but yet I type and type and type and type.

Can anyone get me SNES accessories/games at cost?"

"event","Yes ladies and gentlemen Noodles did indeed return to work today. And we got a new employee named... i dont remember lets call him Ralphie. Suprisingly, and much to my disappointment, nothing funny happened. Scott, an electrician, is always trying to give people wet whilies or kisses on their heads.. yea a weirdo. So anyway everytime he tries to talk to me I move so there is always at least 6 feets of distance between us. It cracks me ups so whenever he comes by im always smiling so he says hes calling me smilie now... lol. fucken ralphie and noodles and best buds now too, its great. and i gave my two weeks notice, much to their surprise. what do u expect when u fuckers pay me 8 an hour and make me work all crazy sometimes. anyway yea. i think ill go back in time and u can hear a noodles story.

so one day billy goat wants a subway sub so he sends noodles to get him one, since noodles volunteers. he gives him a list, very specific. billy goat cant stand mustard or onions, if it even touches something he cant eat it. so noods leaves and comeas back. nilly examines the sub and finds it has like EVERYTHING it. when he confronts noodles he syas ""duyde i dot know man i just told em to put everything on it"" Bill is furious, he couldnt even read off a list. hes so mad he takes his sub, still wrapped and whole and chucks it into the garbage. WELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL, noodles didnt bring a lunch that day.. ahaha u see where this is going., he pulls it out and starts muching down on it, and bill can tbelieve it.... tomorrow ill tell another noodles story. im out"

"event","My brothers said it was cliche to say ""thats so cliche."" Is he right?

Well I decided to begin updating this thing maybe, and I think it will revolve around my job. Let's begin with what happened today.

Hella drama today. Bill, my supervisor, was pulled into like 50 meetings today by his supervisor, Roland, and  coowner Rick aka Uncle Rick. So a few weeks back, Uncle Rick's kid Eric aka Noodles quit working in a hella dramatic scene. He told Steve, head of the projects department, to fuck off and he stormed off in his shitty ass blazer. His dad came to the back, beet red, proclaiming that Noodles was done working there and done living in his house. See this kid has been working there forever, doesnt go to school, mommy and daddy give him everythig so it was hilarious. After 3 days, noodles came back home to mommy and daddy, I guess his buddies got sick of him mooching. But now that hes just at home doing nothing Rick wants him back, even though everyone is saying NO, cuz he was lazy, a terrible worker, and just got in the way. So Rick, Linda (human resources, married to Chris), Chris (other owner), Roland, and Bill are meeting about all this and Im just being told to leave and do such and such things and yea. SO Rick tells Bill to call Noodles and tell him hes back but then when Rick goes to the police department to straighten shit up with his daughter (a great father huh) Bill is about to call and Chris and Linda say he cant. SO Bill is feeling all hurt that they dont respect him and hes all fuck thsi im quitting im going to work for CED, our main supplier of electrical goods. and Im just listening going yea dude get the fuck outta here fuck this shit. It's all hilarious to me.

Tomorrow Noodles and a new guy will being. With Noodles back there's no telling what funny shit will happen. I need to go back and say more great Noodle moments but alas another day another time. IM done for now."

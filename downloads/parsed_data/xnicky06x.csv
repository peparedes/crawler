"event","well the weekend is done. just another full week of all my friends being away somewhere on vaca while in stuck at home with a big thing of ice cream (chocolate chip cookie dough to be exact) and movies like a walk to remember, the notebook, benny and joon, and those types of things. well if you are that much of an idiot and haven't realized what happened alex dumped me...friday night....that was fun. oh my god i was a mess. still am. i mean its bad when you watch boy meets world and you see topaenga and cory together and i cry my eyes out, or i had this breakfast thing to go to this morning and i just couldn't get him off my mind and i had to excuse myself so i could go to the bathroom so that i didn't cry in front of a huge crown of people.... or worst of all that everynight i go to sleep in his boxers and his sweatshirt and the bear he gave me with my phone right next to me hoping that he will call me and say baby i coulnd't sleep and i had to talk to you. but nope. not yet. not ever. he wants different things. he wants to be single and shit cuz apparently i wasn't good enough for him. but hey. who knows... i mean i just hate it how hes like not affected at all. i mean he told me and he was fine. he hung out with his friends and he was fine. he'll go talk to a girl and be fine. i can't even look at guys right now. i mean i just hate it that no matter what i do i think of him. oh im all alone in my room thinkin of nothin..splash..there goes the freakin waterworks....there i go cryin again over a guy. and the sad thing....i thought that he actually loved me. i mean i really did. i look back at all the shit we've done and made and created. ill look at this shit on my phone that we made and i just can't breath. a song that i have dedicated to him will go on the radio and i just start crying. but i thought that he loved me. we had this song ""come what may"" and i thought that no matter what happened or how bad things got that we could hum it and everything will be ok..everything is better. but its not. i have played that song over and over again and NOTHING is ok. i am still crying here over him and he is still probably fast asleep thinkin of how many numbers he can get the next day. well i guess i have rambled on enough. leave a comment and let me feel loved again....ttyl..g'night"

"event","oh my god. today was seriously the best day of my entire life. im guna start this with a HUGE thank you to my baby cuz without him today would have been horrible. well we went to chuckie cheese and we had a freakin blast. we went in the tubes, we went under the little kids house, we played games, we got tickets, we took pictures...omg it was awesome! then i came home and cleaned up my house so that i could go out and then i talked to my baby, he talked to his mom, and they came to my house and picked me up and i went to his house. then we watched moulin rouge! one of my fav movies! but during that we had the BEST time. i got the best candy a girl could want. he is soooooo good. i love him soo much. this next part is for you baby.

baby, i know i got a little freaked out earlier when you mentioned your ex-girlfriend and thats only cuz im jealous....she had you for a whole year and a half. i know what ur guna say, you have me for the rest of your life...i know that and hopefully i will. but i just know that you must have cared about her so much to have gone out with her for so long. and i just hope that she doesn't realize what she lost and want you back and then you get this tough decision...i just love you so much and i am SO afraid of loosing you. i will fight the world so that you are mine. i mean you are my soul-mate. i know that you know this and i know that you love me and everything but im still sooo scared of loosing you. as mandy moore would say ""im scared of not being with you."" and its true. i don't want to to lose you to anything or anyone.  i love you baby with all my heart. im always here for you no matter what! i love you.

Come What May (moulin rouge)
Ewan:
Never knew, I could feel like this,
Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your kiss
Everyday I love you more and more
Listen to my heart, can you hear it sing
Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you, until the end of time

Come what may, come what may
I will love you, until my dying day

Nicole:
Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you

Ewan:
And there's no mountain too high, no river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather,
And stars may collide

Both:
But I love you (I love you)
(un)Til the end of time (Until the end of time)

Come what may, Come what may
I will love you, until my dying day
Oh come what may, come what may
I will love you (I will love you)
Until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Come what may, Come what may
I will love you
Until my dying day(slow down)



that one is all for you baby im guna get goin. love ya guys

One day a blonde is driving home when she rear-ends a man in his truck. The man stops and yells at her to get out of her car, so she steps out and tries to apologize.

He then draws a circle in the sand and tells her to stand inside and not to step out. He goes to his truck, takes out a baseball bat, walks over to her car, and smashes in the window.

She begins to giggle, so he looks back at her angrily and tells her to be quiet. Then he starts beating in the hood of her car.

She giggles again, and he turns to her and says, ""You're askin' for it, lady!"" Then he smashes in her windshield.

By this time the blonde is laughing hysterically, so he looks at her and yells, ""What's so funny!?""

She laughs again and replies, ""While you weren't looking I stepped out of the circle three times.""


LOL....so do you think that its kinda me? hee hee hee...i guess it is. i would laugh too...well ill ttyl..bye guys."

Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by
cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they passed a trial. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.


The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples."" The king then explained the trial to him. ""You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten.""

The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed.


The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.

The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, ""Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?"" The second one replied, ""I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples.""

isn't it good! lol...i knew it was! lol...ill ttyl..leave a comment! please...so that i know that im loved! scroll down..nikki is the only one who leaves comments! i love her...the ones with my list are my favorite! ttyl g'night guys!

"event","well nothin new...im missin him like crazy. idk. i've been thinkin  a lot lately and i need to find someone new so that i can get my mind off of him. theres a song by, yes him, eminem that i can very much relate to...this is it...
Women Singing:
Ain't no one special, special like you
No one's special, special like you (3X)
I been searching, but you're the one I want in my life baby (4X)

Verse 1: Eminem
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you're all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a
touch
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby)
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found

CHORUS
Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X)

Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie

CHORUS
Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (8X)
(fades) No one special, special like you (2X)


well thats it. if you don't know who im talkin about ask me and ill tell ya. i really need to find a new guy to help me! anyone willing to help? any volunteers? meh..idk..i guess ill ust wait.

"event","well today was weird but i think i like it. i got to school like just on time. i walked in the door and heard the bell. so i guess i could be optimistic and say that it was a good thing instead of me being late. school wasn't bad. A Block was well A Block...history with Mr Dabalsi! crazy. i think today we talked about the dakotas and why they are pointless. (thanks nikki for the tip)..B Block was gym...not to bad. they have just waxed the floors so we didn't do anything! the C Block i slept the whole time. we were supposed to take notes but i was tired. then i had lunch. my good friend alfredo vistited me. for those who don't know who that is...thats my mentally challenged friend who ""loves"" me. ""hey buddy..i love you"" thats what he says to me. and he comes over to me at lunch while im eating my poptart or whatever it is that i got that day and he says so what are you doing. and i always reply ""eating""...oh well...i graduate in two years so. (btw don't tell him that because he will flip out). well theni had D Block which is Criminal Justice with todd bates. greatest teacher ever! after school i had yearbook. thats always fun. today i looked thru picture of the seniors of last year. i found some interesing ones. people i didn't know last year but know now..ha ha ha!! max! my little dancing cowboy man! he's to funny. well after school my hypocritical mother interrupted my nap by telling me to go to bed early if i wanted sleep but then she went to go take a nap...ugh! she blaims it on her work cuz she works 6-9 three days a week. oh well..i went downstairs and slept in my sisters room. hee hee hee!!so then my mom went to work and my sister and i put up our lights. my house could not look more ghetto. hahaha! oh well. then icame online and talked to sara. we had a long talk. we talked about a lot of stuff. we have a date next saturday to see if we can work things out between us. she was my BEST friend for like six years and we don't wanna throw that away. so then i work things out with her and then have a guy i have a HUGE crush on tell me he needs time...yeah that hurts but as long as its not to long i think he may be worth the wait. i just hope he knows that i can't wait forever...anyways...onto happier things. i will be babysitting this weekend overnight and getting a lot of money for christmas! yay! (and maybe i can get my nails done) well thats pretty much it. i guess ill get to my movie...a walk to remember!...i love that movie! ttyl guys!

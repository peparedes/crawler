Because I'm waiting for just one phone call so painfully right now, that each one not from the person in question is a dissapointment.  Besides, I am not in possession of cell phone in the evenings: dad is having car problems, and for some reason my brother's cell phone is more important to him right now.  Tomorrow I might decide I am sick and tired to be the good child in the family, and pretend I'm not even in Florida: I would have been in Ithaca right now if I could help it.  Or Tampa."

"event","My battle has began.  On Monday, February 27th Cayuga Medical Center cut off the patients and staff right to smoke.  And three smoking walks were the best fucking thing about any given day there (well, I had some other personal discoveries, but it's neither here nor there).  Going outside together, sharing and passing cigs, watching the smoke, the feeling of comeradery, it was absolutely priceless.  Even my parents saw it, they brought me smokes when I ran out.  So, here's the deal: you choose, what do you want to support, fight against cancer or constitutial rights."

The Secrets Men WISH You Knew-

    Have you ever read a romance novel about a strong-willed woman who met a tough, ""dangerous"" alpha-male man... and over the course of the story, she ""tamed"" him and won him over... and made him fall completely and helplessly in love with her... to the point where he wanted to be with her FOREVER?

And in god forsaken village they abducted a black horse,
And another thing they lifted was a tidy bidy girl,
They put her on the carriage.  They raised her like a gypsy.

And forever she was lost underneath the shade of suntan.
And the only thing she cherishes is her tambourine.
On the way she has forgotton where she came from, where she's going.

"event","I made a professor cry with joy when I just thanked her for what she did for me last fall...  Hm, what an intersting journey that was. She was one of the beacons.  You were another.  It was all about the many little ties to other people back then, twisted into one giant cord that tied me to life.  Good stuff, now I can extend it to everything, and draw my strengh from each human encounter, be it a grumpy bank teller, or someone who wrote a book thousands of years ago.  Life is good. 

And so today I nearly got diagnosed with being maniac on the way of of depression.  Now there was a lesson in assertiveness.  Try to prove to a psychiotrist that you'd much rather go to class in 20 minutes and not be sent on bed rest, and not even in your own (of friend's or friends' bed).  But I did succeed, and even though resenfulness was hard to swollow (they are only looking out for my best interst, they are only looking out for my best interst, they are only looking out for my best interst, you get the idea), I got another proof that I got it right and they just gonna have to deal with me.

So, no shit, there I was, walking out of the Gannett, kinda having trouble loving people, but then I ran into a friend, he is a much older (both age and years ahead) grad from my program, who is terrifically nice and happily married with a sweet kid called Caleb.  So we had a nice walk down the hill (instead of me just taking the bus, and I love walks!), and talked and learned things from one another, which I did not know.  Why do you think Spanish speakers have trouble with his name, Todd?  He said it always comes out as Odd, and we tried to analyze it from what we knew from linguistics.  But nothing like a native speaker!  And then I dropped by his house for few minutes, I played with him, talked to his wife, patted their kitties, learned something new about life, got recharged with energy, and went to my favourite little cafe, Ithaca Bakery, and taught someone quite accedentally a fun tidbit about classics, just because we were nice together and had a small talk chat, and there was a Terra Nostra organic chocolate bar...  And then I ate healthy, studied productively, and then it came a full circle.  Alicia, a Pennsic buddy was passing by, we were very pleased to see each other, and she had a friend with her.  We chatted, they got food, (and were terribly impressed with me translating Plato from Russian to English to them off top of my head), I taught them how Socrates was at this one party talking about all sorts of love, and how there is no bad love, there is just bad way one can choose to love, beautiful stuff I will post on LJ, very nice quote.  And then as they were leaving, we realized that we didn't get each others names with the guy, and his name was Caleb: same as Todd's little kid.  And that's ""built your own Serendipity"" right there!  If I didn't go to councelling again, I wouldn't have run into Todd, and then might have not ended up at Ithaca Bakery, and not met a new intersting person.  I got positive energy from two Calebs today.  Universe laughs again.  The End.

Just changed my email(s) signature, check it out.  (do not under any circumstances search for the song where those lyrics come from.  I will sing it to you myself next time we meet).  I even tossed it all on the official Cornell email.  I will be the sunshine of that department, so those who have a problem with it, better buy shades now.

"event","I might have done something terribly stupid, but hey, it felt good to do this first thing in the morning.

So I was thinking about some of my old bosses, from USF Residence Services, people who taught me few things about life.  But also brought tons of angst to my life and live of my loved ones, and probably lives of many people right now.  And the following email was the result.  Now, will they a) dismiss it now and maybe draw some conclusions years later, b) reply to me now saying I'm a nutter or c) reply to me now with love and appreciation.  Those people are supposed to be professionals at human-to-human thing, they are running dorms, trying to rework those into homes.  But I thought that it's ok now to point out few things that feel like failings.

So, since I send it to a number of people, there is no wrong answer:



""A Heartfelt Thank You"" 
Read at your own risk, I am an adult now, and writing to you as to friends, with no deference except to that of your much more superior life experience than that which I have at my 26.  But as Jane Eye said, it is not the long life and many experiences which make a person wise, but what use they make of them.  I just now started to put mine at good use.

I had an opportunity to realize a thing or two, and I would like to say thank you and share an insight.  Some of you already know everything I will say, but I feel like I need to toss it out there.  Still learning to be assertive, so forgive me to be practicing on you (-:

First of all, I want to thank you for every lesson you gave me, in classroom or by example.  I just now realize that RA class was not the utter waste of my time, but allowed me to think of Multiple Intellegences (even if not by name), and apply some of it to my life, and still apply it even now.  It was very therapeutic, and sometimes kids at 19-22 need to have a chance, need to be forced to do it, if they are in position of authority.

And my insight and confession.  I was a kick ass RA.  You would probably not think of firing me.  But I have done at least 3 things of the top of my head which if you knew about then, would have gotten me utterly completely fired, thrown off campus, you name it (not arrested though, so no fear).

Please love your RA's and let them have their little secrets.  I broke CPR not in sexual but in emotional way, and you know what?  Right now one of my ex residents is a very real possibility for my future whatever, but at least he is such a close friend, that ANYTHING can happened.

Do not punish people for their choices.  Choices make people who they are and arise from mistakes.  Let people confess things they have done wrong to you without reprecussions, because when I was part of RA community, you were sometimes somewhat of a scare crow, a big bad wolf type figures.  I am saying it not to hurt your feelings, but because I finally really appriciate what you taught me and love you well enough to give you some information you will not get from your current dependants.

What I don't mean is not to punish people at all.  I received few very well deserved punishments.  Two in my stay with you, but just and necessary, they taught me some important lessons about my relationships with people.  But be just about it, make sure that you people still trust you and dont fear you, as often is, because some of your rules are actually quite impossible to any real human being to follow.  Very draconial and you seem that much more unapproachable for that.  What do I hear about not being able to have you loved one sleep over anymore in singles???  We are human beings, we deserve our right to lead relationships the way we see if if it NOT hurting anybody but ourselves.  In Magnolia?  How could I have been such a great RA, how could I have given so much love to my residents, if I did not get some sweet lovin' occasionally?  On my own turf?  In my own home?  So choose whether you want to run Res Life as homes or institution, and if you will run it as institution, realize that people will find a way to make it a home, and you will not like it.  So even if you have to have that rule, make sure that there is flexebility inbuilt.

Please feel free to email me at any time, I had this email for 10 years and will as long as Yahoo keeps me, because it is just that important for me to have the knowldge that an old friend may want to try and get a hold of me, and I don't want them met with rejection of a bounced email.  I will like to argue with anything you can bounce back at me, and learn from you more.

Love you,
Learned bunches from you, when you were teaching me, and unbecknownst to you,
Olya

PS, please feel free to share with whomever you'd like (-:  I didn't have a chance to meet some new RDs, new employes who came after my time, or were before my time,

PPS, if someone has Bev's email, please forward it to her, she left you and I didn't have any other way to get a hold of her.  I need to get in touch with her too, she has done tons for me on emotional intellegence level, and I am very appriciative of her, and want to become her adult friend, not a memory of a dependant.

PPPS.  Do you know I was older as an RA than most of RDs?  Did you realize that I was offended than sometimes you treated me like a child and pontificated of things which you knew not, and I knew so much better (say being a bilingual, being an immigrant, whatever), and I allowed you to, and did not honestly let you know and shared my own insight?  I know sencirety has its time an place, that's where tact comes in, but I could have come to your office and corrected something you said in RA class, or at the meeting, or etc...  I did not.  I am sorry.  Thank you, and forgive me as well for whatever I have done wrong in your book.

Let me show you *silly grin*
I will occasionally bounce silly ideas I draw from Plato and Socrates and the bunch, and how it can be applied to SCA in general, and Mushniks in particular, thus using not just the swords and javalins of my heavy duty grammars and vocabulary lists, but gaining a unique perspective into Plato and via him Socrates, making him a real person, and using all my silliness as dirty way of fighting back the Academic Man.  So, it is time for claws and low punches, people, here's assigment number one:

What does the following passage mean and how can it be applied to Mushniks (I can see so many way already, its a gimmik)

So that if we could somewise contrive to have a city or an army composed of lovers and their favorites(1), they could not be better citizens of their country than by thus refraining from all that is base in a mutual rivalry for honor; and such men as these, when fighting side by side, one might almost consider able to make even a little band victorious over all the world.


1. yes, gay lovers, that's exactly what they are talking about, those naughty ancient greeks.


Discuss amongst yourselves.  I will apply your lessons, and one day dedicate a book on Plato that I will one day publish to Mushniks and friends!  

PS, hmmmmmmmmm, I wonder what my proffs will say when I one day will tell them where I am drawing my drive and inspiration from... Hmmmmmmmmmm, SCA is Love."

"event","Silliness is a talent.  Not everybody can pull it off.  I know I am good at it.  It helps me live.  Thank you, my dear mushniks and friends, who taught me the importance of silliness.

I was 100 times more proud when I was made a proto than during my graduation from USF (I kept fretting that I was only one A- away from perfect 4.0 and could have been sitting on stage.  But since I know I coasted a lot at that school,  now I'm greatful to only one professor who did not cut me any slack and instead of just telling me that I need to work on my academic writing, actually penalized me).

Love you!"

"event","There is a lot of ways of looking at life out there.  And I finally was able to internalize the one which is making me happy (and what else can be asked from life).

So I wouldn't bug you down with details, just give you some of the cententia, mottoes, sayings, credo, personal commandments which I am trying to develop for myself, and comments are greatly appriciated.  Nothing is set in stone, there is so much knowledge out there, and if I hit something which will suit me better, I have but myself to decide how I going to fit it into my framework, or how I am going to change this framework based on new information.  (Even though I am in humanities, I am still in Academia, so I have to approach everything in my life, even soul searching) very differently.

In past few days I have been writing more than ever in my life, polishing my ideas by bouncing them of people, whether in conversations, phone conversations, talking and listening, posting and emailing, journaling on paper, word document, or here, you name it.  

I will not explain some background things, if you are lost, feel free to either google, or ask.

Tristan, you were officially the last person I told my dating experiences with bitterness.  It is very hard work to bridge the fiery chasm between bitter and bittersweet, but I'm a quick learner of whatever I put my mind to (hehehe, crocheting projects... mmmmmmmmm)

I did the girl version of High Fidelity: trying to tacle my biggies: it has been easier to forgive, sincerily forgive offences against me, rather than when I feel like guilty party.  Working on not feeling guilty ever, but either stop fretting or fix it.  Succeeding: wrote a long overdue letter to my Gradma in Russia, she really needs it and I felt bad for never doing it.  But I woke up one morning (yesterday) and it was the first time I just wanted to do that rather than feeling obliged, so I did, and expressed mailed it.  Try and do it regulary (well, now I can save 20 bucks and mail regular).  

Celebrating new birth of my confidence, it has been shit for few years now, and when I think back to truly happy, internally happy times of my life, now I draw creative solutions for today's problems.  

Fun game: every time something annoying happens find two ways in which it was a good thing (good luck with that one, Baska, CBL will be a very difficult case).  Forgot waterbottle, don't say, gee, I'm stupid, can't remember anything, but instead: lets treat myself to a yummy drink from Oasis on the way to school.
Forgot to lock front door while home alone: I'm such a looser, could have been robbed/killed: to nope, how good that happened and nothing came out of it, next time I'll be more attentive to it.  

It is very easy to tell someone to ""be assertive, take bad things as learning experinces"" If you don't have practice of doing it, you will never be able to start big.  So training myself to be a more serene and confident person.  Started two days ago, feels good.

Make a list of good things I like about myself, no matter how irrelevant they seem.  Like our talent for silliness.  Find creative ways to apply them to your whatever it is you need to be doing.   Make a list of your ""flaws"" either what you think is a flaw, or what someone else pointed out to you (no matter how hurtful it was at the time).  Do the same.  Rinse, Repeat.

Develop a mantra for yourself, of what you feel you are at the happiest moments of your life, or of every compliment your friends ever payed you:  (mine is arranged from least to most important)
I am young, beautiful, clever, assertive, witty, independent, libirated, self sufficient, talented, assiduous, thoughtful, tactful, successful, creative, friendly, helpful, nice, fantastic, and happy woman and a scholar. 
Now there's a mouthful.  Try memorizing that one!  I'm still rearranging, deleting, adding, you know, working it out.  
Next step:
Repeat until it sinks in.

Come up with your own tune for favourite lyrics.  Come up with new lyrics for favourite toon (I know few people here do that plenty, but I just realized I have the abilities to do it (-;  Maybe not well, but germ is there, all I need is practice.  And it is such a long term skill, that I have all my life to practice. And I am young, and don't have terminal illness (well, I'll try and work on quitting, I think by Pennsic, because I wouldn't want to be dependant on a nicotine fix when I wanna run around doing fun things.  Did tabacco make it to Europe past period?  Or can we prentend to be Vikings who learned the art from Native Americans?)

Enough for now, going to take a bath, read Latin while in it (who said you can only study by your desk?), and then head over to my friends' superbowl party!  Life is exiting being me again :-D

Soul searching trip continues, hope you enjoying the ride (-;"

"event","Hello, my good crew!


                                              His locked, letter'd, braw brass collar
                                              Shew'd him the gentleman an' scholar 
                                                   ""The Twa Dogs,"" st. 6, by Robert Burns (1759-1796).

Finally, by popular demand, updates on Frisky's life.

I'm going through some tough shit right now, and it was much much worse last summer and fall.  Now I'm on a healing bend, and I just want to thank ALL of you first, because SCA was one of very very few places of my life where I was safe and didn't feel worthless or taking up someone elses place in life.

Now, officially Groundhog day is my second birthday: my birthday as a Scholar.  Thank you all who supported me and helped me through that tough birthing process, I had a whole crew of midwives (to take the metaphor to absurd (-:

But thanks to SCA I now developed the confidence in myself outside of school, stopped wrapping my entire identity around schooling, fell in love with my body, know that I am intersting person, because I can open up and be silly with some peole I love, and they don't get annoyed with me :-D

That in turn helped with the school, and now I just wrote a first kick ass paper in my life on Herodotus (I might post details on that, but now to think of it, might be a bad idea, Classicists are NOT above sealing and publishing other people's ideas, and this I think I can publish myself!)  The fantastic feeling of looking at a text which people were studying for 2 thousand 4 hundred years, and seeing something others didn't see in it...  My discipline sometimes burdens me with the overwhealming weight of previous scholarship, but now I think I am qualified to enter the discourse and have something valid to say.

In my next post I think I want to discuss my writing style, which some knock as digressive, but I now think of it as three dimentional, I sculpt my papers and have to draw them on paper before I can put it in liniar format.  My narrative style is akin to that of Herodotus with his ring composition, and to Sheharezade's tales for its story within a story within a story...  You forget who is speaking there are so many levels of remove from the author(s).   

Well, good morning, I want to go read Livy and Socrates's Apology, my assigments for next week.

PS.  I'm buying myself an IPod Nano today!  I deserve to enjoy music anywhere I go, it makes my life better, and it is all about making sure I have small comforts now to confront my make it or break it test in May.  If I fail, I think I gonna move to Indiana.  Their folklore department is THE best in the country!

PPS.
If you know how to say Frisky Weasel in any intersting language, please let me know.  So far I have Russian, Latin, Ancient Greek, and poor rendition of it in French (anyone knows that langauage?  anime bellete, is that right? ).  In Russian it is either Horyok (with weasinling out of stuff connotations), and Laska (homonim of word Tenderness).  In Ancient Greek it is Gale or Galeye, which is one word in the dictionary above a word which yields my mommy's name: Galene, ""calm, serenity, stillness of wind, tranquillity""  What a great word 
So I'm trying to see which version in which language could slip by the heralds and pass for a 14th cent gypsy name (which can be pretty much any area, they always had two, private and for use with ""goim"", so their public names were whatever the range of names is in the area they are in.  I'm thinking Romania, then migrating to Russia (first reference to gypsies in Russian documents is about that time).  This way I can incorporate any aspect of slavic culture I damn well please, I love how gypsies are like magpies, and I'm a packrat, so there we go (-:  ""My favourite colors are blue and shiny"" best thing I accidentally heard in somebody elses passing conversation at Pennsic during shoppies.  
So name is in the works, and so is my emblem: either crochet hook stuck through ball of yarn plus a beer stein, or a weasel and a crochet hook.  I might try to scan in and upload one of my scetches, so you could judge.


PPPS.  I composed my first tune yesterday.  I have this 4 lines memorized, they were given as an epigram to my second year bilingual English (another intersting time in my life, I may share that story another time, it is a good one from my repertuar).  But few years ago I found out they come from a 70's song, rather cheesy they sounded to me, and yesterday I felt so much like that lyrics that I just started repeating it outloud, then saw what tune they would yeild.  I sung it to Becca and Tristan yesterday, you will have to do with just the lyrics (modified from original to fit my meaning and tune better)

Everybody is a star,
I love you 
     to shine on me,
I love you for who you are,
Not for what
       you feel
           you need
                 to be.

Love you guys,
Weasel luving,
Frisky

PPPPS: and that's exactly how I write, digressions, add ons forever, so whoever will be reading my posts: be well advised, I will not controll my natural inclinations in writing and story telling, I have enough trouble organizing my academic writing liniar English Academic Writing style.  I saw a graph once, which showed differnt compositions and sequensing style of academic writing in differnt countries, and english was straight line, intro - point - point - point - conclusion.  French looked like a spiral, they start far from their topic, circumscribe it, start zooming in and wrapping it together, but never overtly stat where they are getting, never give you their thesis statement: that is considred insulting to the readers' intellegence.  Russians start with their topic, then go on a digression which we think illustrates our point , not in direct but in a story telling sort of way, then suddely jump back to the topic, then go on a bigger digression, and then suddenly go back to the conclusion.  So it is more like a ziz-zag, or bunch of free associations, something closer, I think, to the oral cultures: Homeric Singers, Russian Guslyari, Tibetan paper singers, Slam Poetry, SCA 'no shit where I was' stories...  
So back to my main point:  I love you guys, thanks, and I will post from now on (-:

PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPS:
If someone notices a glaring grammar error of style (no spelling, that's what Spell Checker is for, and I didn't run this through) or expression, lemme know, I am trying to become a better, more subtle academic writer and story teller."

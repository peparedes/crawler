Everyone has their own views and are stubborn in the things they believe. We don't believe in the rountines people place before us, and we only attend sessions with the promise of fun. It's hard not to influence the kids, as much as we don't want to. Then again, we may be easily influenced ourselves. That is, only by our friends. Ha! We're the loudest and the live of a party, but the lowest and <em>silent </em>at camps. We don't see how whatever is said on&nbsp;a Friday or&nbsp;a Sunday may be applicable in our lives, but we come anyway. We make stupid comments and do <em>shite </em>stuff, that I wonder&nbsp;if we'll ever regret it. Then again, it's all in the name of fun. And fun is all we need. Fun, laughter, gum and rum. Maybe we'll learn, someday.

Good lots. :D <br /><br />As Alicia puts it, I'm a confused musician. I don't know which is 'my instrument' and I just go around making noise on all the availables. I have jumped three instruments in less than&nbsp;a year. Haha, that is pretty quick! I think it's because I find myself being unable to progress in that particular instrument. I don't know if it's due to a lack of opportunity or whether I'm just not&nbsp;motivated enough to try and&nbsp;improve myself. I would believe it's more of the latter. Sigh. Then again, it may be due to the absence of people in the ministry. Say, when our drummer decides to mia, and the worship leader requests drums, I fill the space. So, right now, I have two choices. Well, somewhat.. 1) Switch back to guitar, and learn to experiment with all the stuffs. This will definitely upset the schedule though. 2) Choose between bass or drums, and stick to it! Must learn steps/riffs&nbsp;and fill-ins respectively! How now brown cow? I will definitely need to replace people still.

Anyhow, these years have seen my struggles to make good music as well as praise. More often than not, we get caught up in the need to sound good, the need for perfect timings, essential drum fills, guitar solos, bass riffs&nbsp;and what nots. Yes, it is important to sound good, but in our search for excellence, have we ever wondered what we're doing it for? Is it to satisfy the demands of the perfectionist that lie within us as artistes, or for His glory alone? <br /><br />Having been asked to play for&nbsp;z a few months back when their 'jamming' thing was still going on, I was really faced with this dilemma. Every practice incoporated both the spiritual aspects that we needed as well as the strive for perfection. And somehow the latter overode the former. Sigh. And even as I watch the new group play on fridays, I really wonder why they do it. Is it due to the fact that they just want to serve in a ministry (cause it's impt to) or cause they want to do it for Him? My little boy is highly adventurous and always tries to do solos (i might have to admit he might be even better than me), but he is starting to get caught up in that web. What is it all worth for then? All for nothing? <br /><br />Been listening to many of the Hillsong United songs, and the build-ups are so amazing that it makes goose pimples appear. That is what I call, good music. But, good music, without a heart for God, is nothing. They have both! And should we not strive to achieve that? The current parctices for the 27th have been questioned by GY. I hope there will be a balance.</p><p><span style=""font-size: smaller""><em>Why have they not looked for me for Sunday services? ):</em></span><br /><br />-<br /><br />Maybe we're destined for greater things that this.<br />Maybe there's nothing we should be ashamed of.<br />Maybe we were built to be an infrastructure for others.<br />Maybe, we could be happy with support received.<br />Maybe, just maybe..<br /><br /><em>If there was you and me.</em></p>"

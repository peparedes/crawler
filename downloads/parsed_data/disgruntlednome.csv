Long time no see and all that. Pip pip.

I just got back from the dance, and I'm in a writing mood. So here I go:

It was pretty fun. I danced with Sarah. That was fun. I wish I'd danced more. Oh well. The salad had rasberries in it. It reminded me of when my guinea pig had babies. We'd been feeding the two guinea pigs (both of them female) various treats, including rasberries. My brother walked by the cage, saw a splattering of red near their shoe-box home, and said, ""Hey Kevin, have you been feeding them rasberries?"" We turned the box over to find a heaping mass of bloody guinea pig. At first, I thought that one guinea pig had killed the other (they had been fighting), but then the mass split apart into two little babies. We ended up naming them Chewy and Squiggles. Amy (Amazon Guinea Pig Warrior), Abby (Abominable Guinea Snowpig), Chewy, and Squiggles are all buried in the backyard now.

My teeth sort of hurt. I've a wisdom tooth growing in, and I should probably have it removed. The dentists keeps calling, but I suppose I figure that if I don't acknowledge the tooth, it'll go away or something. Oh well.

I've been thinking about deja vu lately. Have you ever gotten the sense not that you're having deja vu, but instead that you're experiencing a situation that you're going to have deja vu about later? That happened to me in Photo once.

Crazy, ne?

Tuesday's going to be senior ditch day. I'm of two minds on the matter. On one hand, it's the ""official"" senior ditch day, and Matt and all them are going to the beach. On the other hand, I've never missed a day of high school, except for field trips and such. On the first hand, it would be fun to miss a day of school. On the other hand, I've got so much school work to finish in these last seven days (creepy) of school that I don't think I can afford to miss a day.

But I think I'll ditch.

I just don't know what to do.

Any ideas, folks?




I picked up some comics today at Blue Moon Comics. Ultimate Spider-Man, H.E.R.O., 1602, Ultimates, and the fourth volume of Bone. All were great comics. Ultimate Spider-Man beat the crud out of Doc Ock, then returned home to find that Gwen Stacy had discovered his secret. A caveman and a criminal gained superpowers in H.E.R.O. In 1602, Captain America traveled through time to tell a harrowing tale about the future of superhero-kind. Future Spiderman was fat and balding, and in futuristic handcuffs. It was kind of depressing, but at the same time pretty cool. In Ultimates, Hulk laid waste to a bunch of aliens. Even ate one. Yummy. I enjoyed them all.

Bone has to be my new favorite comic. It's written (and illustrated, I think) by Jeff Smith, who I think is a genius at mixing light-hearted comedy with a deep (and dark!) plot. His timing is amazing.


My nerdy friends and I couldn't play D&D today because of prom. Oh well, there's always next week. And summer! Although we'll probably have to find a new day to play on.


During Disney Land, Drew expressed interest in inviting me along for camping trips over the summer. I hope I can go camping with them. That'd be fun. I still have the film of Alec, Matt and me camping over Junior year's Easter Break. Fun stuff. I carved a die out of wood, in order to play this board game I brought along. We finished the die, but never played the game. Such is life, ne?


I believe Abby gets back from New York tonight. But then again, I could be crazy.


I've been having crazy dreams lately. And ideas for stories. Dreams first, though.


The first one was set in Times Square in New York. The presidential elections were going on, and George Bush was running against a famous celebrity (not Arnold). The elections were almost over, and it looked like the celebrity was winning. He was standing on top of this stage, grinning over his podium at all the crowds. Flanking Times Square were two gargantuan, building-size TVs, showing live broadcasts of the big election party. However, the tables turned and Bush won the election. He climbed onto the stage and, with a wide-set grin, pushed the celebrity off. Then the aliens attacked. Seriously. Both alien ships were targeting the giant TVs, so everyone in times square was trapped, just waiting for the explosions of the television sets to engulf them. Weird dream, eh?

The other dream took place in Hawaii. I was hiking around the foresty hills when I discovered this glowing green rock. Kind of like krypotite. Suddenly, I tripped, and basically was split in half by this big, sharp rock. Fortunately, with the green rock in hand I was able to heal back together instantly. I knew I had some pretty powerful stuff in my hand. Unfortunately, so did the government, and they sent their secret agency, led by Mr. Rilla, to hunt me down. They chased me all over the Hawaii airport, until finally I turned and started beating on Mr. Rilla. I was doing pretty well until he mutated into this big stretchy monster thing, and started choking me. Then I woke up.



Okay, now the story idea.


The main character would be this middle-school kid who lives in this tiny town called Four Corners. Basically, it would be summer time, and the kid would keep slipping into this fantasy world of his which sort of mirrored the town, only fantasized. The downtown district would be a quiet village in his head. The overpass over the highway would be a bridge over a river. The factories where everyone works would be big ol' volcanoes where orcs and goblins toil away. The story would center around him dealing with some tragic stuff, and being forced to mature out of this fantasy world he keeps slipping into.

I like the idea.




Hm... anything else?


School's almost over. I'm excited. I'll miss folks, but I think I'm ready for some change. I wonder if I'm going to be seen differently in college. I remember my friend Loren Womack took moving to a new town as a chance to run an experiment on first impressions- he created a whole new persona, and made a ton of friends. I wonder what he's up to now."

"event","And I had a rather strange dream last night. Really strange dream. Here we go:

The dream began (I think) as I was walking down a path towards a small town by the side of a river. I was returning to this town. Now I'm not sure if I've dreamed about this town before, or if I made it up in my sleep last night, but I had a history with this town. A long time before, I had lived here, but in different forms. At first, I was a human, but then I (somehow) turned into a badger, and then a polar bear. But as the badger I had made friends with some children, and as a polar bear I had taken care of a cub.

Let me remind you now that this was a weird dream.

I had left the town after my polar bear days (which I wished to return to) for some sad reason- I remember being very emotional on top of that bridge, and throwing something into the water.

So as I walked along this path, I neared the bridge, and took some time to dive beneath the water and find this object again.

And then I was a bear.

I was a brown bear, with really beautiful golden-brown fur. So I entered town as the brown bear, and met up with all the other brown bears. There was a large community of polar bears here, and the brown bears were more of a minority, and thought down upon by the polar bears. One of my fellow brown bears used to be a high-school football player, but was turned into a brown bear by some sort of curse involving the football coach.

So as a brown bear, I was hearded by this giant polar bear through this narrow path lined with fences. And beyond the fences were tons of polar bears, just watching us. I eventually made my way to this island, about 8 feet across, which floated on a small pool of water. It had a palm tree on it.

On this island, I met up with the football coach, who was also the manager of us bears. And then Tara, the kindergarten-age girl from next door, ran up in her swim suit and jumped onto the island.

So then the coach, the former-football-player-now-turned-bear, and I (as a brown bear), along with a few other brown bears made our way through this wooden fence onto vast green rolling hills. The coach explained our plan for the day- apprently we were like cattle, in that we kept the grass short by munching on it. The former-football-player had to go munch on some grass near this old lady's house, where it was getting too long.

As I wandered over these hills, I thought about what form I would choose if I could have one last chance. And I thought about the friends I had made as a badger, and the cub I had taken care of as a polar bear, and this friendly former-football-player I now knew as a brown bear. And I decided I'd prefer to be human, so that I could still be friends with all of the above.

And that was the end of the dream.



After waking up, I couldn't get back to sleep."

"event","So, last night, I have this dream.

So it starts, as usual, at school. I'm taking an Algebra 2 test which I don't finish in the normal class period. I'm the only one who didn't finish, so I'm the only one who must stay after to take it. Now, unfortunately, the dream fast-forwards to afterschool, when I suddenly realize I literally took the test instead of turning it in.

So then my friend Matt is driving his mom and I. We see a pack of animals (I forget what kind, but I think they were rabbits) charge by, then suddenly fall down dead. Then a flock (in V formation) of Vultures (hey, V for Vultures) flew by, completely ignoring the hopeless hoppers (tee hee).

So, of course, Matt, Matt's mom, and I decide to follow this V of Vultures to see just where they're going, and why it's more important than a meal of braindead bunny (ha ha). These vultures lead us to the middle of the desert. We lose the car, 'cause, y'know, cars have trouble driving on sand. The vultures finally land on the skeletons of four (or was it five) dead riders and their horses. Skeletons, really.

So, as we puzzle why the vultures landed on these sun-dried skeletons (wee hoo), the horses suddenly stood up. But they were skeletons. Then they started trotting awy.

So, I think at this point, my dream was just plum too weird, and it stopped.

...

Stop looking at me like that!"

Once, I left the window to my room open. I closed it at night, but I had let a fly in. This was a big fly. It was a survivor. That was one exciting night. I had grabbed my weapon of choice (a flyswatter, believe it or not), and began the hunt. Because of the darkening night, I was forced to use senses other than sight. The flie's buzzing wings echoed off my eardrums. I swung!    and missed. The fly had vanished. I concentrated, scanning over the walls of my room, studying every detail. Where was the fly? In the shadows? In the eye of that drawing? No, wait! The ceiling! Of course! SWAP!      and I missed.    again.    well, nuts.

The cat and mouse game (or Kevin and Fly game... hm, maybe not... that is kind of a lame joke. So, ignore these parenthesis) continued 'til the early morn. Well, only for an hour or so. Yup. But we did pull off a truce. The fly stopped buzzing, and I slept.

All in all, it was a good night.

Ah-yup."

In it, I was riding a mule around Novato.

A dead mule, to boot.

Now the dream wasn't focusing on the horror of sitting atop a rotting equine cadaver, instead its theme was the absurb hilarity of trotting about on a lifeless animal.

As I rode around Novato, friends and peers waved and said greetings like ""Hey, Kevin!"" ""Nice mule, Kevin!"" ""Ha! A dead mule! Good one, Kevin!""

""Morgal Wooplah?"" curiositized the child.

""The most wigworn man in all of Whorlington,"" the man extatically pronounciated.

""What speak you, old man?"" the child confusicated.

""Back in my day, the high noon nickatick would come hobwobbling 'round and nektie a child every Satlatter night."" boasted the man.

""Your words enter through one ear, yet are lost and befuddled in the labrynths of logic that protect the mind,"" contorificatized the child.

""But Jimmy an' me,"" the man recalled, ""we knew how to nick-nack that pattywack of a polygamy. It was a hottorific sumnur eveling, and we were partificating in a jubulicious game of Ronford, oh yes we was.""

""And...?"" questopholated the child, ""Is there a point, old man?""

The man stood for a moment, caught mortified on his high horse. A moment for regaining composition later, the man spoke two words, words that pierced the air like arrows sprung fresh from archer's bow.

""Morgal Wooplah,"" spoke the old man.

""Morgal Wooplah?"" curiositized the child.

"event","My button popped off and rolled away
To where it went I cannot say
I wish, I hope, I even pray
That it may roll back some day.
(For if I stop to look around
I must bend over and my pants fall down!)"

"event","For dinner my father made Lambloaf and rice.

While the word Lambloaf does have the effect of rolling off one's tongue, the actual food amplifies the rolling by actually leaping off the diner's palate.

Let me further extrapolate by describing this Lambloaf.

Lambloaf (and I refer to it in name, for I do believe it would prefer, if conscious, to be known simply as Lambloaf) shares the appearance of a bruised brick. It outer translucent skin barely covers spongy entrails that, when pressed, release a nauseatingliquid that pools in the center of the plate to form a vile sea of Lambloaf-stenched ichor.

My dad suggested I just eat it.

I replied that Lambloaf wasn't something to be eaten, but something to be acquainted with.

But, being an adventurous sot, I bisected the Lambloaf, performed a vivisection with the skills of a practiced surgeon, and extracted all forms of onions and one tumor of a corn kernel. Using my fork (for I would be cautious to have skin contact with Lambloaf) I hesitantly placed the piece of loafed lamb in my mouth, chewed, and swallowed.

And then swallowed again.

For Lambloaf is one of those foods that forces the diner to swallow twice, once for the meal itself, and yet again for the aftertaste.

I do believe I crunched upon something in my chewing, however the thought soon escaped my mind as my lips puckered and my eyes watered.

The Lambloaf clogged halfway down my throat and I was forced to send a strike team of saliva to dislodge the piece of mixed meat.

I smiled weakly at my father, expressed my thanks for dinner while wiping the water from my eyes, and moved onto the rice.

Which wasn't half-bad."

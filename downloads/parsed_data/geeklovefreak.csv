"event","oh my god last night was so funny. First I watched the season finale of 24 and I was talking to claudi. But claudi doesn't want to be spoiled, so I wasn't allowed to tell her anything..I did anyway LOL. At least a bit. LOL
Later on meg signed on and I could persuade her and claudi to make a skype conference. At first they weren't saying anything and I practically had to drag the words out of their mouths LOL. But then we had a lot of fun!! It was getting later and later and me and claudi became very tired. But the more tired we were, the more fun we had. One time I told meg about some tyrolese tradition and she was laughing manically. Me and claudi were wondering what's going on, we thought i had sad something really stupid LOL
As it turned it wasn't my fault, meg just found it incredibly funny.
Around 4am claudi and meg started having lots of fun, finally claudi participated in the convo!!! Claudi was also breathing very loud the whole time which caused meg and me to laugh a lot (that sentence sounds weird!!)
Later meg started talking british and i was making funny noises, so meg started with ""Mr. Bird"". We laughed a lot. Then we were talking about tee and somehow we were talking about cow eyeballs in our tell LMAO.
At around 5am claudi left us and dragon86 joined us. At 6am it was too much for me too and I finally went to bed, only to get woken up six hours later by my mom.
What a night!!!"

"event","Two entries in one day!!! Maybe I should go to the doctor and let him check me out LOL

so I decided that ljing isn't that hard so I'm going to write in here more often.

We got our school report today and I still can't believe it but I got an A in cooking class. I think my teacher is on drugs. She always pours wine into our soup, maybe that's it LOL.
I got a D in business accounting but who cares? That subject is more boring than spending a whole week in a cellar without a pc!! Okay maybe not, I don't wanna try out that theory.
Apropos pc, I'm getting my new computer next week!!! hopefully.

Then I can finally throw house (my current pc) out of the window!! It's been bugging the hell outta me the last few months!!

I think I'm going to read beneath the surface by enchanted april now, since it's gotten quiet (claudi, <lj user=""piecesfalling"">, is unpacking her stuff LOL)and when my pc finishes uploading my 13 GB folder onto the external hard disc I'm gonna play sims, I still have to get House and Cameron together LOL"

"event","Drabble I just had to write...


When did it start? More importantly how did it start? It probably started with the very first glares and mock hatred, the need to hate, to feel. Each hadn't wanted to fade but found themselves doing so anyways both had people expecting them to do the impossible. Fighting, hating, breathing. It was a circle that had never seemed to end for them. He didn't look ALIVE unless he was throwing out an insult, all other times his eyes where glazed and his mind somewhere else, his hair would fall in his face and he wouldn't even notice until HE came along. At that point the raven hair would be brushed impatiently out of the way so he could see his opposition. He never liked to be coddled and he never got it from HIM. He would always get as good as he gave. He would always seem happier. Sounds crazy but he would. It was what we all wanted so we never questioned it, we were selfish about it later but for now we were glad. After a while they both seemed to go dead until one day they actually smiled. What he was smiling about I didn't know later. Our once enemy had come alive yet uttered no insults or fists. He was, well, civilized. Our raven haired friend grew happy and content. I never understood until a battle, nothing unordinary about it at first, until I saw something I would never forget. It was raining, hard. You could barely see your feet in front of you. The rain stung like bees. Clear cleansing water washed the blood soked ground. Bodies of people who were children just a year ago, who had stayed up late with you in detention making faces behind the care takers back. Laughing, joking turned to screaming, moaning, dying. Always death. They had met, in the middle of the body strewn battlefield. In the middle of the death and caous, they met for a final bitter sweet moment. I couldn't hear what was going on so I moved closer. He was flinging his arms wildly, demandingly. He grabbed at his once opposition's bloody rain soked robes. His enemy, no, he was never an enemy to him. I don't know what he was but he wasn't an enemy. As the raven haired boy shook his head furiously before buring it in the crook of the other's neck. Slowly he stroked my friend's hair, his owned lay in light, wet tangles down his face. He seperated himself from his savior. What I saw next shook me to the core. He knelt. He knelt, as if he was awaiting death. His head tilted back, eyes pleading, arms dangling at his sides. When my friend shook his head again in despair his counter part glared at him. HE waited. If it had been any other opposition my friend would have cursed him without a prayer, he had already done it so many times before. In what I can only imagine as complete and utter despair my unfailing friend of seven years drew his wand and cast the only death curse in excistence. At his feet his savior fell, utterly lifeless, to the ground. His blonde hair was being dyed swirled with the mud, blood, and water. It was the only time he has and ever will leave a battle, he picked up the blonde as if he weighed no more than a child but was the exact lean, muscled structure. He left carrying him to a peaceful place in the middle of nowhere, the place he had already picked to have himself layed. He finished his job, won the war for us, and then with a smile that didn't reach his eyes he said good bye. We never found a body but found a note and his wand telling us not to cry for him. It was out in the middle of nowhere, a long branched willow gaurded the spot. I know he died there and I know the blonde took him safely home. I know they are together without any restictions, they are finally together.               One shot drabble I had to put down=)


Death is thought to be the gate to hell;
but we are inside on the way out,
not outside on the way in.

"event","Argh! This stupid thing has deleted 3 ******* times! Its got me pissed of, the only thing is i can't stay pod for very long. See i""ve already calmed down! Anyways today has either been really bad or really good, its a toss up. Currently i'm ignoring my mother who won't leave me the **** alone. Ok see good vibes... right...

Anyhoo i think i scare people and no one gives a damn about this corner of lj. God i like to get myself depressed, its what im good at. I actually have had time to get bored, amazing considering how much stuff i have going on. anyhoo this is the production of my boredom. 

Still is something that evades my every thought and feel
Suprise is something that every demon weilds

To let down my gaurd is gasdly
But keeping up my walls is taskly

I grow tired being surronded by fire
I wish for the supreme day and inevitable hour.


        As he stared at me with empty eyes, blood running down his blade, I realised more than anything I wished to be just like him. Being at the young age of 10 I didn't realise what a fate like that meant, to be forever alone with only the friend of death.

        Staring down at the bloodied bodies of my parents i asked,""Can I come with you?""

        ""No,"" was his reply as he wiped off hius blade. The color only smeared the blade and stained the pure white cloth. Wincing, he shoved the cloth back in his pocket. ""I can't be held back by a child who doesn't know how to fight.""

        ""I can learn,"" I said feircely.
 
        ""Where?"" he asked sliding the sword easily back into it's worn scabbered.



Where thats as far as I've gotten. If you have ANY ideas PLEASE share cause i have nowhere to go with this so i need ideas. Well i know what happened there but no fillers before thats explained so HHHHHHHEEEEEELLLLPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!   PPPPPPPPPLLLLLLEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!   (HELP, PLEASE)"

All of them that could come brought their horses and we rode and played are... messed around. lifes frustrating i can't stay mad, excited, or happy for very long and it gets depressing; but i don't stay depressed for very long    argh     its like bloody mode swings... however if i am hyper i tend to stay hyper as long as i have a steady supply of sugar. huuuuhhh  im kinda bored   

have you ever noticed that people will readily talk about people behind their back?  its not always bad but it gets fucking annoying like my mother who is looking over my goddamn back  ahem...    moving on   *depression mode*     can't draw can't do a goddamn thing   except annoy people, i wonder how many people actually like me for me.  Tons of people will be nice to other just not to offend them   makes me bloody paranoid  *big sigh*   o well like saiyuki said i don't follow any ones rules but my own.  don't like it to fucking bad!  course nobody notices it but o well. maybe i need to hold my tongue more. closed mouth doesn't have a boot in it.  how do you know how to act around someone you ""respect"" not bloody like but respect. it seems like they are really nice and really close freinds then they give you the cold shoulder    god its fucking confusing.  ok i'm done. going to sleep"

"event","Oops  hehehe  I actdentily almost posted without an entry   hehehe  School has started and it sucks. Honestly Chem homework on the first day ?_? Lucky I didn't have chem homework this weekend, my class already figured out that if you can keep him talking he will go of on a tangent. Quite funny actually. I also can't say his name. My geography teacher has freaky smile its toadish. My spanish teacher is a new one and insists on not talking any louder than a whisper. If she had my spanish class last year she would have run out screaming. Unfortunatly this class is filled with preps  *ARGH*  The only class that is really the same is orchestra. I get to feel all important cause only freshman and sophmores are in this class. The higher class is chamber, to get in it you have to take a playing test. I choose to stay behind and not even take my test.    Mothers are very annoying, I know I have to wear my retainer but she goes over the top with it.    Ok back to school :p Right after orch I have lunch, luckily one of my friends is in it so I'm not alone. Best of all she is a horsie freind and has a horse named Zips. The thing that totally sucks is that after an atack in our school last year we are not allowed to carry around book bags! Of course they allow purses which I think is totally dumb and I don't even wear one! After lunch is geometry which homework is assigned  EVERY BLOODY DAY!  After geometry is world history which is TOTALLY AWESOME! Minimal homework and a very cool teacher. After that is english, a total free class. The teacher is a tade bit out of it. You wonder if all her screws are in her head.  Last but not least is chem- ah the talk and don't get anything done.  Honestly if you keep him talking you never get any homework- but you also don't learn anything. He can be funny cause he just doesn't get it. 
            This Saturday is a horse show but I am only going for gaming. Cacy and I shouldn't dop to bad. Well we hope. Hopefully I can turn a profit cause good knows I could use it. I think I will also run a 3-D but maybe not cause the compitions a whole lot harder. Cross your fingers for us. 
           Drivers ed aint to bad I think I'm just finished my 3rd driver... parallel parking, actually it isn't that hard. The hardest part is when the instructors contridict themselves. God that can get frustrating! 
          I burned myself with fire. I was messing around with my moms candles and burning bits of paper. Needless to say I burned my hand.     Oh pity me!
         At the moment I can't think of anything else to type so ttfn!"

"event","I had a very good day and cause no one tends to care here, i will write it in here. How many of you actually realize that made no sense? Oh well, anyways I got up at 6 was working at a barn down the street for the whole morning. I help the barn down the street from me for pure fun. Weird huh? Anyhoo the person i always see is Tracy(who is 32 but acts like she is 16) she is also a hp fan and we tend to get carried away. We both read fanfics and have both stayed up all hours of the night for the blank book or movie. I say blank instead of cusing, get used to it! Anyhoo She is awesome! I was working over there and the best part is her bosses are gone for 2 whole weeks! Me and her boss have both been trying to get her to ride more cause she used to ride when she was my age and is very good. She also gave me a show halter with real silver and everything! For several weeks i've been haggling money to by a halter bag to keep it nice. Well a week ago I did chores for them when they were gone to take their horses to the trainers and today I received a $25 gift certificate for Tonys Saddle Shop. I CAN FINALLY GET MY HALTER BAG! ok im calm im breathing, I also went trail riding yesterday with most of my horse buddies and we had a blast! We galloped over 1/2 of the trails and had lunch there and totally joked around. I hope to do it again wednesday but i won't have a way over there so we will see. Now i have to go about the task of telling everybody. *big sigh* Ok write you all later.


P.S.- I hate school and in less than 3 weeks we start school! Summer just started! How un-bloody-fair!"

"event","Forgive me but I come up with unusual things to post as subjects and until i get really witty i will be weird. I got my jeffers equine today and i really want a bridle bag but as always i don't have enough money. poor poor pitiful me. As soon as i turn 16 though i WILL be getting a job. ok maybe as soon as i become non lazy i will get a job. i have to worm my horses today, not fun but not awful either. At least my horses are trained to do what they are supposed to (most of the time). I know one mare who will not load she had to get stitcts cause of it. No offense to the leaser cause she is really nice and would work with the horse but the owner is a nancy. In my opinion the horse shouldn't be allowed to eat or drink anything until she gets in the trailer but always have the ability to get in the trailer avaliable. When she gets hungry enough she will get in the trailer. It sounds cruel but this mare is hells girl dog. She is a sase and has never been made to do anything.Wow i am really spewing off bad vibes. I really should go out and ride cause i have a show in a week and a 1/2 But i am being lazy. Big sigh, i will not write anything until i come up with something really witty or untili get extremely bored. Most likely the latter. haha funny word latter sounds like ladder. tata for now."

"event","HAHAHAHAHHAH! I'm taking drivers training and it is boring!! I AM LAZY YET REALLY HYPER WHICH IS A STUPID COMBO. Oopps I had my caps on and I didn't even realize it. go figure. What is with that phrase anyway? Who ever though of that must be a genius considering it actually sticks. Like honey but honey really isn't that sticky it is more oozy. It is sticky when it dries though. I have gotten gum in my hair overnight, cause I'm not allowed to have it with braces even though i get the bloody things off this August, so i chew it at night and i go to sleep with it in my mouth and i wake up with it in my hair. How does it get from my mouth to my hair anyways? WARNING CHANGE OF TOPIC! (That time i meant to have my caps on.)When I answer the telly i say yellow instead of hello just cause i think it sounds funnier. Anyhoo i am having a major sugar rush which is kinda ODD CAUSE (oops caps again)i just had chinese i love chinese. the only problem with it though is that no matter what i cannot seem to hold the bloody chopsticks! Stupid bloody things won't stay in my bloody hand! Oh and if you can't tell i like britash words, especially britash cuss words. I say arse instead of axx just cause i think it sounds funnier. Another thing is how do you spell Britash anyways cause i know that ain't how you say britash, or spell it really. The good news is i am stopping writing, the bad mews is that when i have written i never have anything fantastically interesting to say so it is really just nonsense. however if it floats your boat (or a least takes care of a little leak) have fun! tata!"

I just had my local fair, i actually compete believe it or not and i was in all the horse projects; minis, drafts, and normal. My normal horse is anything but ""normal"" he likes pop, gatorade, and joly ranchers. He is a big baby and will follow you everywhere if you give him just ONE cookie. Im still bored and I have drivers training with Stew. His real name is stuart but we are to call him stew. I think whomever names their kid stuart is totally warped. Then again i have been told im warped. it kind of makes you wonder how reliable your sources are. tata for now."

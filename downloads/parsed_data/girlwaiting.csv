I find it weird that I couldn't remember my LJ name and had to ask Stormy if I was friended on her list when I posted a blog a couple of months ago..

what is wrong with me?
seriously.


I can't remember anything!




today is peaceful.

but I'd really like a dr. pepper right about now, which won't be happening.

"event","I've noticed for a long time ever since Aaron and I stopped cohabiting... that my cat has had some strange habits, and today I was reading somewhere that children tend to have split personalities...the good and the bad complex, when coming from a broken home, which I was thought was weird. part of them wants to be good, and the other part of them will act out doing things out of ordinary, trying to deal with the loss of the other parent...
so the good maisy is normal and sweet purring, and cuddling and very affectionate, and the bad maisy goes around trying to bury something that isn't there constantly..you'd think she'd dug a hole clear to china in our floor..or wall...whatever she tries to bury when in reality there isn't anything too bury...and sometimes she stands on the dresser and it looks like she's treading water on the posters hanging on the wall in front of her...and then she goes around meowing incessantly, like she's in a pot of hot water, is about to melt....and licks her sweet little licks and then bites viciously in the middle of them...
 
its proof positive that she came from a broken home.. poor little kitty."

you held onto my little fingertips so big inside your hands.

and I was afraid to let go.

afraid to let you know that I was scared to let you go...

but I did, because I was stronger than I thought ... 

and braver than I knew.

every little piece of you, slipping through my fingers as I willfully let them go..

to find me....

while I was trying to fix all the lost parts of you....and put the puzzles back together...I lost who I had once become. 

The strong girl with a strong smile and a brave face that was sincere, instead it was replaced with a brave face that I had only put on..for a show....

you are long gone...your problems once again swept under the rug..I am sure of.. but its no longer my carpet to clean...even though you want to make it mine..

and I am free.

I ignore your words...and your thoughts, and your phone calls, and your text messages and the emails you constantly leave me. There is a girl who you promised your heart too...and she is yours and you are hers...

you've lost this one, the one for you, you claim. But how can that be? Because you were not the one for me..

..sadly you learned to take forgranted... ..

and I am proud of the girl I've become without you.



Strong without you

because you never defined me...like I thought you did ...

"event","&nbsp;I don't even know what I am doing freakin awake...
haha..I am so tired, I woke up early this morning after only getting a few hours of sleep..maybe two or three...I am so tired..
I got up out of bed with yesterdays make up, and pjs, and I didn't even brush my hair..come to think of it...sad..I did remember my teeth though :)!
I am usually a 9 hour sleeper...And those of you who knows me, know that I love my sleep and I don't do well if I don't get it..haha:)
its just how I roll ( sorry I had to let the gangsta come out in me.)

I woke up early to go to a bible study w/ my sister in law, her best friend and myself...So it was very worth it. I really needed that time to renew my heart. Its amazing how sometimes God isn't our first though, and he really should be. I am a much yuckier person without God.

I've been really sad and depressed lately, and I just have felt yucky.&nbsp; I just have let so many things build up under this pressure. I had so much to work on and concentrate on, and then I started worrying about other things that have seemed to come up, little issues here and there, and the pressure and the stress of it all just built and built til I was just extremely erratic, and emotional with my feelings..

But don't worry, God is dealing with me. He has been gentle about it too..
I got bit by the religion bug a little bit..I was listening to something my sister said...that Religion makes people sometimes prideful and self righteouess, where as the actual personal and intimate relationship with Christs, brings love for others, mercy and patience for them.
I defintely felt like I had been a little self righteouess and prideful with some things I had said to Nikole.&nbsp; I should have just loved her and prayed for her, and let God deal with her in his own way, but I said some things that were a little prideful and hurtful..and I knew immeadiately after I did that I was sorry and it wasn't the right thing to say, so I quickly apologized and hugged her for a long time.

God loves us just like a father loves his son...No matter what we doe, he is quick to forgive if we only ask....God doesn't keep track of what we do if we believe in him...his love covers all you've done wrong...If it were about what you do..or what you did...then Christ would have died in vain..because if your living by your works..you'd never be good enough..one bad thing that you've done already messed it up for you..
It defniitely is like a parent/child relationship..I mean think about it..When your kid does something worng, you aren't going to make him pay the rest of his life for his bad behavior..you say, you know that was wrong, and you know it..but I love you and because you are sorry for what you've done, and I can see that..I have forgiven you for it..
It that unconditonal love, and the thing is..that because we've given our lives to christ..and we've allowed him into our lives...and if we try to do all the work in and of ourselves only..we will fail...because you love Christ..those things will come naturally, but he has to do the work for you...because otherwise it will not be fruitful...
It is not a burden..its like when you're a kid, and you love your parents so much...that you just want to have that fellowship with them..you want to be like them...
thats how it is with God...when you become his child..you inherit his traits..

I am not saying these things to look&nbsp; ""religious"" or make you feel like I am a ""religious"" person..
what you think of me, does not matter...I just want to be Gods..completely and wholly, and I want to serve him and be at his feet as mary was...my religion isn't what has saved me..it is my perosonal...father daughter relationship with God...

I have been through so many trials lately, and yes I could be bitter and angry at God, but God didn't create these trials, because satan has a hold on so much of this world, and he took hold of this world when the first sin entered the world. God never meant for this world to loose fellowship with him, and he has tried to restore it, but because everyone has a mind of their own, their ways may not be of God.
Being bitter and angry would make me hateful, and why would I be angry at the only one who can give me the strength and endurance to get through, and deliver me from it?
It is a waste of time to feel that way...and it sucks some days, and it hurts like what I feel hell could feel like, but I'd rather endure..to see the sunshine, and the rainbow, which God always created, as a promise that we would always see through the rain, as long as we trusted in him...

Thats what I feel....and I am just so thankful that I've been given the desire to know and study more about God...
I definitely wouldn't be this encouraged if I had just listened to what everyone else had said about God, if I just closed my heart to other options and not studied for myself, and&nbsp;only trusted what leaders and believers said...because even leaders...can lead you in the wrong direction....I am glad I studied for myself, the facts and the evidence, and sought out a personal relationship...
because instead of my religion...and my church standing next to me..I have Jesus...and when I am in front of the Judge...he will say ""she is mine...I know her.. intimately and personally."" and my sins will be wiped away, and I be white as snow, because Jesus died on the cross, and his blood has covered me ...
To focus on the cross where Christ died for our sins...is foolish to those who don't believe..or are perishing ( which means they die in their sin) but to those who believe in Christ..it is the power of God.
thats 1 Corinthians 1:18
I love that verse...it makes me so thankful that Christ died for me....and my sin...personally.....and all of it is wiped clean...

I am going to go to bed now."

Last night I dreamt about Aaron 

and I am so tired of bringing up these newly fresh feelings. Just when I feel like things are moving forward and I can leave all this behind....... 

and then it comes back to haunt me..it leaves this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach, and raises questions of why... 

why is he doing this...for the third time. 

Lord knows I should have learned, but you don't really know someone so well until you spend every waking minute w/ them in your house.. 

and when you live together sometimes it brings up the ugliness that you never witnessed before. 



I know he's not good for me.. 

I know it... 

but it still hurts. 

this letting go.. 

it still hurts. 

but I do not want to jeapordize my future with someone else... 

I just pray God heals me quickly. 

I want to be a wife and a mother...and I don't want to be held back from things that shouldn't affect me..

Something I have to battle with on a daily basis. I am not so flighty...that I could just write off someone that I claimed to have love, and forget about their cares or concerns..and just erase myself from their life. I do not know many people who could do that, and I am not sure what the purpose is for that still today. Its so hard for me to just write someone off.

I learned something from a friend that was&nbsp;close to her that has&nbsp;given&nbsp;me a lot of peace, but its still so difficult to understand and deal with. She was so young and deserved much better....</p><p>I am sad...I know that dying is much harder on the people left behind...than the ones that have to go...but its still not easy, and it still hurts just as much.</p><p>among other things and little upsets...</p><p>my sister had a miscarriage this month, and just some other things were said to me by someone that were uneccesary..it just shows me&nbsp; how the human heart can be so callous and jealous, </p><p>if someone wants to forget someone and write them off, why do they have to contact people who are apart of that persons new life? They write and tell them all the wrongs they've done, and so on and so forth stating that they're a Christian, but the words in the sentence do not show evidence of that...It leads me to believe that their intentions for spreading such horrible untruths are because they are jealous of what that person has found..or that that person has moved on. I cannot judge her human heart, but it makes me sad someone could be so bitter and angry at someone I've found to be so gentle and loving..</p><p>If it were me...atleast If someone had done me so wrong I wouldn't want anything to do with them..and I wouldn't care if they'd moved on...but clearly when jealousy is an issue...you don't think that way..your first thought is to sabatoge what this person has with someone else...and make them look as horrible as they could...and that is not right.. Some of the things I read made me feel so sick that I couldn't think that any proper lady would ever say those things so casually to someone they do not know...it was none of my business and the past is the past. With God anyone can turn over a new leaf...I literally got this email about 10 minutes after I found out about my cousin, it couldn't have come at a worse time....</p><p>plus..why trust the words of someone who you do not know? versus someone you do...I could never do that..you question it of course, but you trust God alone for the answers.</p><p>I felt sick to my stomach about all these things....I have to pray constantly to get any relief from the sadness of them..</p><p>I am glad that Christ is my foundation..I know before I relied too much on the human heart to find my solace, but lately I have found sweet comfort in my Savior...I have my days..ins and outs..where I wonder if I am truely saved...but only because I experience sadness, and gladness, and then sadness, and gladness. I know that its a work in progress, and I can't expect to be the enlightened christian over night, or just change over night... I am still the emotional, human girl I have always claimed to be... and I daily strive for the calmness I see in my brother and his wife..</p><p>But I am glad I have found how meaningful and powerful prayer can be...and I strive to count it all as joy....even though sometimes its really difficult.</p>"

"event","today is harsh. 

I woke up with a horrible dream about Aaron. 

I dreamt that he was really sick, that he'd done drugs and was really messed up and his friends sent for me and said that he needed me to take care of him, and so I went to him and he couldn't remember me, he had forgotten, or he was so messed up that he didn't know.. 

but I reminded him who I was, and told him that I had loved him for so long, and that I always would...and he said he loved me too and he remembered me... 



why do I have to dream such things? 

I tried to call him to get his address since its been a struggle to even attempt to get a hold of him and he just hung up each time he picked up...it hurts so much..how can he say he loves me so much one day, be the one person I trust to take care of my heart, and my best friend and vowing to marry me and always stand beside me .to the next day hanging up on me, wishing he'd never met me, saying he doesn't think I ever loved him, or he me, never taking my calls...and it just hurts..so much.. I wish this pain would go away..for good.. 

I hate this feeling of waking up..and knowing that he won't be beside me in the bed we shared for the year we lived together...Why is it that love hurts so much..I wish I could forget him and about the strong impression he's made upon my heart. 

I'm so concerned that I won't ever get over him. 

He was my first and only...true love..... 

true love.. 

what does that really mean anymore? it is never for certain that the promises someone makes you are solid. They're here today and gone tomorrow..

I've felt a cloud lift. I have been trusting God more and leaning less on someone else to fill that emotional void of pain. which I did a lot of when I was with Aaron. We both weren't having a&nbsp; trusting relationship with God, and that makes it so much harder for a relationship to carry on. We weren't resting in the abundant Christian life that God promises. And I strongly feel that now, I am in that restful place. I don't think I would have done that unless Aaron and I weren't together...I was leaning too much on him emotionally. Which is good when its a healthy amount...but tiring and weary when its not. God should have been the emotional crutch I was leaning on...</p><p>I've always been a Christian, but I didn't really understand the relationship of trusting God. You hear about it, and you know about all the promises God promises to give you, but unless you put that practice into action in your life, you can never understand it and the awesomeness of it and I've felt this whole gray shade of depression just lift. I still miss Aaron, and I still love him, but I don't feel so sad about not being a part of his life, and I trust soley in the fact that God is in control of my future, and that He will provide for me. If my future is with Aaron than so be it, but I've given him up in the fact that I don't contact him by phone. I leave everything in his court. I hope that God does a work in his life, and brings him the desires of his heart.</p><p>I want my life to be in Gods will, and he's given me comfort and peace and He has promised to give me the desires of my heart if I just seek him..</p><p>so I look forward to that reward.</p><p>Right now I am content with my life. I am content with just my relationship with God and nothing else. I only want to do his will..</p><p>I just feel.......refreshed, revived, and completely loved by God..and for now thats all I need.</p><p>I am confused a little bit by dreams I've had. I did dream about Aaron last night, but it was his rejection that really hurt in the dream. It was more severe that it was in our real relationship... I woke up and just imediately prayed for the feeling to go away, and I've had a much better day since. </p><p>but over all God knows my hearts desires, and I'll just keep praying for this comfort and peace that I feel now.</p><p>I am not sure what will happen and sometimes that is a scary and uncertain thing. </p><p>I think my focus should just be on God for now, spending time with my family and friends in his fellowship..and not anything else. ....</p><p>So thats what I will do.</p>"

it is not fair.

through tears there is slow motion

broken glass.

and an ache that doesn't ever stop. 

Tears that fall down tired cheeks and onto lips that pout in sadness

dulll ache inside my stomach, sharp pain inside my heart, that lies on the floor waiting for him..who ever that is...to put it back inside of me.

I cannot count on you, you with your sweet words that once melted my heart.

your lips that spoke good words, and of children that we would have someday. 

Your lips that kissed sweetly and smile that made my heart leap. Your voice that made my heart sing. 

But now you've left a trail of tears and heartache, and pretty words that didn't mean anything. Pretty is as pretty does, and now..clearly your words are not pretty.  

I want you to be free..

I want you to be free. I want me to be free too. 

Free form this hurting heart that you caused.

how can you be free,  I say to you, when love is all you need, 

but love is all that hurts, and love is indeed all you need. Those words were spoken by our favorite song, and you also once believed in them...

and now we've been written out of that song. So tell me...was that song written about  love we cannot understand? A love we cannot comprehend? I once  looked into your eyes, and you gazed back, and you kissed my tears away, and my lips.  Was that not the love they spoke of?

I knew that was love... and now you say..you weren't ever sure if love was what you had for me... how can that be?

"event","so you'll be happy to know that I'm lookin on the bright side of things...


I know tragedy happens.

love hurts..

but its not the end of the world.


I know I have a lot to offer someone...who is willing to not take that forgranted..

or decide they like me one minute and then don't the next.

Aaron is being fickle..
and I would wait around forever, but frankly..after analyzing everything we were made up of.....I dont' know if I want too..He had his chance, and it might be a little too late. I am fiercely loyal to the ones I care for... 
and...
What if God has someone better?
Than I'd be stifling his plan.
I think I am a loveable person. I KNOW I am a loveable person.

I think that someone would be lucky to have me as their life partner..
and I deserve to be lucky to have someone as my life partner...
but I want someone who is going to be a partner...and not someone who is going to make me do all the work...
I think its a partnership that both people have to work towards, and to be quite honest, Aaron was doing nothing...and I was working my lil butt off to please him.
maybe because I didn't feel I was deserving enough to have someone better.

I think God is pleased w/ my conclusion..because he's given me a sense of peace about things..

I just needed o realize that there are more ""fish in the sea"" so to speak..to really undersand my thoughts and feelings better.

People say it, and it doesn't make it any easier, but its true...and it feels a lot better knowing accepting it, than shying away from it..


anyways..enough of my midnight rambling...


stay tuned my little muffins:) haha..
if thats what you are?! anyways thanks for listening to me vent..always

and leaving me a million comments when I'm sad.
I love it..

"event","I've been here not doing much with myself the last week or so,
but I am tired of that.
I decided that I can't control Aaron's feelings (which is obvious)
I talked to him for a couple of minutes today.
He said he wants me in his life, but he's not sure he wants him in my life...just because he doesn't feel like he's worthy of my love...and he doesn't want to continue to confuse me.

I told him I didn't want to end up at my sister at age 24, when she was with her boyfriend for six years and he promised to marry her for years, and it was just a roller coaster of them going back and forward never knowing if they were together, or not together...I don't want that to be me.

She left her boyfriend and then a couple of months later met someone.. (my brother in law, that she's been marrried to for 11 years)

He said it wasn't fair of him to do that to me...
I told him its not too late for him to straighten up and show me that he really does love and want to be with me, but things had to change.

I know I had a lot of emotional issues that I have to work though, and I am continuing to do that.

I am at my brothers right now just taking time to think about things, and where I am in my life. 

My brother said to me that I am a beautiful and sweet person, and I really have a sweet spirit about me.
He said that any guy would be so lucky to be with me, and that I just need to devote my life to God and doing what he wants, because he will give me what I need in my life first and foremost.

I really want to devote my life to God, and put him first, becuase than I think everything else will come into place.
I will pray for a person to come into my life, because God knows everything that I could think or feel..or want...
and maybe that person is Aaron, but God needs to do a lot of work on his heart before I know it's him or not..

what I want in a guy-

  first and foremost, someone who loves God more than any other person in the universe.

someone who trusts God

Someone who I won't have to chase, but will chase me instead.

Someone that reassures me and that I can trust.

SOmeone who will call me first.

Someone who has goals, and will prepare for a future with someone he loves and cares about...
i.e financially stable or atleast on his way.

someone isn't irresponsible.



so maybe this is a lot for me to chew on right now, 
but I can only start w/ the basics of what I want...and not of WHO it includes..

at this point. I just want to be happy...


I just want a happy ending."

I am holding on to a very slim glimmer, sliver, tiny piece of hope.

so I am holding on to that.

I haven't been to work this whole week. I know its silly, and maybe I should have been, but I've felt so...sad
this sense of hopelessness. 

I'm having a hard time not to calling him.
I told him I would give him some space.
a couple of days, although I am not quite sure what that would do..

oh...
my heart..
it stings.
it hurts.
it aches.
it feels nothing...but that one broken part..

numb, but with this stinging pain in my heart that feels like its going to burst.

alone..

even though I know I am not alone, but I feel alone in this pain of not knowing how things will turn out.

I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

I know that the person that I've loved so much..for so long. possibly doesn't want me anymore..

He thinks i'm un happy, because I'm so ""needy"". I don't trust him.

I""ve talked to a number of people and I appreciate all of their comfort.

I feel like dying from this...

why is love such a dirty bastard.

how come everyone always leaves?

 

and random guys...please don't take this break up as an inviation to try and ""get"" with me.

I am not ready for anything like that....I just feel numb...and I am distant..thinking...a million miles away.

I trust a very select few with my feelings, and in most cases you'll know who you are. 

 

I still feel in my heart that its not completely over...

its not a clean break atleast..

so it doesn't heal the same way.

and I still think that after he gets what he needs to figure out figured out..

that he'll realize that its not over...

I'm thinking of like quitting my job, and quitting school, and just going after him...

I went to a comedy club...and it was pretty fun!

I was going to go the gym, but I figured cleaning and moving furniture would account for a good work out....

I cleaned so good today. My mother would be proud.

after a million and one kisses and hugs and tears that fell from eyes,  

I said goodbye, and it wasn't fun..nope, not so much.

I came home to a room mate who is sleepy and not feeling well, and didn't want to keep my company much, so I called my mother who listened and said ""oh honey, you know he'll be back. He's doing this for you and him, and your future together. Just focus on doing what you have to do to get through it."" He had a heart to heart talk with my mother before he left... 

it helped some to hear a voice of reason in my emotional state, and then I read his note that he wrote before he left,

""My love,

I know that most of the time I don't seem like the guy you fell in love with. I have a lot of short comings that I realize I need to work on to not only make you happy but myself as well. The reason I continue to be with you and care about you so deeply is because when I'm with you, I feel that I""m more than what I am. I feel a hope and love that makes my whole life exciting and better than it was without you. I will work on making you the happies you can be because you deserve that. We'll get through this because I already see you as my family and my family is the most important thing next to God.  I love you so much and I just want you to know that.  

        Aaron ""



That is what will help me get through the next six months. I will turn to his notes when I'm sad..and needing his comforting arms..

what will get me through it..is keeping busy and...

God, 

Planning a wedding ceremony, and my friends...

My heart still aches for his face...

"event","Dear Diary.. or something of that sort...?

emo-ness times forever...and a million and one..

Today was exceptionally hard.
we've had our troubled thoughts lately,
and I can't do anything right..say anything right..
and its so hard..

Do you ever wonder where you went..
You were this girl, and you knew her well, and she knew who she was and couldn't be easily swayed, and you make boundaries you never think to cross


and then you do..

And you look in the mirror to seet a stranger..with sad eyes..
and wrinkle frowns..
and the sweet disposition has been ruined by the cruel reality of life..
and the love isn't as sweet as you dreamt
and all the movies made it seem so easy


Aaron said a bunch of things he didn't mean today.
He is trying to quit smoking, and had an evil hang over...I didn't go out w/ him last night because I've been fighting a horrible cold, and I didn't want to be around smoke to make it worse.

He came home drunk, and I hate that. I've never seen him drunk before, maybe a little buzzed, but not outrightedly stumbling around, glazed over eyes drunk...

His mood is sour, and I can only imagine it comes from last night because he's never said things he's said to me today.
We've been bickering all day about stupid little things..but it escalated to a whole other level that just drained me emotionally....

he told me he wanted to move back..
away from me..
and I said..""I want things to work out, but I don't know how to make things work..if you're miserable with me.""

and he said ""and thats why I should go back.""

I felt like someone had knocked the wind out of me..
I just wanted someone to punch me in the face so it wouldn't hurt so bad..

My best friend (who is our room mate as well) is also dealing with a heart ache of her own, she found out someone (whom she's cared for, for the last seven years) doesn't have feelings for her. Though it appeared differently. He spent so much time w/ her, and its only to find out that he cares for her only...and doesn't have feelings for her more than a friend...
it devastated her, and I didn't want to drag her down with my own feelings of discontentment...

so I came into my room after trying to comfort her (while Aaron was still sleeping in the other room) and I cried...I just let it out..sobs..horrid sounds that probably awoke everyone w/i a ten mile raidius.
I couldn't keep it in... I felt devastated, like my world is crashing down around me and I don't know how to stop it.
What can you do?
I bend over backwards for him.
I would do anything for him, and it only comes back to me being unappreciated and doing this or that for him.
I am tired of taking care of him..
when will he start taking care of me?
Maybe I'm just saying all this because I'm emotional. He does for the most part take care of me emotionally, its just today that I am exceptionally sensitive and feeling alone.

Nikole knocked on my door when she heard the sobbing, and asked what was wrong..
basically what came from the conversation was that she thinks I deserve better, and Aaron is a good person, but I am so accomadating to him when he acts unappreciative, and basically I deserve better was the gist of it..but I love him and I don't want to have to get over him for a third time..or be without him..

I know he is a good person, and the struggles are what makes it worth the good time..
He told me that he wasn't going to go anywhere..
he just said things he didn't mean, and that he was frustrated..


I am sensitive..
so sensitive that I get sick of me sometimes

well I have to go.
I just found out my friend went into labor, and I am her birth coach..so I am on my way to the hospital.."

and I can't sleep. I've been contemplating things for some time now. Aaron is fast asleep because he has to work tomorrow, and so do I, but I am not going to work or class...
I'm a little ditcher..
and thats what I am doing..ditching class and work tomorrow.

I just need a day to be lazy, and wear jam-ee's all day. This weekend was a little hectic and busy. We went to dinner w/ my brother today.
Spent a bunch of  $$ at red lobster.
it was good and I came home really stuffed.
today was a very tender and loving day....and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

we had good conversations about the past and things that happened good and bad..just everything.
I walked away from the conversation feeling very complete and content....
I know this boy loves me so much and I am so lucky. I don't think I even know how lucky I am..sometimes I take things forgranted... I think..WAY to often.
I need to keep myself in check, so to speak so I don't lose what I have.

It's kind of like this..
I have a bunch of guy friends that...some that I talk too and are just good friends and thoroughly respect my situation and that I have a very commited relationship, but then there are a handful of boys that I am friends with that tease, or flirt a little, or do this or that...and I kind of ""laugh"" nervously so to speak because I don't know how to react or take them..And they do know where my loyalties lie....
but it leave me with a bad feeling in my stomach. I know that I am not doing anything wrong, but I don't know how to say ""hey you shouldn't do that..because I love Aaron very much."" or if I shouldn't say anything because maybe they don't mean any harm..
but lately this has been occuring quite frequently by a few different guys..and it makes me feel so unbearably upset almost..like sickly...and no ""friendship"" with a guy is more important than my feelings for my love...
I shouldn't care what other people say, but I do care horribely..is the thing..
I care because I hate to hurt peoples feelings...

I guess right now I am really troubled by this...
I'm not sure if I should feel guilty...or if I shouldn't...I think I am not being forward enough.....and maybe I should just say it and get it over with....

but how do you tell someone that you're uncomfortable by their advances?
I've always had a problem speaking my mind...
although I do make it clear that I am in a commited and loving relationship..and happier than I have ever been..


what do you think?"

I was watching an interesting show on TV...well the topic itself was interesting.
It was Oprah..yes I watch Oprah and I quite love her...to tell you the truth of it. I would love to meet her..
but anyways..
The show was about this book called ""the secret"" and this dvd..
and it talked about how you send thoughts consciously and unconsciously....and that what you say determines what you bring into your life.
In order to bring something new into your life, your heart has to be open and grateful for what you do have..
and thats so true..
You have to turn you're thoughts around into positive things and be thankful for you.
You're health, shape or size..no matter what it might be.
Just always find something to be thankful about
You have to be the best example on how to treat yourself.....You have to love yourself like none other...and be the teacher of how you want other people to love you....

anyways..

I fade away in this......

your words would stoke the skin so clean
no one sees the marks made
stolen razorblades

and if letting go is so easy
all you have to do is say the word

why....why can't I put this all behind me
drop the feelings that stay?

I may appear to be a very graceful girl...but in reality. I am the most clumsy girl in all time.
Just ask Aaron..
These things that I do are somewhat amazing, and I am note quite sure how or where I learned this unbelieveable talent to be so clumsy.
I think I inherited it from my father. Atleast I'm sure thats what my mother would tell you and she is not clumsy..She's got this grace about her and it really is...grace...it sticks.
and I just don't.....haha:)
I fall down stairs....sit on chairs that are not there, take drinks of juice and spill
and I just am a very very uncordinated type of girl..

So yesterday I am just kind of surfin the web...doing my thing...

and I stand up to go into another room come back and my cat is sitting on my chair..so I shoo her off, and didn't realize as she was jump off she bumped the chair, she jumped hard enough to make the chair fall over.
and being me..I didn't notice
and instead of sitting down and just falling on the floor..I sat on the legs of the chair and there was a bar right near the bottom of the legs...slammed my back on the bar which made me twist in a funny way, jabbed my ribs w/ the legs of the chair and also then scraped my hiney on the legs of the chair...not to give you a visual, but now I have really bruised ribs, my back is in all sorts of pain. I can't twist or turn a certain way...and I have to sit down slowly, and two really really HUGE painful scrapes on my bum:(

"event","So here is a tenative thought..I have been thinking of seriously commiting myself to another job..
Within the company that I work. I think I am tried of being a financial advisor. I've done my time..
Two years is too long to stow somebody away somewhere giving financial advice, and sometimes friendly advice too...I am tired of having to be agressive..when I am thoroughly not aggressive when it it comes to most things.
I am a softee, and those who know me...know that about me.
The straw that broke the camels back, so to speak...was when my boss got all up in my junk about taking the day off...

The last month or so I have been contemplating a Loan doc position, where I just worth with internal customers..which means people who work for the company, other employee's. That's who I would be dealing with..I have a friend who had transfered there and she really liked it. 

And as some of you know, I am a Christian, so when I am contemplating such things..in order to make the right choices I often pray about it.

so I did pray, and I asked God spefically for guidance on what I should do about my job.
And last friday I got a customer who also happened to be an employee of my company, and I was helping him with his accounts. He had said to me that he was about ready to retire in the coming week. He had worked for 30 years for the company.
He then out of the blue said, Can I give you some advice, and so I said..of course..
and he proceeded to tell me that once you've been in your position for two years, it is good to look at other opportunities to promote growth and get experience..

and I thought how fitting because I had just been praying about where I wanted to take my career, and I just wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I was a little scared of the changes that I would face if I did choose to go somewhere else, and although not a valid reason for not making a choice...it still held me back.
So then I thought..Okay God ..if this message was a word of wisdom from you..please confirm this so I know.

so that was last week
and today I get to work, and  one of the guys who used to work in my deptartment was at my desk, and he said ""hey Amber..I just wanted to tell you about this position in Loan Docs that I think you would be GREAT for! The application process is only open for today, and I really think you should apply.""

There was my confirmation. I was trusting God to give it to me..and he did!
He did that for me! And I felt special. I love how I can ask God for specific things..and I get the answer I am looking for.
so now it is in his hands..
and I hope that he puts favor in my current bosses heart for me..
because I don't want her to be angry or upset.
I haven't gotten the job...
but I am just praying....because I think it is the new thing I need...to not be so stressed....


I applied to the job of course. In case you were wondering?
haha:)
what a cliff hanger right?"

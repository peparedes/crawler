<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Saturday:&nbsp; </span>It was a nice
day. I think the best part is that I didnt work :-). I heard it was a
madhouse there with lots of people argueing with the front desk and
bitching. Im so mad I wasn't there &gt;_&gt;. Then I went to Sarah's
lakehouse thingy. I think the highlight was the food. I had 2-3 hotdogs
and some cooler ranch chips. Mmmmm. Oh Yeah. people where there that I
knew, that was coo. We went swimming. I nearly got killed by chicks
that wanted me and I then I got about 1000 mosquitoes all over my legs.
but the highlight was the undercooked hotdogs lol :-) :-p <br>
<br>
&lt;_&lt; and I wonder why people stop talking to me....<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sunday: </span>I had to work today,
3-11pm. It was very boring but it was the first sunday that went by
pretty fast. SWEET. my barber likes to drop by now since I told him I
would let him slide and go swimming for free (you usually need a 400
buck membership or something to swim and use the fitness center for a
year) but he told me I get free haircuts now so woo.. I like hooking
people up now. so if you want to swim for free, ill allow it if you
give me food or money...<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">School Update: </span>My Official
Stance is that I am having a semester off from WNEC to basically bring
up grades, etc. I will be in the area for one semester and taking
courses so I dont just sit around and do nothing.. wouldnt that be a
shame. but it gives me plenty of time to work and make more money and
hang out with all the plainfield people I know.. the 3 of em. I still
plan to visit whenever I am just sitting around and I'm bored. One
Semester will go fast :-)<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">More Boring News: </span>I was bored
last night (Saturday) since I have no life and no bottle of vodka with
me. I decided to make the most badass collection CD eVAR!!. It is my
""ULTIMATE weezer 4 disc collection"". I just wanted to post that because
I can. and I enjoy talking about the same topics over and over again
and leaving out more interesting details of mah life...<br>
<br>
here is the cover I made for it:<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://img303.imageshack.us/img303/1240/original4oy.jpg""><br>
<br>
I think it is badass. I love ruining historical pieces of art for this
type of thing. The original image is ""Katsushika Hokusai's - Great
Waves""... hey I am taking an Art History II summer course.. I know this
shit.. bittttttch. I plan to make collection CD's for every band I
like.. :-) It's something to do.. SO SHUT IT<br>
<br>
here is the Green Day one I made too:<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://img349.imageshack.us/img349/982/reflection4dv.jpg""><br>
<br>
Okay. I'm tired and realized this whole post was just a giant away message. its 4:18 am so fuck off. bye :-) love you all!<br>

"event","AND I DONT WANNA BE AN OLD MAN ANYMORE<br>
BEEN A YEAR OR 2 SINCE I WAS OUT ON THE FLOOR<br>
SHAKING BOOTY, MAKING SWEET LOVE ALL THE NIGHT<br>
ITS TIME I GOT BACK TO THE GOOOOOD LIFE!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Dare Reflection Time: </span>I don't
know what it has been lately, maybe its my ""sexy new haircut"" or
something in the water. but I've been feeling a lot more spunk than
usual :-) . I'm usually very mild mannered *hides giant <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">&lt;</span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">S</span></span><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">&gt;</span></span>
underneath my shirt* but I've been feeling motivated. and I don't know
if alot of you know this but motivated darius is one BAD MOTHA FUCKA
&gt;_&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*motivation probably lasts one day*<br>
<br>

<span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-weight: bold;"">I'll be mobile and causing trouble... HIDE YER DAUGHTERS &lt;_&lt;</span><br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Life Lately: </span>Lets see, As I
said. I got a haircut today. Its about time I was all hippyish! My
barber asked where I worked and actually wanted to stop by and swim..
Usually you are only allowed if you got a membership, but If I'm on
duty and you want to swim. Just drop by and I'll let you slide..... in
exchange for sexual favors. So stop by sometime! but If you cause
trouble. I get to call the cops. Work wasn't too bad today. I really
wish we could swear or say sarcastic smartass remarks to people who
complain and act retarded. <br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">Complaining Guest:</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);""> Oh Yeah? Well whats stopping me from getting my bags and going to Mohegan Sun and getting a room there?? </span><br style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">My Brain: </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">a.) go right the fuck ahead. b.) I doubt you would get a room when they are sold out, you douche </span><br style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">My Mouth:</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">
oh.. no.. please don't go, im sorry for the inconvinence... *forcably
lowers rate 10 dollars* thank you for dealing with this, sir.<br>
<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Other than that, I have been pretty
good. I am enjoying this summer and really am thinking about planning
some things and just overall changing my very relaxed and chill
personality. I think Ill take some initiative and start actually caring
about things most people do.. I think I'm growing up and maturing a
bit... or maybe I just care a little bit more :-p<br>
<br>
But I think I am going to either go to sleep so I can get some sleep so
I might be able to see some friends tomorrow and maybe go out this
week. I dont really work monday - thursday and I think I'll get a
little bit more time to do something. maybe 6 flags or whatever. well
catch ya later..... <br>
<br>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Work: </span>Wow, Its been a hell the
last few days haha. I had to take over Kim's day shift because she went
on vacation so I ended up working 10 days in a row and having my
schedule all over the place. It was certainly a bitch but its finally
done so Im glad to hear that.. The housekeeping area was crazy also
with tons of shit going on.. glad im not in there! but its finally
taken care of and calm in there also. I can't wait to get that fatty
check of mine :-) boo ya baby!<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other Life Details:&nbsp; </span>hmmm,
I been enjoying myself a bit and hanging out with friends when I can
and such. I also FINALLY got my electric guitar a week or so ago and I
love playing it :-) hehe. Rock that bitch baby. I think I wanna find
time to either hang out or do something cool this week so I'll have to
figure it out from there. I would put more thats been going on but I
just felt the need to update a small bit since I havent in foreva! well
peace suckaz<br>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">My Life In General:&nbsp; </span>Hmm,
I have been busy pretty much doing very minimal social activities. Went
to NY for a weekend for a graduation... I hung out with Jessica and
Jamie once a week or so ago before that... if you count that.. We drove
around and shopped and they wanted me to bring my guitar so I can
like.. play songs to them randomly as I walked around (...so they would
get turned on).. bitches love the guitar.. :-) . Other than that, I
have just been chilling around the house and town whenever I get a
chance. My life is very calm<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Summer Bummer: </span>I'm taking one
or two summer courses (Online classes are easy). So that should keep me
busy by asking me to do about 2-3 useless assignments a week
(&gt;_&gt;). Its not that bad and one of the classes requires me to
creatively write here and there. I'm sort of getting good at creating
poems/lyrics. but I'll get better at it as time continues. I think I
would probably do this even if i wasnt take this course. Maybe I'll
post some of my lyrics or songs (with guitar) in the future here for
you all to ""enjoy"". (lol)<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Online Companies:&nbsp; </span>I
HAVEN'T gotten my super cool electric guitar pack yet.. Apparently its
takes forever when you get free shipping.. They said on the thing.. It
would take 7 days to get here.. okay thats cool... *after 7 days*.. I
get an email from fedex.. saying the estimated date it would get here
in another 6 days (I.E. today)... thats fine i guess... *comes today*.
I learn that that was the time it would get to FEDEX... it will come in
another 7 days.. Im pissed... If it doesnt come then.. Im going to
kidnap their children.... &gt;:o&nbsp; &gt;:o<br>

was the fourth of July Weekend. So naturally It was very busy (I sold
us out though, woo woo). It was mostly calm but just progressive. But
naturally that never stays that way on a saturday. Something has to
happen involving intoxicated people.. Apparently we accidently checked
in Heroin Cokeheads. So we had to pay extra watch to make sure nothing
shady happened and all that.. It was very nice to deal with that... <br>

Its the most random adult dry humor ever.. its great.. I got back from
work In a pretty crappy mood but then I put this on and it just made me
laugh sooo much.. Robot Chicken had a bunch of claymation
parodies/skits (with a twist) and other things..and other great shows
such as ATHF, Space Ghost, 12oz mouse, Family Guy, Etc...&nbsp; If I could
define this humor as anything. I would describe it as ""Stoner cartoons
for stoners"". It is just so stupid its awesome. with adult weird humor
on the rise. I can forsee a super awesome solo channel. <br>

<br>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Strongest Freak? lol - </span>The next
thing I changed to was this TLC&nbsp; on the ""Worlds Strongest Boy""... this
kid's life must have sucked... the parents were like ""NO TOYS AND NO
FRIENDS. just make money for me"". This kid just works out and poses for
perverts on the internet... &gt;_&gt;. I mean cmon.. He can do a RVD
split weightlifting (where you do a split on chairs and hold weights)
at just 9 years old.. who the fuck does that at 9... WHAT A FUCKING
FREEK!...<br>

<br>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Green Day Diss - </span>There was this
article where Green Day met their Punk Idol, and he totally dissed them
and said that he didnt know who they were and they were ""not punk""..
now let me tell you.. that has to suck...&nbsp; you can read about it<a href=""http://www.dc101.com/script/headline_newsmanager.php?id=415480&amp;pagecontent=musicnewsrockactive&amp;feed_id=122""> here</a> .<br>

<br>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Friends/Work - </span>I haven't done
much.. I was mostly working, practicing chords, I hung out with some friends during the weekand.. It was pretty enjoyable I look forward to having more opportunities to hang out and see people. Word... now back to:<br>

<br>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Well I'm going to go since I'm
tired and this is just me typing out very random sleepy thoughts..
Yep.. I'm going to sleep then I'm going to wake up and either swim
somewhere or sleep listening to Weezer. Peace out nugs! Darius<br>

<b>Who the Fuck Vacations In Plainfield?</b> - I worked this whole weekend.. it consumed alot of my time and to be honest with you was very boring.. not one day was excessively busy.. so instead I:

1. Watched a shitload of (TBS, TNT, USA) movies.
2. Walked 1000+ laps around the front desk area. 
3. Smiled and pretended I cared about the people checking in. 
4. Checked out alot of MILF's and hotties asses. 8-)
5. Coffee, Coffee, Coffee, Coffee.


I look forward to my day off of (monday, tuesday,weds afternoon, thurs) and saturday which I will be going to a family graduation.... <i>suckah!!</i> 


<b>Hot Chick of The Day</b> - Maria Sharapova.. she can play with my Balls and Racket anyday.. 8-) MATCH SET POINT!!!!!!!


<b>Online Goodies</b> - With a part of my check I just recieved I plan to get a few things I need via the Wild Wonderful Web.. A decent kit off the net that contains an <b>(Electric Guitar, 15 Watt Guitar Amplifier, Complimentary Picks, Cables, Straps, and Bag)</b> and then I also plan to buy some other <i>mystery things</i> with my check.. bahaha ;-). All I need to do I simply have someone take me to the bank tomorrow or tuesday so I can just deposit it into my account.. If you dont volunteer to do it, I'll fucking *axe* you. :-)

<b> Batman Begins Update:</b> - Still Fucking Cool.. Please Go to Theaters to see it.. Then Download it :-) (<3 Piracy). I already saw it 5 times... And Only Once Legally.. which is a shame :-( . *hopes no one of authority reads this*

Sooo, go see it then Bring me!!.. If you are a lady. I'll please you with my patented move..<b><i>""THE HURRICANE HELICOPTER""</b></i> on ride over too as a complimentary gift if you bring me ;-p...



Alrighty, I'm done. I figured I owed it to ALL my sexy fans to update this thing...... yep.....I'll eat your children O_O"

<b> Work </b> - Yep, I work tomorrow from 3pm - 11pm. Friday's arent too bad really. A decent amount of people come in. I check them in. I watch TV for a while.. :-) count it

<b> Friends </b> - I got to hang out with a few friends today, It was pretty fun. I first hung out with Jambi (Jamie) at her house for a while. It was fun, we played games like 

PARAPPA DA RAPPA. (I suck at it), FROGGER (mostly with her sister), and a PS2 KAROKE GAME (my singing.. is brilliant 8-\ ) Then Jess came by later and picked us up so we could see.........

<b> Batman Begins! </b> - We went to Lisbon to see this movie in the theater there (very nice btw) and I must say.. I never have to see another superhero movie again.. It was <b>""brilliantly amazing""</b>.. The acting was superb (Christian bale, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman). Batman Begins was a great mix of story with just enough action to knock your socks off.. the music was beautifully orcestrated and the sound effects were perfection. Dark. Mature. Funny. but most of all, Accurate to the comicbook

I give this movie

<b><i>*3 Batista Thumbs up*. It was that good!</b></i>

Well That is basically what I did today with some give and some take. So I'll catch all you sexy beasts later! Bizzzzzzzzz Bizzzzzz!!!"

<b>Work (Holiday Inn Express)</b> - Love it! I'm either standing and watching Movies on TBS. Or taking shit from 40 year old couples that vacation in PLAINFIELD.. So great :-)

<b>Friends</b> - Yeah, I have em. They are skitzos but what can ya do haha. <3 to those that can make that work for em! I hang out with them when i can: 

Either on the beach, or at the store. baseball games, they always want more. Its good to see em and they really do keep me from being bored here. Anyone else I havent seen in a while. Say ""Wutup"" sometime <i>(do me!?!)</i>

<b>Grandfather</b> - yeah he is visiting from California. its nice to see him and he bought me pizza today. I will give him points for that. I'm suppose to keep him company but I'm pretty bad at it. we usually just talk about movies, music or he asks me about my situation with the ladies to which i reply <b>""bitches love me"".</b> 8-)

<b>Guitar</b> - I'm diggin it. I can play a tune or 2. trying to learn the guitar-line for <b>""El Scorcho""</b> from Weezer. Its not bad, I really need to invest time and send the money out so I can get my Groovy Green Electric. 
<b>Callous Update:</b> Rough and Manly. Im so cool!! 

<b>Entertainment:</b> I wanted to see Batman Begins but I'll wait for friends to see it with me tomorrow. I heard alot of great reviews and I can just say ""I TOLD YOU SO"" about how badass <b>Christian Bale</b> is. 

I also been watching <b>""Wonder Showzen""</b> on MTV2 since I first saw it.. Its actually pretty funny/contraversal. I feel the need to go to church everytime I finish watching it... It's ""Sesame Street"" on <i>Acid.</i>

Thats all for today. Blastoff!!

(Just so everyone knows, I'm very cocky on purpose for my entries hah)"

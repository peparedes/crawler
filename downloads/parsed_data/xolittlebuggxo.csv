"event","Well I know its been a while since i've written but I've had so much stuff going on.  Renee and Rj moved out finally.  They got their own apartment on the other side of town.  Which I can not explain how happy I am about.  Not really even happy to get them out cuz they are my bestfriends and i didnt mind having them around all the time.  Just happy for them because now they can move forward as their own family.  Kaile has her own room and Renee has her entire own house to decorate the way she wants.  And most importantly my house is now my house.  I dont have to worry about moving other peoples things when i clean all i have to worry about is my own stuff.  Alex is doing much better now too.  He's more polite and he sleeps in his own room everynight.  (before their was so much stuff in his room that he would sleep on the living room couch)  And believe it or not EVERY room in my house is clean.  Yea i know that's a first.  I cna finally start concentrateing on my christmas shopping. I already got Alex a pair of Spiderman slippers and the Transformers movie.  I still have to get him a Ps2 and Guitar Hero.  Thats the main presents that i want to get him.  Along with clothes. and a few more little toys.  Nana is getting him Cars curtains for his room and a car ""stop light"".  Im gonna get Rob Assasins Creed for the 360 cuz that's the only game he's kept talking about.  Jaime wants movies and Lauren got a DS from my mom so i think that i'll get her a ds game. Other then that everything has been okay.  We were kinda tight on money lately but cuz Rob was sick and my job only pays me once a freakin month which sucks really bad.  But Rob had a really good month last month so it's all good now.  Well i gotta go pick Alex up and Jaime cuz OMG its Friday again!!!.  Write more later.

Ok where do I start... Alex scared the crap out of me the other day.  I was standing downstairs talking to Rob and I thought that Alex was in the house watching Tv when he came out to ask me a question... Apparently he came to close to the side and lost his balance cuz he fell down the stairs.  Luckily he only tumbled down two stairs before i ran up and caught him so he's ok but it scared the shit out of me.  I was crying and everything and i was scaring him which was totaly not my intention but I thought he was hurt and it was my fault since i wasnt right there with him but he's OK.  Besides that the pool is all set up.  the kids love it.  I put some new pics from it on my myspace.  They think its the coolest thing in the world.  Rob had a good week this week so we paid up all the back rent that we owed.  We are completely UP TO DATE!!!! Thank god.  Joe moved out I guess he went home to be with his Ex girlfriend and his son.  he's such a jerk. Although he did sell me all of his movies in exchange for the rent that I should have gotten from him last week.  we got like thirty movies off him. Rob got Apocolypto, and the xmen trilogy (among like twenty five others) and I got Boondock Saints( YAY) and a bunch more.  I bought Gone in 60 seconds.  I love that movie.  Lol the only thing that sucks is that Joe wouldnt give the kids Thundercats and that's the one movie that they really wanted.  Rob told them that he will get it for them this weekend.  Well my eyes are tyring to close on themselves so im gonna wrap up for now I'll write more tomorrow or something.  Oh and the pic ontop is from Jaime.  Shes getting a lot better at this stuff.  WEll Later <33T"

"event","Well life here is anything but relaxing.  Right now Kylie is argueing with me about having a snack she's being such a pain.  I know that Renee and Rj try their best but damn nothing is working.  Alex is bugging me to set up his pool he wants to go swimming.  Rob asked his mom if we could borrow a hose from her so that we coul put it on the water spout out front and just use the hose.  I have to go to the store today to get a tarp to put under the pool and a cover for it so it doesnt get dirty.  Jaime had another fit last night.  I wish she would out grow those damn things they are really getting on my last nerve.  Yesterday was her last day of school and she had an attitude from the moment i picked her up.  Then she started in on Lauren as soon as the poor girl got in the car.  I just dont get it Jaime is such a bitter person all the time.  It doesnt make any sense to me.  So anyways she was fighting with her sister about anything and everything and I finally said enough was enough and I wasnt dealing with it anymore so i took her with me to go pick Renee up and the little brat started yelling at me like she had a freakin foot to stand on saying that i was being unfair to her by not talking to Lauren and only taling to her so I went to turn the radio up and the jerk smacked my hand while i was driving.  I was pissed.  I said enough is enough and called my dad.  It's about time that man takes responsibility for HIS own children and stops pawning them off on me. I have my own child that I take care of, i cant pawn him off.  What the hell.  Anyways, we've decided that we are going to go to Riverfest this year and the sailfest in New London.  If anybody wants to go with us just let me know.  I watched the first half of Boondock Saints with Joe last night.  That's an AWESOME movie!!!  Im gonna finish watching it tonight.  i was getting wayyyyyyyyy to tired to even keep my eyes open last night. Well Giovanni's crying so i gotta go see what the issue is. More later... <3T"

"event","Hello again.  Well same shit differnt day.  Rob had the day off yesterday so we got laundry done.  Thank god although he was to lazy to actually help me put it away.  I swear sometimes it seems like Im on my own in this.  Im the one who makes Alex's doctors appointments and who signs him up for his orientation.  Im so sick and tired of him not doing anything.  He's busy at work. Well oh freakin well.  I have a life to and I feel like a single mother.  Rob didnt even realize that Alex's orientation was this month.  GRRRRRrrrr.  Well anyways Dad bought mikes house today I guess I should be happy for him now he gets all the money that he wanted.  Im kinda upset though.  I feel like im on the outside again. He bought the house and now him and Jay and Lauren are moving in probably this weekend.  Yippee for them.  I feel uncomfortable even going over there.  Lol.  I feel almost like Tami doesnt want me there.  She made it a point to tell me that there is not enough room in that house for 4 families.  Okay so now my father who was suppose to be trying to help me get my shit straight is now helping Tami who is constatnly talking shit about him behind his back.  I just dont get it.  It almost kinda hurts in a way.  Kinda like im unneeded.  Err I dont know.  Anyways the garden is coming along okay.  My last check for Care for kids should be in tomorrow.  Im gonna deposit into my checking account so that I have money to spare.  I was thinking about going to the beach for memorial weekend.  Maybe i'll go see Kass It was georgous up there last summer.  The only problem is that everytime that I go up to OOB I want to stay there which is bad cuz I know that I cant... All of my friends and family are here.  Oh well I guess I should go clean the house maintance is suppose to come over tonight or tomorrow to fix a pipe under the sink.  Well I'll write more later.

Well I know I havent written in a while so i'll try to make this a good one.  Ok where the hell do I start.  Dad found a house.  Its on Tracy Drive in Vernon.  We are suppose to be movin in on June 1st.  Im not quite sure about it though cuz he had to use FHA to get a lower rate for financing and the broker made him sign a paper saying that only he lived there so now Alex, Rob and I cant use that as an address.  Which I will be completely honest pisses me off cuz I dont want to have to pay 1500 dollars a month for a mortgage just to have to pay for a fuckin PO box on top of it all.  Although honestly that is the least of my worries.  Rob strikes again financially.  He has been telling me for months that the money that he has been spending was extra money and that all of the bills were paid up and stuff.  Well little did I know that the car payment for his toyota.. The ONLY car we own since my taurus blew up last summer... So anyways..Rob has been trying to tell me that everything was okay and financially we were all set but apparently we werent cuz I got woken up on Easter Sunday by a Repo company taking my toyota away.  Well I guess its kinda a good thing because I wont have to worry about a 600 dollar carpayment that I cant really afford.  Maybe now I can get a little ahead on bills.  So my dad went to Wayne and asked him how much he would want for the car that he has at his house.  We are buying that car for 700.00 which we can pay on an as you have it basis.  Hopeully we will have it registered by the end of the week. ON a happier note.  Alexs birthdya is Thursday!!! My little man will be five.  Wayne had Cheyanne this weekend for easter so dad bought pizza and an icecream cake for Alex cuz Casey and Cheyanne were here but they cant make it to his party on Sunday.  He loved spending time with them. They had a blast.  He cant wait for Sunday though.  Sometime either this week or next week he wants to go see TMNT for his bday.  I told him that we will defenitly go that I just wasnt sure which day it would be.  I like spending time with him.  I cant believe how big he's getting.  Pretty soon he'll be all grown up.. :0(  So his party is Sunday at Wickham park at 1pm.  Mikey, Zack and Nicco are going so he will hopefully have some fun with his friends there.  I hope that the weather holds out!! If not it will have to be at our house which is kinda small to fit 20 people in.  Rob is excited cuz his birthday party will be at the new house and that is defenitly big enough for all of us.  We are gonna have a cookout for the fourth of July according to dad.  I cant wait to see the fireworks.  I love Summertime. Everything is so quiet and laid back.  Lol well thats about it I should probably go try and call Kass and find out what time she'll be down here on Sunday.. Cuz if its after 11pm I dont know where we will be.Well talk to you later... <3T"

"event","Ok so it finally happened.  I realized that the rut that rob and i are in is getting really OLD.  We've been engaged since two christmas's ago.  We have done absolutely NOTHING towards actually getting married.  Its driving me crazy.  I mean if we are going to get married then why not do it now and get it over with.  Dad's mad cuz im not trying to have a huge ceremony but who would i invite?? I mean seriously my family is sooo dysfunctional.  My mom's side of the family acts like me and Kass dont even exsist.  My dad's side of the family is only here when it benefits Them somehow.  I have a few friends but not alot.  I mean wasting all that money would be pointless.  Besides maybe we can have a ceremony when we renew our vows later on in life.  I just want to be with him.  I dont care about who is there.  So we decided that we are going to go to Wickham park on June 3, 2007 and we are going to have a party but before that we are going to have a jp marry us in one of the gardens just us and Candice, and Jon of course.  And Katie too.  that way i dont have to feel bad if my sisters are there but Kass isnt.or if dad's there and mom isnt and the same for Rob.  but eveyone can be at the party.  Then Rob says we are going to go to the Woodstock Inn.  It seems really niceRob's mom is gonna take Alex for the time that we're gone.  God help that child... But hey ya gotta do whatcha gotta do.  I have absolutley NO clue where to start in planning this party or wedding thingy for that matter so i guess im gonna just wing it.  lol.  Hopefully its not to much of a disaster.  Well if anyone has any suggestions let me know they would be appreciated.  Well im off to go pick up the brat patrol i'll chek in again later. <33 T"

"event","Wow!! Thats all that I can say to describe the events of last night.  Wow.  It started off as a regular night.  I had Zack and Summer from 9:30 till Summer got picked up at 4:30, and Zack was here til quarter of seven which was fine him and Alex, and Lauren were playing snowboarding on the xbox.  When Jen came to pick him up at ten of 7 I piled Jaime and Lauren and Alex up into the car and went to the Mall.  We stayed there until nine thirty when I was suppose to meet Rob and my father outside of Barnes and NOble.  Well of course when I went outside no ONE was there.... BIg shocker huh.  so i called Rob's cell phone and I got the run around from the completely SHITFACED probably wouldnt even know my own name Rob.  WEll things just went from bad to worse there cuz after him it went Ray, then my dad, then some asshole named Chris who i swear I will PUNCH if i ever see him.  Fuckin asshole.  But anyway they were saying such nasty stuff to me and refused to put Rob on the phone so i was in tears in the movie theater parking lot.  So then we came home and when Rob got home he had the nerve to tell me that It was MY fault.  Can u believe that.  MY FAULt.. I mean i know that I am not Perfect.  By far and I am the first person to admit that.  but I do NOT under any circumstances think that i should have been treated the way I did that night and then told that it was my fault... LIke i did something bad,I watched Alex so that he coudl go out.  And I watched jaime and Lauren so my dad could.  I just dont get it  I thought that relationships were suppose to be give and take  not give give give get nothing.  Then Rob told me that he should have left me a Long time ago.. Cuz when I lived in Southwick I would always come down here with Jessica and go out and play pool or go to Denny's.  I wasnt a good mom.  We wont go there!!! I am the ONLY person in my son's life who has been there from day one and who CONTINUES to be there.  He walked out when he was with Alicia.  He didnt call him didnt come see him.  He even told the bitch that he wasnt gonna raise someone elses kid and i need to get Alexs ""real father"" to step up and be a man.  Of Course things like that are according to him "" things of the past that were said out of Anger""  but still.  Alex is a human being and I know that I have made mistakes with him in the past but how anyone at all can walk away from that little boy is beyond me.  But yet in the past so many people have.  I dont know maybe im thinking to much into it.  Well on a brighter note.  I have a laptop now ontop of the regular comptuter.mom got rid of her's cuz it was (broken) but Jon fixed it for us cuz he's good like that.  so now its working and running and all good.  IM currently laying on the bed typing away.  Well I should probably go now.  I'll write more soon.

"event","I dont really know how much more pissed off I can get before I explode.  My sister Kassandra called me up last weekend and asked me if she could come down here this week and if i could buy her a plane ticket to go see her ""fiance"" in Texas with her money.  I said fine.  I've wanted to have her move down here for a while now. I think that it would be better for her to be around her family then to  have her stay up there where she is.  So I had to ask my dad to switch his day off with Rob which sucked becuz now its Rob's normal day off and I am stuck here all alone with three screaming kids.  I just dont understand it.  I try to be the best person that I can and it doesnt get me anywhere.  Like I know that I dont have a lot of friends, I'll be the first to admit that one but what friends i do have I try really hard to keep but it doesnt always work out like that which bugs me.  Like I went completely out of my way on Saturday to bring Pam and Lily to the mall with me.  We were going to make a day out of it.  Then we went to the baby's r us store next to the mall cuz Pam wanted to scan stuff for her baby registry for the baby shower that she asked ((ME)) to plan.  So I lugged LIly who was crying cuz she didnt want to be there and Alex who was bitching cuz he couldnt use the (Laser gun) scanner around the entire store for three hours while she scanned everything in sight.  But then not even an hour later she went out again and saw Renee and her mom.  And of course when Renee asked her if she had seen me or tlaked to me she said No.  why is it so detremental for people to be my friend.  Why cant they just step up and say YEs she's my friend.  I just hung out with her an hour ago.  She was fine with hanging out with me when she wanted something.  Which is just like Nikkie.  She was fine being my friend when she needed a ride to work but when it came to being my firend it was all about Dont tell anyone we talk I dont want trouble to start.  To me that is NOT a true friend.  A true friend will not care what other people think.  but anyways I gotta go look up something online for Rob so i'll finish this later.

"event","Hey wow I havent written in this in a while so this one might be a kinda long entry.  We went to take Alex sledding on Sunday.  He had lots of fun.  So did Zack.  I have to say though I was pretty freakin scared when he went down that hill the first time.  Not cool.  I thought that he was gonna kill himself on that thing.  But he absolutely LOVED it.    Anyways.  It finally happened... Dad is getting kicked out of Patty's house.  Thank f'in god.  I cant stand that woman she drives me up a wall.  I guess its okay for her to do f'd up things but if my dad does it then its wrong.  But whatever I guess everybody is better off this way.  So I found out the other day that Kass might be moving down here permenantly.  She's been havin some issues up there and her and nick think that it would be better if she were down here with us.  To make matters worse though dad wants to buy a two family house and rent out the other half of the house and have me, jaime, Lauren, Alex and Rob live with him on one half.  I dont really know about that though cuz I dont want to loose my independence.  At first I thought that he was going to buy a two family house and we would live on the second side.  Renting from him... but now he wants us all to live on one side.  There is a nice house that hes looking at though.  its on Porter street In manchester.  Its got 4 bedrooms.  And a one bedroom effeciency apartment upstairs.  And its got 4 fireplaces, a huge living room, huge bedrooms there are like 20feet by 12 feet... (huge. The master bedroom has a fireplace in it.. and it has an enclosed porch which dad is talking about haveing a Hot tub in.  what can i say My dad is weird.  But there is an office, and a living room, an eat in kitchen, two bedroom's upstairs with their own enterence from outside, a stair case that leads into the kitchen and their own personal bathroom.  I thnk i like the sounds of this house.  And it is in the Highland Park school district which means by the time Alex starts school He will be in a good neighborhood.  FINALLY.. He can go to a good school and meet Nice new friends.  I really hope that my dad decides to get it.  I think that I will be fine living with him again as long as i have my own privacy.. Besides the man has nothign and he's gonna spend all his money on moving in.  He's not gonna have enough money to pay for anything else like furniture or a tv or anything.  So I figure we can take our furniture.. He'll redo the house to look nice. we'll redo room nice.  Paint Alex's to look like cars and it will work out alright.  Kass can come down and live with us and whatever I cant take care of for her... He will handle.   lets just hope that everything works out now.  Cuz i have this issue with always getting my hopes up and think ing everything is gonna be ok and work out.. and theKABAMMM everything falls apart.  Well write more later..

Rent a center came yesterday to take back the computer and the tv that we were renting becuz we couldnt deal with the attitudes all the time that we were getting from the people that work there.  Besides we decided that it would just be cheaper to save our money for a week and buy the stuff that we had from them.  We own the bedroom set now so we dont have to worry about that anymore.  We have our old computer back which is ok cuz it works <obviously>  the only issue is that myspace will NOT open for anything.  I dont get it I can go on any other website that i want but if i try to go on myspace it laughs at me.  I dont get it.  I know that we need to get a new graphix card maybe that is the problem.  Well enough ranting and raving  I gotta go cuz Summer is on her way up the stairs.  I'll be back later to finish my rant on the stupidity of my computer.

"event","Well I saw this today on my friend Melanies blog and I had to show everyone.  For everyone who is a parent you will know what I am talking about or for everyone who lives with a man who has the mental capacity of a child.  You would also feel me on this one.. so here it is.


Recently, I was diagnosed with C. A. A. D. D. - Child Activated Attention Deficit Disorder. This is how it manifests:

I decide to do the laundry. As I start toward the
basement, I notice that there are cheerios all over
the floor and my car keys are in the cereal bowl.

I decide to pick up the cheerios before I do the
laundry. I lay my car keys down on the counter, put
the cheerios in the trash can under the counter,
and notice that the trash can is full. So, I decide to
take out the trash.

But then I think, since I'm going to be near the
mailbox when I take out the trash I may as well pay
the bills first. I take my checkbook off the
table, and see that there is only one check left, my extra
checks are in my desk in the office/playroom, so I
go to my desk where I find a sippy cup full of
juice. I'm going to look for my checks, but first I
decide I should put the sippy cup in the
refrigerator to keep it cold.

As I head toward the kitchen with the sippy cup a
vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye --
they need to be watered. I set the sippy cup on the
counter, and I discover baby wipes that I've been
searching for all morning. I decide I better put
them back in the bathroom, but first I'm going to
water the flowers.

I set the wipes back down, fill a container with
water and suddenly I spot the TV remote, one of the
kids left it on the kitchen table. I realize that
after school when they go to watch TV, I will be
looking for the remote as they fight over who lost
it, but I won't remember that it's on the kitchen
table, so I decide to put it back in the den where
it belongs, but first I'll water the flowers.
I splash some water on the flowers, but most of it
spills on the floor. So, I set the remote back
down, get some paper towels and wipe up the spill.
Then I head down the hall trying to remember what I
was planning to do.
At the end of the day: the laundry isn't washed,
the bills aren't paid, there is a warm cup of juice
sitting on the counter, the flowers aren't watered,
there is still only one check in my checkbook, I
can't find the remote, I can't find the wipes, and
I don't remember what I did with the car keys.
Then when I try to figure out why nothing got done
today, I'm really baffled because I know I was
busy all day long, and I'm really tired.

I realize this is a serious problem, and I'll try
to get some help for it, but first I'll check my
myspace."

"event","Ok so finally I dont feel like I am coming to my untimely demise.  I have been sick for the past three days and finally thank god I feel like I am finally completely here. I guess what they say is true.  You have to hit bottom before you can climb back up cuz yesterday was Horrible.  My head hurt and I thought that I was gonna die.  Last night it got its absolute worst I felt like if I stood up and tried to walk I was gonna fall back down and die.  The couch was my permanant home and it sucked.  Rob did his best to try and take care of me though.  I dont get it with him.  One minute he can be the nicest guy in the world and the next minute he acts like all he cares about is himself and everyone else can go to hell.  For example.... Yesterday morning. He promised Candice that he would take care of Summer cuz her and Jose didnt want Summer to get sick again since she just got better two days ago.  Anyways so Rob wakes me up when they get here at 10 saying that I need to be sociable (it will make me feel better) so then he proceeds to go sit in front of the computer while barking orders at me to feed summer and change summer and blah blah blah!!!  So then he gets a phone call from my dad which is always a Pleasure*rolls eyes* telling him that Frank is mad so of course the way I feel doesnt matter he tells me Oh i have to go to work for a few hours to see if i can make a deal happen. (like the 70 hours a week that he has to work mandatory arent enough)  So he leaves me with a pounding headache, running nose, sinus pressure and tears welling up with three kids that cant wait for him to leave so they can run rampid and tells me well this is somthing that I have to do.  Why couldnt he just stay home and take care of them for me??? Was it really that much to freakin ask... But anyways it doesnt matter now cuz i feel better.  I just wish that he would take his head out of his ass and stop caring about material things and start caring about PEOPLE!!!!.

Ok today is Tuesday December 5, 2006 and I am bored out of my mind.  I dont have the kids until 2:30ish.  My nose is stuffy and my head hurts, I really dispise being sick.  It bites.  Alex and Gizmo are curled up on the new couch watching blues clues.  I like the couch I mean its not like brand new but hey it will do.  I mean the RAC one was 4,000 dollars and it was less comfortable then this one and i only paid ten dollars for this.  Jess and Greg helped Rob move it up last night cuz i was just way to sick to even try.  This bug has made me really weak.  I hate not feeling normal, my life is stressfull enough. I found out last night that Renee had actually turned on the gas here and that it affected the heat and the hot water.  so needless to say it got shut off yesterday leaving the house absolutely freezing and NO hot water.  Thank god I took a shower last night before it happened so Im good.  Dad turned the gas back on in his name since me and Rob both have bills that we were worrying about trying to fix.  Luckily we will only need it for a month cuz January first we move to the other house and the heat there is included in my freakin 1200 a month rent cuz its OIL.  So it will also be in dad's name.  I got yelled at again for using my cellphone to much.  He just never gives me a break on anything.  On to other topics that dont make me quite as MAD.  Dad is signing the papers this week for the house and the closing is suppose to be december 31st.  He says that before we move in he is going to paint the rooms.  I know that i want the bathroom Ivy green again.  Thats the color that the bathroom was at 38 Maple.  I liked it.  I want my room to be a blue color cuz my comforter is Blue with Stars and moons.  The living room I am assuming will be a beige color or maybe like a light blue.  Cuz the couch is white and light green.  Alex's room is going to be CARS.  He absolutely adores Lighting McQueen.  Dad is buying him the Comforter.  I talked to him about it yesterday.  I cant wait.  Im already trying to find people who will help us move.  I asked Matt he said that he would see what he could do.  I have to say for everything we have been through I am so greatful for him.  He is still there for me when I need him.  Anyways I dont think that Jose will help cuz hes got his head up his ass again.  But what else is new.  if only he would learn that his actions have consequences... What HE does causes her to treat him the way she does... NOT ME!!! Im so sick of getting blamed for his stupidity.  You would think that I would have learned my lesson by now.  I guess not.  Jess said it best yesterday.  I always have issues with my ""friends"" because i always go back to the same people.  Maybe its time to move on and find Friends that will actually be TRUE FRIENDS.  OH well enough ranting and raving for today I gotta go get ready for the kids to get her.

"event","Oh my god is it cold in this freakin house.  For some reason I dont think that the stupid heat is working.  They came to get the couch today.  I cant wait til the other one comes.  This room looks so empty without it though.  So i guess that my dad is signing the papers on his new house tonight.  We will be moving in on the first of january.  Im gonna get Alex a bunch of CARS stuff for his new room. Im getting him sheets and a comforter for his bed, wall decorations, a tv-dvd combo, and some posters.  other then that im gonna get some toys and clothes.  Anyways on yuckier topics Lauren got me sick.  My nose is stuffy and my eyes are runny and my head hurts.  I nose is so freakin stuffy that it hurts.  I hate it.  Well my head hurts like you would not believe so im gonna go.  I'll write more later.

Ok well there are officially 35 days until Christmas which means that there are two days till Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving is at our house this year again.  We got the turkey two days ago.  At least Rob will be home this Wed so he can help me make some of the food.  He wasnt home last year and so I didnt have any help.  Errr It sucked. I had to make all the food alone and it was almost a disaster.  I love the holidays dont get me wrong.  I love the decorations and the cold weather and all that good stuff.  I LOOOOVVVVEEE it.  I jsut dont like being overwhelmed.I mean dont get me wrong. I know that i can cook.  I know that the food will be good and i know that everything will work out in the end I just dont like the whole having to do it all by myself.  NOT COOL.  So anyways Luckily I dont have to worry about that becuz I will have Rob here to help me with it.  <br>
So Besides that dad is going to find out if he gets that new house on Union Pl.  I hope that he does.  I want to move. I absolutely HATE this apartment.  I want OUT now!!!!  The entire thing is a disaster.  Im afraid to go on the front porch cuz im afraid that the damn thing is gonna fall over.  You cant even close Alex's bedroom door cuz its to small for the doorway.  The bottom screendoor on the porch has no handle and the top door the handle is broken.  The roof is finally fixed but you really dont think that the idiots could come re patch and repaint the ceiliing in my LIVING ROOM.. They just dont care and I hate it.  I would much rather just have dad buy that house on Union and clean it up myself.  I would take the time and fix the things that are broken if i knew that I would get some sort of appreciation for it.  I just really dont want to live in a management property anymore cuz they just dont care.  Oh well enough babbling for now.  I will write more tomorrow.

Well tomorrow is Halloween.  Alex is all set with his costume.  He decided this year that he wanted to be Clifford the big red dog.  I cant believe that it is finally Halloween.  We have done so much stuff this year.  Two halloween parties and a trick or treating.  Geesh It feels like it should freakin be christmas already.  Anyways.  Alex went to Trick or Treating at the campground in Salem.  he loved it everyone was like ""oh look its Clifford the Big Red doggy.  he's soooo cute"" so now the kid has a complex.  I do have to say that he looks adorable in his costume.  He is such a cutie pie kid.  We went to Laurens school for a halloween party on Friday.  That was fun to say the LEAST.  Alex got scared becuz he say a kid in a warewolf costume.  EXCELLENT.  I felt so bad for him.  but he got over it and him and Jay went to every table and did all the cool stuff.  We made halloween chocolate chip cookies last night.  I love this time of the year. I cant wait to go Christmas tree picking and decorate it and make decorations for the tree.  Last year we made decorations with Alex & Zacks name on them.  This year we are going to have to make one for Summer.  Her birthday is next week.  I still have to remember to get her a present.  Side note!! you can tell that christmas is coming cuz all of the freakin toy commercials are coming on the tv.  Alex say a commercial for some digital camera from fisher price and he wants that.  Greg said that Cars comes out next week so i'll have to remember to save money to get it for him for xmas too.  I want to go to NY with Kass this christmas to see the Rockafeller center tree and go iceskating.  I think that we are gonna go.  I cant wait for the holidays.  Thanksgiving is at our house this year apparentaly.  Which is not really a big  shock to me cuz its at our house EVERY year No when else in my disfunctional family ever has thanksgiving apparenatly they dont believe in holidays. I think that Jon and his mom might come this year.  They did last year and it was great.  Rob loves his family so much but they are all very busy and so he never gets a chance to see them.  I know that he is hoping that they can come down.  Oh well enough babbling for today i'll write more again soon.

Wow is it cold outside.. brrrr brrr.  Im sitting here Freezing inside I can just imagine what its like outside.  Alex is watching the Wiggles again.  I swear thats all that the kid does is watch tv.  Zack and Summer start coming here on the first thank god.  Then maybe he will actually play with toys with Zack instead of just sitting her all day everyday glued to a tv set.  So besides that me and Dad have gotten into another fight.  I really hate how he treats me.  He is soo snobby and stuck up and if things arent going his way he gets so pissed off.  I couldnt go pick up jaime at school the other day and the spoiled brat called my dad and told him that i was choosing my friends over him so he got pissed at me and told me that iam unreliable and irresponsible.  I dont know who the hell he thinks he's talking to cuz if it wasnt for me his kids would be ALONE 99% of the time and when they were'nt alone they would be Miserable with their freakin grandmother.   So I found out today that I have to be ""responsible"" this weekend for bringing the brats to bowling again.  Which kinda pisses me off cuz I was going to try and take Alex to the trick or treating which is always the Saturday before Halloween.  But of course my child always comes last.  I havent heard from Kass in a week.  I hope she's okay.  Nick left on Monday morning really early.  he wont be back for 3 years.  Well except for holidays and such.  Kyle bragged yesterday that he had started talking to her again.  I can't keep up.  Paige bitched to me and told me that i wasnt a good sister.  Whatever bitch.  At least I try to be there for my sister and i try to back her up.  In other Terri news me and Rob got into another fight last night.  He went on myspace the other night looking for alicia.  Tell me something.  If your over someone and you dont want them in your life at all then why the hell are you going to waste your time looking for them.  He wont tell her about his life he just wants to make sure that everything with her is okay.  My god give me a break.  Do you see me chasing Matt down like a little puppy dog?? No.  But whatever.  Well I guess I should go for now.  I'll write back more later.  Hopefully it will be more pleasent then this Whinney crap.

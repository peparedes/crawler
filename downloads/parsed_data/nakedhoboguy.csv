last night was pretty damn cool. went to the show and that was neat, the ... The Traitor's Aspect? well the first band was pretty good but i felt bad for em cause no one was there because it was like 4 in the morning (actually like 1 in the afternoon but still.)then there was a billion minute wait untill the next band showed up so me, kyle, coltin, chris, sarah, kandace, and sam went to taco bell. we ordered whatever but sam went to get dr. pepper and it was the sickest stuff ever!! it kinda looked like chocalte syrup fresh from the bottle, or maybe 2 month old oil leaking for a car. but it didnt taste good. however mountain dew baja blast tastes incredible. when we came back nikki was that and that was coolarooni cuase i was hoping she'd be there. then The Broken Chords played, they're pretty pootinanny awesome. i went up to em to get a cd but they were out and so there manager gave me his card and said to give him a call in a week or so, so he could send me some shat. and then me and the band started talkin so it was pretty cool. then i had to go to my cousins b-day party, she was turning 13 so it was a big deal, and i missed legalize so that sucked. then i went to a party with sarah and nikki. the party was more a mild shindig with the broken chords so i got to know em even more which was even more cooler. so now im on the in crowd with these guys on fuse, a biker gang, and some mexican gangsters. SOWEET. OH MY GOD. today i made the cooooolest legalize thing ever. its another picture that can go on a shirt or whatever so im gonna make a back patch out of it. but i used the label from a Carmex tube thing and it is extremely bad ass. 

oh yea, there's a show on December, Monday the 27th starting at 6-30. Its gonna be at the elks lodge( the big pink building next to the late great Vista Lanes.) Angel City Outcasts are gonna play, along with The Assailants, Line of Fire, and Fletcher. More bands are most likely going to play but they arent sure who yet. the end.

hows it been? lately i've been kind of working and kind of living outside of my computer for a while and it was nice while it lasted, but now its winter and to cold to work and such so i am back to le computadora. so hows everyone been? lately it seems everyone is leaving and that blows. kali, a gay gay (thats this guys halo name but i dont know his real name even though we know eachother?), ed. and countless numbers of people are leaving to peptech and i hate zem all! not really but its not nice. i havent worked on my book lately but thats okay cuase i've been busy with school and all. legalizepeace.com is up and running which is supa cool ass. oh, and the first to pictures on that site, the one with the cop car and the save ska, i made those bitches. i'm quite suprised to find them on the site but its cool ass anyways. i really like this one girl and you might know who she is, you might not. either way, somethings gonna happen sooner or later. me and clint are gonna try and have the Eco-rangers club out and about when we et back from x-mas break. theres a show next weekend and that should be extra swell. legalize peace, circumcizing satan, (now known as catalyst soul) and its allll day. hopefully i can see that girl i like there and we'll talk and what not. i finally saved up and now i have a lot of money like, 150 bucks? but it sucks cause x-mas is coming and i dont want to spend any of it, im not being selfish, cause i wont mind if i dont get much, but it took a long time for me to save it all up and not spend it on gay shat like tiki-lamps and scuba diving lessons. but i will spend it on shat like the new legalize peace demo that is rumored to come out at the show, along with other merch. i thought about maybe putting liquid nails in my hair so i would never have to deal with it again. well, not for a while. i wanted to get my permit soon so i could get my liscence before schools out but i think im just gonna wait till im 18 and get it that way. yea it'll take longer but im way to lazy to try. talking about being lazy just makes me feel lazier so im gonna go to sleep now. its 5 o'clock but who cares. goodnight.

so we finally got... the stuff *wink* i found some flour in my pantry thing and a few bottles of oregano,itailan seasoning,dill weed. it all looks like it so its cool. we're probably going to do it... sometime next week, not monday cuase most people will forget by then... maybe thursday.. friday. we're also collecting cans. so far we have twenty cans in the passenger side of clints truck, we're making it so that when you open the door the cans fall out and you look like a jack ass. we found most of em on the side of the road so its helping the enviroment too. about ten of em are beer cans, one of em is a pint size bud light. nicccce. hereford road is loaded with cans so we're gonna go can fishing tomorow. it'll be the shizznack. the end.

"event","today was cool, fifth hour was pretty awsome. tyrel (the mentally chalenged black kid) didnt say much today, but he kept singing with hopes to figure out the theme song of his ""Tyrel Show"" or otherwise known as ""ymsmd"" which stands for ""your mom sucks my dick"" now imagine a skinny, black, mental kid, with gangster clothes on, and a speach impetiment. thats how funny it was. i'm not making fun of him, im describing him. during lunch me and clint walked to my locker to get my soda, my locker is in the very back of the retard hallway. its right across from the mentally chalenged room. as we were walking there we noticed some people out side. they were fighting. a lady at the door kept looking back and forth as if covering for the people. we figured they were two normal people fighting and didnt want to get caught. as we got closer the one person sat down and cried, we figured he lost. then he got up, screamed, and took off after the guy. we continued to watch and soon relized it was a mental kid fighting a mental kid supervisor. the lady called for another man and so he went out there and helped. now remember, these are two grown men, that are trained for this, trying to restrain a mentally challenged child. this kid to them both on and kicked there asses. me and clint were chuckling, trying to hide our laughing, another lady came out of a room and went outside and said, ""Take him down!"" this caused a sudden burst of laughter from both me and clinton. to try and not be disrespectful, we walked away. as we wlaked we heard them radio some security gaurds to come and help. me and clint had just witnessed a 14/15 year old retard boy kick the shit outta two 30-40 year old men. this was probably the highlight of my day. that or talking with samantha, yea, shes a bad ass. the end.

<P>tomorow me and clint are filling my breifcase with flour and oregano (fake cocaine and marijuana) we are going to pass the briefcase around with stealthyness and open it here and there, all suspicious like, to let inoccent bystanders see the goods. if you go to buena, you are most likely going to retrive the breifcase at sometime, if you get it, pass it to one of your friends, tell them ""pass this to a friend, the code is 'do you have the stuff' "" then walk away. it doesnt matter who they are, as long as they dont leave it in the middle of the floor. the locks are 333 777 and it will be written on there. hopefully the security will tackle someone for ""drugs"" and it will be supa bad ass. there will be a note inside the briefcase explaining the whole plan so if a friend recieves the case and does not know what to do, the note will tell. thank you for your kindness, i am sorry luke that you cannot contribute on account of you dont go to buena. the end.</P>

"event","Imagine you are being hunted and there's no place to hide. 

You can't run because you're fenced in. But chances are, you won't run anyway.
You trust those who hunt you. After all, they feed you and give you water -- you
depend on them to survive.

Then one day, a day like any other, the people you trust arrive with your food.
But this time, there's a stranger with them.

A sudden shot rings out. Then another. You never saw it coming. There's no
chance of escape. You are slaughtered without pause -- so long as you remain an
attractive trophy for their wall, the pain and length of your death is of no
concern to your killer.

This is the life of a canned hunt victim. Canned hunting, in which tame, captive
animals are shot within enclosed areas, represents a particularly cruel and
unsporting form of trophy hunting.    And it must be stopped

If you showed me another article saying the exact oppisite stuff, i would most likely agree to that to. that is why i just make my opinions on little things:

George W. Bush - got beat up by a snack food, waved to stevey wonders (a blind man)
John Kerry - fucking stupid hair, wants to be rid of those laws that save endangered species (i get a newsletter and i told me that) and i just plain dont like the guy

so in my case, i vote for ANARCHY! haha no i dont. BUT I HAD YOU GOIN THERE! i think anarchy is a silly goverment or un-government. thats why i think we should all have an equal say in stuff, and we should have a king. (not with kingly powers, but just a guy to sit on a throne and look bad ass) and every once and a while we should have ""VACATION WEEK"" where everybody in the usa gets a one week vacation and a tiny 500 dollar check in the mail payed for by the great tax payers of america. and i think EVERYONE should know that there is no law that says you have to pay income tax. and i think everyone should have a super soaker of some kind so they can spray the shit outta neighbors that have there dogs take poo's on the lawn. so dont pay your income tax, obey the mighty king, pray vacation week is soon, soak your neighbor, and say stuff that equals.

"event","Yesterday night sucked so much. i was chating with jillian and i must have said something, but i have no idea what, and now she hates me. i hate it. not her, i love her, but i hate it. i felt like crying. i havent felt that way since my uncle died a while back. i dont know. i went to my room and actually thought of shit. i thought of suicide(not for long but i did), i thought of cutting myslef. i thought about screwing everything i do and starting drugs, smoking, drinking. i thought just why bother. it was wierd. i've never thought about stuf like that before. i felt like a cocaroach. i could survive so much like my g-ma staring me in the face and telling me that she was gonna die. or seeing my uncle one night and in the morning he's dead. i can survive all that but then one person fucking crushes me. its probably just the fact of losing a good friend. i haaaaaate it. oh well. today my dad is having a party with his biker gang so im allowed to hang out in town and stuff. i see yall's later.

"event","HOLY SHIT WE HAVE A REAL (soon to be) SUPERHERO ON THIS WORLD. these german scientists found this baby and this baby has huge freaking muscles . its because of blocked production of a protein called myostatin. i hope he turns into a real superhero. that would be so awsome. then we could have one just like him shipped to sierra vista. we dont have that much crime down here but it would be cool if we had a superhero.

"event","today was great
in school we had a play called ""A Midsummer Night's Dream""
i was the prop manager. hehe
we didnt have many prop items 
so we stole the whole rack of butcher paper from the jaitors closet
originally i wasnt supposed to have a part in the play
i traded this guy for his part for only two caprisuns
it was a two line part but i got to sing
i was a farie named mote
i dressed up with full pert breast (made of paper)
and a long skirt (made of pink paper) with a paper crown
i was the only one with enthusiasm
its true, you can ask bert, nate, or kyle. they saw it
then we watched Willow
it looks to me like Lord Of The Rings is a spoof off of Willow
its true, just imagin the baby in Willow as the ring
then after school, me, clint, and kandace went to dunin donuts again
this time we were offically regulars because the lady asked if we wanted the usuall
then we went to kandaces house 
on the way we were dumbfounded by a sppeding car that barely missed us
so natuarlly we chased it down
it was on my side of the truck so i had to do the dirty work
i yelled at the probably mid-30's aged guy 
""SLOW DOWN ASS!""
he looked at me and laughed
then we got to kandaces house without driving around the neighborhood
i met kand's dad 
we played halo on the big screen
i beat clint (when kand was covering clints eyes)
then we took all of kand's starbursts
then me and clint left 
i had to shift the whole way home cause clint had a soda in his hand
on the way home i threw numerous starburts out the window 
they travel as fast as us for like three seconds
then i got home
                   The End"

"event","today was great. 
school was normal.
i put a picture of Ghandi on the projector.
on the way out of buena me, kandace, and clint played really loud orchestra music
i conducted the orchestra with a pencil
clint sang like a italian oprah man
kandace tried to stear the car
we almost hit three cars and a curb
the speaker almost blew me up
on the road we listened to more classical music
put the windshield wipers on when it wasnt raining
they turned into mutants
it started raining
we turned the wipers off
almost hit two more cars
stopped at dunkin donuts
ordered a sprinkle donut
got a sprinkle donut and a nasty ass strawberry cream filled one
went to the bathroom when the bathroom was pitch black
guess where the toilet was
guessed right
became regulars at dunkin donuts
drove around kandaces town for another 15 minutes
went inside
clint found kandaces room
i found the closet
i farted in the closet (sorry kandace)
wanted some of kandaces nuts
me and clint listened to mexican music
i shifted/steared the truck
went mud bogging
found a new computer at my house"

"event","alright so the weekends over, well it is for me. thursday i got reaquainted with stone, we're old time buddies but we havent talked in a while. met a hardcore straight edge guy from alaska. i finally met jilly, shes so cool... and hot. i almost had to sneek into my own house but clint saved my life. We went four wheeling hoping to make it to johns b-day party, but everyone got scared cause they thought the cops called so then we went to clints house. practiced halo, i got online as he slept, jilly and i had a crazy conversation that i wouldnt mind forgetting. woke up at three-ish. played more halo. ate a burrito with clints homeade hot sauce.  went out to clints car to get a different shirt and found out that when AXE deoderant bottles get too hot inside a car, they blow up with enough power to rip a backpack pocket clean off. drove to no where with clint, ended up at the mall. met a guy named paul and a guy named tim. hes fat. hung out with them and reese. reese cleared it up that i am from now on ""Timmy"" and the fat guy is ""Tim"". listened to big robs acid trip stories, the good and the bad ones. hung out wiht jilly and rusty and chris and some other people. bought a gum ball. went to go see ""dodgeball"" with jilly and hannah and chris but chris didnt go. (by the way all of you should see dodgeball cause its damn funny. and if you do see it THEN STAY UNTIL AFTER THE CREDITS. its the best part, trust me.) hung out with jilly and hannah and angie and asia and jamie and gabe and reece and probably some other people. went to a halo party. i got last every time. well, the first time i beat reece and got second to last. went to my moms house at three in the morning. went to sleep, woke up, played video gomes for the rest of the day. the highlights of this story has to be meeting jillian and hearing robs acid trip stories.

 instead of oompa-loompa, what should the people be called
 instead of Willy Wonka, what should his name be.

anyways its funny. i cant really write the story in order, i go from chapter this to chapter that. so far i have the first page, a page that would be around the fifth or sixth. and one thats near middle, and the ending page. SO. what should they freaking be called. thanks. bye"

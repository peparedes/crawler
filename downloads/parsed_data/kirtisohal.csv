Then she showed us around.... we went to yogurt park...sooooo goood even htough i always feel really sick afterwards! Then we went to visit lesley's friend in unit 2 and we met all his roomates and friends. One of his roomates knows one of my friends here at UOP! that was weird! ANyways that was fun just hanging out. After that anisha and jessica got back and we visited them and ended up sleeping in anisha's room since her roomies were gone. It was mucho fun caatching up wiht everyone..... I MISS U GUYS! Saturday we drove into the city and went to fisherman's wharf and ate bread bowls.. yumm!  We just walked around did some shopping blah blha blha... my roomate really loved it and wants to live there and i cant wait myself to be in grad school there :)!

It was originally going to be me felicia krissy lisa and danielle but then lisa had a doctors appt. so she said she would join us later and felicia had to go to the mall with her mom so it was me krissy and danielle. We went through the Mrs. Fields book that felicia gave us and decided to make gingerbread men and these chocolate/peanut butter chunk thingies. We didn't realize how much work baking was haha and how fatty it is! wholly shit all the butter/sugar/chocolate we used... WOW! Anywayss i dont know why but it was just soo funny we couldn't stop laughin the whole time! But it was good fun. Anyways we were baking from like 1 to 6 or soemthing! And when eerything was done... it tasted like shit. hahahaha! Actually the peanut butter and chocolate bars were pretty good but the gingerbread men were definately not! haha as danielle said... as long as they look pretty it doesn't matter how they taste. haha I brought some home for my family but no one at any haha! And then at nite i went to PF Changs for dinner with my family. Today I went to the mall and got myself a super cute jacket! And tonite i'm goin to priya's house for a xmas party. I hope she likes wut i got her! Even though tomorrow is xmas i dont think my family really has anything planned haha Usually we have like a big dinenr wtih the family but this year a lot of my family is out of town :( So i guess i'll just lounge around the house... maybe i'll bake! hah! Actually tomrorow i have to pack for ny. My room is like a disaster cause when i got back from uop i just ilke dumped everything on the floor and all over my bed. It looks liek my closet threw up!

Coming home made me so fucking happy. Like just driving through fremont made me emotional... whats wrong with me?! I met up with lisa and danielle at starbucks. Seeing them was so nice... thanx for my present!its hidden in the trunk of my car!haha Then Felicia came and we all just sat there talking. Those are the best times... just sitting around with your good freinds talking. I swear i took it for granted. We all decided we would meet up for halloween which gives me hope for the future. Then i went home and right when i saw my mom i started crying. once again... what's wrong with me?! Im so freakin homesick. I've realized that i think this is just like the akward stage where im trying to settle in... even though i thought that stage was over. Tomorrow is my birthday and my parents are coming to stockton to take me and some of my college friends out for dinner. Shall be fun! now i have to study for a stupid public speaking test! bye!"

"event","I can't decide if i like this place. At first I liked it because it was new and the idea of college seemed so cool. And i was enjoying spending time with my roomate and getting to know people in the hall. Of course they were all like the superficial introductions where you dont really even remember the person's name afterwards but it was still cool. I really thought i would click with a lot of people and that we would all hang out. But then as time passed I realized i was wrong. Everyone in my hall is really boring. All they do is study and go to bible study. The only fun person is my roomate, thank god. I dont know why but this doesn't really feel like college.... maybe this school is just too damn small. We dont even have a football team.... which means we have like no school spirit whatsoever. Maybe i just need to switch dorm halls... our hall is like a study hall. And the workload is soo much! im taking chem and bio at the same time... too much studying! Im thinking about getting out of the program altogether and transfering but im not sure. I just dont wanna graduate from a college and feel like i never really got the college experience."

Everyone i meet here is really cool, but i cant help but think about you guys. I guess i know in the back of my mind that the friendships we had will never be the same again. Hopefully i'll get the chance to get close to some people here at UOP so i dont miss u guys so much! I cant wait to see you all tomorrow, but im kind of sad too becuase its the last time we'll all be together in this period of our lives. I love you guys."

"event","Well, I'm finally at college. Thursday was the first day of orientation and i moved in that day. The day before that i hung out with my friends one last time. It was fun becuase at night me, felicia, krissy, lisa, and courtney hopped the fence at shannon's and went swimming at like 9 pm. We stayed there for like 1 or 2 hours and then i left to go home and pack. Orientation was kind of stupid and pointless becuase the lectures didn't really help at all. All i got out of it was a id card and registration for classes. Then they also had all these like lame dance parties. But i got to meet a lot of cool people and eveyone is soooo friendly. My roomate is a really nice girl from hawaii.... mannn i love her accent! She brought me chocolate covered macadamian(however u spell that) nuts! It was still hella weird though not having all my close friends there. There were so many times where i wished they could be there with me to laugh at certain things... we understand each other and our humor. I still havent' gotten used to the idea of making a whole new group of friends but the fact that my residence hall has really nice friendly people makes it easier. It's a nice little community... kind of like a family.lol Anyways I'm gonna go to sleep now cause its been a long ass day. gnite."

Then we all met up at Borders. Then we walked to taco bell cause danielle wanted a burrito. After that Lisa and Krissy went home and Danielle and I went on an adventure. First we decided to go to costco to get pics developed. By the time we got there we realized we both didnt' have our costco cards. Luckily, the photo stand thign is outside. But, we still watned to go in to get free samples. So, we snuck in while the costco man wasn't looking. BUT THERE WERE NO FREE SAMPLES! So, we decided to go to Albertsons to eat their ""free"" stuff. We just ate some candy. Then we went into the dollar store and looked at all the junk in there. After this Danielle dropped me off at my car and i went home. That night Krissy and Lisa slept over. Courtney was supposed to but she had to wake up early this morning for an appointment so she stayed home. Lisa brougth over CHIM CHIMMENY CHIM CHIM....hahaha! We watched everything on her Greatest Hits DVD her mom made for her. It was soooo cute! Little lisa singing! haha then we just watched tv and talked and fell asleep pretty early, we were party poopers. Then we hung out this morning watching tv and eating which is always lots of fun! Sorry i had to kick u guys out for the dog!! I luv all my girls and i'm gonna miss them sooo much when i go to boring stockton. bye! sorry that this entry was so boring!"

So then me lisa and krissy got ready adn left. We visited courtney at starbucks because she wanted to see us before we left:). So we chatted for a bit and then we left. When we got to the club we met these guys and asked them aabout my ""id"" haha While one of them hit on krissy;) the others were telling me and lisa my id was flimsy haha!But they thought it would work anywways. When we got in line everyone looked hella old and all done up! we seriously went in like jeans and flip flops haha! We were just goin to see what it was like. Then we overheard some people talking and they siad that it was 2 if u were on the guestlist. and the security guy said it was 20 without guest listt. hahahaha! At this point we were all hella alughing at each other and trying to find the best way to subtly leave the line without looking like idiots. When we finally left we decided to try adbn go to the super saver in milpitas and see if we could watch mean girls but it was 1030and we were liek 30 mins late for everything playing. So we went back to fremont and drove by justin medlock's party to see how it was but i dont think andyone was there yet and then we went to mcdonalds and got food and went bakc to krissy's house and ate! I got home around 12 and went to sleep! Then at like 4 am i was awakened when my loud brother got home from justin's party. He was talkin to my parents about how he got in a fight or something? and i heard my cell phone go off but it think he picked it up.

I mean we'll see each other once in a while, but it will never be the same. I know high school is over-glamorized a lot of the times, but it really is a big part of your life. And its weird but the memories that stick out the most are from little things like late night study groups at baystreet :). These 4 years have showed me who my real friends are. I'm so glad I got to meet a new group of friends this year, they've really taught me a lot about myself and what friendship is about. I love you guys soo much and i'll really miss you. For now, I guess I'll just try to enjoy these last few days together and look forward to the fun summer ahead of us.

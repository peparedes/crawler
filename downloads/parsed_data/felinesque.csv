"event","Hello All,
 
 So as some of you know my purse was lost on Sunday. Now it's beginning to appear as it has been stolen and is therefore lost forever. I lost my makeup, my phone, my iPod, my Charlie Card, my gloves, basically all my important stuff. I luckily had my old phone and got a sim card for that last night, but of course I lost all of my numbers. My number is still the same; 508-596-6664. Please send me your numbers at felinesque at gmail dot com so I can rebuild my phone book.
 
 On another note ( a more happy one) Steven and I are having a shin dig at our house to celebrate my Birthday (which is Tuesday the 25th). The party is on Saturday, November 22 at 8:00 pm, because no one wants to party on a Tuesday. We are making it an appetizer potluck, so bring your favourite appetizer and whatever you would like to drink and come join us for some fun. Presents are not necessary just your presence. Hope to see you there. Give a call to Steven or I if you have any questions!!
 
 Peace,
 Veronica

"event","Hello All,

I need your help. So I finally moved in with Steven, which is wonderful, but there is only one drawback. . . there are no pets allowed in the house. So it is with a heavy heart that I ask if anyone could possibly give her a home.&nbsp; She is one year old, very sweet, with short black hair.&nbsp; She is fixed and has all her shots.&nbsp; She's very mellow most of the time, but still has plenty of kitten in her.&nbsp; She is fairly small and I don't think she is going to get much bigger.


Please, please, please if you or anyone you know can take her let me know.&nbsp; If I cannot find a home for her by Thursday I am going to have to take her to a no-kill shelter and that will break my heart.

Thanks for listening,
Veronica"

"event","Okay so it is finally sunny outside, but I feel like warmed over shit inside my head.  Physically I feel fine.  I feel like I can't quite get a grasp on the things going on in my life.  I have this distinct out-of-control feeling but I am not actually doing anything that would seem out of control.  I am very overwhelmed by everything.  When I sit down to talk to people about it to try to get a grasp on it and bounce my theories ont them to see what the hell is going on, they pretty much tell me that I am just thinking too much.  Which I can believe, because alot has changed over the last 4 months.  What's funny is that, despite a recent blow to my ego, almost all the change has been either extremly good or exactly what I wanted to happen.  So why do I feel so overwhelmed?  I think that in part it is that I am succeeding in my life exactly how I have always wanted it and I am getting older and now part of me rally needs to act like an adult and be responsible ALL the time.  Those of you who know me are familiar with my devil-may-care fuck-'em-if-they-can't-take-a-joke philosophy that has been the better part of my life.  I have always survived, but I was rarely happy.  Now I have everything in front of me to be happy, it is all right in my grasp and I am FREAKING out.  I just need to get rid of one more of the bad aspects and get on the ball of a couple of others, and I will be and have everything that I wanted or needed.  Yes folks, I know what's the problem.  There really is none, I just guess I have issues with everything going so well, I am waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Then there is the part of me that actually trys to make the shoe drop so at least I won't have to worry about it anymore.  Am I one of those people that has to have major issues in their life just to pacify themselves with the thought that ""Oh, I knew something would get fucked up"".  I would hate to think that.  I don't like people like that, drama-queens/kings.  Meh.   I just really need to chill the fuck out and focus this seemingly abundant energy on the things that REALLY matter to me.  And I need to stop being so fucking scared that I am going to lose him, he has done everything possible to show me that he isn't going anywhere, so I just need to stop looking for hidden signals that things are going wrong and just give myself permission to be happy.  ARGH!!!!!!!  

Postscriptum:  Sorry for the insanity, but I did promise someone that I would start updating more frequently and this is what has been on my mind for the past few days . . ."

"event","Okay, don't quote me on this, but, I think I might have just seen a little bit of sunlight.  I'm not sure, mind you, it could have been headlights from a passing vehicle, but from what I remember it definately looked like sunlight.  I am probably off my rocker from too much time in the dungeon.  Did anyone else see it?  If my camera was working, I would have posted a photo, but you all would have treated it like those of the Loch Ness Monster or Big Foot.  Oh well, maybe it is just time to lay off the drugs.  I am obviously losing it.   Heh, sunlight, I am off my rocker for sure."

"event","Okay, so I haven't posted in like a millenia or so.  Yeah I suck a little, but a lot has been going on. . .

Uhm, let's see, I moved back into the city in October, been kind of scattered ever since until now.
Was in a relationship with a wonderful man who introduced me to a wonderful community.  However, it was obvious that neither of us were the other's 'one' so he broke it off with me.  This led me to where I am at now. . .

I am actually, for the first time ever, brace yourself folks, I am IN LOVE!!!!!!   Crazy as that may seem. Veronica, the international girly-swinger, is off the market, forever.  I actually managed to find my soul-mate.  Didn't mean to, wasn't even looking for anything.  Totally out of the blue.  The only thing that has been a downside is that this person is a friend of the one who broke it off with me.  And we haven't spoken since I got together with said soul-mate.  I really don't want there to be any bad feelings, I really miss this person as a friend and confidant.

I am ecstatic in my love and in my world, and want to share it with people who would want to know.  It is the single most amazing thing that has ever happened to me.  
Mioux,

You reject traditional gender roles. However, you don't actively fight them.

I want interesting clients and lots of them.  But, I guess that will come with time.  I have only been there two weeks and I still have yet to build my own client base, so it will take patience on my part.

Thursday was all about cross-dressing.  It makes me wonder if there was something going on with the moon or something.  Every client I had and each one who called wanted to be sissified.  I think I need to start paying attention to this phenomena to see if it happens on other days with other fetishes . . .Hmm, I smell a book idea!"

I would never have it any other way.  I just wish there were more hours in a day.

"event","So folks, when we last left our heroine she was going to go run in her new trail runners.  Yeah!  Okay, so dad and I decided to go about 4.5 miles and I got blisters.  Blah, oh well.  Now they have healed, but, I HAVE A JOB!!!!!    Wooohoo.  I got hired by COAN oil in Natick as the Receptionist/Administrative Assistant.  It is a pretty good job.  I like it because I am busy constantly and the people are very nice.  It is refreshing to not go to work every morning with the feeling of dread underscored with the feeling of what did I do that I am going to get in trouble for today.  But that also means that trail running has been pushed to a weekend only sort of thing.
Things are going well.  I started work last Monday, the fourth so I get paid for the first time tomorrow.  It has been a while since I had money coming in, so this is a very good thing.  I am also psyched because Circuit City is having a sale on their CD's Thursday, Friday and Saturday. they will all be 9.99 for the grand opening of their new locatiuon, so needless to say some of my money is already allocated . . .
Not much going on in the social scene, which is driving me crazy, but I also don't have my license thing yet, so I can't drive any where anyway.  So I shall save my money and wait until I can grace the scene with my presence once more.
I have a cold.  Blah.  I haven't been sick in so long, I didn't even know what was wrong with me until my mom mentioned it.  I just thought that I was depressed, turns out that I wasn't any more depressed than normal, I was just coming down with an old fashioned, run of the mill, cold.  Thank Goddess for Puffs tissues.  They are saving my nose, which would surely be swiss cheese now if I had to use normal tissues.  As soon as my immune system is back up to its normal running stage, I am going to do a major detox/fast to PURIFY, so i can start toxifying all over again, tee hee."

We got home around 1pm and then ate some lunch and stuff and by the time I was out of the shower and everything it was 3.  Had to go out and pick up dad's new glasses, and he wanted to get some waterproof trail runners for me to go into the woods, because we both hate to run on the roads.  Then back to the house and it was like 4:30 and I just finished catching up on computer stuff and have done absolutely nothing I needed to do.

Not much else.  Can't wait to try out my new trail runners, fun in the woods with DRY feet!!!!"

"event","Well, my darlings, if you haven't heard the rumous already, let me tell you . . .

  I am moving back to Massachusetts.  I am already here, as a matter of fact.  I came to visit and then realized that I didn't want to go back to Georgia.  Not because I don't love all of my friends there and especially not because I didn't love my fabulous boyfriend, more that I wasn't doing myself any good there.  
  Yes, Craig and I broke up, but only because I need a relationship with another person right now just about as much as another hole in the head.  I still love Craig very much and talk to him almost every day, but I need to work on another relationship that is a lot more important.  The relationship I need to have with myself and my relationship with the powers that be in my life.  
  For the last 15 years or so, I have been in one relationship or another.  I have not been single even once.  Because of this, I have been constantly living for someone else.  I found, when I arrived in MA, that I really didn't have that great a grasp on who I actually was.  I couldn't even figure out what I actually liked or wanted, because I had spent so much of my life living for others.  Not good.  I am not even really sure how or why so many people dated me, because I couldn't have been that great of a girlfriend, if I didn't even have that great of a relationship with myself.   But alas, that is where I stand.
  I am going to be living with my parents until I get enough money saved to rent a small apartment nearby, all the while nurturing my relationship with myself and my family and getting on the path of what I really want to do.
  I am always going to be a work in progress, we all are, but it would help if I knew who that work was.  So, as cliche as it sounds, I have left to find myself.  
  Now for a less deep update . . .
  Ok, so the state of GA has totally fucked up my ability to get my license renewed, because of some trouble that happened four years ago that they never told me about or sent me anything or anything like that.  It turns out that I have been driving on a suspended license for the last FOUR years.  And no one told me, not even when I got pulled over 3 times.  And now I am trying to get a document from Robins AFB to try and clear up the confusion, and they are totally dicking me over and not sending it.  I need to get a JOB, people, and although getting a job doesn't completely hinge on me having a valid drivers license, it sure as shit would help.
  So I am helping around the house with my Mom and Dad and my little brother and sister, it is cool.  At first I thought it was going to be really weird moving back home whilst I get on my feet, being that I am 30 and all, but it really isn't that weird.  And every one is being really cool and supportive and all, so it's good.  They TOTALLY acknowledge my need to regroup and put myself back together.  I guess that it also helps that they aren't that much older than me.  They also know how much I have been through, and have told me that for their own piece of mind, they rather I be here to go through all of this.  
  I have been walking (REALLY fast) 4 miles everyday with my dad and the dog Freddie (my dad named him after Freddie Mercury).  I am about to start up yoga again and doing a whole bunch of other stuff as well.  It's good.  I am trying to put my resume together again for the first time in like 7 years, and that is rather hard and annoying, but I have found a number of helpful references online and in print form.  I am going to finish it tonight and start job hunting tomorrow with some help from my mom's closet, because I originally came up here to visit, not stay.  All I have for clothing are jeans and T-shirts, not exactly interview wear.
  One of the other reasons I decided to move back here was that my aunt died not so long ago, and then my cousin died.  My aunt was in her 30's, but it was terminal cancer.  My cousin was in his 50's and it was a heart attack.  My grandmother has had a stroke and surgery and stuff and she is in a wheelchair or with a walker, and all this stuff made me realize that you really can't take family for granted, because they die, or get damaged.  So I figured for my own piece of mind, I ought to live as close as I can in order to be here to help and to spend time, and all that.
  Okay this entry is turning into a megalong one, so I will end it here . . ."

Yeah, ""we have to let you go, because even though we know you probably didn't do what she said you did, if she starts to talk people won't be able to trust the bartenders here, blah, blah, blah""  I think there was an alternative motive, but I can't prove my theory, so whatever.  And this customer is one who REPEATEDLY walks out on her tab and only comes back to pay it sometimes.  It is very possibly the stupidist thing I have ever delt with besides the mlitary.  I have never been fired before.  It really makes you feel worthless, even if it wasn't your fault, but the fact that you would be fired for something like that makes you feel pretty inconsequential.  SO let's take stock, shall we?  The military still hasn't gotten me my orders (It's been 10 days now for those who are counting), One of my favorite cousins died (he was only 42), and I lost my job at Liz's.  All this among several other minor things, and I am just ready to curl up in a ball with a bottle of Tequila and not exist anymore.  And would everyone please stop trying to cheer me up.  I appreciate the sentiment, but I will be happy again at some point, just not right now.    ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH"

"event","Okay, we all know that the government for the most part is relatively fucked, right?  But why are they doing this to me.  I was supposed to be discharged early last week, and now I have been waiting 9, yes count them - 9, days for my discharge orders.  Why, if they can discharge someone in 48 hours, do I have to wait this long.  I am on pause.  It is fucking ridiculous.  I have never delt with something so incredibly stupid in my entire life.  This has been the biggest waste of time, I have ever encountered in my life, and to top it all off, I can't even call anyone to try and find out what the hold up is, because one of my superiors has already told me that I need to stop bothering people because they have more important things to do.  I ask you, kind LJ folks, how hard is it to sign something and transport it to another office on the base???  They could even fax it, but Noooooooooooo, they have not.  I have never been so frustrated, I fucking hate this more than anything I have experienced yet.  Those of you who know me, know that I only joined the military for school, and then they started screwing me over this year, and I got in a whole mess o trouble, and now they are supposed to be discharging me.  What's a girl gotta do to speed shit up around here?  All this ends up doing, is stop me from interviewing for much more desirable jobs and to have to work doubles to get the shifts at the one other job I did get so far.  So now from 6 am this morning to 3 am Saturday morning, I will have approximately 2-3 hours of sleep in between bartending and coming into this hell-hole.  If you are bored come visit me at Liz Reed's Music Hall on Cherry St. in Macon, GA.  I will be there from 5pm to 2am today, Thurs. and Fri.  Bring me some happiness and some thing to soothe my frustrated soul.  On a good note, it is Metal-Fest this Friday, so much fun will be had by all!!!  On a bad note, I found out yesterday that my super-cool cousin died on Monday.  Blah."

"event","I am so bored, I can't stand it.  I don't feel like updating about the weekend, because all I did was get waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too drunk and fight with Craig.  He is still upset with me, and actually all in all I am pretty fucking upset with myself.  I cannot believe that after all of these years I would even let my self go down that path again.  I was doing so well, I don't know what got into me, because it just isn't like me.  I am in love with Craig without a shadow of a doubt, and yet because of the abuse I have suffered for the last five years with Scott, I am trying to get Craig to reenact that so that I can feel like my life is 'normal'.

HOW FUCKING STUPID IS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I really don't know what the hell is wrong with me.  I feel like there are things that I want to do, but I can't figure out if I want to do them because I have been conditioned to believe that they are what I want to do, or if I ACTUALLY want to do them.  I am having a real hard time figuring out what is really me, and what is AF and Scott damage-baggage.  Maybe I need to go and spend an extended amount of time with myself.  I was entertaining the thought of staying in NH for longer when the artist and I go up there in August.  Let him get back to his deadlines, and I just stay up there and try to figure out what the fuck is going on in my head.  THat is what I did last time I felt like this, even though that was perhaps 11 years ago.

Not sure what to do, but I definately need to watch my drinking, I am doing WAAAAAAAAAAY too much of it too often.  I think it is time to cut hard liquor out of my diet again.  Stick to wine and beer and cider.  The last time I had to do that was about 11 years ago as well.  I know life is never easy and for the most part it is pretty painful, but how come I am this 'supposedly'  emotionally stable person, yet I feel as if I have lost every grasp of internal reality that I knew of. 

I know that I will feel a little more stable once the AF thing is over with.  It is sucking a little more of my soul away every day.

Just to make the post longer . . .on a positive note, the band met for the first time last night.  Mostly we discussed band names and musical concepts so taht we could all be on the same page.  My favourite band name that anyone has come up with so far is 'The Been Dones'  but that is awfully close to one of my Godson's names: Ben Dunn.  SO I do not think that they are going to go for it.  It actually came out as we were discussing band names, and they went on a run where everything the said had already been done by someone else, so . . ."

YAY!

Not, new NEW.
But newer than what i did drive.

It's a navy blue 2002 Toyota Celica.
It's has 85K miles and it was owned by a grandmother. :D
You can't get better than that.

I'm just gonna rub it in becuase I know Angela loves Celicas. ^^
D does too, he body chucked the car out of love just the other day, it was fun to watch. :D"

I NEVER UPDATE!

I know, I'm a genious.

Well, whatever, nothing much to say.
..................................................
I joined the track team, I'm President of both Drama AND Anime club. (Wow, I know.), School sucks, D-sama is still hot, I have a un-natural addiction to hard liquor, I'm being paid 200 bucks a week part-time, and I spent most of my summer up in New York having a great time with Angela, Dominick, and Nikki.

And well, I heard so much about my stalker Sandy-chan. But alas...she was away the entire time.
I hope she likes what I got her as a small gift. &gt;.&gt;;;;


That's all folks.

Anyways I thought I'd share one of them. XD

Sosuke: AYA-SAMA you sexy beast! X3

Sosuke: Are you saying that your ugly?
Aya: .............
Angela: I kid, I kid. XD
Sosuke: Hey, I've got a question for the two of ya.
Aya: yeah?
Angela: what?
Sosuke: Don't you think it's weird for people to just convert to be gay/les/bi so easily?
Sosuke: I mean, there are so many in my school and I think it's a trend. 0__o;;
Angela: Yuck, it's the same at my school. I think it's really just a trend and most people are doing it just to be noticed. Bastards.
Aya: You stole my words. XP
Sosuke: What was the case with D-sama? He was straight before going out with Aya.
Aya: Well...it must have been hidden or Dorment gayness. Cuz he kisses good. X3
Angela: I think the poor guy's been in Gay deniel all these years. XD
Sosuke: Hey, isn't that mean Angie?
Angela: I'm assumeing you haven't SEEN the two of them together.
Angela: Domi-kun and Aya are....PERFECT! XD
Sosuke: I haven't seen D-sama in years!How would I know? BTW, how long is his hair?
Aya: LONG
Sosuke: how long? X3
Aya: Umm.....not sure exactly...but I'd guess it's about 1 foot shorter then he is? 
Aya: when it's straightened.
Sosuke: How tall is D-sama?
Aya: 5'8'
Sosuke: Damn! He's tall. 
Angela: Aya's taller you know.
Sosuke: WHAT? I always pictured Aya to be the shorter of the two. XP
Aya: I'm not much taller...like half a inch?
Angela: they're the same size. XD
Sosuke: How tall is Angie?
Angela: ..................................
Aya: 5'3'
Angela: I'm 5'3' and a HALF thank you very much!
Angela: by the way, I thought D-kun was spending your Birthday with you? is he around?
Aya: he is.
Sosuke: did he bring his Laptop?
Aya: he did.
Sosuke: why isn't he online?
Aya: he's asleep
Angela: Well go wake up ""Sleeping Bastard""! *wink wink*
Sosuke: XD
Aya: no. 
Angela: awwww, scared?
Aya: YES
Sosuke: why are you scared to go kiss him?
Aya: I ain't scared to do that!
Aya: I'm just scared to wake him up period. 0__o;;;
Angela: Why? D-kun normally doesn't care if we wake him up.
Aya: yeah, but he gave me a death glare when I woke him up earlier on Sandy's behalf. 0__o;;
Angela: Sandy...WHO?
Sosuke: Sandy? Are you cheating on D-sama?!
Aya: Ummm...Don't know, but she she she was Taishi's clone. XD
Aya: and NO I'M NOT!!!
Sosuke: That's a shocker! Tai has a clone. XD
Angela: Sandy's the only OFFICIAL clone. I dubbed it upon her myself. ^^
Sosuke: What an honor!
Aya: XD
Angela: So you spoke with Sandy?
Aya: for a while...then there was a power surge. 0__o;;
Sosuke: ewwwww
Aya: I know! it ruined the popcorn I was popping! it's only half done!!!!
Angela: the poor unfinished popcorn... ;__;
Aya: I thought you couldn't eat popcorn with your braces?
Angela: *sniff* *sniff* *hic* *sniff*
Sosuke: You at what you did Aya! 
Sosuke: awww, don't cry Angie!
Aya: I was only asking!
Angela: Hey, I gotta go,... I've got a major headache....
Aya: I'm sorry. T.T
Sosuke: I hope you get better Angie
Angela: I won't, the headaches always come back. >.<;;

"event","Well...I'll come up with a breif update on how my life's been since my last public update.

I've been really busy. I've gotten two different jobs. I'm just trying to hurry up and make a few thousand dollars. 
Altogether, I'm making about 300 hundred dollars a week. Not bad...not bad. Tis a shame I can't be a worka-holic like Dominick is. Damn, and I thought he was crazy before. He just had just recovered the flu. Yeah the flu, but it was somewhat life-treatening in his case. 0__o; Had about a billion people worried sick about him. Not suprising that he didn't seem to care. XP

But hmm. I was at a wild college party last week with Dominick. The two of us got soooo wasted! XD
It was fucking hilarious! 
Well....truth be told...I was probuly more drunk then he was. D-kun was really doing the smart thing and watching his health while at the party. I could never do that. >.<;;; He just settled for wine.....just enought to make the poor guy drunk. XD  W00t! Me? ....Vodka... wooowooo. I hate beer. The taste disgusts me. But the two of us left the party early anyway. We <b>walked</b> back to my house. Cuz we are smart that way. XD Then we walked to the mall an hour or so later. We went shopping in all our drunken glory. XD ....well...my drunken glory. Man, how the hell can D-kun become sober in just a little while is way beyond me. 0__o;;

Speaking of which, D-kun is so niiiicccce. He absolutley refused to let me buy him anything, and yet he goes off and buys me a shit-load of stuff. 

He bought me these really nice bondage pants at Hot Topic. They were black with purple belts across the knee area. And he got me this awesome Star Wars belt in there as well. Just cus we're complete geeks on the inside. XD 

But dispute his protesting, I went and bought the guy some shoes anyway.  It's a real shocker that D-kun doesn't own any Converses. The origanal design I mean. So I bought him a pair....Then he told me that he would buy another pair for me. Gah! I took the box from him and paid for them both. He wasn't to happy about it, but I didn't seem to care at the time. 

But he ended up SIGNING my shoes when we went home that day. He drew these little random designs on them too. Sure I signed his shoes too....but I can't draw at all. -.-;;; There is a very nice black smug on his left converse shoe. XD
I guess he felt much better about it after he threw it at me. XP

~~~~~~~~

My oldest sister Aura is getting married soon!
She was offically engaged on Oct. 18th. Yeah! I'm so happy for her! And Brice is really nice as well. ^^
My father came back to our house shortly afterwards.  Strange though. He seems to adore Aura and Mint. But could care less about me or my twin sister. -.-;; I don't care at all. He's still here as well. 

~~~ 
So my mother finally decided to tell my dad that Rue is a lesbian and that I'm Bisexual. 
It was quite funny. XD

""Why the hell is something always wrong with the TWINS?! I knew this would happen the second they were able to talk!""

AAAHHH HaaaHaaaa! DAMN!

He ended up meeting Ayume.(Rue's GF) and well...my dad ALREADY knows D-kun, but he isn't here anymore. He's back home. 

~~~~~~

So I hate my hair right now. it's growing much to fast for me. My black roots are already showing up, ALOT. it starting to make me mad. A lot of it is showing. grrr... My bangs are really long, They are all in my face! So I ended up pulling them back for the past few days with hairpins. Yes hairpins. They were black ones. But apparently it was amusng to Rue and Ayume. I think they were the only ones who really cared...or were willing to say something about it. 0__o;;

I don't think I'll ever dye my hair this way again. It's making me real mad. I think I might just dye all of it back to black this weekend. Then maybe go back to dying my tips purple, the way I used to have it. 

~Cus that was hot and all of you know it. XD"

......

Anyways, Angie's B-day ish coming up. I hear Loney's is too. Damn. X.X;;
I got yelled at the other day...So I'm a little scared to call Angela back as of right now. >.>;;

And well... I got fired from my job....as well. T.T
Apparently my boss, Mr. Pain. (Yes...that's his real name. @.@) saw me ""Womanizing"" the other day during work. -.-;;;
So..I was fired about 3 days ago...-.-;;
As if! Why the hell would I be womanizing if I have D-kun? Can't a guy be nice to <b>all</b> his customers?!
Awww, damn...I really liked working at the Ice skating ring. -.-;;
Hmmmmm...Well now I'm totally jobless. *cry*
Hmmmmm....Where to work next? Man it's been a while since I've been job hunting.
I ain't working at some greasey fast food joint ether! Blech! I was horrified when I decided to tag along with D-kun when he went to work at McDonald's. @.@;; Thank god I made him quit that job. The very sight of the crud would make anyone sick. That couldn't have been good for him...or me...guess what I ended up eatting before I entered the place. -.-;;
Even if he was making $8.50 an hour....which is indeed a lot...I must admit... >.<
More then what I made... 0__o;;
Wheee, D-kun's now working at WardenBook's....that store kicks ass! 
Even though D-kun wasn't 18...he still got the job....He gets to handle all the ""Adult-rated"" books. XD

.........
So I saw Mr.Pain today...XD
For some odd reason all these little boys were all hanging around him... 0__o;;
It was kinda creepy...I know none of them were his kids...considering I go to the same school with a few of his daughters....Man does he have a lot of daughters. >.>;; Damn are they Clingy...to me...damn... 0__o;; 
But anyways...I never did like working for him. >.<;;

Hmmm...oh yeah...And it's offical.
I'm rooming with my sister this coming November.
I'll be living life in Texas! Wheee! Only 300 miles away from my D-kun! ^^;;
Hehehe...about this time I won't end up dehydrating again. 0__o;;

How's that for an update? XD

PS) Yeah...My profile...hmmm, I've been sick for so long that I forgot where I stuck all my files. >.<
I'll have my matching Fai layout up soon....hopefully...Kay my little Taishi?"

I was suppose to have started school last Monday. XD
But my offical first day was on Friday.... So yeah.
My sis Rue is living with us again, I hate it here. My other older sister is considering letting me move with her. Yes!, <b>that's</b> the sister I love. ^^
My mother decided that I could have my hair any way I feel like it. That makes me happy, but I wish she said that before... Oh well, My hair is growing back pretty fast, it'll be shoulder-lenght again in no time. ^^

OH! and I dyed my hair as well! YEAH! I went against Angela's Wishes and dyed my hair blonde! X3
Not all of it...just most of it. Yeah yeah....I suppose having blonde hair puts me a bit closer to looking like my father. DAMN MY NATURAL BLUE EYES!!!! Ahhh, I'm getting color contacts soon so my disgusting eyes will be a different color. I was thinking Brown or Hazel...<b>wait</b>! or I could decide on getting dark Grey eyes like D-kun's! YES! His eyes are such a sexy grey color! X3
Wait..I never said anything about what my hair looks like. XD
I dyed the top of my head completely blonde and also the under parts of my hair were dyed blonde. So everything in between that is still black. I really do like the way my bangs turned out. Most of them remained black, but then layers on top of that are blonde, it's looks awesome! X3 I shall have pictures up soon! ...maybe, depends on weither or not my mother lets me put anymore pics on the Interenet. -.-

But yeah, I'm really hoping Mint does let me live with her. The fact that she is moving to Texas also makes me want to go with her even more. (why? Hmmmm, must I really say? XD) She's going to college down there. But she doesn't start until December...I'll just keep bugging her. I know she loves me though. =^^= (Who doesn't love me?! ....Just kidding! XP) It all depends on my mother as well so...

Contacts...damn I'm just repeating myself. XP
I think I might go with the Brown though. *nodds*"

Not cool one bit.
I like it here.
Errrr..........

....but D-kun was drugged out again yesterday. XD
Hmmm....interesting....But he acted more dead then <i><b>happy</b></i>. 0.o

He ended up <b>dropping</b> his MAC about 4 times while we were out for ice cream. XP

But he recovered from the medication much faster then last time. (XD)

OH! more news! Tina decided to have her hair cut today. Since we're all cheap bastards, I'm going to be cutting her hair. ^^ I'm also going to be helping Dominick get a straight perm today. 

Wheee!

Hmmm...I'll be cutting Tina's hair to about her shoulders and D-kun's getting a perm that will most likely have his hair past his ass....

Hahahaha....That'll be a sight! The son having <i><b>much</b></i> longer hair then his mother? XD (Considering right now, their hair is about the same length)

OH! some more news! Rue is planning on living with me and my mother again before school starts again.
I guess the bitch couldn't handle living with our slutty father anymore. XD
hahaha...but I heard that Rue has a mohawk now. 0__o
There is <b>no fucking way</b> I am going to cut my hair again to match her mohawk. 0__o
I'd sooner die then have my mother cut my hair <i><b>that</b></i> short. -.-

But anyways....Boo...to having to leave D-kun's house soon. -.-"

"event","Hmmm...A lot has happened after returning back to Dominick's house.
It was a awesome trip though. Perhaps I'll get into more detail in a later entry.

But Dominick just recently found out that he has a heart hummer.... -.-
I nearly died after hearing the news. But D-kun doesn't even seem to care. 
I suppose hearing something like that doesn't suprise him anymore. I find that to extremely abnormal.
But yeah...after coming home he had to go to the docter's and have another checkup...that's when they found out. 
But the freaky thing is that he doesn't even <i>look</i> like he has such a deadly malfunction. *blink*
He look's so healthy that's it's amazing! (Do you realize how rare that is?!)

Grrrr.....damnit. 
And for a while...we couldn't even find Dominick's mother.
Considering that she didn't have her cell phone with her...D-kun's been extremly pissed about that to. 
Turns out that Tina was in the hospital. (The doctors called his house) In the <b>same</b> hospital that Dominick had to go to a few days ago for a checkup.

God Damnit.... If I wasn't holding him back, D-kun would have ended up killing some of the people in the service department....

Just goes to show you how much Tina and Domi-kun care about each other. I think it's so sweet.

But yeah...Tina fainted of dehydration....so hopefully she'll be fine soon.

But you know....I'm starting to have regrets about not letting D-kun jump those bastards at the hospital...I mean...they all <b><i>know</b></i> him and his mother...they really should have said something while he came for his checkup.

But yeah...D-kun's Heart Hummer. God...I'd die if I heard I had one of those.
D-kun sure is brave.... 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
EDIT:

Yep....just got a call today on my Cell.
Yeah...it was Heather...you know...my Ex-Girlfriend?
Yeah...but anyways, she was all whiney and in <i>other</i> words...begging to get back with me. 
I found it amusing, considering I put my phone to Dominick's ear...and made him listen to every word of it. 
(I had the volume up so I could hear too. =^^=)

It was so funny! The faces that D-kun made was funny...I mean. XD
After all the talk about her loving my new ""Hot Topic"" style and ""never going to do it again"" shit. 
Dominick paused and said....

""Back off you dirty slut, if you really liked him you wouldn't have dumped him and made him a mess. So in other words, stop calling his damn phone you bitch. He's <b><i>mine</i></b>.""

Then I heard Heather screaming...

""What? Who the hell is this?! 'He's mine' ....Wait...Your voice! ...Dominick?!""

Then D-kun hung up and went to make dinner. >.>

Ahhh haa...I've never felt so loved. (Nor have I laughed that hard in a long time.) *glomps D-kun*"

"event","Today, I decided to go to the hospital with Dominick.
...for he had a monthly appointment to go today..at 8am.... 8am!
Oh well....But it was fairly interesting.

Mrs. Maxwell (D-kun's mother) said that Dominick would not be himself because they put him on some medication and drugs everytime he has to go to the hospital. I don't remeber what she said they were called though...Hmmm...

But however...she <b>warned</b> ....Yeah...I had no idea what she meant by that at the time...

So anyway, He returned from the docter about 11am, and we headed home.
I stared at D-kun...and nothing seemed wrong to me...that is until we headed outside...

Dominick's face suddenly dropped and he started walking around as if he was drunk....
And then he started talking about how he loved everything...That's completely against his nature!
He ran over to the car and started...<b><i>hugging</i></b> it....hugging <B>my</b> car none the less!
I had to pry him away from the driver seat.....no way I was going to let him drive... 0.o

I just found it fairly amusing.
Then we got back to his house...D-kun hopped of and started to head for the biggest catus I've <b>ever</b> seen.
I thought it was cute...then he started ranting about loved <i>that</i> catus...which...hurt but that didn't matter a bit.
I ran over and pushed him aside...away from the catus then he grabbed on to me and started ranting about how much he loved me.

Of coarse...I was flattered by his whole speech and the fact that he didn't let go of me...but....
but then I slapped him across the face and dragged him into the house.
Sure it was nice...but the Dominick I grew to love would <b>never</b> express his feelings so openly like that so I made him cut it out. ^^ I blame the medication. XD

So now he is passed out on his bed as I am typing this...hohohoho....I just finished braiding his hair! X3
He looks like a Sexy realistic version of Duo Maxwell from Gundam Wing!
Hahahahaha! I wonder if he'll be back to normal when he wakes up....

If...so ....I wonder if I'm screwed...? XP"

I did But She wasn't well at all.

She was crying her eyes out, I couldn't see anything of coarse...but I could sure hear it on the phone.

Well, it was very suprising for me, I've know her all my life and I've never heard her cry before...She's really good at hiding these kind of emotiions around other people...

Before I was even remotly close to trying to make her feel any better, my mother screamed at me to help her with her work and get off the phone.

Then Angela told me that she wouldn't be online for a month or two...and for me not to call her for a while.
And aside from that, she refused to tell me anything at all.

....She also told me not to worry about it.
Well, now I'm worried! I might just have to deregard what she said and call her again! maybe tommorrow...

But it takes a lot to get someone like my Angela to cry.
I'm sure it has something to do with her Father....it normally does.
I'll get her to crack...Hopefully. 

Well, that's all...Maybe someone else should try calling her...because she apparently didn't want me.... -.-"

Apparently he IS moving again, as we all thought. He needs to be transfered to a better hospital, and his eyes have once again turned into a brownish grey. I'm pretty sure he's been on the internet recently as well. (All you CHECK your E-mails, etc.)

The two of us got into a huge fist fight at school...now that i think about it...it's really horrible. (a bro and sis don't fight in SCHOOL!)   The two of us are really drifting apart.  The only reason i survived this long without My Angie and Domi-kun was because Rue was always there for me....
Oh, but don't get me wrong...I have nothing against Goths in general.  She has really changed...I didn't really notice at first...Damn. I feel so rejected right now.  My mom doesn't seem to mind.  
But now everyone is calling us the ""twin of light and the twin of dark"" It is starting to get very annoying! Rue even went so far as to CALL ME GAY! Dude I'm not GAY! Rue is also spreading false rumors about me in school, saying that I had love affairs with other guys. She really needs to stop talking Bullshit about me. Man, I never knew my sister would stoop so low...
And yesterday she went and took the friendship bracelet me, Dominick and Angie had made in the 2nd grade and threw it out in our weed infested backyard! SHE DRIVING ME INSANE! I had spend 3 FUCKING HOURS searching for that bracelet!  I'm so sorry about the language... I'm really upset."

I'm never bored...Only Taishi-sempai is always bored ^^
Well, Today I tripped.... Taishi's clutzyness is rubbing on to me! AHH!
*runs around screaming*
I'm okay.
Today...My sister stole my clothes again...What I really want to know is why won't she ever wear her own damn clothes?! She is always wearing my clothes.  My mom is contanly telling her to waer her skirts and such... But Rue is SUCH a tom-boy...it never works... *sigh*
I'm telling ya...If I look well in a skirt, then Rue would look a lot better, considering that we are twins and she has long hair. ^^
I tell Tai that she would look good in a skirt to, man she needs to be a bit more girly...she would look a lot cuter. ^^
I'm not giving away any hints now Tai. >.<"

"event","Well anyway, the field trip went well yesterday ^.^ The ride didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would; I spent most of the time trying to explain the story of Vampire Game to some friends.... lol Duzell confused them very much ^_^;;; Like, how he's a reincarnated vampire king, who comes back as a kitty cat, who can transform to look like someone else, and if that person he changes into is a woman, he stil has the body of a man.... XD lol ah, the sexual confusion is just toooooo funny in the manga.... Dude, it's just wonderful.... usually I totally abhor guy x guy or girl x girl pairings in anime (in life as well >_>), but it's too funny in VG! 

Anyway, I was talking about the trip, now, wasn't I? Damn, I gotta quit rambling. and damn, I gotta quit cursing. When we got to the zoo, I found my good friends Emmali and Sean, so our group was a nice size, and pretty crazy if I do say so myself. So, it was Emmali, Sean, Josh (FF10 Tidus), and me, running around the zoo all crazy like. When the camera gets developed, I'll scan pictures ^.^ lol it's the same camera that I used to take a pic of my InuYasha bag, so I can't wait for ya'll to see all the photos! ^__^ Our favorite animals at the zoo were the pandas... lol but really only because Sean was so obsessed with them XD lol ah man, he cracks me up as much as J.... I mean, one time, a bug landed on his arm, so he screamed in surprise; lol! It was a high-pitched girly scream... we'll poke fun at him for it for a long time, or at least I will. It was freakin' hilarious. XD

The DSL man came yesterday as well! ^____^ But, my computer is still acting up; turns out a whole lot of spyware and crap was on our comp, so we're working on getting rid of it all, and updating our virus-ware, firewalls, and whatnot.... I hope my computer gets well soon! T__T *hugs monitor*... good thing it's not contagious. lmao.

Science fair projects are due Friday! I better get to work @__@. damn. So, I better get going. See ya'll later, and have a spaztastic day! ^__^

**uhm... I'm running on a tight schedule right now... so.... I PROMISE I'll post up some random pics next time!! ^__^;;; hey, when my cam gets back to me, I'll treat ya'll with TONS of pics!**"

SUBJECT: THE SHACK

</pre>
I'm planning on making a ""Writing Cabin."" The only thing is I'm debating on where to build it. If I build it in the woods it will act as a ""true excape"" on the other hand if I build it in my mothers back yard ""The Man"" will ask less questions. There are a few features I plan on adding to this cabin. I hope to have a desk and bookcase in the main portion of it. That is the ""Writing"" part of it. However, I also plan on adding a loft section with a bed that I can access if I feel like sleeping in my cabin. Some other things I would like to add to it are:

A Fire Pit
A Mini Fridge & Microwave (if I have power)
A few other things that may come later...

Later,
Van Tsepesh"

SUBJECT:  RESEARCH
DATE:     MARCH 3, 2009

   Research is the one thing that everyone needs to be good at. What I mean by this is that no matter what you want to do you must start with research. If you want to write a book you must start by developing your character but that will only help you so much. It is the research you put into the technology and style of the setting of your story that will make it come to life for all that will read it. This said I am currently researching life in medieval cities and villages along with mythology. All this is going into the background of a story I'm working on. I use the term story because it is going to start as a book but I also hope it helps me in making the plot for a video game.

   You all need to start your own projects with research no matter what. If you plan on making the local bridge a little nicer to look at then you should research current events and moods of people in that area. Don't just write your name or a big FUCK YOU on there. Make a statement. Show the evolutionary chart of man only evolve a politician in your area. In the end the work you put into your project will more than pay off."

"event","Never have I wanted to use that saying as bad as I do today. For a little over a week I have been planning and piloting to do a great task for the betterment of the citizens of a local town. Now that entire event has be flushed down the fucking pot by some little punk bitch mother fucking person in said town. Okay lets tell the short version of the story:

A little while back I was told how to hack the large light up signs that people use to warn you about thing like road work or heavy traffic etc. such as one that you always see in the near by town I told you about. Well when I was told about this the example that was used was ""Warning Zombies Ahead!"" Being me I could not copy the work of another and would not display a fucking retard saying such as that anyway. So I began thinking of what great saying would not only enlighten the citizens and visitors but also travel with them all the way to their grave. I was almost ready and I was going to do some final prep work today and do it tomorrow but now the worst thing in the world has happened...SOME OTHER MOTHER FUCKER BEAT ME TO IT...This would not fucking piss me off near as much if they had only put something meaningful on it but what did the lazy fucking person put...""ZOMBIES AHEAD""...WHAT THE FUCK MAN if you are going to do it don't fucking copy another mother fuckers work because it has been done and is fucking old now. I mean how hard would it have been to put something a little more meaningful up like a quote or a big ""FUCK THE GOV'T"" or anything other than what someone else has already done."

However, I am planing on moving to Dothan by the end of February. The place I'm looking at is in a nice part of town and is two floors with two bedrooms and two baths. It is a bit on the expensive side, but it is just low enough for me to split the rent and have the ability to move in. I may survive on ramen until I can find a second job. 

Anyway, I promisethat you will here more on this later.

Now however I have 2 Lowe's employees trying to get me to play. One of them is your normal Lvl. 70 Rogue, and the other is just starting and needs someone other than her husband to talk to on there. So my question is should I WoW or should I not. I don't even know if VoE still plays because I know he is all about moving up in the Army and may not have the time.

Tonight if all things go to plan a number of things will happen. The biggest one is what was once two very different parts of my life are about to join together to make my life the grand/traumatic life I have always wanted. Tonight for the first time ever Van Random will meet.....My Jessica. That's right, Van VoE will miss the first chance to meet Jessica. I do so wish he was down here though. I'm not sure what all else will go down tonight but I know I have to get home and rested before 3pm so I can be at work at Lowe's from 4-9pm for family night. Anyway, I just wanted to come and post about this grand meeting. I know there is only one person who will read this that has no idea it is about to happen but I still wanted to post.

P.S.
SteVoE,
You will get to meet her your next trip home. Speaking of your next trip home...Any Idea when that will be? I think you told me once and I just don't recall."

"event","So Jess drove me to Barns and Noble last night. We grabbed some books and set down to read some to see if they are something we want to buy. Well we decide to go home and eat so while on our way back to ozark on County Rd. 20 we meet this Light Colored SUV that only has one working headlight. As it gets closer to us it gets more in our lane. Thanks to Jess getting over though it only takes out her driver side mirror. We come to a screeching halt and I look back as the other car just keeps going. (First Near Death Experience Done) At the time we didn't know what road we where on so we go down the road looking for a house with a light on to ask what road it was. We find one. I go and tell the guy who answers the door that we where in a wreck and needed to know what road it was to call the cops. Well he tells me and I pull from in front of his house to call the cops. Well I give them his address and we sit there waiting on the state troopers to get there. It was raining at this time and me and jess where not paying much attention. When there are two taps on her window from a barrel of a large hunting rifle pointed right at us. It was the owner of that house asking us if our car was broke down. I told him once more that there was a hit and run and we where waiting on the state troopers and he went back to his house.(Second Near Death Experience Done) This story just about tops all my stories that start ""So me and Van/Voe..."" However, after last night I feel that I need to pray to some god or all the gods that might be."

I know that every guy that I think is Van VoE cannot be him. However, my Van Random sightings could be him. I have not seen any recent post on LJ by Random so I take it that he has no internet at the moment which normally happens when he is down here. But lets get to a sighting...

It was Saturday Aug, 9 I don't know what time but I had just got done eating chinese in the mall. When I walked past a group of guys. One appeared to be Van Random. However I'm not sure if it was him or not. If so then I'm pissed at myself for not talking to him (though if it was him then he was with Chris and I don't really care for Chris so much so I forgive myself).
Anyway....

I will be notifying you all once I have taken the time to write of this revelation. I will be silent no longer. This will be a defining moment in my life.</p>"

1. All members of the army band have a look about them. It looked like a little army of SteVoEs...(jk VoE)
2. I found the coolest Moist Towelettes ever. They have a pic of Monk(the obsessive-compulsive detective) on one side of the package.
3. People in the south really cannot get anything right. They were going to write USA in the sky right...WRONG they ended up with ASU in the sky.

I would love to share some pics but my camera was left behind because I was rushed out the door."

"event","I have pulled many vanishing acts in the past some that lasted for days and some well over a year. I started to ask myself why the other day then my question was answered in a book I was reading in Barns&Noble it is because I'm a Gemini. A cording to the book Geminis tend to vanish for long periods of time. I started laughing like hell when I read that book thinking how right it seemed to be describing me. I then read about Virgo, Jessica's sign, and by god it was fucking dead on. I was so tempted to by this damn book so I could read about others I know. Funding however was short that night. Anyway, I must go and start preparingfor my date tonight. 

Later,

I have been wanting to start a pirate radio station for some time now.
I however have not done anything about that. Now I'm looking into doing
a legal radio station that will only cover a very small area but it is 
legal and will give me a small voice when people are near my home.

More on this will be posted if I ever get what I need to do it.

Dear Friends,

     I miss the times of the past. I miss many things about my
past however I am a changed man. I will not let myself slip back
to where I was. I do however have some things I would love to do
I have been thinking about becoming the first as far as I know
at least Van that is also a Minister. This would be a big deal to
me. Anyway, more coming soon.

Your Friend,
Philip Hagler"

"event","Okay...To start off with congrats to Van VoE who has gotten me to start playing WoW. And now on to other shit.

I am doing all around well. In school I'm making A's and B's and in life I am doing several things (not working though). Karate is going well and I am maintaining my current weight while off my diet. I also am getting ready for my favorite night of the year that is approaching fast. I will have pics from it as soon as I can.

I have started playing WoW which VR might recall another we had been around playing (Richard). I now see why he liked playing it.

This was just a short update to let you know I have not vanished again(yet that is....jk). Also if you cannot tell by the post I don't really have shit to say.

Later,
Van Tsepesh"

"event","I have a cat, or a gato as they say in spanish-land.  I'm afraid to go to sleep at night.  this cat has a weird way of showing up right when I enter or exit REM sleep, and sticks her ass near my head.  This scares the bejeezus outa me. It's not the cat.  I mean, if you don't have the mental fortitude to deal with a feline's dirt flower on a day to day basis I might have to recommend you to a few only children that I know who would love to have a SISSY.  It bugs me how vulnerable I am when I sleep.  I lay in bed all night thinking that my blankets are ample protection against the very real danger of cold and that in my bedroom, I am untouchable.  Then I get woken up by a cat's nethers.  If a semi-retarded cat can somehow negotiate my house and find me, then I'm positive that some coked up Ed McMahon and his Star Search army of no talent goons-for-hire will be able to at least find my bathroom and dip my toothbrush in the toilet.  Because I have only just recently figured this out, and this has obviously been a problem for going on 24 years (I'd say longer, but I wasn't alive, and I don't want to assume) my faith in the criminal element of my neighbors has dropped tragically.  Just when I was thinking about how spend thousands of my dollars on bad-ass security devices, my neighbors have to go and be all law abiding.  The word has NOT been spread that it is simpler to  enter my house illegally than housing the Ill internally (wtf?).  So this is to all the thieves, murderers, prostitutes, arsonists, jaywalkers, frauds, hackers, nail biters, bed wetters (wait, no), and Hindu undesirables, my stuff is lonely and needs to be liberated or in the least, kept company.  

seriously, cat asses scare me."

"event","It is Monday morning, barely, and I have a test in just under ten hours.  I have been at this for close to 10 hours already but between football, Adult Swim, Food, and the occasional nephew, I have been able to do nothing but write a live journal entry to share my studying ineptitude.  Wait a minute, I'm getting the drive back.  I've just busted through my writing block and have discovered the constant truth that studying is almost indispensable when it comes to History exams.  So I'm off to stay in school and find out exactly which decade in the first half of the 20th century was the most creative for americans and write a five page essay in my blue book for tomorrow.

Ciao,

"event","I woke this morning and I thought I was going to be okay, then I looked at the clock and saw that I was late for work.  I went back to sleep.  If God had intended for man to work he would have given us a utopian paradise for us to live in with a perfect woman that he had made especially for me, and then let me fuck it up.  I'm not saying that I'm lazy or don't enjoy my job, I just feel like that I should have a chance to fuck up my own paradise.  

     Take today for example, I thought that my bed was nice but by no means paradise, and it was fucked up by other folks.  Now how do I find justice for this.  I can't blame my supervisor because he's not a bad guy and he himself was raised before he wanted to be.  It can't be my companies fault because they got the stick sideways a long time ago and have forgotten how to look aimlessly for paradise (you can't execute the handicapped, unless you live in Texas).  I could blame myself but I don't even like apples (or talk to snakes).  My grandparents would execute me if I blamed God so my self preservation instinct says leave God out of this (reluctantly).  So by process of elimination I have to blame... I Dunno.  That's right, apathy.  Mr. Dunno will be my whipping boy.  So here's to the retarded cousin of Activism, I am hunting you down and taking my justice out of your un-sportingly stagnant hide that you're probably sitting on watching ""Dude, Where's My Car"" because you could care less where the remote control is."

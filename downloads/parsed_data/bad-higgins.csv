Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot...
...who calls you back when you hang up on him...
...who will stay awake just to watch you sleep.

Wait for the boy who kisses your forehead...
...who wants to show you off to the world when you are in your sweats...
...who holds your hand in front of his friends...
...who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup on.

Wait for the one who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares about you and how lucky he is to have you.

Wait for the one who turns to his friends and says, ""...that's her.""



GUYS


Find a girl who calls you babe or baby face instead of hott or sexy...
...who can't stand it when you hang up on her...
...who would sit there for hours looking into your eyes...

Wait for the one who doesn't care what you look like, but what's inside counts the most...
...who looks at you with the twinkle in her eyes and sometimes kisses you on the cheek instead of the lips...
...who wants to be with you in public...
...who makes you smile just by knowing she loves/likes you back.

Wait for the girl who is a constant reminder of your happiness and joy.

Wait for the girl who you give piggy back rides to in public and she still is in view of her friends, when she gets off and says to you: ""you're THE ONE for me."""

have u ever had that feeling were u dont think u are good enough? they suck. i get the feeling that no matter what i do i dont deserve the freinds i have or the freinds i have lost! maybe thats why chris is no longer my freind really ... he relized that! i feel bad for jesse me and him are getting close wich is awesome. i mean i really used to hate him but now he is better. but as for like amanda, adria , neva and them they try to stay my freind when they really might not want to... i know its probaly not true but on days like today i just cant help but feel that way. i really should stop thinking its bad for me... i need to keep busy thats why im going to the library to find another book by the author of ""perks of wallflower"" i didnt want to write it all. i need to try and participate more because when i dont i feel alone.


its on days like today when the world kicks your ass and the girl u love steps on your heart that you feel.....infinite."

"" the darkness emurges
out of dying light
the dark comes so quick i lose my sight
i hear voices screaming
voices filled with anguish and agony
nothing but darkness, yet...
forever i fall
i take a breath
but it hurts
my body feels like its being torn to shreds
damn theese voices in my head
and all they say is...
forever you fall
this is my life now 
filled with pain and hopeing for death
just like the voices 
i can feel their breath ,yet....
forever i fall
i almost love this feeling
a feeling of torture
the voices are screaming
they say my time is up
as i take my last breath
she whispers...
i love you...""

yeah
sooooooo

the H3 show was fucking amazing.. they are really really good so is that band staletto ((spelling??)) man it was a good show. but akward kindof.

i didnt stay for the party.. i wasnt up for it.. i was kinda depressed and i rathered go to nicks and just SLEEPING.. which coincedently made it worse..

""Did you ever look, did you ever see that one person,
and the subtle way that they do these things and it hurts so much?
So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze.
It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions
and to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds.
You let this one person come down in the most perfect moment.
And it breaks my heart to know the only reason you are here now is
A reminder of what I'll never have
I'll never have... I'll never..."""

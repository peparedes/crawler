"event","basically, i told Larina how i felt and how i felt i was being 'left out' because of the jillian's people. for the first half hour, she said in nice ways to deal with it, and when she told me that i knew that weekends for the jillian's people, i told her that i didn't know that. so, now she's mad because i supposedly lied to her. i really didn't want to get into a fight with her, i imed her to clear things up and it backfired. it backfired <i>majorly</i>. so now i have to sit with her in drawing and painting tomorrow and try and work it out. but, what's going to happen is she's going to get all defensive and it's going to make things much worse. i don't exactly have anyone on my side either, i'm fending for myself. she's got taylor, becky, christine, gerralynn, and mallory. so basically, i'm screwed! and for the rest of the year, unless someone takes pity on me, i'm going to be sitting home every single effing weekend on my computer."

"event","argh, it's really not good, but i think i'm getting depressed. it's because of my friends. i don't feel appreciated - i barely even feel wanted - when i'm around them. even when i'm not around them, and i call, they always ditch me or make other plans. i can't even tell them this; they'll just get defensive and not listen, and i'll wind up in an even worse situation. i don't know what to do!

they ditch me for the jillian's people constantly, and admit it when they do! it's ridiculous, and i can't deal with it anymore. the problem is that i have no way to get away from it, and it's not getting better anytime soon. i need someone who actually wants me to hang out, someone who actually cares about what i think and what i do. my friends aren't there for me, and i need someone who is. however pathetic this sounds, my online friends are there for me more than my rl friends are. and even then, they're not always there to talk to. i can't call them, i can't hang out with them. i need to move, eheh."

"event","my stupid friend. she always ditches me. this whole week! it's ridiculous, i'm like her backup friend. it's like she's saying to herself 'oh, i'll see if kristen wants to hang out, that way if someone else doesn't call i still have something to do.' and of course, someone else winds up calling and i get screwed. i even just talked to melissa, and she basically admitted it to me.
Melissa: so she ditched you again?
me: yeah
melissa: oh, that's weird, i talked to her this morning and she said that this would be the day she actually hung out with you.
i'm really upset now, i used to think she was such an awesome friend and such. at least i still have melissa, but i only hung out with her once this week. but she has been shopping for her quincinera [sp?] dress and shoes and such so she hasn't really had time. if her dad doesn't go to see her tomorrow, then we're hanging out.
anyway, i called larina around 2 to see if she wanted to hang out. she asked if i wanted to hang out at like 8:30, and she would pick me up. it's now almost 10! i tried calling her cell phone, and she didn't answer. and then i called her house. her little sister would only be home if her parents were home, and larina would either be at her house or out somewhere else with her other friends. so her sister picks up the phone, says larina isn't home and that she'll tell her to call me back. so either larina's home ignoring me, or out without me.
she's so damn nice."

so like two days ago, she ims me saying this: ""hey chick, can you hex?"" so i say yes, but i cant do any complicated stuff, and then of course i get roped into hexing her a basenji [and the damn file caused me problems of course. nothing's easy with her]. so then the next day i give it to her, and UMFG THE EYELIDS ARE A DIFFERENT COLOR. so of course i have to go back in, change them, and adopt another dog. and i get nothing for that. AND THEN. she keeps talking to me, and she tells me to look at her site. it was a little plain, so i said that she should put something at the top to make it a little more appealing. and no she can't do it herself. GUESS WHO ENDS UP DOING IT? yep, me. then she ims me today, and says, look i remodled. so i go, i say its cute, and i do whatever. then she says sign my tagboard, so i do. 

if she actually gave me credit or even imed me NOT TO GET SOMETHING, i wouldn't be as pissed. she's just so selfish. le sigh."

umfg my science teacher is boring as dust. i asked him if we were disecting anything, and he goes on and on [apparently we're the only school who disects their own mascot >..<].

"event","Yeah, so Larina and I are... WAIT STRIKE THAT. <i>were</i> mad at Nikole. It was for a good reason. But, since Nikole got her mom into it, we're not anymore. Of course, her mom doesn't care if I'm mad at Nikole, she only cares if <i>Larina</i> is mad at Nikole. Apparently, I don't count. Maybe because her mom hates me because Nikole told her mom that my mom is a heartless bitch. If I get into that, you'll be here forever and a day. 

It's not my fault Nikole never wants to get up off of her lazy ass and do something. It's not my fault she always has to get mad at only me for things both me and Larina did. It's not my fault that Nikole has no other [female] friends other than me and Larina. 

Do you know what? Everyone in my grade hates me because they think I'm a selfish, bitchy, whore because I hang out with Nikole. I've heard it come from at least 10 people's mouths. If they actually knew me, they would know that I'm not like that. They would know that Nikole hasn't made me an uptight bitch. They would know that I do care about people other than myself. 

It's not like Nikole never talks about me from behind my back. Apparently to her, I'm an annoying, embaressing bitch. Okay, so maybe I'm a little loud. So maybe I like to have fun. So maybe I like to laugh. Apparently, that's being bitchy. Right. Would a bitch care enough to bake her a cake and cupcakes for her birthday? I don't think so. Do you think Larina and I even got a thankyou for those cakes and cupcakes? No. Do you think she even complimented on the cake that me and Larina spent hours baking and decorating? No. She didn't care. I don't even know why I did it now, because I know she wouldn't do anything like that for me. Ever.

I don't understand why she has to be so mean. She makes fun of me to my face. Apparently if I don't like the same music or like the same clothes or the same hobbies or sports she does I'm not good enough. I'd like to be my own person, thankyouverymuch. It's bad enough we have <i>one</i> of her in the world."

"event","k. today just sucked major arse. 

apparently nikole can NEVER get mad at larina. but she can blame me for the things that larina does wrong, because that always makes things better -rolls eyes- supposedly i bet with andrew on how long nikole and mike's relationship will last. [k. technically i did. BUT I SAID IT WOULD LAST LONG AND THAT SHE ACTUALLY DID LIKE HIM. so there.] and i also said that she was using him to get a birthday present [that one is NOT true]

and andrew said i should die. I HEARD HIM SAY IT. and then he denied it. wtf?

AND THEN. i get picked up at larina's and my dad starts screaming at me [in front of dayna and larina, mind you] because he had been waiting out in front of larina's house for ten minutes. usually he calls when he gets there. so technically it's not my fault. technically.

then i get home and i'm crying hysterically, so i called larina because i couldn't think of anyone else to call, and of course she couldn't understand a word that i was saying until i calmed down a bit. then nikole called, apologised [even though i wasn't mad at her, i was just really upset that she was mad for something i didn't do] but i think she's still mad.

i have field hockey tomorrow; it's all running. i really don't want to go. i hope i catch whatever my brother has for just tomorrow. eugh."

But after the first half an hour, I thought I was going to pass out or throw up. I ran too much which made me nauseous. My arms were shaking. It was baaad. 

AND THEN I SLEPT OVER LARINA'S AND IT WAS ALL GOOD. xD

I found out today that I can get contacts! The eye doctor guy was really mean. eh. oh well. Tonight was fun, too, although I was excluded from everything because they were talking to Nick trying to figure out if he likes me, which was pointless. 

I'm SO EXCITED. Tomorrow we get to see Ashlee Simpson. FOR FREE. umfgumfgumfg. She goes on at 5, but we're getting there at 9:30 tomorrow. :OO I hope we get there early enough so that after the show we can meet her. I THINK NICK IS GOING TO MEET US THERE TOO. how yay!

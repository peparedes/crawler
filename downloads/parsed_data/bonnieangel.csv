"event","Okay, Lys1123, your answers to the survey you posted were interesting.  Let's see what I come up with.

My husband's cousin Tara, because I love that name.

(5) What's the way people most often mispronounce any part of your name?
People usually don't mispronounce it.  They don't say it at all because they get stumped by the spelling.  They usually pronounce my first name, Apryle (pronounced like the month), as Aprilay.  One telemarketer called it Arilay for some reason.

Jar Jar Binks and R2D2.  They're unsung heroes.

"event","AAARRRGGGHHH!  I can't believe how irritating people can be sometimes.  Go into a meeting, and they just love nothing better than to find some way to run someone else down and make themselves look better.  Like the whole blessed world revolves around their opinion, and no one else's opinion is worth anything.  I just hate how conceited and self-centered people can be.  I guess no one has heard the term DIPLOMACY!!  Guess not, or we wouldn't have so many wars in the world.  Why can't people just treat each other right?  Try it sometime, people.  You might like it!

Okay, I'm going to go away now and try not to blow my stack.

"event","Hmmmm....where do I start?  Exactly what do you write about in a journal that can be seen by GOD and everybody?  Leaves the sex life out, I guess, unless your into voyeurism.  Maybe I will have a better idea about it tomorrow.

Saw Pearl Harbor on Saturday.  Boy, am I a sap!  I almost cried at on at least 3 different occasions in that movie.  Really am a romantic at heart, I guess.  Most Libras are.  In love with love, that's us!  I don't much care for laundry, dishes, and housework, but love is alright.  

Okay, rambling now.  Better sign off before I sound really bizarre.

"event","This past weekend was huge for house music in it's hometown - the house music picnic, and West Fest where DJ Craze and Derrick Carter both killed it. The title of this mix is inspired by what these tunes do to you if you dance too close to the sub woofer. You won't be able to stand still for long while listening to this blend of fidget house, electro, breaks and dubstep - with an emphasis on BASS. Enjoy - and feel free to share with friends, post it on your profile or burn it to listen to in the car!

Sad Day For Puppets is the newest band of nu-gazers that I have gotten into. Their debut album <i>Unknown Colors</i> doesn't really break new ground. It's pop music in the vein of Ride, Chapterhouse and their Swedish counterparts Like Honey. When the band slows down the album lags a bit, although the slower tracks sound influenced by Mazzy Star. Relying on feedback, big harmonies, and Anna Eklund's vocals this album is thirteen tracks of beautiful power pop music with a <i>shoegaze aesthetic</i>. Released in late 2008, this album would have helped keep me warm all winter. Instead, it will be perfect for spring.

Top 10 Drum & Bass Tunes of the year:

1. Hazard - Killer's Don't Die - Playaz
What is there to say about this tune? Absolutely savage. The razor sharp synth, the switch halfway through, the sample. Works in any kind of upfront set. I heard this back in January and had to wait until August to get it, suffering through seven months of hearing it on every tapepack. I'M THE KILLER THAT'S WHY!
<lj-embed id=""13""/>

2. Shy FX - Bambataa (Break Remix) - Digital Soundboy
To be honest, I could do a top 10 Break tunes of 2008. The man releases so much and his productions never dip in quality. That said, I had to choose his ""Bambataa"" relick for this list because it encompasses everything a remix of a classic should have. Samples of the original tune? Check. Original bass pattern updated with thicker drums for 2008? Yep. Murderous second drop? God, yes. Make sure there are no sharp objects around you after the breakdown. Break is slowly overtaking Dillinja for best second drops in drum & bass.
<lj-embed id=""14""/>

3. DJ Fresh - Golddust - Break Beat Kaos
Ever since he left the seminal techstep group Bad Company, Fresh has had a hard time making a name for himself. For a while, he stuck to his roots making tunes like the classic ""Signal"". Around 2004 he began dabbling in jump-up and the poppy side of drum & bass. Shortly after, he signed Pendulum to his Break Beat Kaos label and tried his hand at singing over rock-influenced tunes. It didn't work. This year, he released one of the best 12"" of the year. ""Golddust"" is an electro-house influenced stomper with a quick intro that gets right to the point. The build-up on the second drop incorporates lush strings and is total hands-in-the-air bizness. The flip, ""The Field,"" is Fresh at his best with a sharp techy roller. More like this, please.
<lj-embed id=""15""/>

4. DJ Die - Flashpoint - Clear Skyz
Similar to Fresh, Die has been around since the mid-90's and throughout the early 2000's struggled to keep up with the new direction drum & bass was headed in. In the past couple years he has found his stride, going back to basics and making bangers, both by himself and with artists like Clipz, Break, Interface, and Breakbeat Era's Leonie Laws. The third release on Die's own label (named after the seminal Full Cycle tune) is Die doing what he and the rest of the Bristol crew are known for - heavy, no-nonsense jump-up rollers. There is not much I can say about this tune other than that it's pure dancefloor drum & bass.
<lj-embed id=""16""/>

5. Noisia - Stigma - Vision
If there is one set of producers you can always count on to come original, it's Noisia. Along with ""Diplodocus,"" also released this year - which may be the shortest D&B track ever at just over 3 minutes - ""Stigma"" is a combination of hard breaks and reeces that would make Ed Rush's mouth water. This tune sounds like nothing else out there.
<lj-embed id=""17""/>

6. Chase & Status feat. Takura - Streetlife - Ram Records
Another production duo that has been all over the place this year are Chase & Status. This is my favorite track off of their debut LP ""More Than Alot"" (yes, it is spelled that way which kills me). It's only fitting that this tune came out on Ram, as the bassline sounds like something Andy C and Shimon would have made back in 95. This is pop drum & bass at it's best - imitators take note.
<lj-embed id=""18""/>

7. Benga & Cokie - Night (Digital Soundboy Remix) - Digital Soundboy
There is no doubt that the number one music genre this year has been dubstep. The original version of ""Night"" is a dubstep anthem by two of the biggest names in the genre. It's only necessary that a drum & bass remix has two of the biggest names to remix it, right? Shy FX and Breakage up the tempo a bit and add a dubby bassline making this the best of the many dubstep-influenced dnb tracks of 2008.
<lj-embed id=""19""/>

8. Nu:Tone - Balaclava - Hospital
With synths sounding like they came out of a late 90's melodic trance record (think Vincent De Moor or Aztec Mystic's ""The Knights Of The Jaguar"" - which is more house, I guess, but that's beside the point), Nu:Tone comes through with a blissful roller unmatched by anything released this year. Taking obvious influence from fellow Cambridge-ites Logistics and Commix, Nu:Tone brings out one of the deepest cuts of 2008.
<lj-embed id=""20""/>

9. Apex - The Yearning VIP - Horizons Music
Brilliant drum & bass hearkening back to the days of Omni Trio. The breakdown is breathtakingly beautiful and the breaks are cut up masterfully. Not to mention the bassline, which is thick as molasses. There are no words to describe this tune, really, just take a listen.
<lj-embed id=""21""/>

10. Icicle - Spartan - Shogun Audio
It's only right for me to round out this list with the man who was pegged as ""one to watch"" for 2008 - and exceeded everyone's expectations. ""Spartan"" was a standard for any DJ who liked to go dark. With its gut-wrenching bass stabs and cut-up jungle breaks at the end of every 8th bar, ""Spartan"" epitomizes what drum & bass is all about. Released on Friction's Shogun Audio, which has the highest quality control of any label in the genre.
<lj-embed id=""22""/>

Stay tuned for more of my favorites from 2008!"

"event","This month, I have two mixes for you - one for those who like to sit around at home stroking their chins and the other for those who like to stand around at raves looking hard. Since school is starting I figured more music could only be a good thing.  The first mix blends soulful, dark and deep drum n bass/jungle before ending with some drumfunk. The second mix is a straight up rinse-out - jump-up and a bit of tech. Enjoy.

Also - I'm not on my normal PC. There is a bit of a background hum but it is only noticeable in breakdowns, hardly anything that takes away from the mixes.

"event","I wasn't actually hungover when I made this, but I had DJed for 4 1/2 hours the previous night and was sore as fuck. It's a bit different. It's pretty deep and gets dark at times. The tunes roll for a bit. ""Solitary Native"" uses a pretty familiar sample. ""Evil Twin"" was in one of my other mixes, it's disgusting. I recorded this on a whim, none of it was pre-planned and I am proud of how well it turned out.

I think it costs a little money to get in, probably no more than 10 bucks and that includes a cup for beer as well as money for myself. In addition to beer, there are mixed drinks too, if you're into that. Come out!

Hopefully I will have CDs, but if not there will be a new mix recorded and posted soon. Also, there will be free condoms for anyone planning on having sex. Even if you don't plan on having sex (really, who does? that would seem to take a lot of the fun out of it) and have sex with someone you don't know well, the condoms are for you too, obviously.

Parking is better the earlier you show up. This event will probably have a keg at it.

if someone has a camera, could you take some pictures of me? nothing ridiculous, i just want some new pixxxx to upload, considering the latest one i have of me is from last april. i'm trying to actually make my myspace something worth looking at (if such a thing is possible). oh, and if anyone has some sort of video camera and wants to take some video i would greatly appreciate it... again, not videotaping the whole 2+ hours or whatever but just a few minutes worth would be awesome.

i realize this is a shot in the dark but whatever.

i'm excited for this. i'm going to have CDs, too. it will just be the ""everybody cheer up and dance around"" mix from january and maybe a few copies of ""house party mix vol. 2"", so if you haven't gotten one yet here's your chance. if you missed vol. 1 get at me and i'll burn you one for friday."

"event","here's a collection of records i have bought over the past few months and stuff that i have been feeling. it's a good selection for fall i think. all the records are funky and deep except for the break, noisia and logistics records which are somewhat techy. all this stuff (except die's ""autumn"") is from this year so it is in my opinion a collection of some of the best records of 2006.

highlights include mist:i:cal's ""memory jog"" which is basically what a rhythim is rhymthim drum n bass remix would sound like. listen closely for a sweet ass sample, let me know if you notice it. it took me a while. total science's ""soul patrol"" features LTJ bukem's traditional MC, conrad on vocals and is quite funky. break's ""evil twin"" is incredibly dark and awesome. die & clipz's ""good old days"" is a nice jump-up roller that features a nice piano sample, and is classic full cycle stuff. you may have heard it in some of my other mixes.


so yeah i think it's mixed really well and is good for fall so check it out. this isn't like some of my other recent dnb mixes though. there are no teases or double drops or tricks i pretty much just let the records breathe and that is what is best sometimes.

"event","i have recorded my first actual mix CD and i will be giving it out to anyone who wants it. it is broken up into separate tracks (impressive, i know). i am going to be making copies for peoria this friday but at the next party i play, i will have copies. it will be somewhat of a 'release party', hopefully. if you want one i will get it to you somehow. it is free.

it is basically everything i would play at a house party. it starts out with some older club tracks, then newer stuff, then some cheesy stuff (skee-lo, john cougar) and eventually ends with a song every one likes to sing along to. it has some new blends and mixes that i haven't put on any mixes that i have uploaded to the internets.

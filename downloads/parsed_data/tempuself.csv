"event","So my coworker wants me to rip the title pages out of all these reference books and then throw them away... This kind of thing should be a crime... I mean... there are a lot of useless outdated reference books here but the majority of them still contain much to offer... I pocketed a few that I will probably never read but they are interesting and I'd rather have them on my book shelf at home than in a dumpster... This is the kind of thing that makes civilization forget things

message for Amy:
Don't be sick!... well at least I hope that your throat doesn't feel too bad and that you don't get strep... If I don't get to talk to you later then sleep well tonight and be safe...
*BIG HUGS*"

EDIT: I'm an idiot... I just read the availability thing and it's out of stock so I'll have to get it used from some guy who has a CD ROM made out of sand paper"

"event","An explosion of color and light in a room filled with smoke... the light subsides but there is just enough to see the smokey hase... no more pretty colors... just smoke... slowly it settles... I begin to make sense of things... I'm in a structure built of logs... in front of me is a door... on the wall to my left there is a small window... I look out of it now and see that the sun is half over it's horizon... but is it rising or setting?  Suddenly a second question pops into my head... <i>Who summoned me?</i>... I say it out loud but I'm not entirely sure why... now things start to become clearer... could it be true? have I been given a free ride? have I been brought to this world without any debt to repay?  But who in their right mind would summon an Elf and then leave?"

You know it's just one of those days when you wake up on the right side of the bed and you just smile. It's weird. Anyway. for those of you people that I have not spoken to in a while, Life is great!

"event","So I'm in the midst of writing this book that in a way portrays who I am, and yet the character has it's own uniqueness that isn't relevant to me. Yet, once I feel that I've grasped the character, I realize that i haven't really grasped her at all. I  mean I sit and think about who I am as a whole, and when I'm not whole, and in those circumstances what completes me, and how I see my life from the negative and positive perspectives, and why I've made the choices I have, etc. But I don't really know why. It's like once I  feel I've grasped who I am and thrown it into the character, my character is never really full. There's always something missing. I don't know how to explain it really. I just felt like writing out my thoughts instead of locking them inside my head."

"event","So it's been a while. I haven't really had anything to write aout. It was Jake's birthday a little bit ago. HE'S SO OLD! Just kidding, I love you baby. I went to Jay's house for the first time in a long time, saw a lot of people I haven't seen in ages. It was weird.... memories. I saw Danielle! I met her boyfriend, o baby! It was so good seeing her. I actually miss dance, suprisingly, and it sucks I can't be in the Nutcracker but oh well. I'm home schooling again which I like. I'm looking at colleges and all that. The whole thing kind of gives me anxiety, but in a good way I guess. Because it's also exciting, as much as it is scary. I don't know. Anyway, I'm good, things are good, Jake is really good (going on 10 months), I don't really have anything to complain about. At least not yet. For those who I haven't talked to, or haven't talked to me (Lulu), no names of course, please call me, you are deeply missed. Peace."

The whole process of eliminating diseases and things like that took a while. Not to mention the fact that it absolutely sucked! I just found out yesterday that I had a sist that burst and that is what caused the pain. I'm okay now, after hours of proding and poking in uncomfortable places. I will survive though, don't you worry. I had rehearsal today. It was whateer it was. I don't now how i took it. I hate having to go over and over and over the fucking counts of flowers. I have fucking nightmares about that shit now. Kaitlyn I'm sure you understand that one. Plus JoAnna is kind of crazy and can't remember. My knees kind of hur, but I iced them which as cold, as it should be. I just baked a cake. A really good, double chocolate one. It's my sister's birthday today, hence the reason I baked it. Yea. I was going to go listen to my sexy neeko and aaron play music, but I remembered (luckily) that it was my sis's b-day. Sorry guys I would love to hear you play. Neeko my bed is calling... Anywho. I missed Eman today she wasn't at dance. sorry I'm babbeling. I just don't want to do my homework so I am writing whatever I can think of, which is not a lot. Thank you baby for my flowers, they make my room smell really good. *hahaha nipples* (in a british/new york/scottish/hawaiin/jamaican accent... I can't seemt o ever stick with one, damn it.) Baby that was just for you, it's my way os saying thank you. And for those of you who are like wha the fuck is she talking about, I don't have a fucking clue. No I'm just kidding.

"event","So... summer has ended. This summer seemed to go by slowly, but then again I home schooled. So that was kind of like summer as well. I think of all my summers, this has been the most rewarding. I have grown, in many many ways. I was handed beautiful opportunities, that earlier in my life I could only dream about, and for that I am grateful. I made mistakes, and hit the bottom. Harder than I knew I could. I experienced pain, and felt what it's like to really dissapoint someone. But for that too I am grateful. Each day of my summer has taught me how to accept myself,a nd realize that I am only human, and mistakes are okay. A lot of my friends, I have let down. I know this. I'm sorry for it too. This summer was about me, I had to find myself. For those of you who I didn't give my attention to I am sorry. A lot of my friends have changed, a lot have gone down th road that i am backing up from. But that's their choice. In truth, some have hurt me, or suprised me more or less. People that I looked up to, and felt proud of, lost my interest because they turned into everything I was running form. I am not one to judge because it woule be unfair, and hypoctitcal. I love all o fyou, but I would be lying if I sid we were still friends. It may seem that I have let a lot of you down, like I haven't given you my time. This si true with many of you. Emmanuelle, you are one that I owe this appology to. As are a number of others. But some of you, I'm glad to be away from. I'm glad that i finally have the chance to breathe,a nd see what it's like to not constantly be inside this bubble with the rest of th eworld. A lot of you have fallen, and in your opinion it may not be a wrong, but in my opinion it is. I hope the school year is good to you all. I hope you all learn that it's okay to be yourselves, and you won't get sucked into everyone else's world. Good luck everyone. Feel free to call me, I am always around. Emmanuelle, I love you, I would never want to make you feel negelected. Lulu, thank you... for everything... you know what I'm talking about. This summer, was an amazing experience for me. When the summer first began, I had my group of people, I had this familiar zone that all had the same opinions, and the same interests. I was told to hate people I didn't even know. But I'm glad I broke free, because in the end the ones I never knew, and only judged because I was told. Were the ones who didn't change, the ones who stayed real. Kitty you are one of those people,a nd for that I have a lot of respect for you. Like I've said over and over again, this summer was great. I hope you all learned as much as me. Thanks baby for everything. I love you all. Peace."

"event","I have just returned from a wekk long trip to Mammoth with my mom. It was actually a lot of fun. We just relaxed, and read, and wrote, and ate, and bonded. As lame as that dounds. it was a great experience, we needed it. Mammoth was beautiful, it was as hot as hell but beautiful. Going to places like that kind of remind you to appreciate life, or at least that's waht happens to me. In LA we don't see that kind of natural beauty. I mean the hikes were amazing, there were huge waterfalls that you would walk by on a man made wooden bridge that was place a foot over the rushing rivers, and you would hike through the whole mountain like that. Beautiful. I'm kind of tired, adn yet excited. I have an audition today for acting. Plus I have all these new modeling pictures, because when I was in Mammoth I had a three day modeling shoot. it was such an unbelievable experiecne. I never had things like this, so being handed all these amazing opportunities is kind of mind blowing. I really hope that one day people can wake up and strt appreciating life, because right now doesn't matter. We create the things that happen around us. he only thing that matters is who become over the years. how you live everyday, or who you date, or how smart you are doesn't shape the person ou will become. That comes from the heart. Happiness is man's best medicine. We at our age like to make everything more dramatic than it needs to be, who cares if you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, who cares if no one wants to hangout with you. people need to realize that they don't need others to complete them. We have no reason to be insecure about ourselves. We all recieve the same knowlegde, we all have the ability to obtain our goals, we just need to learn to try harder. Being honest to my parents has changed me for the better. I can be myself and not have the weight of lyin gon me. I have nothing to  lie about anymore. Sometimes when you tell the truth, I don't know, I guess you here all the things you are doing outloud and you realize how stupid it sounds. I kind of got a kick in the butt. I realized that there are things tha I don't need, that will ultimatey get in my way. i am a strong determined individual, I know it. because that's who I choose to be. I am doing things for myself now. i have goals, and dreams, and passions and I am going to accomplish them and I am not going to let anything get in the way. Life is too short, ""eat desert first, adn share it."" So things have been going really well for me. We got the key to our new house on Tuesday and now we are laying the hardwood floors. Then we move in. I miss alot of people who i owe phone calls to. Jake... thank you! I'm really happy that I got to see you yesterday, i missed you a lot. One thing that happened while I was gone, was a friend of mine made a decision. One that kind of disappointed me I guess is the right word to use. In my opinion they were incredible, and talented, and differetn. I liked that about them. That's what attracted me to be their friend. But this decision, doesn't sound like them at all. I mean maybe I never knew them as well as I thought. I guess I was just really disappointed. People make decisions for yourself, not for anyone else. I'm tired of seeing people try to fit in. As long in you believe in yourself, then that'sa ll that matters. You don't need other people to like you or not like you. Please remmeber that. Peace."

Believe in yourself, because no matter what there is something about you that makes you differnt than everyone else, and that is why you are special.

But I have now locked myself in my room with my computer, my great dane, and some ice cream. Oh wait scratch the ice cream I am on a diet. Just kidding, if I was on a diet it would definitly call for some good ass ben and jerry's. Anywho. I guess i ma writing because it takes my mind off of the creepy shadows outside my window. I had a long day. But it was good. Um let's see. I have been up since six because my mom had to go to my sisters to help with the garae sale. Then I took the dogs for a walk, fed them. took a shower, talked to Jake. Then I decided I should do homework. But my computer was being lame and I kind of had a melt down. So I then decided that I wanted to see Jake, but he was taking too long so I called him to see why he was lagging. Then he came and I ate some ice cream, and stole his book that he made in class and took it into the bathroom to read. Not like that, that's gross. He tried to steel the book from me so I locked him out and the bathroom was the closest place. Then we had a jolly convo on the couch and talked abpout various things while watching re-runs of road rules. We had a good time, even though we had minor difficulties and small bickerings. No worries babe. Then my lovely friend emannuelle called and darling debra and we had a jolly talk. Then my friend jake called but he was a poop so I didn;t want to talk to him. I talked to leif and once again had to turn down the whole watching of oh fuck leif i forgot hte name of the movie, I'm letting you down. Wait, Great Expectations! that was sad, cause I do want to see that movie. Um what else. I fed the dogs yet again. Went outside where a creepy guy stood in the road and whistled to Gwendolyn. Now I am in my house writing and all, I was on a role with my homework and got a lot done. Babe you would be proud. Anyway I am done typing. bye everyone I love you. Call meif you want to hangout.

"event","Paranoid. That's one of many words I can think of when trying to describe myself. For some reason it seems to rip at every part of my insecure being. In many situations it controls me, forces me to hide behind my barrier, allows me to feel even more unwanted than I already do. I've been disappointed with my actions for a long time now. I mean my goal in life is to treat people with respect, to save lives, to be this incredible person who in some way changes the world. I think first, before I take on such a huge task, I should learn how to help those around me first. There are about a million people who I should be there for, whether they are there for me or not. But I haven't been. I've been caught up in my own shit, worrying about things that shouldn't even be questioned. So Lu, I'm sorry. I promise you, I will be there for you more. I'm sorry I haven't had the chance. M-dawg, I'm sorry that I kind of just let our friendship vanish. Us three girls have been together too long to just let that friendship disappear. Babe, I'm sorry for being difficult, which I know I am. I always hoped my actions would speak louder than my words, but for some reason they haven't. I, like many others, have a lot to learn about relationships(in general). Trust is a huge problem of mine. Over the years I have found my comfort zone, behind my wall. Where everyone is distant, and I'm safe. But I've also noticed that that wall of mine makes me loose people who I care about. I'm tired of pushing people away. So to anyone I have ever hurt, I'm sorry. I hope that the people who hate me for some apparent reason, can forgive me for whatever it is I have done. I hope that my friends, the poeple I love, can forgive me for not being there the way I should have. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Peace."

"event","So, I have a story to tell you about some rich Malibu bitch, no names needed. I went to ballet this morning and was having ajolly good time may I add. When my teacher decides to tell the class a story. Now this is a class of adults just to let you know. So she tells us this story about how one of our assignments for outreach was to go into Elm school and perform. Now Elm school is a poor school in Oxnard. I mean kids are living on the side walks or in cars, that's how bad it is. So JoAnna, my teacher, is saying we had a contest where the kids had to write essays and the two kids with the best essays would be in our performance. So she was telling us how the other night she was supposed to go and read the essays, and felt really bad that she couldn't make it. So this morning she appologized to the head of the outreach, and she said not to worry because the essaysw ere all in spanish, so they had to geta  translator. Now when JoAnna says this, this bitch goes, ""Hello, where are we? They should know how to speak english, I mean my God. Come on."" JoAnna and a number of the other women say, ""Now come on - some of these kids don't even have homes."" and do you know what she says? She says, ""Ya but still, why be ehre is they can't even speak our language. They shouldn't live here then."" and JoAnna, thank god being agood person says, ""now-that is so wrong. These children can much less afford to live and you are complaining that they can;t speak english. That's so wrong."" 

I hope you take this story as a lesson. look at the mind set of these disgusting people and do what you can to never be like them.

Peace."

"event","So I went to prom with my boyfriend Jake. It was a lot of fun for te most part. I mean there was ""drama"" and ""conflict"" but overall it was a good experience. I mean, everyone looked gorgeous. I must say. Plus it was nice to be with all my friends. The limo ride was a lot of fun. I mean I probably looked like an idiot for the most of it, but I had fun. It was nice seeing people I haven't seen for a while. I mean overall the whole prom thing is kind of ridiculous, but whatever. I it was interesting. From friday night to last night, I have just had breakdown city. I have cried I don't even know how many times in the last three days. But last night I had a huge breakdown. I even confrinted someone who I haven't talked to in a year. I just needed to get all of my frustration out I guess. Sunday I went fo a nice long walk/jog on the beach. I got tan from it which is good beacause I don't want to show up in Haqwaii as a real white girl. I also got another one of my modeling shots. I actually like it. Then I ran into Jake Slauser and Aaron Smith. They asked me to go to the movies with them so I went. It was a lot of fun, not that I had expected it to be any less. I had some good laughs with those guys. But today, or this morning, I'm okay. Aside from the whle puffy eye thing. but oh well, I can get rid of that. I guess I am just angry at myself for some choices I made last night. But I just have to realize I made them and can't change tham. Anyway, I hope you all hada  good weekend. Peace."

"event","So peoples, I am very....hmmmm...I dunno. I feel very odd. I guess. I mean, I am awake, very awake, but at the same time my head is tired. Does that make sense? Who knows. Meh. Anyway, I am happy because work was canceled today, but I am sad because I need the money. Seeing as I only have 400 of my 560 dollars needed for Hawaii. I am paying for everything myself. Then I have to make 700 dollars for new york. I am working like 5 different jobs. Tutoring here and there. Chaotic. But then again it's me going on the trips, so I am not going to make my parents pay. i hate asking them for money. If I want something I will find a way to make the money to buy it for myself. In my opinion that's the right thing to do. But whatever if your parents want to buy you shit, tight. So here I am it is 9:20 on a beautiful Wednesday morning. Last night was the first night I haven't had an anxiety attack befor falling asleep. I had some kind of crazy cool dreams. I don't really remember them, I just remember being like whoa weird. So anyway. I am basically going to be a boring person today, and do school work. But I have to get that shit done. So I am off now. I hope ya'll are having a swell day. peace, love, jesus christ superstar. Abus lover... you rock my world! Abus was fucking tight. Thank babe for my e-mail...it made my anxiety leave. I feel like a new woman, no just playin'. But it really did make me really really super happy. Love ya all."

I have worked my ass off auditioning for hundreds of agents, and now finally I have one. I have modeling shots, and headshots, and I am on a casting website where my picture and resume are posted for directors to see. I am so excited. On another note of good things that are happening to me. I am moving, my parents just bought a house. It's in Malibu Lake and it is gorgeous. It's this two story shingled house. With beautiful rooms. Its huge, well it feels huge. Plus we now have a party boat and a dock. So i can use the lake on a regular basis. WE are moving in July. Right now my mom is hiring an interior designer, and we are designing the rooms in the house so we can have work done before we move in. IOt's awesome. I am trying this new thing to which starts today. It's called being nice to everyone. It is a bit of a challenge, mainly because I have major PMS right now but oh well. Anyway. I hope you all are doing well like i am. Peace."

I have continued to exercise and stratch (even with my fucking foot) because I haven't danced for God only knows how long. I have a dance show coming up in June, I have a solo. Pretty excited, a little stressed because I am missing rehearsal. But oh well. I am tutoring another little 7th grade gilr in math now. Trying to make more money for my trip to Hawaii and New York. I already bought the tickets by myself, I just don't have money for food or shopping. Little stressed about that. But it's okay because I went to that homeopathic store by spruzzo's, you know zengi, and I got unstress drops. They work really well. My back is kind of fucked up right now, for some reason my shoulders are not even. probably not a good sing. oh well. I have my prom dress, preety cool. It's really pretty. I don't usually wear dresses, or do my nails, or shave my legs on a regular basis, or do my hair and make-up, or go to dances for that matter. But right now I alooking forward to being ""feminine"" for a night. It's good to try new things. Prom will be fun. People need to chill about the car ride though. I am very easy going, and could care lessabout hte car I ride in. It's what an hour and a half ride. Holly bajesus frickin' chill! I have an audition with an agency tomorrow, wish me luck. They saw my picture in the magazine I modeled in and liked my look. I'm trying to remain positive, sending positive vibes. But oh well. I've had a couple of good days. I hope youa ll have too. Nick I miss you! We do need ot hangout with or without the tie or bed. I love all ya'all. Hope life is treating you well. Don't sweat the small stuff. Peace."

"event","So where do I stand today. let's see, I have decided to start over. i mean start life over to be a little less broad, or maybe more. Who cares. Anyway, my foot hurts, but it is starting to scab which is good.I can finally get off my crutches and hobble around like a crippled old woman, rather sad picture now that I look back and see myself in it. I have taken a step and chose to be rather honest with certain people that I love, and honestly it was terrifying. I have learned to take one step at a time, look I'm quoting my fellow AA frinds now. Whatever, anyway. I've decided to accept things in life that I know I will never have the power to change, and that is mostly me. I have accepted my past and have left it behind as a memory. Not to sound corny or anything, but always believe in yourself, believe that you are capable of anything and everything your heart desires. I had to learn that the hard way. On that note I shall go and do more work. Peace."

I mean the doc had to give me this huge shot that huirt like a bitch, and then dig it out of the arch of my foot. He warned me it would hurt though because of all the nerves in my foot. i can't dance for a week. I hope it's only a week. I have a dance show in June. I need to rehearse. But oh well. Had a nice time with Leif and Jake, even though they cracked jpokes about me being crippled, and tried to beat me wioth my crutches. Oh well, what can you do? I am very hot rigth now. Crutching really takesa lot out of you. I am sorry I could not see Hayley yesterday, happy birthday lover! I was hit with a door today on my bad foot trying to walk into starbucks. Oh yea on my way home from work I was blasting zepplin with my windows rolled down and my trucker hat on, and I noticed someone staring at me. I mean you can tell when someone is looking at you, you know. Anyway I flipped them off and then realized it was Jack and Kelly Osbourne. Kelly rolled down her window and flipped me off and said ""I like you, you're fucking cool."" It was hilarious. Then they drove off and went to AA or something. That my friends is a true story, I did indeed flip off the osbournes. Oh well. They liked it. Well I must go lay down now. I am in pain. Peace."

"event","so I guess the last time I wrote it was after Max's party. So almost a week has gone by, and in that week pretty much nothing has happened. I mean on Monday I did my school work, like a good little child.I also had to go to the doctors. It was very tramatic. I have been having hart palpatations so I went and had the doctor check on me, and she mane me take a urine test, which by the way I have a fear of hospitals and public bathrooms, and that was like a combination of both. Then I also had to taka blood test. It was awful. You see i pretty much have non-existent veins. So the process of my blood test consists of pushing and squeezing and bleeding and crying. Not to get too into detil. It's just that a nurse might get the idea that sticking a needle into someones arem and then squeezing the vein around it, I mean it's common sense. But she didn't quite get that, so i figured the fact that I was crying would help her understand, that didn't either. I also went to dance, after about three weeks of never going. On Tuesday i went to the beach with Debra and Emmanuelle it was so fun. Well first I went to dance. Then I went to lunch with my mother and sister. Then I went to the beach with my girls. We were there from 1-4:30. It was awesome. We walked from eman's down to paradise cove where we drank pinacoladas and chatted about this and that. Then we decided to walk down to little dume. We saw many men, andnasty girls. To begin with we saw Jolla. Debra was like stop having babies, I thought that was pretty funny. I saw my boys Rye Lancaster,a nd Colbie Trivette. Then this like forty year guy was whistleing at us and I turned around to find him staring at our asses, and I was like I'm sorry did he just whistle at us. Who does that...surfers. Then we saw this guy that Emmanuelle thought was hot. He liked her too because the whole time he walked by us he was staring at her, and then he put his board down like right in front of us and started stretching. Deb and I were like eman go hit on that guy. So she did it was hilarious. The on the way back we saw ""the brother"". Sorry inside thing amongst eman, deb and I. It was a good day. Wednesday i had an anxiety attack, which caused me to do my school work. I saw jake too, it was really nice. I'm glad you understand baby. i also talked to Leifer, good talk.I needed it. Thanks Leif. I also talked to my buddy aaron smith, good times. Now it's thursday morning. I have done nothing but wake-up and eat, yes eat. I wanted to wake up at 7 but when my alarm went off I just pretended to ignore it. Oh well. Peace."

1. I saw Ben (Hartwick love) playing the guitar and decided he needed a hug, so I basically tackled him. Jolly good.
2. I then mingled and saw peopel that I have not seen for a while.
3. I was introduced to many people as well. Like Gabe, Colin, and other people (sorry I can't rememeber your names)
4. i had a good time with Emmanuelle and Anne.
5. I got to see Erica! I love her...she bit my boobs.
6. Then I got hit in the boob by a soccer ball by Leif. That was funny. (I was perfectly fine Leifer)
7. Then I saw Jason K. and he and I had a reunion. He said that he loved me and that I was cool, esp. since I am dating Jake and he owes Jkae his life. 
8. Then Max kept taking random pictures of me and people. Like kissing Jake, or Kissing Hartwick love on the cheek.
9. Then I found Allen. I helped him eat bread, and get into bed. 
10. Then my finger started bleeding, and Jason P. helped me. He washed it off and wrapped a paper towel around it. That was os nice of him.
11. Then Max showed me his nipples. It was funny. Good times.
12. Then I really needed water, and so Hartwick Love went intot he fridge to look for some and instead found whipping milk. Thanks for the effort Hartwick love.
13. Then I decided I should leave, adn so I said my farewell's and went to emmanuelle's. 

I would just like to say that today has been a good day. I had a really fun night, I got to see people I missed, and meet people I never knew (hence the meeting part), I got to have a fun night with Anne and Emmanuelle, and thent oday I got to eat pancakes, go to the beach and hangout with Jake and Emmanuelle, and then come home and make a new friend.

"event","Well, here I am yet again typing on my live joural to you fine people. But, I have nothing to say. I mean I could ramble on about how I find things to be very odd. because I have seen a lot of odd things lately that I don't yet understand, and don't dare to question. But I fear that I would bore you. I could then tell you about how small things anger me to such a great extent, but that could just scare you. So I guess all I have to say is I saw a picture today that kind of pissed me off, which it shouldn't have. I have also realized that certain relationships make me jelouse. i mean not sexual relationships, just relationships in general. I often look at some of the people I really care about and say ""my god I wish I had that kind of relationship with that person."" It makes me sad to know that the people I thought I was close too, I'm not really that close to at all. I mean I don't often share myself with my friends, as they don't with me. I mean, the people I am supposed to know the best and feel more comfortable with and truley understand, i don't. I love them, and always will. But in the end our relationships just aren'tt he way we thought they were. I mean you watch that person with someone else, someone they might be really close with and you just don't even compare. It happens to me all the time. I've kind of been feeling like shit lately. i mean I feel very alone, I don't know if that makes sense. It's not so much that I don't have anyone there for me, becase I do, it's more that inside myself I am lonely. People who I thought I would know forever have kind of left me. The people I thought I knew best I don't know at all. And this has all happened in this last year. I mean I know that hole thing about how peopel change in high school and all that, but this, this is different. I used to think so highly of these people, and now I can't remember why. So anyway, sorry for rambling. Hope everyone is having a nice day. peace."

"event","have you ever sat and wondered what your purpose on this world is. I mean, not that I am religious or anything, but people were put on this earth for a purpose...right? I mean, if each and every person was put on the earth witha certain goal that they had to acheive before the day they die, then why do children die. I was always told as a child that when someone dies, it only means that they had completed their mission and were now being returned to ""God"", or whatever you choose to call it. But if this is infact true, then why do so many people die, who don't deserve to. i often wish that I was a religious person, i mean not a Bible loving Jesus worshiping person (no offense), but it would be nice to have that comfort. To know that their is someone I can talk to, or pray to. I used to be like that, I don't know what changed. But I somehow feel that when that part of me left me, another part of me went with it. A part of me that I guess I miss in a way, but now being in a more rational state it comes across as actually being pathetic. I mean I look at all these people who survive because their religion is always there. I mean it makes these people so possitive. Like they could fail, but as long as their God or savor was there, they'd be okay. I sometimes wish I had that, just to know that I will be okay. I don't kniw, random thoughts. Just wanted to share, if you have comments please send them.Peace."

"event","It's been quite a long time since I did this last. However, it obviously wasn't enough, because for some reason, I have obviously chosen to continue it. Y'know, with the evidence being this post. Whack.

No one's been asking me how I am, so I'm going to pretend that people are interested, and answer all of their non-existant questions for them!

Q: Where the hell have you been?
A: I was on tour with ASOB from September 19th to October 19th. Highlights included driving a boat and jetskiing for free in ELDON, MISSOURI. I got to use the free shit because my name is Eldon. Honest.

Q: Weren't you supposed to be gone longer? It's better when you're gone. Why didn't you just stay in Eldon, loser?
A: Medical emergencies (including one from me! great!) brought us home from Phoenix. Yikes! Worst drive ever! Believe me, I would have stayed in Eldon if I could have.

Q: Was LA cool?
A: The only thing I liked about LA was the homeless people. They were really nice, and considerate. I also enjoyed that there weren't many tourists. Everyone on the streets was from LA. Nothing like New York. Oh, and I met a personal guitar hero, Omar Rodriguez, at the Hollywood Guitar Center. Spoke with him for 5-10 minutes, but he couldn't come to our Knitting Factory show because his band was going to SOUTH AMERICA.

Q: What are you doing now?
A: That's a good question. Let me see if I can figure that out. I got home and almost immediately started looking for a full-time job. Guitar Center looked like a good one, so I got that. I haven't started working there because of paperwork complications, but I'll be on the schedule starting Monday.

Q: Full-time job? What about ASOB?
A: Read the news post from 11/17/04 at http://www.asobrock.com and if you have any further questions I will answer them for you, as will anyone else in the band. Personally, I need money because everything I own is broken, up to and including all of my music equipment. Plus, I have a girlfriend who has been covering my ass financially for a year and I'd like to repay the favor. Plus, I can't just sit around this house anymore having nothing to do. Except drink coffee. I do a lot of that. And smoking. I guess not much has changed.

Q: Can I buy something using your discount?
A: No.

Q: Don't you have that other band? The one that no one is going to like?
A: Yeah. I'll spare you the link. If you want to know more about it, drop a reply.

Q: You previously stated that no one's been asking you anything. Why are you doing this?
A: This interview is over. Turn off the cameras. Don't touch me. Hey! HEY! DON'T TOUCH ME."

"event","Let's say, for argument's sake, that I was looking to sell my current guitar rig...

Fender Roc Pro 1000 hybrid head (2 tube distortions; crunch and distorted, 1 famous Solid State Fender clean; footswitchable) with custom mods by me for more low end. Has a stock mid-boost. 100 watts. 4 and 8ohm outputs. FX loop stuff if you want it (i dont use it, might even replace it with something else). Used condition, but looks and sounds great.

1970s Randall cabinet. 4x12. Stock speakers that are sweet and crunchy. This is before Randall started making nu-metal shit. 8ohms. ""Hairy"" cabinet, in that it's finished in a carpet material instead of tolex. Sounds incredible with the head I have.

Would anyone want it? How much would you pay for it?

we're supposed to practice 3 times this week. fun.

i bought a new backup guitar. i went in to buy a squier telecaster with humbuckers (actually a really good guitar), but when i heard they were sold out i started playing other ones. i picked up a carlo robelli semi-hollow...and it sounded really good. i didn't think ""carlo robelli"" and ""good"" could be put into the same sentence before now. anyway, i went back the next day and bought the floor model, so i could be sure that i was getting one that i liked playing (and i got them to knock of about 30 bucks). it totally fucking rules. so dark sounding.

""napoleon dynamite"" is hysterical.

"event","i got home from enfield at 4:30am. i started writing my album-a-day (see previous entry) immediately. this means i have until 4:30am on sunday to have it all done. i have bass and drums written in MIDI for 3 songs and am working on a 4th. that got done in two hours. something tells me i'll finish a little early. i'm unhappy with one of them, but i'm not allowed to scrap songs. best idea ever. basic tracks (midis of drum and bass and whatever else needs to be midi'd) will be posted upon completion of 20 minutes of music. i plan to finish writing these parts by 9am, and then i'll run down to radioshack to get connections for my mixer to start writing/recording guitar parts. i plan to have that done by 3pm. then i write vocals, which will no doubt be unbelievably sub-par, or uncomfortably schizophrenic, which i plan to record from 5pm-7pm. then i go and touch everything up, and finalize the songs, and if everything works out, i'll be done by 2am, which is early! wish me luck.

I am going to write, arrange, and record an album in 24 hours. With no breaks. The entire thing will be documented here as it is happening. For more info on what exactly is going on, check out this page: http://crapart.spacebar.org/aad/

I will not cheat, and I will have someone with some sort of camera taking pictures so you know it's legit. It will be available for download immediately, and sale in one week.

Anyone else who wants to give this a shot, do it with me. Saturday. None of you have plans. I know you all. Being on tour is no exception.

In unrelated news, my father and I went to the Village Vanguard in the city today to see the Mulgrew Miller Trio. Absolutely fantastic. Didn't miss a beat. The few jazz-heads that read this, check 'em out if you haven't. They'll be at the Vanguard the next 3 nights, too, so don't miss it. Mulgrew Miller gets a 10 out of 10.

<lj-cut>
<b>32 Degrees In Hell:</b> I posted an ad saying I wanted a band on the East Meadow High School Bash Board. This is what happened. I played guitar and sang and wrote the worst songs ever. Shows, CDs, ""Joe Needs To Shut The Fuck Up"". While in this band I started World Wars III, IV, and V with Go Quest!, The Free Refills, High School Football Heroes. See also: Terrible Things.

<b>Donkey Bomb:</b> 32DIH broke up for a short period of time, and Dave's friend Vinny Blanda asked me, Dave, and Mike if we wanted to be in a punk band with him. Sadly, we said yes. INCREDIBLE recordings, only owned by Dave Friedrich. Contact him for more info. See also: Pennywise, Off-Rhythm-Off-Key Vocals

<b>The Neutrinos:</b> Me, Jeffto, Mike Hegarty. One practice. One song. No singer. Sounded like dissonant rock, because that's what it was. See also: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

<b>""The Dismemberment Plan"" From ""Washington"":</b> Me, Jeff, Evan, Mitch. We played The Dismemberment Plan's ""Can We Be Mature?"" at the East Meadow High School variety show, and encored with ""My Generation"". See also: """"The Dismemberment Plan"""" ""From"" """"Washington""""

<b>Your Mother's Boyfriend and the Big Money Giveaways:</b> Drugs + Superdrag = Me playing all the instruments on recordings and having Paperface for a backup band. 2 EPs turned into a ""13 Songs""-like-full-length. Decent-to-very-good pop songs. One show with this incarnation which was actually a taping for Public Access TV. Someone actually saw it and IM'd me telling me how great it was. We almost got into a fight with a drunk band on the Girls Like It Short comp. See also: Weezer, LSD

<b>Melto Bias:</b> Me, Dave Friedrich, Mikey Hegs. Cockrock in odd-time. Two songs. Featured me singing into one of those cones that cheerleaders use to ""PEP UP THE CROWD!"". Only MIDIs exist. One song almost because a Sean Eldon song. See also: People Directly Ripping Off The Hot Snakes.

<b>Sean Eldon:</b> I rediscovered the minor key and odd-time signatures. Countless EPs recorded and never released. Early stuff sounded a lot like Fugazi, middle stuff sounded a lot like At The Drive-In, new stuff sounds like The Dismemberment Plan firing cannons into a Big Muff pedal with that singer dude from Refused. Did a couple of gigs with an electric guitar and a boombox pumping MIDI CDs, and one full band gig of Me, Jeff Rosenstock, and John WorldDeDomination. We played Livingbrooks songs and smashed old computers, and then walked out the front door leaving all of the borrowed equipment feeding back. Everyone was pissed except for us. See also: Horrible shrieking in 5/4+2/16+9/8+13/8+7/4.

<b>Long Island Ska All-Stars:</b> Sean Eldon was playing a boombox gig at Union Square Lounge. Dave Dickerman, JT, Chris Malone, and Jimmy Doyle showed up and we decided to have a band play that day in the place of JT's solo thing. We played ASOB, Operation Ivy, and the Specials. I played drums. No one knew what was going on. A week later, I joined ASOB. See also: Upbeats and covers.

<b>Arrogant Sons Of Bitches:</b> The most manic-skapunk ever made. I saw this band for years. Then Jeff Rosenstock came to SeanFest II: Attack Of The Clones and asked me to join the band on guitar. I played two sold out shows in Connecticut a week later without ever practicing with the band. We tour. We're doing a new record in Boston. See also: Ambulance

<b>Thunder Crash:</b> Me, JT, and Davey Dicks were in the ASOB practice space watching the Lightning Bolt DVD. It blew us away, and since we were in a room with a band's worth of instruments, we decided to start a grindcore/noise/jazz band. I played drums, Dave played a 5-string bass through a guitar amp on the dirty channel, and JT did vocals. The next practice, we replaced JT with Jeff and our lineup was perfect. We do nothing but improv and we are owning. We will probably play a few Long Island shows. See also: Led Zepplin, Dillinger Escape Plan, Lightning Bolt DVD, 48 hours of no sleep.

There were a lot of people, here and other places, that didn't seem to like the opening bands of the Memorial Day show. The openers for the June 22nd show were officially scheduled yesterday and were all handpicked by members of ASOB. They're all great bands that pretty much everyone there is going to like. And anyone who doesn't like them EATS THEIR BOOGERS. But everyone does that anyway. So here's the lineup.

<u>ASOB Summer Tour Kickoff Party</u>
<b>Arrogant Sons Of Bitches</b> - Last show before going on the Warped Tour. http://www.asobrock.com

<b>The Know How</b> - Synth-ska band out of Gainesville, Florida. Driving 20 hours to Long Island and then 20 hours back to play this show. Great band. http://www.theknowhow.com

<b>Stray Bullets</b> - The best new ska-punk band in the entire world. Straight out of Boston on Fork In Hand records. Live show and CD are a force to be reckoned with. Everyone will love this band. http://www.bostonbullets.com/

<b>Jackmove</b> - Fun, loud, party-ska band from Virginia. Yes, party-ska. If you hear them, you feel like you're at a party. Very tight, very loud, very energetic band. http://www.jackmove.net/

<b>The Reason</b> - Ex-Fiberglass/Jaded Ways trio. Bass, drums, guitar. Everyone sings. Everyone talks between songs. Funnest band ever.

Plus, one more band to be determined.

Listen to all the bands, get into them, and then come to the show to make them feel at home. This will be a great show, genuinely. Every promotor says ""MY SHOW WILL BE THE BEST EVER!"" but this actually is. We promise. Keep posted on the website about the final band.

Sean Eldon, CEO of Guitars"

Hammond Drawbar Organ
Squeezebox Accordian
Melodica
Tom-Toms

The Plunger
The Plunger Stick
Box-Full-Of-Children's-Percussive-Instruments

Marie got home from Chicago. Good. She didn't bring Corey back with her. Bad.

Recording of the ASOB record is going on in Boston right now. I lay down my tracks over the weekend. Chinatown-to-Chinatown bus, here I come! Producer/Big D Bass Player, Steve Foote, says it can be done in 2 more 12 hour sessions, then we go to his personal studio to mix. I still haven't heard any of it, so I'm a little anxious. This will be the first full length album I am on that actually gets finished (knock on wood).

We go out on a short tour down the east coast in 2 weeks, and then at the end of June we go out with a certain popular punkrock festival for two and a half months. I am currently deciding whether or not to bring two pairs of pants, or one pair of pants and one pair of shorts. I'm thinking I'll avoid the shorts, unless I shave my legs again some time soon.

I take a Linux course (self taught, only student) this period while a Psych. class goes on. They're discussing racism. This is priceless. You have no idea."

I have had my heart set on a certain guitar for many many months. Rickenbacker 330/6 Mapleglo. This guitar is expensive. I don't have the kind of cash that I would need to go and get it. What I am asking/suggesting/forcing you to do is DONATE TO THE SEAN BIRTHDAY GUITAR FUND. ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY HELPS ME OUT. Why spend time buying me a present when you can easily say ""Here Sean, have 5 (or 500) bucks. I hope you get that guitar really soon!"" and then you're happy with the good deed you did and I'm happy with the money you gave me out of the kindness of your heart/pockets/wallet/purse.

So, is anyone out there interested in making me the happiest dude in the entire world? Leave a comment, or give my phone a call. 516-658-3046. I love you all in advance. Even those who don't celebrate my birthday as the national holiday that it is/should be.

ASOB was off this week so I got a well deserved break from all of that hectic stuff. Saturday was glorious. Sunday was great as usual. This particular Sunday gets an A+

Woke up at 12:30 (nice) and showered and such. Recording for Sean Eldon/Corey Chicago split CD at Jordan's was at 1:30. I was all anxious and stuff because I haven't actually worked on my own music in many many months. The last proper ""recording"" was in June and it didn't even get finished. The first show I'd done since the summer was the now infamous ""Livingbrooks Tribute To Destruction"". So yeah, I was excited for it. I laid down three songs in three hours, ""Rats Bats And Bugs"", ""Get A Clue"", and ""I'm A Busy Man and Busy Men Do Things Right"". During vocal tracks for the latter, I started crying (the good cry. not the bad cry.) at the end of the song for more reasons than one, so my throat was drenched in mucus. And it was the best thing ever. Listen to the unmixed version here and let me know what you think and then let me know if you want to play the songs live with me:

<a href=""http://www.asobrock.com/busy.mp3"">Sean Eldon - I'm A Busy Man And Busy Men Do Things Right</a>

So yeah, I'm really happy with the recordings, even though they're not even mixed properly. That'll be done during the week and then I can start doing artwork and waiting for Corey to turn in his songs. I know if I weren't on the album, I'd sure want to buy a copy!@!!!

Marie came at the end while I was getting rough mixes to bring home. We went and ate dinner at her grandparents' house. Awesome. Then we came home and watched some Sunday primetime TV. Even awesomer. It's just unbelievable to have her around, and be able to just reach over and give her a kiss whenever I want. And watch The Sopranos at the same time. Heaven? Close as I'll ever get."

Maybe I'll find something constructive to do, maybe one of the 3 jobs I applied at will call me, maybe I'll call one of them, maybe I'll go out both nights, maybe I'll hang out with Sean McCabe while he's home, it doesn't matter what I do, because its a WEEKEND OFF.

So then I'm just doing normal shit at home, and at around 2PM, it hits. THE WORST case of the hiccups that man has EVER seen.

"event","I turned in my English 12 term paper today. I think it's a great read. Here you go:

<lj-cut text=""The Wealthy Street Sweeper"">
     Maturity scares a lot of people. Not the word itself, because that's sort of a positive thing. It's all the linked, heavy words that come along with it. For one, responsibility. That alone is enough to cause a certain number of people to jump out of their 10th story office window. Then it's someone else's responsibility to clean up the mess they left. And then it's the family's responsibility to pay for the funeral services, as if anyone would want to be at the funeral of a man who hit an obviously unforgiving piece of pavement. Closed casket, no doubt. No amount of necro-plastic-surgery can fix that shit.
     Just as horrifying is the loss of youth. All too often, people get so caught up in acting mature when they should technically have a fucking bedtime, to the point where they never exactly go through proper childhood. Then, when the law of time takes away something they never used in the first place, they get all winded over it and live through the children they had way too young because they figured getting married would make them mature. They end up screwing up the youngster even more than they did themselves. This keeps happening until the end, granted it ever ends. We're not so sure about that yet, check back later.
     Maybe, though, maturity is so terrible because we spend an entire lifetime waiting for it to kick in, and then realize seconds before we die that we've just done a full circle back to being a stubborn child who needs constant care. Take your grandfather as an example. He was born without teeth, shitting his diapers, not capable of coherently talking or walking around on his own. He'll die in a few months after five years of being the same exact thing he was as an infant. Only now the diaper is a few sizes bigger (and the person cleaning up his mess gets paid a lot less than the one cleaning the suicidal cubicle worker off the sidewalk).
     With all of this, it's no wonder that the majority of the country's population would rather live in a fantasy world. A world where the only concern is money and how much of it you have, and the last thing to worry about is whether or not you feel like you've fully developed as a person. Who cares if you're a total douche bag who has no real friends, and even all of your ""acquaintances"" can't fucking stand you? You got a nice raise at work this month! Your skills as a fucking annoying telemarketer who constantly feels the need to call when I'm eating dinner took you to the top of the company, and you even hit bonus for the week!
     You'll save up some money and get some nice, showy items to put in your house. It's too bad that no one's going to come over to eat your Cosmetic-Surgery-Ninth-Wonder-Of-The-World-Wife's horrible cooking because real people like me know you're a prick, and your wife is, too. That luxury ""XLT SUV"" in your driveway doesn't mean you're rich, it means you spent way too much money on a shitty car. You'll spend even more on gas every day because an idiot just as stupid as you stole billions of dollars to fight a country that he couldn't even find on a map. That won't bother you, though. You're a patriot. A mature, responsible patriot. I'm supposedly Anti-American because I think all that shit is pointless. Truth is, I'm not Anti-American, I'm just Anti-You.
     Or maybe you're one of those people who thinks maturity has something to do with growing a beard and drinking wine. No. You're drunk and not properly groomed. That's the exact opposite of being mature. It has nothing to do with what's on the outside, but rather, how you deal with things on the inside. A reasonable, well-learned individual would say ""Why the hell do I need a car that can barely make it across town without needing me to refill the tank?"" or ""Jesus, I need to shave so I don't look like an idiot.""
     This jerk with the SUV and the lumberjack beard also has a set of kids, a nine-year-old boy and a sixteen-year-old girl. Since he himself has no idea how to act his fucking age, neither do his kids. Young Jimmy should be out playing with friends and scraping his knees, but instead he rots in front of the family's $2000 computer (They had to get the expensive one with all of the options and hardware they're not bright enough to figure out. Then they give guys like me way too much money to ""help"" them and I take it without hesitation. Taking advantage of people is fine as long as you're better than they are). No, Jimmy won't grow up to be the next Bill Gates, because he has a stupid father who won't ever set him straight or take him out to play catch.
     Betty, the daughter of Mr. Wolfgang Telemarketer is immature in that she's trying way too hard to act like she's a divorced middle-aged woman. She works the school getting five dollar bills for sexual favors from guys that her brother will turn into in a few short years. The money goes towards her hair and nail salon appointments where she can pretend that she has a life worth living while sitting next to her ugly friend that she keeps around so she looks better. Her Captain-Of-The-Football-Team boyfriend will beat her like the oaf he is when he finds out about the miniature whoring next week.
Mr. Wolfgang Telemarketer will buy her a new stereo system for her overpriced car to make her feel better about it. Little does he know, Betty actually needs to get a bra that fits her properly.
     Finally, when everything has hit the absolute rock bottom, this guy decides that his family is in trouble and needs serious help. They book an appointment with a family therapist, Timmy Tool. Mr. Tool, for some reason, doesn't have any diplomas, degrees, or certificates on his wall. After a couple of sessions, and a couple hundred dollars in the ""therapist's"" pocket, they are finally given the name of his ""self-help"" book, and instead of paying too much in a store, he'll even offer it to them out of the trunk of his car for a slashed price! How could ol' Wolfgang turn down this cheap, wonderful solution?
     He doesn't just buy one, he buys copies for the whole family. Well, not for Jimmy. Jimmy doesn't read very well. He's a fucking ace at his video games, though. Seriously, he's a real wizard.
     They finish the book, as if they couldn't read between the lines and see Timmy Tool's hidden message of ""I RIPPED YOU OFF"" and pretend that they've fixed themselves and become better people because they read something without illustrations. Wolfgang tells all the guys at the office about this magical book, and since they're all the same person that he is, they all do the same for their families.
     Just like a small child, immature adults think that pretending is fun, so this goes on for a couple of years with no problems. They keep getting decent paychecks, they keep hitting bonus, they keep gassing up the Hummer. In the real world, however, they still have incomplete, yet repetitive lives. Their wives are getting older, saggier, worse at cooking, and more and more useless. Their children are losers, whores, and now they're drug addicts, too. Daddy starts smoking pot to try and identify with his dope-fiend kids. It didn't say to do that in Timmy Tool's masterpiece, but that book also said that the most important part of helping yourself is to improvise. He could afford it with his promotion at work, anyway.
     If you're feeling a connection with Mr. Wolfgang Telemarketer and his family, then it's probably best that you stop reading now.
     When a very smart man coined the term ""Survival Of The Fittest"" he should have laid it out a little more detailed for the immature. ""Fittest"" doesn't always mean the strongest or the richest or the most powerful. In fact, it usually means the smartest, and most mature. When a bear cub gets separated from its mother too early, it's gonna die. Even the big strong bears die if they're not thinking, because smart human hunters shoot them and their whole family.
     Wolfgang was sitting in his office on a Monday morning, after a nice weekend of spending and fun and getting a new suit for work. He was a little on edge being that he hadn't smoked any pot in almost a week, so he reached into the back of his bottom desk drawer and pulled out a ratty sheet of magazine paper. He gazed at a picture of a stunning blonde woman, red dress and six-inch pumps, the whole deal. The caption under her read ""High Quality Escorts"" with a phone number. Anything to relieve his stress would be great right now, he figured. Plus, he still had money left over from last week's bonus.
     He arranged the ""date"" over the phone, and apparently, a skinny girl with blonde hair (his preference) named Ataria Starling was on her way. About an hour later, he gets on a knock on his door. A nice shit-eating grin spreads across his face as he adjusted himself and walked over to answer.
     You can only imagine the shock our friend Honest Wolfgang went through when he saw that his stunning blonde for the afternoon was none other than his now twenty-year-old daughter, Betty. Words were exchanged, names were called, whatever.
     When Betty left the office in tears (after getting bus fare from her unfaithful father) Wolfgang slowly shuffled back to his big executive chair. You know, the executive chair that he FINALLY realized doesn't mean shit. His eyes closed involuntarily to stop his big, mature self from crying. Everyone knows that the mature never cry! Instead, he turned his chair away from his desk, now facing his window. His big, executive window. The executive window on the 10th floor that doesn't mean shit. The executive window on the 10th floor that's only good for one thing: jumping.
     Now remember, the late Wolfgang gave advice to his office buddies to do just as he had done. As you've probably figured out already, the ""acclaimed"" self-help book was just a 400-page noose for everyone and anything that came in contact with it. This of course, cleared out an entire floor of a huge building mighty fast.
     Also remember, taking advantage of people that are stupid and immature has no bad karma attached to it. Do it as much and as often as you can. I did, and now I own an entire floor of an office building. The space was cheap, because it'd been the scene of more than fifty suicides. My company produces the ads for female escort services. We're making a fortune and we're constantly getting new offices all around the country.

"event","I woke up feeling the non-alcoholic hangover. Head was pounding in full force, I don't have any Alka-Seltzer Morning Relief left, and I was in a generally shitty mood. We got home late from the Streetlight show last night and had to go to pay CJ for the 1000 dollar song. It was just a lot of work in one day. I was ready to just call in sick to the rest of the universe and chill at home, maybe finally watch Lost In Translation. Who cares...

I fetch my cell phone which I'd heard was ringing before, and I have missed calls from John D. Fuck. I'm reminded that I have a Sean Eldon gig today. I was feeling so shitty that I contemplated not going. But John and Jeff still wanted to. Fine. Maybe it'll cheer me up, make me feel better. Sure, I'll try it.

I slip on the uniform, which is all black clothes, including a black beanie over my face with eyeholes cut out. I looked like a member of The Locust that was trying to rob a bank. I found any old electronics and computer equipment that doesn't work anymore and got into Marie's car.

Marie and I go to the venue and immediately find John, who is wandering around the front of the place. We need gear. We go in and ask a bunch of bands to not only borrow amps, but to also borrow instruments, including drums. Blah blah ""no. find someone else"" and eventually we got some grade F equipment and found ourselves on the stage.

There was a good amount of kids there, and they all were under the impression that Sean Eldon was a band, and that we had songs. They were wrong.

We started it out with a solid 2 minutes of horrible, horrible noises made with our instruments. Then we played ""Suffocation"" by the Livingbrooks, smashed computer equipment (the crowd had a look of terror when keyboard parts and CD drives went flying toward their heads) and then ""Nowhere To Go"" by the same band, and then smashed even more electronics. Pieces of everything were EVERYWHERE. Then, literally, we walked out the front door of the club and left all the gear on stage. I tended to my bleeding fingers and shuffled my feet out to Jeff's car.

It was the single most fun I've had at a Long Island show. Everyone was SO FUCKING ANGRY AT US. The few people that liked it loved it, and told me about it. I felt accomplished. I came home and drank lots of OJ, cleaned off my wound, and called it a day. I'm still done with this day."

"event","As soon as I set foot out of my house yesterday, I knew it'd be one of those ""days from outer space"" where everything that happens is extremely weird, and probably important. Not immediately important, but the kind of important that comes back in like a week, as if to say ""SEE?! YOU SAW THAT FOR A REASON.""

I'll spare you all the minute details about the early stuff in the day, but you can know that it was bad enough to make me spread out in the horizontal position across 3 chairs in my little office at PACE, desperately trying to sleep it away.

I got home and made plans with Marie. Movie at my house, dinner for me, watching me eat dinner for her. The perfect night. She gets in and the first thing she says is that her stomach doesn't feel right. We sit down, and after about 10 minutes, I was watching her in the car driving away. The way that it happened left me mighty cock-eyed. It was like I wasn't totally sure what'd just happened, even though I can explain it in under 10 seconds. Whatever, I tried to shake it off.

I was just starting to bust a nap when Dave called me. It was time for us to see <b>""The Passion Of The Christ""</b> like we'd been planning to do. Marie says she's feeling better and that maybe she'd go. Go-time comes up, and she backs out again. ""Work tomorrow is early."" Okay. I'll try to see her later in the weekend when I don't have to be in other states for extended periods of time.

We pull up to Loews making the necessary Jesus jokes, gearing toward a light-hearted end to a strange day. Joking went all the way through the previews, until the movie started.

Yeah, the whole thing is in Latin with English subtitles, but you forget about that after a half a second. That's how well it was done. Little white letters draw you in to what's happening better than most movies can do with action sequences and sex scenes. Hot sex scenes. Yeah, the movie was violent, but not totally ""BRUTAL!!!"" like everyone said it would be. Of course, we sat right behind the sissiest-ass guys for 100 miles, who were being consoled by their female dates every time a loud noise was made. When the crucifix scene came up, I forgot all about yelling ""JESUS CHRIST, YOU GOT SERVED"" and instead thought about that 40 year old woman who died in the theatre at this part. This was the last thing she saw. I wouldn't be totally pissed if that was the last thing I saw. Because it was awesome.

Anywho, movie ends, and I'm pretty speechless. I don't know whether to say ""that was great"" or ""what the fuck just happened"" or ""why doesn't the Colony let you smoke anymore"". It was a fantastic movie, but I really wasn't sure how to feel about the whole thing. I think it's awesome that it affected so many people on such a high level that there's protests outside of Mel's house. I wish I had a line of picketers protesting the ASOBeardOff because they think it's anti-semetic.

So we get out and walk to the van, but we see Leon and Greg of ""brotherly"" fame. We talked to them about it. I'm still thinking about the movie.

Needless to say, I had some morbid, religious dreams. Guess who was Jesus. I didn't sit there and take the punishment, though. I just banished everyone and had an awesome time. See? If Jesus thought like me, he'd still be here."

"event","it was one of those days, is all. one of those days.

i get to school (on time, weird) and sit down. i open up the paper and found my new ID picture:
<img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/punk/tone/face.gif"">

i finish school at like 11 o clock but i have no ride home so i figure i'll stick around and chainsmoke or chainsleep or whatever. in the middle of a great nap, one of the teachers taps me and wakes me up. his name is bill. he's over 40, bald, fat, and awesome. he gives me a grave look.

""sean, i need you to make my son a birthday card. i want it to say...""
at this point, bill put his fingers up like a picture frame, as if what he was about to say was going to be a work of art.
""Happy...Birthday...Joseph. And you know, put a truck on it or some shit.""

he shoots me this look like his brain went away on a month long vacation. scariest/best thing ever.

i get home, and watched the new episode of ""curb your enthusiasm"" on demand. best episode ever. unbelievable.

then i remembered that the fad were to be on people's court. i watched. anyone who saw knows what went down and knows that the internet is no place to express the hilarity.

then i put in the dan deacon cd, given as a present by the man himself. this is the only music to go along with this day.

this would be so much funnier if it all happened in a tree house or something."

i love getting out of school early every day.

yesterday, sean attended college.

its awesome that i keep getting mobbed by pace kids, stoned out of their brains, saying ""YO SON I HEAR YOUR GIRL IS THE JUMP OFF, SON@!!!"". i think that's good slang. you know, positive. saying I have a hot girlfriend. whatever. when asked for a picture, i showed them this:
<img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/punk/tone/iweya.gif"">
and i swear that one of the responses i got was ""that makes me hungry, kid""

in other pace news, the woman running the ""talent show"" (im afraid to call it that) SIGNED ME UP WITHOUT TELLING ME."

4) 3 burritos for breakfast, 4 clementines for lunch, 5 slices of pizza for dinner

"event","I'm in Williamsport, PA at Dave's girlfriend's dormroom. Me, Dave, and Jeff came here to escape hanging out with JT's pornstar girl, and when I say pornstar girl, I mean a girl who bangs JT who happens to be a pornstar.

This is still fun. I'm bummed to have to come home so soon, even though it felt like I was in Florida a year ago, when in fact it was 2 weeks. Whatever, there's stuff for me on Long Island that I'm looking forward to seeing/getting back to.

I successfully survived a month with 2 outfits. I showered every single day without fail. Fuck you. I ate nothing but noodles, animal crackers, and grapefruit. I drank nothing but coffee and water. I have perfected the art of shoplifting when I'm strapped for cash and really need a belt because I lost 5 pounds.

Tomorrow we go to Cleveland. My second time there. We'll be getting to the Rock'n'Roll Hall Of Fame at about noon, then we have a show at 6 at a place called ""Subs and Suds"" which serves nothing but sandwiches and beer. After that we come back to Pennsylvania to record ""Plea For Peace, Sorry We Lost Your Dolly/Hand Truck"" for free. Then we play in Connecticut and I get to reunite with my one friend who isn't in my band.

Supposedly the state of New York started calling my school about my unexplained disappearance. Uh oh. Let's see how that works out when I try to get on the bus to go back.

I have masturbated in more states than the average person. It's a new rule in the band so we get into less fights.

Teenage dream. Tour. It's almost here. For the past 24 hours, I've been mentally pacing back and forth to the point where I get physically tired. This made for taking four naps yesterday, which is two more than my usual routine. I've been going through everything that makes me excited about punkrock and do-it-yourself ethics. Books, movies, articles, albums, whatever. I couldn't help but smile on the inside every time an aunt or an uncle or a cousin asked me about it at last night's party. I smiled on the outside, too, I guess. But that's just common courtesy for when a family member is talking to you.

My clothes are folded, I've packed up some key CDs, stuffed my wallet with a pre-paid phone card (thanks, Marlboro Miles) and a list of contacts for venues (thanks, Internet), and I should have a blanket cleaned for me by the time we're ready to leave tomorrow. It's all that I can think about, because it's all that I've wanted all of this fucking time.

We're playing legendary clubs and having new people watch us every night. We're going more than a thousand miles away from what is normal for me. When everyone else is watching a ball drop for New Years, I'll be PLAYING A SHOW. Showering will not be a must. Who fucking gives two shits if I'll be wearing the same pants I was 3 weeks ago? Not this guy.

Everyone can feel absolutely free to give me a ring for some support at 516-658-3046. We'll be back for a homecoming show on what looks like January 19th. I'll try to put up an entry or two whenever we get to a computer.

i got my backup guitar and i'm more than happy about it. pops got me a case for it to make it more of a ""guitar"".

I'm excited about going to Georgia, for a few reasons. I wanna see Jeff. I wanna see Jeff's band. And I wanna drive around my old town and shit. I can already feel the nostalgia. It's coming out of my flushot wounds. Also excited about one of the Florida dates, because my grandparents are like...cooking us a feast. Plus, I get to see them once in a blue moon. Good. My cousins'll go to the show. Good. Tour tour tour. One more fucking week.

Corey's home. Hung out with Marie and him last night. Marie gave me a <b>""BAD MOTHER FUCKER""</b> wallet for Christmas. That's fuckin...awesome. I stuffed my Sean Awesome Certificate of Awesomeness inside of it until I get some money and a state ID card.

My guitar shipped on Tuesday from California, which means I probably won't have it this weekend for the big shows. Oh well. Looks like I'm playing the chair. Unless someone wants to LEND ME A GUITAR FOR FRIDAY AND SUNDAY.

Pissing PACE kids off with loud rock and roll is fucking awesome. Priceless, in fact. I'm gonna bring an acoustic guitar tomorrow and make them miserable. While skateboarding into them.

Fuck bees.

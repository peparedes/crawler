"event","So... Last winter I&nbsp;moved here and had friends pretty instantly. Most of which were from Michigan and returned to Michigan... Or one was shipped back to South Africa... or one liked me too much to be friends. This presents a problem.<br /><br />I haven't worked this past week and have been bored out of my mind... Not making money = not spending a dime which means lots of down time at home, kicking it solo. Only problem is, I've kicked it solo in this damn apartment for the majority of the time since I've been in Colorado, except for the past month when the man of choice, Alex, moved back to higher altitude. Well, Alex had himself some knee surgery and had me oh-so-willingly there to help him hand and foot and, well, knee too. But now that Mr. Independence can walk again, its time to go back to my solo self, which is easier said than done. <br /><br />Well today, he did something very generous and replace my busted radio in my car with a nice stereo, but that's all the Alex time this girl gets for the day... the 15 minutes it took him to replace my fucking radio. So why does this bother me so much? Is it because I've been sitting in the damn apartment alone almost the entire day? <br /><br />My main problem is that why do I&nbsp;feel so abandoned? Why does the majority of the female population clutch so hard to the little things men do for them and get torn apart when it stops... I am so guilty of this it makes me sick to my stomach.<br /><br />So I did what any respectable girl can do... I made my man's favorite food - mashed potatoes - and ate the entire thing all by myself, just to silently spite and pretend I won some battle. Now I have to fight the urge to put on some chic flick that would make me cry but all of us girls know, I want to do that oh so bad.<br /><br />So Before I sink in anyone's mind and sound completely insane and a commitment freak, I had something else join the play on my emotions: A love letter, written this past May. When one of the sweetest men I have ever met left me for possibly forever, ahem, correction... I might as well have packed his bags for him and shut the door on the plane. Regardless, he is still one of the sweetest and gone for good on my decision. Anyways, he sent me a message while leaving the country... A message that I&nbsp;would not get until today, 5 months later. <br />This was of course written in a language that I only know how to say &quot;fuck you&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; in, convenient. Well, with hours of &quot;solo time&quot; and an iPhone translator, I&nbsp;have decoded the message.... and can't stop crying. <br /><br />This man would leave his life for me and I don't like it? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME? I am completely crazy for some guy who has left me 2 twice and puts me on the back burner for &quot;friend time&quot; but we're just friends of course... Boyfriend and girlfriend? Fuck, not even in my wildest dreams... I just get the shaft as if I was one but lack the commitment agreement. Yet, half way around the world and man that refuses to believe he will ever meet someone like me, let alone better. <br /><br />I said it before... I think I&nbsp;need to move to Finland :( <br />I miss the feeling of loving arms so much... I&nbsp;just can't seem to find a personality and arm combo that I truly adore back. <br /><br /><br /><br />T&auml;m&auml; on ensimm&auml;inen (first) rakkauskirje, jonka koskaan kirjoitan.. <br />Pelk&auml;st&auml;&auml;n ajatus siit&auml;, <br />ett&auml; en ehk&auml; koskaan tule n&auml;kem&auml;&auml;n sinua on tunne mik&auml; en olisi koskaan halunnut tuntea.<br />Tuntuu kuin osa minusta puuttuisi ja tyhjyys valtaa minut&hellip; <br />Jos en koskaan en&auml;&auml; n&auml;e sinua, toivon sinulle kaikkea hyv&auml;&auml; ja toivon, <br />ett&auml; jonain p&auml;iv&auml;n&auml; l&ouml;yd&auml;t rakkauden ja uskot sen olevan todellista.. <br />Toivon my&ouml;s ettet unohda kuinka t&auml;ydellisi&auml; olimme yhdess&auml; ennen kuin menetin sinut Coloradolle.. <br />Kun tulin luoksesi viimeist&auml; kertaa lupasin etten itkisi vuoksesi, <br />mutta kun n&auml;in sinut kaikki tunteeni tulivat esille.. <br />Ja olin kuin pikkupoika joka ihastui ensimm&auml;ist&auml; kertaa.. <br />Muista mit&auml; iso&auml;itisi on sanonut sinulle.. <br />Etsi itsellesi hyv&auml; suomalainen mies..&nbsp; <br />Haluan sinun tiet&auml;&auml;, ett&auml; olet t&auml;ydellisin nainen, jonka olen koskaan tavannut.. <br />Rakastan sinua<br /><br /><br />I don't ever want to loose this.&nbsp;<div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div><br /><br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","So on a different note, away from my new writing of relationships and debauchery... <br /><br />I don't need knee surgery... they dont know whats wrong with it but I start intense physical therapy today, in one hour... this better do the trick bc after that, its to the needle... a needle full of steroids into the back of my knee.

"event","<input type=""hidden"" id=""gwProxy""><!--Session data--></input><input type=""hidden"" id=""jsProxy"" onclick=""jsCall();"" />I always seem to end up in the same place... <br /><br />I've always dated... had boyfriends... been happy... and then ripped their hearts out and pranced away to find my next victim. Not to sound like a complete Ice Queen, I&nbsp;definitely never go into relationship with the intention to make boys cry. I think most of the boys I've been with will all would agree that I&nbsp;was pretty damn awesome for the majority of the relationship. <br /><br />As I get older, I'm learning something different. Maybe its Karma, maybe its just my womanly instincts kicking in, who the fuck knows. What I do know is that I'm sick of crying and I feel like that's all I have done for the past 3 years. Every man I&nbsp;meet seems to be either the man of my dreams (which he doesn't see, of course) or the man I want to chain to the Great Wall in China so they are as far away as possible (and of course these are the ones that want to show me the world... after knowing me for all of 3 days).&nbsp;<br /><br />My current &quot;man of my dreams&quot;, which of course cant be the man of my dreams because I&nbsp;find myself crying... yet again, had knee surgery. I&nbsp;have been there to help him hand and foot because he really doesn't have his own. The healing process is quite fast and I immediately asked if I was over staying my welcome at his place, the answer was no but a quick explanation about privacy came to follow. No problem, I've been working over 40 hours at my painfully... painful job and I never come over without calling, and without bringing dinner. Well Michelle, dreams don't last forever. Guess who is walking and immediately a fucking prick about the girl sleeping in on his bed. <br /><br />I do understand that guys and girls have different ideas about things... Women are programmed to nurture, mother, and ultimately reproduce. Guys on the other hand, I have no clue how they're wired but I think we all agree, its completely different. What I don't understand is that if its is our role, as man and woman, to find a lover and reproduce... why the fuck did whoever make it so damn hard to get along with one another? I'm in my mid 20's and by no way shape or form am I&nbsp;ready and wanting to get married, settle down and pop out little demon babies. What I&nbsp;do want is someone that I can hang with, sees eye to eye with me, laughs and we don't step on each others toes. I'm sadly coming to conclude that this just isn't in the plans for me. <br /><br />I have no problem meeting super cool guys. Every one of them swoops me up, wines and dines, romances and throws it back in my face with the &quot;sorry, I can't have a girlfriend&quot;... WHAT THE FUCK!? THEN WHY DID YOU TAKE ME OUT. But after hearing this, twice, and when I finally back away... they all come running back, I&nbsp;know what the deal is... I'm just not the girlfriend for them, and like the one before, they will find her and date her and make her their girlfriend as soon as possible, god knows you don't want the good ones to get away. <br /><br /><br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","So, I originally thought that it could be interesting to write more about my new life on this timeless blog that follows me through so many years... BUT, now I&nbsp;see that the only thing worth really writing about (at this point) is the absolutely, wonderfully stupid situations I get myself into with men. This may not hold true forever... With snow comes new priorities and to me (who gives a fuck about anyone else reading this) is interesting... Come to think of it, I do give a fuck about anyone who would read my ramblings - so, keep reading - if for some reason its interesting now, I don't think things will change anytime soon. 

Back to my first thought. I have, in the past month, managed to gain a friend, give the ICY shoulder, meet two more and have one scramble back... oh men. Like I admitted before, I love them. Now, what I think has happened to me is that I have become very much okay with just dating and not actually getting serious. This is a direct result of caring too much for someone when they don't feel the same back... this is also the cause of many problems. I become convinced that everyone just wants to casually date as well. WRONG. Oh where do I&nbsp;even start... lets not and say we did. What my problem is, without some boring back story of some dates and shit, I meet really cool guys that I know I'm not going to marry so I don't try to pursue. I enjoy the company and laughs, but at the end of the day I know its just not going to happen. So far, 2 have seriously fallen into this category. 

So the next genre of guys are the ones that I&nbsp;think and would like to be interested and really aren't. OR they could be but just want to date more casually than what I&nbsp;even want. Funny how that works out. This is also a direct result of something serious: Karma. For every guy that gets a little upset because I don't like them as much, there is an equal that I'm interested in that doesn't like me as much. One in particular, and for once its not Alex. This one that I&nbsp;just can't seem to grasp drives me crazy -- probably why I want my hands on him oh so bad. We have excellent times together and have good talks and even better late night shit talking sessions on the walk home, at home, after hours. I am not interest number one and I'm down with that... But I am not down with becoming nothing at all. This is a work in progress and this is all I want to elaborate on because it frustrates me greatly. I&nbsp;just can't figure this one out. 

That basically leaves Alex. The only one that gets a name mentioned. This relationship between us, bound never to be serious... is... serious? I'm so whip lashed about finally getting what I've been wanting that it might not actually be what I&nbsp;want. Hm. 

I need to sleep, thought this would settle my mind... I think it actually did the opposite. I'm drowning in men, hopefully this will stir up some pleasant and creative dreams for when I close my eyes :) One can hope!"

"event","I'd like to think that I&nbsp;have made a lot of new friends here... But I tend to befriend guys... Almost all of my friends are men, always has been and probably will always be this way. I&nbsp;am fine with this, that's why I do it. I get along with them better, my humor fits better, all that shit. 

This way of life has always worked for me... Up until now. I am coming to realize that guys and girls are not friends here. I think I'm going to break a lot of hearts while here, and probably have mine broken more than once.

Too many men = my head is spinning with a shit-eating grin on my face. Too much fun. Too much trouble."

"event","I haven't looked at this account since I moved from Marquette... Early December, maybe even late November... My life, as usual, is something that needs to be watched from the big screen and not actually lived. 

I did it. I graduated with my degree in geography and minor in earth science. I packed up and left my favorite little life in the Upper Peninsula and my family in Metro Detroit and did what I&nbsp;have been talking about for the last who knows how long... Moved to Colorado. I worked at Copper for the winter, met new people, became better friends with others and lived the Summit County life of no school, lots of snow and a lot more drinking. I've gotten to know new towns, different outdoor surroundings, and I'd like to think I bettered my skiing. 

I moved from little Marquette to just slightly bigger Summit County and I don't know how I feel about it. More people, but not good people like you find in the North Woods of the Midwest. My friends are awesome... and not surprisingly, all from NMU. I&nbsp;have met people who are dirt bag hippies, couch crashing for who knows how long. I&nbsp;have met bro-bras enough to fill a baseball stadium; they think they are god's gift to anything that notices them. I have met the fakes, the ones that think they are all that but really need to wake up and smell the coffee... Its a really weird thing to sit back and observe. Beyond all this change in friends and people around me, I&nbsp;do still enjoy it. There are more people than Marquette, which means I can actually go out and not know every single person in every restaurant or bar. The girls are few and far between, so ladies own a lot of the night scene (I'll get to that later). I watch skiing and snowboarding on the television whenever I feel like flipping to that channel. I am surrounded by endless amounts of adventure seekers and live in one of the most fit states in the country. There is still snow on the mountains and its almost July. I&nbsp;have met a Marmot, drove with herd of deer, watched the sun rise over a wolf and hollered at a moose. Not to mention the breathtaking views around every road bend. It is what I&nbsp;have been looking for for as long as I can remember.

The winter has ended and I&nbsp;have found permanent work outside of the resort world for the first time in 5 years. This may sound like an easy thing to start on, but sadly, my new job is a story for another day. Lets just say its hard work and I am killing myself trying to be the best this place has ever seen. Fingers crossed. 

Chapter 1: LIVING
Ahhh, Summit County. The mecca for ski bums and the outdoors lovers. Where to start... 
Silverthorne: I live in Silverthorne... Ruled by the rich and by outlet malls. Hummers are the town's bird and half the population doesn't speak english. I live up on this large hill called Wildernest, where all the middle class ski bums live, tucked away from the rich ranch owners. I love it. Too far and too high up to walk to and from the bars, which means lots of quality home time spent with the roommates. I share loft with my roommate Scott and its pretty sweet. Our apartment is cozy and nicely situated somewhere close to 10,000 feet above sea level (the stairs are a bitch). 
Frisco: Downtown living. Just like Marquette. No resort here, just a bunch of little motels off Main st. A few bars and an interesting night life to say the least. Frisco owns my Wednesday nights, exception of tonight, and I surrender my class at the door of a bar called Johnny G's... Which has free drinks for the ladies until midnight... Very rarely do I remember past 12:30 or spend any money (other than tips) on these nights. Frisco is perfect for crazy bar nights. I have friends speckled throughout the little town, which makes it perfect to crawl onto someone's couch on drunk nights. 
Breckenridge: Oh Breck, how I&nbsp;loathe thee. Bars, bars bars... young girls and super expensive bar tabs. Yet, fun... I don't have an opinion on Breck yet cause I've only been out twice there... Last time I was convinced sleeping in a car with 2 Marquette boys was the choice way to spend the night (in a parking lot behind the bar at which we were just drinking at) and ended up being dragged home by my man of choice with about a hundred dollars worth paid bar tab receipts in my pocket. 
Copper: I&nbsp;love copper, but its a resort... and my former place of employment. The bars are fun if you hit the right night and you end up dancing until 2 am in a bar the size of my living room, which isn't large. The employee housing rooms are even smaller and smell funky, but you don't realize that until you wake up the next morning finding you slept with your contacts in and you have to run to work within the next ten minutes.
Outside of Summit, I have found a new love, Denver: I absolutely love Denver. A big city where people actually walk the streets, get lunch, and are nice to strangers... WHO EVER KNEW THIS EXISTED!!! Not a little girl from Detroit, thats for sure. I love Denver and we'll just leave it at that.

Chapter 2: MEN
What would my live journal entry be without some rediculous love story drama that I endlessly find myself drowning in? First, an understanding of Summit County's girl to guy ratio needs established. There are double the men here... Yes ladies, double might even be an understatement... BUT, this place is a walking sexual disease... So he might be really hot, but if there are more than 2 other girls making eyes at him, you might want to keep your pants buttoned. 
I left Marquette smitten over a Finnish man... One that was going back to Finland at the end of the school year. He came to visit in Colorado more than twice, spending way more money and time and attention than I deserved. In the end, it wasn't meant to be... I was probably on an unfortunate rebound after all the bullshit that Adam kid put me through... yet again, a tale that either needs to be buried or saved for another day. My Finnish love interest wanted me to move to Finland with him this May when it was time for him to leave, and when I declined, the relationship abruptly ended... 
The next in line was someone I worked with. MISTAKE is always writen all over that situation. I had met yet another ski tech... another situation for me that should be an immediate red flag. This man was full of southern hospitality... and being from the midwest and not something I had not been introduced to before, southern hospitality will make any Michigan girl weak in the knees. I found myself smiling and being made dinner. Now, to make this really clear... The straight way into my cold and confused heart is food... food and pretty much only food. This man wanted to be my boyfriend... flat out wanted to be in a serious relationship. This is not something I need after my Adam Bomb. I fled...
At the very end of what I&nbsp;just described: Ski Tech numero Dos... I went to a party, ahem, a pimps and hoes party... classy. I&nbsp;had a few guys trying to talk to me, trying to buy me drinks... I&nbsp;had noticed a guy. Ahem, a guy in a tall tee, a tie and a fitted hat. Holy bro bra... But, holy HOT HOT HOT... But I&nbsp;was having fun and ignored the fact that I&nbsp;definitely thought he was the best looking in the bar. Well, my neglectence worked and it went a little something like this &quot;Hi, my buddy over there wants me to film him break dancing... I'm really drunk and was wondering if you could come help me work my camera&quot;. Now, I might have been born CLOSE to yesterday... But when I&nbsp;see a pretty brand new Sony HD camera that this man is pointing at, I&nbsp;know I'm getting hit on. I&nbsp;laughed in his face but left the dude that was talking my ear off, only for him to get in a fight with my new tee and tie interest's friend. I left and said where I'd be if he really wanted to talk to me. When he showed up later, I didn't say much but managed to grab his pen and write my number on his hand... my correct number and even my 8 lettered name. The next day, I panicked. I never give that info out... no way was he ever going to call... Well, mister AV (whose name I&nbsp;had no memory of the next day) has become my best friend and my biggest love interest in a really long time... Unfortunately, he is an Adam #2... Recovering from a breakup, way more legit than Adam's situation... but still, I see the red flag. We've dated... we've swooned... we've taken a step back... ahhh. This is my man drama that I&nbsp;so continueously write about on these blogs. I think I should leave AV at that for the night because in my experience with my man descriptions, they aren't short and they aren't detached. AV will not be excluded from this, sadly enough. Maybe I'll get lucky and it will end before I&nbsp;find time to write about my struggles with him... 
So. Because of the man drama so briefly mentioned above... I set out on a mission, a drinking and meeting mission. This mission consisted of whiskey and landing my newly found African best friend and myself men. Real men. Hot men. and most of all, drunk as skunks like we were. This was an adventure that only Copper could handle because it's bartenders knew us, hooked us up and knew better than to cut us off when the time came. I found myself quickly buzzed up and in an epic guitar hero war... big mistake. When it comes to guitar hero, I think I'm the shit and I'm really not. So here I am calling rematch after rematch with a guy I randomly challenged about 4 songs before. 3 pitchers and 5 whiskeys later, we were a sloppy dance party soon to be sleeping 5 deep in the smelly employee housing. This is how I met Dale. Oh Dale... Poor sweet, absolutely not my kind of guy Dale. Dale snatched my number in a drunken stumble saying he lost his phone and needed me to call it and has been calling it ever since. Dale met me at the bar one night in Denver when my best friend was visiting, good ole AV showed up too. This is not my idea of a great time, good think I&nbsp;was absolutely forget-my-own-name drunk and Alex put me in a cab and took me home (he's good at this). I received texts all night pretty much calling me a whore and had a pretty pissed AV on my hands wanting to kick some kid named Dale's butt. Dale had proceeded to take me to a Nuggets game, dishing almost 200$ on each ticket and not asking money back... Actually refusing the money at one point. This kid lives in Denver, and has since the Nuggs game, showed up in Summit at my local bar environments: this is immediately followed by texts asking me to come where he is and to be his girlfriend. Yet again, I&nbsp;have ran. He has no education... Barely a job... Live life freely... Congrats, you're doing what every one talks of doing but really knows that they suck once they do. Lets just say, he still has my number and still calls.
There are more... bunches more. Its quite ridiculous actually. I love men and I really enjoy having as many as possible... But when one has made out with your best friend for an entire night and doesn't get that that might be the reason you don't return his date request, you come to realize that the guys here may be a tad desperate... Desperate meaning pathetic. I have reason to think that this man fiasco will continue until I move from this women dry town or until someone puts a ring on my finger. Dear jesus, its going to be a long road. 

I do have to admit, my desire to write here is specifically from reading and watching too much television. Entourage has given me the great desire to become famous and have so much money that I don't know what to do with it (and have so much money that I don't need a man to preoccupy my time... I'll be doing way too much sweet shit to have a man hanging around). Californication has brought up the blog interest and made me think &quot;holy crap, I have a blog!&quot;. Last... My new idol, Chelsea Handler of Chelsea Lately. I had not watched her show until I was actually half way through this puke pile of life and words, but her books are hilarious and remind me incredibly of my friends and my own lives... Maybe someday my crazy life will make me money, too bad I need to write it all down to remember any of it. 

Thats it. A BREIF account of my life so far in a new place far away from everything I've known and built. Hopefully it will be a better one than the mess I seemed to have left behind... I mean, hopefully, I have learned something from my hectic and stupic past. 

cheers."

"event","<pre>Michelle,<br /><br /> <br /><br />Thanks for the taking the time for offering some good ideas.  I was hoping<br />that students would understand that for a definition, two good, strong<br />sentences of ""fact"" would get two points.  Unfortunately, a ""handful of<br />words,"" which many students gave me make it difficult for me to evaluate<br />whether or not they really understand the concept.  And the essay questions,<br />again, I instruct everyone to be precise and not wordy / fluffy. That does<br />not mean that you still cannot write 100 words of precision and<br />to-the-point-statements. If my instructions made it sound like two sentences<br />would suffice for the essay questions, then I must change that!! As for<br />providing examples on how to write appropriate answers for an exam will<br />probably never happen in my class.  I appreciate your idea, but this is a<br />300 level college class and I by this point college students should know how<br />to write.  Unfortunately, the level of writing and critical thinking ability<br />I see dropping every year.  Not to mention the fact that the exam is ""open<br />book.""  I still think lack of preparation and general lack of seriousness of<br />intent among many students taking a web course nowadays is really at the<br />root of the problem. Your performance on the exam and taking the time to<br />write me indicate that you are obviously above the average to which I am<br />referring.  If you have time this summer or this fall, please make an<br />appointment to stop by my office and I can show you many examples of the<br />kind of student work I refer to above.  I think you would be shocked! Again,<br />thanks for taking the time to write, and I will change my instructions in<br />the hope that student performances will improve.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Richard Eathorne<br /><br /><br /><br />I just got this email from my HARDEST professor at NMU... hardest meaning... Mean, Cruel, Unusual, I <br />am retaking... lets see, ALL the classes I initially took from him. <br /><br />People were bitching about the exam grades and he had to go over what an essay question should<br />consist of, and I will admit that I was confused on his instruction as well, so I went out on a limb<br />to write him back to clarify why I think everyone was confused... and this is what I got back.<br /><br />BTW, no way am I stopping by his office! He likes to date/hit on students. hahaha. ew. <br /></pre>"

"event","I had the oddest dream last night... I know how annoying it can be when people tell others about their dreams, but this was just so flipping out of the blue.

Marquette was Northville... Everyone from 2003 was there... at the bars. 
I was at the sorry excuse for a dance club that we have called the Matrixx with Cecily - I ordered a ginger ale and captain and went to go find other people when i go to turn from the bar and theres Katie Abbo... Now, I didn't even talk to this girl in high school, know nothing about her in real life. But there she is in my dream, at the bar... SHIT FACED. 

So Katie is sits next to me at a bar stool and can hardly keep her head up... and starts yelling at me for sleeping with her boyfriend. what the hell. I ask her who her bf is... thinking that Adam has been playing us. And she calls me a whore and to just deal with the mess I've made. Turns out she was dating Peter Kelly??? WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE COMING FROM IN MY HEAD!? I told her that I have had a bf for 10 months named Adam and haven't even heard of Pete Kelly since graduation. The bar cuts her off bc shes so drunk and her friends come and get her.

Next thing I know, Kim Sebastion and other random girls are coming up to me asking if I'm okay... Karly, you were in my dream... Kar was sitting 3 stools down and had managed to steal my drink in the midst of all this drama and was pouring it into other peoples empty glasses. And Andrea Gorecki was talking about fitting boobs into tube tops and.... what the heck, it was so weird. 

Bumpus was playing at the upfront and I was trying to get people to come with me bc the N'ville kids had never heard of Bumpus... 

I think i need to go dance to bumpus tonight, i think thats what all this is telling me. yup. haha."

"event","So I've been reading all my friends posts - its really neat to see where everyone is. Especially when they aren't talking to anyone in particular. :) I rather enjoy it. <br /><br />I'm here:<br />My larger than life desk is back in my itty bitty apartment. I like sitting at it, makes me feel important, and I tend to do more work when I have it, which is a rather cool observation to make... I am literally 3 feet from where I usually do my homework and it makes all the difference sitting up right at a actual desk. And to make it even sweeter, I have gotten into the habit of brewing coffee and putting it into my thermos so I don't have to walk to the kitchen, I feel like I'm at an office job while sitting here. weird. <br /><br />On my mind: that snow storm I typed about earlier this week... 3 inches of the heaviest snow I think I have ever felt... But not nearly as huge as they had predicted... Its currently melting. I haven't skied in almost 2 weeks, and I don't care, Ive been working on school :) I'm ready for the beach. BUT BUT BUT! I flippin check the weather this morning and what do I see ""WINTER STORM WARNING""... Again!? You've got to be kidding... Last storm the predicted up to a foot of new snow... this storm they are predicting 9 to 17 inches?? insane. ridiculous. <br /><br />My family here consists of:<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://photos-f.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v192/146/44/40601500/n40601500_32554821_2975.jpg"" /><br />this man :) And between the 2 of us... All these funny little ones:<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.naturesreflexions.com/images/black-kitten.gif"" /><br />I don't have a cam, but this is what he looks like. My Rossi Cat, hes a goof. <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.mikescritters.com/critters/reptiles/fat_tailed_gecko.jpg"" /><br />Badonk. as in.. Ba-donk-a-donk. Because of his fat ass.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.dwazoo.com/images/tours/piranha01.jpg"" />Chopper. The Piranha. He's got a complex and won't eat in front of people.<br />And the newest additions: <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://gallery.pethobbyist.com/data/19194paofu1.jpg"" /><br />These guys! Yet again, not my actual picture, but the same 2 feesh. I don't have names for them yet, but they are funny guys and we leave their tank next to Chopper's and he just stares at them as if drooling for a bite. haha. <br /><br /><br />This semester is almost done, thank god. It hasn't been a bad one but I'm excited for some new classes... such as:<br />1st Session Summer = Earth Hazards, Latin America Human Geography, and Intro to Film?<br />2nd Session = Drawing and Illustrating. <br />* Now, as most of you may have noticed over the years that I am studying Geography and Earth Science... Why the hell am I taking Film and Drawing??? I'll tell you. NMU IS GAY AND I NEED 124 CR. TO GRADUATE. ALL THE CLASSES REQUIRED FOR MY MAJOR ONLY = 116 CREDITS. I HAVE TO WASTE MONEY ON DUMB CLASSES JUST TO REACH THAT 124 LIMIT. How fucking gay. :)<br /><br />and for my last... LAST. semester... wait, let me repeat it because I like how it sounds... LAST SEMESTER OF MY UNDERGRAD CAREER!!! I will be taking a simple 12 credits :)<br />GC 205 - writing and geographic research... Boo. <br />GC 202 - Intro to Soils. One of the best classes offered in the department :) yay!<br />&amp; GC 489 - Human Impact... if they could make a course in the 800 level, Im sure this would qualify. <br />I'm going to be writing and researching up the wall, but... ITS THE END!<br /><br />Anyone willing to make the 450 mile drive from downstate is more than invited to come party in this celebration that I am indeed finally... FINALLY, graduating :)"

Our park here at MM consists of... 3 parks. beginner, intermediate and advanced... 
I have been hitting all baby jumps in the beginner park, learning 180s on them and stuff... Hitting all the sliders as well...
In the intermed. park = 2 of the 6 jumps learning grabs... I have been content with this... 

Well, I now have nailed all the jumps in the inter. park, the double wide rail, the hip, the flat to down street box, and hitting and NOT KNUCKLING!!! FUCKING CLEARING all but the fucking huge jump in the advanced park :) the last jump I tried wasn't pretty -- but it was sweet.&nbsp; 

So I still like skiing... I just need to pull my head out of my ass and quit being emo.

So I had weird dreams last night... Like about catching crickets, cause the crickets in my lizard change have yet to stop chirping in a week... they have now infiltrated my dreams...
The next dream was me trying to nail the flat to down... over and over again.
The third was about visiting colorado, and I came back to the mitten early, only to decided that I had 200 dollars and could go back for the rest of the weekend... And how I was going to tell my mom this without getting her pissed.

I didnt sleep well... and now, back to the hill... work time.

We hardly talked over Spring Break but I think it was the started therapy that we desperately needed. I can't even get into details about our problems... Not because there are many, because there is only truly on thing to work on - It almost an embarrassing issue - this could be fun to fix but it looks like it might just tear me down completely. whatever.<br /><br />My cat just burped. weird.<br /><br />I'm starting to panic about graduation... I need 124 credits to graduate. I'll be at 100 after this winter term. This is feasible, but its going to be a shit ton of work and motivation... I am seriously lacking motivation. I can't believe I'm starting to feel this way, but as of right now, I think I may actually hate this town. I doubt that this feeling will last past the summer, but as of this moment this town is under my skin. The university is pissing me off... The small town atmosphere is fucking gay. Yoopers piss me off. I want a goddamn high way where I can drive faster than 55... I want Restaurants, a damn Mall, I WANT BEST BUY AND BORDERS BOOKS!! I want a real coffee shop where I can do my homework until 3am. I want Olgas, real bad... and Olive Garden... these restaurants aren't even that good and I'm still craving them...<br /><br />This is becoming a battle between me and this town rather than my grades and school...

It all started with Adam being bummed out about something... Turns out it was about Joan.
I'm done. I walked out on him... Broke it off...&nbsp; Broke my heart... But I have a good bounce back period.

He's a fucking idiot in love with a god dammed nasty whore, who is currently dating someone she met off craig's list... gross. 
I have amazing friends and family though, and they always pull through when I need it. 

My crew/hill family are wonderful... They picked up all my hours this week for spring break, got me a new hat for this trip I'm about to tell you about and talked me through all of it over beers during our race night. My boss stashed myself, himself, and 2 other really close employees sick Smith hats, I got mine early because I'm running out of town for a few days.... My boss also made me feel awesome with a comment he made the other night ""He's an idiot if he can't get over someone when he has you..."" thank you Brandon, Intern, Roan, and my ladies, you are all fucking wonderful. I have the best and biggest group of best friends in the world...

So, next is how awesome my family is... In the heat of all this chaos, my mom and dad pulled through with funding me to go... to... my favorite place in the world... COLO-FUCKING-RADO. :) I leave tonight at midnight and will be back next week... 

Since I get to head out west, it means I have a handful of best friends that I get to see to help me through as well.
Pretty pants just got out there yesterday &lt;3 Girl time with Elly, finally &lt;3 Mikutowski needs girl comforts as well &lt;3

I love everyone. 
I feel like I'm on ecstasy... I want to hug and kiss everyone, tell them how awesome they all are... 


Now, I also get to see whats to come of this heart that has been torn by 2 dudes... because Adam isn't worth my heart as of now, probably not ever... I wonder if Jacob is ;) He's so cute. .. btw... and he skis... so hot... btw... lol.

I am one boy crazy idiot. I honestly don't go more than a week it seems without having someone of interest around me. This needs to change. 

But whatever. Heres an update.

Thanksgiving was cool - visited home... Lots of family time and if you ever want an NHS reunion, hit up the wagon wheel. 

Finals are done - I did not do as well as I wanted to this semester... I fell apart 100% at the end, I have nothing to blame but myself except that i think my work schedule gives me no time to play, I needed lazy time and just didn't organize and prioritize correctly. 

The ski hill has been open for around 3 weeks now &lt;3 it looks as though we are going to have a good winter. 
I don't think spring break is going to be happening this year like I wanted it to, $$ is tight and the bar I work at has been a bit dead lately, I think some of the bar tenders have the tendency to scare some of the regular clients away... whatever. 

Adam and I are good. thank god. After reading all that dumb shit from last spring about eric... james... wayde... what the hell was I doing. Adam is thinking about going back to school for a little bit :) 
He originally wanted to leave MQT by now... and then he said might as well stay until the snow melts... and recently the summer was looking ideal for money and moving time... Now its might as well be in school for another few semesters, put back my loans and get more money. I won't ever say it to him, because I just like to dream that this may be a little bit about me - He's not in love with me... He won't fall in love with me... for a long time... But we have something, something solid - and its something I can count on. this is what I have been looking for. 


this is my life as of now. yay. 

Now I have to get ready to be at that stupid bar for the next 7 hours..."

As I'm sitting in class, thinking about SNOW! I checked the lake temps and the wave height.... EPIC conditions...

"event","So I work at the hick ass bar right downtown Marquette.&nbsp; It's ridiculous, its interesting, and most of all... it is the most emotionally taxing job I have ever had.

There's fights... There's drunks beyond anything you have seen out in public before... There's drugs right behind your back at all times... There's perverts... There's a ton of old men, with retirement money that don't have anything better to do with it than drink at the Longshot... Which by the way ""is the best bar in town... BY A LONGSHOT!"" How clever. 

I work Friday mornings, which I like, regulars all day, they are sometimes rude but for the most part they are conversational, not hammered yet, and are generally pretty sweet old men. They bring me flowers, food and silly gifts. Come with stories and jokes that they know will make me laugh or that I'm interested in what they have to share.
Until you get a few rowdy ones that are snorting coke all day out back - off the property - so I have no control over it. But to see some of these nice guys kill themselves like they do is so hard.&nbsp; A relationship with these older guys forms, its unavoidable...&nbsp; Although this is something that brings me down, it has nothing on what I dealt with last night...


I get hit on. Hands down. I get asked to have affairs, to be a date, or pretty much just be eye candy on the beach with some of these men. I laugh it off and walk away, take it as a compliment -- there is no other way to handle the situation... They make beer bets on my weight, bra size and comment on my ""bubble butt""... All this I can handle, they know when they cross the line and quickly apologize... I am the one that gives them their beer and therefore am not someone they want to piss off. There are some guys in there that are extremely protective of me -- anyone gets out of line, these particulars will have them by the collar and out the door in a blink of an eye - &lt;3 thank god for these men.

Last night, if it wasn't for one friend, my age, who I met once upon a summer beach bonfire, I could have been in a ton of trouble. Seral is not someone you would expect to be there for you, actually, you would think that he was the creepy one when you see his head still outside the bar 30 min after everyone has been booted out - last night was the same situation... I am not afraid of seral in any way, but I was praying that he was not going to try to hit on me when I finally left the place... 
****What I did not realize was that he was waiting for me and Ashley to get down because a man who was in the bar for my whole shift, staring at me, asking me if I like older men... if I wanted a new boyfriend... IF HE COULD LICK MY NECK!! Was fucking waiting for me right outside the door where you can't see from the windows... 
If Seral wasn't there who knows what could have happened to me.

I cried all night. 
I bought pepper spray today.
My safe little town... Doesn't feel so safe today."

then to be blunt - no sex... what the hell. your back for 2 days... its been awhile in the first place and now 2 more days of waiting (he just laughs and says, i like putting you through things you've never had to experience)...


I like what Leah told me last night when I had my girl breakdown - I don't need to be dating Eleventeen year olds. 

We both are really busy with my school and his work, we are exhausted at night and go straight to bed. No cooking dinner with each other, no adventures, no staying up late talking or kissing... And then he gets 2 days off and books it to Iron Wood, this weekend it right back to both of us working completely opposite schedules, he'll leave at 8am and I won't get home until 2:30am... 
I don't know how to tell him I need more affection. I don't know how to confront him about his probable lack of interest.

Wayde is staying in Marquette = me happy, but fuck... so hard to not get close, I want to but I know he's so scared. He's staying with me until he finds a house with some kids, which has led me to spend a lot of time on campus in the library and at the bar... The places he doesn't want to go or can't go - I can't risk him getting sick of me because I haven't had my chance yet. But in turn, my bar habits (though they aren't too often because of my damn school schedule) are probably going to push him away anyways. 

Then there is the fact that when it rains it pours... when you aren't looking for a guy, they all tend to flock to you. And it makes you think 'what ifs' and ponder if you are spending your time right. This was a minor thought, until a little birdie told me not to give up with all sincerity, this birdie knows things I don't, and I trust this birdie 100% with almost anything (except maybe things made out of glass or anything physically fragile for that matter). Wayde went to Iron Wood for a grad party this weekend - I was pumped at first because he needs to see his friends and get that cute butt away from the xbox... I was getting my bed to myself for the weekend! YES! 
~Last night, I didn't sleep... When I did, I dreamt he was calling me and would wake up looking for my phone only to be disappointed. I had to have a body pillow next to me even though we don't really cuddle (its hot &amp; he's not clingy), I missed him so much, for one night that it gave me butterflies.

I know where I should be spending my time... right were I have been for the past month. Getting to know one of the most interesting men I have ever met. Hoping that he finds me just as intriguing."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There once was this toad, and he wasn't an ordinary toad... This toad was baby blue... and he wasn't slimy but really silky. He really likes to wear little pink shirts with black ties... And that was his problem, the girl toads weren't into that ""human scene"" look.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were all like ""bitch, why you gotta do that faggity ass scene shit, huh?"" And they would always ask to go fists to cuffs with him, but you see, this toad was a bad ass because of his kick ass scene look. So he would always battle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when he would go to battle, the ghetto thug hard ass would come out in him and he'd pull out&nbsp; his bling-diamond studded brass knuckles that said ""BRING IT ON"" and all the other toads would run away. Until one day...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He meet this lady toad and man was she a bad ass. She could throw down just as hard and as fast as any dude toad and while throwing down, she never wrecked the scene explosion that was the back of her little toad head. So any ways...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a sweet septum piercing and the dude toad (lets say his name was Chet) went to jack her in the face... You would never believe it but his ""G"" on the brass knuckles got stuck on her nose piercing (Toads have noses??)... So they were stuck together and his baby toad fingers swelled up from frustration so he couldn't pull his hand out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a good thing though, because chic toad totally had this crazy finger fetish (yeah, I know... Toads get turned on?). So she was all excited and didn't know what to do with herself but try to kick Chet the toad for trying to fuck her shit up. She hurt him so badly that...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He collapsed on her and passed out. She looked around and no one was watching... She looked at Chet and his sweet pink shirt was adding to her horniness as his fingers laid limp on her face. So she rubbed his baby blue nips and fucked his passed out toad body and had the best orgasm of her life. She fell instantly in love with Chet... But how would he feel about her because she just knocked him the fuck out?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, luckily Chet was totally turned on by any chick toad that could knock his ass out. So when he came to, he had the biggest raging toad hard on - it was effin sweet. They were totally into each other, so they started this rad...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schedule of going to hard core shows and moshing hard and beating on each other hard... Then going into a local toad-absent pond and having raging ""you fucking hit me in the face"" anger sex, then laying there for hours, staring at the rising sun. One day, they were chillin with some new chill toads that were all smiley and huggy - Chet and his lady were a little confused by this until these new toads went and got them some funny tasting O.J. Everything started to make sense about this strange crowds actions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The O.J. had crazy amounts of E crushed into it. So the two hard core toads turned into these crazy E-Tards and techno fucks. It was a totally different scene then what they were used to and chic toad got pissed because she had to smooth down the explosion in the back of her head but if it meant she could get all the O.J. she wanted, she was all for it. And soon all the toads traveled to a crazy...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, after months of forgetting the scene look, Chet was digging in his messy toad hole for his new parachute pants and he came across his long forgotten pink shirt and black tie... So he decided to wear it for a day just for kicks. Well, Sun-baby (his lady's new name) wasn't down with that so they got into a verbal brawl. Then they decided to split because Chet missed the scene and Sun-baby totally didn't - She totally dug her new tongue piercing more than the long gone septum ring. So Chet went his own way and Sun-baby went along with the late-night, bright light filled glow stick lifestyle.






This is one of those, write a paragraph and pass it on... between Leah and myself, one late night years ago - I randomly stumbled across it this weekend, totally by accident when Leah happened to be visiting. Everyone laughed when we decided to present it to my friends -- If you were so unfortunate to actually read that entire masterpiece, I apologize and hopefully it made you giggle... if not, I assure you, you probably at least shook your head once. haha.

It once was a hoppin' mining town, along with Bessemer, Iron Wood, and Wakefield - But Hurley was the place to be, at one point in time there were over 100 bars along Silver st. Now theres 2 blocks of door to door bars and... strip clubs. Yup, I dropped a stripper on her head when she tried to flip off the stage onto my face. this is after the strippers. &lt;3.<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/absolute_troop/pic/0000rz52/""><img width=""178"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/absolute_troop/pic/0000rz52/s320x240"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/absolute_troop/pic/0000txgg/""><img width=""178"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/absolute_troop/pic/0000s6es/s320x240"" /><img width=""178"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/absolute_troop/pic/0000txgg/s320x240"" /></a><br />I continue to love my life :)"

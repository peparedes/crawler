"event","Ok,so its boyfriend season again at West Albany High School. When boyfriend season comes, its like track jacket season. Everybody has one, and the losers who dont, want one extremely bad! I am one of those losers. Well, I have a track jacket, but not a boyfriend. grrrrrrrr why? why me? what is wrong with me? Is it the meer fact that almost 99.9% of the guys at my school are shallow? I dont know what they wouldn't like me for if it was cuz they r shallow. But what is wrong with me? LA! I am very confused right now. boo hoo. I need Landon from A Walk to Remember. He just seems perfect. Shane West, will you go out with me? NO! Because u have a girlfriend!"

"event","I spent the night at Sarah's last night.
Mandy came over too.
We watched the Ring.
I was very proud of myself that I didn't get scared.
Mandy had to leave.
We chatted online with JOE KISSELBURGH and Adam for about 2 hours.
We watched the best of Will Ferrel.
We went to bed.
We woke up and ate pizza and drank pop.
We got on the computer and made a hawt playlist.
I had to leave.
I miss her already lol.
I will get to see her at school tomorrow.
It shall be joyful.
Not the school part though.
ta ta

"event","Hello
I feel very used right now. So when everyone else, like my friends at school, found out that I was working at the Falling Up concert, they all the sudden got interested in working also. So I thought hmmmm why is everyone so interested in working all the sudden? Then I realized, HA! They're using me! Those little weasels! grr I was very frustrated. I think that I am over it now though. ttyl!"

"event","Sarah! oh my goodness. What a great day to be sick you lucky goose! Today was the most boring day EVER I think! Drew said that you were hot today! I'll tell you the rest of the story in person because I don't want to tell the whole world. Anyways, so as I was falling asleep in class today, I got really excited all of a sudden because I realized that my birthday is coming up.Not so soon, but like 4 months. And then I got to thinking about how fun me and Sarah's party will be (if we have one) It was a very delightful time for me so I just thought that I would share that with everyone.Sarah, if you read this, get better soon. we might bring you cookies later but im not sure yet:)
I'm gonna go now have a b-e-a- utiful rest of the day!"

"event","Ok so I am extremely confused about what I am doing and my profile thing lokks ugly and yeah. Sarah and Kristen both forced me to get this ( well they didnt FORCE me) so I have it now  I have no idea what else to say other than I really dont want to go back to school tomorrow because I have to do a speech and I am deathly scared of public speaking. So if I die tomorrow, I wont talk toya later but I am hoping that I make it out of that class at the end of the day. 
love Britt"

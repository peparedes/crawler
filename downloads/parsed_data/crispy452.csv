"event","well i was wondering when he was going to show up. so i was in my room after class blowing my nose and he appears by the door and knocks. im frozen and cant say anything. he asked about gaggie and i said she was feeling better. good thing steph showed up and broke the tension. i got up and said i need to pee. i stayed in the bathroom for a longer time and when i was coming out i see him walking away down the hallway. i felt bad to i got my phone and my keys and walked after him. i yell through the window...he stops and i see him. ""i thought u didnt want to talk to me"". i stand there...sigh...and give him a hug...were in the middle of the fucking street and i push him away cuz he wont let go. i smile and walk away. fuck. 

this song fucking sums it all up:

My happy ending

So much for my happy ending 
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... 

Let's talk this over 
It's not like we're dead 
Was it something I did? 
Was it something you said?
 
Don't leave me hangin'
In a city so dead 
Held up so high 
On such a breakable thread 

You were all the things I THOUGHT I knew 
And I thought we could be 

You were everything, everything that I wanted 
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it 
And all of our memories, so close to me, just fade away 
All this time you were PRETENDING
So much for my happy ending 
So much for my happy ending

You've got your dumb friends 
I know what they say 
They tell you I'm difficult 
But so are they 
But they don't know me 
Do they even know you? 
All the things you hide from me 
All the shit that you do 

You were all the things I thought I knew 
And I thought we could be 


It's nice to know that you were there 
Thanks for ACTING like you cared 
And making me feel like I was the only one 
It's nice to know we had it all 
Thanks for watching as I FALL
And letting me know we were done 


So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending"

"event","well i went to my old high school today with my friend kathy. my brother dropped me off at her house and we drove to SLA (saint lawrence academy) in her beemer....gosh..what a rich bitch..haha..anyways when we got there i got to see all my old teachers and my old friends. i promised i would go to their graduation but i think im going to vegas that week...oh well we'll see. its not like i can do anything in vegas anyways...ok maybe walk around and see the lights..haha...how lame...but still kinda want to go. 

i saw a bunch of my old friends. PANDA (who's real name is alex) doesnt look like a panda anymore. he hella lost weight and looks like an anorexic panda to me. oh well. i hung out in his french class and it took the teacher 10 minutes to even realize that she didnt know who i was so i left. we were supposed to get vistors passes but who the hell cares. 

oh so the weird thing that happened was the same day i visit is the same day that freddie comes to visit. he just came back from hawaii. he said he came back on the 18th...and we started talking...i wanted to say ""we should hang out"" but i didn't..i was waiting for him to say it but he didnt either so whatever...i havent seen him for like a year now anyways. 

AND i saw ivan flirting with some girl...he didnt say hi to me but i dunt care...i think im over him....i think....but he's so cute now...omg..who cares...

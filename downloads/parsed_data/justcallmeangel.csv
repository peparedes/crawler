"event","so the summer seems to be going by WAY too fast, yet at the same time each day sort of drags on.  I guess it's funny how that works sometimes.

it's getting to be about that time again where i just type and don't pay attention to what i'm typing.  i have some things i definately need to get out somewhere...hmmm...bottled up thoughts are never good things in my case.

WORK: 60-70 hours a week will mess with your head... in other news...
Lately i have been dying/highlighting a few people's hair with happy results.  (note to self: continue to look into going to cosmetology school once graduated).

I have been going to other stores to work and the GM's at 2 other stores want me to go work for them.  On top of that, I got 3 nice comments from Betsy who in the past has made me feel like crap every day i come to work.  So yay for me...i think that's saying something?

I'm considered one of the fast/good people at my second job (Target) and me and the other girl who's good talk all kinds of crap about the people we don't like.  for some reason, at 4-8am this is incredibly good times.

I need to go get a passport ASAP for my trip to England.  WOOOO...scared yet excited at the same time.  I definately need to do some ""teacher clothes"" shopping sometime soon.

RELATIONSHIPS:
boys will never cease to confuse the crap out of me.  no further comments on this at this time.

doing kinda crappy in the ""friends"" category.  I heard on the radio a few days ago that 1:4 people consider themselves friend-less.  That was kind of a sad statistic.  Maybe all those people without friends need to meet each other.  i feel as if i have a few close friends that i can (and do...those of you who are included in this category know this!!!!) tell anything to, so i guess that's better than having a lot of ""so called friends"" who never talk to you or are never there for you.




thanks to everyone who's been helping me get thru life the past couple months.  i realize how crazy/bitchy/whatever you want to call it i was for quite some time.  i think i'm starting to come out of that phase, so that's good news.


this entry wasn't nearly enough as honest/deep/insiteful as i had hoped to make it. i never was good at putting things into words...hmm.

anyway, hope everyone out there in computer land is doing well catching up on people's lives.  Hope this helps for anyone who was interested."

"event","Now to some, the concept of getting in the car and driving for no reason is slightly ridiculous.  To me, it meant i got to sing to myself, dance in my car, and just go.  It was actually quite relaxing and the sunshine was beautiful.  I got to think about life (don't you do this every weekend driving? you might ask?) well no.  I think it being light out helped me think and not simply focus on staying awake....anyway.  I just decided to drive and see what Michigan north of Mt Pleasant has to offer (which turns out, is not a lot).  But i did find a mini-golf place and a pretty nice state park.  

The point of this journal is to just say that today I enjoyed life.  

And it didn't matter that on my way back from my random drive i lost $76 at the Casino.  I saw it as a donation to the Indians.  They deserve it, right?  That and last time i was there I won $225...so i figure I owed them a little.

I also decided that I need to find out information about cosmetology school and have a goal/focus/direction in my life so i have something else to work for/look forward to now that school is almost done.  I will be here for only a few more months before going home for the summer never again to go to CMU:)  Student teaching should be a good experience, especially going to England, but once that's done it will be hard to find a job mid-year...so cosmetology school and substitute teaching?  hmmmm....

It's all possible.  And for once, i'm not scared to let my wall down, get my hopes up, and live life :)"

i am becoming the biggest bitch on the face of the planet, and you know why?  because i'm building a wall.  berlin can't top this shit.  if you don't let anyone in, then you can't get hurt. and you know what? i think that's the way i like it. 

fuck fake friends and people that only like you for who you pretend you are. i don't even know ""who i am"" anymore. i know that i like to act how people expect or the way people like.  but it's not gettting me anywhere. i've never been so empty feeling and depressed my whole life.

my feelings on life show in my hands.  they break out when i'm stressed, and my body even shakes at times.  my strep throat is awesome.  why?  because it makes my whole body hurt, which is excellent.  i love not eating.  throwing up blood was pretty cool.  most people would take this as a hint to maybe sleep a little more, learn to relax.  fuck that.  the word relax is not even in my vocabulary anymore.  i'll eliminate that one just like i did the word sleep.  it's not something i do well without crying before doing it or with the help of an alcohol-induced passout.

instead of playing with my heart every time i talk to you, just be honest with me so i can work on getting over you, please?  because carving your name in my thigh every few days isn't exactly mentally stable.  Am i just the new Amanda, who i notice is talking to you again?

Here's a song that makes me cry every time i hear it....as well as scream it outloud when i'm alone and punch the steering wheel when driving.

I will not make
The same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
(((Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid))) <-------(((mostly this part)))

Because of you
Because of you"

"event","Checklist for self-destruction:

1. Brood. Allow your worst fears, past or present, to control you. Spend an hour or two thinking about all the emotional pain, disappointments, harassment, and failures until you are overcome completely.

2. Wallow in self-pity. You are the victim, the underdog, the unappreciated disgruntled employee, the neglected and abused wife, the misunderstood friend, the overlooked sibling, the forgotten parent. Blame everything and everyone else but yourself for your misery.

3. Stay in a state of inertia. Do nothing. Allow the forces in your life to control you. You are powerless against domineering individuals/situations. Without a say on your personal happiness, you simply let others dictate to you how you should live your life.

4. Pop a sleeping pill. Make it your best friend. By making it part of your regular regimen, your problems will temporarily fade away and not have the power to hurt you--for a short while.

5. Give in to your addictions and cravings. Don't do anything in moderation. Let drugs, alcohol, sugar, caffeine, fatty/junk food and carbohydrates rule your life.

6. Make time your enemy. Run against it, instead of with it. Stay out every night. Give yourself only three hours of sleep daily. Workaholism, all-night partying, all-day shopping are your feel-good therapies.

7. Do not exercise. Do not lift a finger and engage in any form of activity. That includes physical workouts, mental and spiritual pursuits. Do not go to the gym or walk in your neighborhood, read a book or meditate and pray.

8. Ban levity from your day. Smiles, humor or laughter are taboo. Let nothing amuse you. Be cranky. Let anger reign. Long faces are in. Snap at everyone within striking distance. Spare no one. Take no prisoners. Take your frustration out on your family, co-workers, and household help.

Inflate your smallest difficulty and turn it into a crisis. Magnify your issues and hold everyone hostage to your fears. Imagine the headache becoming a silent stroke, the palpitation a heart attack, the benign cyst a malignant tumor. Announce to the world that you are sick and use it as an excuse to withdraw from life.

9. Do not give thanks. Thanksgiving is alien to you. All the goodness and blessings that you have received and continue to receive should not be given any value. You believe that it is God's obligation to you and you are entitled to whatever you get.

10. Do not love. Hang a ""do not enter"" sign on the door of your heart. Keep it closed and unfeeling, and pretend to the rest of the world that you can live without it. Sacrifice your happiness to your ambitions."

"event","Blah!  I feel like an overly dramatic emo kid...hmm.

So it seems like everyone is in the ""I have no friends boat"" right along with me.  It made me realize that it's not that we don't have friends, just don't have the time like we had in the past to see those friends.  Over the summer, I propose a BBQ of sorts at Dodge Park, maybe get one of those big sub things?  I dunno, but whatever it is, you're all invited!!!! 

Based on the fact that not many people made it to the jello fight last year, I'm thinking about doing this instead on July 31st?  It's the annual day of the jello fight=easy to remember :)  Hopefully more people will be able to go/want to go since there's no sticky mess.  And maybe i'll bring some jello there anyway and then we can all play volleyball in the sand, cuz let's face it, it's just a good idea!  (sarcasm, sarcasm, sarcasm).

Anyone have any other fun ideas for big group outings?  My mom's not really into having a bunch of people in my house (and there's nowhere to put them anyway)."

"event","car accident...blah...

hit one of those big huge metal guard rail things with the front right side of my bumper.  Lost control of the car on some rumble strips which made my car spin around a few times, started heading straight for the thing, felt like i was about to die, somehow just barely knicked it, breaking my headlight and denting the right side fender.  How it hit the right side and nothing on the left, i don't know, i'm just glad that the brakes (and the grass in the wheels probably) stopped me in time to not continue moving heading into oncoming traffic!


So, uh...other than that, just glad to be alive!"

i'm so sick of crying myself to sleep!

i just want to go outside in the middle of nowhere, and just start screamming fuck, ass, shit, piss, and all the other bad words at the top of my lungs.  


I apologize in advance for being a huge bitch to anyone i talk to in the next few days.  At least my test today went well, can't wait for the 2 i have on thursday! (Thumbs down).


I really just need to get away from home and Mt. Pleasant soon.  I can't wait to go visit Jamie at Grand Valley next week!  I don't even care what we do, we could just sit there and stare at the wall for all i care...i MISS MY REAL FRIENDS!!!!"

"event","So my car pretty much sucks, so i'm getting rid of it.  I'm thinking about getting a mitsubishi eclipse, but some people say it's too ""conformist""...other thoughts are a toyota celica or a honda accord coupe or insight.  My sister works for GM and i can can get a discount because of that, but i really just don't most of the cars they're making.  Maybe the Cobalt?

Blah, here's to spending more money!  YAY!  not.  But it will be nice to have a car that actually works that doesn't just randomly break down, piss you off, and cause you to miss class.

On a better note, only a few more weeks of class.  Good deal cuz i just don't feel like going anymore.  Summer will be boring, just working....maybe i'll get a second job, cuz i think we all know i really wouldn't know what to do if i actually had FREE TIME over the summer?!?!

Thinking about dying my hair again, just can't decide on what color this time...any suggestions?"

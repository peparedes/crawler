Disclaimer: 
1. I don't really add anyone whom I know in real life, unless I trust you wholeheartedly. 
2. My journal is full of bitching and whining about my life, mental issues and how I deal with them. 
3. If you're on my friends list, it shows that I've placed my trust in you. If I ever found out anyone breeching that, I'll probably do something nasty to you."

"event","blood ties is the WORST movie in 2009 in my opinion. a horrible story plot, with scenes repeating agin & again and my friend & i went out of the cinema cursing that we've wasted $6.50 on a stupid movie. -.- it's no wonder i've never enjoyed watching movies in cinemas, cos it's such a waste of my time & money to watch a stupid movie."

Wow, I made a promise for 2010 to make at least one post a month. Sorry I didn't keep that. :/

Things can get busy when you're enjoying stuff. In the time sense I have played a ton more video games (Current Xbox gamerscore: over 63k!), watched a ton of movies, partied with a ton of friends (or just chilled and played some games).

Life has been quite busy, although it seems like a lot of that is just me assing around and playing Xbox. :/

My goal for 2012 is to actually do a post a month. Those of you who are friends with me on other websites *cough cough* Facebook *cough cough* make sure to force me to keep this promise, LOL.

In my last entry I mentioned Final Fantasy XIII. I went on to one hundred percent that game in almost exactly 80 hours. It was really fun, but a bit too easy. At the end of battle theres a stats screen that shows your quickest battle. Mine was zero seconds. Thats right, the battle started and I instantly wiped the enemies. Suck it, Square-Enix, LOL.

Also, ironically enough, at the end of next month, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is coming out. I plan to beat this of course, too, and have preordered limited special edition (I did the same with Mass Effect 3, and will also do so for Borderlands 2 when it gets announced).

Aside from newer games, I have had the urge lately to replay some of my favorite FF games. Probably gonna start with 8, because I have the urge to play Triple Triad again.

Anywho, i'll jump on back in here in a few days to see whats going on. Later folks!"

"event","As promised, a little over a month has passed since my last entry, which was probably uncomfortably long for some. Its my hope by posting at least one entry a month (maybe a few double entries along the way), that I can trim these down throughout the year.<br /><br />If you ever read my journal on its main page, you've probably noticed my layout is gone. Unfortunately, this is true. Not that I didn't like it anymore, I still liked it, it's just since I don't have Paid LJ anymore, I can't update it at all, and the info on it was way outdated (It stated I was 20. I havn't been 20 in along time).<br /><br />As such, I picked out one of the new LJ layouts to use for now. It's similar to the one Nai-chan uses, so I kind of dig it. Oh, and yeah, it's pink. I am totally rocking this. :D<br /><br />Anyways, last February I moved in to a new place, and I took some pics and posted them around. Nothing really crazy. I promised you guys some pics last entry, so those will be in this.<br /><br />Instead of going through and posting them, you can just check out my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/majindustin/"">Flickr profile</a>. On the left you'll notice it says Me and Room. These should be obvious, so check 'em out.<br /><br />I actually made some new icons, too, and removed some old ones. Made a few of me, actually, too. First time in along time. I also did a Black and White version of one that I really dig.<br /><br />I havn't played much of Final Fantasy XIII, but I do enjoy it. To be honest, it does feel very linear, but I am still enjoying it. I've only gotten a little under an hour in it. Reason being is that there is nothing else really on my game platter until late April. I am certainly in no rush. I Gamefly'd it because I don't have a PS3 yet, so I am playing the less visually amazing Xbox 360 port. The differences are noticeable, excepting during CGI's, which are just videos, anyways. Data is data, in that aspect. I did purchase the Strategy Guide, though. Collectors Edition. It's probably the best guide I have ever seen (and I also have the Collectors Edition for XII). Hard cover, nicely bound, beautiful art work and high res graphics. Spoiler free walkthrough. These are gonna be rare, too. They only made 210,000 world wide. I got number 22,474, which is amazing considing the situation I went through to get this.<br /><br />Originally, I was going to order it from Amazon.com, but I forgot to throw my Preorder in before they stopped accepting them. Someone told me Walmart.com had it, so I went that route. Including shipping it came to about $25. Not bad at all. A few problems, though. I did the preorder the last day of Feb, the day before I got paid. So my account was just &quot;blah&quot;. I also didn't know I was overdrawn already due to something with my Gamefly account. Long story short, I faced the charge for the Walmart.com order, and two seperate overdraft fees the next day. Ouch. My own fault for not checking it, though. Although, they weren't supposed to charge me for it until it shipped. I shrugged it off, because at least I was getting it.<br /><br />The day before it came out, Monday the 8th of March, I got an email from Walmart saying my order was canceled and my money refunded. I was furious, but had no choice but to accept it. Gamestop was the only place with any left, but I didn't have enough cash, so I threw down a order with Amazon.com for the regular guide. They were temporarily out of stock, and it would take a few days to ship. Early Friday morning I get an email from Walmart.com telling me they had an error in their system and that my guide had already shipped and I was charged for it. They even sent me a tracking number (It wound up arriving later that day). I was able to quickly cancel my Amazon.com order, luckily enough. So, long story short, it was a pain in the ass to get, but I am glad I did. This guide is PURE quality. The pages are very thick, too, though. The guide is physically unable to be left up, it'll close itself, because the pages are so thick.<br /><br />Amazing stuff.<br /><br />Anyways, its late, and I need to sleep. Me and some friends are probably gonna go see Alice in Wonderland tomorrow, and I need to buy some new shoes. Later guys. :D<br /><br /><strong>EDIT: Thursday March 18th, 2010 at 1:20&nbsp;AM.</strong><br /><br />Long day, had fun with friends. Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland was great. We saw it in 3D, which was kind of a trip, since it played hell on my eyes.&nbsp;Excellent movie, though.&nbsp;Gonna see it again in 2D, it was so good.<br /><br />Also, changed my layout again to something more simplistic, and easier for me to read. I dig the color scheme, too. :D"

"event","So, only one post in all of 2009 and it was mostly just a hardcore ""fuck you"" to Kamen Rider Decade. Yeah, i'm awesome like that. But, who cares. I talk to most of you on other sites, like Facebook and Myspace. There are also some of you I chat with on Xbox Live.

I'm mostly posting this because I have set a small goal for myself to post at least one post a month this year. I have clearly already failed, but thats because I didn't start this goal until a few days ago when I realized I hadn't posted in a long time. Somewhere down the road I will make a second post in a month. I havn't quite decided which month, yet, so look forward to that surprise.

2009 was a pretty good year. A little bit better than 2008, certainly, but definantly not worse, even. Wow, that was very roundabout if I do admit myself.

Anyways, quick versions of whats gone on recently, and most of what happend last year (ya know, in that post I promised to make back in September?).

I moved out of my old place into a new one thats much bigger (Pics forthcoming, possibly).

Went to another concert. Making this a yearly thing with my friends. Got completely ripped the night before the concert, got a late start, got stopped by the cops for speeding (first ticket, actually), barely made it to the concert. Also, some guy smuggled in a bunch of weed and lit it up near the ventilation system. 

I don't think anyone walked out of there that wasn't high. Oh, and it was DragonForce, again. This venue was alot smaller (roughly a couple thousand people there), but it was a lot better than when I saw them in 08. I knew it was gonna be fun when they brought out a fucking trampoline.

Took up Bass. It's a work in progress, but I can play quite a few songs, just by reading the tabs and practicing for a bit. Learned a lot of Led Zeppelin's stuff.

Built a new PC for myself, which I am using right now. It's hooked into my HDTV. Runs a quad core 3.6ghz AMD Phenom II processor, four gigs of ram, all the good stuff. Runs like a dream, plus I can watch HD vids off the net on my TV. Anime is good, but watching Full metal Alchemist in 720p is the only way I can watch it now.

Actually decided last year to watch another Super Sentai series, Samurai Sentai Shinkenger. It's ending this week, so I am kinda sad to see it go, but it should be good. Also started Kamen Rider W, which is still going. It's pretty cool, too. They recently added a Kamen Rider that turns into a motorcycle. Very transformers-ish.

Anime wise, I can't think of much that wow-ed me last year. FMA Brotherhood is a given, though. Oh, and Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, which is actually a spin-off of the Tenchi Muyo GXP series, and deals with Tenchi's younger brother (whom his father had with Reia (from the third OVA series), Kenshi, being mysteriously transported to another world, and trying to find a way back. It's been very good so far. Each episode is a double length OVA, so when its done with episode 13, it'll be the equivalent of 26 anime episodes. 

Aside from these two, not alot of wowing going on. I had high hopes for both Fairy Tail and Dance in The Vampire Bund, but so far, pretty standard stuff. Dance was disappointing, though, since it deviates alot from the manga. It's times like these that I can go back and watch stuff I missed, or rewatch stuff, which is how I got in to Heroic Age, which is pretty damn good (check it out, theres a ton of info around the net on it).

The Gamer in me is mostly pissed at last year, since a ton of the games I wanted got pushed back due to Modern Warfare 2. I gave the game a shot, and I wasn't impressed. When I mention this on Xbox Live people ask me what is wrong with me, LOL. I don't feel the need to suck the games balls like everyone else. As far as sequels go, I thought Left 4 Dead 2 was much better, by comparison. But, even then, neither really improved on a lot. However, adding in more Special Infected, melee weapons, and a bunch of fun modes made L4D2 a winner to me.

Some more quick thoughts from last year. Resident Evil 5: Didn't play it because the control scheme of the demo pissed me off (this is supposed to be better than 4, not worse, right?). Also, the local multiplayer screens pissed me and my friends off. When a patch comes out to make it not play like Nemesis, I'll get it.

Street Fighter 4: It's Street Fighter, all you need to do is use Sagat and spam his Tiger Uppercut, right?

Blaz Blue: I love this game, but even I can admit it's like playing a new version of Guilty Gear. I'm calling this right now: Guilty Gear vs Blaz Blue. It'll happen.

Guitar Hero Metallica: The title says it all. I literally had to buy this, day one.

Batman: Arkham Asylum and Wolverine: Very few games based on comic book characters are actually good. For two of them to be released in the same year, and have both of them raise the bar is fucking amazing.

Halo Wars: Not impressed. Didn't purchase when I heard you couldn't play as Covenant.

Halo ODST: Meh, didn't enjoy it enough to care.

Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2: Fuck was this game hard. I think I have around 140 hours in it, and I am still only 75% done. Needless to say I shelved it to take a break. Fun as hell though, probably one of the best Gundam games (to hit America, anyways. We're never getting Operation Troy, I hear).

Modern Warfare 2 and Left 4 Dead 2: See above rant.

Borderlands: Probably the most fun I had in a game in a long time, and easily the best game I played last year. 17 million guns is not a lie. I've literally never picked two guns up that are exactly alike. The support the company has behind the game is amazing, too. A ton of DLC is already out, and they have more announced.

Now, for some newer stuff.

Bayonetta: Wasn't sure about this until I played the demo. Great game system, story is a bit confusing, so far. Plays better than DMC4, I think. I'll finish it when I am less busy.

Mass Effect 2: Excellent sequel. They actually did a complete overhaul on this, I was surprised how well it played and how much I enjoyed it. Still a lot of work to do in it, and its actually making me want to replay the first one over and over again to change things in the second one.

Bioshock 2: I think most people agree Bioshock didn't need a sequel. It's the third highest rated game on the Xbox 360, and was one of the best games the year it came out (winning multiple game of the year awards, and I considered it game of the year, too). I was a bit shocked at a sequel, but once I started playing it, I was happy. Some controls have changed, for various reasons, and they have added in a bunch of new stuff, including plasmid combining, dual wielding a plasmid and a weapon, etc etc. They made the game harder, too.

There are still a bunch of games in my back list that I just couldn't get too. I am so busy with real life things, too, that its sometimes hard to even get time to play some games. Although recently some friends and I have been LANing Left 4 Dead (and 2), which is always fun.

Anyways, this long ass post is likely to not be read by a lot of folks, but thats ok. Someone will get bored and read it, right?

Until next time. :D"

Decade had a fucking troll ending. Fuck that shit. Oh yeah, get to the final ultimate battle that the preceeding 30 fucking episodes have been leading up to then end it by saying ""LOOK FORWARD TO THE MOVIE IN DECEMBER"". FUCK YOU!

Double is pretty good, but that judgement is based on the single episode that is out. Still, enjoying it so far.

P.S. This is my first post this year. Don't feel to distraught. Alot of people don't seem to read so I hardly post.

In the last nine months of this year plenty has happend, and I may feel more forthcoming with that and post about it if people post comments showing interest, otherwise i'm not sure if I will be posting much.

Also, I said it on her journal already, but I want it posted here too.

Congratulations Reese on your engagement. :D"

First entry in five months, and its a short one. Probably do a larger one after the new year. It'll be too long, though, so maybe nobody will read it."

"event","I just finished watching Full Metal Alchemist - The Conqueror of Shamballa, aka the FMA movie.

You know what?

GOD DAMN WAS IT GOOD.

The down side is I have heard FUNimation isn't licensing the movie for a domestic release, and having watched it, I can tell why.

I'm not going to spoil the plot, but I will state that the movie deals with a certain time period in our history which we are not proud of, and, by todays standards, seeing would offend quite a few people. FUNimation probably doesn't wanna get their hands dirty with it.

The good news for me is, the R2 dvd has english subtitles, and I own a region free dvd player. I am DEFINANTLY going to get that dvd.

However, after watching this movie, I feel I must re watch the entire series and the movie again, just to get a better understanding of some things that happen in the movie.

Overall, the movie was good, however, the end leave something open. That's called a sequel. I am expecting the announcement any day now.

The movie was awesome. Its everything I would have expected it to be, and more. In short, it takes all the good things about the FMA series to a new level. Its simply brilliant.

Often times its hard for a movie based on an anime to do well without differentiating from the anime too much. This movie is seamless in comparison to the TV series. The look, the feel, the characters, all of it fits perfectly.

Its 4:38 AM, and I think I might just watch it again. :D

New update coming later!

Bye for now!"

Honestly, I feel like shit. The same way I felt when Owen died back in '99.

I'll most more later, since not a lot of people will probably care about this, nor know who Eddie or Owen are.

"event","First things first. I got a letter from Mandie. Her writing is.....wow. I thought mine was bad. She sent me a super cool hand drawn image. I carefully put it back in the envelope and put it in my special drawer. Which I only put important stuff into (So that it doesn't get broken, in this case, ripped or torn). Thanks again, Mandie! :D

Ok, I got my monthly check, paid my usual bills, and spent some money. I bought the Saw Uncut Edition special DVD. it has a cool case with a blood packet on it, so blood appears over the cover. Its an awesome two disc set.

Today I bought Resident Evil 4 for PS2. Havn't opened it yet, though. I'm gonna do it tomorrow, as I am tired right now.

I trick or treated Monday. I just wore some of my normal clothing, and used some black face paint to make some markings, then put on my Konoha headband. I was ""Random Konoha Ninja #317"". Some people actually knew what the headband was from, too. Got like four pounds of candy, and called it a night.

Well, I am sure I can think of more to say, but I am really tired, and I have been playing Dynasty Warriors on PSP almost all day (Seriously, the fucking PSP is overheating or something, so I had to turn it off for awhile), I have completed quite a bit in the game, so, that's cool. :D

That's my post, for now. TTYL.

EDIT: 
More to add before I pass out. The gameshop had a copy of Ultimate Spider-man come in for PS2 so I snagged it. I also snagged a copy of Dynasty Warriors 5. The guy who turned both these in (The same guy) didn't like them, after less then an Hours worth of play. So, I pretty much got brand new games, for less then retail. And I didn't even pay in cash. They also had a rare, damn near mint copy of Marvel vs Capcom come in for Dreamcast. I nabbed that gem, too.  Now I just need Marvel vs. Capcom 2 for Dreamcast, and perhapes PS2. Or just one or the other. Not sure yet. I have played it on both systems, and I am good with the game on both systems. Still, not sure which one I want it on.

Gotta love that gameshop. Brad let me borrow his copy of Kingdom Hearts since my file corrupted, so I started over. I've gotten to Alantica, so far. He also let me borrow God of War, but I have yet to play it (Since I also have FFVII borrowed from Brad), while Morgan let me borrow some Dreamcast games. I got Virtual-On, King of Fighters 2002, and Project Justice from Morgan to borrow. All of that, plus the games I bought for PS2, plus Dynasty Warriors for PSP, and Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls for GBA are seriously taking up a shit load of my time. In between all this, I find time to watch anime, surf the net, stay in touch with everyone, and play Halo 2.

On top of that, there are games I still want to buy. Soul Calibur 3 came out. I'm probably not getting it anytime this year. Burnout Revenge (Console) and Burnout Legends (PSP) came out, and I want those. I did get to play Revenge though, as a local video store has it for rent. Kris rented it and we played it as his place on his high def, that fucking game rules. Me and Kris both wanna get Legends to play against each other on PSP.

By the end of this year I will probably be playing WoW, Kris and Brad both play it and they seriously want me to join them. Morgan's working on getting a PC, so he can play aswell.

I am pissed about hearing that Kingdom Hearts 2 got pushed back, again. March 1st is the date I have seen now. It was supposed to be January 1st. Those fucktards.

In non-video game related personal news, I rented the first dvd to the first season of the TV show Lost, and watched the Pilot Episodes. Its fucking awesome. I still have two episodes to watch on the DVD, but I am pretty sure I wanna buy the season one set now.

Wow, this post is longer than I thought it would be. Oh, back on video game news, Kris did give me Blakc and White 2, but, being the lazy bastard I am, I havn't even installed it yet. Quake 4 came out, I want it, but can't get it. Not for awhile at least.

I am still actively seeking employment. There are not alot of jobs out here, and even less that I am capable of doing.

Check out Gametap.

Its a new PC program service. They allow you to download games through their program and play them right off of your PC. Games from all kinds of old systems, and some new games (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, for example). The best thing is, there is a free two week trial. I've already registered my account and am going to play some games tonight.

As I said, theres a two week free trial, and every month after that, they are $14.95 a month.

I first heard about this watching an episode of Attack Of The Show on G4, and now I have seen a few commercials on Adult Swim.

I gotta say, this is a cool idea, and it works great.

Check it out at <a href=""http://www.gametap.com/home/Home"">Gametap.com</a>

EDIT: OMG this is so much fun. I've been playing games for hours. I even tried out Splinter Cell, but I don't like it. The game itself is cool, I just hate that I can't use my gamepad for it. I'll check out Pandora Tomorrow though, maybe that'll allow my Gamepad.

I recommend this to everyone. Highly."

"event","If, in the last hour, certain events had unfolded differently, I wouldn't even be here typing this post, and none of you would ever hear from me again.

Here's what happened.

My uncle has blown the engine in his car, which kinda sucks, because it had excellent gas millage, like 40 miles a gallon, plus it was a Toyota Corolla AE86 Hatchback. In case I need to make anything clear for the Otaku reading this who know what I mean, yes, its pretty much the same damn car from Initial D, except without the tuning.

Anyways, he blew the engine, so he asked me if he could borrow my truck to go to work. This I couldn't do, because my sleeping habits changed recently, and I would be awake whilst he was at work and would need to go places. Most of all, to go to the video store and rent Batman Begins, since I cannot afford to purchase it. Anyways, I offered to take him to work instead, and he agreed.

We left home and took him to work, I dropped him off and started pulling away a little bit quick. Then the steering froze in place. I didn't have enough time to slow down very much, so I hit the brakes and turned as much as I could. I was a few feet away from t-boning my truck around a huge tree (I live near a national forest, and my uncles work is just a mile or so away, still national forest).

I put it in park and turned the truck off. I thought I must have hit something, so I got out and looked under, I didn't see anything, so I locked the truck up and walked back to my uncles work and got him aswell. He told me to give him the keys and that we would drive it back to his work so he could look under it. However, it was still dark out, so he couldn't get a good look (He said he'd look at it later), but, we both believe I hit an animal, a small one.

We could see, nor smell, any blood, though. My uncle believes I hit a Possum, and I agree.

The truck works just fine now, but my uncle still wants to check everything underneath and make sure its working, so he told me to go easy on the driving. On my way home I did notice a bit if difference in how it rides, but I think that was because of the road. I drove on a flat road, and let go of the wheel, it didn't drag to either side so its still perfectly tuned.

Thank god my reflexes are quick for a fat man, or I'd be dead.

Well, that's that story.

*puts it behind him now*

I might update on the truck later if anythings wrong, as far as I can see, it just fine. My truck is by no means made to run something over and break. Its a fucking Dodge, it'll last twenty years before dying on me. :D"

Ok. So, Yesterday was the season five opener. Me and Brad, being the only Smallville fans amongst my friends, did our usual thing, which is to hang out and watch it together. During commercials, we like to speculate and go on tangents about certain things, and trust me, we enjoyed this new episode. Next weeks is one we look forward to, greatly.

Secondly....wait, wtf was second again?

"event","Today was a great day, I believe.

Probably the best day I have had this year, without anything going wrong.

I woke up today and, as usual, everyone was gone. My Old man was fishing, as he usually does, while my Uncle was at work, as he, too, usually does.

I expected that, having woken up at three in the afternoon, as I usually do. I microwaved some leftover A&W food, a double cheeseburger (Mayo and Ketchup only), and some Onion Rings. I drank the last of my Tiki Punch soda as I ate and watched ""Hogan Know's Best"" on VH1. It was a new episode, and I was slightly intrigued as I ate, so I watched it. The show is a ""reality"" show about Pro Wrestler Hulk Hogan and how he tries to control every aspect of the lives of people around him. From his Son, who has a girlfriend that he spends ""too much time with"", according to Hogan, to Hogan's Daughter, a wanna-be Brittany Spears. Rounding it up his Hogan's wife, who at times seems to be the one in charge, while at others she doesn't. Honestly, The Osbournes was MUCH better.

So, as soon as I finished Lunch (Breakfast, whatever), I took a quick shower, got dressed and went into town. I went to the Gameshop because I am good friends with the guys that work there, Chadd and Richard. To my dismay, Chadd had already left for the day to go to the Pitch-N-Putt, where he freelance works a few weekends a month to get some discounted golf (More on that later). So I hung out with Richard, Jordan (Richards friend, they go to High School together) and Richards sister, Leslie (Also a high school student). It was a entertaining way to kill four hours. I realize now I should have taken my PS2 and hooked it up to their TV, that way we could have at least killed time trying to waste each other in Guilty Gear Isuka, which I got from the gameshop recently (Some idiot stuck this BRAND NEW copy in there after played for twenty minutes and said ""Having to push a button to turn around is SO GAY""), and have been having a fun time practicing with. So far, the best I have done is with Chipp, though I seem to also be amazingly good with Sol, for a newbie anyways. Jordan has Guilty Gear Isuka, and we talked a bit about it, he said I was better than he was, and hes had it for a few months. I do seem to be best at Fighting Games and Racing Game though.

So, we killed time at the gameshop until seven, which was closing time. Chadd stopped to make sure the plans for tonight (Saturday) were gonna go through. We were going to go to the Pitch-N-Putt and play night golf. I told him I was still in, and so did Richard and Jordan. Leslie didn't want to go, because she was broke. So we agreed to meet at Nine at the Pitch-N-Putt. I had to find a way to kill two hours, and fast. I didn't want to go all the way back home because it takes too much gas going back and forth in my Truck (which is a gas hog, dispite that, I still love it), so I decided to head over to the theater and see a flick. Everything started at Six, or around then, except one movie, which started at Seven Fifteen. So I went up and talked to Morgan (If anyone remembers my older posts, my friends Kris, Morgan, and Brad (All of whom are Otaku) work at the same movie theater, Kris is actually one of the owners, so occasionally I get to see stuff free) and paid for a ticket to see Sky High. I could have gotten in free, but Kris works weekends in Reedsport, a  town thirty miles south of where I live. Its also a small town, and Kris owns the theater there, which is only open on weekends. This weekend he is running War of The Worlds, I believe. So, Kris' uncle, Mark, is working at the theater today. Hes a pretty cool guy, in small doses.

I talked to Morgan for a minute as I bought my ticket and then proceeded to go inside. Mark was outside talking to his Sister and Mother in their Van, as he smoked a cigarette. Brad was working, which I knew, as he had stopped at the Gameshop at around Four. He said he had to meet someone before work, and I assumed he had a Date, of sorts. I couldn't get anything out of him besides ""Who would schedule a date an hour before they have to work?"". It was logical, but I still think somethings going on with that. I didn't question it further, and instead asked him he had finished Full Metal Panic yet, as I had loaned it all to him, aswell as all of Getbackers and the Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki OVA (Except OVA three, which he wants now). He said he had finished Full Metal Panic, and he enjoyed it. He said he couldn't get the last episode of Get Backers to work, so I guess next time hes over to hang out we have to watch it. I spent about another six minutes talking to Brad and Morgan as I bought a Large soda (Mug Root Beer/Mountain Dew mix). Morgan told me to head into the theater now, as he was gonna go start Sky High, so I headed in and took my seat. Left center row, back of the auditorium.

The movie started and I watched it. I wasn't expecting alot out of it, but I did expect to be entertained for the two hours I had to kill, and I was. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and its unique plot. I assumed Kurt Russell would be horrible in it (I havn't watched one of his movies that I have enjoyed yet), but he wasn't. He may have been the star, but they didn't shove him down your throat like they do other stars in other movies (There isn't even one TEN SECOND length in War of The Worlds that Tom Cruise DOESN'T appear in). The Plot was good, too. The son of the two greatest Super Heros in the world goes to Super Hero high school (Sky High) to learn to use his super powers to fight crime. The only problem, which he didn't tell his parents before he got in the bus to Sky High, he doesn't have any super powers. The movie had alot of laughs, some good action scenes, good special effects, and is all around a good movie for the first view. Repeated viewings may cause it to get worse each time, but I might actually watch this one again. I certainly thought it was better than Fantastic Four, even if Fantastic Four had more special effects. Interesting note, this isn't the first Disney movie to feature a Son of two world class super heros who has no powers. A made-for-tv movie by Disney a few years ago called ""Up, Up, and Away!"" was the first to feature said plot point. I thought this movie would just be a re-tooled version of that, but it wasn't. It was completely different even though there is a common basis.

So, I enjoyed the movie, and I watched the credits at the end because there was one of the super heros that stood out. The actor that played Warren Peace (Suppsed to be a Pun on War And Peace, because his mother was a super hero, while his father was a super villain, ironically enough put in prison by the protaganist's father) did an exceedingly good job. His power was the control of Fire (think Pyro from X-men 2, except this kid can also make the fire), and he played the part of the arch-enemy really well. While the movie does feature super heros and super powers in general as a main plot point, I was surprised to see how much they reinforced that the kids were students in a high school, and were teenagers in general. Angst, releationships, and hazing are abound in the halls of Sky High. The Protaganists best friend is a girl who also has liked him since Kindergarden, but, as usual with this things, he is too oblivious to notice it. He meets, and hooks up with the ""dream girl"" of the school (Complete with him ignoring things as music plays while he stares at her). This causes the best friend to try and make him believe that she is hooked up with Warren, even though Warren and the Protaganist have already had one run in, and the Protaganist almost got friend alive. All of this culminates at a School Dance, where everything ends. I won't say any more about the plot, but its a pretty good movie.

After watching the movie, I had a quick conversation with Brad in regards to the trailer for <a href=""http://www.narnia.com"">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</a>, which was supposed to be due out in December 9th. Having known of the film as being in production for some time, me and Brad were both looking forward to it, as we had both read the Narnia books. I hold The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe as my personal favorite. When I was younger, before I had read the book, I had seen the previous made movie about it. Made awhile ago by the BBC. Even though that version isn't as special effect heavy, it still remains faithfull. However, the new movie has the special effects to make the plot work in a more thorough way. The trailer had alot of stuff shown in it, including the children, but especially Aslan, the great Lion who is the ruler of Narnia. I also spoke, much briefer, about Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, out in November. He told me the movie was supposed to be a bit over two and a half hours long. I expected it to be long, but jeez. Mark told me that he heard they cut alot of the subplot down to make room for the main plot, and without that it would have been alot longer, and I gotta say I believe him.

After that, I jumped in the truck and drove to the Pitch-N-Putt, and arrived shortly before Nine. I went into the office, and Chad was there, along with his wife, Wendy. Richard and Jordan, aswell as some of Chadd's other friends, whom I really didn't catch the names of. Nine Golf was Ten bucks, which was good considering its usually 25 (Fifteen for Golf plus a ten doller deposit on the glow in the dark golf balls, luckilty we didn't lose any of them), plus we got some free glow sticks to wear. I snagged three of them, and put some on my Hat and made them stand up as if I was a demon. The others just wore them around their wrists, or ankles. We played our Nine holes, and overall, of seven people, I came in Fourth, having played my best game of Golf ever. Ironic that I played that well at Night. They hadn't officially opened Night Golf to the public and we were the testers, so after it was over, we gave out cerain suggestions. One of which was putting glow sticks on the cat the owners have. It runs around the golf course and chases people golf balls (His name is Mulligan). On the first hole, the said }Cat Hazard"" (I coined the term, and now they use it everyday there) came into play, as it chased Jordan's ball and stopped it from going any further. He went over to pet the cat, move it and get his ball, but Mulligan scratched the hell out of him. I went over to see, and sure enough, he was bleeding. Luckily the other cat (Bogey) was nice enough not to scratch Jordan as he pet her. Ironically, Jordan was the only one Mulligan scratched. Also ironic, Mulligan continued chasing and attempting to attack Jordan the rest of the night.

After a round of nine holes, I had to go, as it was after Eleven. Chadd asked me to give a ride to Richard and Jordan back to Richards, so I agreed. We had a cool five minute conversation as I took Richard home. Jordan got off there aswell, saying he was staying over, so I waved them off, and continued home. I pulled in, put the radio back on its precise setting (I am one of those people that has precise settings. If its different than what it usually is, it means someones driven my truck besides me. I use this to determine how much gas my Uncle/Old man need to put back in the tank), I locked the door as I got out, and activated the security system and went to the door, which was unlocked. As I walked in I noticed my Uncle and Old Man asleep on the couch, as they usually do. They woke up a minute after I entered and questioned me as to where I was the entire day. I reminded my Old man that I had previously told him I had Night Golf today and wouldn't be back until late. I used this time to also throw in how much good it would due to have my Cell phone working, since its my Old mans fault its not (I have two cell phones under my account, mine, which is paid off, and my Old mans, which is OVER DUE because he believes because he doesn't use it, he shouldn't have to pay for it). My Uncle got up and went to bed, as did my Old man, so I went to my room and booted the PC up, as I had it off all day.

I quickly went to eBay to try and find a Hardcover copy of Robert Kornwise and Piers Anthony book, Through The Ice. It was a book I had first read as a Freashman in High School, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The High School's copy was worn down, and I since I hadn't been in High School since I was sixteen, I decided to buy myself a copy while I could. At first I thought it only came in Paperback, because thats what the High School had, so I tried to get a Hardcopy, but no luck on finding a new one. I huffed a bit, because I knew that was the inevitable outcome. The hardback was published in 1989, while the Paperback was first published in 1992 (with later publishings up to 1994). So I googled the hell out of it to try and find a NEW copy of the hardback, no luck, so I went to Amazon to find a new copy of the paperback, and to my luck, I found one, for cheaper than Amazon had their's listed for. Aswell as Through The Ice, I picked up a hardcover copy of The Chronicles of Narnia, a 784 page book HarperCollins published last year that contains the entire C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia in one Hardbound book. It retailed for $29.99, but Amazon had it for $19.99, so I splurged and picked it up aswell. I had been intent on getting it anyways, as before the movie gets released, I want to re-read the books. I should be doing good on money this month, the only other purchase I intend to make this month is when Sin City comes out on DVD on the Sixteenth. I was debating waiting for the special edition I KNOW they will make (Every movie has a special edition DVD these days), but I figure I won't be able to rent it for my Old man and Uncle to see, so I might aswell Buy it. I can always sell it to a friend later to get some money for the Special Edition version.

After placing my Amazon.com order, I surfed around the net, checking my usual sites to see if any new anime/manga was release on the net that I am currently watching/reading. Aswell as checking the Anime news and other things like that. After that, I updated my Winamp to version 5.094 and began to type this post, which at this point has taken over an hour to complete.

That was my day in full. I am now going to finish this post, and go microwave some leftover Chinese for dinner because I am truely tired from not eating and doing all that walking on the Golf course. I'm pretty sure nobody will read this whole post and comment, but, hey, if anyone does read the whole thing, comment and let me know, you'll have my thanks eternally for caring about how my day went, and about my in general. :D

P.S. Awhile ago (Years ago) I wrote a DBZ fanfic that I never actually finished. Well, I did finish it later on, but, anyways. Last year at Kumoricon 2004 it won an award in the Fanfiction contest. I decided to reactivate my Fanfiction.net account and upload it for all to read. So, if you want to kill some time, and read it, <a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2500204/1/"">check it out here</a>. Its a fic about Future Trunks, and...well, there are Authors Notes posted, read those to see why I wrote the fic. Enjoy, all!

EDIT:
Today (Sunday) I saw Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and yes, it was awesome. I won't go into any detail because this post is quite long enough as it is, and most people tend to ignore long posts. I'm not one of them, I always read them, because I know they're impotant, or else why would they be long? Anyways, thats the end of the edit."

"event","So, after a lot of hard work on the graphics and coding from KayKay, my new layout is finally up.

I had waited on adding it until I did a lot of code perfecting, myself. Mostly with the friends page and having the user icons and community names and such show up.

The only small error is that community names show twice due to the fact that if I remove a certain code, they'll show ONCE, but then regular friends names won't show up.

Not a big problem to me, as I could really care less if they showed up twice. The first time it shows up, the name is unclickable, and isn't a link, so its kinda lame like that. I worked with the coding to see if I could make it link to the community, but it didn't work (and screwed up the entire pages coding).

So, oh well.

I still think it looks awesome, regardless.

This begs the question though. Was Ichigo's mother also a Shinigami?

If so, could she also see Grand Fisher that rainy day when she got Murdered by it?

Though, if both his parents where Shinigami, the fact that Ichigo can see ghosts and hollows easily is not at all surprising. Hell, Karin can see them just aswell, and I'm sure if she worked on it, Yuzu could too.

I see this story turning torwads that path. However, an interesting note. And I hope its not just me, but....does Grand Fisher have a fucking Shinigami Soul Slayer on his back?

Recently, having been annoyed at myself for being too busy to finish it, I have started reading Angel Sanctuary again, and my new layout is a tribute to the awesome story.

Read it, all of you, I command it.

Are you reading it yet?

That's the quickest I have ever changed my layout. Though, I might bring back the Ichigo layout sooner or later. Right now, Angel Sanctuary is owning my soul. :D

To the most AWESOME VeeTee. Make me a pretty Angel Sanctuary icon, please? :D :D

"event","I finished the third Tenchi OVA just a few mins ago, and OMG.

The three goddesses finally appeared. So did their mother. Oh, and as it turns out, their ""father"" is a glowing white like whos shape is suspiciously like Tenchi's.

They say that OVA 3 is actually the lead-in to Tenchi GXP, and its true. Fuku-chan appears at the end (FYI, Fuku-chan is Ryo-Ohki's twin cabbit that hangs around Seina Yamada in GXP, OVA three explains how Fuku-chan comes into existence), even though GXP got released before all of OVA 3.

So much happened. They all found out about Washu being a goddess, LOL. Ryoko tried bad-mouthing her and Goddess Washu hit her over the head, and she cried hiding behind Tenchi saying ""Tenchi, Mommy's being mean to me!"".

LMAO. I can't wait to grab this on DVD.

I feel so nostalgic watching Tenchi stuff. :D

Oh, for those who have seen the OVA, more stuff regarding Kagato gets mentioned, including the fact that he has offspring. That's not too spoilerish, btw. I mean, it pretty much gets mentioned in the first two OVAs, the third confirmed it. Mihoshi's brother Misao appears, he looks a lot like Mihoshi. Very feminine.

Yeah, it took me awhile, didn't it?

Though, I stopped playing awhile ago, sold it, got it back, and finished it.

Total play time is 132 hours and 28 minutes. 100% complete. Whee. Yu Yevon can so fuck off.

Good thing I beat it too. Considering I started FFX-2 before I beat it. Probably not the best idea huh?

FFX-2 is at 99 hours and 47 minutes. 92% complete.


Ill probably finish that soon enough. Though, I am taking my time so that I can watch anime.

Im so damn proud of myself. I usually don't finish RPGs (Only ever finished .hack, but my Quarantine data corrupted, so I started it again and am almost done, again).

My journal has gone to version 5.0. Yay!

Shinigami version. That BG was a pain to finish. I kept changing things around and such, going through damn near 30 other possibilitys. Settled on that one, though.

Thoughts on it?

I still can't hear right. Fuck.

Star Wars was cool, could have been better. I wanted to see Samuel Jackson go Pulp Jedi. He at least could have screamed ""Mother fucker!"" after he died. Didn't curse once. Panzy. R2D2 beat some fucking Battle Droids? WTF. Those things suck now.

Oh, and it was mother fucking 95 degrees here today. I damn near died because of the heat.

Yeah, this posts mostly bitching. gotta get it out somewhere, and since I paid for this journal.... ^__^

EDIT:
By the way, check this out.

Hey Whodo, and you thought those Star Wars people were idiots?

I found a stupid freakin' COUNTRY. Beat that. ^__^"

"event","I also feel very included to share something with everyone.

When I first started to use the net back in the late 90's, it was fun. By 2000 I discovered AMV's, and I saw one of my first, it became one of my favorites because it was done amazingly for that time.

It was a Tenchi Muyo video done by Eric Jones of Fly High Studios, to No Doubt's ""Don't Speak"", it was called The Pain Of Ryoko's Heart. Tenchi Muyo was the second anime I ever saw, and it will ALWAYS be one of my top favorites. It has everything a good anime SHOULD have. Comedy, action, and it still has time to be serious, its the perfect anime to get someone INTO anime on.

The video was amazing, and if anyone else here has seen it, I bet you can atone to that.

Anyways, as I said, I was feeling rather reminiscent and decided to scour the internet and find that video. I did find it, too.

The video was up on AMV.org for ALONG time, and when I checked, before it got taken down, it had 9.852 hits. It got removed because Eric (Yakumo on AMV.org, also the name of one of the main characters from 3X3 Eyes), released a second version (Which I never got to see, it got 1.390 hits). AMV.org didn't have it for download, so I kept searching and found a download of the original video!

So, if you havn't seen it, and you have some time to kill, go check out this video.

It PERFECTLY captures the releationship between Tenchi and Ryoko. Ryoko is one of my favorite characters of all time. She's my favorite female anime character ever, and I admit I will always love her character.

Ah, I thought I just saw my Ryo-Ohki plushie cry. I love you too, Ryo-Chan. >__>

Anyways, <a href=""http://www.toonamiarsenal.com/download/fan.php"">go here</a>, scroll down to the Music Video's section, and scroll to the bottem of it. Its third from the bottem and its called ""Ryoko - Don't Speak"", click the image of the sad Ryoko to download.

For some more fun, check out the wacky video under it dedicated to the crazy stuff Washu does. Also, the ""DBZ:Hurricane"" video is awesome for its time. DBZ and The Scorpions. Go figure.

Anyways, that Tenchi Muyo video single handidly made me wanna make AMVs, and I did for awhile. Mostly some low-quality DBZ ones because all I had was 56K for the longest time, and then two high-quality Naruto amvs, which had pixilation errors in them because Windows Movie Maker 2 sucks ass (I swear they're good vids, especially the second one, but damn you pixilation!).

I felt happy I found this video tonight, and I am going to keep it on my HD forever.


Or until I reformat, but I will find it again, don't worry. :D

P.S. I'll be online for like an hour on most messangers. AIM is MajinVegetaDGZ, yahoo is ssj5hyper_trunks (wow thats old). MSN isn't working for some reason. Wait, now it is. :D

Nevermind now, I'm offline."

Went to the Hospital, and they said they couldn't do much about it but send me to the Clinic (Woohoo, Im gonna get a Hospital bill for those assholes doing JACK SHIT!).

So, I can't see Star Wars now. Not just because I have lost full hearing in one ear, and 80% of it in the other, no, those assholes made my fucking Appointment for SEVEN IN THE GOD DAMN MORNING. Star Wars shows at Midnight and gets out at around 2:30. Theres no way I'd get enough sleep.

So, I gave my ticket to a friend, and I am gonna have him pay me back for it. No big deal.

Ill still see it eventually (I hear that its Star Wars MUST play at a theater for a month at least for them to get it. So I have plenty of time).

Still, I kinda feel like shit. All my friends are seeing it. And me?

God decides to fuck with my life again and screw me over.

Thanks God. You son of a bitch.

Oh, and, hey, I took a pic of myself earlier for my friends.

"event","So, the theater is showing Star Wars at midnight on Wednesday.

I grabbed a ticket for it today. Its nice knowing the owners, ya know? :D

Anywho, I expect it to be a entertaining flick, what with Vader finally showing up.

I'll probably make a post about it Thursday.

I never did post about my Sakuracon experience. It was fun, but I probably won't be going again anytime soon.

I had fun, but I have wound up in some serious debt because of that fun, and even though I enjoyed myself, I am regretting it now.

Guess ill just stick to Kumoricon, if I can find someone to stay with. Its troublesome living in such a remote area. However, I have four months, I am sure in that time I can meet someone to stay with for Kumoricon. I remain hopeful, anyways.

I gotta say, after the nine episodes I have seen, this is a pretty good freakin' show.

Check it out if ya have time to waste downloading something on Bit Torrent, shouldn't take more than a couple days to get all eleven episodes.

If anyones interested, check out these links:

I'd love someone to DL these, watch them, and discuss them with me. :D

EDIT: Watched the last two episodes, and I must say....FUCKING WOW. This drama is probably one of THE BEST I have ever seen. It rates up there with Mukodono (Which was awesome, too) and G.T.O.!

Check it out, people, what have ya got to lose? :D"

a. Post a list of 15 fandoms.
b. Have your friends list guess your favourite character from each one.
c. When guessed, bold the line, include the character name, and write a sentence about why you like that character

<b>1. Naruto. - Sabaku no Gaara (Gaara of The Desert).</b> Gaara's character is awesome, I think. He is a generally scary character, and his voice is just awesome. :D

2. One Piece. - Portgas D. Ace A.K.A. Hiken no Ace (Fire Fist Ace). Luffy's brother has the power of making and controlling fire. He could sure give Full Metal Alchemist's Roy Mustang a run for his money.

<b>3. Bleach. - Abarai Renji.</b> You gotta love Renji, man. Hes cool and cocky, and Zabimaru rocks.

4. Full Metal Alchemist. - Alphonse Elric. Oh come on, who DIDN'T see this coming? If you've read the manga, you know that Al is ALOT funnier in the manga. I love his expressions, and also, when hes emotional you can really feel it in the story. Go Al. A close second is Black Hayate. Yes, Riza's dog. :D

<b>5. Dot Hack (All). - Balmung of The Azure Sky.</b> Fucking Brad (The Brad that lives in Florence, not you Special B) guessed this one after looking at the list. Balmung is cool, plain and simple. Great in the game, too!

6. Mahou Sensei Negima. - Hasegawa Chiame. Not only is she smart, and looks good with glasses, shes an intenet Idol, and good with computers. My kinda gal! :D

<b>7. Death Note. - Yagami Raito.</b> He is one scheming bastard! Second favorite is Misa-chan! :D

8. Elfen Lied. - Nyuu. Yes, Nyuu. Why? She's just too unbarably cute. Lucy kinda scares me, though.

<b>9. Inu Yasha. - Sesshoumaru.</b> Who can't love a character that always has that cool aura about him?

<b>10. Tenjho Tenge. - Natsume Maya.</b> What can I say? Shes smart, strong, and hot. The triple threat.

11. Great Teacher Onizuka. - Urumi Kanzaki. 200+ I.Q., super sexy, etc etc. Sensing a pattern there?

<b>12. Tenchi Muyo. - Ryoko.</b> Brad has guessed four of them. I have always loved Ryoko. Always will, too!

<b>13. Hikaru No Go. - Fujiwara no Sai.</b> Sai is just too too funny. I cried at the end of HikaGo.

14. Bastard!! - Dark Schneider. Probably the easiest to guess since he is the main character. What to say about D.S., well, hes a badass plain and simple. Always gets the girl, does the general main character in a shounen manga role (Theres a time where he actually beats the crap out of a guy and says ""You dumbass, I'm the main character, you have NO CHANCE!"", and thats just fucking hilarious).

<b>15. Excel Saga. - Menchi.</b> What can I say? Everyones favorite emergency food supply. :D

Have fun! :D

Ill post about my Sakuracon experience later on.

Note: if these are not guessed in a week, I will reveal awnsers. The awnsers for those NOT guessed will be left UNbolded."

"event","It's finally here.

The time that comes once every year. A time where boys become men. Men become warriors, and warriors try to become legends.

Their faces marred by sweat and blood. Their bodies on the line so that they can entertain. All for the single hope of being able to call themselves ""Legend"". They'll risk it all so that they can call themselves the best.

Wrestlemania 21 has come.

My main event predictions:

Triple H (World Champion) vs. Batista - World Title Match: Batista will put up a heck of a fight, but I think in the end, Triple H will pull this one off. It will lead into a rematch at No Way Out next month.

John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL) (WWE Champion) vs. John Cena - WWE Title Match: John Cena is gonna win this one. So many people want to see Cena win, and I think its about time JBL had the title taken from him. I am pretty sure this will also lead into a rematch at No Way Out next month.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle - Grudge Match: Kurt Angle will win, by submission. I think he will cause a slight injury that will put Shawn out for a few weeks. He will mysteriously reappear at No Way Out during Kurt's match (Whatever it may be) and cause Kurt to lose it, leading into yet another rematch.

The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - Legend vs. Legend Killer Match: The Undertaker is 12-0 at Wrestlemania. Undefeated. I think the pressure will be too much for Orton to successfully pull this one off. Undertaker's record will go to 13-0. By the time he retires in coming years, he will go as the only undefeated person EVER at Wrestlemania. The Undertaker is a Legend. Even those who only watched wrestling as a hobby when they were younger know who The Undertaker is. Randy Orton is an excellent athlete, but its not his time yet. He is still too young, and The Undertaker will make him Rest In Peace. This match will cause Randy Orton to switch to Smackdown from Raw in pursuit of defeating The Undertaker, as he will be angry that he lost.

Those are my main event predictions. Later, I will edit this and post who won to see how well I did, though, I am pretty sure nobody cares. ^__^;;

EDIT: And here where the winners of the matches:

Triple H (World Champion) vs. Batista - World Title Match: Batista scored the victory, and the title. My prediction was wrong.

John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL) (WWE Champion) vs. John Cena - WWE Title Match: John Cena won, in what I thought was the most boring match of the night. To top it all off, it was shorter than I thought it was gonna be. Glad Cena won, thought it could have been alot better.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle - Grudge Match: Angle did win, by submission. So far I have this one, correct. Not sure if any rematch will take place, though.

The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - Legend vs. Legend Killer Match: Undertaker put away Orton with The Tombstone Piledriver. ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton got involved, and took a boot to the face for his efforts, courtesy of The Deadman. The Undertaker remains undefeated at Wrestlemania.

So, I got three out of four correct, not bad, huh?"

I really do mean that.

As a Native American, I do not really celebrate this sham of a holiday, but, I see it as a way of connecting with family, and enjoying each others time, so, I guess, in a way, I do celebrate. But, I celebrate family get-togethers.

Which, I guess, is much different from its original meaning, which is celebrating the subjugation of many indigenous Native American tribes.

So, as a Native American, I feel obligated to say.....

Fuck Thanksgiving.

However, to all my friends, if you celebrate this holiday for the former, then have a great time, enjoy your familys company, and eat up.

If you celebrate for the latter, than fuck you too.

Such titles as Marmalade Boy (which I finished earlier, read volume one last week, and finished the rest today, more on that later in this entry), Ai Yori Aoshi, Bleach, Ikkitousen (Manga is titled Battle Vixens), A.I. Love You, Onegai Sensei, and more.

I guess right now is a slow Anime time for me. I recently finished a few series, such as Aishiteruze Baby, DearS, and Full Metal Alchemist, so, I don't have many weekly episodes to watch now. I started grabbing Beet The Vandel Buster and the Bleach anime, so, I am rotating between five and six series now, besides whatever I watch of my <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/MyAnime/collection.php?user=Raoh&categ=5"">Anime DVD Collection</a>.

I guess I felt it was a good time to go manga readin'. I had picked up alot of GN's, alot of Number One's, too. Marmalade Boy was one of those. After reading the first couple of pages I could tell I was hooked, so I picked up the rest of it, and the first box set of the anime series (yes, I splurged. My poor poor bank account =( ).

I finished Marmalade Boy, the manga earlier, as I had said. It was a shockingly great ending. However, after the big truths came out, there was only a few more pages, so it kind of leaves you hanging as to the future of Miki and Yuu. That kinda bothered me, but I also see it as a good idea, incase Wataru has an idea for a sequal of sorts (Perhapes a ""Musterd Girl"" series? Naw, thats crazy).

Well, not much else to say right now. Ill make an update regarding my life later on.

P.S. I changed my journals layout for the first time in along time. I went with a simple layout a thats also being used for my new personal website which isn't even near completion yet. This is part of the layout. The sides will have the Navigation on them, and then theres the top banner and stuff. So, its a sneak peek for all of you. I decided not to use any anime characters in my journal layouts for awhile, and decided to use this since it will mix nicely with my new site. Changed my nickname again, since I am pretty sure nobody is using this. I shall now be dubbed ""The Digital Wanderer"". Pretty cool, huh?

Hope people like the color scheme, as I do, very much so. If I ever figure out how to add a top banner to LJ layouts and stuff, I will probably make a better layout, or mess with the sites top banner and make it so that it works for this too. Anyways, if anyone wants to tell me (I'm looking torwads KayKay and Val for this one), please e-mail me, ok?

P.P.S. On a side note, for some reason I feel very apathetic right now. I just don't feel....anything at all. No sense of....hmmm, anything, really. I don't feel angry, but nor am I happy. I just have this sense of emptyness, as if I am missing something in my life, or that I have forgotten something that was important to me, or lost something. I just feel as if something is missing, and its making me not feel anything about anything else. What could it be, I wonder?

Hmmm, maybe apathetic wasn't the right term to use for this, then?"

From <a href=""http://bbspot.com/News/2000/6/php_suspend.html"">BBSpot.com</a>:

<lj-cut text=""Student Suspended Over Suspected Use of PHP, by Brian Briggs"">

Topeka, KS - High school sophomore Brett Tyson was suspended today after teachers learned he may be using PHP.

""A teacher overheard him say that he was using PHP, and as part of our Zero-Tolerance policy against drug use, he was immediately suspended. No questions asked,"" said Principal Clyde Thurlow.   ""We're not quite sure what PHP is, but we suspect it may be a derivative of PCP, or maybe a new designer drug like GHB."".

Parents are frightened by the discovery of this new menace in their children's school, and are demanding the school do something.  ""We heard that he found out about PHP at school on the internet.  There may even be a PHP web ring operating on school grounds,"" said irate parent Carol Blessing.  ""School is supposed to be teaching our kids how to read and write.  Not about dangerous drugs like PHP.""

In response to parental demands the school has reconfigured its internet WatchDog software to block access to all internet sites mentioning PHP.  Officials say this should prevent any other students from falling prey like Brett Tyson did.  They have also stepped up locker searches and brought in drug sniffing dogs.

Interviews with students suggested that PHP use is wide spread around the school, but is particularly concentrated in the geeky nerd population.  When contacted by BBspot.com, Brett Tyson said, ""I don't know what the hell is going on dude, but this suspension gives me more time for fraggin'.  Yee haw!""

PHP is a hypertext preprocessor, which sounds very dangerous.  It is believed that many users started by using Perl and moved on to the more powerful PHP.  For more information on how to recognize if your child may be using PHP please visit http://www.php.net.</lj-cut>

This is the end folks. When stupid fuckers start confusing programming language for drugs, we are screwed.

EDIT: And yeah, it is my birthday. No, you don't have to say anything if ya don't want to, its ok with me. To me, its Saturday.

The only thing I have done that I feel like posting about is attending my first anime convention.

It was Labor Day weekend, September 4th through 6th, and it was in Portland, titled Kumoricon 2004.

I had alot of fun. I felt great to sit in a video room, watch Naruto do something stupid, and not being the only one laughing my ass off at what an ass he is.

I missed the One Piece showing, but I have seen pretty much all thats been subbed (by a certain kaizoku group ^__^), still, woulda been nice to see it. I missed it because it didn't show at the time it was listed as, because Yu Yu Hakusho was before it, but I think they may have skipped that.

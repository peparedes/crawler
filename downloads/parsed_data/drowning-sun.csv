"event","The one I had last night was just weird, I don't remember that much of it but one part sticks out. I was driving around in some super awesome classic muscle car, make and model unclear, when I saw a funnel cloud descend from the heavens. It looked like it was made of a viscous black substance, maybe oil. It looked something like this.

Behold my awesome MSpaint skillz.

It was like 4 tornadoes in one O.o Come to think of it, it sort of looks like an evil wedding cake."

"event","All my dreams lately have been fuzzy, I can't remember any of them save for a few. They all leave me with a bad feeling after I wake up, not to mention that I had one come true. Of course it may have been a coincidence but it gave me the creeps since that's happened before."

"event","I had some fucking grotesque nightmares last night.

I was in a house with some people, don't know who they were, and there was a little girl that appeared to be my friend or whatever. They had a cat and a dog. They also seemed to be the perfect example of an American Nuclear Family. Things got weirder and weirder until it culminated in them summoning a demon or monster using the cat as a ""gateway"". I was hiding in a closet with aforementioned little girl, watching. The demon burst out of the cat and ate the dog D: I guess he was the sacrifice. When they were done, the cat seemed fine. Cut to a scene with a blood-drenched but not dead cat, little girl on the floor crying, and a pool of blood slowly creeping towards her.

I think the cat was fine, though."

"event","I had terrible nightmares last night ;_; They were very....<i>Andromeda Strain</i>.  I was in this mall-like place and people started getting sick. <lj user=""ino_""> was there.  It was some kind of alien microbe, and there were insects involved somehow. The symptoms were really nasty; infected people would swell up, get oozing zits all over their bodies, and secrete this snot-looking slime from every pore. Then they'd die. D: We escaped. Happy ending, no? No. Like a month later, we discovered we were incubating the microbe and started oozing slime. Then I woke up.

It made me feel weird for a while after waking up >.<;;;;"

Then they fell off.

I woke up really confused D:

Yeah. I'm writing in this again XD"

"event","I woke up from a really bad nightmare >_> Ugh...I was at this house and this guything (I think he was sorta CryptKeeper-ish) was trying to kidnap me and kill me. He told me to run and escape if I could, but that he would find me no matter what, so I took off out of the house and into the surrounding woods. It was pitch black and I was running blindly flailing my arms to keep from hitting a tree.

Finally I come out of the woods and onto a residental street. I run to the house at the end, and I can see two older folks sitting on their couch watching TV inside. I turn and see my kidnapper limping (he walked with a limp) torwards me, so I beat on the door and they let me in...he got to the door and tried getting in but I was holding the knob so it couldn't open. I locked it and ran to their phone. It's kind of fuzzy after that, but really goddamn unpleasant still. I think I called 911 and they didn't believe me. Also the older people who's house I was in were kind of creepy, and I wondered if maybe they weren't in league with the monster guy. *shudders*

Then suddenly I was in a car driving past my own (old) house and saw him inside the window or something. Kinda fuzzy. Yeah, I woke up feeling very unpleasant from that dream, and I was sweating and had a headache on top of that. =_=; I HATE nightmares like that....they stick with me for a few hours after waking up...makes me feel all bad.

The other one I had was different. It was one of those that was SO real, and when you wake up you're all disappointed it wasn't real :( I dreamed I had some treatment (not a surgery or anything) for weightloss and it worked and I was back down to my ideal weight. I was really pretty too ;_; I didn't gag when I looked in the mirror.

And then I woke up and was like ""GOD DAMNIT."" Yeah =_=''

I haven't written in this for a while because I haven't remembered many (if any) of my dreams lately. Except those two."

"event","Last night's dreams were a mix bag of good and bad.

Dream #1
Me and dad were are a convenience store and I was sitting in the passenger side while he went in. It was night. Anyhow, I must have pissed him off or something because he suddenly came out and said ""I think you need someone to sit with you while I'm in the store"" so he got some random middle-aged kinda ugly guy and told him to sit in the drivers seat until he came back. After a few minutes, I realised that the truck was moving (somehow I didn't notice for a while, but hell, it's a dream.) and the guy had kidnapped me. I asked him what the hell he's doing, and I don't remember if he answered or not. Just kept driving. I magically somehow had a cellphone and called mum. ""Mum, I'm in dads truck with some strange guy, and he's kidnapped me!"" and she yells for someone. *insert fuzzy bit I don't recall here* and before I know it we're in the basement of my old house, me, mum, dad, and the guy that kidnapped me. Then dad started scolding him and some other things I don't remember happened. 

What scared me was the fact that a stranger took me and I didn't know what he was going to do. And it seemed pretty real. :O

Dream #2
This other one, which wasn't bad (in fact I kind of wish it were true XD) was about my hair. In the dream, my hair was down to my shoulders again. Albiet ugly and stringy, but long again. Perhaps my desire to have long hair again is leaking into my subconscious?"

"event","So I'm resurrecting my old dream journal which I only wrote in a few times x_x

Common recurrances in my dreams;
Bears - It's weird, because I'm not scared of bears at all. I LIKE bears. Yet I've had nightmares involving them chasing me/trying to get in my house my entire life.

Spiders - I'm a SEVERE arachnophobic, so it makes sense that I would have nightmares about spiders. The one I remember most is about my mum/nana morphing into a giant tarantula. I think I had that one when I was 4.

Volcanoes - I'm scared of lava, I guess. I really don't know.

Tornadoes/weather phenomena - I've had a fascination with tornadoes for a loooong time. I remember wanting to be a storm chaser. However I've recently been having lots of nightmares about tornadoes chasing me and killing my family.

Being abducted by aliens/being kidnapped - Not much to say about that....my last dream about this was last night.

Being chased by something, like a psycho with an axe or tentacled/clawed monsters - I have a lot of these dreams.

Someone I love or a pet dying - I've woken up crying a lot because of those.

Having a horrible fight with friends or family - I wake up from these feeling horrible, and sometimes even a bit angry with the person I fought with in the dream.

There are more, but I can't think of them. Usually when I dream, it's a nightmare. I don't have many nice dreams. When I do, they're a welcome relief XD

So basically this journal will be a place to write my dreams, as well as the weird shit I experience while in bed (sight & sound hallucinations, tinnitus, stuff like that) Obviously, bed is <i>not</i> and never has been my happy place. D: I am also one big ball of disorders, but we won't get into that.

Be aware that my dreams can be pretty disturbing. Don't complain if something I write grosses you out."

"event","Woo. Been forgetting to write my dreams lately. I had some not-too-nice ones in the past week or so. A recap;

I had one a few nights ago that left me rather depressed. In it, mum was dead. And I was feeling the pain. It was so fucking real too, the feelings I had and everything. *shudders* I dont remember anything other than that *_*

And the other night, I had a truly wierd one, and it was disturbing also. In it, I was at my grandparents house; not that thats even important, but that was the scenery. Anyhow, I dont even remember how it started. I just remember that there was this....thing. It was black, small, and moved on the floor. Very quickly I might add. It would come out of hiding and skitter about on the floor whenever I spoke certain words O_O And it really scared the shit out of me [in the dream]. I had a friend [dunno who it was O_O;] with me, and was telling her about it. Apparently, she didnt believe me so I decided to prove it by saying the words that made it come out. It came, and scared us both shitless. Later on in the dream, there was this dog-thing. Not sure exactly what, but it looked similar to a Jack-Russel [BooBoo influence perhaps?] and it was doing things that upset me...similar to that of the black floor-moving thingamabob. So Ill be damned if I didnt freak out and kill it. I killed a freaking puppy-thing in my dream. I think I just wanted it to leave me the bloody hell alone. After I killed it, I put in in a shoebox. But it starts moving and I just remember wanting it to DIE. So what did I do? The grossest thing possible. I began pulling out its RIBS. GROSS. They looked like babyback ribs ;o; And it still wasnt totally dead. 

I think I woke up then. Now you tell me if that isnt FUCKED. *_*:;;"

"event","Well....this is the journal I made specifically for my dreams. I feel weird writing them in my other LJ <lj user=""dirigible"">. I havent written nearly all of them, for fear of what people would think of me.  I usually have extremely violent, bloody nightmares which leave me feeling very umcomfortable after I wake up. Sometimes even heavily depressed. I do however feel better after I write them down, hence this journal. Now, noone has to be subjected to reading them unless they actually give a fuck and want to know. That and now I wont have to put them behind LJ-cuts =x

Lets start with the one I had last night, which made me feel especially bad. *grumbles* Its pretty short, because Ive waited so long to write I barely remember any of it.

It was about my cat. My cat died in the dream. Because I killed him. Keep in mind that I LOVE animals!! Especially my cat! Which is why this weighs heavily on me. I would *never* hurt my cat. But what got me about the dream was how I killed him. I....I cut his head off. I dont know WHY. I didnt have a reason for doing it! Then I looked inside and saw his brain. I left the room and came back in a minute later and Lengoe [my cat] was WALKING AROUND with a half-severed head. Dear god. I went out and told dad what I had done, and he didnt seem the least bit surprised. Thats what I remember of it. I dont actually remember if Lengoe DIED or not, but I had bandaged his head up in the end of it. Thats all I remember. Now tell me.....why would I dream that? The most horrible thing about it was that it seemed so <i>real</i>. I honestly thought it was real. It didnt seem like a dream. *cries*  

Usually in my dreams, Im trying to <i>save</i> animals. Not hurt them. +_+ Now I really hate dreaming. I wish I could just....NOT."

"event","The Darkest Of Days

The withering pieces on the floor
Are fading memories of the one I adore
A vast ocean of guilt and misery
Longing for dreams that will never be
Hopeless and lost as I blindly stumble
Through every word you spoke, only a mumble
The seas no longer crest upon my shore
And my heart will know warmth nevermore
As cold as the day that you left me there
With broken dreams I could never share
My efforts were many and results so few
For the rest of my life I will dream of you
In the end I will pause at Heaven's gate
And ask the angels why I deserved this fate
As I walk across the clouds you'll know my pain
On the darkest of days some will think it is rain"

"event","I love you! I know it may seem strange to start a letter off with that, but what else could I say. You make my world shine with the smile of your face. I would never leave you. You are like a bird in my nice tall tree. I love you so much and why is this love we have is everlasting. It will stay for the whole world to see what love really is. Honey, I love you with all my heart, soul, and life.Please listen to what I need to tell you. Even if you really don't care for me, even if you'll probably never notice me, there's something that tells me when I'm looking at you we are on this planet to be together, forever. And dear, trust me, I will do anything so that we can really be together, forever. Don't you ever realize that when I see you, two hearts in my eyes reveal my pure feelings for you, when our two bodies brush against each other, I'm feeling even more in love with you, when I see your two mysterious eyes, I always want to admit to you everything you make me feel? Not a living soul will ever be able to make me forget you. This letter represents what I've always wanted to tell you, but I'll probably never give it to you... I know that we've been through some pretty weird times, and are totally different people. But somehow we liked each other alot...and I still like you even though we aren't together anymore. Our insecurities and fear of rejection have put us to this. But I just want you to know, when I went out with you I don't know what I found in you that I loved so much. The only thing I could think of was that out of everyone in the world, you were the only one I wanted to be held by, and you were the only one I wanted to kiss, and for me, that was more than enough. A place for you remains in my heart, I am just writing to tell you how sorry I am that we are fighting. I know that what I did was wrong, and I am so sorry. I promise that if you give me one more chance, I will never hurt you again, and I will stay with you forever. You are the one person who has always loved me and supported me, and I hurt you. I just had no respect. I cannot tell you enough times that I am sorry, because I love you and I regret my actions 100 times a day. You are so precious; I could never live without you near me. I promise that from now on I will be the best girlfriend you could ever have and I will make you proud to say you are mine. Please forgive me.....
Do you remember the first day we met? You were wearing that smile that lights up a room. I ask you this question because a lot of things flashed before my face this morning. As usual, I kissed your picture good-bye and headed for school. When I opened the door, the cold, brisk, lonesome air hit me in the face. I tried to wrap myself up, but I could still feel the lonliness around me. I remembered how you wrapped your arms around me, and I could smell the sweet smell of your cologne through your jacket. I wish those days were still here."

I woroked my ass off for nothing, I got bruises, my muscles hurt for absoultly nothing! WONDERFUL!! So I was feeling pretty shitty about that, then first period I forgot to do my sonet, then all of a sudden there was a tornado drill, sowe had to go stand in the hallway and face the lockers, the fun part about that was I was standing next to Deigo, he had me laughing so hard then we got introuble because we were SUPPOSE to be taking it SERIOUSLY! well I have a hard time believeing theres gonna be a torrnado in the middle of winter, make it a little more believeable, haha anyways, then I went about my day, Second period I went to voice class and Mr. Myers gave me a FREE showcase ticket..which to me was a smack in the face becasue I  couldn't make show chior, was in it from 7th to 9th and now all of a sudden I'm not good enough for it so I never went to watch it and he gives me the ticket.....but I accepted it with a smile and said thank you, I folded all the programs for it got MANY paper cuts....Then came lunch I saw Martin and was like hey didnt you forget something lastnight and hes like whaty? I was like how about telling Liz to call my mom...and hes like OMG I did..and I was like yeah thanks, I walked home....Then I just ignored him the rest of the day, cuz I donnoI just did, untill 8th he took a note to Liz for me, then I came home did some laundry with Ashley, and I decided to call Liz and see if she was still comming over , well I called and Martin answered the phone , and he talked to me for a half an hour, then hes like i'm gonna go for a 4 wheeler ride ill see you tonight and I was like yeah whatever and hes like ok.. see ya tonight Meg. So then I waited and Liz called and said she was on her way, well I went upstairs and I started to fall asleep, she came and her bro wasnt with her so I was like yeah I knew he wasnt comming. So we went to watch tv and the 10 mins later someone puls in and in walks Martin and liz was like got ya, well he sat on the couch and we threw socks at each other then he squeesed my wrist and it hurt :*( then I finnally took him upstairs to talk to him and we talked a lil then I was lkie here let me hugg you and we hugged and he held me tight and we stood there for 10 15 minutes like that and I kissed his cheeck and whispered I love you and he didnt say anything , then I looked at him and we kissed for a LONG time, and we sat on my bed and he layed down and pulled me down next to him rubbed my back and we just layed there and held each other,I said I love you again and hes like I know and I kinda looked at him and said you dont love me and I understand and he said no I do I just cant say it. So I really dont know whats gonna happen but I love the fact that he just held me . I told him I was sorry and he said so am I and I was like why are you sorry? You didnt screw up this whole relationship I did and I was starting to cry when I was talking and he just pulled me in to him and hugged me. I miss him so very much and I hope we can work things out."

"event","I'm So Sorry
 
I'm so very, very sorry
What a stupid thing to say
I truly did not mean it
But my hurt got in the way

Before I knew it, out it came
I was angry and upset
I wanted you to feel as bad
And not let you forget

It is as if we play a game
And test each other's limit
We push and push and then one snaps
There is no sense within it

We need each other very much
Our hearts are still unbroken
I only wish we could stop and think
Before these words are spoken

Forgive me for the hurt I've caused
My ways I'll try to mend
You are to me a gift from God
My lover, my best friend.
Another chance

I'll never jeopardize your heart,
For my love for you is invincible.
Why you think I could delibrately hurt you;
I do not understand.
But I want you to know that :
I'll never do anything to hurt you again.
I am sorry if I hurt you.
Just give me another chance,
And you'll know how much I care.
I'm sorry for everything

I'm sorry you had to sit with me,
When my tears just kept falling.
I'm sorry you had to deal with me,
And all the problems following.
I'm sorry you had to hear me cry.
Now I'm stuck here drowning.

I'm sorry you have to be around me,
When I know you wanna leave.
I'm sorry you have to deal with
Everything about me.
I'm sorry you don't love me,
But I do love you.

I'm sorry I can't be perfect.
I'm sorry I was never good enough.
I'm sorry I can't be with you.
I'm sorry I love you.
But most of all,
I'm sorry for being me.

 

Accept my apology

I know I have hurt you.
I know have done so many things tobreak your heart.
I know I've made you cry.
But please forgive me.
God forgives you your sins,
so forgive me mine against you.
No matther what I did to hurt you,
This apology is from deep inside my heart.
Accept my apology!

 


I love you.
 
I'm Sorry

I know what I said hurt you bad,
but the intention was not to leave you feeling sad.
I was upset because you still kept her letters,
when in a few months we will be wed and take on life together.

I never ever want to share your love,
b'coz to me you're a blessing from above.
For all the times I hurt you bad,
said things to you when I was mad.

I would like to say I'm Sorry Sweetheart,
I will try changing not just my view point but also my heart.
For I now realise the importance of trust,
and shouldn't let happy times fly away like dust.

Gimme a chance, just one last time,
I will stand besides you through rough tides.
Never ceasing my love for you,
Loving you like you would always want me to.

 
the love is real

The love is real
And still is 
We fight and make up
That's what makes relasionship long
Though,sometimes
Been sorry may not be enough
But there's nothing to say
Than""I'm sorry"".
 

My True Apology For My Baby

I know I've hurt you

I know I've made you cry

I wish I could change what I have done

Baby I regret it everyday

I know you are tired of hearing what I got to say

But baby I am truly sorry, will you please take me back?

I've learned my lesson

I know you think I hurt you on purpose, but baby I was foolish

I love you and only you so please let's get it together

Because you are my present and my future

You are truly a gift from God

I apologize my love, please accept my apology."

I know you cared about me more then anything and I know that what I said was wrong, I didn't even think about it, people say things that they don't mean out of anger,(like how Liz says she hates your mom when she really dosen't). I feel like I lost the greatest thing in my life and I hate that feeling ....and to know that I hurt you is killing me.... I know I can't change what has happened...and a lot has happened between us a lot bad and I don't like that either...I f I could take back what I said I would and if I could go back in time and prevent this all from happening I would....I can't stand the fact that we don't talk...I don't know what to say I don't know what to do, I don't know if it really even matters to you, but it really bothers me.....We don't talk , we don't touch ,We don't even look at each other when we pass in the halls...you use to give me a smile or say see ya or hey...and I miss that...I just want you to know YES I KNOW YOU CARED AND I LOVE YOU MORE THEN LIFE AND ALWAYS WILL"

Other then actully being with him...haveing him say my name and that i am his girlfriend theres a lot I miss... how he would give me a lil smile in the hall when we passed each other... the lil kisses after votech before I went to class... his hugs... most of all I miss him lying next to me... the sound of his heart beat that made me sleep....the way he played with my hair....and how he ran his fingers up and down my arm... and when he hugged me he played with my back.....
 i miss the kisses on my nose....and forhead... and the hand squeezes....and how he use to tell me he loved me really really or a million sweedinsh fish,....or how he would smile at me when we wanted something....and how when I would get hurt I would make a sad face and he would just start to smile and suddenly I forgot I got hurt.....and how he use to keep me warm when I got cold..and how he would give me his jacket to make sure I didn't get the slightest shiver,,,,How he use to sing to me...and he never picked on me for being short... said i was perfect...and he never judged me I know I am fat but he never said i was...and always told me I was smartter then I let people think... and that I didnt give myself enough credit...and how he was there for me when I had a bad day... called me after football and work even though he was tired just so I could hear his voice before I went to bed and I could hear I love you... and how he called during a storm beacuse he knew i didnt like them...how he was there for me when my dad left.. left me cry for it.. and when my sister was sick how he just l=ayed there and held me and let me cry while he said it was going to be alright... and he was there for me...nothing was gonna happen....I miss everything about you...I just want you to know... I never ever said I didn't care about you I would never do it because I could never not care about you... and I love you more then my own Life..."

Didn't get my teeth brushed
I crashed on the couch
And now my mouth tastes like yesterday's news
Well hello Jim Beam
Oh the places you've seen
If only you could talk 
You'd tell me why he walked out on me and you

Oh the things lovers do when it's over
Oh the things lovers do when it's done
Find a cool bottle or a warm shoulder
Wake up older 
And try to move on

I drove around last night
Thinkin' 'bout our last fight
I cruised by your house
And all the lights were out and you were gone
So I found me a stranger
Well theres comfort in danger
But I thought about you 
The whole time we were gettin' it on

DUH!! Anyways... Bud(martin) was ridding the snowmobile...I wanted to go for a ride but I was too affraid to ask him....So Liz was like I'll ask him... well I guess he said yeah... but Liz said Go... and I figured she was saying it to him because he gets pissy about me....But she was talking to me...I missed my chance...but I didnt know how I was gonna take it,.... Like should I hang on...hang on a lil or hang on as tight as I could.... WHY AM I SO DUMB??? Maybe I should give up on him or what?? I don't know....Why can't everything get better...

I'm kinda gonna miss everything that happened in 2004! THeres a lot that took place in my life... My dad came home for not even 2 months and he had to leave again.. Martin and I were together 3 yrs and we broke up...then got back together now broke up again...I really don't know if we will get back together this time.. I really hope so..but I guess time will tell...We went to Chicago and took Superior in Chours and Chamber Singers... The Spring Musical was GREAT!! That wasalot of fun.. long hard practice nights...but it was well worth it..MY LAST Wintersongs concert...MY LAST Broadway Dinner Theater performance...I've done a lot ofLasts in 2004 but I can't wait for all my FIRSTS in 2005!! I'm ready for what the world can send my way... NYC here we come formy LAST TIME but I will make it as great as MY FIRST! ...."

"event","I forgot to add some memories in my last enrty... No one will ever forget the feeling of being in a new place for the first time and hopeing you get excepted....My first time working for camp jj I was scared shitless...but soon I got to talking to people and learned i'm not different from them at all.. the only way I was , was not being born in the U.S. and they excepted me for it they wanted to know all they could about life outside this country...and as the years went on I continued to go back...Only because your camp friends are kinda different from you everyday friends.. they tought me that hey its cool for guys to wear dresses!! And how much fun it is to play a role in the Weekly talent show.. not everyone gets to be part of the cookie show (HOLA TO THE CREW!!) And I also learned how to make a mountain pie and what one was(sorry no girl scout skills) ... my most valuable lesson was the circle of trust... it feels good to be involved in one of the greatest bunches of girls and people I have ever spent a week of my life with ... and its cool to know Im not the only girl who dosent know how to build a fire!! 
And in making camp friends who knew that one special girl who turned out to be one of my best friends..Her dad knows my dad (uh oh!) lol.... She taught me wonders.. how to piss your ex-boyfriend off! How to take Jello like a man... that swimming at 230 in the moring is well DUMB!! , and that no matter how hard you think you have it theres someone just like you or worse who has been wating for someone like you to talk to about it.... Learned that wearing an Otto Eldred jersey at the Big 30 caused some grief(DUH we're all on the same team!!).. and that sleeping in is a WONDERFUL thing after a hard night.. and we can fit 7 people in one bed and still have room to be comfortable..And ALSO never to share a bed with Shane.. he stabs you in the eye!!But the are totally oblivious to the game Bullshit and how Chris and I cheated SO BAD!! hey we still got out!! So its not cheating its moving ahead , in an unfair way!And I learned that no matter how down or ready to die I am.. she will be there to help me or die along with me...(not thatIm gonna hurt myself chill people)All my O-E peeps Love yas.....And other memories are of my Cos chicas!! I miss you girls oh so much... Can't believe i'm not there to CHEER yous...But I'm there in sPiRiT!! Everytime you hear my Immortal think of me cuz I'm somewhere singing lol!! How wonderful were the years we spent .. from One Buffalo trip to the Next... how many times did I lose my privaliges?? lol did it affect me in anyway...ummm nope not really!! Yelling at the teacher.. Christmas parties.. Fun DAY!! Oh Rock on girls you guys kick!! And last but not least Martin.. I know I mentioned you in the first one but I remembered more things.. We didn't really have a PERFECT realationship...but i wouldn't change any of it.. you taught me that its ok to be affraid , but I knew no matter what you wouldn't let anything happen to me, and that you don't have to be a size 2 to be pretty.. you liked me for me...you also taught me that syrup DOSE come from trees(sorry I didnt know) and that cows wont hurt me ( the babys at least) You made me feel like a princess.. you called me after football...when you knew you had to get ready for work.. and you called me after work when I knew all you wanted to do was sleep because you had a rough day but you still called.... And you came to spend the weekends with me unless i was up there and we spent every min we could together... and I learned that you were the best thing that ever happened to me.. I don't think I would be this way if we never happened.. and for everything youve done and give and taught me thank you so very much.. its something I will cherrish and adore forever...Who knows maybe someday you will come back to me.. but untill that day i am glad we are still friends atleastYou've played an important role in mylife.. and I don't want to lose it or you."

"event","You know Life is what you want it to be life is what you make it.. and I know lately I've been nothing but stressed out .. and I got to thinking My life is actully wonderful... Nothing can ever replace all the things I've found out through my years like Friends come from many places and each one is different in their own way.. they taught me things thatI will remember for the rest of my life like.. blue frosting makes an interesting conversation piece 2 yrs down the road or that celing fans have their own launage..and Cake fights rock!! And how calling GHOASTBUSTERS isn't a really good idea.. you get some strange guy yelling at you in a funky language...And who knew that still playing dress up is fun or that lipstick makkes neat hair ccolor but is hard to was out...and that maybe haveing your friends do your make up isnt always a smart idea..and who knew tampons make great people and a great gift when they are people...or that people drift apart but always find their way back....
You always make new friends and they teach you things like cows aren't as bad as you think or swimming at 1130 is a lil too cold for normal people.. or that driving a 4 wheeler isnt as hard as it looks its sometimes harder..And they are always up to get in to trouble or do dumb stuff with you like go to Sheetz and buy blue condoms just because its fun.. or pretend to be hurt just so they could ride around in the electric carts at Walmart...Or play tooth fairies and get stupid pictures taken...
Not only do you make friends.. but you also find that special someone..someone who shows you who you are.. and if isnt able to show you helps you find youreself.. or someone who will call you during a thumderstorm because they know you're scared of them.. or calls you afterwork just to make sure you know they love you and just to hear you tell them you love them before they go to bed...or is there for you when your cat dies..or gets you a new cat because they want you to be happy..or feels really bad they didnt talk to you much the day of your annavisary and comes to see you that night afterwork with a handful of your favorite flowers.... Then you know this person is really special.. It's taken me a while to figure this out but if it wasnt for my friends or family or the love of my life I wouldnt be whoI am now.. So all I have to say to you guys is.. I LOVE YOU!! YOU MEAN EVERYTIHING TO ME!!"

I'm so tired of being here suppressed by my childish fears if you have to leave I wish that you'd just leave your presence still lingers here and it wont leave me alone ..When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you screemed I'd fight away all of your fears i held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me... You use to capitvate me but your resignating mind but now Im bound by the life you've left behind your face it haunts my one pleasent dream your voice it chased away all the sanitiy in me .. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you screamed I'd fight away all of your fears..i held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me..I tried so hard to tell myself that youre gone but though youre still with me ive been alone all along.. when you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you screamed id fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me...."

"event","Uwo~ it's been a while i didn't write a new entry ^^;
Well...mainly because I don,t have much to say these days...well, nothing very interesting, haha~

oh yeah, the other, i went at Koyama's place and we tried to bake cookies XD
(well, I did all the work but whatever *coughs* XD)

Hmmm what else...hmm, these days, it's only RH and RH all the time, lot of work, not a lot of time to hang out and see each other, that's the bad point of being an idol isn't it? haha~

Also recently, some..eeer...'accident' happened..but i guess you guys all know about it already, and i'm not willing to give any comments on this anyways, so let's just skip this part..

It's been so long nobody wrote new entry.. (well execpt kusano, lol, i just read it before writing mine =P) 
I hope people will re-start being more active soon ^^;

ok that's all for todaaaay"

I've been so busy recently, and Koyama and Massu went to Korea, no fair lol =P

Anyway, this entry is mainly because today is July 4th, so:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MASSU!  (^_^)v
Still can't believe you're a year older than me =_=;
Oh well, my birthday is soon too! 
Massu's and I birthdates are very close ne~
oh also, it's Kat-tun's Akanishi Jin's birthday too

So, my exams week is finally over, I can't wait to go out with NewS members again ^^
I sent text message to Koyama yesterday to tell him i'm back, I think he was happy, and we talked about his trip to Korea a little too..
hmmm, what else to say..
Aaaah, it's been so long I haven't talk to everybody =_=
Except of Kei, the last person I talked to was Massu, once again on text message to tell him happy birthday, lol
I kinda miss Tegoshi and Kusano (thinking about this, it's be soooo long i haven't talked with Kusano O_oll)
and it's been a while I didn't talk to Nakamaru too..
Oh well, I hope I can see all of them soon ^_^

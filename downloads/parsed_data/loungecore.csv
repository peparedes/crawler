Jillian was supposed to come over on saturday to sled with me, but that didn't work out cause she couldn't get a ride or somethin, I was pretty disappointed cause I was really looking forward to that (I was gonna give her the bonage). I'm so sick of working, I only have 3 days off this next 2 weeks. At least I'm finally starting to get a band together, with Chase and Ruthie, we still need a drummer though. Well that's all for now, who knows when I'll update again..."

So me, ruthie, becca, and specter went to a fucking PIZZA PLACE before the dance. Haha fuck it, we're punx, we don't care. Anyways, at the dance some kid comes up to me and says he used to go to carlynton and he saw me in the hall and shit and I've never seen this kid before in my life so I was like ""oh ok..."". On another note, I hate my new boss and his backward-ass ways of doing things. I have been plotting to kill him for some time now. Perhaps tomorrow I will attempt to make a pact with my co-workers to do this."

"event","My computer is a bitch. I can't get it to play cds, I have windows media player but it won't work for some reason. If my computer was a person, I'd fight it. with that said, today pretty much sucked. It was a school day, which is bad to begin with, because I hate school. I ordered this shirt online a few weeks ago and it came today. I ordered a small and they sent me a large which is way too big for me and that just set me off. I have a lot of surpressed anger (especially towards some people but I won't name names) that just builds up inside of me and once in awhile something really stupid will make me just snap and let it all out. Thats what happened today when i got sent the wrong size shirt. I was more than angry, I was more like in a rage. I was ust like ""FFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1""  and then I threw some shit. This usually only happens when I'm by myself and no one ever sses me throw these fits. I think I amy have done it in front of my sister and maybe my mom, but thats it. I also had to go to work today. I hate my job but today was especially shitty. I got really behind in my work and I was trying frantically to get caught back up. also I didn't get a chance to talk to Brandi because I only saw her for like a few seconds. She's this girl I work with who I have a little bit of a crush on. But now, I'm at home and i feel better because I got some bean burritos and I don't have to work tommorrow so it's all good."

"event","standing on the edge of morning 
scent of sex and new found glory 
playing as she's pulling back her hair 
she drives away 
she's feeling worthless 
used again but nothing's different 
she stayed the night 
but knows he doesn't care 

home by three 
deafening quiet 
the porch light's off 
yes they forgot it 
she cried herself to sleep 
but she don't dare 
then she wants to be a model 
she wants to hear she's beautiful 
she's beautiful 

i want to save you 
i want to save you 
i need you 
save me too 
i want to save you 

dressed by dawn and out the door 
no light 
she memorized the floor 
so she could leave without being detected 
she works till three 
it's uniform 
she dreams that he'll come by the store 
she prays for days 
the boys mean she's protected 
and she wants someone to see her 
she needs to hear she's beautiful 
she's beautiful 

i want to save you 
i want to save you 
i need you 
save me too 
i want to save you 

and she won't sleep 
she won't sleep 
and she won't sleep 
at all 

i want to save you 
i want to save you 
i need you 
save me too 
i want to save you"

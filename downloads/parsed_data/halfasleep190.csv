I also hope that she can become friends with some people that she hasnt been friends with forever, but thats just me... Oh, i was also called a self-centered slob today by my mom; she didn't say it to be mean, but god it was just... bad. 

On the bright side: I CAN PLAY CONTACT SPORTS!!!!!! WOOOOHOOOOO! I am soooooooooooo happy. I am trying to line up a tryout with FCDelco for sunday, but I might have to call the coach. I am also practicing with Hockessin as much as I can. For an idea, these teams are ranks 9th and 5th in country, respectively. I am greatly looking forward to it. I am not in top form though, so making a team will be hard. I don't know. I just wish things could be better."

"event","I know i havnt been around... i dont know whats been up. but something happened, and i realized how much it bothers me about a half hour ago.

Will Tripley was shot in the back of the head on Easter Sunday. He was in critical condition and on life support until this afternoon, monday, when he was taken off life support and died. He was 19. I do not know the exact date of his birth. I didnt know him well, seeing how much younger i am than him. But i played soccer with him. On the surface at least, he was one of the nicest guys i have ever known. He was nice to everybody, from the 5 year olds he coached at camp to the guys he dominated on the field. The only time i ever do something callous was when he screamed at a referee because of a bad call. And the scary thing is he is just going to become another statistic. Another black boy shot; another black murderer, in all likelyhood, to add to that homicide list. And my only question is why the fuck would anyone do that? It just hurts too many other people. And it leaves an emptiness everywhere were anyone used to be. I just don't understand."

I know that too. But when you attack my upbringing, when you attack my parents... I am going to go for your fucking neck. I have always had issues with my dad being the headmaster. And it just bothers me that he can freakin waltz in and say that he was brought up the right way. It also bothers me that he thinks that he thinks he is better than everyone because he is paying for a private school education and isnt in the richest .5% of the world. GUESS WAT! WE HAVE A WINNER! HE'S ONLY IN THE TOP 1% OF THE WORLD! It drives me crazy, because he makes a big deal about how the Shipley atmosphere is hell, when really he is acting more arogant than any one of the rich brats at our school. I know he means well, but he has to understand that it is a double edged sword. And im also ticked b/ i was gonna go to bed at 1030 and now its almost midnight. Well, im going to bed. Good nite. Have a nice day."

"event","shit, i havnt postd inawhile. Oh well. Anyway, i've been back at school for a week now. I've been exhuasted from it lately, but i used a wheelchair all day today and slept well last night, so i feel pretty good. Air left yesterday for london, which is annoying, but I am doing much better than i thought i would do (in case any of you didn't know, i have seperation anxiety issues). I worked out (lifted weights) for the first time since i broke my leg. Oddly, i lift almost as much with just my left leg now then i did with both legs before. Also, i lift more on almost every machine. My free weights have gone down, but thats all that has really dropped. It felt good to finally be able to do something again. Hopefully being more pleasent will come as a result, to both my siblings and my friends. No one is on line right now, so i have nobody to talk to, and as a result of feeling good, i cant sleep. Aight. Im gonna go do something. ill talk later."

That number has been upped to about seven. air has been a real help to my mom throughout the entire shenanigan, and my mom is getting her something because of her help (what i will not disclose because sh could read this). Im kinda blah because we dont get to have a real valentines day b/ she'll be in london. it's all blah. but we are going to get out own v-day, which i guess is special in it's own right. 

We also found out our rules for the school play. The play is Pajama Game. I'm the boss. It is a principle role, and i didn't try out, so i guess i shouldnt complain. But it certainly is a step down.

Well, i woke up on monday at around 1030. The school had a snowday, and the roads were crappy, but there was a possibility some of my friends could stop by to say hi and good luck before the surgery. Well, around 11, the hospital called and said that most of the surgeries had been cancled, so i had to come in around thirty minutes. That kinda pissed me off, but it was sooner for the surgery, so that was an upside. I got there, changed, and sat around for about five minutes, than went into a room. I wrote yes on my leg and talked ot an anestiolegist. We decided on general anestesia (where they knock you out completely), and then the guy slipped me something. I was out before i got into the OR. I woke up around 5, five hours after the surgery started. I don't really remember much - just throwing up green liquid, talk to air, and watching Everwood (the details of which i don't remember). I also remember alot of pain. All right, i'm done. More later."

Well, i didn't get recast and the report was to say, not good. I have to get surgery on monday :( I am gonna be out of commision until at least nex thursday. And the little sojourn out of my coup up here was exhausting. My muscles are still really sore, and i feel like shit. It didn't help that at midnight last night as i was getting up on my crutches to turn out the lights and go to the bathroom when i slipped. I hurt my leg reeeeeallly badly. It was the worst pain i had  felt since it happened. It, as they say, sucked monkey balls. Im feeling kinda ok right now; i'm  in the least pain that i have been in since the accident. But I'm having some other issues that im not gonna go into, and im still exhausted from yesterday. I'm also really lonely and board sitting up here all day. Well, i'm out. People should be visiting soon, so that should be good. I'll talk to you all later. The edited edition of the poem will be here by the end of the night."

It hurts. It hurts like the pain after winning an endless war. It is a good pain, that pain. It is the pain of a million little moments piled into one. It is a good pain. I'm not sure if you would call it pain. More like a quest. Yeah, that sounds right. Accept it isn't. Well, almost. Anguish and joy, all rolled into one; It's a word people have been unable to define for years. It's like the kiss of the cool wind of autumn, or the catharsis that comes with the new spring after the ice thaws. It's like the smooth feeling of the snow crunching under your feet; you feel a little guilty, because that snow was so beautiful; but you know it was the right thing to do, because or else you could not have reached your destination. You could not have found the grail you are searching for, without breaking that snow. And it is like the crashing of the ocean waves on a stormy night in the feverish summer, destroying the sandcastles that had lined the beach since the early morning. You all know what I am talking about. At least, I think most of you do."

"event","A summery of what has happened to me over the past day and a half: Monday started off with remembering i had completely forgotten to write my Latin paper and bombing a math test. Nothing of much occurence really happened until my basketball game, in which i had 8 points, 4 steals, 3 assists, and 2 rebounds. We won 30-23 (we can't score, i know, just keep your mouths shut). I then came home, showered, wrote my latin paper, and ate. I then sought to get ready for the concert. Being my first concert, i had no idea what the hell to wear, so i just kinda threw on what i could find and hoped for the best. The drive to the concert was somewhat forgetable, but when i got there... it was amazing. We watched the opening act, who sucked. Then Dave came on. I have to say, minus the various stoners, the concert has gotta up there with one of the most amazing events of my life (right along with my Bar Mitzvah, my first kiss, and seeing Eliza Dushku for the first time). Dave and Tim Reynolds opened, and they were brilliant. They played for about 30 or 40 minutes, playing 4 songs with various guitar riffs and interjections by Dave. At one point, he commented he would just smoke until he got ""too fucking cold"", and all i could do was laugh. The third song he played was Crush. It was the best preformance of the night, by all means. We then meant to intermission for 15 minutes, and Dave opened after the intermission with Grave Digger. The rest of the concert was kinda a blur, probably because of the pot smoke billowing out from the crowd. When i got home, i studied for my science quiz and watched the Eagles play. Went to bed, woke up, went to school. I then preceded to make several stupid mistakes on my science and get the disk for Adobe from Chris. The rest of the day was uneventful until i got my braces off. I then came home and did my spanish homework. And here i am now. Talk to you all later, the few of you who actually talk to me. Later."

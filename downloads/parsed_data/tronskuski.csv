About Myself...About Tofu

By Steven 

My life is a cube of tofu
It has no taste
whatsoever.
There's something to concider.
How can something 
that's definately there,
with a definate shape, consistancy
(we'll get to the consistancy later)
Not have a taste?
That is my life.
No taste. Flavour as you will
Salt as needed.

Ancherman was essspecially funny, even though I didn't want to like it, so then I left and tried to find friends.  On fourth floor I found Danny Whittmer who was bored, and Mi Amore who was painting, and Geoff Wilson who's a recluse.

She was a girl,
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk,
She did ballet,
What more can i say?

He wanted her, 
She'll never tell secretly she wanted him as well, 
But all of her friends,
Stuck up their nose, 
They had a problem with his baggy clothes. 

He was a sk8er boi,
She said see you later boy,
He wasn't good enough for her,
She had a pretty face,
But her head was up in space,
She needed to come back down to earth. 

5 years from now,
She sits at home,
Feeding the baby she's all alone,
She turns on TV,
Guess who she sees, 
Sk8er boi rockin up MTV.
She calls up her friends,
They already know,
And they've all got
Tickets to see his show.
She tags along, 
Stands in the crowd, 
Looks up at the man that she turned down.

He was a sk8er boi, 
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her. 
Now he's a super star,
Slamming on his guitar,
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry girl but you missed out, 
Well tough luck that boy's mine now, 
We are more than just good friends,
This is how this story ends.
Too bad that you couldn't see, 
See the man that boy could be.
There is more than meets the eye,
I see the soul that is inside.

He's just a boy, 
And I'm just a girl,
Can I make it anymore obvious?
We are in love,
Haven't you heard,
How we rock each others world?
(sing 2X)
I'm with the skater boy, 
I said see you later boy, 
I'll be back stage after the show, 
I'll be at the studio, 
Singing the song we wrote, 
About a girl you used to know."

Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read,
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed,
And on the pedestal these words appear:
""My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
Look upon my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

Being the uncultured country boy I am, I've never been to a coffee house, and the only thing I've ever had in coffee is hazelnut Coffee Mate.  It was really cool to just talk about stuff, and not have him be a teacher for 5 minutes.

So he said he was going to call Dr. Kalyn the head of the NCSA School of Music, and see where I stand.  I don't know how much he'll find out, if he finds anything out at all, but it'll be a nice jesture."

"event","So, have you ever taken off your socks and found gunk between your toes? It happens to me all the time. That and gunk in my belly-button. I'm thinking about selling it all on ebay. Surely someone will purchase it!
I'll have you all know that I've already purchased some gifts for the gift exchange. (no, I won't wrap up my lint and gunk.) Sometimes you all can just be soooo sick!"

Well, now you know. So, if you IM me and I don't write back... it's probably cause I'm not there. Much love to you though.

"event","So, let me just say that 'm here at the National Youth Workers convention. Yesterday we had Jars of Clay, KJ-52, David Crowder Band, and many others leading worship and it was awesome... he conventon i put on every year by Youth Specialties and is for... well you guessed it, Youth Workers. It's packed full of seminars on youth ministry and great sessions. Doug Feilds was one of the speakers yesterday. One of my biggest frustrations in YM is games... So, I sat in on, of all things, a games seminar today. WAY COOL. I bought a couple of books and one from the speaker Les Christy. GAMES WILL NEVER BE BORING AGAIN! 
MUSIC LOVERS TAKE NOTE...
There is a company called interlink that many youth groups subscribe to. The provide 40 hot and kickin CD's a year packed wih posters and devotionals about the songs.. It costs $300 a year... at is about what we make in one car wash. I'd love to create a music library for the YG... Anyone intersted in donating? Think about it! Got to go!

"event","Since yesterday I've been at the White Oak Conference center in South Carolina for my second ""Unordained Men's Retreat"". There are 22 pastors here with myself. Wow, would you be intimidated being in this room? Hmmm... let me tell you that pastors are cool people. I can tell you all kinds of cool stuff but I'm not sure how interesting it might be to you... so, let me give you a summary...

1. Lots of prayer and fellowship... (pastors are people too man, fellowship is a good thing)
2. Monday night football and Pizza Hut... great combination especially when the Steelers win!
3. Homework???... The ordination process takes about 2 years and lots of work and preperation. Ask me about it : )
4. Games... the desire to play never dies... Just ask Al Benz about his friend Mr. Randy Dye : )

The more time I spend with pastors the more I realize how much I love my job. You know I wouldn't have a job if it wern't for you! Thank you... I pray that God blesses you as much as you have blessed me!

"event","Today marks the beginning of a long week. A good week (to be) but a long one none the less. I just had breakfast with My wife... (Ask me sometimes why I call her my wif or my birde... good story) We went to our favorite breakfast place that Nate introduced us to many many moons ago Carter Brothers. I think we need to have a youth group outting to carter brothers. If anyone wants to buy PJ a christmas present a C-bros tee shirt would be a great addition. Anyway @ 8:00am I have a chiropractor appt. Fun stuff. Come wednesday to hear all about my out of whack back. Good times. From there I leave for Winston to meet with Pastor Brian. We will then carpool to the ""Unordained Men's Retreat"" till Wed. I come back for YG, kiss My wife then go to bed and wake up the next morning and drive off to A youth workers convention in PA from Thurs - Monday. Really awesome thing, I know you're all pumped up and excited and all that.
Well, it's 7:45, I got to get my back fixed..."

"event","So, You'll never guess what happened to me just now... Yeah Yeah.. Forget that it's been a month since I've last updated my journal. Forget that I just drank a bottle of water and had 2 triscuit's... (aren't they good... slightly salty and oh so crunchy). Forget that I drank old milk this morning on accident, and Forget that I'm rambling... I was able to talk to a good friend of mine. (What, that doesn't sound interesting to you... well what if I told you that the good friend of mine lives in Korea?!) Talk about brightening up someones day... Elizabeth called her dad and Robert passed the phone to me after a bit. Almost 2 months ago Elizabeth and Gigi left for Korea. Emails and letters are great but a live person on the other end of the phone kicks butt! 
Ok, I know that long journal entries are often skimmed over by the busy non long journal entry reader. But this is really cool. I was able to pray with Elizabeth over then phone and she is like over a hundred miles away... ok, more like 2,000 miles. I was blessed and encouraged. Yes, we miss Eilzabeth and Gigi very much but they'll be home in a little over 2 months for Christmas. How cool is that. Man, God is Good! Changing the subject a little... why is it that after being beaten up and kicked around that then, running to Jesus is sooooooo sweet. Why? Because being reminded that you can't do this thing called LIFE on your own is sometimes EXACTLY what we need. God is standing there with open arms waiting for you to run to him. I wish we could all get beaten up because life with Jesus is SOOO sweet. Life away from him is all that the world says is good and satisfying. How satisfied are you?
What you value is reflected in how you live your life."

"event","It's kinda sad but I can't think of anything more interesting to talk about than football... THe Steeler game was on yesterday and I got to watch them play... Miriam even watched with me. Woo Hoo! Here is an interesting yet somewhat embarrassing truth... Miriam and I finally discovered how to download ringtones yesterday. She downloaded the Duke fight song and I downloaded Broken Heart from Falling Up... (Ben, I hope you now think I'm worthy of your friendship) j/k Falling Up does rock no matter what other people say Ben.
This book I'm reading (still) ""Case for a Creator"" by Lee Strobel just continues to blow my mind. It seems that all areas of science points to a creator... Physics, Astrology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology... It's just amazing. Amanda... I really think that you'd enjoy this book! (being a college student and all : )
Well, I'm spent. I'm off to District Prayer conference in Winston this week. Good times!

"event","Can I just tell you that Mike is really cool. He came to church on Wed. at like 3:00pm. We went out to dinner and got us some cheesecake. (Fat kids unite!) I remember the lowest price I ever saw gas get to was $0.67 in Toccoa Georgia back in 1998. Most of you don't know this but I my first job was working at a Shell Gas station. I pumped gas and cleaned bathrooms and all kinds of dirty work. I used to have to change the gas price signs. I worked there from 1993-1995. Gas never got above $1.20 a gallon. But did you know that it's not really a gallon... it's 9/10's of a gallon. Crazy right. Today I was driving to church and everywhere it was $3.29. I saw a guy driving an electric golf cart. Thats one was to conserve. I think I'm gonna take my new t shirt making business and buy a fleet of golf carts and just drive them everywhere. Yeah that would be nice."

It's very frustrating having to share. Not that I don't like sharing. But there are 3 of us here at the church that need to get online every day so we kinda have to share and it's frustrating at times for all of us.
Anyway here are some of my favorite websites. 

www.amusingfacts.com (a website that has nothing but useless information)
www.thesource4ym.com (great youth ministry tool that has a bunch of stuff including about 5,000 ideas for games)
www.biblegateway.com (AWESOME... it has like 30 different bible translations and will help you find any verse or passage you can think of.)
www.alliance-youth.com (the CMA's youth website)
www.steelers.com (well, not everything has to be spiritual)
www.homestarrunner.com (if you have never been.... you really need to check this out!)
www.reverandfun.com (silly cartoons for churches and stuff)
www.weather.com (yeah yeah... we don't have cable so we need to get weather for more than just GSO sometimes)
www.msnbc.com (news news news)

So, check them out... you need to go to home srat runner if you have never been before!"

I'm really kinda frustrated with the bowling people. They gave us such a great deal last year and this year they really gave us the shaft. If Cel. Sta. can't do anything really great for us then we'll go to Lazer Storm. They can give us 2 hours unlimited play for $10 a student. ""Lord, show me which event will be the best to choose for this Lock-In. My heart is for all who come to have a great time but I want everything to point back to you. Thank you for the ability to go and do something fun."""

"event","I'd like to take this moment to write a short dissertation on Rebecca McDonald. Her care free days of not being asked to drive are about to come to an end. As she goes to get her license today may she think about how mice it was to not have this ability. Lo may she recall how life was before the constant requests came from Mother and Father. Rebecca, mayest you getteth the milk from thine store yonder. Oh yes... Mother and Father rejoice that they may soon have a errand girl in the house again. Watch Rebecca as they sit in the den thinking up ways to put your driving foot to work. ""We can send her to get dog food!"" Said mother... ""We don't even have a dog!"" Said father. ""Isn't that wonderful!"" mother replied. Father with a big grin on his face responded with great cheer...""Brilliant!""
Poor poor Rebecca, can't you see that getting your license will be the end of freedom as you know it! I implore you to rethink this ghastly decision. I only pray that it is not too late!"

"event","Last night was fun... it's hard for me to guage how things go sometimes. I know that God really gave me oone thing to communicate and I hope the message got across. It was really cool to see Nate's friends come last night too. It's funny how the focus of the message changes when a potential non-believer is in the room. Man I would love it if we had that happen every week. 
So we have the lock-in coming up in 2 weeks. This whole night is always a lot of fun but I wonder if the students really see that I live for the 15 minutes that I get to share the gospel. If everything went off without a hitch but there were no new friends brought... the night was not a success. That's just something that's been on my mind. For the rest of us... what will it take for God to really get our attention? I mean I even feel it in my own life... This drive for self. If I lost everything then would I FULLY depend on God? I hate how I get in the way of what the Creator of the Universe wants to do in and through me.
Last night after youth group I was supposed to go to a Church Council meeting. Becky's step-father (Miriam's best friend) died earlier that day during liver transplant surgery. Becky asked us to come and be with her and her mom... but the strange thing was she asked Miriam speciffically that I come. Miriam had grown up with this girl and her family for her whole life. I had just known the family for a few years. Well, we went with the Church coouncil's blessing and prayers. I was able to pray with Becky's mom and family. It's funny... I'm like the only pastor Becky really knows and it was weird for me to be in that situation because I was a pastor. Anyway...
One more quick thing... I'm reading a few really cool books. One has gotten a little dry but the others are really cool. 
""The Case for a Creator"" by Lee Strobel is AMAZING. It totally combats evolution from a scientific point of view... not a christian's scientific p.o.v. but a Scientist's scientific p.o.v. Really cool stuff. Then I'm finishing up ""Glorious Appearing"" the last book in the left behind series.. Really cool stuff. It says in Revelation that Jesus will come back and kill all who don't believe him with a sharp two edged sword. in the book they protray this as him just quoting scripture and the words cutting to the hearts of men and them just dying. Really cool... last one is a book for ordination called ""The children's bread"" it's all about healing and it's good but getting a little dry. I just need to bang it out. 
I'm thinking that I like this Blog thing. 
In His Grip,

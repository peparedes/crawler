Tonight. Angiogram. Head. Neck. done and done. Lord willing it will show something. ANYTHING!! I'll take anything. Lots of prayer is being prayed. I know. Thank you.

Cats, check. Good. We're good. Lots of headaches, check. Good. School starting up? Check. Yup. Teacher's orders? Check! Christmas in the office, says I! 

New tattoo - check! I love it. Ask me about it some time. 

Peace friends"

"event","It's been an interesting few weeks... School is seriously ramping up, the headache of doom was there for a while too. It's not even august and i really feel like the summer is almost over! i have a ton to do at work, and really need to settle into a routine for life. Here's what I've got so far, tell me what you think: (i mean that)
wake up: 6:25
read/journal/meditate: 6:30-7:15
get ready for day and leave by work at 7:45
work 8:00-4:00 (for fall)
go ""out"" one evening per week (probably bible study)
dinner at 6:00
wind down around 9:00 (this includes make lunch for next day!)
bed at 10:00

fun, huh? I feel like I'm either 9 or 90, I can't tell. I kinda like it, but it feels a little restricting. No more caffiene for me these days too, which makes 10 feel pretty good for bed :)

Renee came back into town breifly last night (and for today) and while listening to some of her stories last night I realized that what I really want out of life is to ENJOY and be content with less and less. To live much more simply with my time, my space, my money, my thoughts. All of that. Yoga, meditation, twelve steps, I think they all get us to the same place - serenity, and I think serenity is necessarily simpler. right? O_O"

"event","Trying to buy coffee, when you haven't had any coffee, can be a grueling and emberassing experience. I had no cream (cookies for my cream? anyone?) and thus could not drink my coffee. I know, I know, I should bite the bullet, be cool like everyone else and drink black coffee. I rebel against the system!! Ha ha! Anyway. Of course I know where every coffee shop is within a 2 mile radius, but their store hours? TOTALLY different story. Plus I kinda wanna support(a) the small ones (eek to the starbucks and seattle's best - plus, if I went to seattle's best, I would buy books...) This was also about 7:15 in the morning. I should have gone to Taza D'Oro, but alas, I wanted to actually head in the direction of work. Not away. Even a half mile, that's too much to ask pre-coffee. (I love that I can't think rationally without coffee so therefore went about as far away as I could out of my way, when really I should have just gone to Taza) (I have now had my coffee and can think logically)

Right. Sooo... (Really, If you've read this far, I'm impressed) I tried Oh, Yeah. I really wanted to buy yummy organic, fair trade, cute guy serving me, coffee from them, but nooooo. Not open til 8! I need coffee before 8! !!!  !!!

So then, I've already set out on the coffee mission, with no coffee, so I can't give up now. So Walnut St. Jitters? NO. Creepy, creepy guy reading newspaper in front, must walk around, don't make eye contact. ew! don't look at my legs! yuck! Sorry. Okay. Coffee Tree Roasters? YES! Garage door of ventilation OPEN! Coffee! $1.50 later I have what I need, go back past creepy newspaper guy, and sip my coffee. all is right with the world, and I am not even late to work, even though I went about 1.5 miles out of my way. Oops. I'll know better next time. 

Watch for more, I'm onna roll."

"event","I've had my three cups&nbsp;of coffee, slept an extra 20 minutes today, and haven't had breakfast yet. Here are some (early) morning thoughts.

I love the people in my life. I wish that I could spend more time with everyone and give more of myself. Except I can't. Shoot. I'm really struggling to figure out&nbsp;how to balance (ha ha!) my life right now. I've just moved to an apt&nbsp;by myself, and of course I'm worried about getting lonely, but shoot, I've had people over EVERY night. This is good, but I'm feeling the need to spend some time there - with myself...These are the times I appreciate people who can come and sit and don't&nbsp;need entertained. There are lots of people I enjoy, but&nbsp;I feel like it's rare to find people you don't have to entertain (thank you Timothy!!).&nbsp;

Balance? ELUSIVE!! Will I ever be someone who leads a balanced life? Maybe. I was talking with Jess about her life in Guate and really impressed with the balance she has found - I want that!! I think it has a lot to do with her simplifying. I want to do this, but I'm not sure how. I want to walk more, buy less, grow more (veggies), read more, write more, grow more (myself), and be more hospitible. Yikes. Tall order there friend. Oops. I have lots of those, tall orders...shoot. Can I just accept, today, my pendulum swinging self, and love&nbsp;myself where I am today? Hopefully.

Peace.&nbsp;"

Who knows! Hopefully brother dearest will help me. :)

In other news, I met my upstairs neighbor! It's nice to know the people I'm living around are pretty great. I actually had coffee with Ann (Landlord) for 2 or so hours yesterday, that was pretty great!! I keep being afraid that I didn't actually tell them&nbsp;I have cats, but i know I did, cuz we joked about it. And I do love the kitchen!&nbsp;

"event","It's been quite a ride over the past few weeks. I've been learning the ropes at PUCS, packing to move soon, hanging out more and more, and house-sitting. I feel really content right now, and have a pretty serious assuredness that I am in the right place right now. Lots of things on my mind, of course, but God is so good, and taking good care of me. I look forward to another week of work, trying to figure more out, and more summer hanging out. Peace!"

"event","It was a grand day in the city. It was purposeful, yet slow enough to enjoy everything. Even the humidity and heat. I got lots of moments to pause and think, and lots of movement, which is good too. I learned how to tune up a bike! yay! (thanks quinn!!) and I walked in the woods for a while, and drank red bean tea. it was pretty glorious.

Last night was the Over the Rhine show, which was amazing. Karin's voice just makes me melt. and want to dance. and make out with poeple. oh wait, what?? right.

We went to Fat Heads afterward, which was actually really chill and fun. I ran into some Hot Metal people, and it was just so great, to be in the city - running into people and being out in the city at night. it was good. 

Hopefully tomorrow I will get to ride my bike (i'm shooting for 9:30am) before it gets too hot...then some writing, and MASSAGE! yay! the day has come.

please excuse the excessive amounts of punctuation in this post. :)"

"event","The kids are gone, the music is playing, the coffee is being drunk...ahhhh...summer is here.

First day on the job alone...went well. It was SO quiet, but good to feel comfortable, no fear of puking children running into the office. It was good. I'm still feeling a little heartbroken about the penguins, but I'm sure I'll get over it. I was thinking today about the irony of the hockey season just being over, and how RIDICULOUSLY hot and humid it was today. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it's warm, but geez...the office? A SWEAT BOX!!! I have to try and look cute, and have breathable, comfortable clothes on? shoot. 

the pool ministry will begin for me on monday...

oh. and PACKING. i hate it.

more fragments! maybe a bike on sat??"

"event","Last night was really hard for me. I was really shaken up after we got back from our Deacon training...<br /><br />Walking over to the UP I received some unwelcome attention from an adoring onlooker...I do like feeling beautiful, but I do NOT like having people swear at me about it....or follow me down the street asking for my number. I'm not being melodramatic. This happened, and it was weird and unwelcome. <br /><br /><i>Then </i>we went up into Garfield Heights, which is all fine and dandy, but we were going <font color=""#99cc00""><u><i>*door to door*</i></u> </font>(note looking of terror and turning green). So I went with John, I thought this would be the most comfortable for me, knowing he hates it too, and wouldn't make me talk to people...which he didn't, and I'm thankful for that. The first house we went to, no one was home...this was the one home John really wanted to stop at, because she lives right next to the vacant lot that we're trying to garden on. (Oh, right, we're doing all this to survey the neighborhood about how they feel about us gardening in the vacant lots behind their houses) The next house, a young kid answered the door, which was fine, but he looked terrified, and told us his parents were sleeping - who knows what that meant, but he looked so scared, and it broke my heart. Then we went to two houses, the first of which the man just wrote us off, and basically asked us to leave - very politely though. The second man tried to hide from us, by going back in his house while we walked up the stairs, John talked to him anyway. He told us we could do whatever we want, and went back inside. Still not so disheartening, mostly normal for door to door action. The next houses absolutely broke my heart. <br /><br />The man was standing in a window, and when John asked him about the garden, he said ""I don't even think about that"" - which, listening between the lines, made me think about all the shit going on in their lives, and how of course they didn't worry about what the vacant properties would turn into. There is so much more to worry about. He had a great smile though, and laughed when John asked him if he would like us to bring him some fresh vegetables (he did think this was a good idea I think). The next place we stopped had a group of teenagers, who I, very honestly, was terrified of, but John was very patient (I could learn a lot, right?) (there are too many commas there) and they were really disrespectful, and clearly didn't want us there, and one of them hit on me, and ugh. Again. Broken heart. The next house we stopped at, a group of adults were sitting at (very high) and we talked to them pleasantly enough, but the man started asking about whether or not we had ID...that was just weird. I started to laugh, realized he was serious, and felt very foolish and out of place. <br /><br />I wanted to cry. I don't understand how these things happen...how cities become this, how we are so broken, with no one to lift us up. I am this person too, I am not better than any of the people we met tonight, I am equally fucked up...We a just broken in different ways...and it hurts my heart. <br /><br />I don't know how to be a deacon. It's the same reason I didn't want to be a social worker, because at the end of the day my heart is broken. My father commented to me that I have been given the responsibility to see the broken things because I can handle them, because I can pray, <i>because </i>it breaks my heart. And this just hurts more. I don't know how to hurt for the world, and still have hope. I guess we just cling to Jesus."

Writing you say? I like this whole ""just write when you feel like it, and don't worry about what comes out"" thing...but it's just funny to think about writing... i don't think i'm a writer - but i secretly want to be. The reason I don't think I'm a writer, is because I don't think I could ever feel comfortable letting someone read anything I've written. i have journals upon journals of poetry, that I'm pretty sure NO ONE has ever seen... that would be too weird right?

Other 'w"" words.... Waiting for ""W"" to leave! Only 270 days left...although I'm not sure how hopeful to feel about what's coming next. Wishing - timothy and I talked about this last night, and you'll know what I'm talking about when I say I'm wishing for chapter 11 and the continuation of the saga. and a happy ending!!

"event","So. We (you know who you are) made a pact (? not really, I'm just being dramatic) to walk more places, because really, nothing we go to is very far away. Americans drive too much. Those jerks : / 

The more important point is I found a website ""mapmyrun"" (something like that in the title) which helped me to figure out how many miles it is depending on how I decide to walk to work. Mostly it's about 3.5, which took me about an hour last time, although I'm hoping to cut down on that tomorrow...although, if i walk first thing in the morning, Lord knows I'll be slower. 

But anyway, i feel good about this so called ""pact"", it feels good to be walking so much of my day! It makes me feel like I'm doing my part to save the planet. ha ha, right, it's all going to pot anyway. Not really, I know one person deciding to walk can make a difference, it just feels feeble that's all. Really i should bike. I LOVE biking, i just hate hills, and i live at the top of a big hill. plus drivers here are stupid, and i think they like hitting people on bikes. maybe they think it's a game. well...we'll see what happens. A lot will depend on how much sleep I have."

It was interesting, basically the consensus was that it didn't matter what form the announcement came in, but your relationship to that person. I think this is CRAP. The informality of an e-mail engagement announcement, or birth announcement, or whatever, SO informal...I don't feel the need to send gifts, or even respond to these announcements!!! Ack!!!

"event","well where do i start? This has started off as the worst day, well not THE worst but close enough.  I tried to get to sleep early in the night, get like 2 hours maybe 3 in before work but that didnt help, partly due to my stupidness and jsut because when i finally lay down my stupid ass can't fall asleep.  So i finally fall asleep i wake up with only 10 mins to get to work and well work is like a 30 min drive and then a 10 mins walk. I get in there and my new dock manager, who i swear is straight from South Africa or somewhere , because he barely speaks above a normal tone and i can barely understand him with hi accent.  I over look the yelling jsut because i know he means well hes new for chrsit sake, but still didnt need to ehar it.  
Of course we're runing all premiums in my load area so like all but 4 out of 15 shuts are backed up with only 4 guys working the shuts.  I alone deal with 6 of those damn trailers so ya hoo.. my ass is slamed with boxes all morning and when i finally leave i find out i was there for 6 hours.  Now thats cool because thats alot of money but also it atleast went by fast.  Yes i know i piss and moan in this fucking entry alot, kiss my fucking ass and then suck it ok.  No really i love ya who read this, which isnt many so thats good.  

Now i get to go out buy mat board, mat some art work, work on a brand new drawing and then try to get it all into school before 5 or so, and then i'll finally be able to sleep.  Fuck it i aint doing the other drawing.. i cant stand this shit anymore.. i'm going crazy.. this 3rd shift is wearing on me.. i'm going insane from other shit in my life, personal and all that crap.. christ i want to scream.  I'll go scream now.."

"event","Ok i'm writing this entry early in the morning.  I just got off work so i'm freaking worn out but of course i can't sleep right now and heres why, and if you don't give a shit well then suck my ______ ! I ended up not geting asleep yesterday until like 2:30 or so and ended up sleeping til 3:38 which is about 15 mins before i need to leave for work.  So neededless to say i was rushing and gfeting ready and found myself being wide awake.  Which anyone should be after geting more than 12 hours of sleep damnit.  So right now i'm thinking i'll go into the bank deposit some checks, maybe acutally eat, another thing that seems to be missing alot from my routines.  HA oh well life goes on and another tv show comes along ya know.  speaking of tv shows, I'm really in the mood to watch Saved By the Bell.  Yeah yeah kiss my white ass, that show fucking kicked so much ass, i learned all about highschool before evening being there myself.  If ti wasnt for Zack, Kelly, Slater, Screech, Jesse and Lisa i'd never have known what to expect.  Like those social interactions with friends at the bottom of the stiars and discussing the big major problem of the day... who will it ake to the school dance.. oh no!  OR what about things like oh no so and so my best friend is totally addicted on caffine pills.. what will i ever do, i'm so scared for her or him.  I say her or him cause ya know we all got firends of both sexes.. speaKing of sex.. no i won't go there.. not yet but you all wait and see!"

And I sobbed into your ear, some pearl seashell.

My monthly trip to Raleigh proved very beneficial.  I sort of reminded myself of how much beauty there is in everything, and I realized I must have abandoned my cynical stage with the ludicrous tales I told when I was fourteen.

<b>EDIT:</b> I made a community <lj user=""unrefinedbeauty"">, and if you enjoy that kind of stuff, please join.  I know it probably doesn't apply to many of you, but if you know anyone who finds ossified black gum on cement or magazine pages where paint brushes were once wiped clean to be gorgeous, please direct them there. 
And then I made <lj user=""insomniartists""> (on which I have yet to actually work) for those 3am rounds with <lj user=""raretext"">, <lj user=""soretango"">, (and whoever else is bored enough) of raping Paint for our own selfish needs to awe each other with shitty drawings.  I made it a private community, so to become a member (not that you'd want to) you just have to be up late enough to participate.

I finally put my screen printing set to use today.  I think it turned out okay.  I will soon start making them to sell and give to people.  If you have any suggestions for t-shirts, tell me.

They'll be professionally processed Kodak prints- real pictures.  4x6
If this works out, I can maybe start making larger prints.

I'm going to get some done this week and see how they turn out.  If they're worth anything, and if anyone is interested, I might sell them for a low price.

But it's either this or these one sentence things I've been posting.
It's not that I'm too busy or lazy or have no personality...
Okay, it's the last one.  And the fact that I don't do shit.

Well, I was going to put some lame survey thing in here, but I realised I've already done it in the past.

Okay, I'll make this something real.  I've been feeling like shit lately because I can't talk to Tom anymore.  He's one of my favourite people in the whole world, and I understand that it's better for him that we don't talk, but I'm just feeling really selfish and immature right now and I'm torn up about it.

I've been trying to take pictures, but I've been really out of it lately.
Nothing looks good.
I made a new DA account since I need to get out of Tom's life.  It's loserly.deviantart.com.  I considered making a loserly LJ, too, but I know how much moving *again* would piss everyone on my friends list off.
And I haven't felt very artistic since I broke up with Tom.  I don't think I can ever feel like 'painting' again.  Maybe I'm just finally able to look back on my stupid pictures and realise they're shit.

This all turned out to be a self-pity fest, but it's not like the title didn't warn you.

Time to go play some more Grim Fandango.

Oh, and I'm going to remove everyone from my friends list who hasn't added me back soon.  It's too much for me to read, and I don't know of any way to do this that makes more sense.


I just found out that one of my favourite actors of all time, Marlon Brando, passed away last night.  Compound my sadness."

       Today:
Stay in to play video games and study tinp.  Watch Samurai Rebellion and eat some sushi.  Watch Trading Spaces Unglued and then the King Arthur special on the History Channel.  I could have taken today to hang out with some friends before I leave to San Antonio, but I have my priorities.  (I'm actually going to be around a bit longer after I come back from San Antonio.)  Ryan and I will most likely be staying here until we get enough money to get our own place in Seattle.  Funny how my plans did a complete 360.


       Tomorrow:
Go to Raleigh for my appointment.  Pack.  Play more video games and work more on tinp.  (Remember, pack will probably come last of all these.)


       Day After Tomorrow:
Leave for San Antonio until July 26.

On my site.


I've been spending time with my brother while he has been visiting.  He leaves tomorrow.
We've been mostly playing video games and watching a plethora of movies.  I could tell you what I thought of them all, but I'm not that sort.

I suppose this is as good a time as any to conclude my brief hiatus from 'the outside world.'  I'm still going to distance myself from those who brandish pretentious dispositions.  Do not mistake this as any deficit of discretion.

Today I saw a pied cockatiel who loved to sing and murmur, and I saw a grey tabby kitten who loved to sleep and occasionally mind me with one half-opened beryl eye.


And how are you?"

My dad got me a ticket to go to Lollapalooza in NY.  It's one of the few shows where the Pixies will be playing.  I'm still not quite sure on how I'm going to get there yet.  I could either be going with Tom or <lj user=""flugbild""> because <lj user=""lord_bullgod""> wimped out (>P),  but we're all pretty poor right now, so we'll see.

What can I say?  I was doing jack shit.  Which apparently angered Tom.  But I broke things off with jack shit, because Tom told me he was a low-life, so Tom and I are okay now.  I'm currently just doing nothing.

I did, however, somewhat finish my site.  All  I have to do is put up the stock, so it's nothing, really.

My nose has been hurting a lot lately, because my medicine has me all dried out while I'm having sinus problems thanks to wonderful springtime allergies.  Fucking plants.

I've also decided I'm going to indulge any culinary appetence which may wrench me.  My logic supports the notion that when I move to Philly, I'll eat very little and lose lots of weight.  So just why the fuck not?

Go check out my redesigned site and leave any suggestions or comments or whatever here.  <lj user=""nouse_for_tears""> already suggested I add some boobs, so I think I'll put some in there subliminally soon.

So today I went to help my mother at her work all day.  I <i>meant</i> to go Wednesday, but I didn't feel like getting dressed.  Then I slept all day on Thursday.  So I went today, and of all days, the last day for seniors (my assigned graduating class.)  I suppose the significance of this date made everyone very emotional.  People whom I had not touched in my six years of knowing them were approaching me with open arms and the appropriate accompanying greeting, ""Give me a hug!""  I also received much contact info along with the proper, ""Let's get together before you leave!"" to boot.  It's not that I abhor polite white lies to such a degree, (okay, I do, but not necessarily the people who tell them...) but more I don't want to have to guess at who candidly meant what he/she was professing.

I am now very tired.  And quite honestly, even the notion of ""hanging out"" with people before I leave... it tires me further.  Truly, how will I ever make it once I move to Philly and have to give up my hermit ways?  You guys better be nice to me!

I'm redesigning my site.  Expect it to be up this week sometime.

Well, I have some pretty goddamn <b>big</b> news.

My mom bought me my ticket to Philly today.  To move there.  On August 1st.

Holy shit.

I'm really scurred and thrilled at the same time.  I've decided that moving into an apartment with <lj user=""flugbild""> is the best thing to do once I get to Philly.  So now he and I have to get really serious about finding a place and jobs and all that shit.  My mom seems to have come around, and I know she'll help me out with cash if I need it.  -BUT-  I know I have to try to be more responsible, and I feel subjecting myself to an entirely new environment might be the type of rude awakening I need to jolt myself into some form of positive acceleration.

In other news, there isn't much other news.  I'm ensnared in the lull present just before the crash of breakers on the shore.  This June, Jessica will be moving even further away from me- to Hawaii.  At least I'll be able to go visit her, though funds and schedules will endorse indubitably less frequent vacations.

<lj-cut text=""Blather concerning my summer/after-summer plans."">The very beginning of August promises my final step in moving to Philadelphia.  I'll either be able to stay with Tom, which would actually be in Philly, or if that doesn't pan out I'll be residing with Ryan in South Jersey near northeast Philly (it's too expensive to actually move into the city for us kids, I believe.)  
Any which way, I'll be there for good by then.  I can't go any earlier and miss my mother's birthday in late July (which means I'll miss Sergio's, but that's just a reason for another party!)  I definitely have to be there before Tom's birthday, and any later would make it hard to prepare myself to start school in the fall and get a job and all that jazz.  </lj-cut>

Now I'm all talked out.  So expect updates I make presently to consist of more photography."

<b>3. Would you marry for money?</b>
Possibly.  I doubt it, though.  I'm not a very materialistic person.
<b>4. Have you had braces?</b>
Yeah, not too long ago.  I still have to wear a retainer for some time.
<b>5. Do you pluck your eyebrows?</b>
Sparsely.
<b>6. Do you ever cut or hurt yourself?</b>
I take nearly scalding hot showers.  I've been doing it for years, now, so it's what I'm used to doing.  It started out as a way to hurt myself, though. 
<b>7. When was the last time you had a hickey?</b>
Never.
<b>8. Could you live without a computer?</b>
Yes, but I'd have to live pretty far away from civilization. 
<b>9. Do you use ICQ, AOL Buddy list etc...?</b>
Yes.
<b>10. What is your fav. quote?</b>
I have too many... so... uh... 
""Which one of us is not forever a stranger and alone?"" -Thomas Wolfe
<b>11. If you could live in any past time period, which would it be?</b>
Hrm.  Medieval times are intriguing, but I doubt it'd be that fun to live in them.  Ancient Greece and Rome also had many discouraging aspects, but I think I'd want to live then just to live among some of the greatest minds in our human history.
<b>12. Do you drink enough water?</b>
I mainly drink water, but I sure as hell don't drink 8 8-ounce portions a day or whatever ridiculous amount they expect me to consume.
<b>13. Do you wear shoes in the house or take them off?</b>
I'd take it ALL off if I could.   But shoes are pretty constraining. 
<b>14. What is your favorite fruit?</b>
Peaches.
<b>15. Do you eat wheat bread or white?</b>
Wheat, because that's what's here.  I don't know what I'd prefer.
<b>16. What is your favorite place to visit?</b>
I enjoyed visiting Russia more than I enjoyed visiting Hawaii.  I'm weird, I know, but I supposed that'd have to be Russia, then, because I have fond memories of Germany, but I was too young to really remember.
<b>17. What is the last movie you saw?</b>
Kill Bill Vol. 2
<b>18. Do you kiss on the first date?</b>
I've never really been on a date- just hung out with guys.  But no, I don't kiss people unless I really know them and like them a lot, because I'm not big on kissing.
<b>19. Are you photogenic?</b>
Absolutely not.
<b>20. Do you dream in color or black and white?</b>
Colour.  I can only recall maybe one black and white dream.  Hell, I even dream <i>about</i> colours.  I know I'm weird. 
<b>21. Are you wearing fingernail polish?</b>
No.
<b>22. Is it chipped or fresh?</b>
If I was, it would be chipped.  I hate that shit, but sometimes I feel compelled to wear it.  Stupid girls.
<b>23. Do you have any dimples?</b>
Yeah, but I never knew until some woman pointed it out to me a year ago.
<b>24. Do you remember being born?</b>
No, and I don't think it's possible.  Who would want to remember such a revolting experience, anyways?
<b>25. Why do you take surveys?</b>
Because I hate your mom's face.
<b>26. Do you drink alcohol?</b>
Yeah, but not enough to get drunk.
<b>27. Did you like or do you like high school?</b>
It wasn't a harrowing experience for me.  People were nice to me and all, but they just annoyed me.  I graduated early because it was a waste of my time, and if I'm going to waste my time, I'd rather be playing video games and chatting with morons on IRC.
<b>28. What is the most beautiful language?</b>
Spanish.
<b>29. When you are asleep do you like being kissed awake?</b>
Well, I'd have to experience that to know for sure.
<b>30. Do you like sunrises or sunsets the most?</b>
Sunrises always signify the end of the night/my day.  Sunsets are the beginning, and always more beautiful.
<b>31. Do you want to live to be 100?</b>
Fuck no.  I'm eager to find out what's waiting after death, even if it's nothingness.
<b>32. Do you think women should be expected to shave their body hair?</b>
Sure, but I think we should put more weight as a society on men shaving their body hair, too.  Why should girls have to deal with that shit while they have to go to such lengths to please men?
<b>33. Do you like salty food or sugary food the most?</b>
Well, I eat salty and it makes me crave sweet, and vice versa.  So I never know.
<b>34. Is a flat stomach important to you?</b>
Not at all.  A little tummy is nice.
<b>35. Are you loyal?</b>
Yes.
<b>36. Are you tolerant of other people's beliefs?</b>
Yep.  As long as they aren't close-minded.
<b>37. When you watch movies at home, do you like the lights on or off?</b>
Off, definitely.
<b>38. Do you believe in magic?</b>
In video games, fuck yeah.  Though I usually end up just pressing the attack button through whole battles in really easy RPGs and such.
<b>39. Do you have nightmares frequently?</b>
I used to.  I used to have night terrors, too.  Now they're only semi-frequent. 
<b>40. Do you like your nose?</b>
Nope.  It's an ugler.  Stupid Jews.
<b>41. Do you like abstract art?</b>
Very much so.
<b>42. Do you think you can draw well?</b>
No.  I wish I could.  My brother is really really good and is always like, ""It's easy, just do this and this and this.""  And I get so lost.
<b>43. Do you listen to music daily?</b>
I listen to it all the time.  I bet it's annoying to people because I also feel compelled to sing a lot, too.
<b>44. Do you like to watch cartoons?</b>
Do I ever.
<b>45. At what age did you find out that Santa Clause wasn't real?</b>
I was four.  I've always had insomnia, and when I was little I would creep around the house.  So of course, on Christmas, I saw my parents putting all the presents under the tree.
<b>46. How many pairs of shoes do have in your closet?</b>
Well, most of them are scattered... let me go count... okay, I counted all the shoes I still wear.  Forty-three.
<b>47. Do you like to wear the same shoes everyday or do you like a variety?</b>
Well, I obviously enjoy a variety, but laziness and convenience force me to wear basically the same three pairs of tennis shoes every day.
<b>48. Do you write poetry?</b>
I used to when I was like, fourteen.  Sometimes I think about giving it a shot again, but I bet it'd still be wretched.
<b>49. Do you snore?</b>
No.
<b>50. Do you sleep more on your back, front, or sides?</b>
Back and sides.  I can't sleep on my stomach.  I like facing the wall.
<b>51. Would you rather have a poodle or a rottweiler?</b>
Neither.  I don't want a large dog I wouldn't be able to control, and poodles are fucking stupid.  Do you mean toy poodle?  Because poodles are pretty big.
<b>52. Do you lick stamps?</b>
I never send letters.
<b>53. Do you use an electric can opener?</b>
I don't use cans.
<b>54. Have you ridden in a hot air balloon? </b>
No.  It might be nice in some place like Scotland or something.  I don't know.
<b>55. Which hurts the most, physical or emotional pain?</b>
Emotional.
<b>56. Do you think balding men should shave their heads?</b>
I think everyone should shave their heads.  It'd help everyone save so much money and they wouldn't need to use hairspray.  Beauticians wouldn't earn more than teachers, and maybe they'd all have to be come teachers and we wouldn't have such a shortage.
Alas, we are all far too vain for such an idea to be feasible.
<b>57. Do you know anyone who is clinically depressed?</b>
Clinically doesn't mean shit to me.  But yeah, I've known some pretty depressed fuckers in my time.
<b>58. Do you prefer a piano or a violin? </b>
Cello.  But I had to get a keyboard for the range when I write music.
<b>59. Are you a sex addict?</b>
Yeah.  I'm one of those addicts who has never tried that to which they are addicted.
<b>60. Do you know someone who has cancer?</b>
I've had a number of loved ones die because of cancer, and I bet that's how I'll die, too.
<b>62. Do you hunt?</b>
Fuck no.
<b>63. Do you like fast food joints, or expensive restaurants?</b>
Fast food is one of those things I eat if I HAVE to.  And even then, there's not much I eat, being a vegetarian and all.  Fast food salads are gross, bite me.  I also don't like expensive restaurants.  I dunno.  Diners are nice.
<b>64. Would you rather visit a zoo or an art museum?</b>
Depends on my mood, but most of the time it would be art.
<b>65. Do you have a middle name?</b>
Nicole.
<b>66. Are you basically a happy person?</b>
Nope.  But I don't act unhappy.
<b>67. Are you tired?</b>
Of your face?  Yes.
<b>68. Did you drink anything with caffeine in it today?</b>
No.  I consume amazingly small amounts of caffeine for today's standards.
<b>70. How many phones do you have in your house?</b>
Two, and they're both cell phones.
<b>71. How long is your hair?</b>
Long enough to donate to locks of love and then have enough to be about shoulder length.  It used to be like, past my knees when I was little.
<b>72. Do you get along with your parents?</b>
Yes.  My parents are really great.
<b>73. What color of eyes do you prefer?</b>
Brown, I suppose.  Hazel/Green is nice, too.
<b>74. Are you awesome?</b>
I dunno... are you in awe of me?
<b>75. What medications do you take?</b>
I used to be on seven pills a day for all my ailments.  Then I realized I'd rather have them than deal with that shit.  I hate pills.  So right now I only take accutane and sometimes albuterol.
<b>76. What does your bedroom look like?</b>
It's an ugler of a room for an ugler of a girl.  I like it better now that it has hardwood floors.  What I love most about my room is all the electronic devices it contains for my amusement, not its aesthetic amenities.
<b>77. What are your wishes? </b>
To be in Philly and to find something in which I can truly excel.
<b>78. But if you could only have one wish to come true, which wish would you wish for?</b>
The latter.  I can always just make my way to Philly.
<b>80. If you could help anyone in the world.. even give up something so precious to you.. who would you help?</b>
Everyone.
<b>81. Do you sleep with stuffed animals?</b>
Not anymore.
<b>82. Do you have a dream that keeps coming back?</b> 
Yeah, I've had those.  The most recent ones have been of burning cities.
<b>83. Do you play an instrument?</b>
Cello, piano, teaching myself electric bass.
<b>84. Do you believe there is life on other planets?</b>
Yes yes yes.  I have many theories related to these beliefs. 
<b>85. Do you read the newspaper?</b>
Yeah, sometimes.  The ink gives me a headache, though.
<b>86. Do you have any gay or lesbian friends?</b>
Of course.  Which apparently is rare in North Carolina.
<b>87. Do you believe in miracles?</b>
No.  But I believe in synchronicity.
<b>89. Do you consider yourself tolerant of cops?</b>
Uh... sure?  I've never dealt with cops... unless you mean the tv show, in which case, no.  It bores me.
<b>90. Do you like the taste of alcohol?</b>
Yes.  I abhor cheap beer, though.
<b>91. Do you believe in astrology?</b>
Jesus, no.  The stars have shifted in the thousands of years since its founding, you know.  The sign you think is your star sign isn't even correct.
<b>92. Do you believe in magic?</b>
... why is this question here twice?  Do you think I'm that vertiginous an individual?
<b>93. Do you pray?</b>
No.
<b>94. Do you go to church/temple?</b>
Resolutely not.
<b>95. Do you have any secrets?</b>
No.  I'm a really open, honest person, which can ofttimes cause me trouble.
<b>96. Do you have any pets?</b>
A cat and a dog and two fish.  I decided today I want another tarantula, but I probably won't get one for another few years.  I also REALLY want another cockatiel.
<b>97. Do you go to or plan to go to college?</b>
I really wish I wasn't, but I guess I am.  I turned down full scholarships because I KNOW I don't want to go to a normal University.  If anything, I'll be in film school.
<b>98. What major?</b>
Cinematography.
<b>99. Are you hot?</b>
No, I've been cold all day.  And if you mean the other kind of ""hot"" the answer remains unwavering.
<b>100. Favorite brand of tissue?</b>
The ones in FFVII because they're sneaky little fuckers.
<b>101. Do you have any piercings?</b>
Just my ears.
<b>102. Do you hate yourself?</b>
I used to.  I'm pretty content with myself by now.
<b>103. Do you wish on stars?</b>
No.  But I used to a lot.
<b>104. Do you believe in ghosts?</b>
I believe in supernatural phenomena, but I don't know if I'd call them ghosts, or if I'd even give them any definition.
<b>105. Do you like sarcasm?</b> 
I guess so.  People always say I'm very sarcastic, but I never notice it.
<b>106. Do you take walks in the rain?</b>
They're great.  The last one I took was the best.
<b>107. Do you sing in the shower?</b>
I sure do.</lj-cut>"

My trip to Raleigh which continued to Smithfield in an attempt to see the Ava Gardner Museum, which was closing too soon to the time I arrived to bother paying the $5 to go in, anyways, was about a 70 song trip on my iPod.  So I figured I'd share with you the first 20 songs, no matter how embarassing, on that random playlist, because apparently that's a trendy thing to do, and we all know how crazy I am about appearing trendy, and run-on sentences utilizing too many commas.

I'm really striving to get to Philly as soon as I can.
Things are going relatively well so far.

I'm going to try to go to the Ava Gardner museum tomorrow on the way back from my appointment.
Then Tuesday I'll pick up a lot more applications and turn them in presently.


I'm going to go watch DVDs."

In other news, my planning a trip to PA this week has been stressful, to say the very least.
I think everything has finally been worked out, but it took like, two-three days and going back and forth between six different people or whatever.

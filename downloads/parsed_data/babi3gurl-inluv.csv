"event","I haven't updated this thingy in a while so here it goes.... 

I've been pretty bored lately with the March break being so crappy, and the easter weekend the same so I've just been sitting on ma ass infront of the computer the whole time. My visit to Buffalo was crap too cause I got nothing, the only good thing was I got to spend time with my bestest friends Rayyane:D.
My Easter weekend was a disaster...big family crisis...won't go into detail but at the end it was reallly messed up. Seriously my family has some issues to work out, I don't understand why they get so worked up for a stupid decision or problem. They don't know how to work things out like human beings. But whatever....I'm actually looking forward to school!8-| Anyways, I think that's it for me to write so ya...Peace!"

"event","Seriously sum anonymous ppl who reply to my entries are soo ignorant..if u don't have anything nice to say just do not leave anything. Is it that hard to do that. Like wats your deal, you have no life that you bud into other peoples lives?? then you leave your comments anonymous..like if you got something to say at least show who the f'k u. And about the weed shit, ok i know its the safest drug or whatever but like c'mon there are people who can still get sick from it, no drug can be safe. So please, just do not post anything if you have nothing nice to post, just keep your comments to yourself. And if you do; don't keep it anonymous..tell me who you are...im out!"

"event","Today was soo boring...went to yorkdale with my mother, she took forever in the Bay, she bought like the whole store. Anyways, then my mother went to bluenotes and I saw Daniela working there, i talked to her for a while as my mother was roaming the store finding clothes again. Finally left and went to all these places like leaons, and the brick and my mother was laying down on all the mattresses there, took her forever to get out of that store. Now I am at her friends house and of course my mother is talking away with her friends while I am bored out of mind right now! But thats okay. I'm sorta feeling better today, but I'm still a bit sad, but my bordem is kinda over powering my saddness right now so ya. Hope I go home soon..."

"event","oo my im soo f'kin bored. i want to do something today but i cant go anywhere. stupid life, cant do nothing anymore...especially with my sister always on top of me watching my every move. also, if it isnt bad enough shes sleeping in my room now. i let her stay in there for one night, on sunday cause my dad was using her computer, but now she wont leave. shes like attached to me, she ruins everything. it might sound like im the meaner twin, but no one i mean NO ONE will be as miserable as me right now. maybe thats why i dont have no motive for life anymore..cuz im F'KIN GLUED TO THE HOUSE AND CAN NEVER HAVE A LIFE!!!. OK im good, but seriously i want to have a life again when i have some control in the decisions my family makes, now wherever they go im dragged with them,even if i hate where we're going im forced to go, for example skiing at horseshoe valley. probably this week ill be dragged to my mothers friends house, and watch my mom play that stupid game for like a million years again. i need my life back! its horrible having even kim control my decisions, like parties and such, she never wants to go. GRRRRRRR.......life sucks, someone help me!!"

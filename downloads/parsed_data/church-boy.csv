Yes? 
Don't interrupt me. I'm praying. 
But -- you called ME! 
Called you? 
No, I didn't call you. 
I'm praying. 
Our Father who art in Heaven. 
There -- you did it again! 
Did what? 
Called ME. 
You said, 
""Our Father who art in Heaven"" 
Well, here I am. 
What's on your mind? 
But I didn't mean anything by it. 
I was, you know, just saying my prayers for the day. 
I always say the Lord's Prayer. 
It makes me feel good, 
kind of like fulfilling a duty. 
Well, all right. 
Go on. 
Okay, Hallowed be thy name . . 
Hold it right there. 
What do you mean by that? 
By what? 
By ""Hallowed be thy name""? 
It means, it means . . good grief, 
I don't know what it means. 
How in the world should I know? 
It's just a part of the prayer. 
By the way, what does it mean? 
It means honored, holy, wonderful. 
Hey, that makes sense. 
I never thought about what 'hallowed' meant before. 
Thanks. 
Thy Kingdom come, 
Thy will be done, 
on earth as it is in Heaven. 
Do you really mean that? 
Sure, why not? 
What are you doing about it? 
Doing? Why, nothing, I guess. 
I just think it would be kind of neat if you got control, 
of everything down here like you have up there. 
We're kinda in a mess down here you know. 
Yes, I know; 
but, have I got control of you? 
Well, I go to church. 
That isn't what I asked you. 
What about your bad temper? 
You've really got a problem there, you know. 
And then there's the way you spend your money -- 
all on yourself. 
And what about the kind of books you read? 
Now hold on just a minute! 
Stop picking on me! 
I'm just as good as some of the rest of those people at church! 
Excuse ME. 
I thought you were praying 
for my will to be done. 
If that is to happen, 
it will have to start with the ones 
who are praying for it. 
Like you -- for example. 
Oh, all right. I guess I do have some hang-ups. 
Now that you mention  it, 
I could probably name some others. 
So could I. 
I haven't thought about it very much until now, 
but I really would like to cut out some of those things. 
I would like to, you know, be really free. 
Good. 
Now we're getting somewhere.We'll work together -- You and ME. 
I'm proud of You. 
Look, Lord, if you don't mind, 
I need to finish up here. 
This is taking a lot longer than it usually does. 
Give us this day, our daily bread. 
You need to cut out the bread. 
You're overweight as it is. 
Hey, wait a minute! What is this? 
Here I was doing my religious duty, 
and all of a sudden you break in 
and remind me of all my hang-ups. 
Praying is a dangerous thing. 
You just might get what you ask for. 
Remember, 
you called ME -- and here I am. 
It's too late to stop now. 
Keep praying.  ( . . pause . . ) 
Well, go on. 
I'm scared to. 
Scared? Of what? 
I know what you'll say. 
Try ME. 
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. 
What about Ann? 
See? I knew it! 
I knew you would bring her up! 
Why, Lord, she's told lies about me, spread stories. 
She never paid back the money she owes me. 
I've sworn to get even with her! 
But -- your prayer -- 
What about your prayer? 
I didn't -- mean it. 
Well, at least you're honest. 
But, it's quite a load carrying around all that bitterness 
and resentment isn't it? 
Yes, but I'll feel better as soon as I get even with her. 
Boy, have I got some plans for her. 
She'll wish she had never been born. 
No, you won't feel any better. 
You'll feel worse. 
Revenge isn't sweet. 
You know how unhappy you are -- 
Well, I can change that. 
You can? How? 
Forgive Ann. 
Then, I'll forgive you; 
And the hate and the sin, 
will be Ann's problem -- not yours. 
You will have settled the problem 
as far as you are concerned. 
Oh, you know, you're right. 
You always are. 
And more than I want revenge, 
I want to be right with You . . (sigh). 
All right . . all right . . 
I forgive her. 
There now! 
Wonderful! 
How do you feel? 
Hmmmm. Well, not bad. 
Not bad at all! 
In fact, I feel pretty great! 
You know, I don't think I'll go to bed uptight tonight. 
I haven't been getting much rest, you know. 
Yeah, I know. 
But, you're not through with your prayer are you? Go on. 
Oh, all right. 
And lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil. 
Good! Good! I'll do that. 
Just don't put yourself in a place 
where you can be tempted. 
What do you mean by that? 
You know what I mean. 
Yeah. I know. 
Okay. 
Go ahead. Finish your prayer. 
For Thine is the kingdom, 
and the power, 
and the glory forever. 
Amen. 
Do you know what would bring me glory -- 
What would really make me happy? 
No, but I'd like to know. 
I want to please you now. 
I've really made a mess of things. 
I want to truly follow you. 
I can see now how great that would be. 
So, tell me . . . 
How do I make you happy? 
YOU just did. 


 
 Have A Blessed Day"

Money has a great affect on life and everything. The whole world is all about money, you can't make it without money. The Devil always getting in the way with it try to brake up family, friendship, and relationship because of money. I have been crying over stuff like this because I don't have the money to pay for things in life. Times are getting hard specially when you have to help your mom pay for bills and give her money so that she can make it for the week. Some of my friends do thing same thing too or some of them can't go to school because they have to stay home and baby sit. But out of all this confusion I know that we need to pray for one another and God will bless us, He said ask and it shall be given unto you or we have not because we ask not.(St. Matthew 7:7)  We are to blessed to be stressed with all the devil mess:"

"event","Attending a wedding for the first time, a little girl whispered to her mother, ""Why is the bride dressed in white?"" Because white is the color of happiness, and today is the happiest day of her life."" The child thought about this for a moment, then said, ""So why is the groom wearing black?"" 
******************* 
A little girl, dressed in her Sunday best, was running as fast as she could, trying not to be late for Bible class. As she ran she prayed, ""Dear Lord, please don't let me be late! Dear Lord, please don't let me be late!"" While she was running and praying, she tripped on a curb and fell, getting her clothes dirty and tearing her dress. She got up, brushed herself off, and started running again. As she ran she once again began to pray, ""Dear Lord, please don't let me be late...But please don't shove me either!"" 
********************* 
Three boys are in the schoolyard bragging about their fathers. The first boy says, ""My Dad scribbles a few words on a piece of paper, he calls it a poem, they give him $50."" The second boy says, ""That's nothing. My Dad scribbles a few words on a piece of paper, he calls it a song, they give him $100."" The third boy says, ""I got you both beat. My Dad scribbles a few words on a piece of paper, he calls it a sermon. And it takes eight people to collect all the money!"" 
********************** 
An elderly woman died last month. Having never married, she requested no male pallbearers. In her handwritten instructions for her memorial service, she wrote, ""They wouldn't take me out while I was alive, I don't want them to take me out when I'm dead.

A police recruit was asked during the exam, ""What would you do if you had to arrest your own mother?"" He said, ""Call for backup."" 
********************** 
A Sunday School teacher asked her class why Joseph and Mary took Jesus with them to Jerusalem. A small child replied: ""They couldn't get a baby sitter."" 
************************ 
A Sunday school teacher was discussing the Ten Commandments with her five and six year olds. After explaining the commandment to ""honor thy father and thy mother,"" she asked ""Is there a commandment that teaches us how to treat our brothers and sisters?"" Without missing a beat one little boy answered, ""Thou shall not kill."" 
************************** 
At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's ribs. Later  the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he were ill, and said, ""Johnny, what is the matter?"" Little Johnny responded, ""I have pain in my side. I think I'm going to have a wife."" 
*********************** 
Two boys were walking home from Sunday school after hearing a strong preaching on the devil. One said to the other, ""What do you think about all this Satan stuff?"" The other boy replied, ""Well, you know how Santa Claus turned out. It's probably just your dad."""

"event","MOST POWERFUL thing I ever thought of 


I had on new clothes,
New sneakers on my feet.
I was there for class on time,
Went to the back and took my seat. 

Yeah, I'm moving up,
I'm already grown.
Soon I'll be graduating,
And out on my own. 

I talked to some of my friends,
We were all having fun.
Said some things I shouldn't have said. Did stuff I shouldn't have done. 

I knew I was different..
I felt God touch my heart,
I knew I should set a standard,
But then I'd be set apart. 

Walking to the bus, I was not looking for strength.
I heard the car tires screeching,
But now it's too late. 

I'm standing in this room,
And I can see the heavenly gate..
Oh no! I never prayed. 
I thought I had time to get it straight! 

An angel walked to me,
He had a book in his hand.
I knew it was the Book of Life, When would this dream end? 

I told him my name,
And he began to look.
Then he looked at me sadly and said, 
Your name is not in this book. 

Angel, this is a dream,
No, I can't be dead!
He closed the book and turned away, 
He whispered - You cannot 
proceed ahead. 

No...no this can't be real,
Angel, you can't turn me away.
Let me talk to God,
Maybe he'll let me stay.

He led me to the gate,
Jesus came to me.
He did not let me in but said,
Beloved what is your need? 

Jesus, I cried, please,
Don't cast me away from you.
Tears ran down his face as he said,
You knew what you needed to do. 

Lord, please I'm young,
I never thought I would die..
I thought I'd have plenty of time,
Death caught me by surprise. 

Lord, I went to church,
Please Jesus, I believe.
He said you would not accept me,
My love you would not receive.
Lord, there were too many
hypocrites. They weren't being true.

He took a step back and asked,
What does that have to do with you? 

Lord, my family claimed to be 
saved, They weren't real. You know.

He said, I died for you,
Now I have to go. 

I fell to my knees crying to Him,
Lord, I planned to be real tomorrow.

I couldn't make Him understand,
I had never felt such sorrow. 

Then it hit me hard, I said,
Lord, where will I go?

He looked into my eyes
and said, My child you already
know. 

Please Jesus, I begged,
The place is so hot.
It seemed to trouble and grieve him, 
He whispered, DEPART FROM ME, 
I KNOW YOU NOT. 

Lord, you're supposed to be love,
How can you send me to
damnation? 

He replied, With your mouth you said you loved me, But each day you rejected my salvation. 

With that in an instant,
Day turned into night.

I never knew such torture could be, Now too late, I know the Bible is right. 

If I can tell you anything,
Hell has no age.

It is a place of torture,
Separated from God and full of rage. 

You know, I thought it was funny,a joke, But this one thing is true. 

If you never accept Jesus Christ,
HELL IS WAITING FOR YOU! 
So please, ask Him into your heart. 

Please show this to everyone you care about.. 

((which should be everybody))

IF SOMEONE HAD A GUN HELD IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE, AND ASKED YOU IF YOU BELIEVED IN GOD, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? 

SAY NO AND FEEL ASHAMED THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?
OR SAY YES, I DO, AND DIE
STANDING UP FOR GOD?"

There are people who can walk away from you. And hear me when I tell you
this! When people can walk away from you: let them walk.

I don't want you to try to talk another person into staying with you,
loving you, calling you, caring about you, coming to see you, staying
attached to you. I mean, hang up the phone. When people can walk away
from you - let them walk. Your destiny is never tied to anybody that
left.

The Bible said, they came out from us that it might be made manifest
that
they were not for us. For had they been of us, no doubt they would have
continued with us. [1 John2:19] People leave you because they are not
joined to you. And if they are not joined to you, you can't make them
stay. Let them go! And it doesn't mean that they are bad people, it
just means that their part in the story is over. And you've got to know
when people's part in your story is over so that you don't keep trying
to
raise the dead.

You've got to know when it's dead. You've got to know when it's over.
Let me tell you something. I've got the gift of good-bye. It's the tenth
spiritual gift, I believe in good-bye. It's not that I'm hateful; it's
that I'm faithful, and I know whatever God means for me to have He'll
give it to me. And if it takes too much sweat I don't need it. Stop
begging people to stay. Let them go!!

If you are holding on to something that doesn't belong to you and was
never intended for your life, then you need to...LET IT GO!!!

If you are holding on to past hurts and pains...LET IT GO!!!

If someone can't treat you right, love you back, and see your
worth...LET IT GO!!!

If someone has angered you...LET IT GO!!!

If you are holding on to some thoughts of evil and revenge...LET IT
GO!!!

If you are involved in a wrong relationship or addiction...LET IT GO!!!

If you are holding on to a job that no longer meets your needs or
talents...LET IT GO!!!

If you have a bad attitude... LET IT GO!!!

If you keep judging others to make yourself feel better...!!! LET IT
GO!!!

If you're stuck in the past and God is trying to take you to a new Level
in Him... LET IT GO!!!

If you are struggling with the healing of a broken relationship... LET
IT GO!!!

If you keep trying to help someone who won't even try to help
themselves... LET IT GO!!!

If you're feeling depressed and stressed... LET IT GO!!!

If there is a particular situation that you are so used to handling
yourself and God is saying ""take your hands off of it,"" then you need
to... LET IT GO!!!



Let the past be the past. Forget the former things. GOD is doing a new
thing for 2005!!! LET IT GO!!!

Get Right or Get Left(behind)...think about it, and then LET IT GO!!!

""The Battle is the Lord's!""

During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are doing, and take this
opportunity. (It is literally only one minute!). All you have to do is
the following: You simply say ""The Lord's Prayer"" for the person that
sent you this message:

The Lords Prayer -

Our Father, who are in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom Come,
Thy Will be done, o n Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day,our
daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory,
forever. Amen.



Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life, for doing
What you know is pleasing to Him.

Jesus said, ""If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before

My Father."" I AM NOT ASHAMED!!!

God bless and have a powerful blessed day!!"

She Said we better do something about it or something going to give.

"event","Subject: A prayer
 
 
 Please take a moment to relax your mind and
 humble your heart to 
 focus on Christ. Allow God, to be the only person
 on your mind while 
 you read this prayer. If we can take the time to
 read long jokes, 
 stories, etc., we should give the same respect to
 this prayer. 
 Friends that pray together, stay together.

 Dear Lord, I thank You for this day. I thank You
 for my being able to 
 see and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because
 You are a forgiving 
 God and an understanding God.  You have done so
 much for me and You 
 keep on blessing me.

 Forgive me this day for everything I have done,
 said or thought that 
 was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your
 forgiveness.

 Please keep me safe from all danger and harm.
 Help me to start this 
 day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. 
 Let me make the 
 best of each and every day to clear my mind so
 that I can hear from You.

 Please broaden my mind that I can accept all
 things.

 Let me not whine and whimper over things I have
 no control over. Let 
 me continue to see sin through God's eyes and
 acknowledge it as evil. 
 And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with
 my mouth my 
 wrongdoing, and receive the forgiveness of God.

 And when this world closes in on me, let me
 remember Jesus' example 
 -to slip away and find a quiet place to pray.
 It's the best response 
 when I'm pushed beyond my limits. I know that
 when I can't pray, You 
 listen to my heart. Continue to use me to do Your
 will.

 Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to
 others.  Keep me 
 strong that I may help the weak. Keep me uplifted
 that I may have
 words of encouragement for others.  I pray for
 those that are lost 
 and can't find their way.  I pray for those that
 are misjudged and 
 misunderstood.  I pray for those who don't ! ! !
 know You intimately. 
 I pray for those that will delete this without
 sharing it with 
 others.  I pray for those that don't believe. But
 I thank you that I 
 believe.

 I believe that God changes people and God changes
 things. I pray for 
 all my sisters and brothers. For each and every
 family member in 
 their households. I pray for peace, love and joy
 in their homes that 
 they are out of debt and all their needs are met.

 I pray that every eye that reads this knows there
 is no problem, 
 circumstance, or situation greater than God.
 Every battle is in Your 
 hands for You to fight. I pray that these words
 be received into the 
 hearts of every eye that sees them and every
 mouth that confesses 
 them willingly.

 This is my prayer.
 In Jesus' Name, Amen.

 God Bless!!!!!!!!!!!

 Just repeat this phrase and see how God moves!!
 Lord I love you and I need you, come into my
 heart, please.

Don't ignore and God will bless you. 
 but because you prayed.)  
 Know that you are already blessed"

"event","A Real Friend Test!! 
 
 This is GOOD... 
 
 
 
 A simple friend has never seen you cry. A real friend has shoulders 
 
 soggy from your tears. 
 
 
 
 A simple friend doesn't know your parents' first names.. A real friend 
 
 has their phone numbers in his address book. 
 
 
 
 A simple friend brings a bottle of wine to your party.. A real friend 
 
 comes early to help you cook and stays late to help you clean. 
 
 
 
 A simple friend hates it when you call after he has gone to bed. A 
 
 real friend asks you why you took so long to call. 
 
 
 
 A simple friend seeks to talk with you about your problems. A real 
 
 friend seeks to help you with your problems. 
 
 
 A simple friend wonders about your romantic history. A real friend 
 
 could blackmail you with it. 
 
 
 
 A simple friend, when visiting, acts like a guest. A real friend opens 
 
 your refrigerator and helps himself. 
 
 
 
 A simple friend thinks the friendship is over when you HAVE an 
 
 argument. A real friend calls you after you had a fight. 
 
 
 
 A simple friend expects you to always be there for them. A real friend 
 
 expects to always be there for you! 
 
 
 
 A simple friend reads this and deletes it. A real friend passes 
 
 it on! 
 
 
 
 Pass this on to anyone you care about. It keeps us together, like our Circle of 
 
 Friends. 
 
 
 
 Today I pass the friendship ball to you. Pass it on to someone who is 
 
 a friend to you.....

"event","Hey guys whats going on. My day was blessed again and I also had fun at work. Here go some church jokes

Attending a wedding for the first time, a little girl whispered to her mother, ""Why is the bride dressed in white?"" Because white is the color of happiness, and today is the happiest day of her life."" The child thought about this for a moment, then said, ""So why is the groom wearing black?"" 

******************* 

A little girl, dressed in her Sunday best, was running as fast as she could, trying not to be late for Bible class. As she ran she prayed, ""Dear Lord, please don't let me be late! Dear Lord, please don't let me be late!"" While she was running and praying, she tripped on a curb and fell, getting her clothes dirty and tearing her dress. She got up, brushed herself off, and started running again. As she ran she once again began to pray, ""Dear Lord, please don't let me be late...But please don't shove me either!"" 

********************* 

Three boys are in the schoolyard bragging about their fathers. The first boy says, ""My Dad scribbles a few words on a piece of paper, he calls it a poem, they give him $50."" The second boy says, ""That's nothing. My Dad scribbles a few words on a piece of paper, he calls it a song, they give him $100."" The third boy says, ""I got you both beat. My Dad scribbles a few words on a piece of paper, he calls it a sermon. And it takes eight people to collect all the money!"" 

********************** 

An elderly woman died last month. Having never married, she requested no male pallbearers. In her handwritten instructions for her memorial service, she wrote, ""They wouldn't take me out while I was alive, I don't want them to take me out when I'm dead. 

******************* 

A police recruit was asked during the exam, ""What would you do if you had to arrest your own mother?"" He said, ""Call for backup."" 

********************** 

A Sunday School teacher asked her class why Joseph and Mary took Jesus with them to Jerusalem. A small child replied: ""They couldn't get a baby sitter."" 

************************ 

A Sunday school teacher was discussing the Ten Commandments with her five and six year olds. After explaining the commandment to ""honor thy father and thy mother,"" she asked ""Is there a commandment that teaches us how to treat our brothers and sisters?"" Without missing a beat one little boy answered, ""Thou shall not kill."" 

************************** 

At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's ribs. Later  the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he were ill, and said, ""Johnny, what is the matter?"" Little Johnny responded, ""I have pain in my side. I think I'm going to have a wife."" 

*********************** 

Two boys were walking home from Sunday school after hearing a strong preaching on the devil. One said to the other, ""What do you think about all this Satan stuff?"" The other boy replied, ""Well, you know how Santa Claus turned out. It's probably just your dad."""

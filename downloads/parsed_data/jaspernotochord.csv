After a solid 25 hours of planing, deplaning, and layovers, I arrived here in the Philippines at 5:10 am. Not a bad flight, save the double feature of Miss Congeniatlity 2 and...Miss Congeniality 2, but no worries, I had the company of my 30gb iPod. Durutti Column and Agitation Free got me through the hard times.

First thing I did after a warm greeting rom my Lola: hit up the local Chow King (mmmm, sarap. that's Tagalog for ""mmmm, good""). Two large bowls of Mami and two orders of beef Siomai for 120 pesos. That translates to about 2 American dollars. While there, a squad of patrolmen came in, maybe during their break, or maybe on official business, not important, but their loose fitting uniforms made them look eerily like labor or armed service workers, and the labor force here is already intimidating as they are, the softest of them look like they're carved out of mahogany. Now imagine six of these men with pistols and one with an assault rifle.

More updates later in the day! But for now, it's lunch time."

Some kids did open mic, some were forgettable and some were positively amazing.  Slam Team tore the floor up with new material, closed with an impromptu Alex West tribute group poem.  End scene.  The show was followed up with some cozy saucing, intimate conversation, and tofu in brown sauce.  Damn, I'll miss West.  She's a fine specimen of what a cool motherfucker should be.

Anyways, I'm bored as shit, but I can't go out and buy CDs (my favorite boredom remedy).  I've made a pledge to not buy any CDs during the next two months.  The Renato fortune has been making a slow but steady slide towards zero, an unfortunate result of my material habit.  I've been averaging about 2-4 CDs a week for the past two months.  This next two months (oh yea, no downloading music either) will give me time to really take in and fully appreciate all the music I have.

Titles I got over vacation:
Love - Da Capo
CAN - Future Days
Talk Talk - Spirit of Eden
The Pharcyde - Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde
Amon Duul II - Phallus Dei
Gravediggas - The Pick, the Sickle, and the Shovel
Ashra - New Age of Earth
James Brown - Sex Machine
Klaus Schulze - Irrlicht

Oh those krazy krauts.

On a lighter note, I saw Laura for the first time in a few days last night!  Most of my komrades were back at school during our break, but a bunch of Laura's were back, so I only saw her twice over break.  Missing someone can be a great feeling sometimes, especially when you know you'll see him/her soon in the future; gives you something more to look forward to.  It's a feeling I haven't felt for a while, since she and I live in the same dorm.  I guess sometimes you gotta get some alone time to really appreciate the company of people that you might take for granted.  Oof, I'm in lurv...

For the past month, I've been doubting my own conviction and ambition and overall direction in life.  Thinking I was asserting myself constructively, I chose to call off a wonderful relationship in a brief manifestation of my mother's impulsiveness and my father's pessemism and self-pity.

I went home this weekend to do some bookpacking for BKP, this organization sending used/donated books to provinces in the Philippines.  It's run by a group of Pinoys from Acton and surrounding towns.  It's headed up by Weng Jimenez (who's my buddy's momma, incidently).  I've been feeling mighty cultureless as of late, I figured this would at least be a start to getting back in touch with my roots.  It's pretty easy to forget where you come from when everyone around you is white (no beef wid da whities, dough, s'all peace) and you can't even speak your own language.  If all goes right, I'll be going back to the Philippines this summer to chill with my cousins.

Added bonus: take-as-you-please box of books that no one got around to sorting.  Got me some free Kafka and Sartre!  Sure, it's your classic college boy type shit, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for Sartre's hopelessness and Kafka's mundanely terrifying stylings.  Shit, I need to read more...hack/cough.

"event","<P>So it seems that Amon Duul II's Tanz der Lemminge is not the epic masterpiece I've heard it was. &nbsp;I got it on wax for 20 buckeroos, never actually played the thing (I don't&nbsp;gots a grandmafone)&nbsp;but I downloaded the album and sat it through.&nbsp; It's not that bad, just doesn't do much for me (at least, not 20 dollars worth).&nbsp; I'm going to get on that shit swiftly and return it, but sadly I've misplaced the receipt.&nbsp; It's been less than a week since the perchase, though, so hopefully they'll either remember me.&nbsp; There are still more titles I need, and I'm running dangerously low on cashmoneyflow, so dear readers,&nbsp;please be prayin' fo' kindness.</P>
<P>Q: whOa, is that Bruce Lee delivering a swift kick to Kareem Abdul Jabar's jaw?</P>

"event","<P>Currently, I am not quite tackling some weekend HW fun.&nbsp; I have plans to do so soon...seriously.&nbsp; Shut up.&nbsp; Fuck you.&nbsp; I tell you, if there was one fundamental truth, it wouldn't be some cosmic hooey, but that HW is a one way ticket to squarezville (read: it-is-the-weekend-and-i-am-making-flashcards-instead-of-partying-with-the-boys-and-maybe-some-reasonably-attractive-girls-ville), which is a damn shame, since the only alternative is the oblivion of academic probation.&nbsp; There are not enough hours in a day for sleep, academics, social mingling, girly time, and quality alone time.</P>

<P>Anyhow, Kraftwerk is fucking amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I picked up Autobahn not&nbsp;one week ago and&nbsp;it&nbsp;totally ruins my sheize.&nbsp;&nbsp;Computerworld (or as ze&nbsp;Deutch say, Komputarwelt)&nbsp;is new and happening&nbsp;everytime I throw that shit on,&nbsp;and I've been listening to that sucker for two years.</P>
<P>Ho hum, time to hit the books...</P>"

"event","40...the significance of this number?  This is all that is left of the Renato fortune.  In the past three days I've thrown 110 dollars at Jelly's Record Store.  Ouch.  My pussy hurts.

Anyhow, dig if you will these incredible finds:
The Chronic by Dr. Dre for 4 buckeroos
Tanz der Lemminge by Amon Duul II on wax in near mint condition for 20 (fucking right)

here's the kicker...
Phaedra by Tangerine Dream...on wax...FOR 6 DOLLARS
Quique by Seefeel...again, fOR sIX dOLLARS (hot damn)

I fucking love Seefeel.  As described in my application to Ratemyplaylist, 'Seefeel's Shoegaze/IDM/Ambient cross-pollination takes me to new worlds, man...', or something to that effect.  Sadly, there are no Seefeel albums in print, so one must traverse the globe to find any original Seefeel issue.  The other Seefeel album I have (Pure, Impure) I got at Amoeba Music in SF for the more than acceptable damage of six dollars.

Oky doky, kiddos, Daddy's tired and there is nothing else to report.  [END TRANSMISSION, BITCHES]"

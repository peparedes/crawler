The <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100405/"">Pretty Woman</a> star swept the popular Bollywood actress into his arms and kissed her several times during an AIDS-awareness event over the weekend. The action has outraged Indians, who feel Gere went too far in a country where such public displays of affection are largely taboo. Angry crowds burned effigies of Gere during demonstrations yesterday morning after photographs of him embracing and kissing Shetty appeared on the front pages of India's leading national newspapers. Gere and Shetty, who recently won the UK's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279550/"">Celebrity Big Brother</a> TV contest, joined forces in New Delhi at a press conference to highlight the HIV/AIDS epidemic among India's truck drivers. In front of a cheering crowd, Gere kissed the giggling Shetty on the hand, then kissed her on both cheeks. An embarrassed Shetty pulled back after the embrace and told Gere, ""This is a bit too much."" Speaking out about the incident this morning, the actress insists leading Hindus are making too much of a harmless mistake. She says, ""I understand this is his culture, not ours. But this was not such a big thing or so obscene for people to overreact in such manner. I understand people's sentiments, but I don't want a foreigner to take bad memories from here."" </div><div class=""studiopara""></div><div class=""studiopara"">- <a href=""http://www.imdb.com"">www.imdb.com</a></div>"

I go to the bathroom.&nbsp; I dance with Winita.&nbsp; I see Chrissy talking with a friend from Tavern.&nbsp; I put two Spice Girls songs on the jukebox.&nbsp; Winita marvels at the songs.&nbsp; I say I need to go home.&nbsp; Then I don't remember what happens next.

I awaken the next day...with no pants.&nbsp; Now, I am curious if I did something even MORE foolish than just drinking more than my limit.&nbsp; I awoke with a mild headache (nothing too severe) and a sense.&nbsp; I felt like I had a bad dream.&nbsp; A dream where I was getting sick.&nbsp; Sure enough, I go to the downstairs bathroom and there is the ""dream.""&nbsp; This was the best time to get this experience: to not even vaguely remember being sick.&nbsp; While I felt uggy walking into work on Sunday for an hour, I still feel like I did this wacky city thing.&nbsp; Do I really ever want to experience it like that again?&nbsp; Not particularly.&nbsp; But, I wouldn't mind being a little buzzed and not having to worry about driving or being stopped by a cop and walking safely back to my pad."

"event","So, two internal Monell subjects have not shown up because they didn't even get to work yet.&nbsp; In addition, a few other people came in late, took half days, or didn't even come in at all!&nbsp; Did I miss the memo that it was Slacker Friday?&nbsp; I was SUPPOSED to have wall to wall subjects from 9am-5pm.&nbsp; Hopefully at least my outside subjects come in.&nbsp; I even have a new participant I have to break in today; those sessions are always a bit nerve-racking as I want them to do well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

On a side note, I watched Babel last night and let me just say it is the best movie of the year (well, best movie of the year that was nominated...The Prestige and The Fountain get that honor, but didn't get a look at the main prize).&nbsp; In addition, I can't believe that both Adriana Barazza and Rinko Kikuchi will lose to Jennifer Hudson this weekend (no offense to Ms Hudson, but the Babel twosome were simply a marvel, especially Barazza, although it is quite hard to choose between the two of them!).&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful as always Cate Blanchett had shining moments in what amounted to one of the smallest roles of her career.&nbsp; Even Brad Pitt's game was raised and I can honestly say he gave a very good performance."

"event","<p>Sleep was not had in Sean-land last night.&nbsp; I got home from running an orientation class at Kohl's at around 11pm.&nbsp; I settled myself down to watch Veronica Mars before bed (that show needs all the help it can get...watch it and tell a friend).&nbsp; After the show, I went downstairs and proceeded to slowly get to sleep.&nbsp; Just as REM was upon me, Max and Jane (they will need names, so I shall provide them with ones) begin an argument at my front steps.&nbsp; For those who don't know, I live in the FRONT apartment of the building, so I am right near the main entrance door, which is also right near my windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Both were drunk in varying degrees.&nbsp; Jane was more intoxicated.&nbsp; From what I could gather from the expletive laced conversation, Jane had wanted to go out (Jane, I THINK, is the one who lives in my building.&nbsp; Up until today, I had only met one other girl, Selma {real name} on the day I moved in) with Max.&nbsp; They went to a bar where Max proceeded to spend $130 on the evening.&nbsp; However, Jane was busy talking with lots of other people, including other males.&nbsp; She basically ignored Max while she was drinking the beverages he paid for her.&nbsp; Max had class the next morning so he wanted to leave early.&nbsp; Jane agreed but ended up, exact words here, ""standing on the street corner doing nothing for 20 minutes.""&nbsp; Then they arrive at my doorstep.&nbsp; Jane is upset that Max never respects her (she DID accept his drinks though and if you didn't want to have this argument, you should have at least talked with him or offered him a BJ in the bathroom).&nbsp; Max wants to know why he should stick around if he would treat her well if she is going to ignore him.&nbsp; Max wants to table all discussion because, heck, it is 2:00.&nbsp; Jane says she doesn't want to be around him.&nbsp; He said, ""Let's either go to sleep now and continue this tomorrow, as we both have to be up, or let me just pick my stuff up from your place and leave.""&nbsp; She wants to do neither.&nbsp; Apparently, she doesn't want him in her place long enough to sleep OR quick enough to simply remove his back pack.&nbsp; He somehow gets the keys from her drunken self and goes stomping into my building (at least I heard stomping...it felt like stomping).&nbsp; Jane proceeds to do something (cry, puke, touch herself) that prompts a car of rather cute looking males to stop and ask if she is alright.&nbsp; She says she is just having a spat with a boyfriend and that he is a jerk.</p><p>Max eventually comes out.&nbsp; Jane says people were concerned for her.&nbsp; Being drunk, she starts to be apologetic apparently.&nbsp; Max says they should talk about this inside.&nbsp; But, again, Jane doesn't WANT to be near him, making Max scream, ""Make a decision....F(&amp;*^)&amp;&amp;!""&nbsp; at the top of his lungs.&nbsp; (Can I add that I am absolutely riveted by my window spying on this discussion?&nbsp; My mother, upon hearing about this ordeal, says, ""I have taught you well!"").&nbsp; Eventually, Jane recapitulates and I think starts to kiss him.&nbsp; They then stomp inside (again, I hear stomps) and they slam the door.</p><p>I want to side with Max, the guy who isn't my fellow house mate.&nbsp; He seemed to want to NOT be yelling outside and try to make things better for everyone by either sleeping or removing himself from the situation.&nbsp; Jane simply wouldn't allow that.</p><p>I don't like Max or Jane.&nbsp; They made me sleep through my RIDICULOUSLY loud alarm (I am a heavy sleeper) for two hours and made me miss my 9am appointment for my own experiment and participating in a paid one for someone else at 10am.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

- I do not like how the kitchen sink leaks into a basin.&nbsp; I should probably call a landlord about that or something.
- I do not like the loud fire alarm going off multiple times, once straight for twenty minutes.
- I love the little deli a block away from me which sells Rolling Rock 6 packs for 7 bucks!
- I love the abundance of food I can order around me; on the other side I do not like the fact that I haven't had the initiative to actually buy food.
- I love the massive amounts of space I have on both floors.
- I love my new Malm bed.&nbsp; Go ahead, say it.&nbsp; Malm.
- I love the whole hour shaved off my morning ritual which is now spent sleeping.
- I don't like that Verizon is ""unsure"" if I will be able to have a phone line (huh???) and that they can't give me DSL until February 23, but I will be paying for it until then.

Cheese is among the products listed as junk food by the Food Standards Agency, which has cited its high fat content -- some 900 calories from fat in a typical serving, according to the agency. But the British Cheese Board and the National Farmers' Union have expressed outrage over the ruling. The Cheese Board said that a typical portion of cheese contains 270-360 calories and is actually one of the most ""nutritionally complete"" foods. Interviewed by the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/company/co0058146/"">BBC</a>, Mary Quicke, a Devon cheesemaker, summed up her reaction to the regulation: ""Frankly, it's bonkers,"" she said.&nbsp;<br /><br />- <a href=""http://www.imdb.com"">www.imdb.com</a></div>"

Bass and Boyfriend Attempt To Rekindle Romance


 Former 'N Sync star Lance Bass and reality TV star Reichen Lehmkuhl are on the verge of getting back together after working through their recent relationship troubles. Bass, who announced he was gay and dating Lehmkuhl earlier this year, posted a message on his MySpace Web page addressing rumors surrounding their recent split. His representative, Cindy Owen, confirmed the couple had separated on Monday, but Bass insists they are giving their relationship a second chance. He says, ""Reichen and I have gone through a few rough days... I have no doubt things will work out. We are very mature and deal with things the right way."" Responding to rumors that the couple had an ""open"" relationship, Bass writes, ""What the hell does that mean anyway?""

It is another odd bass heavy march song, yet it samples an odd source: The Lonely Goatheard song from the Sound of Music.  Yes, you heard that right.  I have to admit that I have no idea what to think of this song.  It is possibly the weirdest sounding song I have ever heard.  It sounds like a song that is ramping up to the chorus, but never gets there.  It is just...weird.  Thoughts??"

Bass Breaks Up With Boyfriend


 Former 'N Sync star Lance Bass and his boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl have split after a series of rows. Bass, who announced he was gay and involved with the model-turned-reality TV star this summer, faces a lonely Christmas after his representative, Cindy Owen, confirmed the split. She says, ""They have broken up."" Sources close to the couple tell celebrity blogger Perez Hilton the split happened very recently and that it was a mutual decision. One says, ""They had been fighting a lot lately. They tried a lot of things to make it work - even opening up the relationship - but they would just fight all the time towards the end. It wasn't working.""

With the heat wave that is today, the lab is at sauna proportions.  It had been bad previously this week, but yesterday there was a reprieve and some form of air was pumped in.  Today?  There is absolutely no air.  NONE.  And with no windows on our side of the floor, we don't even have the option to ventilate.  My antipersperant is doing all it can, poor thing.  Can't someone create some switch to just turn the heat OFF???"

"event","So yeah I know I haven't updated in more than a month, but keep in mind, September is also Fall Premiere month on TV.  Yeah, my life is that exciting that I apparently HAVE to watch about 20+ hours of primetime TV and backlogged programs.  I like to at least think I am saving money on buying future TV on DVDs.

Anywho, I needed to update my journal to share what just happened.  After coming from my boss' office, I saw two colleagues roaming the halls, with an odd look to them.  My one co-worker Jen found our other co-worker Laura and asked her, ""Um...Laura...do you have a runaway rat?""  Apparently Laura (aka Food in Halls) was missing a rat, as it had scampered into the lab next to mine.  Laura, sheepish, proclaimed, ""That is what I get for letting it be a free lab rat.""

Yup, gotta love science."

"event","journal entry from monday,

""im feeling crazy. i was sitting in the library attempting to read trainspotting when i looked around me..
and saw this odd mass hysterical,self centered kind of organiization.
people scavaging through books and doing things so strangly.
it scared me. i try to keep reasing but i couldnt.
i ran out. i was and am disturbed .but not in a bad way
im looking around and there are cars and a siren and nothing feels real.its all so intricate
and so fabricated,too fuckin fabricated..
all these people pretending to live,me pretending to live.people pretending they dont know im staring at them.
its all so wierd.and i dont know if im content with this quant little quilt of humanity.
im outside now.and it feels like ive never been alone before this moment
likw i never knew distance till now.
distance sounds like industrialization.a silly,annoying little humm. and horns going.
it looks like people running around in blind hysterics pretending they have a point.
its too obvious to ignore ad to vast to sepreate from.my brain is going much faster than my pen ever will.
and im glad to be alone today to think and write.
to be beautiful and not have to have someone tell me that i am.
im glad i didnt go to school,becuase now im learning
maybe siting here alone and trying to make up for my loss of words sets me apart.maybe it makes me apart.
i dont know,im rambling,but i feel so clear.
and if no one gets it,thats just it,they dont get it.and they dont have to.
the sun is making my hair hot but they shade is cooling my boots.im so amazed...and perplexed;really confused..
but this means everything

right now."

"event","<font face=arial>at the end of the line
is the sound of your voice
and the words i shall enver say
the words people fear when they do not make them laugh
that have too often been in books songs and movies
words id like to tell you
and words id like to live
words i shall never say
i want to
i just cant
im so lonesome i could die
and i know where you are
ill know you,youll know me
spare me some time
ill give you all mine
id liek to come to you
but i stay
hating myself
ill never come to you
i want to i just cant
i want to speak to you
i want to be with you
or at least try to sleep
im afraid youll be deaf
im afraid youll excape
afraid im too foward
i cannnot tell you
that i love you,perhaps.
but if you think you could love me tommorow
dont be afraid of memories or sorrow
we'll flee the past for we can live tommorow
come and rescue me
if you could love me tommorow
dont be afraid if the path looks narrow
come and rescue me
if your fed up with your life and find no way
when everyday is just another yesterday
think of me
think of me
but if you...."

"event","<font face=arial>this journal...will have alot of words.
alittle plagerism...
lots of words..

(personal diary entry from today):
i hate...just hate more than i thought i would,and more than i want to. i want to be peaceful. i know im the one who created all this chaos for myself.this sort of wierd; unatural kind of chaos.i let all these things touch and be near me and now they want to live with and be inside of me;between my insanity and thier silly self involvement...it..it just doesnt work out.i dont want these elements apart of my life. i dont like thier envolvment,and dont know why they insist so much.i dont trust them basically.i dont want them around,but i dont know who and what to filter out.i have to learn to live without anything but myself.risks are not my thing. i get adicted to them and dont know where to stop.

i dont know why i write anymore.maybe i like the invasion.its not for honesty,sure as fuck isnt for redemption,or sanity,self peace or even the lowest form of self pity.i think i do it out of habit;ive learn those hurt you.maybe the realization that opening up doesnt help or make people forget.that ill never be able to change my life,just write about it.to help me see some things are unforgivable and some things deserve punishment."

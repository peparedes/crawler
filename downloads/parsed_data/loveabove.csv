[yes i have olive gardens phone number in my cellular]
then after the biggest after school snack ever. i went home and fell straight asleep on my couch.. yeah i slept for like 2 n half hours.. i feel like nick.. cuz he woudnl't work out with me today cuz he wanted to nap. and i went home and did the same thing.. ha yeah ima loser. then when i woke up from my nap. i went to the midpark girls basketball game. it was pretty sweet. at games like those it makes me wanna play again. next year i mite just try out and be like on BG's practice squad for basketball just cuz i love organized basketball. i bet that i suck tho.. i mean i never could shoot but idk i prolly got slow. blah.

"event","honestly lately i've been super stressed because of high school. i mean i failed comp for the quarte cuz papa woulnd't accept my research paper.. yeah not happy but then i got a D in APES cuz i copied off of mike n jim. we aren't too smart but whatever.. school sucks and im soo happy this week was over because it was stress times 10 for this lil asian. but this weekend was pretty tight other then the fact i've had to wake up early saturday and sunday for work. that really sucks i barely got n e sleeep at all so since its sunday i'm gonna sleep til i have to go to hollister for our staff meeting. oh yeah i got my job back at hollister, cuz i go there and my old boss, Mark, he was like my favorite person there, he was like u have a paycheck still here from when u worked. i was shocked but definatly excited since it was a 77$ paycheck. i was like H yes. Then mark asked me to come back and work for him and that i could just fill out an application and just come to orientation which was this morning. and i got payed to go to orientation so thats sweet. hollister is becomin a lot more organized under mark's eye since the other managers left.. [thank goodness]. but yeah. sooo
Friday: i had dance camp early in the mornin YIKES and i was soo dead. the lil kids were adorable tho. haha soo cute. then i went to the mall with sarah to get my sisters stuff from hollister and i got my job back. then sarah, lee and i went to the game. then hung out at my house afterwards with fox. saturday: i woke up early to work. i had to go ref the lil girls. then i left to go with mindy and john [her friend] to go get chipotle and then go get our hair done. we met my brother and some girl up there. i hope this girl wasn't tryin to date my brother. since she didn't say one word to me. haha. n e ways.. i got my hair dyed more red but u can't see it really. it looks more tinted red but i wanted something more durastic. but whatever its kewl. i just can't wait til summer so i can highlight it lighter. then i go home and go out to panera with jayne, katelyn and schmid it was pretty kewl i like food.. u no..then came home cleaned, and went to pick up the SIBS for and US nite. 
now i gotta take fox home. shes been here like every nite this weekend, but right now i can't take her home cuz she insists on watchin bambi.. shes a weirdo. and if u guys saw that constipated away messege she put up on my screen name. IT WAS HER.. shes a freak..
UPDATE::: WHO WANTS TWO TURTLES?!?!?! they are stinkin up my room tooo much! they need a better home. 

leave me a cool messege :D

but as for my friend don, i feel he gets bashed a ton, even by me, just cuz we know eachothers flaws and we know what we dislike about eachother. i love how people that dont know him can just put him out there like nothing. IF u guyz honestly knew bout DON and what he does for people u'd really like him. HE knows he's arrogant, and im proud of him being able to say that but honestly..u guyz dont even know how hard that is to say for him. but its like.. pick on someone else not him. i mean he talks about his faith, but i mean other ppl who have totally different religions or feelings talk about it too. whats the difference.."

"event","ceramics is prolly one of the easiest classes to slack in, so of course i slack even more then expected. but yet i go there and sit there, dont do much, dont make much, just talk to the kewl kids around me.. p.s. they are all pretty sweet. one in particular is one of the sweetest ever..
the cool group in ceramics haha which i think is the cool group, sits outside the actual ceramics room, u no.. to talk about the teacher. ha j/k. n e ways.. we have the usual bunch me, bill and dave then marylynn made her way out there to come hang, and last but not least.. nicole made her way out there, to make the table complete. she never really talked much, but she seemed quiet and kept to herself. all i knew was she had beautiful blue eyes and really cool dark hair.. little did i know she would be readin my crazy journals entries.
so one day over break, i of course have one of these weird journals, talking about change, and what it has been doin in my life, with my friends, family n wut not. i of course have been very emotionally upset around that time too. but do i keep my head down? no no no, because the next day i pop in to see i have 2 comments, from one lovely girl who actually took time to read my journal, and better yet leave a comment showin her feelings and gratitude! i dont even get that from my closesets friends. im sure u all can guess what blue eyed beauty this was..
what i've realized is that Nicole, mite not be the person i go and spill my heart out to, but thats ok, we aren't that close, but to just know that someone cares, someone that u dont know too well. thats a great feeling and i applaud her each chance i can to let ppl no that you have a lot of effect on people, nice gestuers go a long way.
Nicole i believe has had it a lil rough down the road. i mean shes got a cool family im sure, maybe some problems here and there, but who doesnt? Nicole takes care of her brothers and sisters all the time. she is like a mom. i applaud her because i definatly dont know what that is like, being the only child, and seein her just amazes me. she also is heavily in love with a young boy named Greg, sometimes u can't help but laugh because shes soo cute about him, and then i remember what its like to be in love and you can't do much but smile. this girl always amazes me and even though we aren't super close, the respect i have for her is well deserved. what a beautiful person."

Spending all my money on phone cards
Waiting for my ship to come in
In from that ocean
Come home to this sea
Harboring in me
I don't believe in four leaf clovers
Or the luck they're suppose to bring
I've used all my wild cards
But theres something I can do
To get close to you

Chorus:
I've got dreams of love
And I love you 
I know you feel the same way too
I feel your spirt
and when your away
Somehow somewhere
I'll see you again
But intill then
I've got dreams of loveing you

Thinking bout' every little thing
We ever did crazy
Sipping on that memory lane
That may never closed it
Seven days of the week
I can drive in my sleep
 
Dreams I will share 
When I see you again
And I'll see you again pretty soon
I could wait 
But in till then..."

"event","so the last couple weeks have been soo emotional for me. i can't even believe how things change, how people change, how they said one thing and now are for another thing. i've found myself being changed also.
I love the people i hang out with and i love all my friends but i just need to go to college. i need to meet new people i need to stop being with the ppl that remind me of certain things, certain places in my life. i need a find someone new to love to get over my last one if i can. i need a lot of things right now but i just have to be patience. love is patient, something i have to work on.
i still hang on to someone i dont know. i dont know if the person i fell in love with still exisits..all i no is that there is love there that i wish wasn't. then i could get over all my hurt and all my pain and he could go on with out me.. happy and then i could be happy. life would be swell..i guess GOd is teaching me a huge lesson here. it just sucks beyond n e thing. i can't even cry because it sucks soo bad. Even though im a christian no where does it say you'll always be happy. I mean you'll have your joy from the holy spirit n wut not. but things still happen in your life. and obviously they happen for a reason. i just need sit back and let whatever happen happen, even tho it will prolly tear me apart i must be strong.
i think im gonna be tramatized by love the rest of my life..  im scared of boys.. they hurt u.
Today i went to my box, i have a box dedciated to my 2 year relationship. i had a notebook, that clearly was just full of entrys bout him.. yup threw that away... those things just remind me and sometimes its not the best. 
other then my wonderful weeks um.. its snowin relaly hard today and i hope we dont have school tomorrow. cuz i dislike school like woah. and umm.. i realllllllllly wanna go to 707 so i think im gonna drive out there. which mite be a lil crazy but honestly i dont care. i need some praise and worship time.
Last nite erin, schmid and jayne slept over it was mighty fun. we went over rays for awhile which was good then weird. i hung out with all the peeps it was mighty mighty fun. im glad jayne and schmid went over there even tho they prolly felt weird but i dont think they felt too weird.
wellllllllll im off to go read or something but i don twanna do my research paper so im not gonna. but leave me something inspirational... :D

He said "" no on will love you more than me, you wont find anyone better"" she sat and cried, she knew she hurt him. She believed his words, they were soothing, they made her feel exactly how she wanted to feel... loved..he filled a void of pain. a void that can no longer be filled by him. 
she was dumb enough to believe his words..but now the words that were once soothing, hurt, because knowing that people change, and not always for the best. She was stupid enough to believe him. he will never understand the hurt he has always put on her..."

After that i went home and started to get ready for my dad's b-day party. There were tons of ppl there. There was tons of food too. It was awesome. Then Eliane and my sister came in and did my hair for the 80's party which was amazing. i had the great wall of china on my head it was HILIARIOUS. i had the worse make up on too. Then after that i was like ah idk if i should leave but a lot of ppl were leaving to go bowling so i hopped on that bandwagon cuz i was like uhhh there was tons of ppl there i didn't know and i was hott and sweaty and nasty from dancing haha. now my legs hurt! 
Bowling was fun, it was just a nice hang out. Then after bowling Rob and Pete came over, we shared a lot of lovely stories, then played some trivia pursuit. It was actually a very very fun time. I miss those guyz. see there are some people i miss that left and then there are some im just like idk.. its better u leave..
Today i was in a pretty good mood after talking to opie cuz he just made me feel better. then tonite was good but i just got upset cuz people have changed and im still in love with a guy that doesn't excist. My mom always told me too, u can't change people. :sad:

I sat there my self for a long time cuz i have no cousins under the age of 25 and no one there was uner the age of 50. So i just sat and watched football. I drove there and then drove myself home cuz i was bored there. came home to an empty house and sat around more. Til finally sarah, lee and erin came over. watched ""mean girls"" with donnie and my sister and my girls. and now erin is over gettin 80s music. fun fun fun. Lets just say that holidays just make me feel very lonely. and i dislike winter it makes me sad. i have yet to have a good christmas i can remember. im tryin to make this one a good one.

"event","My day was very lovely and boring but also very nice at the same time.
I started my day by wakein up about around noon. My brother called me that is the only reason y i woke up. But i'm still very tired. I woke up and watched one of the best movies in the world "" A WALK TO REMEMBER "". Which sparked the new idea of the new icon. :D The movie reminds me of a good time in my life, cuz that is when i used to watch it a lot, which was the summer going into my sophomore year which was one of the best times of my life. It means a lot to me ;D ;D...
After watchin the movie, i ate a couple bagels then sat around even more procrastinatin my turtle cleaning job, which when i picked schmid up i ended up doing which sucked. I thought i threw my back out for a minute, but i was good. Turtles are soo boring yet soo cool, and very very very dirty. yucky! ha. Schmid and i sat round watched ELF then ran to get some yummy food from penn station [when i'm with her and jayne all i do is eat] 
Later one Fox came over, we started downloading 80's songs which are amazing, she was dancing of excitment for her crazy 80's party on friday which is gonna be amaZing, so if ur not there, ur not kewl haha. I can't wait. U GOTTA DRESS 80's... :D Continuing this crazy 80's music we thought of bringin in the 13 going on 30, WE HAVE A SURPRISE.. YES, LEE N FOX :D
We had some nice visitors today. Beautiful Bridget came over with some crazy kid who plays the drums in this band.. yes Jessie Wither,i can't belive he was in my room! haha. Janie B came over too, how i missed that sexy thang, fox and i are gonna go down and visit that lovely lady. After this chill nite of excitement. It only left me, fox and lee here just dancing, until our PARTY stopped by the unexpected LIGHTS, which had gone out. NO power here for like an hour or soo. It was fun tho, Fox played my guitar and we all sang, well me and leora haha. Then after those fine ladies left, i enjoyed myself to a sensational bubble bath, with candles and i even took my portable DVD player in there to enjoy the lovliness of watching a walk to remember again [the reason y i've watched it soo much today is cuz i just found it recently].That is the most fun i've ever had in the dark. I was soo excited for my bath it was amaZing!!!! extra emphasis on the ""Z"". So now im downloading songs for fox then hittin the sack cuz my aunt cookie is coming here tomorrow from DC. How Coool! i like her. 
SO i'm out now, leave me something if u wanna :D. i'd like it.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING :D

<P><FONT size=2>First off Erin and i get into an accident on the way down to OU.. she was wiggin at first i felt bad. I was drivin but i wasn't really freakin i just felt bad for fox cuz she was upset bout the car. We definatly could not drive that thang.. the tire was messed up like woah. P.S. the guy who hit us was drinkin.. for all ya drinkers, think twice bout drivin.. for serious.good things i was drivin tho cuz fox didn't have her licence on her and i did. But tim, rob and dave came and picked us up after waitin 2 hours in columbus at this weird office at the tow truck place.. the people there were hicks and had no teeth it was silly. it was really good to see those guys tho. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I hung out with tim pretty much the whole time. it reminded me of old times which was good and bad. i dont need that. moving on sounds really good to me. i think that i could find someone better fit for me.this weekend really helped me to realize that and just help me become stronger. ""for when i am weak, i am strong"". man i love JC. sometimes i just feel unworthy tho cuz of everything He did for us and everything we do wrong against Him. but he is merciful. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Today 707 was amazing we started the boy meets girl series. I'm really excited its going majorly in depth on havin a chrstian relationship and a healthy one at that. It really helped me put things from my past relationship in perspective. I'm really glad that God is lookin out for me everywhere i go. pray for me.. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;Dance team is gonna be really fun and honestly i like to dance a lot, its has always been something i've wanted to do, but of course i've been consumed with basketball and soccer. not playin basketaball is something i've decided on, because i've been consumed with it way too much. not a lot of people fully understand and i dont have to tell the world why i exactly quit. It just playing it soo much burns u out. amongst other things. also a plus is more time for God. which definatly is a big focus in my life. </P>

<P>Matthew is one amazing book in the bible. It hits a lot of major points of moral. it also has the sermon on the mount which is one of my favorite things to read. That is loacted in Matthew 5. In Matthew Five verses 43-48 it speaks of loving your enemy. That is one mighty hard task to do as a human. Our first reaction is to just hate the people who hate us. But what kind of a person are we , if we hate those who hate us? But to love those who hate us, that is a true task of difference. How different are we if we hate those who hate us. When in the bible God knows and feels we must be different from our destructive world. God told us to hate the worldy things because those things are not eternal.He is eternal. An in the verse its states ""If you are kind to only your friends, how are you different from anyone else?"" Are you different? I try to be different.. but of course im not perfect..oh JC is :D ;D. make a difference be different.. haha</P>
<P>Ha, im not gonna lie im gettin pretty used to nasty comments and bitterness. but it definatly teaches&nbsp;u in the end.</P>

<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>When i got there we started learnin this hard dance and i coudln't see because of the massive amounts of ppl in the room. so me catchin on was real hard. so to top it off nate, kris and i had to go first.. lovely since we didn't even know it. but whatever so we actually got picked witht the big group surprisenly. but the judges were doin some crazy way of dividing us soo to find out who is actually on the team shall be exciting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>to top off my wrongly goin day..i come home and i didn't do n e homework. so im not going to school tomrorow. i decided ha! but n e ways ppl came over for d-ship and pow wow. it was really good because we focused on the praise and worship and just prayed a lot a lot which was real good. but ari calls me durin it but i call her back to find out that i have to go to their practice tomorrow soo pretty much they can tell me how they feel. and make me feel bad for not playin. its just like gees bring on more and more drama i thought they understood but coach is makin them feel otherwise so im just like whatever. i've made a decision. it has nothing to do with the girls, i love them and im happy that i've got to experience those years with them but now is enough i dont like basketball and espcially basketball season. please forgive me for takin my last year off to let me do what i really wanna do. and im sorry to everyone that i tryed out for dance team. that seemed like something fun.. shoot me please. me=stressed.. so dont mind me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>Not gonna lie that kinda hurt my feelins, when i first thought about this i was like well thats stupid...who would actually take time out of their day to come critisize my journal, or journals at that. I first thought fine then thats kewl i dont want them readin my journals. but then after awhile i thought about it and God worked in my heart, he definatly showed me that maybe that person should be reading my journals. Cuz i mean they are all about God. Maybe they could actualy get something out of them. I respect that persons views tho, i mean i know im a christian, thats what my life is all about, but its only situations like this where it will make you stronger, cuz i mean u just gotta have love and respect for the people who do wrong against you. I've really been tryin to concetrate on that. Loving others is such a powerful thing, it overcomes all darkness. So to whomever wrote that, Thanks for helping me realize that. [this is me bein serious not mean or n e thing]</FONT></P>

I think she really really liked it. which was like SOO happy for her to come.I pray that one day she could feel connected thru christianity because i know that she would definatly get a kick outta it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>soo i was having a great day til some minor opposition...but u know what.. u can't let n e one have that much control over your feelings, it'll just hurt you in the end. but today at service dan gave this amazing sermon and he talked about how he dated this girl in high school and how he felt she was his ""cure"" for having resentful parents and how he consumed himself with her and then knew in the end that the Lord didn't want him to be with her. and the sermon was about how the Lord knows whats going to happen and how us as humans live in the now, because dan knew he had to give up his girlfriend because the Lord had a bigger plan for him and his wife and now two children. kinda makes me think A lot! i still hate myself for bein so vunerable to opposition...i dont know if i can hold on much longer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>Today tho i went to church with Don, it was interesting because im not used to going to a pentacostal church and i was like ahh kinda at first but all i gots to say is HALLEIUJAH [ i think thats how u spell it] because those people gotta lot of heart for JC and love to show it soo thats sweet. I got&nbsp;to meet Don's mother and very very cute niece which was fun. after that we went to golden coral which was real yummy. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>After church i came home and cleaned a lil bit then i hung out with my fam cuz they came over for dinner. then i was off to 707 which by the way if i didn't tell you was amazing. I &lt;3 JC</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>the devil believed in God! n e one can believe, but the steps of living it. Perfection is one word used harshly against christians. if u find me a christian that is perfect i'd convert to something else. we as humans have issues. sin is something in our heart, we like it, we think it, it is a part of us. As humans we fall short of the glory of God. God <U>cannont</U> be with sin. Also this is for the people who claim to be christians but find themselves saying that&nbsp;a sin&nbsp;{ex: smoking, drugs, sex, drinking, cheatin on spouce,] is </FONT><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>OK, false.. it is one thing to have a severe problem and addition to them, but its another thing to let it slide because you feel its alright. you telling urself a sin is right is just trying to justify what ur doing against God. This entry might cause controversey but the people who are chritsians need to know and i just want them to know&nbsp;so they can grow with God, cuz if you are a christian, that should be the number one thing in ur life and God loves you soo much. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>Stephanie lange and i have a lot of conversations about God and faith jsut because i like talkin to her about it because shes a very open and spiritual person. one day we had a conversation about how at times she feels people hide behind their faith. i sat there and i was like WOW, i think that people do that to. Then we started talkin about halfway christians, or ""lukewarm"" christians who believe but yet still haven't move in their faith or grown.&nbsp; it just makes me realize that i know people aren't perefect and i accept that because im definatly NOT perfect, but i just want people to grow in their faith especially if they understand the WORD, the knowledge, not a lot of people have that opportunity or embrace it.&nbsp; and i dont want this&nbsp; entry to be like OH CORBIE HATES ALL NON CHRISTIANS or blah blah. because that is sooo not the truth. i love soo many people and i love my friends who aren't even christians, if there is n et hing in this entry i want people to know is that i love you and i care about you, and i wish that u could just find something in this entry to make you think of what u believe, or how u feel about doing things.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>i as a christian struggle a lot too, some people feel that if u accept God in ur life hes gonna make everything perfect, that is false also. God cannot make ur life perfect because the sinnful and wordly nature of our society makes it hard for us to have a fully ""perfect"" life, also and most importantly the sin in our heart is the cause of that. As my testimony i became a christian the summer going into my sohpomore year, after i accepted God my life was definatly not perfect, i mean i was happy and what not but i still had a lot of issues with myself and things in my life. Then as a lot of ppl know i started a realtionship with still the love of my life, timothy. i was soo consumed with him for 2 years and it was im not gonna lie, horrible for me, i mean at times i felt like i was temporarily happy but i just wasn't what i was supposed to be. i felt at that time i was livin a life of a lukewarm christian. We broke up this passed summer, i started growing more and more and definatly a lot more when he left, because even the sight of him was just sadness. It has been 3 months and i've grown soo much in my faith, and it was truely a wonderful thing. Ha but im still not perfect. far from it. this entry is just to spark things in ur heart. not to be offended cuz i definatly dont wanna start drama, but u figure that this is my journal i can write my feelins? i hope no one is offended ;[.. these thoughts have been on my mind for awhile now and i just needed to vent since this basketball situation. but its not like n e one reads my journal ne ways..ha </FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>This passed weekend i had some major drama with my soccer team. i mean i know i did some things that was prolly hurtful but it was never ever meanin to be mean. Gosh im not that bad of a person tha tpeople think i am. it really upsets me to see the girls on my team think i hate them just because i dont like go out of my way to go and talk to each and every one of them. its hard . i've made a lot of younger friends on varsity and its kinda of convient because they are ON varsity. but that leaves me to tend to not talk to much of the j/v girls who think i hate them. people dont understand my sarcasticness they just think im mean and to be quite honest im sick of it. i mean u guys can talk to me too. ima normal human being geess.. but back to the drama, some hurtful things were said about me and my faith. and to those who really know me faith is super important to me. i mean i know that some of the things she didn't really mean but i know that someof them she did which reallllly breaks my heart. to start off I KNOW im not perfect and i want </FONT><FONT color=#9999ff size=2>everyone to know that. i mean im human gosh i know that ima sinner. but to be honest i do not think ima&nbsp; horrible person. i mean i mite do somethings that are wrong but everyone makes mistakes. but i dont think a lot of people can truely say they are a bad person because i know deep down everyone has a good heart and they just need some lovin. [JC hAHA] but me being a christian im tryin to fix the things about myself that i need to, thru God, someone once told me that we do whats possible and let God do the impossible. being a christian is not accepting the way you are, but tryin to change ur self to be the person that God wants u to be. but i mean if u guyz want to say stuff about me please just say it about me not about my faith cuz my faith is reallllllllly important to me and its just very very hurtful to see people dissin me like that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#6666cc size=2>Today i woke up early to run a mile with carrie streatar because i did not do one of my quiet times. and that is my punishment. i hate running but it was a nice start to the day. Apes was boring school sucked cuz i was soo tired but i mean its all good. practice sucked but its ok i got through it even tho my back is killin me now because all we did was run and it hurts but oh well. i'm in a really good mood now, i believe its because of d-ship and just being with my girls. I hope that i can find a good thing like this at college, so i can have a good fellowship.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc66cc size=2><STRONG>Today was a good day. I got to sleep in for awhile cuz i had a long nite last nite. I missed freshman mentoring but oh well its boring n e ways. but the day went by really fast, i had a study hall in the middle of my two classes so i got me and lee some pizza for lunch {big pimpin]. last week we got olive garden. aren't u jealous. i know u r. but ne&nbsp; ways. after skewl i waited in line to go see the trainer.. how redciulous. i know but we have to wait after the football players. of course of course. but i do love all the football guyz. goodluck on friday.. moving on i hurt my back yesterday which caused some back pain in the lower back. i did not practice today because of it, i got to rest , and maybe tomorrow i will go light. After practice i raced home to eat and then go to youth group with the coolest girl in the world.[ erin fox] younthgroup was really fun. it is different from younglife, but i belive this will be a better different. I'm glad that erin, steph and i have gotten really involved with our church. i really like it there and hope to make some good friends. Its nice to see how God works in peoples lives. Afterwards erin and i had a nice long chat, cuz thats how we do. what would i do without her. her and i talkin made me realize a lot of things and what i need to fix, so im excited to let God do that.&nbsp; ALso i've realized some things that God wants me to do in my life so im glad that i can be apart of his great plan.&nbsp; i think its time to move on, because this a new chapter in my life and im ready to live it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just got done praying and it was very soothing. prayin for everyone has been on my mind lately.. maybe i was prayin for&nbsp; U ;D u never know. but i have to go now. i have to take notes. soo every one&nbsp; have a wonderful nite. :D</STRONG></FONT></P>

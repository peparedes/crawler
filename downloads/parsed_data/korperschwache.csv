3xC60 Edition of 100

Black Canyon Drone starts things off right away with a blast of hyper
distorted guitar and doesn't stop for the remainder if the cassette.
Hidden melodies float in and out, with the occasional riff and drum
beat surfacing. Death Disco slows things down with stumbling drums
over layers of murk and blackened filth. Dissonance and Submission
finishes everything off with walls of buzz and shards of feedback. Not
for the open-minded.</i>

(In fact, I have two heavy-ass boxes full of back issues spanning about fifteen years, and I still refer to them from time to time... although I really wish I had it all on CD-ROM so I could access the information a lot faster and toss the magazines in the recycle bin before the next move.) The magazine's quality level started to drop in the early 90s, though, and with the exception of one year about a decade ago when I subscribed again to see if the magazine had improved (it hadn't; in fact, it had gotten even worse), I haven't read it in ages. <i>Boo hoo, I am a sad cheese now....</i>

"event","Last night I dreamed I was at the airport with my son (of course, in real life I have no children, natch), who was about eight years old and dressed like a li'l cowboy, with jeans and a checked shirt and a li'l red bandana around his neck. We were waiting for a flight to arrive and standing around at the gate, looking out the window, waiting for the plane... waiting, waiting, waiting. While we were waiting, an old man came over and gave him a deck of cards and walked off. When he opened the deck of cards, he found the individual cards, on the playing side, festooned with pictures of people who had committed suicide.

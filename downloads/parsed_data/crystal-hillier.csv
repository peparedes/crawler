"event","yeahhh how depressing was that movie. Kinda makes you realise how short life is and to make sure you have no regrets. The funny thing is Vivian prized her lifestyle, being so caught up in it, she never realised how much she was giving away in favour of it until the very bitter end. This is like one of those moral stories we read as a kid, like the turtle and the hare kind of thing, life's too short to not have those kind of meaningful relationships with eachother, the kind where a group of mates go watch da footy and down a couple of schooners at da local pub (LOL dats da great aussie lifestyle for ya 'VIC- VICTORIA BITTER'!)Ya know just chillin out with a couple of good freinds can even be so fun and just a great memory tht you can cherish! Unfortunately poor Vivian never felt the joy in this kind of happiness! I guess most of us 'can't have it all'!"

"event","Sonnet 73 Shakespeare 

This poem is like a metaphor for 'life'. Basically life is just the old saying 'made up of moments'. Shakespeare's poem illustrates life beautifully 'When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang'. The poem contains many indicators that the poem is essentially about life as 'time'. Words such as 'bare ruined choirs', 'twilight', 'day', 'sunset fadeth in the west', 'sunset fadeth in the west'.  'Ashes of his youth' this line implies a kind of melancholy of the loss of time and youth. 'to love that well which thou must leave ere long'. Youth is a time that will fade for all of us- there's no point to try to revive it! life is made of moments and we musn't waste it or cling onto moments such as youth!William Blakes 'eternity' has similar notions to this poem.

"event","I thought Robert Frost's 'Mending Wall' was a purposely challenging poem to decipher in meaning and symbolism. After reading it I came to a few (probably totally off the mark) conclusions. Firstly I belive the title 'Mending Wall' is clearly ironic as the wall seems to cause issues rather than to mend problems. I believe Frost uses the concrete image of the wall as symbolism for the notion of the civilties and mannerisms of early nineteenth century civilised society. I believe his own philosophy comes through in the poem, ideas that a society which values such 'civilisation' will inevitably counteract the liberties of human nature causing problems, in specific with relationships. The poem often refers to the neighbour. The hunters he refers to in the poem that made gaps represent society in its social expectations- relationships were hindered as the neighbour and the persona built the 'wall between us' again. Relationships had to be deemed appropriate in such 'civilised' society perhaps the persona is having an affair or maybe the relationship is homosexual. This is what I got from the poem anyway!

"event","HEY ALLL!
This weeks reading 'O Taste and See', made me realise just how short life is and how many aspects of life there are to miss out on!!! I think the poet clearly promotes this idea, perhaps guiding us towards a more religious orientation of life or maybe a less material centred life. The religious overtones and the first line 'The world is not with us enough O taste and see' suggests there is something beyoind the life or reality of this  material world.  I just realised that I'm never going to be able to bludge and be as care free as i was in the 'after hsc' months!!! thats so scary but than again I guess that Leverton is trying to say 'thats life'!!"

"event","This prose allowed me to practise my new found 'reasoning' of which I had been inspired with from studying Poe's 'Purloin letter'. In 'Breaking Tradition', the persona, whom I believe to be Mirikitani, avails to her innermost feelings, somewhat 'wearing her heart on her sleeve', a point quite elusive to the reader when one encounters this prose . I believe however obscure the meaning may be, the persona expresses the regret she feels in the lost heritage of her family, as her daughter consists of the first generation in a foreign, contemporary, western,  society. Although the way the persona relates to her mother and her certain practises of this culture may not be of a positive nature, I don't belive either is the practises of her daughter, whom has given up the culture wholly, advocated by the mother(persona). This is evident in the negative connatations with the metaphor 'pearls displayed only as passive chokers' in reference to the perona's mother, and also 'her secretive eyes are walls of smoke' in reference to her daughter. Perhaps it is not the difference in culture that the mother is not fond of in her daughter, perhaps the mother disapproves of the adolscent nature in general as she alludes to 'music and telephones' also in a negative manner, and many of these elements such as socialising and secretiveness are general traits of adolescents in western societies. Although the persona grew up in a diffrent culture as an adolescent, I believe she also experienced similar traits of her daughter during adolscence, however did not entertain them, which is also a source of regret clearly outlined in the prose, such as the persona's state of being 'filled with tears of shakuhachi' the Japanese term refering to a bamboo flute, symble of her culture. The mother never entertained the thougth of truly 'Breaking Tradition' as her daughter did."

"event","Sunbeams, glint on water, touch my mildewy skin
and i flich at the feeling, and look above with longing 
Here i lay, in this realm, one short of reality 
I see them, through the rippling moisture, playing, joking... caring
together. Am i noticed? a notion seeming 
somewhat sereal,
as if serealism can exist in a realm one short of reality. 

And yet I feel them, coming to the depths to meet me
Her so loyal, and he....
just he . Oh how loathing eludes me

Even when she, truest of true, let me slip even further into the shallows
He scathed at her and they quarrelled
like lions over a mangled mass of life
I felt warmed for the very first time in my existence in the depths 
I glowed and all the little sea urchins were drawn to me
i shook them off and gazed with an element not far short of a life force
At him, to him, i was startled to notice how far away was his face 
through the rippling moisture
he and her could exist all the way out in the sunshine
here i must remain 
And there he goes.... gone, forever
Away to join HER who left me to sink long before he drifted out with the new tide
he couldnt feel me anymore there was too much water between us!
I was sinking further beneath the current away from the sunshine where i couldn't see them.
But I still felt him
and i heard him, through the rippling moisture i heard him with HER 
playing, joking... caring together.
And i sank too deep for them to care
My hair whipped about the ocean 
I gazed out above for one last time, one desperate hope
his smile- directed at her- I didn't exist. that smile- vice of my heart
here I lay, the coldest part of the ocean
I am so tired, although I've slept for my whole life
in a realm FAR short of reality 
where i await to ascend the murk again.
oh how loathing eludes me. But pain does not."

"event","The purloined letter- an insight into the character Mr Dupin; calculating, selfassured, insightful. This short story gives quite a detailed look into the working mind of a man of whom outsmarted two men of authority, a minister and a prefect (police officer) with the ability of being able to calculate their characters thus there intentions. Dupin unravells his tactics in reference to many an example which are quite interesting in specific, the boy with the marbles. The boy professed that he had won at marbles countless times in the game of odds and evens because he identified with his opponent by fixing their expression on his own face thus arousing their thoughts in his own mind. An unprobable mode of effective reasoning for many others. Although this example may seem quite abstract from reality, it may acknowledge that by just considering an expression of our 'opponent' may be significant in understanding them, thus empathy is a sure way of understanding someone, which many an individual perhaps forget to do when reasoning? Perhaps also it is suggesting that many an individual are not capable of reasoning or empathy, as both men, the minister and even the Parisian police force, are not credited by Dupin as having this ability. Even my interpretation of this prose conveys a reasoning as I delve into the possible intentions that Poe possesed and forwarded through this prose. Poe relayed this prose in an effectual manner as it has moved me to be more insightful, perhaps even when considering literature."

Can't be listened to below 1000000 decibels! Love it especially when experiencing 'rather uncomfortable'(check my mood) nostalga- (argh humm) Won't give details- galz out there who have had their various 'flings'- listen up!, well I happened to bump into my 'highschool sweetheart' today on the way home from uni. And in the risk of sounding 'emo' (pffffft) my only regret with this one was that I didnt take the risk of sounding 'emo'- I never said all i had to say... Drives a girl crazy. Hard to get over someone that firstly, you loved, and secondly, you keep digging up dirty secrets about LOL ( no i didn't tax this scenario of a script of 'days of our lives') neways as i said- avoiding detail. I just thought this song deserved some context. I swear this song can be applied to almost any situation, in this case i wanna give you an idea of where this song takes me. ""what's the worst that I can say? things are better if i stay' I totally rekon this line can refer to our big vendetta with being 'emo'. OKKKK i admit that there is an extent of 'emotional' that someone can go beyond that is annoying and not a little bit scary! But my biggest problem (and regret) was that it was so badly looked upon, as advocated by my exboyfriend, that for this reason, to this day i'm still not clear why we split up! LOL- giving too much detail? probably! but the context is a MAJOR issue!Would it really be the worse thing i could say?'things (life) are  better if i stay'? (baaaa too emo!!!!- sarcasm) We'll meet again When both our cars collide' Girls- don't you just hate it when you are so totally stuck on a guy (ex or whatever) when he seems to flick a switch and 'click' stutdown- in other words, he suddenly doesn't give a 'stuff'. Alot of my girl firends agree -  Why? Why? Why? are are guys also not taking the risk of sounding 'emo', I think in some way it catches up to all of us non-risk takers. Believe me mine and his 'cars' will collide if he ever fesses up (avoiding detail) but best to get it all out there. We're adolescents lets live up to our risk taking reputation cause non of us wanna live a life of regret- trust me guys, the old saying 'its never too late' doesnt always apply- it may not just become too late but too hard!"

"event","A seemingly random and unstructured text, Leyner offers some logic, although obscure, he offers some leads as to what he is refering to in his writings. Before offering some examples of this, it is also important to acknowledge that the story is composed in a 'higldy pigldy' manner which empowers it as an original, postmodernist prose. This prose is great in its easy flow and captivating chronology of the workings of one mans thoughts. 'Is ""happy"" the appropriate epithet for someone who experiences each moment as if he were being alternatively flayed alive and tickled to death?' I believe Leyner is not suggesting, on the contrary, stating certain 'happiness', though perhaps subconsciously, he conveys perfect logic as the notion that to live life as if you were dying the next day, is not unpopular philosophy for many (especially contemporary) individuals. Leyner conveys alot of his thoughts in this story and I believe Leyner becomes the persona of the story which makes it more intersting, and humorous, in knowing that the prose is perhaps not entirely fiction."

"event","Partial interpretation is the main means by which to explain this short story. In my interpretation, in the second sentence 'On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun', There seems to be an allusion to this place as having no means of concealing information, everything is in focus and 'out in the open'.. as if it is a paradox to the rest of the story. The rest of the story is open to interpretation as it does not allude to any particular circumstances. I believe it may paralell to the readers own experiences whilst conversing with people with ulterior motives or underlying intuitiveness. It can parallel to the readers own circumstance which empowers the story with an ability for the reader to associate themselves with the story, as the reader may have 'been there and done that'.  I think the way in which the characters are referred to as 'the man' and 'the girl' gives it a kind of 'feminist' vs 'masculine' context. In reference to this notion, the girl saying 'I just know things' is particularly humoring as it perhaps alludes to a woman's superior 'intuition'. I believe the reader is influenced to allocate the role of protagonist and antagonist to either the woman or man, a major influence on this such decision being of to whom the reader associates with more."

"event","Pride and prejudice, directed by Joe Wright, was somewhat of a disappointment. I  don't believe Joe Wright did Jane Austen's classic masterpiece justice. Sorry for sounding like a cynic! Although the casting for the characters was fairly well done as they suited the roles immensely, in particular Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy, I think the characters lacked the chemistry that many of the their relationships with eachother needed. In specific, Elizabeth's, played by Keira Knightly, and Mr Darcy's sentiments really didn't move me. I believe it was more of a shock than it ought to have been to discover Darcy's feelings, as the film does not show the gradual arousal of his affections for Elizabeth, as the novel does. The whole point of portraying this chronology of Mr Darcy's affections is in order to highlight Elizabeth's character as her witty and individual self- an element in the onscreen Elizabeth that didn't hit the mark as the wit of literature Elizabeth did. Therefore, the character Elizabeth was a bit of a let down. The love scene (right at the end of the film) was captured in beautiful cinematography, however if the cinematographers were trying to portray passion- it wasn't happening! mostly due to lack of chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy. I also think that Charlotte and Elizabeth should have had a more intricate relationship as Charlotte's character on film did not seem as prominent as in the book. However producing a film on literature is often a difficult task, especially as time restrictions call for alot of editing, and this is the only excuse i can except!"

"event","Well, I havent written in here for a while...not that anyone actually reads this *_*. I saw A Home at the End of the World. Very good movie...though, the plot did lack a certain something, it needed to be a little stronger.
Mmm-hmm....well, I can't stand guys anymore. Don't get me wrong! They're hot, and sexy, and i love watching them make out (btw, i love slash and gay guys! ^_~), but they're too much. I have three liking me right now, and i hate knowing, cuz then you think you might like them, but in reality, its just cause you're flattered that someone had taken the time to notice that you're alive. GAH!!!!! That's it! I'm swearing off guys! I'm a lesbian! Yup, I'm a lesbian! I can't stand guys anymore!
..........ok, maybe im not a lesbian, but I'll take a break from guys for a while.
For a while, I used to think maybe I was a bi-sexual, but my sister said that:(i added some of my own fancy words here) It's just the way society is now-a-days, they accept homosexuality so willingly now,(not everyone) that you're mind has wanted to make believe that you can be in that acceptance group. I still don't know if i actually am bi, and i dont know.....fuck! srry, just a little frustrated. But yes, i think some of my friends would be a little weirded out if they found out their friend was attracted to both sexes. Also, they might be a little wary around me just in case i thought they were attractive. Only two of my friends are hot.....am i bi? or do i just want to fit in? Boo comformity!! Damn the 'C' word, trying to make me use it in all its 'C' wordiness.
I need a life -_-"

And feel like sticking the middle finger up to the whole world! But things have been running really smoothly in life.
Except for the little fact that I ahve three guys liking me. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love that a guy even sees me, but, gah! never mind, i want even get started on that. Maybe another day....

"event","I never really said who I was in the last one did I? I am isilma. There, we were introduced.
My dream came true today! I bought a set of drums!! I'm so excited. Right now, they are sitting somewhere behind me, shining in all their spectacular glory! *sighs* Now all I have to do is find some lessons....More big news! My uncle was away at Mexico for the longest time, and he came back today! Wow, my life is just full of excitement today. I don't think I've been this happy in a long time...*looks thoughtful* But yeah, my drums, I finally got them. My friends have a band *cough cough* are starting a band, and they want me to be in it. But then my other friend, whom no one ever seems to pay attention to even though she's totally awesome to hang out with, says i could join hers if i wanted to. So what do I do? Join neither?? I guess we'll see *walks away*
(I am SO weird)"

"event","It's Friday. I was supposed to keep my room clean, and my mom would buy me a drum kit on saturday. It is now Friday, my room is clean, and i think my mom changed her mind. DAMN IT!!!!!! I hope she actually does buy them. 
Anyways, it would be pretty cool if someone would actually read mine.....wait....no...nevermind. If people actually did read this, they'd know what a freak I am...and no one is reading this...so I'm basically talking to myself. 
Moving on...Our school went to a highschool today, we were touring to see if we ever wanted to go there. So many hot twinks there!!!! But then when we got back to school, I was so tired, and we had gym. I just kind of..sat there in the stall....completely blank. Personally, I blame it on being tired. But then, I started talking to myself in my head (that's never good) and if you read this, dont say a word!!!!! Cuz, I'm over it, and I'd never actually do it! I'm too chicken-shit scare to....i think  
But anyways, I was telling myself to just stay in the stall, see if anyone would come find me. Or better yet, take my geometry set, and take the pokey thingy, and cut my arms, see how people would react. But that's just probably my sick way of calling people to me, of getting attention. Pretty dangerous. But ya, if I ever did do that, I'd probably get rid of everything sharp in my home.....I'm such a retard."

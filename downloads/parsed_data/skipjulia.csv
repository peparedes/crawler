"event","OMG i am so happy I had the best time yesterday hee hee.Will came over ysterday..awww...Nick and his girl friend are so cute before Will came in the house I saw them lookin up at me and Will wavin..*aww.....Dana is gorgeous i never really knew what she looked like all i saw was her back...lol. Will had to wait out side for a sec. until my mom  and grandma came home. He helped with the groceries lol my grandma put like three packs of soda cans in his hands...but he said he didnt mind.then  Will And I went in to the JaCUzi Room we listend to Muse...we sat in the love seat..i put my head on his shoulder i almost fell asleep then my mom called me.I was showing Will how i made the sims faimly..and i made one of them look like him..lmao it looks exactly like him..hee.. i did me. I tried doing Nick but no Hair could match that fuzz mess(*lol)...instead i mad e one that looked like Ryan(longboarder)..and some random little girl. Then we played Double Dash mario karts...*******hee...then randomly i put my legs on Wills lap and we started make out******HEAVEN****...i felt so happy....Like when i was kissing him i was thinking about how i loved him and how i care for him so much...and we are expressing our selves...lol..WE made out randomly the rest of the night a.k.a The perfect times.I felt so happy. The we looked at this dream book.  I gave him Nicks old Misfits Sweater..he wanted to wear it in front of Nick to see..if he would notice. He helped put a litebulb in for my mommy.My mom  was kinda actin odd.I put  a Butterfly tattoo on Wills wrist...And  he put one on My lower back..awww. Then like 9:00..we started watchin WILDBOYS we were laughin like the whole time lol i love tha show.*frowns* Than Letitia came home... i could tell she wasent happy that Will  was over...she puts me down about these situations..like last nite she said i have a bad choice of friends. And she said she wanted to get to kno Will more ..Obviusly not:(..o well  she went out for the night ne way..so me and Will..watched some videos..o yea he finnaly saw  THE MARS VOLTA video..he knos alot about that group. Will insisted on walkin home...butI wouldnt have that .I wouldnt have my Handsome Prince walk home in the cold. So when My grandma came home at like 11:17..she brought Will home..hmph i miss him so much..our only way of contacting  each other is letters. I should be getting one some time this week when he get stamps...His phone is getting fixed in a couple weeks...and he is coming over hopefully this saturday. But i am gunna go now..I AM so IN love                                  4:00

p.s here is my  Horoscope From allure MAgazine 

LIBRA:Tensions peak on the 8th when 
the solar eclipse brings suppressed
feelings to a boil and small problems
in relationships erupt into big issues.
Its up to you to figur out which ones 
can be saved,and thats no easy feat
THE GOOD NEWS:You'll end up with people
in your life who you really want there."

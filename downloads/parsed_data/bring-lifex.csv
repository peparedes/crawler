"event","Nothing has happened. I'm so unbelievably bored. I cant wait to go home, even though it means school is coming closer. I'm bored every second of the day. My parents are so bitchy. I haven't read even one school book and i havent even looked at the math packet. I dont want to fucking go to Notre Dame and my mom is wasting her money. Ugh, like i said im bored. So someone please call me....


Only one more week at this gay ass house.

 <lj-cut text=""I've got a bad feeling about this""> I'm not wishing anymore
I'm not writing songs for you
I sleep better in the dark
I'm not doing this for you
This is because of you I don't believe
Tongue tied an institute of my relief
You're my...my reason to shame
My reason to shame

I'm not wishing anymore
I'm not writing songs for you
I sleep better in the dark
I'm not doing this for you
This is because of you I don't believe
Tongue tied an institute of my relief

One wish: that this is over
You are all i waste today
Discarded, worthless, throw it away
Will it tear you apart?
Will it, will it tear you apart?
When I turn and walk away?

Abandon, its not worth the effort
When Stalling means
Too fucking scared to create
Abandon, its not worth the effort
When stalling and too scared

One wish: that this is over
You are all i waste today
Discarded, worthless, throw it away
Will I tear you apart?
Will it, will it tear you apart?
Will I turn and walk away?

I'm not holding onto this
I'm not wasting words on you
I sleep alone in spite of it
I'll do anything for you
This is because of you I feel relieved
Tongue tied to instigate what i believe
You're my...my reason to blame
My reason to blame


i'm obsessed with this stupid song. It's funny. I've heard it a million and one times and now is when i fall in love with it. <3 it. After Dinner Payback bitches."

Can I still see my future in your eyes,
or can I picture myself dead in your embrace 
And your cruel crimson red smile, kills 
Everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you 
Instead your greed compelled you to steal other silver linings. 
No one could have their moments free from your withering touch. 
Fuck off like you're the only person that has ever cried or been broken by love 
Spare me your pity party drunk off your own misfortunes 
Wallowing in your blissful melancholy 
can you taste my blood. You knew that this would kill me. But you carried on and on 
with your selfish shit., everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you 
instead your greed compelled you to steal other silver linings. 
burnt down my world, you killed my hope 
spread out the ash and walked away 
how could you just close off your eyes.
turn tail and run, you are the greatest coward 
<u><b>damn right I am still pissed...</b></u>
next time I see you we will see who has the upper hand 
kiss my fist. Taste the floor. Tired of your games. fuck off goodbye


i have a special treat for my next post. its half boy, half pig. guess what it is."

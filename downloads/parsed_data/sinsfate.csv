"event","Sorry guys, this journal is <b>FRIENDS ONLY</b>. I'm picky about the maturity level of my readers.

Here is where I store my more personal thoughts about life. Some of them will be turned into actual songs, others will just rest here. I also have a bit of profanity here and there, so I won't grant access to the 13 year olds, etc.

If you want to gain access to my entries, just leave a comment telling me who you are and add me to your friends list. I'll most likely add you back.

Live, love and rock the f*ck out!

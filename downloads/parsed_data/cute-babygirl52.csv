and a smile that makes me weak
I get shivers down my spine wit every touch 
when I got you in my arms damn I love u so much
Wit a body shape that no man can tame
and the essence of ur perfume drives me insane
I love ur style from ur smile,
To the way that u walk, and
The way that u talk
Damn babygirl ur everything that I want
Its 50/50 I'll treat u like an equal 
Its not that I dont trust u, I dont trust other people
Ur on my mind all the time, so I dream of u 
and wat we do, is wat we do its unspeakable
I would give u the sky if I could hold it in my hand
All this and i still aint ya man!
U need a man in ya life, that'll treat u right
Keep u warm when ur cold, so u feel safe at night
So..........hopefully these emotions will stay
But today is today and 2morro I'll love u in a whole other way

Lloyd Banks, you know
Cause a nigga thuggin don't mean he don't
Don't wanna see you smile baby

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Wooo! I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smi-ile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back
You're amazing in the sack
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black
God Bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back
You'd understand why dis feel like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes
Up and down

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks + (50 Cent)]
Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be (I be the reason you smile)
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be (I be the reason you smile)
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be (I be the reason you smile)
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be (I be the reason you smile)

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz
when you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
Wild drama, section 8 princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
Cause it's hard to communicate
Cause she don't speak-a no english
I been around the world from state to state
But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on
Cause I'm leavin in a hour, fly-through, don't matter she's mad
Even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile

"event","I'll never forget the way you made me feel
From the day we met...To our first kiss
I alwayz knew our love was real
All the dayz we spent together
All the memoriez we shared
Whenever I was feeling sad,
You were alwayz there
It'z impossible to describe the love I felt for you
How much you meant to me, I don't think you have a clue

Why did you have to go?
Why did you have to leave me here alone?
I'd do anything to get you back
To feel that way again
The way I did when we were together
Like I did back then

Now I know you're gone FOREVER!
And there'z nothing I can do
I guess I'll have to learn to live my life,
Herre without you

as I lye here in my bed.
There are times when Im so confused,
and other times when I just feel used.

The pain you caused me I cant comprehend,
I wish that I could just pretend.
Pretend you didnt break my heart,
pretend you never tore it apart.

You and I were once together,
so do me a favor and never say never.
Never say we couldn't be together,
never say it couldn't last forever.

Yes it's true I still think about you,
and I want you to know I'd always be true.
Hopefully one day I can say you're mine,
hopefully one day everything will be fine."

[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot
I got the rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed cause I got it going on

[Verse - Pharrell Williams]
Uh! I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can excercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street
Wit the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy shit
Trying to ask me shit
When my niggaz fill ya vest they ain't gon pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second
Matter fact, you should take four B
And think before you fuck wit lil skateboard P

[Chorus]

[Verse - Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
[scratches] ""two!"" - ""one!"" - ""yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

[Chorus]

[Verse - Snoop Dogg]
I'm a Bad Boy, wit a lotta ho's
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun so you wanna pop back?
AK47 now nigga, stop that!
C mid shoes, now I'm on the move
You're family's crying, now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to
Subscribe nigga, get yo issue
Baby come close, let me see how you get loose!

"event","Tearz of emotion run high.
Tearz of emotion, I cry.
Tearz for you...
The tearz you never knew.

So much am I confused.
It was the tearz of pain from being abused.
Over time thingz changed...
Over time thingz got strange

To be with you had made me happy
It was the tearz of joy to have you with me
Over time you left and never came back
Over time my world went so cold and black

Everyday I had wished for you to disappear
But once you left it was my tearz of my frightful fearz
For so long have I been alone
For so long it had been until everyone had known

It was the tearz for you...you never knew
That had pulled our relationship through
It was the tearz of emotion that ran high
Was the tearz of emotion I cried.

Hey Peoplez, I wrote diz 2night...who knowz why. I just did. 
Well I got to go <3alwayz n forever, Cute_BabyGirl52"

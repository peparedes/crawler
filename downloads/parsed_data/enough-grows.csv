I have left most things where they lay, but not everything stayed abandoned. A lump of cement found below the belly of a railcar has made its way into the bottom of my stomach. My dirty palm holds a red die. If I close my eyes and toss it can we say my luck unobserved goes both ways? I just want it to go both ways. Smoke from a celebration I have never understood clouds over the sky. That I understand; I have spent time blotting out the stars. When I cheer at the crashing and lights I feel a part of something. Bottlecaps tug downward at the corners of my pockets making denim frowns. Craft beer works its way through my system. Through repetition I have grown used to this call and response of noise and flash and I am left feeling too dull to articulate my thoughts.<br /><br />You know what comes next.<br /><br /><hr /><blockquote><a href=""http://asofterworld.com/"">Joey Comeau</a>:<br />Today is a good day to just start over. Be wary of saving too much money, because disaster could strike at any time, and I&#39;m pretty sure heaven is just you sitting there wishing you&#39;d bought an XBOX because it turns out you can take it with you, but there&#39;s nothing to buy in the great beyond. Be on the lookout for a new love! Everyone has kisses. Who is going to slip one into your pocket when you aren&#39;t looking? Your lucky numbers this week are: 1,2,3, all the way up to infinity. I am just saying. Shit is going to go good for you. Open your mouth! Get ready!</blockquote></div>"

"event","I&nbsp;went into my lunch break stressed out, recovering from really stupid anxiety, then I was pulled aside for a 10-minute work conversation off the clock... I hunted down the elusive can opener and a microwave. I&nbsp;poured my soup out of the can I&nbsp;brought from home and I&nbsp;didn't even want to eat it. I thought about throwing it away, bowl and all, and just giving up.

But I&nbsp;ate it.

And it was everything I have ever wanted from a soup. Thank you Wolfgang Puck."

Do they even realize or hear it?

I laugh at inappropriate times. Something in the beginning of a 20 minute journey that becomes the punchline by the time I&nbsp;reach my destination. It is a trail I&nbsp;have walked alone, a meandering path I&nbsp;cannot retrace; the markers were all temporary and jumbled to begin with.

"event","I have been broke, and broke I will remain until this Friday.<br /><br />A week and a half, almost two weeks, of very, very little money has brought me nothing but good fortune and good feelings. I had just enough to cover rent, so I have a roof over my head, and my roommates are not pissed off (and they're probably not even aware of my money situation). That was bad planning and a lot of luck. I had plenty of fruit that had been set aside for juicing. Instead, the apples and oranges go to work with me for lunches. Two dollars in couscous is about eight servings. I have a lot of oatmeal in the cupboard. I'm not at all afraid of going hungry. Actually, the only thing I can see myself running out of is gas, but since I'm not really spending money on anything else, I know I'll have money to cover it...<br /><br />I decided to begin selling crafts and artwork, something that made me feel dirty in the past. I love and prefer giving hand made gifts, but it is a great feeling to know I am producing products that people want <i>and </i>will give me money for. Yes, I could one day live off what my hands can make! I'm still in the set up of my shop and the production of a few orders, but I HAVE ORDERS, placed by friends and acquaintances. I am busy when I come home from work.<br /><br />Another great thing I have experienced since running out of money is the idea of barter. I've always been pro-barter at heart, but now I am living it and understanding it. I am ""cashing in"" on good deeds from the past: a friend of mine who was going hungry this fall until I dropped off cans of food at her house has been feeding me with her tax return and leftover student aid money. She's also trading me canvases in exchange for art. I donated some time to our produce department during our Superbowl rush, and in exchange I received a ton (well, about two and a half pounds) of free guacamole. I brought some to Constance's Superbowl party, and received beer and food, and when I brought some to Elsa at the coffee shop, she gave me a mocha. I gave Mike a ride home and he bought me a beer!<br /><br />Here's a story I found through bOINGbOING.net about Mark Boyle's attempt to journey 9,000 miles from England, across the Middle East, to the birthplace of Buddha, without using or touching money (no traveler's cheques or credit cards, either): <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/7217788.stm"">Think about it.</a>"

"event","Sorry to leave. Sorry to keep you awake. I don't even know what else to apologize for. Nothing or everything.

This is not good for me, whatever this is. I can't feel like this about you when you're so unavailable. Unavailable in more than just one sense of the word. You fall for people so quickly. I feel lost in a sea of those you feel very close to, people you might abandon for one or another of us, whatever way the waves may take you, towards whomever needs saving, whatever the circumstance may be. The circumstances are endless.

I don't know if there will ever be a right time for us to be together again, but this is not even close to that time, and I can't keep pretending and telling myself that it is.

I haven't talked to my closest friends about this week, even though I'm in the deepest depression, because I know what they would say. They would shout, they would yell at me, they would tell me to stay away, and I haven't wanted to hear it.

I have to take care of myself this winter. The season change from summer to fall has already been really hard for me. I have so many things I need to get done before winter is over, and I can't see myself accomplishing any of those things right now in the state of mind I am in. I'm too damn depressed. I need to go back into therapy, I need to make things right for myself.

I'd still like to be your friend, but I just don't know how I can be right now. We have too much chemistry, I don't want to let go of you once we touch... and I am just confused and hurt by all the things that have happened this week.

If we can be friends, let's do it. There are rules we need to follow that I DO NOT WANT TO FOLLOW but I have to. I'm not going to be a reason you leave someone else, hurt someone else, or hurt yourself. That is a terrible thing to be. Please help me with this goal. I don't want to feel this badly about myself.

Maybe there is something in the future for us, and maybe there isn't. But there is nothing good for us right now, and I don't want to hurt and cry like this anymore.

Love,
Laura"

"event","Saturday night, I closed at work. A few hours before I went in, I got an invite to meet up with a 21st birthday party after work. There's this girl I met recently, the cousin of that birthday girl, and I feel like she's been pursing me for about two weeks now. It's been a really nice change for once, so why did I decide to go home rather than meet up with her? She didn't know me in June, but she offered to buy me a drink, because she'd ""missed"" my birthday.

Oh boy..."

"event","I wanted to draw (yep, not take) a picture of what my dad brought over for my birthday--a desktop-size pretty flatscreen TV he won at the College World Series, and a DVD player to go along with it. I've been using the screen as a moniter for now, and watching the occasional DVD with the picture in picture feature. It's all kinds of distracting. I had to shoo myself out of my room for all of today so I didn't feel like a hermit by the time I turned in for bed. Anyway, <b>the problem</b> (and I like blockquote):

<blockquote>A few days ago, I cleared off 8GB on my hard drive, and in the process of doing that, I wiped MS Paint and also the preinstalled games that come with Windows. :/ I feel dumb. I was just giddy with the cleaning...

Even worse is that I don't remember making a system restore point, so I don't know how far back a system restore (terminology?) would take me... At any rate, I've installed, deleted, and rearranged some things since then and I'd really rather make that a very last option. Anyone know of a place online where I can re-download those programs? I'm not even able to reformat (trust me, I'd love to), because this laptop was refurbished and came to me without all the pretty installation discs.

I don't like to get down on myself, but in this instance, I suck.</blockquote>

"event","We're currently on a month-to-month lease. (That's news to me, actually!) We're probably going to go in and sign a 6-month lease in the next few days. At the very least, that guarantees we can stay here until January or February and then find a new place together, or split up (a prospect I am not looking forward to).

Our realtors seem to think it's likely this place might remain apartments. The trend on our block, however, has been to turn the apartments back into the one-family households they'd been previously. With a 6-month lease, we might be subject to new landlords, but if they suck, we don't have to be here that long, and if they don't suck AND would like to keep the building as apartments, we can sign another lease. Kala still has to talk to Nicole about it, but seeing as she just moved in two weeks ago, I think she might like the idea.

What a relief!"

"event","Directions: Write ten statements, intended to different people - things you want to tell them. Never tell which one is to whom.

<blockquote>1. I miss your face!

2. Sometimes, I feel like the unsuspecting character in a television show. You know, the one everyone watching at home yells at because you're beating me over the head with your affection, and if I see it, I dismiss it.

3. I don't know if you know this, but you're totally living your dream! Sometimes, I take a deep breath and say to myself, <i>Okay, what would _____ do?</i>

4. To this day, the names you used to drop make me jealous.

5. You helped me get out of one funk and right back into another one that was even harder to get out of, but I don't know if I've ever had more fun with anyone in the time in between.

6. You're easily the coolest person I know.

7. I can't remember a time I knew you but didn't have this low-grade crush on you. But I can't stand your friends!

8. You keep me sane and make me feel safe.

9. I don't think you broke my heart, but I think you rerouted it somehow. I just feel funny or numb when I should be feeling butterflies.

I'm no longer drinking under-age, so let's see.. my list of illegal activities has been chopped into splinters this year. Now I only break the speed limit occasionally...

I had a very low-key birthday. Jenni called me at 11:40 p.m. on Wednesday, because she couldn't wait until midnight. I miss my roommates! I am less homesick, though. I'm not going to acknowledge homesickness any longer on this trip. Instituting this new rule has already made my last two mornings more enjoyable. I went to bed late on the 7th and woke up early on the 8th to that simple solution to get me out of the funk I've been feeling. What a nice way to start this year!

<lj-cut text=""10-foot drop"">I put in a full day at the nursery. The kind of overcast day that bums me out sitting at home is a great day to be working outside. I sorted through hickory acorns for planting, graded red dogwood seedlings by height and cleaned up their roots for transplanting, and later on I ended up planting and transplanting those two.

I take Karen's keeshond, Lucien, out to the nursery on days she's planting or otherwise can't take him into the office. He <b>fell off a ledge</b> maybe 10 feet or so down onto the cement by where we were planting! I'd been nervously watching him walk up there. He stirred up a milk snake, but the snake wasn't really interesting him or menacing him, either. The grass had just become pretty overgrown, the cement ledge had dips and grooves in it, and he's a clumsy dog. I sent someone up there to call him away. I think he spun around too fast, lost his footing, and, off-balance, decided at that point to leap the rest of the way down. He hit the plywood side of one of the coldframes about a foot before he hit the ground, and bounced off that a bit. When he got up, he started limping a little bit. I went over to him, checked out his bones and his walk, and he seemed okay. I've seen him up on that ledge before, and it never worried me, but this time it was like I knew he was going to take a dive. I also felt like he was okay when he hit the ground, but watching that was so shocking. That's my car crash theory--Sometimes I feel like I can do nothing but sit back and watch the inevitable happen. It's been the same with physical pain, lately. I gave him a cookie, and we watched him closely the rest of the day. He's okay today, too, no stiffness or limping, and he even had a vet appointment this morning.</lj-cut>

Thursday night, Karen, Peter, and I went into Poultney and had a nice glass of Vermont apple wine. I usually have no love for wine, but I liked that one. We walked to the pub in town, joined up with Peter's roommate Chris, and I had a mug of a Vermont beer, called Switchback.  It was light, unlike my dinner... Everyone ended up very full, so we decided to head home rather than stay and drink. Karen made me a White Russian and we played the card game <b>Zombies!!!</b> It was great, and Karen kicked our asses. It's a game in which you're designed to die and screw the other players over several times before anyone gets away. No one wins with zombies...

I wasn't carded all night!

I crashed in Beth's bed, and had <lj-cut text=""the most bizarre and awesome dream."">the most bizarre and awesome dream. I was definitely male, and some sort of vigilante assassin, although I recall no assassinations in the dream. I started out living in a city with tall and crowded buildings of concrete or slate, possibly in a civilization of the future, although living dynamics seemed a little simpler. I lived in some sort of commune, until my first assassination, and then I was on the lam, for years and years. I learned how to escape by listening to those who wished to be my captors. They spoke too loudly about what I would surely do, and so I did the opposite. I learned to navigate rooftops and scale buildings, I made use of back routes and disguises, I discovered simple mind tricks and had one ally in the commune, a woman who went out of her way to open doors for me, leave the odd window open a crack, and provide me with intelligence until I found the money to leave the city. My last escape took place on a lush island adventure park. I ran my trackers in circles past animals on display, water slides, and ropes courses. I left the island by way of an unattended zip-line, and dropped into the ocean. I swam for a couple hours, to the next island over, which belonged to another country, and darted around customs. I think I was home free after that.</lj-cut>

I woke up with stiff shoulders. Karen and I went out for breakfast, I came home to see my kitty, and I'm blowing off work today (Murray says it's okay)!

"event","I'm spending way too much of my vacation on the internet. Next week, I'm going to try to check off a good 5 or 6 items on my photo scavenger list. I also think not being on my feet 8  hours a day is no good for me. I've got to get out and be more active. It's so hard when I have a little kitten who wants to sleep on my lap all day.

I can't talk about this in depth yet, but someone I know from work is moving out of state..! I'm so excited for her. I don't know why I'm not less sad, but I'm finally seeing moves as a great thing. I'd like to sleep on her couch, too, and I know we'll keep in touch.

<lj-cut text=""School stuff that's all been said before"">I've been a lot move motivated about jumping back in and finishing school. I have no idea what I want to do, but I could do so many things, and I can't put this off any longer. I'm going to focus on taking courses I love, and see where I end up in a year or two. I could easily major in English, and that's sort of my fall-back plan. I think I'm going to take one art course, one English/Creative Writing course, and one Outdoor-minded/Environmental Studies course. I want to work with metal and glass, so I think I'll be taking some non-credit courses at Metro...

The more I think about Agriculture, the less I want to do it. I wanted this internship to push me more in the direction I should go, and it has. I worry about start-up costs for a farm, what I really wanted, and I also don't want to be that tied down to a place. I want my own space to grow things, but I want to be able to move around a lot, and leave home for long stretches of travel time. I need so many things flying at me that I just barely master my techniques before I have to learn something else. My uncle is excited because he thinks he can talk me into forestry. He probably could very easily talk me into that! He wants me to go out to Colorado sometime late this summer/early this fall and do a 5-day hike with him. He's a ranger around the Ft. Collins area, and I'm racking my brain trying to figure out how I can fit this in, work enough to pay for it, and make sure I don't put off school again...</lj-cut>

The first week of July, I am staying away from work. You know, I give them enough of my time, and I've worked enough holidays. I'm taking the 4th as mine, and getting my stuff settled at home as well. I'm moving into Jenni's room, getting rid of my desk, getting rid of a lot of stuff. I'm coming to terms with Jenni moving. I don't want her to go, but we've got some plans for when I get back. I talked her into a concert, but we've decided it's too rich for our blood...

<blockquote>Jenni: I took the night off so I can go. How much are tickets?
Me: Ouch, $21.25.
J: UUUUUmmmmm...I don't know about all that... 
Me: Which is what I was thinking. :/
J: Hey! I know! How about we take that $21 and buy alcohol and just listen to their CD while we drink! Yay!
Me: Yay! Sorry you already took off work. :D
J: That's okay-it will be super happy Jenni/Laura night anyways!</blockquote>"

When I got her home, she hid. I fished her out once or twice, and she hid again. I think I'm slowly winning her over. Now, I can't type one sentence without her mewing for attention. She needs a lot of attention... I have a feeling she's going to pounce on my face while I'm asleep tonight.

I ran up another flight to tell Chris, and when I got back downstairs to open a window or two in hopes that I wouldn't have to catch a frightened sparrow with my bare hands, the bird was gone. I don't know how it got in or how--or if--it got out. The cats were outside, oddly enough stalking birds by the birdhouse. Dib even got a few feathers in his mouth. It was a dream-like morning, everything overlapping like that."

"event","Yesterday, Karen and I put two kayaks in at Glen Lake. We found eight turtles and a leach, and we played a rhyming game for 45 minutes or more. I can't believe all the words we thought of that rhymed with ""late"".

Today was Green-Up! day in Vermont. Karen and Paul from The Nature Conservancy took two trucks out, and with the help of maybe 10 volunteers, we cleaned up a two-mile stretch of road, overloading the trucks with unbelievable salvage from the marshy area. It took us about three and a half hours. I don't know what possessed me, but with my garbage bag slung over my shoulder, traipsing through mushy terrain and avoiding decomposing animals, I found myself becoming possessive of my collected trash, and my soon-to be collected trash. I would see a cluster of bottles and <i>want</i> it. Well, I'd want it in my bag and off the ground. I don't actually want to see any of the junk again.

I found a hypodermic needle (with top), two steel-toed boots (I'm not entirely sure they matched), and my weight twice over in bottles, among other things.

We took the trucks to a ""transfer station"" and unloaded. The things we throw away.

Tonight, we go to the cabin in Dorset. I expect to be asleep by 9:00."

<blockquote><font size=8>""FRESH COFFEE!!""</font></blockquote>
That's it. It was as good a reason as any to get up. I don't even care for coffee, but I'm <i>living in a basement</i>--my feet haven't been warm since I arrived here. I've come to lust after the warmth.

Chris is the roommate here, the coffee maker, vegetarian number three. Approximately a half hour after I stumbled upstairs the first time this morning, I heard him wailing on his guitar, singing ""Last Dance With Mary Jane"" of Tom Petty fame and ""Sell Out"" by Reel Big Fish. And he's good. Believe me, I've heard some bad, bad, <b>bad</b> guitar players, but he's good. I like Chris a lot, probably because he made me lunch yesterday, and he's always got a hilarious comeback... even when we're talking about... finger bacon and Gulf War Syndrome..? Yeah, he's honed his skills.

I'm going to take Lucien for a walk, and hopefully not get hopelessly lost."

Words are a commodity, and I've taken to wasting them. My descriptive skills have gone cold. I've recently busied myself with long, long lists of hard facts and thrown away the details. I'll have the means to remember everything in five years except my wonder and anxiety, and any passion I can drum up as I practice living in the moment.

"event","I'm watching Seth Green make an omelet.

The wonders of television.. Apparently, this is severe weather awareness week in Nebraska. It kind of threw me, waking up to sirens at 10 not on a Saturday. Eh. I'm awake. Going to make an omelet, too.

Wow, pointless lj entries again. Fun.

<blockquote>Horoscope
Quickie:
Take the advice of friends and associates when they tell you to stand up for truth.

Overview:
You make an enormous leap forward when you're able to accept that paradox is just a natural part of life. Reconciling two ideas that you previously thought were total opposites opens up your world. </blockquote>

<lj-cut text= ""Kelly"">Laura,

I'm sorry that the new relationship didn't work out
but its probably good that you realized it before
you got too far in. I have to say that dating is one
of the hardest things we ever do. There is always
that question of is this person right for me and how
do I really feel about him or her. It sucks. I know
that some people think that you just know when
you know but I don't know if I believe that. I think
that there are choices that you make in love and
you decide what is right for you. Of course, maybe
I'll change my mind on that someday when I have
decided that ""I just knew.""

However, your trip to trip to the Northeast sounds
amazing and like a great decision. One of my best
friends from high school used to live in Burlington.
She got frustrated with the small town living (we
grew up in a really small town but she had lived in
Chicago prior to that) but loved the outdoors stuff.
She and her fiance went hiking or canoeing almost
every weekend. They now live in Portland. I also
think that taking a leave from Borders will be a
good thing. Sometimes you just have to step back
from that place and take a break. I always felt
better each time I did it.

"event","In the kitchen, we gathered our ingredients for cookies. My mind sort of wandered as Jenni sifted through the random spice cabinet above the stove. She knocked over the cumin, and I swear I wasn't even watching it fall. My eyes had seen it earlier before my head went spacey, had come to rest on the label, and I read it to myself. My hand flew to meet it on its decent, caught it before it hit the floor. It was amazing. However, we did not find what we needed in that cupboard.

Somehow, I managed to find two left foot brown flip-flops as Jenni & I were leaving the apartment to walk to the gas station down the block to pick up our elusive ingredient: baking soda. I made it all the way downstairs before the lighting was good enough for me to realize, and I had to climb the three flights back upstairs to remedy this. She lugged down a bag of garbage and while she stuffed it in the trash can outside, I walked down the driveway, doing my walking slowly, looking at the stars thing I do, until she caught up.

At the light, we waited quietly to cross the road. I had a few in me. I broke the [Dodge Street] silence with, ""Y'know, I hate that I.."" drink a girl away after a break-up, I was going to say, but I didn't. I didn't because I didn't know what she would say, or do. I didn't because I didn't want to be crying when I walked into the gas station. I didn't because I can't remember the last time I had someone want to hold me and I don't know what I'd do if I did. My parents are so out of the parenting question, and I still feel like a child on my own, faking adulthood. I'm also not ready for reform, I guess. This is all I can handle right now. It keeps me out of my head. My roommates don't hear so well. Jenni looked a little hurt because she didn't hear my statement and I wouldn't repeat or finish it, so I crossed the street skipping with my arm linked in hers. ""I love you guys."" I hopped over a manhole.

I made Kala tell me she loved me a few times. I brought her cookie dough, then cookies, and waited around beside the couch until she gave me my tips.

And I worked on a painting while we waited in the kitchen. This is a good apartment.

I'm rereading Gaiman. Usually I don't have the energy to before bed. 
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream."

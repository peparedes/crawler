"event","Parking lot sits vacant
Everyone is far away
But all I need is right here
Artificial beams rain down
Illuminating cracked concrete
But it remains a bridge to heaven
Cool wind filters through
Thrusting chills across the pond
But warmth fills me completely

Your long black hair wafts gently
In the night breeze,
Obscuring my vision, protecting
Tired eyes from bright lights
Scattered across the empty lot.
Soft verbal melodies ride the gusts
Of vapor-infused air;
I take in both and savor
The rare and beautiful dark angel
Wings tucked away within the folds
Of your coat, sleeves entwined
And lost in the perfect indistinction
Blurring you and I, to us.

Stars lie obscured
Behind thick ridges of clouds
But a brighter light remains
Unknown forest behind
Threatens to engulf all
But here is my sanctuary
The hour is late
Sleep draws me close
But I've never been so alive"

"event","Pretty red and white and blue
With fifty pretty stars
Supposed to represent a nation
And show what our people are

But wars have stained the flag's proud stripes
And it resembles blood on snow
And the stars remind me of countless nights
With nowhere to go

But stay in my room and dream of death
And pretend to know what patriotism is
With a president who values his religion
Over what others believe

So before you stand and pledge alliegance
Remember these precious words:
Only by realizing there's no black and white
Can you save the world

Because if something is done strictly by the book
But there's evil in its results
Then it's better to do what's wrong for all the right reasons
Than to do what's right for the wrong"

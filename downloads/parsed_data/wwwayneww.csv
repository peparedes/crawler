"event","So... what happened this weekend?

Saturday:
1. Woke up early in the morning, went to the DMV and took my license test. Finally passed this time. :)
2. Visited by Jason's (my brother's)friend, Alen. He took us to this fancy Japanese restaurant for dinner, which I thought was a total waste of money, considering the fact that it WASN'T good at all.

Sunday:
1. Worked on the Employee Manual, cuz Aya (CEO) needs it for somekind of a presentation on Friday. Sent it to Michael (CFO) for him to make corrections, but he didn't change that many things, cuz it was pretty decent to begin with (HECK YES!!).

Monday:
1. Had a study group with Lana, Alice, and Stevie at my place. To be honest, it was pretty disfunctional, even though we did do some studying. Well at least we enjoyed it. :p

Finals start tomorrow.

The end is near...











(I meant the end of the semester.)

"event","Nothing much to do today, surprizingly. 

Started working on my new portrait, with Rosemary as my ""model"". It turned out fine. Took a test in Chemistry, messed up on two questions, but I think I did fine on the rest of the test (especially on the AP questions, I always do well on those). Didn't do much in math, as usual. Had a practice socratic seminar in English, and Ms. Selby had us draw weird symbols on the grading sheets. 

Got home, went on the internet, did my part on the pointless math project, had dinner, watched TV for a while, played the piano for a while...

And now I'm typing this entry. Maybe I should consider studying for the finals...?

"event","Oh yea, first entry ever (since... last spring?) 

Life has been as boring as ever, and school is totally being a bitch... The bad thing is, school has only started a week ago, and I'll have to wait another 3 months until the next ""vacation"". WHY CAN'T THIS EVER END??

Working on my History outlines right now. Even though I don't need to do them this year, I'm still doing them anyways cuz they do help. Thanks to Sarah Brightman I'm still awake (alive?). Hopefully I'll have time to rest a lil bit, since I still need to edit the employee manual for the next competition.

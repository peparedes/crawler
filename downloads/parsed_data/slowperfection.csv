"event","<font size=""1""> im so dissapointed. Today so far ive had:

four small cubes of watermelon.
two green grapes.
two doritios.
a cup of milk. [ 90 calories ]
a milkshake. [ 335 calories. ]

and im not sure about the calories in the first three things but ive probably 
had something like 500 calories today. god.
 im going to go exercise and beat the shit out of myself emotionally.
then take a bubble bath and crawl into bed. :[

P.S. fuck milkshakes. i should have checked, i knew it. and i didnt. God damn if i was going to eat that many calories i rather would have actually EATEN something. Why didnt i just get a diet coke...ugh."

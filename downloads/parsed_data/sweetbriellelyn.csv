"event","so I really should be doing atleast half of my summer projects but I'm not. I've done like 20 pages of the math packet not even, theres 90. I've read secret life of bees but I haven't done anything I might do the vocab soon, though. But I dont really know what you have to do for the papers because I dont feel like looking for mine, its probably right where my math packet was but I dont feel like going to get it.

I'm happy that I'll be able to see my friends, but I really really dont want to go back to school. Its going to be horrible this year I know it. First we have the psat, then the hspa. then the real sat. and plus college scoping and crap like that. I'm terrified. 

And this summer has been so boring, the most I did was go to florida and thundering surf. ugh. so boring. I was supposed to go to Europe. EUROPE!"

"event","I dont remember everything this week, its mostly working, hanging out with mike, and watching tv. But I do remember like last saturday I went to the beach with mike at night. It was the most romantic thing I've ever done, like my heart almost blew up into a thousand little pieces. It was something out of a movie (a romantic comedy) cos' in the beginning it was really funny because the blanket was blowing and we left our shoes there, and then I wanted gum and he kept running back and forth my hereo :D

and then finally we were okay and then PEOPLE CAME. alot of people and we were like ""OH MY GOD, I WISH THESE PEOPLE WOULD GO"" well kind of not really, but anyway then they left and we talked it was amazing. he is the best boyfriend in the world I love him so much.

Uhm what else has been happening. nothing really last night I went to wawa with michael, and that was like the only time I could see him.  

Oh duh the other night I went to see hairspray in atlantic city. the performers were good but it wasn't like philly how it was just like broadway only in philly. they didn't have any programs no intermission because they cut like half the play out! my mom thought it was fantastic because she doesn't know lol. I was highly upset but I didn't tell her."

"event","Wow, okay so last tuesday I woke up at 3:15 in the morning and soon left for the AC airport. Me and dory landed in florida at 9:00am. I met the two cutest toddlers in the world Shelby and Jojo. We were so tired we just slept while watching movies all day. then that night we went to downtown disney and shopped for a while.

Wednesday we went to Disney. We went to Magic Kingdom and went on splash mountain 3 times, haunted mansion 2, and then big thunder mountain, space mountain, its a small world, pirates of the carribean, buzzlighter, and saw philharmagic and stich.

Thursday we went to Universal. That was awesome. First we did islands of adventure. We waited for the hulk for a while and then we were like five minutes away when an announcement had come on saying it was being shut down because of lightening in the air. so we went on cat in the hat. then went back on the hulk, it was awesome. then we did spiderman, dueling dragons (fire AND ice), this little unicorn ride which was fast and higher than I expected, and popeye version of congo rapids, then we went over to universal and saw shrek with shelby and went home.


Friday we went to Typhoon Lagoon, that was the first time we had to pay for something because she knew people in disney and universal. we weren't happy about that. but we had fun, we went on this new water coaster called crush 'n gusher that went UP and down, we went snorkling and dory completely freaked out (a fish touched her knee and she forgot that she was afraid of being near fish), we did another set of slides too, and went in the wave pool. 

Saturday..... was the infamous day. We went to Animal Kingdom it was really fun in the beginning, we went on expidition everest 3 times (its brand new and was awesome), safari, somekind of congo rapids, then we went to mgm and did rock'n rollercoaster twice and tower of terror twice. this is where the shit hits the fan. we were talking to these kids one of them got the wrong impression and I told mike what happened and it was bad. oh yeah and before this I had lost my cell phone. then we get into the car and her aunt was really mad at us. 

the next day lets just say we didn't really leave our room.

then Monday came along with Nora and Rachel we did epcot with them and things got a alot better. we went on soarin', test track, mission space, imagionation thing, then we walked around the world showcase and did the mexico boat ride four times because our feet hurt, and the norway ride and shopped alot. 

then tuesday we hung around and packed all day and then came home.

I thought everything was okay with mike but I really hurt him and I didn't mean to but then we talked and its reallyl good now. well at least from what I can see. except for the remnants of his closet door.....

I mean so freezing that it hurt. you would probably die if you stayed in there for more then five minutes. mike couldn't even take it. anyway so we dove in once in a while, had ice cream, and tanned. then went back and took showers ate, and then a huge storm came. and it was chaos getting stuff inside and everyone. hahah it was so cool. then a little later after the storm we went home. 

then Monday I read all day in my bed, then at night went to a blue claws game. it wasn't fun at all at first and I was really pissed off because everyone got these remax tickets so they get free food and everything and actual seats. and we got lawn seats and were told that we could sneak in when the food is done I dunno, but we were pissed and walked around BUYING food while they were eating for free. and then we sat for a while and were eating and talking and finally they let us in. and then mike brandon and ryan did the baseball throwing thing where it calculates the speed. brandon was so bad. mike was amazing I think he got up to like 80, but the thing is really messed up so we really have no idea. 

Then yesterday was fourth of july and I went over mikes after he was done working and we went in the pool for a little bit, then ate chips and dip, then we laid on the hammock and fell asleep for while and everyone was talking. and baby brandon came towards us and was touching our feet haha. and then we ate hamburgers. and watched barney haha. then mike set off some fireworks and we saw people lighitng like realll fireworks down the street, and that was cool. and then mike rode his bike around trying to run me over while I threw rocks at him. then everyone left and we just hung out watching the fireworks on tv.

It was horribleeee. then when my mom went into shoprite and we waited in the car I read while they played lets find different stereotypes of people. they found a hippi, and were astonished to see two black people! and they were looking for mentally challenged, and fat people. mike said you win if you find a fat lady with her boobs down to waist or something haha it was funny.

then we came back and watched tv, and then we looked up dirty words on the online dictionary and made it say them. haha we had vulva, the f word, the n word, the c word, plenty of bad things. oh yeah and punta hahahhaahaha. cerro de punta! hahahaha.

But I was cool I was nervous a little but I was okay, omg if it wasn't for my parents taking me out before I would have DIED. But it was fun the other kid didn't get to go though because the guy was having a problem with his eye and had a doctors appt. at 12 so he was like you'll just go for three the next two times.

"event","Okay so yesterday I went to Ocean City at like 11:30. We got there and walked around with my Pop Pop (it was so aqward he's so weird) then they went to play tennis and I stayed with the workers who were my age. There was this girl named Jackie and she was really cool, and this kid Andrew. And older guy who I dont know his name. We put this net together that you hit against. It was really funny because they were doing a horrible job and had no idea, and then we finally got it. 

so then my mom and brother and pop pop were done, so we went out to lunch at this diner place. it was good except there was this old lonely guy next to us, and he was a regular obviously because the lady kept calling him frank and stuff. but then he started like picking his scabs I dunno, but it really put a downer on my mood haha. 

Then my pop pop went to work and we went to the boardwalk, I bought a belly ring and a life guard sweat shirt. god I love these sweat shirts so much. they're so comfortable. we also got johnson's popcorn and stewards soda. and boardwalk peanuts for my daddy. 

then we went home ate dinner and went back out to pick up dory, and we came back and wandered around eating firecrackers. and annoying michael. then we watched steel magnolias and we cried alot. and I ran upstairs and hugged my mother and told her that I loved her haha. then we watched the notebook that for some reason without even saying we both though of?? it was really weird stuff like that was happening all night. so then we watched aristocats, and we got tired so we turned it off and then when we woke up watched the rest and then the lion king 2. and ate bagels then she went home and here I am.


But last night I had the craziest dream that me and mike were married and I was pregnant and then when I went into labor I realized that we were married so I kept trying to have sex with him? and he was like are you crazy NO! and then I was like running around getting my video camera and stuff like that haha it was hilarious. so then we get there and it was a false alarm. it was just so crazy haha oh yeah and there was this 3 week old baby talking to me. haha"

"event","Okay so yesterday I left at like 4:30. and the whole ride up I just listened to my ipod sitting next to Jackie, while mike and josh sat in the back playing death metal on a fricken boom box, and annoyed me. 

Then we got there and it was really crowded, and I figured I was going to get lost and I didn't want to, so I was clenched on to mike's hand or shirt the whole time. and then we started fighting a little and I told him that I didn't like him anymore, and he told me to go home. and blah blah blah. but then I told him I loved him and He said ""I thought you didn't like me anymore"" and I said that I was just mad. blah blah blah. But I ate ALOT. And had a lot of fun. It was a really close game, and the phillies were winning the whole time, until the 8th inning and the yankees won 9-7 I think. But we left in the middle of the 8th.

Then we went back to mike's house, and me josh and mike watched tv in his room. We were making fun of Hulk Hogan. But mike kept thinking he was funny and telling me that I take up space. and I was like whatever and I stayed anyway. and I punched/grabbed/kicked his balls quite a few times, but he deserved it =] 

So then eventually we all went to sleep mike and josh slept in his room and I slept on the couch. Then this morning we ate pancakes and watched the battle scenes of saving private ryan. I really did have fun though. he wasn't always being a jerk. oh yeah and he asked me if I was doing anything later because he gets off work at 7, which is a big plus!"

I know that its just me and being absolutely rediculous, but I mean he doesn't even notice that we haven't hung out just us all day like we used to in a really long time. and yesterday I was all excited because I thought he was going to hang out with me all day, and immediately he goes over josh's. and doesn't come back for three hours. then just comes over cos' Josh had to put something away. and then leaves right away.

so then finally they get me to go swimming with them. and I went, but they're always like throwing stuff at me and making fun of me. but its not like oh all fun and games. its them ganging up on me. all the time and like he's my boyfriend and he doesn't care that i'm getting beat up, and attacked. HE'S THE ONE WHO DOES IT THE MOST!. he almost fucking drowned me three times.

And Today I was supposed to go the Phillie/Yankee game with him. Thinking it was like not that much people. But Josh is now going to, and I'm going to have a shit time. And josh and mike's sister are sleeping over too. so I'm gunna have to sleep on the floor probably, and just be ignored. and mike was like ""your gunna get mad tomorrow because me and josh are gunna just be playing video games and stuff, and you get mad when I don't pay attention to you"" and I get pissed off, when I come over his house at like ten o'clock at night, and he's watching hockey. and I came over to see him for like a half an hour or less, and he's just ignoring me. I dont get upset when I'm not payed attnetion to, I get upset when I'm fucking ignored. 

And here he was acting like when he was done mowing his lawn and the guy next door's lawn he was gunna come over. but he calls me and I'm like okay well when your done watering the lawn do you want to hang out? and he's like oh no i'm staying here. I'll see you at four. and i'm just.. gunna have a horrible time tonight. I dont know why I bother anymore. 

tomorrow i'm leaving first thing in the morning to go to Laura's. I'm fucking threw with following him around and trying to make this work. its his problem now"

"event","Okay so job searching didnt go that great. I went to the Horizon diner and they are making a decision. but I really have no idea what's happening. And I think I only went to the stoweaway grill and I was too young to work the slicer. We also got my dad a gift certificate to a massage place for father's day.

then we came back home and mike came over and mowed our lawn haha. but he took so long that when he was finished I had to start getting ready =[ so I got ready then I tried to talk to him for a little bit but then we had to go. My hair got messed up so I brought my straightener. and we dropped him off at home and went to my grandparents because we needed to feed/walk brook cos' they're at David's graduation (my cousin) so I finished straightening my hair there.

So then I got to the party and it was a lot of fun. Me Dory and Tara befriended this girl Brittany there. and we liked her, we're inviting her over my house on wednesday haha if she wants to come. So yeah we were dancing and eating and it was a lot of fun! oh yeah and then dessert came out nad there was a chocolate fondue fountain thing. and I had three plates of pure chocolate. mmmm =] needless to say I was off the wall after that. 


So today's father's day and we gave dad .. uhm cards and stuff. I dont really remember what other present's he got other than the gift certificate. I wanted to make a Ben Folds cd but they didn't download in time. so yeah I'm just going to give it to him late. oh well.  So yeah I'm gunna go and make my brother a live journal cos' he wants one? and then probably get ready and eventually go to my grandparents for fathers."

I just wanted to lay arounda nd do nothing untnil mike came over. because its summer and I can do that. its like 9 o clock in the morning and my mom is already complaining and freaking out. so she makes me get off the computer at 10thirty flipping out. 

So I have to vacuum the freaking basement and shit, and she took my phone away because I sat down for five seconds to write...? instead of cleaning my room. but had she come in a second before I sat down. I would have been fine? but she's the one who's going to have a problem with my phone being taken away. how am I supposed to know that she's out there waiting tonight at the party unless she calls me? or when to come home from mikes?

so yeah tonight is Kim R.'s party and I get to wear my yellow dress that I haven't worn yet with my really high shoes. =] I'm excited because that means doing two things in a row!! haha this summer I""m going to be doing ALOT. and tuesday I'm going to the phillie-yankees game. I wish it was in the yankee stadium though because I feel a lot easier about cheering. and I'm not going to like people cheering for the phillies or when the yankees fail =[ 

      well i'm going job searching again. probably back to the Horizon diner to see    if they still need me. I hate going back though because I feel like an idiot. I wish they would just call. but whatever goodbye"

So after that we hung out and talked to baseball people cos' it was his last game. then we went back to my house and went into the hot tub (so between the showers, laying out, the hot tub, the pool my skin is shot) and we were just hanging out in the garage and stuff.

Then we went out front and I was tanning on the hard concrete. and then we took pictures by my tree. Soon Mike and Josh came over and mike was being an asshole. and there was a catipillar that they spit on, and then josh threw it at me. I was really pissed of because it was just like he threw a catipillar at me. he threw a spit covered catipillar. and mike laughed. so yeah then they left and went swimming came back and went into the hot tub. while they were in there me and ashie were making a movie making fun of certain people =] I was a boy on my phone in the bathroom. haha it was hilarious. 


Monday I dont remember. at all actually. Like i'm thinking back and oh okay monday we gave the seniors their flowers from the sale that we did. it was actually very successful. 

Then tuesday was mike's mom's birthday so we went out to dinner to Calloway's. then we were going to see Poesidon. but they got the times mixed up and we were an hour late so we just rented underworld and went back to his house and watched it. 

The wednesday all I remember is that me and mike got into a REALLY big fight, over this stupid working thing. and he said ""FUCK THIS"" and hung up on me. which was the first time in history. he has never hung up on me. ever.

Then today was baaddd. it was the last day of school. and mrs. pepper, mr. wald, and ms. K are all leaving. so we were all just crying and I worked really really hard on the slide show movie thing and thank god she loved it and told me it was the best present she ever got besides her engagement ring. and it was just a day full of tears and oh god I was wearing my sun glasses ALOT. 

and then I came home watched the video from today, and the year book disc. and went to my brother's very boring 6th grade graduation which I had to entertain myself by zooming on people's butts and making fun of people."

"event","Its very hard to get a job when its already june, and you're extremely picky. 

haha so this morning I woke up early for a weekend at like 8:oo am. And I wanted to go look for a job so I got ready (which ended up taking a very long time) and left at 10. I went absolutely everywhere and everyone was either not hiring, had to be 18, or I didn't want to work there. So the only places I got a good response from was IHop and the Horizon Diner. The diner said they'd call tomorrow and that they were in need of a bus girl. If I get a call back I am deffinately not going to Ihop. I'm also going to help my mom clean houses, probably. 

But the first place I went to was Hearthside. haha and there was a help wanted sign so I got really excited and went inside and talked to the guy. and he said that you have to be 18 because of the liquor. and he had an accent and he told me that when I was 18 to come back and then he gave me a high five, he was so cool.

Then me and my mom went to pathmark (even though I told her that I wasn't allowed to go there, for support of my boyfriend we are boycotting pathmark but she made me) to get food and stuff for tonight. My mom mom and my granparents are coming over to eat tonight. 


Anyway well i'm going to go make myself productive. wish me luck to get called back."

So yesterday was a little bit of a rough day in the beginning, I completely failed my spanish final. which was really upsetting to me, but I have a feeling its only counting as a normal test I dont know. I haven't done that bad in Spanish in a while. If she told us what to study I would have probably been a lot better. And the acting final was due yesterday and I can't find the play that my monologue is from. so I just didn't do the two paged summery. and luckily I didn't have to go, because there wasn't enough time. 

And then it was the year book signing party and that was fun, there was a lot of food and the year books are really nice. I think this one is better than last year's. I'm kind of excited for the disc's with the pictures too. Kelsey told me that theres another fairy picture of me on there I think... or it was that she had a fairy picture of me. I dunno. Theres two of me as a fairy in the year book. one of me dancing, then one of me and katrina. oh yeah and this is on halloween I wasnt just wearing a fairy costume for no reason.

Then me and Dory caught a ride over to the galley for the dance/vocal club show. and we were hanging out for a while because we weren't on crew or in it so we had nothing to do. and then nora remembered that her folder was back at school so we got Loren to drive us back. and it was pooring. then it was lightening and thundering and dory's scared of the thunder storms. but it was fun.

The show was absolutely amazing, me and dory started bawling during Kimbo's dance to Cheryl. and then we didnt' stop until we went home. Everyone was really amazing. I love you all. 

So then I got home and saw that I had a hot tub!! I was home for like an hour then went over mikes, but only for like ten minutes not even probably. then my mom was on her way and I had to go home.

then this morning I went in the hot tub and as soon as mike gets back from josh's we're going in."

So Yesterday I went to New York to see my Uncle's new house that they're buying all the way up in the catskilles. It only took us two and a half hours. It was FREEZING but fun. When we first got there we walked around the town then drove ten minutes to the house. It was old. It has a barn, that was really cool. But we semi got stuck up on the second story of the barn because the stairs are so old we were scared haha. Then we went inside the house. It even has the original doorbells. you turned this thing and it hit a bell behind the door. Mia was asleep to whole time.

Then we went back to their house and had dinner. It was sooo much fun. Mia is so so so so so so so cute. I love her. she's my favorite.
then we went home. 
and I was asleep.
then I was texted at two o clock by someone who wasnt very nice.
But I forgave him.

Then today Mikey came over and we.. slept actually on my den floor. Then we went to Shopright (**excuse mee shoprite) then we dropped him off at Josh's house where he is now. Then me and my mom went to Perkins for dinner and gossiped. I love my mommy, she's my friend. :D she gets so excited when I call her my friend. 

Anyway now i'm bored and i'm going to work on my friends birthday present. who i hope is talking to me? then i might work out. goodnight."

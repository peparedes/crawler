"event","OMg i cant believe that scumbag showed his face at degrassi!!! if ur not up to date Rick is the scumbag and he even tried to talk to me!  i mean he put one my best friends in a coma!!  and how dare radditch let him in the school at all!!!  At least my friends, emma, jay and alex agree with me.  Wow i can believe im on the same side as emma, jay and alex.  but then again our hate for Rick has gotten the better of us.  I mean Emma came up with some great ideas to show him that hes not wanted here.  but then when Jay was gonna kick the crap outta him emma stopped the fight!  i was so suprised.  i mean before she threw him out of the dot and she tripped him too! and i thought i had mood swings.  Well I need to go vent to ash or hazel.. my girls are there for me when i need them!  But one thing is that rick needs to stay away from me or he'll be sorry

"event","well i guess i havent updated in a good long while. ive been so busy with school , cheer squad and finding myself a job.  When i told spinner i'd pay him back i was serious.  but like ugg its so hard finding a job... and keeping it!  But like atleast school has kept me distracted!  Did i mention that Marco is school prez?!  its soo awsome!  but i still cant believe he chose alex as his vp... weird thing are goin on here.  But like when marco told me he came out to his mom i seriously jumped him!  I was so happy! and then i didnt hear then end of it when i called dylan!  lol.  those two are perfect for eachother.  lol.  Well i better get back to job hunting  the faster i get the money for the car the faster he can get off my back.  but hey i love my hunnybee!'

"event","well the first day of school was yesterday.  and so was the trail against dean.  i've been like hiding this anger inside for so long that i didnt even realize it.    but like i was so pissed that he was found not guilty!!!  it completly ruined my first day of school.  i mean i had such a bad day!  first spinner breaks up with me (what was up with that) then we get back together then i totally flip out as were making out!  UGGG! this is all deans fault.  This is my year and i so totally proved it by what i did to his car!  ... i cant believe i actually did that.  wow.  lol.  it felt good like he finally paid... although it doesnt make up for what he did to me.  but hey its a start.  but unfortunatly this little whim of mine did kinda put a damper on my school year.  no more liscence, and community service... eww.  and top it off i have to get a job to pay back my honeybee.  its a little upsetting.  but i do kinda deserve it. i just hope me and spinner stay to gether because hes the one good thing in my life.  well i didnt really see  many of  my friends yesterday.   of course i did hang out with spinner, jimmy, hazel marco and dylan at the party (my friends always have my back) but like i so didnt see ash at all and terris still not back.  but like ive heard so many rumors.  ok ash and craig... friends?  im like omg its the apocalyse!  and them jt and manny that was not really a shocker but they did look cute together.  then whats up with ellie hanging out with alex.  of course it kinda makes sense since shes dating sean and thats sorta his crowd (aka the future convicts of america... canada whatever)  but like alex is not exactly cool i see her more as pond scum, dirt etc.  and then all the grade 10s.  Emma Liberty and Toby.  They were all so quiet yesterday.  im hearing grade 10 was breakup city this summer!  ohh gossip points!  well at least school has started and i finally have something to gossip about.  and on another plus side my outfits were sooo awsome!  well except for my party outfit that was total lack of judgement!  see ya monday!

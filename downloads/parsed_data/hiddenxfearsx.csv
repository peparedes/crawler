"event","I have no idea what has been going on lately. Sometimes the way she talks about certain things, gets me scared n worried. Like, last night...I started to cry all because she said she ran out of things to say and we never do that. I mean I had  so much to say, but couldnt cuz I was literally choking on the words because I didnt know if I should say anything. I wish I knew what was happening completely. I havent done anything wrong, except love her completely and thats wrong in alot of peoples eyes. Not in mine. Thinking of certain things gets me so physically and mentally sick that it kills me. I cant take it anymore, and I cant do this on my own. She cant do it on her own either, so what do to? I would, in a heartbeat, pack my stuff up and go there with her. I want to hold her in my arms and let her know she doesnt have to be alone, ever. Its just so hard to love someone with everything you have and everyone sees it wrong and wont let you be together. Yet, I`m not going to be a part from her. I cant. I would die. I keep telling mysef that I have to be strong, because people cant see how much Im hurting..that would make them question me. Thats not good.




I dont know anymore. All I know is what I already told her, the truth and nothing less. She doesnt deserve anything less than perfect. But yet, shes still with me and Im not perfect. You may think I am in your eyes for u, but Im only perfect for you. Other than that,Im the most imperfect person.  I cant see how you wana spend forever wit me. But, I cant see spending any less time with you either. I just wana scream and then maybe I would feel better, but that would require a voice, one I do not have at the moment. I dunno what I feel anymore. I am so numb because I have to pretend Im okay when in reality Im hurting as long as I am here away from her. I want to be there with her to make her feel safe, loved, okay. Hearing her voice when she gets in those moods, is...scary. I begin to cry and cant really talk and all I want to do is cry in her arms. Her arms is the safest place I have found. Her arms are my shields from all this pain and misery I deal wth every day.I feel selfish everytime I say this but I want her .. all to myself. 





I dunno..I could keep on writing things that are goin through my mind, this isnt even half the thoughts. But, I cant keep on going on and on.I should just go and hopefully she will get online soon. She probably thinks I went to school so isnt bothering with lookin on here. Eh I dunno. Well yeah... Linda, hunny, I love you and remember that. You are never alone no matter where you are and how far a part we seem. Just hold onto that necklace and think of what I would do..hopefully nothing too silly since Im a dork like that...but you know I would do anything to get you out of the pain you deal with. I love you so much."

"event","Why is it that I have found her...but I cant have her? Why is it that I love her so damn much yet people think its stupid and cant happen? Why...does it hurt? I miss her so much, I got one taste of her kiss, one touch of her heart and its like...I need it to live. Without it I feel lost, unable to function. I cant go one day without talkin to her. I mean, I could have school or work next morning and I will risk staying up til 3-4 in morning jus so I can hear her voice. My life revolves around the thought of her...being with her. Risking everthing I have, just for her. How can someone mean so much to me? I know in the end I am going to lose the people in my life that say they have been there for me but it is all worth it if I just have her. *sighs* I dunno..life i just so.unpredictable. 

Every day without her is like a day without a heartbeat, a breathe of fresh air. She is my heart, my breathe, my everything. I just wish people could understand that. Then, ....then maybe we could be together now. I just need to get away from my thoughts right now..they are beginning to scare me. Cuz..Im in love wit someone who I cant have completely and it kills me more n more everyday. Yeah, I gotta go. Hope to talk to her on phone..."

"event","So I was at school today and sitting in class like usual when I see my friend, Jamie, standing at the door trying to get my attention. So I wait a few minutes then ask to go to the bathroom. It was funny as hell,  I walked out into the hallway and she was lauhing at me saying she was trying to signal for me to go to the bathroom by swinging a imaginary penis I looked at her and laughed. She was like ""WEll, I know you dun have one....but I thought you would understand"". wow! So I got to say Hi to a friend go me! Other than that, school was soo boring. There was no sense in being there! Eh` it happens.

I had to work, as usual now. Only I had to work a lousy shift so nothin interesting happened. Although Erin looked at me strange and was like ""What? What now Amanda?"" God..I didnt mean to be lookin in her direction. Then of course, she had to say ""Killing me smalls"" all cuz I didnt do somin for her cuz I was too busy. I hate when people say that to me, espically when that person is shorter than me. Yeah, Im taller than people at work!!! Hehe..makes me excited.

Well, I dont know what else to really say other than uhm..lately I been feeling a lil confused, lost. I dun know why. Just..been in my own thoughts latly. That is always bad. Altho, right now I am talkin to my baby...so Im in a better mood-of course.



Linda.....what can I say. Been through so much already and have so much more to go through still. Hang on though..I`m not leavin ya behind"

"event","Okay, so its a new year,2006...the year I graduate from high school. This is supposed to be a good and happy year....then why doesnt it feel like it to me? Lately seems like all I do is sleep n work. Hell, I barely eat unless I am forced or start gettin sick from not eatin. I dunno what to do or think or say anymore to anyone. Seems I cant say the right thing no matter what I say, so why should I say anything?
I did have another username to another journal....but I was reading over the things I said and I realized I jus need to start  anew. Its the best thing to do, I think anyways. 

""Come A Little Closer""-Dierks Bentley

Come a little closer baby
I feel like layin` you down
On a bed of sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain`t nothin` that love can`t fix
Girl its right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby
I feel like layin` you down

Come a litte closer baby
I feel like lettin go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I want to touch you like a cleasin` rain
And let it wash all the hurt away
Some come a littl closer baby
I feel like lettin` go

If theres still a chance then take my hand
And we`ll steal away
Off into the night til we make things right
The sun`s gonna rise on a better day

Come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we`ve ever been
So come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin it down

Come a little closer baby
Just a little closer baby
Come a little closer baby
I feel like layin` you down



I love this song.....mainly because it is ""our"" song. First time I heard it really I was talking to you on the phone, thats why I love the song. What can I say..Im a dork like that and a hopeless romantic."

<lj-cut text="";A;"">
If you have been watching or reading the news, there is word going around that 3/4 of San Francisco's Japantown is now up for sale.

(refer to 2/9/06 front page of the SF Examiner).

The Kintesu of America Corporation's property and the AMC Kabuki Theatre is currently up for sale and from what they own, that equals to 3/4 of all Japantown's property. Many fear that a sale of these properties to people without the intention of preserving 'Nihonmachi' will ultimately destroy it.

Currently, there are three Japantowns in the nation, with the other two in San Jose and Los Angeles.

(<lj user=""soletta""> note: The San Francisco Japan Town is the best one out of the three. This is also relevant to my work because of the Asian Film Festival. The AMC Kabuki Theatre is where we have lots of the screenings.)

Being that I have been raised in this neighborhood and many others consider this to be ""home"" I have established a website that goes to an online petition to ask the City of San Francisco, Kintesu, and AMC theatres to demand that they don't make our neighborhood disappear from the earth.

Let's all remember that as a community, we should always try to preserve our heritage and support others that are struggling. I know that many of you have been to J-Town and/or attended the Cherry Blossom Festival at one point in your lives (especially when I announced the Cherry Blossom Festival in my Ating Tao class).

Please, I ask of you to sign this petition. The website is so easy! It is located at:
http://www.SaveJapantown.com and links directly to ""Petition Online.""

If you know anyone else whom may be interested in signing this petition at SaveJapantown.com, please tell them. The more signatures, the better response!



I know petitions aren't the way to go, but it's a start. I also want to post this on cosplay.com being that there are a number of events at Japan Town that do affect conventions. I'm afraid it's going to be locked. Even though I've mentioned that this goes beyond Japanese pop culture, it would help to gather more support than just posting this on my livejournal."

Reposted from MDYaoi's Y!Gallery journal:

California Gov. Schwarzenegger's office is accepting calls from anywhere regarding their marriage equality bill. It passed both houses of their legislature, but needs the Governer's approval. It's all automated, so you don't have to talk to anyone.

Follow these directions:
1. Call the Governor: 916-445-2841 (This number is listed at www.governor.ca.gov)
2. Push: 2 (voice your opinion on legislation)
3. Push: 1 (gender-neutral marriage bill - Senate Bill 849)
4. And push: 1 to support marriage equality

"event","Today I had a great lunch with my family. Since it's a father's day kind of deal we went out to Dim sum~ 
After Dim sum we all walked around as a family shopping around for clothing XD 

It's these kind of moments where you know family is treasured and these moments are precious~ 

I thank my dad for putting up with me and dealing with a stubborn daughter and always helping me out when times are in a pinch for me. 

My dad is a superman! ^o^/ 

I also appricate those that are always sticking by me through thick and thin, you guys may not know it but I am horribly greatful for you guys in my life. Honestly there is nothing better than friends and commrades by you whenever they are there for you. 

Oh man AX is soon! I will be in the artist alley trying to sell my small fry stuff. If you come by I will be in most happiness~! Trying to make AX a vacation for once!

ouuuu I just downloaded the new L-arc album and it's sooo good *O*"

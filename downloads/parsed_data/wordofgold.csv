"event","<font style=""font-size:8pt; line-height: 13px"" face=""arial"">I decided to take some more pictures before I left for Innsbrook. Speaking of Innsbrook, I will have plenty of pictures from there to put up when I return. :)) (Hopefully, if I don't get too distracted by Henry's wide vibrato.)

Laura came over, and we watched so many awesome movies, and ate so much good food (90% of it being sushi.) We opened all the windows in the family room to let the light shower in as we went through our senior books and college catalogs. It was very nice! We watched <i>Hot Chick,</i> bringing about many laughs, and <i>Creepshow,</i> bringing about many shivers, but <i>The Green Mile</i> was the best. Kris stopped by to bid a farewell before his adventures with Blake and Devin in basic training. It was gorgeous outside.

<b>The Calico Bowl</b>

Once set upon a shelf for years,
Like a child
He takes a sparking interest into its hidden treasures

And so the day he seeks to claim his eternal contentment,
Unaware of its fragility,
Fooled by its bold colors,
Pieces lay strewn on the floor.
And with no treasures, there is no worth.

So lay the calico pieces
Of a girl who once maintained her false beauty
From a distance"

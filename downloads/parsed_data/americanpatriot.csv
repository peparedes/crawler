"event","I've posted before that I sing with the National Philharmonic.  But I shall elaborate!

Back in February, the Philharmonic performed for the opening of the new Music Center at Strathmore in Maryland.  Think Kennedy Center, only better.  I'm not kidding -- this place is hands down, the most amazing facility I've seen.  The concert hall is acustically engineered to have the best possible sound, and its <i>awe-inspiring</i> to look at.  It seats roughly 2,000 I believe (though don't hold me to that), and is all hardwood, smooth silver metal, and wide open.  It was designed by the same team that designed the Osawa Hall at Tanglewood (subtext: this is a big deal).

<i>Please</i> check it out so you can see the amazement for yourself:  http://tessy.strathmore.org/facilityrentals/musiccenter/photoalbum.asp?page=1

(If that doesn't work, go to www.strathmore.org and search for the photo album.)

The thing that gets me is, that I SING HERE.  I am a member of the National Philharmonic, and this is our home!  I don't mean this to brag; I simply mean that I am blown-over by the fact that I'm a part of this.  Its insane!

Philharmonic life is awesome.  The opening concert at Strathmore will forever be etched in my memory.  We performed Beethoven's monumental Symphony No.9 (that's the ""Ode to Joy"" one that you all know), and it was magical.  <i>""Freude!!""</i> (Joy!) we sang!  And to make the experience even more meaningful, everyone I love was there:  (Dad sings in the chorus too, so that's a given) Mom, Danny, Matthew, Jamie, Professor Huszti... it was unreal.  The Gages and the Harbourts came too, and that was so wonderful to have them present.  They were quite impressed.  

Being on stage with a professional choir is unreal.  I still can't believe <i>I'm</i> in a professional chorus.  Well... to be p.c. its semi-professional because the choir isn't paid... yet.  The orchestra is paid.  (Damn violins.)  But, they're looking to pay us sometime in the next few years.  Obviously, I don't sing with this group for the extra income.  :-P  I sing with them because I love them.  Our <i>sound</i> is professional.  The people are a blast.  And our directors, Stan Engebretzen and Patrick Walders are phenomenal teachers/conductors.

This past weekend, we just did Mozart's <i>Requiem</i>, which is eerily ironic, since the Pope died the same day.  I suppose it was an appropriate performance.  Personally, I sang better in the Mozart than I did in the Beethoven, but my voice is better suited to earlier music than the great Romantic stuff.  No blasty-horned-helmet vibrato for me, thank-you-very-much.  

The Philharmonic Singers are amazing as well.  Officially, I like singing with them better than the big group, mostly because my voice blends better there.  We specialize in choral chamber music, rather than the large masterworks.  That's the kind of music that truly makes my heart burst.  The wrenching suspensions of early(typically) choral chamber music make my limbs quiver.  This kind of music presses into me.  There's nothing like it.

The next big Philharmonic performance is Orff's <i>Carmina Burana</i>.  While this is a fun piece, its not the most meaningful (the text is all about lusty wenches and beer-gulping abbots), nor is it all that musically challenging.  Frankly, this is one of the works that my musical education has caused me to like <i>less</i> than I did before I majored in music.  Oh well.  It still has some cool moments.  After that, our last concert of the season will be selections from Ravel's <i>Daphnis et Chloe</i>.  (Appologies for lack of French accents; I don't know how to get them on LJ.)

The Spring Singers concert is coming up in May.  We're doing a shmultsy Mendholsson springtime set, the Busto <i>Ave Maria</i>, a 20th-century piece called ""The Bluebird"", Candide's ""Best of All Possible Worlds"" (oy), and the women are doing a <i>Lux Aeterna</i> by a female composer - Michelle Roueche - who apparently writes a lot like Patrick (Walders, our director).  This piece is sooooo cool because in the middle, all of us do a free-form thing where each of us sings the main motive, but all at different times, as fast or slow as we want it, and in whole or part - essentially playing with the motive however we want.  It is the coolest effect; when its done in the church we perform in, it will truly sound ethereal.

*sigh* I love music.  I'm <i>in love with it</i>, second behind Matthew.  ;-)"

"event","Exciting update on the job front!

Friday I received a call from Byron to let me know that they'd like me to come in for a third interview sometime either Monday or Tuesday.  Yay!!  He also said the pay is looking something like $13-$13.50/hr, so that's awesome!  Before the thrid interview, however, I needed to fill out the formal application for employment, so he sent it to me via email.  I spent Friday afternoon filling this thing out; it was insane.  I had to write a statment concerning why I wanted to work with the Palau Association, and fill out a page on all of the jobs I've held in the last 10 years.  Oy.  Then, I had to write what church I belong to, and how I'm involved there.  Eeep.

So, I wrote that I am a member of Nativity Catholic, and that I teach CCD there.  But I also wrote that I've been attending South Run Baptist, though I'm not yet a member. 

Yes, I said not <i>yet</i>.

Funny, isn't it.  Did you ever think I'd be a <i>Baptist</i>?  Heh.  But that's for another post.

I faxed in the application, along with my original cover letter and resume, in case the Portland office wanted those as well.  The third interview is via conference-call with the headquarters in Portland, Oregon.  When I had the first interview, Byron told me that if they want me for interview #3, I'm essentially hired.  So.... let's keep our fingers crossed and say some prayers.

Today I got an email from Byron, saying he got my faxed application, and that they're looking at a Wednesday interview at the earliest.  That's ok.  I'm just glad to be having one.  

It looks like I might be about a week away from employment... but I won't celebrate until I know for sure."

Where shall I even start?  So much has happened.

Well, remember that awesome dental assistant job I interviewed for?  The one that had great hours, an amazing benefits package, and was going to pay me a lot?  Yeah.  It seemed a shock to me, but two Saturdays ago I got a letter in the mail from the Dr's office, saying that they were sorry to inform me of the news, but they found someone else with ""more particular credentials"" for the job.  A 'nice' way of saying they found someone who had previous dental experience.  

It was quite a blow for a number of reasons.  One, I thought I might have had it.  The interview went <i>so</i> well.  The doctors really seemed to like me.  They were very willing to train.  And as I was leaving, the head doctor said, ""Well, we're <i>very</i> interested.  We just want to make sure you are too...?""  To which I responded with an enthusiastic, ""yes, very much so,"" and a smile.  ""Great!"" he said.  ""We'll definitely be in touch, then!""  So <i>what</i> went wrong?  

The only thing I can think of is that someone else came in for an interview after me and blew them away with prior dental experience.  I don't mean to sound stuck up, but I did a damn good job in that interview.  And they loved my resume.  So, unless they were lying, I know they were interested.  It doesn't make sense.  Saturday, I was angry.  Then mildly depressed.  I felt pathetic.  How is it that I can have an awesome degree, an above-average set of skills, an impressive resume, and I can't get a job?  What's wrong with <i>me</i>?  

But, one is not productive if one dwells on her lost battle.

So, I spent the rest of Saturday and Sunday in thought and reflection.  A few weeks ago, Pastor Wayne informed me of a job opening with the Louis Palau festival for the DC area.  He said they needed administrative assistants; the pay was $13-15/hr, no benefits, but in a Springfield office, the job lasts until October.  Initially, I half wrote it off, since there weren't any benefits, but then I went through the whole dental assistant issue.  I realized, right now, I'm uninsured and have no paycheck.  If I was working with the festival, I'd have a paycheck.  Maybe then I could at least insure myself.  

Monday I got down to business.  I figured out insurance stuff with Mom's help, and I worked on a solid, heart-felt cover letter for the Festival people.  The more I thought about this job, the more I felt it might be a really good opportunity for me.  For those who don't know, the DC Festival with Louis Palau is one of many Palau festivals that hit major cities around the US and South America.  Its focus is Christian Evangelism, but in ways that reach a modern audience.  The best known Chrisian music artists perform, Christian extreme sports athletes put on demonstrations; there are talks with Louis Palau, an area for kids, lots of food, a sports zone, etc.  And its all completely free.  

So, I told them about my faith in my cover letter.  I put it on the line.  And then I faxed it in, along with my resume, and waited.  The next day I got a call.  

This Tuesday I had an interview.  We opened in prayer.

Three people interviewed me; Byron, Trish, and Amy.  The first question they asked me wasn't for me to tell them about my prior jobs.  They simply said, ""tell us about yourself, and your faith.  Tell us about your conversion experience.""  (In this context, 'conversion' simply means how I 'entered into a life in Christ').  So I told them.  No holding back.  I knew complete honesty might worry them a little (being I'm split in a Catholic and Baptist Church currently), but I figured I should just put it all out there.  And that's what I did.  

They asked me about my job at Nordstrom, what I liked, what I didn't like.  They asked me what causes stress in my life.  They asked me how I delt with it.  They told me about the Association's goals and mission.  They asked me where I see myself in faith in 5-10 years.  They even asked a little about Sweet Briar.  I got a good vibe from them during the whole thing - it wasn't a high-pressured interview.  The three of them genuinely seemed to care about me as a person.  At the end, they told me that they had 6 or 7 more people to interview, so they should get back to me sometime in the next two weeks.  Also, they told me that the interview process is in three stages: the first one (which I was currently involved in), a second interview with Doug, the head guy in the office, and a thrid interview with the Portland office by phone.  Following that was a personality test, too.  But, Byron said, ""if they have you come in for that third phone interview, you're essentially hired.""  

Then they asked me to close them in prayer.  I prayed that they find the right person for the job, and that God put me, also, where I need to be.  I asked that He bless us, and the Festival all together, and that the Festival help lead to true conversion for many.    

I left feeling good about the interview, but not overly confident.  On my drive home, I thought about my dental job interview and experience.  I figured that if they found someone who had more dental experience than me, surely the Festival people will find someone with a stronger church-rooted faith than me.  I grimly laughed that prospect that even my faith might not be ""marketable"" enough.  A little disheartened, I prayed.  At that point it was in God's hands; I put everything on the line for those guys in the interview.  They either were impressed by my honesty and my journey in faith, or they were worried that I'm not ""firmly planted"" in one congregation.

A few minutes after I got home, the phone rang, and my mom brought it to me.  ""It's the Palau people,"" she said.  Amy was on the phone.  ""Well, we discussed some things after you left -- heh, did you just get home?  Anyhow, we'd like to know if you can come in tomorrow for the interview with Doug.  How's 1:30?""  She also told me that they'd like to see what I can do on Micorsoft Office programs, so the interview would be with Doug, and on a computer as well.    

Needless to say, I was rather plesantly surprised!  They must have liked me!  This was certainly a good sign.  Perhaps they saw a little bit of what my faith looks like, in spite of the two-church thing.

Tuesday night, I skipped choral rehersal (during performance week - its a miracle they're going to still let me perform on Saturday), and Matthew gave me a crash course in Word and Excel (we had briefly gone over Outlook the night before).  Thank gosh, too, because the first thing the Festival office had me do yesterday was an excercise on Excel.  

Anyhow, I got through the computer excercise rather well, and they were seemingly encouraged.  Then I had the round two of questions from Doug, supplimented by Trish and guy-whose-name-I-can't-remember.  This time, the questions were more personality-based:  Did I pull a lot of all-nighters in college?  During a party, am I the one up on the tables dancing, or do I prefer to mingle?  What books am I currently reading?  What was a situation in my last job that was stressful?  How did I handle it?  Do I prefer order, or a little interruption?  Do I get easily stressed out?.... etc.  

At the end of the questioning, Doug said he thought I'd enjoy the Database Coordinator position more so than the Receptions Operations position.  Trish looked mildly puzzled, but didn't say anything at the moment.  Doug was in a rush, but as he was getting up to leave, he said, ""Great!  Well, let's see if we can't get her on the phone today... oh - Trish, maybe you can show her what some of the tasks are for the Database Coordinator?""  So Trish took me to her office where she proceeded to show me what was involved in Database Coordination.  Eeeep.  The more she showed me, the more alarmed I became (think countless hours of computer data-entry).  Then she said that I'd also be responsible for maintaining the website.  Ha!  I must have really wowed them on Excel.  :-P  Then she said very kindly, ""hey -- if you're not into this - and that's totally fine because it is kinda boring - just let me know, because we still really need a receptionist.""  So I asked her to tell me a little more about the receptions job, and then told her that I would MUCH prefer that.  She smiled and laughed and said, ""you know, I thought so!  When Doug said 'Database Coordinator,' I was a little confused.  I'll let him know.""

So, I gathered up my stuff, followed Trish out of her office, and shook hands with her and the guy-whose-name-I-can't-remember.  Doug was in a meeting, but Trish said they'd be in touch with me sometime this week.

And now?  I continue to wait.  

I'm going to try not to get too excited about this job, because I really could.  The people are all awesome.  I would <i>love</i> to work in an office where the people pray together.  And yeah, the job will look great on my resume, but mostly, the experience of working for a cause I believe in will be worth so much more.  I figure I'll view it like a paid internship:  no benefits and temporary, but something I do for the <i>experience</i> rather than the monetary value.  Its an opportunity that I most likely will not have again: the opportunity to work in an office with faith-centered Christians, who are united in the greater cause of spreading the Good News.  These people really <i>live</i> their faith.  I've never had the chance to surround myself with a whole group of people like this before.  It might really be what I need right now, too, especially since home is so devestatingly draining, and I can't fully be involved at South Run (the other church I'm attending, along with Nativity).  This job would welcome my faith, instead of being burdened by it.  

But God's will be done.  I suppose I'll hear soon enough."

"event","So here's the scoop on the job front:

Last Monday, I worked all day on preparing a fabulous cover letter for the job of Dental Assistant at a prominent Periodontology office in Burke and McLean.  This is the second D.A. (heehe) job I applied for; the first never called me back, and after I called them back for two follow-ups, they told me the position had already been filled.  Booo.  So, last Monday I spent the day editing and re-editing.  I edited online with Matthew while he was at work, and I emailed my letter and resume to his mom to look over as well.  Mrs. Barclay has a habit of obtaining every job she applies for, so Matt and I figured her input couldn't hurt.  :-P

So, after I polished my letter with the help of Matthew's mom (she gave some awesome advice, let me tell you!), I prayed, and faxed it off to the Dr's office around 5PM, close of business day.

The very next morning, I was awakened by a phone call from the office (8:50 AM, mind you!).  ""Hello, Kristin?  This is S---- from Dr.------- and Dr. -----'s office.  We recieved your letter and resume this morning, and the doctors looked it over and well, honestly, they were very impressed.  They're quite excited, and they'd like you to come in for an interview.  How's next Tuesday?""

WOO!  So, fast-forward to today, the interview day.  It was awesome!

I'll spare a detail-by-detail account, but essentially, they really liked me and I really liked them.  YES!  The practice is excellent -- the doctors have won numerous awards for being at the front of their 'industry.'  The office was clean and professional, the staff was friendly, and the doctors were friendly as well.  I nailed all of the questions, and they appeared to be increasingly impressed.  All in all, it was a lovely interview.  I wasn't overly nervous, and they didn't try to make me nervous.  

The profile:  I would work at both offices, Burke and McLean.  Benefits are awesome: Medical plan covers 75% of medical costs (wow).  401K is available.  And the salary:  $16/hr STARTING.  That's $32,000!!!  WOOO!  And its a standard 35-40 hour work-week, hours from 7AM-4PM (5PM on bad days occasionally if its insanely busy for some reason).  And there's opportunity for salary growth, up to ~$22/hour. 

So, this is all very exciting.  I wasn't offered the job right then and there, but it looks promising.  The main doctor said he was very interested and that they would get back to me sometime this week, and let me know either way.  

So, say some prayers!!  This could really be good.  In this job, I would get a chance not only to work with people, but to actually <i>help</i> people.  And who knows where my ministry can go with a job like this.  I'm excited.  I really hope this all works out.

<i>Thank you, Father for this successful interview!  Your will be done here.</i>"

I know I have a fan club out there somewhere.  :-P

Anyhow so yes.  Where shall I begin?

<b>Jobs</b>
One word to describe the job search and quest for finding out what it is I <i>really</i> want to do: confusing.  Its beyond confusing, really.  See, I go back and forth.  Do I need to be fulfilled in my <i>job</i>, or do I just need a job to accomodate the things in my life that are <i>already</i> fulfilling?  (This is a rhetorical question, mind you.)  After I answer that, I need to think about two different paths to take: teaching or not-teaching.  I think a part of me is always going to be a teacher, whether its doing it as a career, or teaching Sunday school.  If I go the teaching route, I'd probably teach elementary music (Tiff, I could use your advice on some stuff sometime, regarding that!), although that could change.  But, I am not certified.  I could teach privately, but that doesn't earn me as much as public school teaching.  So... ok... get certified, right?  Sure!  Anyone want to lend me $8-10 thousand for the certification program here at GMU?  Yeah.  And let me tell you, the idea of taking another loan is enough to make me cry.  Not to mention the certification program is a year-long program -- if you're doing it as a full-time student!  So, suffice it to say, this is a long and difficult (and expensive) road to get into a job I'm not entirely sure I'd love.  

So then we have the non-teaching jobs.  What am I looking at?  Well, you may laugh, but honestly, I am intrigued by two possible job-prospects as a Dental Assistant.  It sounds nuts, I know.  But they're willing to train, and its a job that I think could be kinda cool.  Plus, its a 9-5, M-F kind of gig.  I won't have to plan lessons or deal with school parents.  And, it would give me a set of marketable skills to take around with me, should I eventually move away from NoVa.  Yeah... we'll talk about that next.

<b>NoVa</b>
I never thought I'd say it but:  I am not in love with NoVa.  In fact, its grating on me.  Its over-crowded and loud and constantly busy.  There is no such thing as ""rush hour"" because its <i>always</i> rush hour.  Yes, we have nice shopping.  And yes we have nice organic food markets.  But I'm not sure how much longer I can take the people-smog and the congestion.  Honestly, its freaking hard to breathe around here.  And everyone is a clone:  a suit-wearing-DC-jobing 20-40-something who is making a great paycheck, but can't afford a puny townhouse.  Bleh.  A tiny one-bedroom apartment here is at <i>least</i> $1200, and if you want an efficency apartment in the ghetto, you can pay the mere $800 a month and risk your life.  Fun.  And then there's the mentality.  A frightening ""all about me"" attitude (though I know this is everywhere), mixed with a ""we're better"" arrogance.  Around here, if you aren't one amongst the clones, you're freakish.  But more than that -- you're a loser.  If you don't have a DC alphabet-soup job, you must be lazy.  If you don't have a Lexus, you must be unmotivated.  If you're not dating a lawyer, you must have low-standards.  Or else you are guilty of low self-esteem, upon which case you should visit your shrink because everyone has them anyway.  And don't forget to hit the chain-owned gym afterward.  And bring your Starbucks back to your $gazillion mansion, where you hate your spouse, and your kids are still chilling with their nanny because you simply can't miss the next <i>Oprah</i>.    

I never thought I'd say it but: I am not in love with NoVa.

<b>Faith</b>
While we're on the topic of things I never thought I'd say:  I'm not entirely Catholic.  Not that I spit on my upbringing or denounce the faith of my family, but me - Kristin - I don't think I'm entirely capable of wearing that title anymore.  So what am I, then?  Christian.  Whole-heartedly.  Often I feel like shouting to the world:  I love Jesus!  Ha!  Am I like Falwell's clan down in Lynchburg?  No.  Certainly not in style.  But I am convicted now more than I ever have been in the authenticity of the Christian faith, and of the Triune God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  I don't have all the answers.  And I won't ever have all the answers.  All I can say is that my faith was very 2-dimentional before.  I knew <i>about</i> God.  And now He's 3-dimentional.  He has depth.  Rather than knowing <i>about</i> God, I feel like I actually <i>know</i> God a little.  He has become real to me.  He has proven His presence in my life in countless ways.  And the more I learn in my faith, the closer I grow to Him.  To talk about my faith even under the sectioned-off paragraphs of this entry is contrary to my understanding of it.  Faith is my life's umbrella, in a sense.  It spans over all aspects of my life, and 'governs' each aspect accordingly.  My faith in God, His Son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, is the compass for my life.  All other things are secondary.  As St.Paul said, ""I want to live my life for Christ.""    

The problem:  this is causing an uproar in my family.  I am constantly (and I mean that in the strongest sense) dealing with conflict regarding my faith.  Why?  Because my faith is no longer completely ""Catholic.""  Both of my parents have flipped out on me on more than one occasion, and my brother jabs whenever he can.  They take it as a personal offense.  They hear me speak, but they don't listen.  And on rare occasions, when they are trying to really understand me, they usually completely miss the mark.  Its a vicious frustrating circle of miscommunication.  I feel like half the time I must be speaking in another language.  And then I realize -- I am.  Dad has 50+ years of what he calls ""solid Catholic teaching,"" and Mom sadly lands on the side of whoever has the strongest arguments.  My brother wants so badly to be more like Dad, that he often shuts off his own brain and jumps on whatever Dad says.  Though, to his credit, he honestly likes Matthew, and sticks up for us.  Which brings me to the last (and certainly not least!) ""category.""  :-P      
       
<b>Love Life</b>
This is going to be brief, since I can't entirely talk about this without sounding completely nuts (if you haven't determined that already).  But, I <i>love</i> him.  I'm in love with him.  And he's... well... yeah.  Let's just say that I am completely taken aback by him.  He knows me often better than I know myself, and <i>understands</i> me to my core.  A little unnerving, yes.  Scary even.  But Matthew is the most beautiful thing to have happened to my life.  Its now been about a year since we first started talking.  Things are amazing and beautiful and profound and moving all at once.  I am the luckiest woman alive.  <i>Thank you, Lord.</i>


Needless to say, I am not the same as I was upon graduation.  But despite the difficult issues with my family and my lack of job, <i>I have more joy than I ever have had in my life!</i>  God is truly amazing.  :-)

I'll update about choir and CCD soon.  I don't think I can type anymore right now!"

"event","Can you tell I've been doing more reading lately?  Heh.

In his book <i>Converting the Baptized</i>, Fr. William O'Malley writes about how all too often, Catholics are baptized without having been 'converted.'  He says that we/they are too often victims of unmotivated lethargy; we/they are spiritual couch-potatoes who have supposedly given our/their hearts to Christ, but who fail to manifest the joy that is supposed to bring.  Some interesting moments:

""In the deghettoized, pluralistic society to which we are missioned, one's act of faith in Christ and his Church must be freely and autonomously chosen, or else it cannot survive the assault of so many other powerful and contrary points of view.  One cannont survive a dorm debate at NYU or Berkley with nothing more than an uncritically memorized and accepted catechism of answers.  If born-again Christians have a better chance in that hostile arena, it is not their memorized chapters-and-verses, but the manifest joy and enthusiasm of their lives and their love for Jesus - which we quite obviously have not managed to inject into the hearts of our own young"" (10).   

""If I had childern, I would very much want them to remain Catholics, but if they chose otherwise, I think I'd be willing to settle for their being saints [holy ones].  I think I'd even rather have good human beings than grudging Catholics.  And the choice, after all, however self-impoverishing, would be theirs and not mine"" (8).    Hmmmm....

""It is more important to know God than to know about God.  Surely the Cure of Ars and Joan of Arc are evidence enough of that.  And yet we tell youngsters all about God for twelve years and rarely show ways the youngsters can meet this elusive and, to them, mostly academic 'Subject.'  Then we assume, since the 'Subject' has been explained so often, that the young understand It, accept It, and will remember It.  Such enviable naivete flies directly in the face of every teacher's experience.  Moreover, what adult can still rattle off the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, or the cardinal sins, or any other catechism answers after the first two or three?  Nor did memorizing the catechism daunt Adolf Hitler or James Joyce or Fidel Castro.  What kept us in the Church was not catechism answers; it was felt faith and hope and love - and need.  The answer is not in mere knowledge; the answer is in understanding... let us engage our children in retreats and methods of prayer geared to their receptivities.  It is not primarily club members we are training - or even theologians; it is saints.  Our primary goal is not mere cognition but the transformation of what being human can mean, the opening of horizons, in a word: conversion"" (11,13).

""Futhermore, let us be clear that faith is neither a commitment made after every doubt has been laid to rest nor a commitment without the slightest shred of evidence.  Faith is both calculated and a risk.  Even physics - the 'hardest' of sciences - guarantees only a high degree of probability: trustworthy but not unimprovable.  Faith is not certain knowledge; it is a well-researched bet.  And anyone who makes a bet without some doubt is either brainless or owns the casino"" (15).  


This book is way cool...  more updates to come, I'm sure."

"event","In one of the most hyper-intellectual books I own (meaning, it takes me a good while to understand a paragraph fully), the authors have written the following on the first page:

<b>A Personal Preface</b>
Our compelling reasons for writing this book are three:
1. We are certain that the Christian faith is true.
2. We are only a little less certain that the very best thing we can possibly do for others is to persuade them of this truth, in which there is joy and peace and love incomparible in this world, and infinite and incomprehensible in the next.
3. We are a little less certain, but still confident, that honest reasoning can lead any open-minded person to this very same conclusion.

My favorite part?  

<i>this truth, in which there is joy and peace and love incomparible in this world, and infinite and incomprehensible in the next</i>"

I have the best boy in the world.  :-)

For Valentine's Day, he showed up in a dress-shirt and tie, with five red roses (from the <i>nice</i> florist, I might add).  He took me to P.F. Chang's (he had reservations), and then back to his house for a small cookie-cake.  Then, we exchanged gifts.  

He bought me the DVD of C.S. Lewis' <i>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> (the version I used to watch as a kid, and thought didn't exist anymore), a small angel-bear, and Chanel perfume (""Chance"" -- the fragrance I had been hoping to buy for myself).  All of this was placed in a beautiful wooden basket with white and pink paper grass.  Does this man know me, or what?  

Heehe.... *sigh*

And what, are you wondering, did I give him?

I took the vintage route.  I gave him a tiny silver box with a lock of my hair tucked inside.  And let me just say, <i>yes</i> he loved it.  It wasn't Chanel-perfume-caliber, but I think it went over well.  ;-)"

"event","Am I battling....... <i>depression</i>??  

Maybe a form of.  

I don't feel like myself.  I barely have any motivation for anything.  I crave sleep.  I'm achy and upset.  My back, neck, and shoulders have cramped up so badly that I battle constant headaches.  I've lost my appetite.  My libido is less intense.  I don't feel like talking.  I often feel like crying.

I hate this.  This isn't me!  I'm afraid of this -- this is new to me.  

Is it because I don't have a job?  Is it because I constantly feel guilty about causing my family so much angst?  Is it because my family drives me nuts?  Is it because I'm worried about not having insurance?  Or maybe because I'm afraid I won't have enough money to cover my student loan and an insurance bill?  Is it my faith?  The fact that my faith is causing chaos at home?  The fact that I don't feel like I can call myself <i>Catholic</i> but I can't quite call myself <i>Baptist</i> either?  Am I afraid?  Afraid that I'll cause Dad a heart-attack if I stop worshiping Catholic?  Afraid that he'd be unhappy the rest of his life because of something I've done?  Am I afraid that I might be wrong in all of this?  

I'm scared of the future, and I'm buckling under the present.    

I.... I just don't know what to do.   

Yesterday I attempted to fix things a little.  I went for a run, I stretched for a while, I did my sit-ups.  I took a long hot shower.  Before bed, I even took a muscle relaxer to help my neck and shoulder pain.  But this morning I woke up to find that the pain was still there, and all the medicine made me do was sleep for 12 hours.  So I ran again today.  Took another long hot shower.  Got dressed nicely and went out with Matt.

But all I could think about was this overbearing cloud of muck.  I wanted to be held, but I couldn't handle it when I was.  For the first time, I pushed him away.  And then I really felt awful.  I just wanted to kiss him and tell him I love him, and all that came out was a cry.  I wanted to talk but I couldn't.  I wanted him to be awake and alert, but he wasn't.    

What is wrong with me?  Where is <i>me</i>???  Where is my God? 

(please don't try and answer this stuff... this is all just rhetorical)"

"event","Since I've quit my job at Nordstrom, I've been searching for other jobs that will be able to give me a steady paycheck for doing something that I don't hate.  About a week ago, I came across a job opening for ""Assistant Preschool Principal"" for Chesterbrook Academy (a specialized private school) in Kingstowne.  Cool, I thought.  Sounds perfect:  I'd be working in Education again, but not responsible for daily lesson plans.  I would have an administrative side of the job, most likely 9-5, and something I could leave at work at the end of the day.  No grading papers or planning more lessons at home in the evenings.  And I'd still get to work with kids!  

So, I applied for the job.  Sent in my (fabulous) cover letter, and my updated resume.  Waited.  A few days later, I recieved an email from the Executive Director for Chesterbrook, with an offer for an interview.  WOOHOO!  

Today was the interview.

The good news is, they liked me.  They liked me so much, in fact, that I got another interview with the Principal at the Kingstowne school.  The bad news?

Let's go over the duties involved with this job.  As the Assistant Principal, I would be responsible for <i>everything</i>.  Yes, everything.  As in, if the toilets go on the fritz and the plumber doesn't arrive in time, I'm the one to stand there in my suit and heels with a plunger.  Everything, as in: I'd be responsible for maintaining the school's BUDGET.  Ha!  I'm sorry -- perhaps they should hire an accountant??  I'd be responsible for hiring the teachers (whoa).  I'd be responsible for diciplining the already hired teachers, if needed.  Yeah.  Just a thought, but me, at 23 -- I'm supposed to tell Mrs. Smith, who's been teaching for the past 30 years, how to do her job??  Oh, and let's not forget to mention that I'd be responsible for collecting the payments from the parents (weekly, I might add).  I'd also have to dicipline children (which I knew), and make sure the school is properly stocked with supplies, food, etc.  Ms.Executive Director said that I'd even have to cook in the kitchen sometimes, if they were down a cook.  

Was she serious?

And wait, here's the best part:  the work day isn't 9-5.  It's 6:30-6:30.  I didn't think I heard correctly at first.  But yes.  That's right.  I'd be working 12 hour work days, 5 days a week.  O--K--- so, surely the pay would reflect this, yes?  

Let's compare.  At Nordstrom, my ""annual"" pay (on average, since it was commission) was ~$27,000.  What does Chesterbrook pay its Assistant Principals who do <i>everything</i>???  

$28,000.  

I tried not to laugh/cry.  They have to be joking if they think I'm going to work 12 hour work days, doing all kinds of difficult tasks, and only get paid $28,000.  

So....... thanks, but no thanks.

Back to job hunting.  :-("

"event","I know I haven't truly updated in a while, so here goes.  At least in part (I might not have enough time to write everything right now).

So I'm leaving my job.  Yeah.  I'm officially finished on Saturday night.  

Do I have something else lined up?  No.  Am I nervous about this?  Terribly.  Do I think it is the right decision?  I think/hope so.  

Why, you may ask?  

Many reasons (not in any particular order):  One, the schedule isn't compatible with my lifestyle.  I need a 9-5/M-F if I want to stay sane and still sing and be involved in church(es).  Two, the job isn't compatible with my morals and values.  I feel sleezy telling rich ladies that they need more stuff, and that my paycheck is entirely dependent on how much stuff I convince them they need.  It makes me feel dirty and dishonest.  Three, the job clashes with my faith.  I need to have Sundays off, and retail doesn't accomodate for that.  They hate the fact that I won't come in on Sundays; they've even tried to make me come in on the occasional Sunday evening because ""she doesn't have church <i>all</i> day.""  Ugh.  Four, I need a steady paycheck.  One pay period I made ~$1020.  The next one I made $435.  That's just wrong.  And back to the singing thing -- reason Five:  if I want to still sing with the National Philharmonic, I need a job that will allow for my rehersal and performance times.  Being that rehersals are always ""after work"" hours, and performances are always on Saturdays, the retail world essentially laughs.  Oh, and Reason No.6:  I keep getting kicked off of my insurance policy because I'm not working enough hours (mostly because I have to request time off for National Phil. stuff).  OY.  Reason #7:  It infringes on my slowly developing social life.  As it is, I <i>barely</i> have time to fit in seeing my family <i>and</i> Matt.  Forget hanging out with new girlfriends.  I'm always working when they're off.  And I usually only get to see Matthew late in the evenings, causing him to lose sleep, since he has a regualr job with regular hours (and thus needs to go to sleep before 3AM).  Reason #8:  Most of the customers treat me like POOH.  They act as if the chick behind the counter or on the floor is somehow worth less than they are.  I am treated as if I'm their personal maid, hired to accomadate their every whim and expensive desire.  UGH.

As we can see, this job and I are not getting along.  So.  I'm leaving.

I'm quite nervous about this, though.  While I'm looking forward to a little down time, I know that most of it won't be relaxing, being that I live here with my parents (and often my brother -- we'll get to that).  The plan for employment thus far:  Starting next week I start dilligently hunting for a decent job.  I have my resume in with the Washington Performing Arts Society, so pray on that one, people!  If that doesn't follow through with any leads, I'll temp part-time, while looking for something permanent.  *sigh*  I... I really just hate this.  I feel so damn uncomfortable.  (Pardon).  I even didn't sleep well last night.  That rarely happens.    

All right well... I have to go to work  now (not too many more days left).  I'll continue my update soon."

"event","Taken from the lovely Jamie, of course.  :-)

1. What did you do in 2004 that you'd never done before?

I went to Confession <i>truly</i> sorry, and left with an overwhelming sense of peace.  That chapter of my life (the part I confessed to) is now closed.  Finally.  And I can breathe again.

2. Did you keep your New Year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year?

Hmmm I don't remember what I made a resolution to do... haaha...

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?

No... thank goodness!  Hold that thought for a few years down the line.

4. Did anyone close to you die?

Tom Houser wasn't close to me.  But I did go to high school with him, and we chatted from time to time in classes.  He died while passed out drunk at a party.  His friends didn't notice until he didn't wake up the next morning.

5. What countries did you visit?

None.

6. What would you like to have in 2005 that you lacked in 2004?

A steady, decent-paying, non-boring, 9-5, M-F job.

7. What date from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory, and why:

May 1... Graduation.  Why?  It was a complete mix of emotion, but mostly I knew that from that moment on, my life was going in a completely new direction.  

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?

Forgiving myself, and forgiving Scott.  I never thought I'd be able to do it.

9. What was your biggest failure?

Failing to work out the differences between Katie and I, and letting our friendship end.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?

Thanks be to God, no.

11. What was the best thing you bought?

I bought a lot of cool stuff (Nordstrom discount, man!), but the things that made me feel the best were the gifts I bought at Christmas for the people I don't know.  I realized this year, that in the past when I've bought things for the angel tree, I've bought things cheap -- things I wouldn't wear myself.  This year I realized how <i>awful</i> that is.  Why would I do that?!  Why would I not buy someone something equal to the quality I'd buy for myself??  I felt terrible about this.  So this year, I fixed myself.  I bought all the kids things that were of the same quality I'd buy for me.  I packaged everything up, and wrote out a tiny card for each.  I told them that they were in my prayers, and I wrote out John 3:16.  Merry Christmas, guys.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?

My brother, for deciding to stop drinking (excessively, to get drunk), and for deciding to wait until marriage to have sex.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?

Two Nordstrom theives:  One, who brought her few-day-old infant in, in only a smelly diaper.  Not having a fresh diaper, she proceeded to unwrap the old one (yes in the middle of my dept), wipe the infant with the dirty one, and then strap it back onto the baby.  I thought I would vomit.  I wanted to take the child home with me, and rescue it from its horrible existence.  Theif 2 proceeded to bitch out the assistant manager by screaming (yes, screaming) obscenities and throwing the merchandise at her, since we questioned the legitimacy of her I.D.  

14. Where did most of your money go?

Gas.  Presents.  Party.  

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?

Jesus!  My <i>faith</i> in Him, my growth in the Spirit.

16. What song will always remind you of 2004?

""The Voice of Truth"" by Casting Crowns.  Just heard this one, but it kinda sums it up.  Here's a portion:

<i>Oh what I would do to have 
The kind of faith it takes to climb out of this boat I'm in 
On to the crashing waves 

To step out of my comfort zone 
Into the realm of the unknown where Jesus is 
And He's holding out His hand 

But the waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me 
Reminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed 
The waves they keep on telling me 
Time and time again, ""Boy, You'll never win!"" 
""You'll never win!"" 

But the Voice of Truth tells me a different story 
The Voice of Truth says, ""Do not be afraid!"" 
And the Voice of Truth says, ""This is for My glory"" 
Out of all the voices calling out to me 
I will choose to listen and believe 
The Voice of Truth</i> 

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
i. happier or sadder? Happier!
ii. thinner or fatter? ~ 10lbs thinner.  Yay!
iii. richer or poorer? Richer, but I'm also spending a heck of a lot more...

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?

Running.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?

complaining.

20. Did you fall in love in 2004?

Yes.....

21. How many one-night stands?

Negative!

22. What was your favorite TV program?

Navy N.C.I.S.  The acronym is redundant because its ""Navy Criminal Investigative Service,"" so its like saying Navy Navy Crimninal Investigative Service... oy.  But its a good show!

23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?

I honestly don't hate anyone.

24. What was the best book you read?

I've been reading a lot, and up there was ""Catholic and Christian,"" for its clear, consise but intelligent, 'non-partisan' language.  But I have to say, reading the actual Bible has to be the ""best.""  Yeah I know, I sound like a Liberty-ite.  But honestly, I didn't realize what I was missing.  

25. What was your greatest musical discovery?

The Monteverdi Choir directed by John Eliot Gardiner; but personally, Handel's <i>Messiah</i>.  I never knew how truly amazing it is.

26. What did you want and get?

""Oh Lord, increase my faith..."" --- and He did.  Ask, and you will receive.

27. What was your favorite film of this year?

Denzel's version of <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, <i>Shreck 2</i>, and yeah even <i>King Arthur</i>.  Ok so its favorite(s).

28. How old were you on your birthday, and what did you do?

I turned 23.  Jamie and Matt were here to celebrate, and after cake and presents, we spent the evening philosophizing.  Couldn't have been better!

29. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?

An increase in the receptivity of my Dad and brother, regarding Christianity.

30. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2004?

Tailored, sophisticated, flirty, but increasingly more conservative.  A more modest version of ""city chic.""

31. What kept you sane?

My music; more notably singing with the NP Singers.

32. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?

As a public figure, Pastor Wayne.  His faith is inspiring.  He ""sparkles"" with the Spirit.  

33. What political issue stirred you the most?  

The election.  I was concerned that Kerry might actually have a shot at running the country.

34. Whom did you miss?

Jamie, Tiff, Leia, Andrea, Kathryn, Huszti... the SBC crew, really.  I <i>profoundly</i> miss female camraderie.

35. Who was the best new person you met?

Heehe, Jesus.  And after Him, Matt, and the choir girls -- Carolyn, Jodi, and Camilla; Dave + Sandi, and the PA boys.

36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2004:

That <i>yes</i>, all things are possible with God.  I'm a different person than I was even at graduation.

37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:

I feel... like the floodgates have been swung open.  I <i>rush</i> with emotion; I feel as though my insides are spilling out of me.  

I am <i>profoundly in love</i>.  I can't believe I can even say that!    

And whereas before, I would not let myself go there, now I have let Love's gentle hand caress me into sweet submission.  Ah yes, submission is not always bad!  I would not let myself love him before... but I simply could not continue that way.  A larger force is at work, I believe.  And now, I have found the utmost freedom in the simple act of <i>letting go</i>.  

Do I know what to do with this?  Yes, and no.  I think I know.  But that doesn't take the fear away.  I'm still scared.    

Today Fr.O'Keefe mentioned in his homily that people don't ""fall"" in love -- they ""grow"" in love.  I smiled to myself.  A resounding ""AMEN!!""  I don't think I truly understood that before.  But really, how could I?  I expected an instantaneous pitfall of desire to be followed by a deeper respect for another person.  I thought of it as ""lust, then love.""  And how wrong I was!

I didn't realize that Love is a growing process.  It is a steady, rhythmic, pulsating, and interlocking fugue; no gigantic Romantic symphony, oozing with sloppy kisses.  Why am I surprised that its a fugue?  I hear it in Bach: I hear his Love of our Lord.  But what I didn't know was that Love for another human could (and should) strive for that Perfect Love that God has for us!  

So I see now, that it is not ""lust, then love,"" but rather, just... Love (and its manifestations).  Of course this doesn't assume there isn't passion!  There's an abundance of passion, not to worry!  But its different than pure lust; raw, rot-your-teeth sugar cane.  Rather than a mere reciprocal give-take of physical pleasure, its more of a no-strings-attached gift of physical pleasure, yes, but emotional and spiritual nourishment as well.  Grace, maybe?!  Perhaps that's somewhat warped.  But one thing's for certain -- if desiring him -- and if expressing my love for him is sinful, then I am entirely guilty.  Forgive me(?).  I guess to ask for forgiveness implies that one is sorry for the transgression.  Hmmmm.  Not sure I am there.

I hardly know what to do with myself.  My heart <i>aches</i> without him.  My heart <i>bursts</i> with him.  He both strenthens and weakens me.  I don't feel entirely together when he's not by my side.  

I have never been so in love in my life.

Not that this past week hasn't been enjoyable... its just been soooo busy.  Each 'activity' that I did had beauty and meaning, but I wish I could have savored each thing for longer!!  

Wednesday night I closed at Nordstrom, and then got up at the crack of dawn to pick my brother up from college (yes, 5:15 AM).  Mom and I drove down to get him, and then back up here.  I napped for about an hour (with horribly bad dreams that left me short of breath), and then went to dress rehersal all evening for the Messiah performance.  Friday was spent preparing for my Christmas party, and then performing in the Messiah concert at night.  Saturday was spent preparing for the party some more, and then hostessing the party in the evening.  Sunday was spent up at the Strathmore mansion performing two Christmas concerts with the Singers.  This morning I got up early for a doctors appointment... and now... here I am.  Beat.  But happy.  I shall elaborate on the details of my ""weekend"" of insanity later.

I'm off to lunch with Jamie!!  Yay Jamie!  :-)"

"event","All right.  It feels like I haven't updated in a million years!  

In college, I was updating nearly everyday.  I had stuff to post about -- but perhaps more importantly -- TIME to post it in.  Not that I don't have stuff to post about now.  In fact, I have more than enough to write about.  Perhaps even more than in college.  The problem is time.  Well, shall I say, lack thereof.  

So here it is.  The update.

My ""breakup"" with Matt has been excruciatingly difficult.  Emotions come like waves.  At some points in the day, I'll hurt, but feel like we're doing the right thing.  At other points in the day, the hurt is smaller, and I feel like he and I will be great friends.  Other times I feel like my world has ended.  Often I feel like an infant who was warmly wrapped in fleecy blankets but then stripped naked to be left screaming and shivering out in the cold;  like a part of my heart was just run over by a semi.  I don't understand the ocilation of emotion, really.  Perhaps its a good sign.  A sign that I will someday be able to move on.  

Someday.  Just... maybe not for a while.  

The problem is, most of the time, I don't <i>want</i> to move on.  I mentally know that this decision is best for both he and I.  But my heart is still at war with my brain.  I crave balance; I want peace.  I just don't know how to arrive at it.

Anyhow.

In other news, my job stinks.  Royally.  For about a billion reasons.  The best way to describe my source of discouragement is ""incompatibility"" -- essentially, my life and my job are in constant discord.  

In the summer, it was a fine job.  I didn't have any friends, I didn't have any choirs, I wasn't teaching CCD.  I didn't have anything to do, other than work.  So sure, I could work any and all hours.  But now... well, <i>I have a life</i>.  And I'm not willing to trade it in or compromise it for a stinky job that I have moral issues with.

Yes, moral!  I don't like that my entire job is to convince rich ladies that they need more stuff (that they don't really need).  I don't like that no matter how much I sell, its never good enough.  I'm always supposed to sell <i>more</i>.  Even if I have a fabulously good day for sales, I'm supposed to one-up-it the next day.  No enjoying your accomplishment.  No satisfaction with your good works.  In fact, ""good works"" don't exist in that environment.  Heck, its whatever you can use/say/do to make the sale.  To make more sales.  And then make more more sales.  More More More sales.  More^infinate sales.  (James, did ya like my math reference?!)  Heh.  UGH.  I'm supposed to make people excited about merchandise that I don't find exciting.  I'm supposed to make people <i>want</i> STUFF.  Nevermind if their buying a $2000 coat will strain their marriage.  At least I sold the coat!  Nevermind if they're on the fence and don't really want the suit; I'll make 'em <i>lust</i> for it.  

Its really quite repulsive.  

And the funny thing is, I still love fashion.  I do!  But not like this.  I love fashion for its art.  I love fashion for its attention to detail and fine craftsmanship.  Yes, I bought a $200 pair of Elie Tahari pants (but for $78... breathe, people) because they're exquisitely made.  Its a hobby for me.  My wardrobe is a collection.  But its all an <i>art</i>.  Not a <i>business</i>.  Woe is me for failing to realize the true meaning of ""retail.""  I'm disgusted.  

On top of that, I'm hitting some nasty red tape.  My manager has been giving me Sundays off since I told her that I can't work Sundays due to church and church-related activities (i.e. teaching CCD).  For a while everything has been fine.  She even told me I should fill out a ""Religious Accomidation"" form in HR so that in the off chance that she was moved and I had a new manager, my ""Sundays off"" would be protected.  I thanked her immensely for the tip -- I had no idea such a form existed.  

So I filled it out.  And to be extra sure HR wouldn't touch me with a 10-foot-pole, I threw some ""religious rhetoric"" at them and said that the reason for my accomidation was because as a Catholic Christian, I ""observe Holy the Sabbath day.""  Yeah, I actually said that.  

Well fast forward to two days after I turned in this form.  My manager, Stacey, had a ""talk"" with me.  Apparently, Chris, the head HR lady, called her and was skeptical of my reasoning.  ""She doesn't need <i>all</i> of Sunday, right?""  She said to Stacey.  ""I mean, church isn't <i>all</i> day.  She can work on Sunday nights.  She doesn't need the whole day off.""  

Wow.  So I explained to Stacey that I teach Sunday School at 4-5:15, and that I can't come in, because I wouldn't get to Nordstrom until 6, and that's when the store closes on Sundays.  She looked pained.  ""Well,"" she said to me, ""I mean, if we ever needed you in the future to come in on Sunday, you know, you might need to do that.""  Ummmmm.... hello???  I repeated to her my circumstances, and she just said, ""well, I know.  We haven't needed you on Sundays yet, but I'm just saying just in case, ya know?  I mean... this is your job.  You have to know where your priorities are.""  

Yeah, lady.  I <i>know</i> my priorities.  I'm just sorry they don't involve my crappy job.  

So now I'm in a predicament.... more on that later, as I'm OFF TO WORK...... UGHHHH!!"

"event","I thought that if I wanted something enough, I could simply <i>will it to happen</i>.  

Nevermind the obstacles.  I could do it if I focused enough.

At least I thought so.


Matt and I knew going into this relationship that <i>this</i> was a very real possibility.  I just didn't want it to be.  But like Matt's calling, the more I tried to ignore this, the louder it got.

I thought, ""could I give up Catholicism?""  Well... I tried to, to an extent.  I stepped out of my box and tried something new.  And much to my ""horror,"" I saw God in a Baptist church, too.  So, I thought, ""maybe I <i>can</i> do this...""  And for a while, <i>that</i> bothered me.  So I started to pray, <i>Lord in Heaven, let me be your instrument.  Do with me what you will.  I will go where you tell me to go.</i>  And then... I waited, listening.

My faith grew deeper with Matt's faith, and the more I dug into it, the more meaning my life took on.  My life has literally been transformed, though I can't even begin to comment on all of that now (perhaps in a later entry).

But then a funny thing happened.  I was sitting at Mass a few weeks ago, and it just hit me like a ton of bricks:  This Is Right.  I Am Catholic.  

A large part of me wanted to celebrate -- I know what I need to do now, regarding my faith!  And then a large part of me felt crushed... I knew what the consequences of this would be.

But I didn't say anything about this realization.  I figured I'd try to ignore it.  Why not enjoy the here and now?  Why end something that was truly beautiful?  

Well, my realization got louder.  And Louder.  AND LOUDER.  Until I was crying nearly every evening -- and even then, I was still trying to ignore the fact that <i>I am Catholic</i>.

<i>Why, God??  Why do you do this to me??</i>  

So it built up until this weekend, when even Matt noticed something was wrong with me.  And then we talked.  And this is what we know:

He and I believe that within a marriage, both spouses need to be committed to the same church.  Baptist?  Sure.  Catholic?  Sure.  But its one or the other, not both.  

So.  Since Matt is going to be a Baptist Pastor, <i>I</i> would be the one to have to change if things were to progress.  Thus my spiritual warfare:  could I abandon Catholocism?  

I can't.  

And so that is why he and I can no longer be in a relationship.  What would be the point?  It would be like ""playing house"" -- pretending reality was something other than what it is.  If long-term is not a possibility, then we run the risk of seriously damaging each other emotionally if we continue in a lie.

There is a sense of peace admist all of this too, though.  As odd as that is.  Despite my tears, there is a sense of relief... of knowing that both he and I are following what God wants for us.  And there is joy in that.  

I am in <i>pain</i> over this, but all I can do is trust in God even when I don't fully understand the ""why.""


<i>The Lord says, ""My thoughts are not like your thoughts.  Your ways are not like my ways.  Just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.""  Isaiah 55:8-9

""Come, let's go back to the Lord.  He has hurt us, but he will heal us.  He has wounded us, but he will bandage our wounds... He will come to us like rain, like the spring rain that waters the ground.""  Hosea 6:1-3

""My friends, do not be surprised at the terrible trouble which now comes to test you.  Do not think that something strange is happening to you.  But be happy that you are sharing in Christ's sufferings so that you will be happy and full of joy when Christ comes again in glory.""  1 Peter 4:12-13</i>"

"event","""Indeed many who cling to the theory of the secularist origin of our [American] founding rely heavily on the supposed Deism and even Enlightnment skepticism of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and others.  Aside from Jefferson and Franklin and perhaps a few others, this is demonstrably untrue.  The late scholar M.E. Bradford of the University of Dallas, who studied the religious backgrounds of the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution, concluded that the overwhelming majority of them were strong, practicing Christians.  Bradford found that fifty-two of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration were Trinitarian Christians.  Similarly, of the fifty-five signers of the Constitution, fifty to fifty-two were Orthodox Christians.  As for the denominational affiliations of the signers of the Constitution, twenty-nine were Anglicans, sixteen to eighteen were Calvanists, two were Methodists, two were Lutherans, two were Roman Catholic, one lapsed Quaker and somtimes Anglican, and one was open Diest.  The Diest was Benjamin Franklin, who attended every kind of Christian worship, called for public prayer, and contributed to all denominations.""  David Limbaugh, <i>Persecution</i>

Fascinating.  Now here's where it gets <i>really</i> interesting:

""... pardon, I beseech Thee, my sins, remove them from Thy presence, as far as the east is from the west, and accept of me for the merits of Thy son Jesus Christ... Bless my family, kindred, friends and country, be our God and guide this day and forever for His sake, who lay down in the grave and rose again for us, Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.""   George Washington, in his own handwriting from his twenty-four page personal daily prayer book, <i>The Daily Sacrifice</i>

""I have carefully examined the evidences of the Christian religion, and if I was sitting as a juror upon its authenticity I would unhesitatingly give my verdict in its favor.  I can prove its truth as clearly as any porposition ever submitted to the mind of man.""  and:  ""... natural liberty is a gift of the beneficient Creator, to the whole human race; and that civil liberty is founded in that; and connot be wrested away from any people, without the most manifest violation of justice.""  Alexander Hamilton, one of the authors of the <i>Federalist Papers</i>

and how about James Madison:  ""Religion [is] the basis and foundation of Government.""  and (written in the margins of his personal Bible): ""Believers who are in a State of Grace, have need of the word of God for their Edification and Building up therefore implies a possibility of falling.""

and Thomas Jefferson is interesting as well:  ""I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.""  David Limbaugh writes of Jefferson, ""The consensus seems to be that he was a Diest, but as M. Stanton Evans noted, Jefferson clearly 'believed in the creative, sovereign, and superintending God of Scripture' but also thought that the Platonic doctrine had corrupted the original monotheism of the Bible.  He was probably a Unitarian rather than a Diest"" (310).

and... just look at this:

""... though the founders had access to the works of the great secular thinkers, like Voltaire and Rousseau, they cited them much less frequently and often critically.  The two most highly quoted secular writers were the Frenchman Montesquieu and the Englishman Blackstone.  They were both strong Christians.  Montesquieu's signature work in political science was <i>The Spirit of Laws</i>.  He believed that God is the souce of all law: 'Men make their own laws, but these laws must conform to the eternal laws of God.'  Interestingly he compared Christianity with Islam and concluded that Judeo-Christian theism was better suited to good government.  'A moderate government is most agreeable to the Christian religion,' he said, ""and a despotic government to the Mahommedan.'... Blackstone also believed that all law is derived from God -- the God of the Bible.  'The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the Holy Scriptures... Upon these two foundations, the law of nature and law of [biblical] revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human law should be suffered to contradict these'"" (Limbaugh 313).

"event","Yes, I really do.  I never imagined how much I would gain from teaching a class of fifth graders about Jesus.  I can only pray that they've learned as much from me already as I have from them.

Some examples:

Two weeks ago, I was giving a lesson on Confirmation and how the Holy Spirit works within us.  I explained to the children that the Holy Spirit is the part of our Triune God that wants us to witness our faith.  So we brainstormed on the board ways to witness our faith:  Profess it.  Defend it.  Show it.  Love it.  Know it.  Share it.  And then Ryan raised his hand and said, ""we have to <i>trust</i> our faith too.  We have to trust we're in the right religion.""  I nearly keeeled over.  <i>Yes</i>, Ryan!  Miss Trayer needs to <i>trust</i> her faith more.

The week before that, we learned about the saints.  And the last question on their homework assignmet was ""How can I, a fifth grade student living in Northern Virginia, be more like this saint?""  (they all had to choose one and tell me about him/her).  Again Ryan blew me away.  He answered, ""If I receive a calling, I will follow it.  And I will continuously strive to pray.""  

That <i>CHILD</i>!!  He's amazing.  He just... <i>gets</i> it.    

Keep in mind here, too, that the rest of the class wrote things like, ""I will be nice to people,"" or ""I will give away some of my toys.""  Fifth grade, people... and Ryan tells me he's going to follow Jesus.  Yes, a 10-year-old has managed to completely humble me.

But of course this entry wouldn't be complete unless I shared with you all some of the lighter moments, too:  

In response to the question, ""Tell me a little about your saint,"" one of my two Emilys wrote, ""... and then he became an abbot (i.e. miracle worker).""  Heehe.  I corrected this, of course.  So for those of us who don't know (because I didn't have the proper definition before this, either), an abbot is the head monk over a group of 12 (I think!) or more monks.  Cool.

In response to the ""How can I be more like this saint"" question, the same Emily wrote, ""Well I can't become a hermit monk yet, but I will help people.""  I love it!

In response to that same question, Mary Elizabeth wrote, ""I can be a student of my CCD teacher, and a leadership of myself, and I have a convent in my heart (with nuns and guardian angels in my heart?).""  

I didn't really know what to do with that one.  Haahaha... I suppose having a convent in your heart is better than ""lusting in your heart"" -- so Matt suggested that I save Mary Elizabeth's paper and mail it to her in 10 years. :-P  

So that's it!  I love my class.  Every single last one of those kids.  I'm going to miss them next year!!"

<i>Isn't love grand? It sure is -- in all its many forms -- as you'll gladly attest to right now. Friends, family and significant others will all be especially dear to you now. Show them.</i>

Yes, love <i>is</i> grand.  Even when there's hurdles to get over... love is beautiful.  :-)

Ok so quick updates:

For concerned parties -- the last entry was after I spoke with my brother about my relationship with Matt, and my bro explained to me that he would feel a degree of betrayal if I ever became non-Catholic or ever raised non-Catholic kids.  I tried to explain to him that I had not made any decisions and that I wasn't going to make decisions rashly, but it fell on deaf ears.  He left from his weekend home feeling like I had somehow abandoned him to a degree.  And it killed me.  It still hurts.  

Interestingly, the next day, after praying for direction, I felt a true sense of comfort at my own church.  It felt like home... like a warm cup of coco after playing in the snow.  Its where I want to be.  It is a part of me.

So why did Matt's church feel comfy too??  I just don't know.  Can I have my cake and eat it too?  

This of course, is the source of much of my distress as of late.  Can I keep my religion, and embrace another, as well?  Or does it have to be either/or?  

I just... don't know.  

So what <i>do</i> I know?  I know I love You.  And I know that when I don't get to talk to You, I feel ill.  And I have bad dreams.  And when I do get to talk to You and spend time with You, my world feels at peace.  Yes, even in the midst of this retarded struggle we're having.  So that's that, Sir.

At any rate.

Let's talk about less heavy things for a moment, shall we!?  How about my recent purchase of Handel's <i>Messiah</i> as performed by the English Baroque Soloists and the Monteverdi Choir under John Eliot Gardiner!  Let me just say... <i>yessssss</i>.  It's exquisite.  Its a rather dramatic interpretation for a Baroque piece, but I like it!  Why wouldn't Handel have wanted it that way??  I mean... lets think about the text for a minute here -- of course its dramatic!  Its talking about our Lord!!  The Monteverdi Choir is by far my favorite for rich, authentic, historically accurate (though sometimes with a twist) performances.  I highly HIGHLY recommend this recording.  Its inspiring, really.  I about orgasamed in the car on the way to work listening to it.  Haahaha.  Ok well... maybe not quite, but close.  I did yell out, ""oh MY GOSH!!!"" to myself while in the midst of rush hour.  I wonder what the guy in the lane next to me was thinking.... haaha.

Hmmm more...

Ah yes.  I got my hair done today!  Woo!  It was needing some help.  I deliberated for a while about whether or not to try a new salon, since the one I go to is over at Springfield Mall (a.k.a. the ghetto) and every time I go over there, I fear more for my personal safety.  So on Saturday I went in to Elie Elie, the specialty salon for curly hair, which is right outside of Nordstrom.  I checked out the prices and about cried -- and then had to decide how much my personal saftey is worth, haaha.  So I talked it over with the parentals, to see if they thought the price was outlandish or not.  They insisted that it wasn't (though I still think the prices are nuts), and that I was just going to <i>have</i> to pay that much if I wanted anything outside of the ghetto.  I thought about it, and figured they're probably right.  I mean... unfortunately, up here, prices are insane.  And I'm just going to have to deal with that.  Sure, I could go to a non-specialty salon, but then my hair would look crappy.  (And anyone with culy hair knows that if you go to a crappy salon, your hair comes out stiff and cruchy... ew.)  

So I did it.  I went today and had my hair re-highlighted, washed, cut, and styled.  And holy geez, my hair looks good!  Haahaha.  I'm still not happy about the price, but I can afford it right now, and at least I won't get mugged on the way out.  And hey -- my hair is celebrating right now I think.  I swear its never been so happy.  Mmmmmm sexy hair.  

Random:  I love kids.  I love teaching them and hearing their logic and getting them to think.  I just adore my fifth-graders on Sundays.  And I truly believe that its no accident I'm in there teaching those guys.  I've learned so much from them already.

I think I would like to have four kids.  Yes, four.  I know that's gonna hurt, but seriously.  If I can afford to, I think four would be wonderful.  I'd love a little crew.

Not now, of course.  Haaha.  No babies, please!  I think my schedule is hectic enough... :-P

But yes.  Four.  And I have some names already...  scary, I know.  Just call me Adele Ratignole.  Why is it that I can relate to the ""divine institution of femininity""??  Its beautiful to me.  Not that I can't act like a man sometimes (you should see me eat mom's home-cooking), but in general, I'm a fluffy girly girl.  Not that you all didn't know this.  I'm just rambling, really.  Getting my brain on ""paper,"" if you will.

Ok well that's good for now.  Gotta get some stuff done before my phone date with my Other Half.  :-)"

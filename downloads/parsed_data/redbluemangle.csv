In the opposing corner...
Ant""man"" Drone

for about 20 minutes they eyed eachother and then spider kept tryin to climb up the side of the jar. It couldnt geta grip on the glass. I then instered 1 popsicle stick and the spider rose to new heights! In the meantime the ant plotted ways to escape for somehow benefit the colony. All of a sudden the spider leap down and wrestled with Ant man. Ant man bit one of Spiders legs off! OUCH OUCH OUCHO!! Finally spider sinks its fangs into Ant man head! a minutes later Ant man is napping ina  nice little cacoon. I hope he's ready for dinner!"

"event","Among the tattered dwelling of the new found home, in the furthest cramped corner sat the shell of a goat head strangled in copper wire, scraped of it's insides, unwashed behind the ears, fuming in crooked names spoken in hinges.
To a thinning cowlick's fat his crippled limp, dragging along the hump of the floor. Sobbing from the smacking mouth of the demimonde wells, making wisecracks, spilling from the corners with their pink flinches, second glancing their every move.
It ate pickled nose cartilage that fell from the ceilings, a porkskin drizzle unnerving the humans, while it read aloud from it's favorite books, in glossylalia slang and hierospecks truths, following a slave, patiently, unlocking their hair as it was glued to their upper lip combover.
Under the wall, the shit smeared by faithfully talking the magnum fanatics and their bottles of scalp soup.
They cooked up the tardis smudge on their eyes, a lunar antidote that powdered underneath the oncoming pestilence of their idling fingers.
It wrote them a seance, it penetrated their every dependant desire.
It hacked off the central headpiece of the collective.
It wrote them a message in the marrow of the knife (it might be ""mirror with the knife""), with the extension of (the word sounds like ""back-limit"") transfusion.
Glued to the animals, perversions of their former selves, patiently biting their fingernails looking for a clue.
As soon as it failed to appear, the faithful fell under the spell of public execution.
It had been an eternity filled with useless ritual, all for nothing, promising salvation, but only flags came swarming round for a better taste.
What was left were the scraps, dressed in animal skin, defiled servants holding their breath, fatherless culprits blaming their kin, waiting for an answer.
They thought a day would come, or a draft might choke in midair squeal, some sort of indication.
Only it was the hands of the followers that had left their markings of neatly packed dunes filled with the decapitated remains, found sealed in sand.
It only stained the conscious for a brief moment, then came disgust.
Realizing there was nothing to it, people began collapsing in collective states of drought.
Palm-size vents heaving in the chest, cluttering the graph, a bladder full of remains.
Nothing became of them because nothing was the reason, an apathetic display dripping into vats of obesity.
The feud had been sucking teeth for some time now, but the only baggage that paraded about was the curtain epidermis unfolded in an inebriated suit.
The fit came suffocating, feathering the boa-constricted paleness, frostbitten, and shovel-faced.
It came before them in utter confidence, flares of pink owls in the nest of albino eyelids blinking out chemical obscurities to the blind.
It bloomed into a hemmorrhaged contraption that impopulated the disenchanted, one by one.
All the churches were converted into quarantine facilities, inside them grew bacterial stubble compacted by larvae, contracting and teething.
A newborn litter degradively sufficient, running from the horse collarbone, amongst the murmuring femurs wimpering in fractures.
""Are you the polaroid shot you thought you were?"", it said with a coy smirk.
With the position now vacant, it waltzed right in and made itself at home.
Seduced by the empty nominations at the altar of broken ballot boxes, closer to that nothingness that everyone seemed to embrace.
As it pissed all over them, the sigh of relief steamed off the soaking depressants, an impending sleep was on it's way."

"event","so it turns out i'm living in a crazy world. A world where my feet dont make noise. So anyways I've been getting really annoyed when my dads get home cause he seems so loud walking around the house and stuff. Then i realized that since i've been spending so much time in the basement I've been aclimatized into this whole silent walking thing. So maybe I shouldn't be so anoyed or maybe I should just go upstairs. Other acts/realizations/manifestations of boredom, playing guitar for so long its not healthy, cutting my own hair, over analyzing everything, re-wiring old toys,reading movie scripts, stalking people on the internet, frequent naps and rambling on and on and on endlessly in this post. So anyways Since ""thursday"" is just about done consequently arriving in friday. Its getting pretty close to show time. This show is our biggest yet, its gonna be in front of lots of people i know and respect so hopefully my nerves dont get the better of me. We'ev been crafting out planning assault, practicing our ritual more so then any cult and learning some steps. Chances are if your reading this you'll witness it with your own eyes but maybe not."

a play on words

The shoulders. And down the spine.
The earth pulls it beneath the catafalque

molten rock, magma if you will. It will crystalize

K we were counting my change and then suddenly decided to go to dairy queen. I threw my board at seaguls and forgot about it. At DQ i suddenly realized it but then upon my return it was nowhere to be seen. I'm assuming the seaguls took it because i gave them hard ass raisins. But your guess is as good as mine.Thats ok i was gonna quit anyways. We then decided to go see Alexandras kittens. Julie couldnt come and her cousin already left. So it was just Alexandra and I. We saw the kittens and then looked for somehting to do(i think i'm right on this one A.) Alexandra found a 5 string guitar and I played that deal for a while. Then we just chilled and read mysteries of the unexplained. After that we just talked for hours. Then her mommy came home and I got a ride home. Its safe to say we bonded, seeing as we never really had many conversations prior to now and such. such."

I may post pics later, right now i'm in the contruction phase. Sterile conditions are paramount. As are lighting & humidity. The spores will be kept cool untill i deem the chamber fit. I have thermometer and a heater to maintain a constant temperature i just need to find some steady calibrations to keep the temp at 22- 30 degrees celsius. 26 is the ideal. As for humidity i hope i will have a humididifier soon. As i said before i will have pics soon. I feel like a mycologist."

   Today in careers class we had a job interview simulation. Worth 15 marks. I made it very clear to Mrs. Wlasenko that i don't care in the least. instead of writing open ended questions and well explained answers I didnt. All my questions were very closed ended. They all concerned laser(the job i was applying for was laser technician) and all my answers were about lasers. I can rest assured that when i get my mark tomorrow it will be well below fifty percent, quite possibly twenty percent. Mrs. Wlasenko can eat my ass, careers is bullshit, she knows it, I know it and now you do to.

   At lunch I went to DQ with Rachelle. Twas pleasant. While we were walkin back we almost got hit by cars. That was coolish. Then we walked around the school. Then i went to science class. Now I hate physics, all of it.

Today I might go over to the other Scott i know and play ping pong..yes dear old ping. pongs' just  a vindictive prick though.

enter the wall wall wall captured by integrity your feeling of shame is
searing my soul and beating my curiosity into submission. Tendrils of hate
reaching for reason nothing is left but the wall wall wall. Billy awakens and in his peripheral vision sees johny in a pool of fecal matter. his tendencies prevail and he continues to hinder johny's attempt to aid him. Finally Johny wakes and rouses Billy out of his hazy trance. Johny cant continue like this. somehow they escaped. When Billy finally realized that they had emerged from the hole he was beyond relief. he just acted as though nothing had happened at all. Johny followed his example. so the continued down the path they had originally taken. After seventy seven hours of walking fifty two questions were answered. the last being the most important. Where were they headed? Only Billy knew. And in a bout of rage crossed he finally cracked. While Johny was marching on half asleep billy stayed behind. He bowed his head and inhaled three times, found a large stick and ran after Johny. He caught Johny completely off guard, just as he knew he would. In 2 concussive blows he took Johny's head clean off (clean as in bloody) and in 10 more squashed it into something like stu. Billy tore into this mess with both hands, followed by his face. He feasted on Johny's remains. Billy is now really lame."

"event","uumm. now some reflections. Yesterday I went to the dungeon for the evening with scott. That was cool and shit. Scotts one of my good friends. it a shame he's so addicited to marijuana. I can understand/participate in the odd session with no second thought, but if i were to indulge as he does i would drink bleach and die. That is his choice so i'm done on that topic. At the show i knew many of the people there. I ran into Will (of Killer b's fame) and Hailey from henry was there with some of her friends, some of which i use to skate with. Rachel and julie came. I've dated both(i'ma he skank!?) and am on more or less good terms with. I'm not to sure about rachel tho, she's agreed with me on the point that we dont see eachother as much as we used to but when she came to say hi to me and i tried to hug her she stepped back and gave me some look. I really wish i knew what that means. I think that might just be how she is, being highly conservative?!? Didnt say much to Julie, dont know why. Cant tell if i'm intimidated or just plain standoffish. Hopefully things will unfold and reveal themselves. My highlight of the night was getting my lip cut open in the mosh pit. That was only surpassed by Vicki, i dont know why i odnt hang out with her more often. she is the greatest. Maybe its because my awkward preteen loser personality has withered and died at some unknown point in time or I've just been seemingly blind to it these past years but she is best person i know. And she doesnt even know it. Its kind of ironic for certain reasons that will be left to the reader to deduce or ask me. So about a month ago amanda lowi asked me to go to the aforementioned show so that i could give Jesse(her ex) mean looks. Well first of all I dont like being used in that manner  and second of all I hate how she tries to get my opinion on their situation when i dont know anything about it and dont really care. Anyways, I wanted to see scream blue murder so i went. I get there and amanda is nowhere to be seen.(exactly the opposite of what i was anticipating) and continue on with the evening. I met some very interesting people. Some from anderson that i've seen before and some from other places that i havent seen. overall it was pretty fun. I have to work morning shift tomorrow 8am-4pm.

and now for my story:


Johny said no but billy didnt listen. Now they are both very sorry youngsters. Billy wanted to play in the forest of happyness but johny knew what it would do to his friends face. Billy ran off oblivious to johny's cries of pain and laxatives and frolicked to his faces' content. Ten minutes later billy came out screaming. His face was doing something crazy. when ever he tried to talk all he could say was ""hahaha"". Not the 'hahaha' we all know and love but a 'hahaha' that is evil. its like a record being played at 1/4 speed and backwards if you know what i mean. Johny couldnt help him. He was overcome with his own pains at the moment. Billy passed out....to be continued!"

"event","My brava (touring) bicycle is back to its old pre-fall bike trip self. No rack and smaller tires with higher pressure.

My initial plan was simply to true the wheels, something that hadn't be done since the trip (when I continually had one spoke that would come loose.) In the end the spoke nipples were too rounded off to really true the wheel very well, so with some effort two spokes were replaced! And with Simon's help, I trued up the wheel even though it seemed like the spokes I replaced couldn't get any tighter. (Simon thought to loosen the others, of course.) While the touring tires were off to true the wheel, I switched over to my old normal tires.

It looks good, though the tires somehow look tiny! I debated just keeping the rack on there in case I needed to transport anything large, but I realized it's easy enough to put back on and I always have my bag with me when I'm biking anyway (because my rear lights are attached to it.)"

"event","I forgot to mention that last weekend I regreased the bearings in the front and rear wheels of my touring bike (with Simon's aid). The rear wheel was getting really wobbly during the last week of my trip, and I hadn't fixed it since then because I've been riding my winter bike (and my fixed for a little bit in November.) It's good to know how to do that, and it's my sort of thing since it involves cleaning small bits and pieces (plus green goo). I also put a seat on the poor thing (my fancy seat's on my fixed gear for now, just because it looks so good on a black bike) so it's back in action! And cleaned the chain and cleaned it in general and tightened up the brakes a bit. It looks pretty good, aside from the bar tape (which has faded to being definitely hot pink so maybe it's ok that it's a bit tattered?) Though of course it's been snowy or I've been sick since I did the work, so no recent test rides. I've left the rack on it for now, even the positioning isn't great for the rear brake cable. 

I also cleaned up my winter bike some. The chain was falling off a bunch last Friday night (as it tends to do when it gets dirty), but I think this time it was because the deraileur hanger (which the chain tensioner hangs from) somehow got a little bent. I meant to look into getting a new one this week but this sickness I've barely left the house. (I never get sick like this!) My one trip into Amherst left me nauseous at the top of a not very large hill. Pretty pathetic. However, cleaning the chain has made the bike ridable in the short term.

The fixed gear currently has a flat. Easy enough to fix, so soon enough all three bikes will be in ridable shape! (This seemed particularly exciting last weekend, when it was warm and sunny. Tonight it is snowing again, so I'll probably be on my winter bike mostly, despite the fine conditions of the other bikes.) With this sickness though, I'll just be happy to be riding daily again."

I also got some Native American art stamps and some boring flower stamps (because I didn't want to use the cool stamps I got on bills.) 

It's sleeting out, which was fun to bike in for some reason. Simon's going to get soaked biking home without a front fender. But I enjoyed dashing around in my florescent rain jacket!

I also brought my bike bag in to a cobbler to get some new buckles put on it. Soon I won't have to tie the thing to my body! (I've had trouble with the plastic just snapping in very cold weather, so I finally bought new plastic buckles from an outdoor store.) Sadly I won't have it back until Monday, but when I get it back it will be in such good shape.

This afternoon I went for a walk (on snowshoes) around Wentworth Farm conservation area, which happens to be right around the corner from our new apartment. (I'm curious about the name, because though there are a bunch of fields, there isn't any obvious farm nearby. Perhaps the land used to be owned by someone named Wentworth.) It was a lot of fun and the few people I saw were really friendly. It seems like a nice area. I took some pictures.

"event","I rode my fixed gear bicycle today for the first time in about five months (this summer (where I was in one place and thus not biking at all) plus this fall (where I was riding my touring bike the whole time.)) It was so wonderful. I've really missed it. It felt like I was riding really fast (probably because I was, in comparison to my speed with forty pounds of stuff on the back of my bike.) And though it felt a bit wobbly between my legs as a result, it's also nice to ride to get places (and I don't mean Baton Rouge) again (I was riding to the library.) I realized it was the first time I've ridden in a week too, which is weird. It felt really good, though my elbows and wrists are a bit stiff.

Simon was right. I really did get back just in time for the perfect fall weather. I grabbed my gloves, thinking I'd need them at my racing speed, but no. It's the perfect temperature, where you wear an extra layer and your leg gets a bit chilly where you roll up your pants, but on the whole the air cools you just enough so you don't get sweaty.

As I was dashing down my street, the postman called out ""have a good day Natalie!"" which made me laugh. Close enough! 

Celia and I were convinced that the colors of the leaves were just as amazing in the south, that the whole idea of New England having particularly ""good leaves"" (whatever that meant) was something in our heads or some sort of snobbery. But we left the northeast before the leaves had started to change, so we really had no recent basis of comparison. We realized upon our return that the leaves really are just more brilliant here. Fall is all the more dramatic as a result."

"event","So this weekend I rode in Bike New York's <a href=""http://www.bikenewyork.org/BNY-TOUR.htm"">Five Borough Tour</a>. It's a 42 mile ride with about 30,000 other bicyclists. We drove down Saturday night, did the ride Sunday, and then drove home.

I had a good time. It was pretty interesting and challenging riding with so many other people. There were all sorts of people riding: middle aged people who had dragged their bikes out of the garage, amazing racers with expensive fancy bicycles, hipsters on fixed gears without brakes, kids riding on their own or attached to their parents' bicycles, tandems, hand cycles, recumbants. Since there were so many people riding, the group didn't really split up into fast riders and slower riders. You were constantly passing people and getting passed, so you always had to pay attention in order not to be knocked over. 

We had decent weather. There were a few showers which made the roads a bit slippery and it was somewhat cool. I rode in long sleeves the whole time.

We rode over a bunch of the bridges in New York City (and obviously through all five boroughs.) Mostly, it was incredible how many cyclists there were. My <a href=""http://wintry.gay-robot.com/~kate/kates_pictures/bike_new_york/"">photos</a> are somewhat deceiving because I was only able to take pictures at the rare moments we were in between clumps and the riders were more spread out. Most of the time I was too busy navigating to get a hand free and take a picture.

I'm just excited to have something beneath my hands again. Even if I didn't do a completely perfect job putting the bar tape on (it was my first time), it certainly looks better than the falling down bar tape I had before, with electrical tape holding it together in places. Plus my hands won't get cold in winter on the cold metal! Speaking of electrical tape, I think I'm going to replace the ugly 'profile designs' tape that came with the bar tape up near the stem with plain black electrical tape.

"event","Less than a great day. I went for a good walk this morning and took lots of photographs. Later today, I tried to replace the bottom bracket on my brava. It's stuck, and Simon and I both got pretty frustrated trying to get it out. It's still in there, for now. 

I also cut off the bar tape in preparation for putting on the new bar tape. The new stuff is quite red! But it will be nice to have something proper under my hands again, without all the parts that were falling down the bars and bits scraped off by my falls over the years. 

Mostly I was (or am) stressed about my bike situation, since I'm unable to ride my brava (with its bottom bracket, etc. issues) and the stay for my winter bike is stuck on (I've removed the front fender for some adjustments to the plastic, though that's been temporarily halted because I dremeled my hand the other day (I'm fine. It just looked gross.)) So I just have my trusty pista (which was making a not so trusty sound last night when I was dashing around on it.)

Simon and I tried to race up Williams Street on pistas after having a beer at the Chapter House before I went to work. It wasn't entirely successful, but Simon did quite well. I'd like to try it on my brava. (We also biked up Buffalo some. I've gotten too used to my brava's low gears.)

Also, I had a great ride home from work just now. Dashing down Seneca Street, giving someone directions at the bottom of the hill, and then dashing along Aurora. With the momentum of a fixed gear, it's so tempting not to turn off on to our street. 

I'm not sure why I was obsessive enough to take all these, but:

<lj-cut text=""A bunch of pictures of the removal of the bar tape in action"">

"event","It is very snowy here. I rode my brava up to work, just because of my current light arrangement. There's something I really love about riding a bike with skinny tires in the snow. I know it's silly, since that bike lacks fenders and all the nice snow accessories, but sometimes it feels good. 

I've been getting better and better at biking up Buffalo Street when I go to work. Now I can make it up past the first driveway after Stewart. Getting up to Stewart itself is nearly effortless. (Though this is all on my brava, with its super low gears.) I'm not sure why it's getting easier. I doubt it's the running I've been doing, because I haven't been running uphill much. I doubt it was riding the trainer this winter, because riding the trainer is really nothing compared to riding outside (even though you sweat more.) But last summer it was somewhat difficult to get to our place on DeWitt (about three quarters of the way up) and now getting there isn't bad at all. It's interesting. Exciting to be getting stronger. (I should take a picture of Buffalo sometime.)

The bad news was that my super strong biking up Buffalo caused my lovely cheap generic nashbar women's bicycle seat to rip. I've only had it for a year, but it did cost about $15. The outer nylon covering came off at the front bit, so the bit of foam inside is exposed. I'll replace it eventually, I guess. I'd like a Terry saddle, of course, but they're very expensive. (I like the flames on <a href=""http://www.terrybicycles.com/Saddles/2183100.lasso"">this one</a> and the damselfly on <a href=""http://www.terrybicycles.com/Saddles/2163500.lasso"">this one</a> .) I'll probably just get another nashbar cheap one though.

Biking home from work tonight (at 12:45 or so) was so great. Racing down Buffalo with snow in my face the whole way. Seeing the single track of my skinny tire on the entirely white road. (Feeling a lot more secure biking on the slippery surface than walking on it.)"

"event","So, the chainring on my brava isn't bent, the bottom bracket is just dying. The old one was also apparently not in there straight (hence me thinking the chainring was bent.)(I knew this weeks ago, but didn't post.) Anyway, I ordered a new one (a $20 instead of the $10 one that came with my bike, even!) and it's sitting here on the table ready to install. (My cheap nature of course makes me want to wait until the old one really goes before installing the new one, but that's really not how bottom brackets work at all. And having my bike stop working at an inopportune moment wouldn't be so fun.)

I've been riding my brava anyway, due to the good weather. Today on my ride home I passed a guy going up the hill who said 'perfect biking weather!' in fact. (I see this guy all over Ithaca. He's in his early forties, perhaps. He runs and bikes a lot (generally without a shirt). I'm glad to know he's friendly.) He had a giant waterproof pannier (made out of drybag material) wide open on the side of his bike."

"event","It's good to spend some time working on the <a href=""http://wintry.gay-robot.com/~kate/kates_pictures/bianchitools.jpg"">brava</a>, if only because it suggests spring is on the way. Despite the soap, my hands are still good and dirty. I put the rear brake back on (I'd taken it off last fall to clean because it kept getting stuck, and never bothered to put it back on because the bike was sitting in the trainer all winter). I also tried to adjust the front deraileur. It seems that the chain is still rubbing against something, but not the deraileur. I think perhaps my middle chainring is bent. Also, the whole bottom bracket/chainring portion of my bike moves more than it should. So I'll probably take it to Cayuga tomorrow. 

Even though it was 48F today it felt like 75F. I was going to do an errand and couldn't stand the idea of riding my slowish winter bike, so rode my pista instead (even though it doesn't have a front light right now and I was going out around 5:30PM.) I love that bike, with its sparkly hubs.

"event","So this afternoon Simon and I rode out to the <a href=""http://www.ithacabeer.com/"">Ithaca Beer</a> brewery. It was really warm today (biking in a long sleeve shirt was plenty, without gloves or a hat), probably about 40F. We both rode our pistas. It was so much fun to ride a fixed gear again. I'd really really missed it. Also good to ride a road bike again. Of course the seat felt all low and I wasn't used to my non-woman seat and so on. But that uncomfortableness feels like spring, or something. (Though if it stays this warm for the next two months I'll be both surprised and disappointed.) It also just felt awesome to be able to go fast again, and not start spinning out when you're going what seems impossibly slowly on flat ground. (The gear ratio on my winter bike is great for getting up the hill, but riding around flat downtown ends up being a bit slow.) And that particular feeling of skinny tires! The tracks Simon's tires would leave on the dusty road in front of me! 

The brewery was pretty cool. Everyone was friendly and we tried the stout and the scotch ale. I liked the scotch ale a bunch. We got a growler of their double IPA. The guy at the cash register said he was glad to see us on bikes, and that he loves seeing bikers flying down Buffalo street in the middle of winter.

I'm tempted to ride the pista up to work tonight, but I don't really want to switch my lights over and the quickest way home is straight down Buffalo Street, which is just less fun on a fixed gear."

"event","A few years ago I came across something that was printed on the op-ed page of the New York Times about bicycling in 1972. I read it again today, so I'm mentioning it here. It was written by Nicholas Johnson, who was the FCC commissioner at the time (I believe). My favorite part is:

I ride a bicycle- not because I hate General Motors but haven't the courage to bomb an auto plant.  I don't even do it as a gesture of great stoicism and personal sacrifice... You ride a bicycle because it feels good.  The air feels good on your body; even the rain feels good. The blood starts moving around your body, and pretty soon it gets to your head, and glory be, your head feels good.  

<lj-cut text=""Anyway, the whole longer article is here, if you're really curious:""> 

I ride a bicycle- not because I hate General Motors but haven't the courage to bomb an auto plant.  I don't even do it as a gesture of great stoicism and personal sacrifice. I am not even engaged, necessarily, in an act of political protest over that company's responsibility for most of the air pollution by tonnage in the United States. It's like finally giving up cigarettes. You just wake up one morning and you realize you don't want to start the day with another automobile. Cigarette smoking is not a pleasure, it's a business. In the same way, you finally come to realize that you don't need General Motors, they need you.  They need you to drive their cars for them. You are driving for Detroit and paying them to do it.  Automobiles are just a part of your life that's over, that's all. No hard feelings. You've just moved on to something else. From now on you just use their buses, taxies, and rental cars when they suit your convenience.  You don't keep one for them that you have to house, feed and water, insure and care for.

You ride a bicycle because it feels good.  The air feels good on your body; even the rain feels good. The blood starts moving around your body, and pretty soon it gets to your head, and glory be, your head feels good. You start noticing things you never knew were there. You start whistling nice little original tunes to suit the moment.  Words start getting caught in the web of poetry in your mind. And there's a nice feeling, too, in knowing you're doing a fundamental thing for yourself: transportation. You got a little bit of your life back! And the thing you use is simple, functional, and relatively cheap. You want one that fits you and rides smoothly, but with proper care and a few parts it should last almost forever.  Your satisfaction comes from within you, not from the envy or jealousy of others.  (Although you are entitled to feel a little smug during rush hours, knowing you are also making better time than most of the people in cars.)  

Notice that bicycle riding also has some significant social advantages over the automobile.  Cars unnecessarily kill sixty thousand people every year, permanently maim another one hundred and seventy thousand, and injure three and a half million more.  The automobile accounts for at least 60 percent of the total air pollution in the United States by tonnage- as high as 85 percent in some urban areas- and 91 percent of all carbon monoxide pollution; it creates about nine hundred pounds of pollution for every person every year.  One million acres of land are paved each year; there is now a mile of road for each square mile of land.  The concrete used in our Interstate Highway System would build six sidewalks to the moon.  Even so, everyone is familiar with the clogged streets and parking problems- not to mention the unconscionable rates charged by the parking garages.  Automobile transportation is the largest single consumer of the resources used in our nation's total output of energy.  It is an economic drain on consumers- in no way aided by auto companies that deliberately build bumpers weaker than they were fifty years ago to contribute to an unnecessary bumper repair-bill in excess of one billion dollars annually.

The bicycle is a model citizen, by comparison.  

The bicycle does not kill or maim; it does not pollute; it does not deplete natural resources; it makes no noise; it takes a great deal less space; and it is very much cheaper. (You can buy a brand new bicycle for little more than it takes to operate a car for two weeks.)  Although the bicycle makes a direct assault on four great problems that plague the modern city- traffic, noise, parking and pollution- urban planners have overlooked it in their search for solutions to the urban transportation crisis.  

In perhaps one of the greatest advertising overkills of all time, we Americans are being grossly oversold an automotive product and life style (bigger, faster, sexier cars) that we neither need nor may really want, and that will surely eventually kill us with its exhaust by-products and lethargy- induced heart attacks, if it does not get us first in a crash.  This may serve the corporate profits of the automotive, oil, steel, cement, and road building industries, but it is shortchanging the American people.  

There are other ways to get around."

"event","So I got hit by a car today. My bike's fine and I'm fine. The whole thing was quite scary though. I've never been hit by a car before. February seems to be an unlucky bike month for me (with my broken collarbone last February.)

<lj-cut text=""Too long details of the whole thing:""> 
I was biking along Tower Road, which has non-parallel parking spaces along the side of the road I was on. It's really really hard for cars to see behind them when they're backing out of those spaces. The cars are tightly packed (the spacing is sort of informal; lines spray painted onto gravel.) It's also a fairly busy road. I'm always quite paranoid about watching for cars backing up for that reason, and I often bike a bit in the middle of the road rather than in the bike lane for that section. However, a pickup truck backed up into me just as I was biking past it. I remember putting my hand out as it started, as if somehow I thought by pushing on the car it would roll forwards and not back into me. But of course it didn't and I was knocked down. I was stuck under my bike. Scarily enough, the truck didn't notice it had hit me and kept backing up. I started screaming 'stop stop' (in quite the ridiculous voice; (luckily) I don't think I've ever heard myself scream in fear before. It sounded quite odd though) and pounding on the back of the truck. But he couldn't hear. I was somehow able to get out from under my bike and I ran around to the side of the car waving my hands and shouting. Finally the truck stopped. I ran around to the back of the truck, grabbed my bike, and ran to the side of the road. It's funny how instinctual that is; whenever anything happens to me on a bike, I automatically just get up, grab my bike, and get off the road. I feel like I'd do it even when seriously injured. The guy got out and asked if I was ok, as did a few other people on the sidewalk. He got back into the truck to pull it forward, out of the road. For some reason I was very intent on getting the chain back on my bike. He was in the truck for a while. Then he got out, asked if I was ok again, and handed me a piece of paper with his name and phone number. He said something like call me if you aren't okay or call me if you need anything and then left. He seemed in a hurry but I'm sure it was just panic and so on (or perhaps he was late for a meeting. Who knows.) Some other people on the sidewalk asked if I was ok too, and eventually walked off. 

I'm really glad it was a pickup truck, with such high clearance. It means when he backed up my bike wasn't crushed, just dragged along under the vehicle a bit. 

My bike was fine. The fender snapped off from its stays, but after my meeting I was able to snap it back into place fairly easily. My back light that was mounted on the seat post was smashed to pieces, but it's just a light. The left brake lever was tilted down a bit, but I've been adjusting those a fair amount recently. The grip has a small chunk taken out of it, but that's true of the bar tape on several of my other bikes. Now it fits in, or something. The singulator stood up just fine.

I'm luckily fine as well. I've got an impressive cut on my upper arm (and the whole area feels sore), which is I think where the truck hit me. I think my jacket got stuck on something on the back of the truck, because it has a huge rip in the shoulder. Somehow the jacket's ripped, my arm's cut, but the shirt in between is intact. Weird. I've also got an impressively large, but relatively painless bump and bruise on my shin. And no new rips in my dear brown cartharts, already so worn (ripped) from work and bicycling use. 

I'm a lucky girl. 

I locked up my bike and went in for my meeting. I didn't even notice the ripped jacket until I was walking up the stairs in Fernow. I sat and talked about urban ecology for four hours, then came down to my bike and put the fender back together. I tested it out some in the area next to the bike rack, and it seemed fine. I probably shouldn't have ridden it home, but I did, and the ride was fine. 

I of course feel like there was something I should have done, something I could have noticed, but that probably isn't the case. Life's dangerous, as are cars. Luckily I'm ok."

"event","So tonight Simon and I put on my <a href=""http://www.surlybikes.com/hotmetal/parts_Singlelator.html"">Surly Singulator</a>. I thought of buying one back when I was putting my winter bike together, but I couldn't justify the $50 cost when an old deraileur would work just as well. (Either of them can be used to keep the chain tensioned.) However, someone on the icebike list was selling a used singulator for $20, so I bought it. I've been having some trouble this winter because whenever my chain gets dirty enough (which happens quickly with all the snow and salt) the chain sticks in the deraileur and so it makes an awful clanking noise, particularly when biking uphill. It's all solved when I clean my chain and more importantly clean the deraileur cogs of all their grime. Hopefully I won't have this problem with the singulator, with its single cog and that cog's slender form. 

(It's also sort of cool because the black singulator matches my frame better than the chunky grey deraileur (though the deraileur served me quite well.) Also, the singulator's cog is green.)

It's been snowing and icing since around 10 this morning, but because it's so crazily warm (high 20s! Low 30s!) it's mostly ended up as slush on the roads. So you get excitingly very wet. 

We took a little used road for the last block of our ride there. Lots of good sliding. (I still haven't gotten the Nokian 106s.) On the way home, mostly just splashing through big puddles. I love fenders.

"event","So the winter bicycle has been working pretty well. I cleaned it today and it looks beautiful. No more salt and sand and so on. Simon rode it the other night and liked it, which was nice. (Though the next day he rode it again and complained about the chain line. I'm thinking of moving the sprocket on the back over a bit.) 

<lj-cut text=""Rambling about current winter bike thoughts:""> 

A few weeks ago I used the dremel to cut the notches in the fenders for the brakes a bit larger. The front brakes were sticking a bit, in part because the fender was in the way. The way I have it set up, in the front the brakes go under the fender and in the back the brakes go above it (there's no way to get the fender on under them.) Anyway, I love the dremel. Quite easy to use. 

I also had an odd problem where the brakes became rather ineffective. It seems like the brake cables just shifted, somehow, so there was half a centimeter more brake cable than I wanted. Anyway, I moved the cables and retoed the brake pads and all is well. 

I really like the two sided pedals. Not that I ride the bike in normal shoes much. But I like that I could and someone without bike shoes could borrow it.

The LED I have in front has stopped working. I thought it was just the batteries, but no. I'm thinking of getting a light like Simon's, though I don't think I want to be so dorky as to have it <a href=""http://wintry.gay-robot.com/~kate/kates_pictures/simon_helmet/"">helmet-mounted</a> (plus it makes your helmet heavy and oddly balanced, though I'm sure I'd get used to that.) My plan (back when I just that my LED's batteries were dead) was to wait until I got another job, but it's important to have a working front light, so I might go get one today. I think I can find some way to mount the light to my bike, and ziptie or velcro the light stick portion of the light (the battery) to the frame. I'm a lot happier biking at night with a good light, also. And I do really like biking at night. (Last night we went out to rent a movie and so on, and it was a lot of fun dashing around at high speeds in the relatively cold air (even if my chain needed cleaning and sans light.))

I'm also saving up for some studded tires. Probably the <a href=""http://www.nokiantyres.fi/bike/images/w106.jpg"">Nokian Hakkapeliitta</a> <a href=""http://users.rcn.com/icebike/Equipment/nokian106.htm"">W106s</a> that Simon bought a pair of used last summer. It's really amazing what a difference they make. Loud on pavement, but awesome on ice and snow.

In other bike related news, I put new insoles in my poor, cheap, falling apart bike shoes. It seems to make them a bit more comfortable (at least for trainer-riding.) I don't really notice a difference for my grocery trips. I also replaced the laces (yes, bike shoes with laces. They were the cheapest ones I could get when I bought my brava, and I'd spent most of my money on that bike.) Hopefully I'll be able to afford new shoes this spring."

I also figured out a reason I might have had so much trouble with the chainring bolts the other night. One of them had a metal spur sticking out of the side so it wouldn't seat right. I didn't notice it the other night, so maybe that was what gave me so much trouble. Or I just don't do things well once I get frustrated.

Also, putting on the primer means I can't put the bike together until the primer is dry. Oh well. It says it's dry to the touch in two to four hours!"

They were able to get my rear brake on my brava working again just be squirting tons of degreaser in there and also (I think more importantly) using their air compressor thing to squirt air in it and get all the junk out as well. So after squeezing it a bunch it's as smooth as can be. Just need to put it on. 

Also, though they couldn't find a new lockring that would fit my wheel, they found a used one that they cleaned for me and seems to fit. It's white and has a little sun on it (the brand is sunrace). 

I also got some more lube and two tubes for the winter bike. And put the primer on so the scuffed parts can be purple.

It's made worse by the fact that I took apart the brakes on my brava because they were sticking. Now one screw is stuck in there and so I can't even put the whole thing back together (never mind whether the brake itself would work or not). So I have to go into Cayuga with a taken apart brake to get it fixed. I feel dumb. Woe.

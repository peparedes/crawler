"event","<p><font size=""4"">Total defence day,is a day when all students have to&nbsp; sacrifice their recess.They only can have a bun and a bottle of NEWATER.<br /><br />When in class all the fans have to be switch off it was such a hot day but the teachers insisted that all the fans must be switch off.we also practice fire drills the alarm will suddenly be activated and we have to quickly line up outside the class and go to the parade square to line up.we alo need not to bring anything down as it will be very difficult for all the students and teachers.At the parade square our form teacher will take down our attendance to see if everybody is present.<br /><br />After a long day at school it finally end ahh it was such a relive becauce we could finally go home and switch on the fan!! but the overall feeling on Total Defence Day was fun as we get to experince the day when war started.<br /><br /><br /></font></p>"

"event","i have now realized that sacrificing my work time for a fully loaded weekend of beligerence has royally fucked the chance of getting any kind of nights rest for me and many other dorm mates since finals begin tomorrow...but that is okay because it was all worth it.  i found out this weekend that me and a friend of mine have a keen skill of hustling chumps in beer pong.....it was awesome, we entered a 12 team, double-elimination tournament for a cash prize, and WE WON!  we beat the house team, and they were so pissed off.....we later celebrated with 40s and waffle house...well enough of this brief spare time, got to work"

"event","i am really disappointed that i missed the second go around of the best band get together on this side of the mississippi, however, there is a perfectly excusable explaination, this is the seventh annual film festival that the city of savannah hosts.  it kicked off last night with the presentation of the life time achievement award of actress kathleen turner (loved her in ""peggy sue got married"" and as the voice of jessica rabbit in ""who framed roger rabbit"")  following this presentation/speech is the showing of ""sideways"" directed by the master of dark comedy, alexander payne(""about schmidt,""and ""election"") and starring paul giamatti.  it is a very entertaining film that makes you make to drink an ass load of wine, which inspired us to do so following the showing, i am kinda feeling the downside of it right at this moment.  oh well, the festival goes on until next saturday and i have tickets to everything, including ""dandelion"" which is showing in thirty minutes so i am out......i just can't wait until saturday, when johnny depp and roger ebert make an appearance."

"event","last night was like in other night here in savannah...dinner at 6:00....homework at 7:00.....skateboarding intermission around 9:30.  the skate spot of the night was at a church off of Abercorn where all the other skate rats convene.  everything was going according to plan until a 6-stair claimed a piece of my ankle.....yes, i rolled the hell out of my ankle and it hurt like a bastard.  after attempting to walk it off, i decided that i best sit down and scope out the damage.  already having the ugliest feet this side of the mississippi, i now had a 2nd ankle on my right foot...purple and the size of an egg.  my friends and i were hoping it was just terribly sprained, but after an hour of not being able to stand due to the agonizing pain......we thought it best that i just see a doctor.  upon my arrival to the hospital i noticed that there was a surprising amount of people present. i mean you would have thought that the first 100 people hurt or sick got a free pair of Air Jordan Spinnas'.  well..... while in the waiting i come in contact with this tall, lanky, middle-aged, black man, who had the face of mr. ed (the horse of course),  and due to the 11pm rush hour, i got trapped into talking to this man for an hour and a half.  he lectured me about everything: weapons, drugs, politics, jobs, money, safety, sex....i mean the list goes on and on, and the majority of these lectures were in sentence fragments.  i felt like charlie being hammered about philosophy by cam but by someone with a first grade reading level.  all i could do was nod my head and pray for the nurse to hurry up and call my name.  the highlight of all these rambles was the proverbial ""sex talk.""  although difficult to understand, the message came clear with his hand gestures.  right as a female nurse was walking by, he was demonstrated how to properly finger a girl's behind by rotating his index finger around and around, thrusting it forward several times.  i seriously wanted to crawl underneath my chair.  i finally get called, take a few x-rays, and find out that nothing is broken, however, i might have potentially torn a ligament, which sucks balls.  basically i have to stay off of it by means of crutches for the next week or so."

"event","it seems that sakura was not the only one that shared fire in their eyes for ol ""camcakes"" as they call him.  chalie's blood began to boil as well while enduring a 30 minute lecture on philosophy, given by cam, to which charlie's only response was ""please shut the f--- up! any night but tonight!""  donnie made it out just in time to miss the 45 minute check anticipation, and the 30 minute ""i think we should just go to surin west next time"" conversation.  all in all it was a good time, especially when the bowling lanes got to experience cam's fashion statement of bowling shirtless."

"event","dang its been a while since ive done LJ. i didnt know i havent written since like the 1st week of school lol. o well, the past couple of weeks have been great, ive been really busy with cross country at 6:15 then school, then soccer class at 3:05 then cross country afterwards till about 5:30 then soccer practice on tuesdays and thursdays from 6-8. so ya, ive barely had any time for anything, ive been trying to see val, which i did like 2 weekends ago now, when we had a bar-b-q. then this weekend  i had laborday tourney(soccer) from saturday-monday(today) the only reason we didnt come back on sunday was cuz we won every game by a lot. 1st game was 3-0 2nd was 4-2 third was 1-0 and we had finals against a division 1 team(highest level of playing) and lost 4-1:\ but we still got a trophie/cup thing about the same size as the 1st place trophie lol. and ya i just got back and im friggin tired...my face is burnt to hell. and ya i got kicked in the nuts 2x and in the chin 1x, leaving an internal bruise thingy, its like a bruise but red instead of purple. and thats about it.
lataz

I want to see vallllllllllll!!!!!"

"event","lets see if i remember all of my periods...lol. ok here i go...well 1st of all before i go into 1st period i saw val this morning and after school and thats about it..:\ but w/e we'll find a way to see eachother more:P 

[1st period: Ready Set Teach!]
Yes i want to be a teacher...preferably math(not geometry) or a soccer trainer/coach. and my best bud sits right behind me in that class NATHAN!!! haha he's a character, nonstop laughing in that class. the teacher is really funny, she is down to earth and most likely am gunna get 100's in that class if i get rid of my stage freight lol cuz we're supposed to teach at the elementry throughout the class.

[2nd Period: Mr Rubak and his ""box"" (pre-ap precal)]
this class is gunna be hella hard but at the same time its gunna be hella fun, cuz mr rubak is a character, he does some funny stuff for an old man. and he has this homework box with a lock on it...who knows y lol.  except for people not to cheat off of u.

[3rd Period: Webmastering with mrs. greer]
mrs greer is definitely the most leaniant teacher in the school. and she has some funny stuff on her computer, like this guy that bashes the keyboard and kicks his computer monitor off his desk. and she's like ""if u ever get this mad, please dont take it out on the computer..."" it was great. and she had lots of clips of that 1 guy that fixes computers on SNL. ive seen all of the 1's she showed us, and i was cracking up the whole time cuz i knew what he was saying with all that computer talk. o ya nate sits next to me in that class too lol. so that class is gunna be another hella fun class.

[4th Period: Physics]
Wasnt in there long enough to find out much*cough skipping*, except my buddy amba tucka! is in there, lol.

[5th Period: US History]
This will be the only classs ill hate, mrs. ehman is a bitch!! like hardcore, she tries to be all ""proper"" and wont even say yall...that ""you all"" was getting SUPER annoying, which means i wouldnt be able to live in the north haha. and she said she was gunna give us more homework than the ap history class, i was like wtf??!?!! this isnt fucking college damn. she said we'd be doing like 4-5 page essays on like the presidential election...im like wtf?!? i wish i was in chapmans for history, he'd let me slide alot..plays favorites with the soccer pros:D lol

[6th Period: English 3]
mrs. a is the shiet, and i have brandon julie and zach in that class...its gunna be hella fun. and i slept through half the lecture so i got my ""nap of the day"" as zach put it(he was sleepin too) and then...
[7th Period: Soccer]
now chappy is getting kewler, he's not an asshole yet, but lets hope that wont ever come up, and i still dont have my physical so im screwed, hes pissed at me lol. and  my old soccer buddy that i competed with for my position came back from spain. havent seen him in like 3 years. so i hope he's progressed...we need him lol. and we got some swiss dood which is awesome, and like 3 other varsity players from other schools so its gunna be awesome this year. And hmm thats it soccer is gunna be crappy cuz of all the running.
*afterschool* well i saw val in the gym, and i walked behind her for like 2 or 3 minutes before i was like ""Dang val u walk fast"" and she's like ooo there u r! lol. it was funny:P
thats my dayyyyy it was awesome overall till mrs ehmans class, then i felt the school feeling sinking in lol."

"event","welll before i go on about school i rather talk about my wonderful weekend! HOLLA! haha. well at 1st i went to beckz bday party(the redhead) and it was alright, got to chill with my friends, get to see every1 again and stuff. and we got into a cake fight cuz we had 3 cakes to waste lol. and everytime i got the remote i changed it to chnnl 401!! haha (soccer chnnl for every1 who doesnt know) and ya lol i was annoying every1 but the guys. and then hmm...i listened to cute without an e like 4x in a row, and i was like man...where's val, i wanna see her(at that point i hadnt seen her for like a week and was all lonely:\ ) and then after all that we went out and played socccer in the street and just did stupid stuff. and then me and martin decided we were gunna go to the beach the next day(Saturday) and that was awesome. me martin ja and val of course. and me and martin went surfin while the ladies laid on the camper of martin's truck. and when we went surfing it was soo hard to get out there but sooo worth it. that day was a day i wish i had a short board to get out there more ezily(duck dive:P) and it'd be ezier to ride the waves too. and then the whole time i was surfing i was like drift faster so i can go in and see val. which is amazing cuz i rarely give up surfing or soccer for some1 lol. but val is special. so when we went in and the gurls were hiding in the camper and ja was screaming cuz some mexican doods were hitting on em, like 35 year old guys. i laughed and so did val and ja was like all freakin out lol. i thought it was hilarious. but yaa we hung out with the girls for like 5 minutes while waiting for our arms to stop feeling all weird from surfing for a while. and then the girls finally wanted to go surfing. and the funny thing was, they wanted to see us surf first lol. and i made a fool of myself like 3x, then when i finally caught 1 every1 was looking somewhere else lol. but w/e, showing off doesnt get u very far in life lol. except ur ego. :P Well after a while of doing that we let the girls surf, and val wasnt too bad, better than any girl ive seen as a 1st time surfer, she almost stood up lol. i give her brownie points for getting up after the wave was done and trying to stand up, it was so cute!! haha. well after watching them surf better than us, we went to my house and hung out, and they ate all my food lol. but w/e. and then we went to vals house to go swimming which went very well, got to be all romantic lol. and martin was skinny dipping and chasing people around  he's such a goober lol. and then i spent the nite at martins, then we woke up and ate then went back to vals to go swimming again. her mom is hilarious but she makes me feel all weird when im around val...im usually not like that around parents, im normally all comfortable, i guess its cuz im afraid of her not liking me or something. that and val kept looking around everytime we kissed lol. and her brother is the kewlest, he's not annoying...yet lol. only downfall about the family is...baseball...lol but thats about it, other than that her family is hilarious as hell, especially when they're fighting over this tree that they're neighbor has. and then we went to soccer practice. and that ended my day. then school today woo hoo!!*not* read on 2nd lj entry:P



to be continued....
THE END! lol

Well the only interesting day was yesterday when i hung out with val martin and ja, it was sooo much fun. my summer keeps getting better and better lol. We got to help ja pack for dallas, and i think we only had 1 sad moment the whole time of packing, and thats when martin wrote on the back of the picture. which was pretty cute lol. and every1 was having lil secrets and i was like pushed off to the side to load stuff up!! i felt soo left out lol j/p j/p. 1st martin and ja talk and then val and ja talk, iwas like this cant be good, i tihnk it was just about her staying here for ANOTHER 2 MONTHS WOOO HOO!! YEAY!!! get to know her a lil better and maybe become part of the ""trio"" to make it a ""cuadro"" lol. but im sure martin is estatic about her staying for another 2 months, i know val and ja r definitely like OMG OMG OMG !!! YEAA!!! lol. and omg ja's mom is so awesome. she gave us each like a gallon of gatorade, and when she was going to get em she asked if any1 else wanted 1, and of course martin had to make a joke of it and he was like ""ya i'd like 4 double cheese burgers and and..."" and she was like o ok r u hungry? martin was like umm noo...lol and then he was like i was j/p. so she's like o and then leaves. well after clearing out the living room she comes back with a gallon of gatorade for each of us and 4 double burgers for each of the guys and 2 for each of the girls. i was like...wow, she's awesome lol.

"event","i love this song, so i thought i'd share it with the rest.
(for more dashboard songs just ask me...i know em all)

Hands Down

Breathe in for luck breathe in so deep this air is blessed you share with me this night is wild so calm and dull these hearts they race from self control your legs are smooth as they graze mine we're doing fine we're doing nothing at all. 

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst or break or bury or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer. The words are hushed lets not get busted, just lay entwined here undiscovered. Safe from the earth and all the stupid questions.. ""hey did you get some?"" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear, so we can get some. 

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst or break or bury or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer. Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and the walk that we shared together. The street was wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it and let you in and you stood at the door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me, but you meant it and I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it."

"event","Well this is officially the 1st time writing in the journal about something interesting lol. 3 days ago...i met this girl...today i am with her...and i am happier with her than any girl i have ever been with. We met at my friend(martin)'s g/f(ja)'s house. It was kinda awkward how we met, cuz she was kinda wasted before she started opening up and talking to me more. but the funniest thing was when she was like im not gunna kiss aaron...omg i have a b/f and all this stuff, even tho she hasnt seen him for 3 weeks and hasnt talked to him. That and he's in dallas and we're in corpus...so thats a long ways away. then she finally kissed me when i was leaning up against the wall next to martin and ja making out, so i guess that made val make out with me...lol. i felt kinda bad cuz i wasnt sure if she was just drunk or if she was like wanting to. But she remembers everything she did with me...just not anything around it. she remembers me kissing and remembers the kiss and said i was good:-D so that was a big ego booster lol. and then the next day we started talking and i started to like her more and more...i cant find anything wrong with her...she's just too good to be true. she loves my music(which normally no1 does) and she believes in the same thing as me(which no1 else does) and that was like a BIG boost up, cuz ive always wanted to share how i feel about religion to some1 taht doesnt go all Christian on me and try to make me be saved by jesus. And over all of that she is just the kewlest person to talk to. and after talking to her that nite after the party...everything went really really slow...like the day felt like forever...like everything went slow till i met her again at the bonfire...i mean the hour before the bonfire was the longest hour of my life...its like waiting in a waiting room to go to the doctors lol. And she already meant so much to me even tho i knew her for like...2 days...but now 3...its like ive been dating her for a month. but its only been a few hours, but the 3 days felt like dating but doesnt count:-D . She is the sweetest thing, i thought i'd never meet a girl thats as romantic as i could dream, but i think she just hit that spot. Talking about hitting spots...she filled every space in my life that needed filling, amazing what a person can do in so little time. but ya...about the bonfire, it was awesome. I..ME!! ACTUALLY BROKE THE ICE OF SHYNESS! its always been the other way around...cuz im the shyest guy in the world when it comes to that, but something gave me that extra push to make the 1st move, and im glad i did, or i wouldve considered myself a loser lol. and unaccomplished once again lol. but for the 1st time i took the initiative and that is 1 of the things that no1 else could understand  how much of a step taht was for me, lol. i have never ever been this comfortable in my life, i feel like i can just be myself and have no worries about her hating me or not, cuz she actually likes everything about me and feels the same way as i do her. its like she is my 1st real girlfriend..or maybe she is the 1st person ive ever liked more than anything else...again i dont wanna use love because that word is waayyy strong, but i am almost comfortable about saying it, because im like obsessed with this girl...i mean typing this much about a girl is unheard of from me, unless maybe i was making it up or something, but this stuff is from deep down lol. *beats chest and throws peace sign* fo show:P hot dingaling bling-bling. lol but ya...this is the beginning of a great life...and the ending to the empty spots. lol man im such a sucker for luv lol. gnite my journal...
luv
aaron:P"

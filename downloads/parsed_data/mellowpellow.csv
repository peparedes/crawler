"event","So things lately have been going pretty well, in a way. Emotion wise at least. Still job hunting but i'll get through it before i know it. Getting my GED is still in process. Slacking big time on that but yea that'll get done sooner or later. Rather sooner but w/e. The whole friends situation is going pretty good, i know who i can trust and who i should be friends with and who i should just speak to but not become good friends with. Or become friends with again. Lately i've been dealing with two losers who like to prank call and give me bullshit just because they dont like my BF and just because their jealous. But w/e...childs...thats all they are. Other then that i think this year is going to be good. Didn't think so at least, last year was crazy, middle to the end was a big depression stage for me. Glad thats over with...very glad. Other then that im pretty happy with the way things are going, sure they're not perfect or going exactly how i want them to, things aren't the best but at least im happy. Things will pull through sooner or later.
Not to be negative but im sure things will go back downhill at some point, i dont believe in bliss, or at least i dont believe in the fact that bliss last a lifetime, i dont think complete happiness exist. It does but doesn't. Life is a rollercoaster and theres always gonna be its up and it's downs...so be it...brush it off...forget or learn, n then just continue with everything.
My dad and me are finally doing good with the whole speaking to each other. I dont feel like im the only one communicating. I still feel like im always the one to call him but he returns my calls if he doesn't answer so thats good. He's out of state a lot now with his new job, so we make a point ot have lunch or dinner together when he's back in town."

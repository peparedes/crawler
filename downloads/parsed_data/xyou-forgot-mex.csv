"event","Well, today has been weird. First I had a dream that I bought a puppy but then it ran away. So, we went looking for it and found it dead in a random room wrapped in a cloth in the arms of a jesus statue. So I ran all the way back home and started sobbing and screaming and woke up crying . . . weird, I know  . . .  and then some personal stuff happened that I shan't speak about . . . I can only tell the people who are closest to me . . . and you all know who you are. 

Other than all the bad stuff that's happened . . . I've been okay. I'm watching spongebob right now and trying to recover . . .  slowly. I think I'm going to watch a movie to try and brighten my day :/ But the good thing is . . . the sun has come out . . . randomly . . . and the pureness of the sun makes me want to cry.

On the news I heard that this mother left her 7 month old baby home alone while she went to the store. The mother forgot and left the stove on . . . so her apartment caught on fire and the smoke smothered the little baby girl and she died shortly after the paramedics got there. . . I started to cry when I heard this. It's not fair that a little baby should die, she never got to see her first birthday . . . It's just not fair . . . she . ..  should have lived until 80 or something . . . so she could see the world . . . and all it contains 

Lol, so basically I've had a sappy day and I've been crying a lot because of what happened that i won't speak of because i have more dignity than that . . . so bye bye for now

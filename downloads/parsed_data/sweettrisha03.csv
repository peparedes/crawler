WHO DOES THAT? i believe i say on the video ""if thats not gay i dunno what is"" which was followed by katy saying ""ur pubes smell"" because yes, cody lit that on fire too. shortly after that kyle disappeared.... and then he comes charging outta the house in cody's cheerleader uniform.&nbsp;weird right? lol well it was funny as hell watchin kyle trying to do a round off&nbsp;back handspring.... lol he stopped after the round off and ended up kneeing himself in the&nbsp;eye when he tried the&nbsp;back handspring. lol but me n cody did have him stunting lol like a ""real"" cheerleader.&nbsp;Cody helped him put me up in a chair. and what did kyle say right after all this shit?!&nbsp; he said, and i quote <FONT size=4>""damn cheerleading isn't easy""</FONT> THATS&nbsp;RIGHT-- remember that shit!&nbsp;&nbsp;lol ok so u think the random shit that these boys do would be over right? ugh... or not. kyle goes to change outta the cheerleading uniform, and he comes walking into the living room with his t-shirt on, and his boxers around his ankles, with a outburst box in front of his dick screaming look i'm having an outburst! lol he's walkin around n all we be seein is his tiny white ass. lol that is till cody took a picture of katy with her face right by the outburst box... that kyle happened to lift up when cody took the picture so we have a picture of kyles balls in katy's face. lol too fuckin funny. sometimes i dunno bout that boy! i tried to come home early lastnight cuz i needed to study for my american literature test that i had today, that i failed thanx to kyle cuz he wouldnt let me leave.... lol kidding babe.... i dunno what i wanna do tonight!!!!!! shelly n katy n brittney are going to u of i but i dunno if i wanna go or not hm..... i dunno i'll prolly end up going to streator or some shit with sarah. who knows :)

U GUYS SUCK! lol anyway! i dunno basically i've just been with my girls, usually with the streator boys. always good times. we hung out with c-shady a couple times last week.... who thinks he slick n can run game on 2 good friends... lol i told u buddy game recognize game! it was a good try though! i dont think i ever laugh as hard as i do when it's me sarah n cal for real. ummmmmmmmmmm we had a hot tub night last week! havent done that in FOREVER!!!!! good times :) lol that night i guess i was mad at kyle, lol no reason really, just bitching to be bitching (who me? no...) lol n only in my fucked up world can i be fighting somebody n then be calling him my boyfriend by the end of it. but everythings great! lol lastnight was like the most fucked up night we've had in a lonnnnnnnnnnng time! i worked n had a HORRIBLE night there. it'd be easier to list the things that went right, rather than the things that went wrong. whatever. so i was crabby but ya know it happens. i went to streator when i got done, and then later we came back to lasalle to the guys house. it was actually a pretty good time! but of course it always is :) ummm there was like random drama here n there but pretty much it'd be a deal for like 5 min then be dropped. lol somehow there was like a 20 person brawl in the living room. not quite sure how that happened.... lol interesting.... after that alot of people left, n we all were just chillin. then people started talkin shit again, lol after that shit just went crazy again. more fighting, but this time i was involved (cuz we all knew that was gonna happen sooner or later) then the cops came, it was a mess. lol then these random text messages?????? i still didnt get a response to the last one i sent by the way! so after the cops let us go i took kyle back to streator then came home n chilled till like 5 this morning before i finally fell asleep so im SOOOOOOOOO tired right now! i gotta go to this draw-down thing with my mom tonight n then who knows what were doing.&nbsp;theres parties i guess, but i wanna just chill. i think me n sarah are gonna see kyle n donny, but&nbsp;who knows. &nbsp;Prolly gonna end up staying at shelly's !!!! lol gotta LOVE those nights!!!!!! haha i LOVE my girls :) </P>"

"event","<P>ok so i never update anymore. Yet i still have a handful of people who check my journal like 5 times a day.... creepy!!!!! whats creepier is i dont even know some of the screen names..... i wonder what these people would do if i deleted my live journal? i never realized i was THAT interesting.&nbsp;anyways....</P>
<P>There hasnt really me all that much thats happened lately. ummmm i found out that im prolly failing outta IV... lol who does that? i didnt think it was possible... but suprise! lol so right now im working my ass off to catch up in my classes. and im trying to wake my ass up in the mornings to attend class. so far im doing ok.... lastnight i came home from work at 730 and actually stayed home all night and worked on my Robert Frost paper. i got most of it done, but i had to get some more resources from the libraray, so i got up early this morning to do that... i finished it!!!!!! i get all excited and then i find out that class is cancelled. DUH!</P>
<P>other than that after all the bullshit last weekend, things did eventually work out pretty well. actually things are great! friday night me n my girls went to a streator party with donny n terrell. it was actually fun!&nbsp;lol got&nbsp;to see&nbsp;Thumm n the boys. lol me n shelly had so much fun over that one! we love you josh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; lol it was a great night minus driving cats car home in the sleet that night! grrrrrrrr! i was home too damn early that night. saturday night me n sarah went to streator n met up with all our girls and the guys. it was the first night i saw kyle after my hardass/ his chickenshit phase. lol things were actually better than usual! Changed? lol sarah... it's so hard to believe! we went to a party, then the guys got breakfast... lol there was like a half hour conversation about box... that cody would just NOT let go.... too funny! after that we all just stayed at codys. which of course was fun!</P>
<P>ok and for anyone who has tried to give me advice about things lately-- if i've flipped out or blown off whatever you've told me, i'm sorry. i understand everyones trying to look out for me. but u gotta understand i always do whatever it is that i wanna do. im not trying to be bitchy by getting defensive, but i just hate someone sitting there telling me how wrong i am. i dont feel that way. If something happens, c`mon ya'll know me.. i keep hearing ppl say im wonderwoman.... ya'll know i can handle anything. Just dont worry about me so much. i love ya's :)</P>"

"event","<P>ok so now that the weekend from hell is finally over i've come to many differnt conclusions about so many things.</P>
<P>1) I'm gonna write a book called ""the games people play"" which i think might already be a book or something cuz it sounds familiar, but for reals. i've noticed lately how many differnt frickin games people have been playin with each other. and the sad thing is that i've realized i've been doin it alot myself! it's rediculous</P>
<P>2) The phrase ""shame on you if you fool me once, shame on me if you fool me twice"" is a pretty damn good phrase to live by</P>
<P>3) No matter how pissy, bitchy, upset, or whatever i get, it's always my girls that are willing to listen to me and do anything to make things better! ya fuck with one, ya fuck wit us all....- <STRONG>I love my girls (kat, sarah, michelle!!!!)</STRONG></P>
<P>4) Female intuition... when you have a bad feeling about something girls, trust it. </P>
<P>5) there is just way too much fucking drama in the illinios valley.... which scrouch&nbsp; tells me reeses comment from the other night as they were watching some movie on TNT.. ""isnt it a lil weird that Trish's initials are TNT and their saying is We Know Drama?"" thanx guys love you too</P>
<P>6) Sometimes it takes awhile to regret something. Sometimes it takes another situation to make you realize what you fucked up in the past.</P>
<P>7) Somethings are just better left unsaid</P>
<P>8) Is it really possible to be dizzy from being so confused? yes.</P>
<P>9) Some people are so incredibly selfish</P>
<P>10) That temper that i once had, that i got over, well it's back again, prolly not a good idea to piss me off for awhile. </P>
<P>i really dont know what else to say about anything anymore. it's like i dont care but i do? i mean i aint never needed someone to help me stand on my own two feet (<U>unlike some people</U>) so no matter what im always gonna be fine <STRONG>with </STRONG>or <STRONG>without </STRONG></P>"

"event","<P>ok so this will prolly be the most boring journal entry ever. considering i was FRICKIN SICK all weekend! duh. lol actually thursday was hella fun! me n michelle were all about going to ISU like all week cuz the boys at lamda chi were having an invite only party n of course... we were invited :) well then i was gonna go to chicago to see kat cuz i couldnt go friday cuz of work so it was like am i going or am i not going.... ok well i didnt go to chi town. so shells gets off work n were totally going to ISU... so then i convince sarah to go (who's mom still hates me i think!) michelle convinces holly to.... 4 girls n a road trip :) u know how we do! snow was deffinately not in the game plan but we worked around it. Lamda Chi party... tons of fun :)&nbsp; we randomly ran into Bri P in the basement who i havent seen in forever. well after chillin there for awhile, sarah talked to the boys who were like come to sig tau so we went over there. kyle was into his game of beer pong... lol or watching tits.... whichever... so us girls chilled with the guys. randomly kyle partner in beer pong starts trippin cuz he knows me, and he knows michelle, and he knows holly.... lol Oh Ottawa! it was one of the guys who used to hang out at the apartments! random? right. ummm there was some random drama with michelle... but since anyone who witnessed the drama&nbsp; wasnt sober i dont think any of us really know what the deal was... not even michelle.... ummm after the sig tau party all of us girls n all the guys went to one of cody's friends apartments -- i honestly gotta tell ya i dont think i've ever laughed so hard. ok these are just a few&nbsp;of the random shit that&nbsp;went on with those drunk asses, most the&nbsp;stupid shit is things kyle did but ya gotta understand he's a real amusing drunk....&nbsp;kyles drunk ass rode with me n the girls... cody was driving in front of us, kyles car. kyle keeps FLIPPING OUT trying to open the door while im driving, at every stop light, at mcdonalds... anywhere... because he thinks someone STOLE HIS CAR! it was hilarious. at mcdonalds... he got out, ran to his car, opened the door, punched fuzzy... and ran back to my car. lol oh n he's a ""balla""cuz he throws out dolla bills... but then runs after em. at the apartment he got his ass beat by toms frat paddle... just picture that..enough said..lol n then there was just the random sleeping arrangements lol not even gettin into that one...omg i just had a mental picture of CODY'S WHITE ASS running around after sarah n dancin all up on her at like 530 in the morning.... that night was too damn funny.... lol but the car ride home SUCKED!!!!!! </P>
<P>i slept all day n went to work where i got sick... and then remained sick till sunday morning... where i woke up and went to work. i went to go see scrouch n mcnally lastnight and then we went to tiki n met up with gary n reese. fun times... </P>
<P>ooooooo and be proud!!!!! i got my scholarship application in THE DAY BEFORE it was due!!!! lol whooooo hooooo!!!!! im not as big of a procrastinator as i thought! lol hell for me i feel like a god damn over achiever!</P>
<P>lol speaking of god.... random quotes from my holy roller table at work... ""smoking or non smoking? u mean for tonight or eternity?"" i was just like what? they say ""well non smokers go to heaven and smokers go to hell"" me- whatever. then later they say to me ""do u think there will be coffee in heaven? that would make me want to go even more!"" me- ""i dunno you think they'll have cigarettes and alcohol?"" and then they just looked at me like i was gonna do a trick... ya know.... turn into a snake or something....</P>"

"event","<P>like sarah said ""tonight was a total waste of make-up"". BORING! i dunno it's a wednesday so of course their aint shit to do anymore. ummmm i miss wed nights- bar nights! at rips! i dunno me n sarah met up with kat n then we met up with the streator boys n we were gonna go to a party at Grand Bear Lodge but that got busted up real quick. gayness. LET PPL DRINK DAMNIT! we aint botherin no one! anyway we all ended up just comin home. so now for the first time in i dont know how long i'm home b4 12.... this sux. well at least ya'll get a new journal entry outta it. other than tonight we really havent been doin much either. we're either hanging out in streator, or lastnight kyle n porky came down n sarah came over n we all just watched movies at my house. The wood... good movie, ghost watcher... well i was freakin out, it was kinda scary, but cheap. lol i dunno. i just jumped alot. </P>
<P>other than that the past few days have consisted of kyle waking me up, and then drama online. but i think (and hope!) thats finally all over with. i dunno really whats up. i hate being involved in shit that i dont feel like im a part of but i guess i am? i dont even know anymore. just trying to make everything fine again. which im sure is never gonna happen but least were all trying. i mean yah i've been a huge bitch n i had reason to be, but i guess there was reason for certain people to be pissed off at me too. I guess i'm just at a point were its like i'm 20 years old (im not trying to make it sound like omg im 20 im so mature now) cuz really im not, but theres just certain things that dont bother me anymore. and this whole fucking thing is one of em. i totally understand where EVERYONE is coming from cuz at one point in my life i've been in each of the people involves positions. </P>
<P>i guess i should make a correcting on my last journal entry too. basically it had said that i was at a party with kyle- drama happend- i got pissed and left- and i ended up at a party where one of my ex's happend to be at. yes i did call him to see where he was n what he was doin. but that was because people to me to cuz i&nbsp;havent seen him&nbsp;since like december. nothing was intended by that&nbsp;phone call. &nbsp;hell i didnt even talk to him when he was there the first time cuz i was too worried about kyle and all his friends and all my friends who could of possibly been getting arrested at the time. (no one got arrested) my x could tell that i was upset, which i obviously was very upset, and he just tried to make me laugh and have fun. it was never just the two of us. nothing went on. it wasnt even like that. i was just in a better mood when i left because i was at a place where there was no drama, and ppl cared about the fact that i was upset and they were trying to make me feel better. im sorry if the last entry made it sound like things were differnt from that but really thats y i was in a better mood. </P>
<P>i dunno this spring break fucking sux. i had mono last spring break and i had more fun even after the fact that i was supposed to go to florida n i couldnt go. tomorrow i think i might go visit kat up in the city, or otherwise we might go to ISU. friday theres supposed to be a buncha parties... im sure they'll all get busted cuz thats what happens around here. saturday i dunno what were doin. </P>
<P>ok so kats on the phone... she's real drunk... im gonna go talk to her. cuz she amuses me :) who rearranges their closet when it's already color coordinated, separated by seasonal, and the hangers are exactly one inch apart? kat does. </P>"

<P>so i really gotta big ass problem with school.... basically the big ass problem is i have a problem attending. u think that'd be easy to fix huh? well u try wakin ur ass up at 8 oclock... im not a morning person. i skipped class monday (i was for real sick though!) and i kinda skipping my policing class again today... after she told me thursday that if i didnt have a legit excuse for all my absenses she was gonna drop me... im getting a fucking A n i never go to class..... thats reason enough not to drop me right?! for reals i cant handle some of the people in that class... i just cant... for whoever said theres no such thing as stupid questions they've obviously never met some of the people in that class. whatever. i chilled in the lobby all afternoon. lol actually saw kyle today at school.... mirical.... possibly the one person who goes to class less than i do. quite funny when he tells me to call his ass to wake him up in the morning.... MS. RELIABLE right here! hell nah!</P>
<P>tonight (and lastnight) we just been chillin at the G-Units! lol just watchin movies shit like that. havent been there in forever n a day! sarah n kristen were supposed to make the boys spaghetti tonight... n then sarah expected me to help her make it.... girl u know i dont cook. lol so that idea got shot to hell. we ended up watching ""Saw"" which is a GREEEEEEEEEAT movie. lol i still love it! after that we watched Chris Rock n that shit was funny as hell! he was talkin to fathers sayin u know u gotta problem when ur daughter dancin on a pole.... u fucked up somewhere.... well shit i didnt need to dance on a pole to tell ya that one. dude though he made a funny ass point though ( it was a good point for reals!) he said somethin bout ""America worships money... hell thats why banks are closed on sundays... aint nobody be in church otherwise! America worships money but drugs are illegal... but ATM's are open 24 hours a day. aint nobody withdrawlin $300 at 4 Oclock in the morning for something positive...."" TRUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE coulda used that one in my essay..... </P>
<P>guess im gonna go do some homework or something. kinda worrying about SOMEONE because he's smart as hell driving around drinking..... </P>"

THAT ONE BAND is playing at the cancun in ladd.. i'd love to see ya's play but i'll prolly be at work :( not really sure what im gonna do afterwards. saturday everyones talking bout going bowling... lol i have no idea what the new fetish with bowling is lately... lol but i highly doubt anything else will be going on. sunday right now i gotta work but im gonna try to get off so i can go see cody's cheer thing in donners grove. lol i really hope someones gonna work for me cuz i really wanna go!!!! hopefully kristens gonna be able to get off work too. who knows. anyway i think im gonna go take a nap before the night! </P>"

(so if anyone has that or&nbsp;knows someone in it plz let me know) hope that dude aint like campbell. for real who actually takes attendance in college. im deffinatley not liking it. but then again thats cuz last semester i&nbsp;never went. but that was cool cuz i skipped music for a month straight n still got an A&nbsp;:) lol gotta love IV :) but im deffinatley not likin this semester. my classes are cool cuz&nbsp;their all directed towards my major but they just seem like thier gonna be hard. although i have somone i know in like every class so thats cool. so after being in class yesturday from 9:30-1:45.... well not exactly since i didnt go to the 9:30 class..... i was frickin tired as all hell but instead of&nbsp;getting to sleep i just ended up coming&nbsp;home to turn around n get ready to go to the game. which was so exciting cuz&nbsp;the streator boys came n cody tumbled&nbsp;which was totally&nbsp;hott n then he threw me up in a chair which i was like ahhhhh i love male cheerleaders :) after the game we all went back to shellers since her rents are&nbsp;outta town.&nbsp;&nbsp;other ppl stopped by but it wasnt huge or anything. lol dance party anyone?! cody taught me kristen n shellers his lil 2 step dance which was cool. we all kinda cashed out early i think? i was like 2:30 or something when we went to bed? lol i dunno. that was short lived since the boys came barging into the room but it was actually really hilarious. so then we went back downstaris for awhile... n eventually went back to bed just to get up at 930 this morn so i could make it to class... grr to brian campbell. i went to my 11 oclock just to learn ""poetry means nothing"". WELL NO SHIT lol any idiot knows that poetry is a reflection of the authors feelings but could mean one thing to the author and something completley differnt to the reader.... i really needed to be up for that? he coulda just emailed me that genious bit of information. grrr anyway i think im gonna go get some sleep b4 i get to go see scottie.... gr i have practice tonight too....

Till scottie himself said it wasnt my fault. I just felt like i should have said something sooner. n maybe that could have changed things. i was just really upset that the last time we had talked scottie was really pist at me cuz i did say something to his cousin. I hadnt slept in days, n i was always crying anything i was thinking bout it. but since i saw scottie yesturday, i feel like where he's at is a better place for him than where he was.&nbsp;i really hope things work out, but i'm not sure how well that's going to happen. no matter what i wont abandon him like everyone has told me to. i know theres a lot of people pist at him for lying to them or whatever reason, but thats ur friend. and he has a problem. i can't just leave him because of that. </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=4>this is one of those more ""juicy"" entries for those of you who think my journal is kinda boring.....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>it's been the longest past couple of days ever. things with me n luke... have not been good even though i've been pretending that they were. awhile back i kinda ditched him for my friends one night, n he was real pissed bout it. understandable. but i felt like he ditched me twice this past week n i was trying not to be upset by it but i really was. so after being super bitch since tuesday i finally saw him tonight and he kept asking me what was wrong.... i was hoping to just let it go but i got really pissed n started yelling bout how we never see each other n he ditches me n it's ok, but if i ditch him it's not... yada yada yada....that wasnt the only thing bothering me but i was trying to let it be the only thing i let out. well i kinda went on about how were right for each other, but wrong timing with us being so busy n all this shit, n he took it as me breaking up with him. not want i intended... but it's what happened. so after both of us leaving pissed he called me back with a big fat ""i told u so"" that i would eventually break up with him. didnt make me happy. so i went to the guys house to keep myself busy&nbsp;n ended up writting a journal entry for D that had to be ya know like half a page n it turned out like 2 pages... oops. anyway on my way home i talked to kat (i talked to shellers tonight too who made me feel better also) but kat knew what i was freaking out about. the thing is that since casey i haven't had a boyfriend that could be potentially serious till luke. and that whole serious boyfriend thing scares the shit outta me. kat made me realize that i cant keep ruining potentially good relationships for fear of it ending like me and casey. not to say mine n casey's relationship was bad... i have some of the greatest memories with him but we did have alot of downfalls and those are what scare me. kat knows what i went through n she understands how scared i am for that to happen again but reassured me that she wont let it happen again :) after talking about everything to her i called luke back n explained it to him. we talked bout alot of shit n decided to forget the fights these past couple months n start over. i feel so much better. i was so scared of losing him, and keeping him at the same time. we promise to make things work n that i'll talk to him about things more when shits bothering me. im really exciting that things worked out.... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=4>nuttin has really changed much since my last post. ummm last thing i remember that was actually FUN was last tuesday we all drank at the guys house. i tried sleeping at like 2:30 cuz i had practice at 10 the next morning but that didnt work cuz bout every half hour someone would jump into bed with me n wake me up! lol it was all good though. i finally gave up at like 4 n got up to check on my boys. lol n they deffinately needed a babysitter by that time. i think i went to bed again at like 6:30&nbsp; maybe? i dunno i was woken up again at like 7 when D fell face first onto the bed n passed out.... well he actually landed on me. n his ass wasnt moving. lol so i just crawled up into the corner n went back to bed. n then i had practice at 10 am! lol oh yes i was ready for that one...... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>thanksgiving sucked. i was so fucking sick! i worked 8am-11am that day n i didnt feel good. came home n slept through dinner.... woke up at like 3:30 n went to lukes. deffinatley didnt feel good so i came home n slept from like 5:30 thursday night till 8:30 saturday morning. shitty huh? missed my tourny in iowa :( but i felt better satruday so i went to see luke n then me n my girls went to see steve play at rips. Eric was also home so i got to see him too which was great of course! i started getting sick again though so i went home early. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>lately i havent really seen luke&nbsp;much. he works during the day n has classes 2 nights a week. n then i have something goin on every night. lukes usually sleeping by the time im done with practice/work/games/class/ or whatever. but everythings ok i guess! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=4>ok so im sooooooo frickin tired.... im SO glad that school is finally out for awhile :) ya know a whole 3 days off. but next week should be good cuz i have my last human sexuality test on tuesday (which means i have a final to study for) and then no criminal justice all week :) lol gotta love dr. donna. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>so i havent posted in awhile. ummm this past weekend was kinda shitty. friday i worked (which means money!!!!) lol n then i went with luke over to matts. it was a great night n luke was just way too cute. so i guess thats why i didnt understand why we were almost breaking up on saturday.... so after an entire day of fighting we made up, n then when i went to see him that night... we fought again. basically he was upset with me cuz my friends are all guys. n any girl or guy knows that when they hang out with ppl of the opposite sex... theres always rumors. so luke was hearing shit. i understood where the accusations were comming from but it just hurt me that he couldnt trust me. so after a long ass time of screaming we realized that wasnt solving anything so we sat down n talked. about ALOT of differnt shit. n everything seems to be going really well since then. i realize he has friends n i trust him, and vise versa. i think we really could be great but it's kinda one of those give n take type things. so we'll see how things go! :)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=4>saturday i spent the entire day/night with luke. i had seriously so much fun. he woke me up rather early...grr... but we drove up to st. charles for a classic car show. lotta the cars were sold n off the lot already but there were some that we were totally drooling over... lol like the shelby mustangs n the old camaros :) my dream car.... anyway. after getting lost on the way home n almost ending up in chicago we FINALLY made it back. i had dinner with his family that night which was really weird for me at first but then me, lukes mom, sis, n sis in law all sat around n talked after dinner n i totally felt better. lol&nbsp;he said i was approved by the fam. which is great :) after dinner we went to some party that the cops came to... but of course since it is the illinois valley... they did nothing but watch ppl walk down the street with coolers.&nbsp;lol gotta love those&nbsp;small towns.&nbsp;we didnt&nbsp;stay that long and went back to lukes and watched a movie and i totally fell asleep... as did luke... and i just woke up n went home :) that was seriously the greatest day i've had in awhile :) waking up to luke and falling asleep to him :)&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>today i actually got up and went to church. i was only 20 min late though for a mass thats only 30 min long... oops. after that i came home to study but luke called n wanted to hang out so my options were study for personality exam... or go see luke... wow difficult choice. so anyway me n&nbsp;him just went out walkin at his cousins and then went out to starve rock and got pulled over by the conservation police who made me get outta the car because they thought i was ""hiding"" something. grrr... after that we just went for a drive n then chilled at his house. i've been home for&nbsp;like 3 hours now&nbsp;n still havent started studying for that exam... maybe i should get on that. i have watched the hollow for like the 2nd time tonight. this movie sux lemme tell ya. dunno why im watching it over n over again. i love halloween :) actually we were watching like scarriest places in the world or some shit today, and like this couple wanted to get married in this haunted scottish castle... that would be fucking amazing. especially on halloween!? i think i know where and when i want my wedding! yah lol as i was told im a ""freak"" but i love halloween :)</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><EM><FONT size=4>i havent updated in awhile (which is&nbsp;the phrase&nbsp;my journal entries usually start off with...) last weekend was one of those weekend.... friday i worked n of course i closed, after work i went with luke for a lil bit n we just chilled n talked. i really dunno what to think of that! first of all it's kinda weird how he seems to be so perfect. I've always been told ""if it's too good to be true, then it usually is"" it just sux cuz im so used to having the fucked up relationship that i have my gaurd up so much i honestly feel like im waiting for him to fuck up. and i've told him that, n he just says&nbsp;if u wait for something to go&nbsp;wrong then it usually does.&nbsp;&nbsp;so i'm real confused with that but things are just so great! lol totally just thought bout that nickelback song.... ""somethings gotta go wrong cuz i'm feeling way too damn good"" i really need to stop that. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>saturday i worked again, and me n michelle went down to u of i at like 10 o'clock. the party was actually pretty fun! we went down to meet up with luke n his friend but it was real random seeing people from sba there, and then theres josh standing there shocked that im there. lol (that drunken/shocked face was priceless) me n luke went for a walk for food at like 2:30, michelle was playing with some lp kidz that were there, n on our way back i realize we were walking right past brandons... nice. and after that we ended up falling asleep in my car till shellers woke me up at 4, cuz luke was like completely passed out n not aware of anything. so me n shellers were woken up at about 6 by cops ambulance and fire trucks because there was sumthin goin down in the apartment building (we were parked in the parking lot) crazy. driving home was insane also cuz it was so fucking foggy. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>monday night i had night class n went out to granville. jimbo got a lil pissy with me cuz i slapped him in the face with the dirty/nasty sponge i was using to wash all of derrick n alex's dishes (that had been stacked up for like a week) lol sorry jimbo :)</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>tuesday i worked</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>tonight im not really sure whats going on. i was supposed to be going to rockford with michelle n kristen but i have to go to a wake tonight so im not gonna go anymore. luke said something bout going to fox valley but dunno? lol i really really DONT wanna go to rips.....</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>ooooo and i heard that me melissa laura kat n trina are gonna be famous! ""clear and present mole"" is not on sale or so i hear.... which for those of u who dont know is the movie made bout me n my friends being ""slores"" and infecting the illinios valley with diseases. lol hell i wanna copy! i'd love to watch that movie over n over again just to remind myself of your pathetic lives and how you had nothing better to do than make a movie bout me n my friends. lol 5 dollars is totally worth that !</FONT></EM></P>"

"event","<P><FONT size=4>ok so this past weekend has been </FONT><FONT size=6>CRAZY!!! </FONT><FONT size=4>wednesday was a crazy night.... (read michelles journal on that one) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>then on thursday me michelle n kristen decided to go visit Brandon.... in DEBUQUE IOWA.... lol quite the roadtrip. it was even crazier than our road trip to dave this summer.... the way up all we did once we got on 20 was talk about how we were driving through all this crazy corupt towns like u'd see in a horror movie... ya know where like everyone in th town is a crazy serial killer, killing innocent people whose cars break down.... (n yes michelles car had broke down like the weekend before....) nutz! up there we had&nbsp; a good time till we all got busted by the RA's n had NO WHERE TO STAY AT 1:30 in the morning.... so what do we do?! Drive back to ILLINOIS! lol taking brandon as our hostage/protector from the crazy people in the crazy towns. lol me n kristen just passed out as soon as we got back. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>then on friday i had to work... which i was having a really shitty night at work, but then at like 9:30 i took out the trash n found a bouque of flowers on my car.... :) thanx luke!!!! lol that really did cheer me up! after work i just went to michelles, n me her brittney n brandon all watched pet semetary till me and brandon got this crazy idea of going out to all the haunted places around here. so we all jump in the car, but brittney was sick by the time we got to our first stop, so michelle stayed with her while me n brandon went exploring.... the place we went to was on scare road in mendota, and supposedly cell phones n shit like that go nutz around this road.... kinda random that as we were walking through a barn my cell phone rang but my id said privacy call, it was just static for&nbsp;a min n then hung up... ok kinda weird but didnt think anything of it. we get back to my car n brandon has a missed call from a privacy number also... and even worst they were like a few minutes apart.... ok WEIRD! anyway we ended up going back to michelles shortly after cuz brittney was not doin to well... michelle was like freakin out n i was SOOOOOOOO confused why! (she just had a lotta shit to do) so me n brandon just sat around talkin all night... ya know till he puked.... lol! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>saturday night i met luke n we had so much fun! we stopped by Claudettes for a bit in oglesby, n then&nbsp;he took me to this haunted spot in lowell (i was tellin&nbsp;him bout me n brandons episodes from the night&nbsp;before) ok... more weird shit happened! so he took me to the remains of this bridge over the vermillion river... like supposedly back in the day like the bridege collapsed and&nbsp;all the people on the&nbsp;train died n it's supposedly haunted. well he's like u'll hear things if u chill here for awhile.... so like we were just talkin n what not, and like all of a sudden i hear kidz laughing n i just look at him he's like I TOLD U!&nbsp;so after that we met up with his friends n went to this&nbsp;party in the middle of no where... yet the cops STILL&nbsp;came.... we were out there for awhile, n me n luke did end up just chillin n talkin&nbsp;for awhile. after the party we went to 4 star n then called it a night kinda early... but i did not mind at all cuz i&nbsp;REALLY needed sleep... but i didnt really get that cuz i was on the phone with michelle all night. grrr to&nbsp;stress right girl!?&nbsp;haha u say im ur rational thinking???? lol i have never been thought to be rational.... but hey it's cool!&nbsp;lol so i just remembered&nbsp;our convo from lastnight too shellz.... u remember the whole ur god n i'm ur arch angel? make sure u tell brandon that one...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>as for lastnight i just worked n then went to granville to see jimbo cuz i havent seen him in FOREVER!!! even though i've talked to him every night this week... even though he dont really remember talking to me... he is the craziest kid i know! so i just sat there n did my art homework cuz ya know i got this quiz in that class tonight n i know nothing... so after that i just came home n ended up sittin up on the phone again with michelle :) lol i love our late night phone calls... lol ur like a boyfriend hun.... lol so ya she called me lastnight with this crazy plan that her n the boys created.... lol oh man.... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>anyway right now im just chilling... supposedly studying... but im really watching saved by the bell n waitin for luke to call so we can go out to lunch! </FONT></P>"

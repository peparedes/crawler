Friends, yes very confused, wondering if the new ones will stick around and trying to figure out how trustworthy the old ones are.
Life, I don't know what I want to do, go back to college? go into theater? cruise ships? japan? what!?!
Love life, this is the one that's on my mind right now, I don't even know how to describe what I'm going through in my head right now, ugg I need to figure out some answers before I go insane!

P.S. Question for you guys, is it wrong to switch your interest of a guy to his friend? I mean he suggested it so there's no issue of hurt feelings, but I'm afraid it makes me look desperate or boy crazy when that's not the case, he's just a really good guy, so so so confused"

"event","Figured I should update, not much happening as usual, just work and the one class.
Did have a fun weekend, Friday for Halloween I went to the Japanese conversation club, wow was so lost half the time, I really can't wait til I can actually carry out a normal conversation, until then I only get a few phrases and a few words here and there, i can tell when someone's swearing or using slang though.
Then we went over to Yoshi's house/hostel thingy, he works at a hostel and has a HUGE room to himself, and we drank haha, Kenzou ended up ditching me there with all these people that I didn't know, but oh well I had a blast without him.
Saturday I had class and then hung out with Breanne and Anna, a couple of girls at my work, after that Kenzou had invited me out to karaoke, which is always entertaining. I mean who doesn't want to see a six foot asian man (Newt) singing Micheal Jackson at the top of his lungs and way off key. Or Invisible by Clay Aiken... or new kids on the block, ok my stomach hurt from laughing so hard. 
And I still stand by this, I CANNOT sing in Korean to save my life, especially when the lyrics aren't written out in this alphabet and i have to go by heart because I can't read korean. oh. so. bad.
Anyway I""m going to go study and be a good girl tonight, Japanese grammar is sooooo messed up this is going to take weeks to grasp."

I'm working full time and going to take a class at the u of a in about a month for beginners japanese, that's about all that's happening haha. My birthday's in a couple of days, but I'm doing nothing exciting for it or anything, just going to the movies, well at least I have that day off work, maybe I'll go shop or something, make a day of being alone until the evening. 
well a rather boring post but I figured I should update just to let people know I'm still alive lol. Oh and I do check livejournal all the time to read other posts, I just don't have anything to sat back."

"event","yes, two posts back to back, the first one was an update on life, this one is a bit of a rant

I'm bored, lonely and restless, I don't have a job, can't really go outside with these allergies, all my friends seem to be too busy, either with boyfriends, work or other people in their lives. I've began to realize that my legacy in life and the impact I have on people is minimal. Sure I have a nack for getting people to like me right away and I'm considered a people person, but I can never get that to stick, when I leave a place from school or work, it seems like I leave all the people there behind and start fresh again. In some cases that's good, but it's also rather lonely.

Take this time in my life for example, since I'm unemployed and not at school, my social situation is very limited, apart from the occasional lunch and my roomates, I'm nothing more than a hermit. Also I'm getting another one of those freak out times in my life that indicates that I haven't truly ""found myself"". Very confused in everything right now, right down to the clothes I wear and the way I present myself to people. Something tells me that in High School I wasn't confident enough to be myself, and it's kind of backfiring at this point in my life.

Arg I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, all I know is that there's something missing, I mean I love Edmonton, my theatre work, living with my brother, the freedom and everything, but there's something else....
Anyway there's my rant, not expecting anyone to really comment, since I'm sure it doesn't make much sense to anyone else, I just needed to do something about my feelings, otherwise I think I'd burst."

"event","Haven't posted in ages. Oh well, most people looking here know that I'm now living in Edmonton with my brother, we just lost a couple of roomates, (Motto and Kendrick) and gaining a couple (Lindsey and...well not sure of her name, she's coming from Germany). I'm stuck in the house at the moment, I went for a walk to the bank this morning and got a bit of hay fever, sucks that I can't enjoy the nice weather without feeling like crap, but the walk was worth it!
Buying posters tonight yay! Still no job boo!, but still looking at some really neat boutiques yay! Just poked myself in the eye boo!
Ok I should go rest, this hay fever's getting to me, can't wait til tomorrow, we get some more furniture!"

"event","Hiya Rangers! I have been getting many of the same questions from all of you about the Character Book for Vic. So this is a FAQ post and guidelines so I don't have to type out the answers thirty times! If you have any other questions, suggestions or if these didn't answer them to your statisfaction PM, post here or on the forum, e-mail me at myou_gal@yahoo.com or come find me! I'm always around on the chat and forums.<br /><br /><font color=""#0000ff""><b>How long do I have to draw?</b></font><br />I'm getting this ready for next July/August so you have plenty of time to draw. That being said I would like to receiving drawings as soon as possible so I can at least have a few of the pages done and I don't end up staying up all night for a week getting it done.<br /><br /><b><font color=""#0000ff"">How big can it be?</font></b><br />NO BIGGER than 10 inches tall and 12 inches wide. This is because I'm making a 12X12 scrapbook and I need some room to have the Character Bios. That doesn't mean it has to be that big either, do the size that you want, just no thumbnails so small that no one can see who it is.<br /><br /><b><font color=""#0000ff"">Do I have to send you the Original?</font></b><br />It would be nice! But if you want to keep the original or live far away from me and don't want the postage scan and e-mail the drawing to me.<br /><br /><b><font color=""#0000ff"">I want to contribute but I can't draw, is there anything I can do?</font></b><br />Yes! You can help me with the Character Biographies! I haven't seen half of these animes so I'm doing a lot of research for each character so any help I would love it. Even if you're drawing a character and want to write up their bios just tell me. Bios can be e-mailed to me, they might have to be tweaked a bit for space on the scrapbook but I'll try my hardest to get them in there word perfect.<br /><br /><b><font color=""#0000ff"">Once I'm done, what kind of information do I give you?</font></b><br />I would like the artists signature, screen name and state/province and country so Vic can see who drew it and where they are from.<br /><br /><b><font color=""#0000ff"">Where do I send it?</font></b><br />This one I'll answer with all of you privately for obvious reasons. When you're going to send my this original PM or e-mail.<br /><b><font color=""#0000ff""><br />Can I draw more than one character?</font></b><br />Not right now! Choose one and when the first deadline passes <font color=""#ff0000"">Sept 30, 2007</font> I will accept second choices, this way every Ranger has a chance of drawing one of the characters and one person doesn't get all of his popular ones.<br /><br /><br />And oddly enough.....<b><font color=""#0000ff"">Are you a Mod or friend of Vic?</font></b><br />No, I'm actually a fairly new Ranger. I'm just a die-hard fan of his and I just had this idea.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RED DAWN<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Myou"

"event","ok, yesterday was bad, and I'm going to say this once, it was not my fault.
I slept over at Marshall's Friday, then yesterday I was driving people home b/c it's out in the country. Kelsey needed a ride and she's out in the country too, I didn't want to be mean, but intuition told me not to, no one listened to me and I gave her a ride anyway.
ok, always go with intuition, on the way to Kelsey's I hit a major pothole, it had been raining for a couple before and my car got engulfed with mud, I mean I had to stop in the middle of the road and use about a vat of washer fluid because I couldn't see daylight out of my front winsheild. I washed off the windows at Kelsey's and went to town to drop Jenelle and Rhys off, then I get stopped by the cops!
I'm still wondering why he originally pulled me over because he said it was b/c he couldn't see the signal light as it was still covered in mud, but he wouldn't have seen me use that light until he pulled me over. Anyway, that was not my fault! It's not like I was cruising around town with the muddy car, I was taking the most direct route to town and he couldn't say otherwise. Damn cops just my luck too, I saw him and i wasn't speeding at all so he must have just been bored. SHHH the parents aren't going to find out about this one, I didn't get a ticket and they don't need to know anything :)

horrible horrible day everyone."

GRR I WANT THE BOUNTO ARC TO END NOW!! Okay, 83 went NOWHERE!! it's all about this stupid Bounto's past and all this mushy stuff and hehehe this is great, Legato Blue Summers cries in the memory, I mean he bawls. 
Anyway our three heros are still in mortal peril and I'm angry, but there's only one thing that is keeping me from breaking stuff. right before the end of the eppy Kira shows up!!!! *Squeel seizure squeel KIRA* ok ok ok, but he shows up to save Ichigo, who we already know is going to survive, but what about the other two? huh tell me if my fav character is going to survive!! I want my Renji to survive b/c it's no fun going to convention as a recently killed off character, I'd be attacked! and what about Kiego! he's got to live, he's all with energy and jealousy.

Ok I'm calming down a bit more, only with the promise of a ONE HOUR SPECIAL next week! yes, k we all know that one hour specials have something huge in them (unless they are just fillers grrr)
k the only specials I can remember were signifcant.
The meeting of Ichinose (this was the new opening I think)
The End of the fight with the water dolls as well as the story of Kenpachi
The end of the soul society arc (of course)
The first meeting of the bountos and revealing of the mod souls.
so this new one hour special can only mean the end of the dreaded bounto arc...right? for the love of....I want this arc to end!"

"event","Last night we got back from YC, that's a conference that thousands of people gather to praise Jesus Christ. Sounds religious I know, but it rocks, it's like a weekend long concert. Anyway it rocked. We got autographs from Panic Squad, which are a totally awesome improv group, and the best of all the lead singer of Hawk Nelson! No one else got to get a pic with him but we met him out back of his concert and did! I'll post the pic as soon as Shawna e-mail's it to me. It was awesome and I'm glad I went even though United Youth, but Tree63 rocked. Anyone from the Edmonton area that went to YC give me a shout, I'd love to talk!"

I'm freaking tired but it was fun, my last tour and now I'm graduating, it's so sad. Oh well I'll be doing a lot more shows with tech as my job, c-ya all tomorrow at school (BOO school, BOO homework, BOO tests)

"event","Okay, don't know what I did to the old Amanda, but the coward is gone. Just this week I have climbed three teir scaffolding to hang lights, tried to donate blood and today I went on the roller coaster in WEM. Now that may not sound like a big deal to you but it's a FREAKING HUGE deal to me, I hate heights, I hate roller coasters, I hate going upside down and I hate doing this in front of all of my classmates, but I did it!

Course while I was up there I swore....a lot...a lot a lot... and in different languages too! Somehow swearing in Japanese and French says more than in English. But Amanda is not a coward anymore, there is nothing that is too scary for me to try now! Sky Diving and Bungee Jumping here I come!"

"event","okay, so we had the blood ppl come to our school today to take donations, so I decided I'll give some. When I get into the chair after all the screening and stuff, they can't get my blood out! They only got about a quarter of a pint or so and then it stopped. I guess that the blood is NOT in me to give. Oh well, I got some free juice and cookies plus a wicked bruise out of the whole deal."

"event","Okay, I'm tired and bitchy so 'cuse me if I sound whiny. I get home from Tour tonight, mind you it was only for one night, but I come home and my dad picks me up at the school, the first thing he says to me is really rude. I'm not even exagerating here, we were bickering as we got into the Jeep and by the time we were at the end of the school's driveway we were full out fighting. It's pathetic, I can't believe we can't be civil towards each other. It was over the stupidest thing too, that my cell phone needs a new battery, last week he told me it didn't and that it was something I did to it, then tonight he screams at me to quit bitching and get a new battery, there's no pleasing him!

Then I get home and my mother is on the phone, no really? She was just gone all weekend and so was I and we haven't talked for three days, so doesn't do anything to acknowledge me, then half an hour later when she gets off the phone, she talks to me for two minutes.

Tour was fun though (not that my parents would know, they never asked) My favorite parts would have to be Dogeball on the trampoline and the backstage cuddling. Next weekend it's off again, yay cuddlefest *ahem* I mean tour 2006!"

"event","ya so today was the same thing, run of the mill, nothing special. I'm so freaking bored with my life right now, I only look forward to the fangirling that Roni and I do everyday. Then I just get excited, yay convention! It's the break in a boring day. Anyway, I can't wait for Easter, on Good Friday me and about 20 other students at our school are going to Europe! It's like 7 days away and I can't wait to go shopping in Paris!"

"event","Hey everyone, just a word of warning this is totally a fangirl Bleach post so if you're against our whole anime thing STOP RIGHT HERE! :)

k, this weekend Kim, Roni and I stayed up real late of Friday watching Bleach and on Saturday we went shopping, we found out how to make super sweet Urahara hats, who is a really cool dude that our Kim is dressing up as. We bumped Jeremy back up to being our Ichigo, Roni's still being our adorable uniform Rukia, but as for me I got my gender changed. I went from Orihime to Renji, which rox b/c I get a sword, but sux b/c I have to die my hair a vibrant red, I mean vibrant just look.

Crazy, but we're having so much fun making these costumes.
it's going to rock, I'm doing this costume except I'm not wearing the purple visor, I want to wear the tattoos thanks."

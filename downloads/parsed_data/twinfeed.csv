<big><i>Nice Weath</big></i>

i just woke up about an hour ago... had my bathin suit all ready to whip on.. nox'd up my face (noxema)  then jumped in the lake had to bail the boat too.. she rained like nuts lastnight... so we took a quick ol' cruise in the boat.. pulled the plug to let out the water.. turns out we run outta gas.. ha so i let some fumes out and that seemed to help the suckage... made'r home in time.. robert was at shore.. wantin the motor for minnow trappin.. so that means we'll have to use the canoe today.. 

<big><b>Yesterday</big></b> 
<big><i>Pickin' Blue berries for a living?</big></i>

we went blue berry pickin all day yesterday... sorta tryin to keep'r on the down-low... we wanna keep this place all to our self and raid the place out.. before anyone steals our spunk ;) but man.. i can't believe how FAT n' juicey these suckers are this year.. we're gonna sell them $30.00 a bucket... that's about 4 litres.. the size of an ice cream bucket... we're doin good so far though.. already made $30.00 and started pickin yesterday.. already got our canoe packed up and ready.. gonna start off at the east end of our lake today.. and just search it up for blue berries.. that's our life right now.. pickin' blue berries for a living... haha and maybe clean cabins for our old boss.. and bear hunt with bud dickson.. so ya.. back to the odd random jobbies again.... whoa...

but ya.. that's  life right now.. maybe it'll be different in another two days.. we'll see what happens...  

so hopefully by the end of this week we'll already make $300.00 ....  ya wouldn't believe how perfect the weather is for blue berries this year.. major hot to major rain to major hotness again.. so ya.. that'll spark'm up.. gotta keep this on the DL though.. we don't want anyone else stealin our berry spots... ha.. like they have the time.. but man.. talk about backaches.. doin all that crouchin' n' kneeling.. had to let some whine'age out..

<Big><b>other than that.. 

</big></b>britts passed right out behind me.. she keeps doin the switch to the side thing... rolly polly.. ha.. it's gonna be a nice day today.. says sunny 26 C ... yesterday it says spose to t-storm.. i think that already happened lastnight.. major lightenin and thunder.. loved it... i love the rush of power offage too... just means more family time and talkage.. how tender..

<big><b>Can't Wait</big></b>

family reunion's coming up ..and clayton's friend is coming up soon.. stayin here for awhile.. he's a tattoo artist.. so we might get very good deals... maybe even free he says.. so tattoo's here we come... again and again.. man i can go forever......

It's gonna be a good day today... up to 24 or something.. i dont know what that is in F.. im back to Celsius i guess... ahh.. me mom and amanda might go to our island.. famous black pussy island.. tan a bit.. who knows.. or go blue berry picking.. sounds fun.. mom's also gotta do a couple things with our fire'age... we're gonna write a letter to bob sally and the other owners (that liked us) that live in texas... 

uncle marsh gave us some tips lastnight about our overly worked hours.. and how we can make more money then we shoulda.. so sounds good.. hopefully this all works out and we get more bling.. we were spose to call bud dickson lastnight.. he wants us to work for him.. and do bear hunting and yard work stuff.. dave also wants us ... clean cabins and dinner stuff.. i still don't wanna work for anyone just yet.. sorta wanna keep the options open and breathe a lil eh.. no more rippage..

britt took off to thunderbay with brandi this morning.. we gave her a note to pick us up 3 jumbo shreddies.. so hopefully SHE won't forget like court ha.. man.

us, clay and mom (i think) are doin yard work today...

me and amanda camped out lastnight at black pussy island (weird name.. dave made it up cause our black cat bubba got lost and stranded on that island for a night ha.. it's so small too) ... but ya.. we camped out there lastnight.. it was pretty nuts.. britt's pal nick had to get flown to the hospital...he dove in shallow water and came up with a big gash on his head.. blood everywhere ... i didn't see this happen.. we were at home at the time.. ben came over and told us the news.. so we zoomed to the resort and whoa.. he was already in atikokan hospital... britt went with him and judy.. turns out he had to get 9 stitches.. and our cheap town didn't have the right tools to do the surgery.. so he had to get flown in a helicopter to thunder bay.. the helicopters go right over our house too.. so it was so... something.. like.. oh there goes nick.. it was nuts... so after findin out the flyage... dave n' judy had to hop in the van and cruise to tbay about 11pm ... = resort is ours... but ya .. no big big parties.. just major music and drinkage.. i really gotta lay off the slides though.. woke up with a pounder today... headache! 

so anyway.. man.. i passed out on the beach.. then got up.. hopped in boat with the sis.. went to our black pussy island.. where we already set up our tent and crap.. made a bom fire.. then pigged out on munchies and hit the sack... turns out lee came later that night.. and got a lil freaky... i think he thought he was gonnag get twin-teamed.. if ya know what i mean.. man.. he soooo got burned haha...

well ya.. we also gave dave a note to get 3 jumbo shreddies when he gets to tbay..  oops.. bad timing.. i probably shouldn't be thinkin of cereal when someones practically dying... (hopefully he'll be okay) 

amanda's behind me sleeping.. when i woke up.. i jumped right into the lake.. can't believe how warm eva is this year.. sandford is sooooo cold compared to this (and sandfords freakin warm) ... nuts..

there's lots of things happenin these days.. we're thinkin of doing our canoe trip soon.. here to atikokan and pick blueberries the whole way there.. then sell them when we get back.. mom said her boss at work will pay $30 a bucket... so that's awesome (icecream bucket) ... that way we can have fun doin our thing and make money too.. as long as im gettin some sorta income.. i feel a lil more.. ya know.. secured up!"

so a few days ago.. i wrote the tree planting job people an email about what and how to get the job.. and this is what i wrote...
<blockquote>

hey.. 
 
i was looking through www.jobbank.gc.ca .. and came across tree planting..
 
me and my sister love the outdoors.. so we're really curious about this tree planting stuff..
so.. do we just mail you our resumes.. or have you mail us something we fill out ?? ..
 
thanks a lot.. let me know anytime... 
 
here's our address incase you need it..

she just wrote back tonight... <blockquote>

Hi Nicole and Amanda,
 
We are currently hiring tree planters for our 2005 Spring Tree Plant.  I have attached an application for the position.  You can both fill out an application and email it back to me.  I will look them over and be in touch if I have any questions.  The format on the application may have changed(if our programs are different).  Don't worry, fill it out as best you can.  
 
So a little information for you to think about on tree planting.  Tree planting can be a very rewarding experience if you push yourself to achieve your goals and succeed in meeting them.  It can be a very monotonous and frustrating experience if you are just hanging out for most of the day, day after day, waiting for the next day off. Our day off is spent in camp.  Camp is the place where you eat, sleep, and live for the contract in a tent that you bring with you.  You can hang out in camp with all the new friends that you've met.  Planting is hard and very tiring.  Every time you plant a tree you are basically bending over and touching your toes.  Sounds not too bad.  But, you are doing this with tree bags at your hips that are about 50lbs.  You will be taught proper technique(easy) to plant the tree and to plant your piece.  If you work at it, you too can plant 3000 trees.  A good goal for a new planter is 1500, after the first 2 weeks.  But, I will tell you the truth, that many new planters plant only a few hundred trees a day for the first little bit (and it is exhausting) .  But when you get you get!  And then.............. you start making $$$$$$$$$$$$      
 
None of that is too turn you off.  That is just how it is.  It is a good way to make money.  But you make what you plant. This is a piece rate (you get paid for what you do) job.  The more you do, the more you make.
 
If this is for you, I look forward to seeing your applications in my Inbox.  Until then ladies.........
 
have a great day,

My bones feel breakable right now.. empty brittle feeling again. this always happens when i dont get much sleep... but man.. feels like i been up for friggin ever.. mom woke up at 5 am this morning.. i saw the lights peakin through the door.. and couldn't stop rollin over to find that sleepable comf.. so i had to wake up around 6:30 and just.. frig.. stay up i guess... i also drove britt out to the bus again.. and came back and watched the L word with amanda since she missed'r lastnight.. don't mind watchin that one again.. diggggable eh.. but ya.. me mom n' amanda are goin to town to do this smart serve course today.. i think clay's gotta come in with us to.. to do some'a his money crap.. then who knows what happens afterwards.. so far all my horoscopes are sayin crap about my intense feelings.. so hopefully it all soaks into positive flow.. and lots of smiles kick in..

yesterday me and amanda walked all around town.. turns out we didn't even call cory or rory.. haha.. time flew by quick.. and we were in our daze.. lopin around.. lookin at things.. and thinkin.. what if.. and shite.. we were gonna buy 2 long mirrors.. and put it apart.. break it and glue it to our wall.. but figure we can just wait and think'r all out.. we're really in the mood to re-do our room sometime.. also looked at some paint.. and we're thinkin about gettin red, white and black... and just play with it around the walls.. maybe mix some up with our peachy orange we already got here... figure somethin out eh... then haul our wooden tv stand and trade it up for dad's old one.. it's in the shack right now.. but try somethin new eh.. it's black and a lot smaller = more room in room.. = yippy yi yay.. also thinkin about takin out this brown couch.. all it does is sits in here.. lonely and outta touch.. hahaha.. so ya.. maybe after town we'll be in the mood to do the re-arrangements.. it's been yearssssss... compared to our everyday shiftage.. whoaa.. things change eh.. so.. what else happened yesterday.. we saw mr williams come outta the barber shop.. haven't seen him since schoolio... asked how he was.. asked how we were.. i told him.. ""yaaa.. we just came back from the unemployment center.. filled out some sheets"" ... he sat there with a pause.. ""haha.. what.. you gettin unemployed? or employed.."" so ya.. i said the ""un"" part.. oops.. then i asked about his hair.. but his wifes in there gettin'r snipped.. and told us he has to get a tan soon cause he's goin to the dominican republic.. man.. lucky fool eh.. says he don't got the native skin like us.. so he's gotta use the fake sun.. ha.. then things started gettin quiet so he shut'r down and said ""ahh.. you guys are gettin cold"" ... (we were only in sleeves and it's kinda winter i guess eh) ... but as long as we're on the move.. and there's stores around.. what's the worry eh.. so that was cool seeing him.. then went across to the tattoo place.. tried to talk to steve but he was quite the business.. and ha.. such a gemini.. all into his works.. no talk just walk.. eh.. so we took off and went back to lookin for crap to imagine and stuff.. i bought 2 roller ball pens.. these make me have more patience to write.. cause they're so.. workably inkable and dark.. my hand gets to tired pressing too hard on them plain ones eh.. ha.. whiner eh.. ahh.. then bought some staples.. might get creative soon.. im feeling it.. plus it's our ""3"" month now.. all about expression and usin our creativity.. kinda funny how that works.. cause we're feeling it..

<big><i>Be Nice to Yourself</i></big>

Home and family life continues to be emphasized, nicole, which is going to help you focus on essential issues. Do watch out on Tuesday when Mercury squares Pluto, as this might not be such a great time for those sensitive family discussions. In fact, avoid them like the plague, unless you want World War III to break out in your own kitchen. If you can approach any necessary discussion from a healing perspective this would be very helpful. But if you let it rip it might take a while for the ice to thaw. Mars squares Jupiter on Thursday bringing a few new issues your way. Do you knuckle under and earn your daily bread? Or get out and have fun with your friends? Only you know the real response to this; perhaps you could do both if you work extra hard. Venus conjuncts Uranus on Friday; this is wonderful for loosening your attachment to anyone or anything, and enjoying a sense of independence. You may want space at home on your own patch and this will do you a world of good before you get involved with the outside world once more. Mercury moves into Aries, making you want to speak out in favor of enjoying yourself. Go get out and have fun!"

<big><b>oh and.. todays horoscope</big></b><blockquote>An unexpected opportunity to take a short trip may present itself to you today, nicole. Hop on that boat or train and see where it ends up. If you have no real excuse to take off and travel, make one up. You don't really need one anyway. The point is, it is time to get away from your current surroundings and explore other ways of living. If the time is not right for you to get out and travel, at least make a plan now for a trip later on."

(tattoos-n-art.com) see if there's any new contests in.. but there's not.. also gonna email steve and ask about the brewster tattoo.. maybe scan brewster and he can practice it up.. get'r all drawn.. that way it aint rushed and just on the spot eh.. so ya.. whoa.. my stomaches aching like a bite-ch..

lastnight was kinda freaky.. well.. it probably started earlier in the day.. from one lil thing.. but once somethin pops the whole things comes fallin down.. i guess clayton let bubba out for some exercise because it was a pretty nice day eh.. so ya.. good idea la la la.. and i let her back in.. he just freaks out.. gets all whiney toned on me.. i sorta tell him to ease down the tone'age... 

we sorta get in a lil ... scrap.. nothing harmless.. until mom buds in.. and frig.. once people get into the clash it's a tornado eh.. so turns out we had to get things talked out anyway.. because things have been quiet at the house lately.. the bottled upness quiet type.. so mom's tryin to get clay to talk.. but he rolls a fatty and sucks it in like usual... it took him about 5 mins to loosin up after that fatty..

i think that that's the only thing he can do to control his temper.. it's not good either.. cause he'll never learn to controll his attitude without something to do it for him... like weed n' alcohol..

so he got a call from bobby later that night.. to go hang with the boys.. drink n' have a fish fry.. he took off about 6pm..  came back totally wasted.. i was in the washroom at the time.. brushin my teeth .. i can already tell by the sound of his voice.. he was the ""Freaky"" kinda drunk.. the kind that's gonna just talk talk n' talk all night.. well turns out ..first thing he says to me when he walks in the door is 

<li> Clay - ""there were gonna be some fist fights boy.."" 
<li> Me -  what.. what do ya mean?"" ...
<li> Clay - ""Me and your dad.. almost got in a fist fight""
<li> Me - ""Aaa.. what.. no.. never touch my dad""
<li> Clay - ""No.. you coulda heard the shit he was sayin""
<center>then he starts goin off on his explainations...</center>
<li> Clay - ""Your dad made me look like an ass tonight.. sayin i don't get paid this or that.. and la la..
<li> Me - sittin there takin it all in.. tryin to look at his side.. and thinkin how my dad woulda looked sayin this stuff he said..
<li> Clay - ""Fuck this fuck that.."" (just swearin away.. man.. i hate when he drinks his frickin sick man)

i think he can't control himself at all when he drinks.. especially when it comes to opinions and beliefs.. he gets toooo sensitive over stuff.. and gets defensive easily.. and takes it out.. toooo far..

so im just thinkin about the past crap that went on.. like him coming home one night.. cryin over mom talkin to other men instead of him.. it just makes me think he's just a really jealous baby.. that can't a lot of shit.. and he's gotta be incontrol ALL the time.. to feel secure... 

i dont know though.. i dont know what dad's gonna say about all this.. so i guess i should just shut up and wait.. cause this might just turn out to be one'a those things... who knows though..

clayton just kept saying how our dad isn't a dad.. he doesn't take us fishing.. he doesn't do anything with us.. and just shit that i really wasn't in the mood to hear ... especially from a DRUNK ...

so amanda just freaked out.. ""fuck you clayton.. i fuckin hate you.. get the fuck outta my room"" ... i tried to just keep thing.. peaceful.. and shut it all up.. cause i know everything just got outta place..

so frig man.. clayton didn't take that so good.. stomped to the kitchen.. knocked on mom's door.. yelled at her.. and kept sayin ""good ol' daddio eh? .... yaaaaw.."" just immmature drunky tones... totally not cool..

he kept running in and outside.. probably tryin to get mom's attention.. she locked him outta her room.. i don't blamer.. i feel like he's almost the abusive type.. like he'd hit mom without control...

i dont know.. i just told him straight.. clayton... you're drunk.. you're eyes are blood shot.. and i hate when you're like this.. you seriously freak me out man.. you get really friggin dumb.. and say shit you're gonna regret tomorrow... like shut'r down eh.. frig..

but ya.. he just took off.. outside... smoking.. running.. and burnin off pissyness..

i thought how good this'd be on tape.. so (i know haha) .. but i set the video camera on the friggin dvd stand in the living room.. thinkin he'll be snoozin out on the couch tonight.. but he didn't even come back home.. 15 mins later.. monica and al come pullin in the drive way.. she knocks on our door.. asks for playstation thingamabobs.. and talked to us about clayton.. being a jerk to us and stuff.. and that they found him walkin on the side of the road.. so they picked him up...

man. and he says we're immature and outta control when we drink? ...

just felt like gettin this all out.. im ready to hit some coffee.. and hope mom's okay.. i wonder what today will be like... will it turn out to be one'a those... sorry i want you back type deals or is this gonna be permanent..

that's the question of today... seeeeee ya"

it was pretty fun.. kinda boring if ya focus on the daily shite ya do here.. but good to get a way sorta thing.. we brought a cd player too.. man.. can't live without the tunes.. listened to good ol' tegan and sara.. led zepp.. and more mixable oldies... first day there we just stoked up the lil cabin.. got'r all warm.. and went cruisin on the ice.. cut a hole and got lots of water.. generator copped out the next day.. so had to suffer musicless for a bit.. the whole next day we chopped wood ...more than we should.. wicky wom GOOOD... and finally just relaxed ... made some dinner... had some chung ching noodles n' deer steak.. got the farts.. played some cards.. didn't drink this night... too hard on the tum tum.. the first night was totally drinking and playin cards.. didn't even make'r past 7pm.. i was already out.. and woke up around friggin 1am.. sweatin a pool in my sleepin bag... sick man.. i got top bunk so twice the heatage.. haha.. man.. the stove ran outta wood around 5am.. so amanda stocked'r up.. she didn't know i was peakin. just watchin'r do'r all haha.. good times eh..

so that was our trip.. i woke up around 4am this mornin.. shakin in my gitchies.. i took bottom bunk thinkin i'd have'r all comfy.. but.. dun dun.. ofcourse it changes eh... so i stoked up the stove.. got the heat cranked... went back to bed.. and woke up around 8am.. again.. lil cold.. stove needed wood ... and that's when i just stayed up.. clay and amanda finally just got up.. and we all got ready.. started packin'r up.. and figure we go check the trap we set up lastnight on the lake.. see if we caught anything.. turns out nuttin but mice prints.. so we just kept'r there.. next time we go back to the cab.. maybe somethin'll be there..

so finally took off.. around 10 to 11am... checked and set traps the whole way back to the high way... called bert when we got to the road.. and he picked us up... went straight home.. ate some chung ching noodles with jalapeno's garlic and our spice.. (cant believe we forgot'r on the trip) ... nuts..

i had spice withdrawls man..

but ya.. good to be back and showered up n' fresh.. time to... do somethin.. mom got some mudslide waitin for us on the table.. still thinkin if i should hit'r up or not.. hmm.. hmmm... hm... do i wanna over do'r tonight? or hit the health streak again? ... haha and dr phil was nuts today.. quite the intensity.. about this boy.. being all .. sexual predator on his lil sis... nutssss...

<li>You may have endless ideas streaming through your head, nicole, but little patience to see any of them through to the end. Perhaps you are so busy jumping from one thought to the next that you don't take any of them far enough to know whether they are worthwhile pursuing or not. Write thoughts down as they come to you, and go over them later when your mind is in a quieter state."

the new oven we got a few weeks ago i already told about right? about amanda and dad in one vehicle me and mom in the other.. amanda went over a bump and the oven fell down.. not on the ground but on the side.. i think that's what made'r all screwy and crap.. so ya.. today's the 21st of feb = new oven today = coookies here we come.. and rice krispie squares.. all those lil munchies to bring on tomorrow's big day.. im hopin bert will come over sometime today.. i want him to come with us.. more fun havin him around to bug and screw with.. adds the spice.. 

i just woke up and hit the shreddies.. coffee's turned on and this room's much better than lastnight.. couldn't stand being in'r ... alllll tornado lookin.. messy from britt's lil party when we were gone.. the keyboard and computer desk was sticky with who knows what eh..  thank god brandy will be back to town.. not that it was a bad thing.. just ... whoaa... house of 4 girls is enough to get alll dun dun dun with...  we don't need anymore females..

ohh.. and im gonna watch the L word tonight with amanda.. thought it came on lastnight at 10.. turned out it comes on today.. so im gonna get'r into it.. i keep sayin come on there's destiny 7's in it.. and lots of sag's.. wonder if she'll take it all in... 

but ya.. i'm thinkin about showerin up and gettin all fresh.. maybe take a walk with the sis.. and breathe this fresh ol snowy air in... today's.. definately gonna be one'a those days.. and plus the oven makes it all feel whoaaaaa... focus on the oven babyyyyyyy... rock on!

<big><b>Today's Scope</big></b>

<li> In general, your spirit is upbeat, nicole, freedom loving, and adventuresome. Today, however, you might find that it is a bit more intense and possibly a bit somber, especially when it comes to romantic issues. This approach to matters of the heart isn't exactly your normal style, but you are apt to find that it is appropriate for your situation at this time. Make sure you have the right tool for the job at hand.

<li> Emotional intensity is the name of the game, and there's no other way to play it. You're not prone to this kind of thing, since you love to keep things light, but in this case, you'll want to make an exception."

<i>these days been reelin in the cash.. startin to get the hang of it.</big></i>
<big><small>
me and amanda got called in from our cousin to babysit BABY SITT... as in real baby.. whaa whaa style... never done diapers before.. and man.. actually turned out pretty good... it only cried at midnight then we had to give'r a bottle... sing her a song.. and wait til she rolled over with the thumb in mouth effect...

skylar was great. .he's 4 but knows what he's doin.. i asked him more about the rules of babies.. he just.. smiles nodded and went on with his toys... we watched 101 dalmations and winnie the pooh.. and cooked up some KD and hot dogs and bopped all night... foxy roxy came in about 3 am.. we were out by then... snooooozin away on the couch..

woke up this morning.. figure we just go to church and get a ride out with gramma.. all went swell..

i think im gonna go snow machining now.. but the whole thing started with us goin to town with clay yesterday.. we made $50 each helpin bud dickson with the sports show stuff and painted his frame for the show... man.. i have a good feelin bout money these days.. that and plus the baby sittin cash... 

im savin up for somethin good.. maybe my BREWSTER tattoo.. soon.. i also called candice the other day to see how things were going.. i was actually spose to call'r long time ago.. but somethin about that night felt right.. like a sign of feeling... she told me lots of crap.. about the tegan and sara concert and.. just unbelievable crap. she got to eat with them.. and said a bunch of stuff about us to them.. she said tegan said ""uh oh.. we got competition"".. which is totally off the bonkers nuts man... 

we're goin out to the trap line in a few days to cut more wood and fix up the cabin.. we'll be stayin out there for 2 days.. that and plus fishing and drinking liquor... im layin off the booze though.. we'll just watch clay all day.. and laugh with the fishes..

well .. mom's callin me.. i think she wants to watch ""the village"" right now.. already watched'r in indy.. but come on.. FAMILY TIME.. so im on my way have a goood dayyy..

<big><b>weekly horoscope</big></b>

Your home and family affairs are highlighted this week, nicole, so make the most of this by making your living space a creative place to be. On Monday Venus sextiles Pluto and brings you a chance to earn extra money or close a lucrative deal. You might also meet someone with whom you feel a profound chemistry, even if it is short-lived. It's an interesting day, as long as you don't try to control the outcome too much. Mercury sextiles Mars on Tuesday and encourages you to think up ways to earn money from home or to start a home-based business. The one leads to the other, so see how many great ideas you can come up with. The Full Moon in Virgo on Wednesday highlights your career path and may well put your work in the spotlight for one reason or another - so be sure it brings you the kind of publicity you can be happy about. Don't make any snap career decisions if you feel emotional or out of sorts. The Sun conjuncts Uranus on Friday and may help you to see the light, especially concerning problems at home. Do what you have to and be done with it. You could equally get an unexpected guest on your doorstep. Be nice - they could be angels in disguise."

Also gotta go to gramma's sometime today and make company ham.. maybe we'll do'r before or after we come back from town... no dea' ...

well time to build up some breakfast.. thinkin about coffeein'r and bringin some yogurt to town... spread things out a lil.. 

<big><b>Today's scope</big></b>
<i><big>Better be good, i hope</big></i>

<Li>A family member is about to confide in you, big-time. No worries -- you'll be more than open to hearing their confession. Contrary to popular opinion, you're quite good with secrets, too -- as long as they're not your own. 
    
<li>A female friend whom you haven't seen for a while could surprise you with a phone call or short visit. A lot of interesting news and useful information could be exchanged, benefiting both of you. You may make a number of short journeys throughout the day, nicole, as you have a lot that needs to be done. A small increase in income could also be in the works. In the evening: Rent a romantic video.

[and man.. it better not be who i think it could be.]"

<big><i>woke up this morning with bruises on my bum.. upper leg and lower calf..</big></i>
<small><big>
i swear man.. didn't know it'd turn out so bad.. but i guess things always gotta slip once n' awhile eh.. so me and amanda bought some white rum lastnight.. to build our pina colada crap... ya know have a good time.. smile giggle laugh.. things get slower the more ya gulp and things don't hurt much... like fallin down on the chair and hittin head on floor... (major goose egg right now) ... but ya.. i guess peter was spose to show up at gramma's lastnight.. around 10ish.. turns out mom didnt want us over there all bluntably boozed up and crap.. so when they left to go meet him we were in the mood to do some ... candid camera shottage.. and sneak over and peak through the windows... and snap it up.. and make a lil.. behind the scenes of paula's man.. type thing.. well it went good for awhile until i slipped on a chunk'a ice and hit the side of the house.. everyone in gramma's house peaked outta the window.. and i can already feel the immature thinkage in their heads.. haha.. turns out pete thinks we're 15 yr olds too shy to come in and meet him.. ha.. ofcourse.. eh.. so ya.. we ran home.. tried to beat mom n' clay home before they found out it was us.. but that didn't happen either when we got home.. mom had the tense look of evil eye'age on us.. and we were D-O-N-E. 

so had to sleep'r off.. and work of a good list of chores in the morning.. in the end it was worth it... bruises on the bod = ticklish in the bones.. haha..

it seems like everytime we have fun.. someone's always mad, upset or disafrigginpointed the next day.. then we're suckin thumbs and gotta be all diapered up again.. (immature corn-cobs) will i grow and all that shite? i do but i dont sorta thing.. ya know that feeling? ... man.

im tired.. and ready to much out and watch ""little black book"" then the ""bachorette""

<i>had to get on here and type'r out.. it's gotta mean somethin.. where's my dream book!</i>
<small>
edward furlong was in it.. sometimes he changes into keith gibson... and it'd be him workin in my room.. on a piece of board.. for me and amanda to wake up to.. that said ""welcome back girls.. good to have you again""... but we woke up too soon.. so he felt dumb with it unfinished and him in our room with pieces of art everywhere...

natalie portman was in it too.. i remember her and man.. i liked her.. but kept havin to choose outta her or edward furlong.. i was a lil shmut in the dream.. back n' forth.. from her to eddie.. man.. then sometimes she'd turn into jessica simpson singin on my bed to julia roberts actin intense? what the frig eh? nuttttttty.

then i remember.. me mom amanda and ric friggin kitzul.. drivin our van to town to get the axel fixed... but we crashed.. it wasn't even that big of a crash.. but turned out to be pretty scarishly nuts... we were tryin to stop.. and all these guard rails were pushin us closer to the edge of this cliff thing.. mom kept pumpin the breaks but it wasn't stoppin fast enough.. so we slowly tipped.. and the window's smashed.. amanda and ric almost died.. 

turns out clay had to come and help us tip it back over.. when he saw the accident.. he was laughin cause it looked so cheap and gay.. turns out the scene totally changes.. and it was in my friggin laundry room. and he tipped over the friggin washer.. weird.. (ya know how dreams fade into weirder dreams) somethin like that..

eww and i remember amanda was layin in a bigggg load of meatloaf danno cooked for us.. i woke up to that.. amanda and danno laying in big chunks of meat.. and danno startin up at me.. ""wanna join?"" .. oh man. haha.. amanda said she was only in there cause she was freezin.. but.. man.. she looked guilty..

oh and i remember me and amanda walkin down this longggg narrow hall.. tryin to find our lil sister i think.. and all these chocolates and candies surroundin us.. people from church were there.. warning us ""don't touch those candies"" .. but man.. it was temptin man..

then i remember bein on a dating show.. (probably from watchin friggin dr phil lastnight.. with this dating game on it) all these boys were jumpin over my bed.. these two guys were askin me questions.. and i remmeber feelin confused.. and not understanding.. man..

man.. i wanna dream all of it over again..

But ya.. today's lookin pretty soggy.. i see lots of steam or smoke or.. chilly mist outside.. hmm.. oh ya.. mom told us lastnight before she went to drink at monica's that we should get some rest for tomorrow's big party at pat's.. her and tanna's birthday bash in the garage meanin texas horse shoe tournement with lots of alchohol.. and tomorrow is today.. so hmm.. tonight's gonna be a rough one im guessin..

so it's all about gettin ready for that today.. im sure mom and clay will be hung over today.. i peaked at clay's bottle of whiskey.. he sure drained that one quick..

maybe this means we can do what we want.. when we want.. how we want.. without the squeals today!

if ya try.. you turn out hating yourself in the process..

and by the time you're done.. you're not in the mood...

seriously.. </blockquote><big><b>but ya.. what's been happenin these days..</big></b>

just got outta the tub.. had a long.. hot tub action movie slashin shavity leggin scrubby dub... i still gotta clean'r before mom gets here... today's her second day of work.. perdy sweet.. and tonight's been movie night with everyone again im guessin.. monica, aj, bert and us all watched without a paddle lastnight... it was okay.. im more for the serious one's these days.. also watched the rest of ""closer"" lastnight with the sis.. and watched half of ""ray"" ... now that was gooood.. jamie foxx does awesome in it.. and when he's young.. and turns blind.. his eyes get all cloggy with goo.. makes me wanna pull the strings outta my eyes.. like nuts.. 

all im havin today is cereal and burgers.. shreddies.. man. gotta love the soggy tenderness..

what else is new.. britt's been schoolin'r up these days.. me amanda and clay been havin our scraps but next day the wind's gone.. and all's clear... it's just one'a those strong opinionated arguements.. i can never leave with a positive ending.. always gotta run off with a negative tone.. so im gonna work on my breathers and long walks again.. like i do in the summer..

works like a charm..

ahh.. what else.. we're suppose to get some papers for fire fighting from the ministry.. wonder if mom'll bring'm in today.. hopefully.. somethin to do.. somethin to try.. somethin to risk a lil change.. i guess we could still go to the navy army services.. since it's february... 

but im gettin use to the thought of workin at Tip Top this summer.. im sure the resort's outta the picture now.. we have so much to pay around here now.. the oven.. the stove.. the car is shot.. i guess whatshisface blew the motor.. tony.. man.. mom's gonna go to court and do a trial on that.. hopefully we'll get somethin outta'v'r ... i think we're gettin the van's axel fixed.. it'll cost 2 grand or so.. man. poor mom.. and she's only workin minimum... $7.80 an hour? that's half her normal budget.. or somethin.. 

so.. if we all work at tip top this summer.. it's spose to be some good money.. and good tips.. i guess that leaves workin in the sun still.. as long as im outside.. and with my twin.. im GOOD!

what else.. oh ya.. ""The Notebook"" comes out today.. and monica's goin to thunder bay sometime this week.. wednesday i think.. so i'm gonna see if she can pick me up the dvd.. i'll use my HMV card... $25 ... hopefully she'll be no more than that..

well.. that's all i can think of right now man.. gonna scrub the tub before momma pops in.. and maybe cut up some more garlic for tonight's burger bash... <big><b>peace/piece... of cake?"

The trajectory you shot for yesterday may be running into a couple snags today, nicole. You may find that your dreamy nature is running into conflicts with that which is planned and steady. This conflict of interests may be creating some tension that will be difficult to work with. Your emotions are apt to deceive you today, so try not to get pulled off course by a passing whim. Try to keep your feelings well grounded."

NIGHT!<hr><big><b>Horoscope of the Comin' Week</big></b>

Words of Importance

Talking, communicating, and letting others know you are around is all very important this week, nicole. There is an emphasis on letters, emails and phone calls, and on catching up with any overdue administration or backlog of work. Jupiter continues to move through Libra where it is spicing up your social life and bringing you many chances to meet new people. On Tuesday Jupiter turns retrograde, so if you have met a lot of people, this is your chance to get to know them a bit better and to consolidate the liaison. You may also find yourself backtracking and getting back in touch with people from the past that you haven't heard from in a while. On Wednesday Venus moves into Aquarius, which brings even more delight and sweetness your way, and perhaps the chance of a date or two - if you are really keen. But watch your step on Thursday when the Sun conjuncts Neptune, as one meeting may not turn out to be in your best interests - especially if you rush in where angels fear to tread. Mars continues in your sign until Sunday, so you have until then to make an enthusiastic start on all new projects. After this it will be your personal finances that will be in focus. Get them sorted!"

<big><b>Tonight..</big></b>

seriously was a weird day.. random.. and unhealthy again. crap.

ahh.. woke up.. and felt bored.. mom was bored.. clay was bored.. we were bored..

so we all felt like drinking..

went through moms silver cash.. lots of dimes nickles and pennies.. packaged them up and me and amanda walked to the store... bought 2 bottles of kahlua, one gibson's finest and milk ..oh and smokes for mom and friggin clay eh..

came back.. and drank and played board games all day. good ol' family time.

then took a lil nap..

robert came over.. and woke us up.. i sorta snapped and got psycho.. took me 3 mins to realize i was actually mean... then i felt bad.. but by the time i was feeling bad he was gone.. shite.

ahh.. then we just watched the rest'a manhunt.. haven't watched'r for awhile.. it's a modelling show with guys.. the gay guy robert didn't win.. i wanted him to.. but john's cool...

then i just got on here.. chatted it up.. and looked through some random LJ's of peoples..

came across some good stuff..

<big><B>the life that we live is one that no one can understand, 
the thoughts that we think no one can imagine...


For those who understand, no explanation is necessary. 
For those who don't, none will do.</big></b>

makes me feel comfy and safe for some reason.. 

but ya... im beat.. time to hit the hay.. zZZ"

i watched a good movie this morning called ""tadpole"" about a 15 yr old boy.. crushin on his step mom.. but has an affair with his step mom's friend.. it's more to what it sounds.. it's got quotes and stuff in the middle.. i like how they made it...

and man..

<big><b>what's it mean when ya poop out blood</big></b>

im just gonna be blunt right now but .. sometimes i poop.. and i wipe and theirs lil tinges of blood.. from contipation eh.. but man.. this morning it was like a pool of blood.. sometimes ya gotta squeeze the cheeks just to cut the poop off.. cause it's just too much for the butt eh.. 

i might have hemmroids... seriously.. i never know about this kinda stuff... im not embarrassed or anything it's life eh.. but man.. i just hope it aint.. anal cancer or something haha.. don't feel like dyin anytime soon eh... 

but sometimes .. outta nowhere i'll get this sharp pain in the butt.. and my whole body just stops.. i have to just sit and wait for it to dissolve and go away.. i call that the <big><b>anal pause</big></b>

it's like knives... man.. ouch. 

so ..ya.. lately.. it's been pretty dead around here...

mom went to thunder bay today.. to finally do some shopping... we're really low on the dough still.. it's really diffferent.. thinkin about last year... takin things for granite eh.. things come easy and not really caring.. well.. i sure learned a lil more about life this year.. how things actually cost money.. haha.. i mean frig.. money was never my thing.. but now im sorta thinkin.. well.. maybe i should worry and care more.. i guess i just think of mom.. and see her stress about it all the time.. payin the bills and man.. loans and all them crazy liveable words... im startin to think of her shoes.. and make money for mom...

i dont know exactly when i'll actually grow and do this on my own.. i just know that i like helpin out mom more than myself... 

probably cause it feels more safe.. im just gonna say it.. im not gonna pretend like im all ready to face the world.. a part of me does.. but that's the quick ol glimpse.. ya know.. ya get down deep and detailed.. man.. im still a friggin baby..

so ya.. i just wanna somehow make money.. and get mom all good..

i see dad too.. he's gotta work overtime lots now to catch up.. i think he has to sell his black car ... which is probably smart.. cause man.. he bought so much toys last year to play with .. after him and dawn broke up eh.. he's a free man.. and suddenly turned into this material man.. i dont like it.. i liked when dad had the crappy stuff.. the half broken tail gate on a truck and.. old motor on a boat.. things were much more.. easier and better.. smiley'r... happy.. 

instead of all this good perfect and hot lookin stuff.. makes ya take care of it more ..and think about lookin all good.. it's not as free and fun.. ya know?

so ya.. just thinkin about the past to the now... gotta think about that crap once n' awhile eh.. helps the ol' brain deal with shite now'a days..

it seriously feels like everytime i think about the stuff we really need.. im all happy and excited.. focused and totally motivated to fix it... change it.. and make it all better.. but half way through i'll start feelin depressed.. cause i know i can't just change life in a day... make it all better eh..  and i swear everytime i feel this way i just wanna.. ahhh.. break somethin? cause ya.. ofcourse..  takin'r slow.. living it out day to day.. ease it out and enjoy the things around ya for now is good... but man it just sucks seeing so much pain around ya.. family stressin and stuff.. you can't help but wanna think of ways to make it all better.. and just put'r to a stop.. 

then we'll all just drink... i know that's not good way to end it off either.. but i guess it's the way to just set it aside and.. wait for the days to come? .. ha how depressing.. kinda weak eh..

but again.. it's not as bad as it sounds... 

so ya.. anyway.. my plan today is to burn some good songs..

im really loving <big><b>the killers - mr brightside</big></b> one'a my favorites these days..

and man.. if anyone's got any songs ... please comment eh... we need'r bad.. to motivate life for awhile crank it up in the morning.. and work it up.."

<big><b>im not the best when it comes to telling stories... but what the heck eh..</big></b>
<i><big>it's like one'a those.. in the moment things you can't explain to get the whole feel?</big></i>

sooo.. where do i start... it was me mom and clayton on this trip.. when we finally got to tbay..  and ofcourse... clay does his thing.. goes to the friend's place... crack's up them deals.. like off the movies.. and ya ya ya ya.. lets get on with it.. get to the hotel.. and get this shite all unpacked and do crap... so finally got there.. unpacked... when we got in our room.. everything just suddenly slowed down.. got quiet... and shite.. felt like home again.. so me and amanda hopped in the hot tub and pool for abit.. splashed n' clashed.. giggled n' wiggled... swam with our nates actually haha.. brownie cookies eh... when im in the city i get really imfreakinpatient.. and it's bad.. i just want everything to be just ""go go go"" .. and man.. i just gotta breathe and think.. man.. who's doin this eh.. clay drove.. mom smiled... be appreciative come on already.. so ya.. finally things got all smoothed out.. called eek.. planned to go bowling.. our cousins = sweet eh.. so we all met up.. and bowled our bunions off.. man.. i guttered the first couple times.. but the strikes finally came in during the last couple'a rounds... lil rusty... so ya.. that was done.. dj bowling.. all dark.. flickery lights.. now whatta do.. mom was sittin there with clay and his friend.. sorta knew what was comin next.. me and amanda go with the girls and hang with them.. go to the movies have coffee.. so me amanda erica and heather all popped in a vehicle.. crystal jen the other erica and kate in the other vehicle.. went to the coffee place.. lil girly talkage.. of.. ha'ness... laughed giggled.. moved on to the theater place.. watched the friggin darkness movie ""the darkness"" .. not the best man.. dont' watch it.. it's gay.. so after that was done.. man.. unloaded the blattter poor thing went through lots this trip.. so crystal took us back to the hotel.. all we had on our minds were the left over jalapeno pizza.. we were friggin starved.. so finally got to the hotel.. walkity walk.. to room #101.... 

<li>nicole .. whoa.. whatta night (waiting for amanda to pull out key)
<li>amanda .. ya no kiddin.. (lookin for key in bag)
<li>nicole - dum dee dum (waiting)
<li>amanda - ah.. where is it.. hmm.. (still diggin)
<li>nicole - great.. frig.. (thinkin mom and clay are in there.. now we gotta wake'm up)
<li>amanda - knockity knock...
<li>nicole - no footsteps so far..
<Li>nicole - knock KNOCK KNOCK
<li>nicole - okay..  they're probably still out eh.. duh.. 
<li>amanda - ya.. lets just go see if we can get an extra key at lobbage or what?
<li>nicole - frig ya..

so we go to the deck.. ask the chick thinkin we'll easily just get'r off the bubble eh.. 

<li>nic - we were wonderin if we can get a key for our room.. we forgot our key in the room.. crap..
<li>chick - ahh.. what's your name?
<li>nic - oh.. it should be wilson.. or.. stimson?
<li>chick - ah.. you don't know your own name??
<li>nic - ha.. no.. i mean like.. ya know.. under the room thing.. the thingy.. ya know..
<li>chick - um, no.. we can't just give out keys to people who don't know their own name..

<big>OUCH .. total burnage...</big>

so our next plan was to do the ol' puppy dog effect.. sit on the benches in the lobby.. and act like we're all pooped n'  tired.. waitin for our friggin parents to show.. yaya parents.. we're 19.. and still 12 at the same time.. but ..ya.. a good 5 minutes of that.. i started hatin the bitch i mean.. chick.. she's just doing her job.. and who knows.. i coulda been a killer.. and ya.. she's just doing her job.. good girl right.. (uhhh frick.. shite furikk fushshi) ya.. ahh.. so ya.. i seriously hate waiting.. ha.. man.. so we just started to wonder the halls eh.. get a lil exercise.. talk bout life.. burn time eh.. so.. down the hall there's all these different things.. like restaurant and lil shop then poof.. a bar? ..man.. they got a mini-bar in there eh? ... we peak in.. all amazed and shite.. looked at eachother ""imagine?"" ... haha.. ahhh.. maybe later eh.. who knows.. whatever happens happens.. i mean.. we're old enough now.. they can't do anything to us.. jeez.. la la la.. just talkin about it as we walk... we keep doin circles around the hotel... talking n' talking... then this big guy starts joining our walk.. that's cute eh.. but things just got fishier.. he kept poppin in places we go.. and it took us that long to figure out he was some security guy.. ofcourse he's in on it with this lobby chick... she musta sucked'm in her ways.. gettin him all followin us and crap like we're all bad or somethin.. so ya.. screw them man.. lets just hit the bar.. nothin to lose eh.. so now we're in the hall lookin through our bag for our wallets.. to get our id cards cause we know we'll get carded.. even if we wouldn't get carded.. i was ready to just go up to'm and show'm proof first.. to avoid the stares and weird thinkages of youngish thoughts.. haha.. so ya.. walked in.. and 2 men stopped us.. ya ya.. we look young but i swear.. we're old... that's all we ever say.. but i guess the more we talk the more we sound younger too.. i mean.. who talks like that?.. so finally they saw the 1985 thing.. smiled and told us to have a good time.. ya ya.. sure.. sit down.. laugh and think for a minute.. then head over to the pool table.. and play pool.. there was karaoke on and everything.. i coulda been in the mood.. but ... just played'r safe instead.. so after pool we sat down.. all these men man.. lookin at us like we're lost.. but later on.. we met two actual cool guys.. a destiny 3 and a destiny 7.. we got'r all calculated up eh.. 

<big><b>imagine eh..</big></b>
<li>guy - hey girls (oh ya.. they look easy)
<li>twins - oh hey.. (hmm.. he looks like a leo.. wait maybe a virgo..)
<li>guy - what are you ladies up to tonight? (wanna come to my place?)
<li>twins - ah not much.. just sittin here.. talkin n' crap.. (when's a good time to ask for his birthday)

when it comes to us.. it's like hey.. want a free reading? everything else goes as far as ""so whatcha do for fun?""..crap like that.. some walk.. some walk and say they'll be right back but really don't come back (nicely faded)... then some stay.. but these two guys actually stayed so that was cool.. the one guy was such a destiny 7 too.. the things he said man.. so right.. the destiny 3 kept askin if we wanted to go outside and smoke some weed.. we just kept tellin him.. drink up.. eh.. ha.. in other words.. don't feel like gettin raped today.. jk haha.. so he took off and smoked'r alone.. came back and talked more about life.. moose hunting and somethin about him drilling stuff and gettin chased by wolves.. then about geekin it up online and meetin people across the word.. he was the type that talked and met people too.. so that was cool.. talked about how people think that it's freakish and weird.. after that .. he was more cooler.. so.. sorta made me think.. first time seeing him i was thinking totally opposite of what i thought after talking to him.. so that sorta got me all thinkin and shite.. and.. ya.. looks =  shallow to the core... smack me! so we finally left the bar.. and checked our room again.. see if they got back.. but still no.. so we waited at the lobby again.. got bored.. saw a computer maybe for customers? .. used it ... couldnt get online so we played tic tac toe.. painted on paint.. and finally mom clay and rick showed up.. they were so drunk man.. went to the room... talked to them bout our night.. clay felt so bad.. man.. but man.. no.. things happen for a reason.. = locked outta room = experience difference side of the bar life = opens the mind = good for ya...

so that was cool... nobody was that tired.. we all played cards.. some bettin game.. me and amanda were kickin their butts... went up $20 bucks... but lost it all .. then got'r all back... nuts how gamblin does that to ya... the rush.. and the blindness at the same time... so after that.. mom fell asleep.. clay and rick kept puffin the dragon.. we sat n' waited for awhile... play another round of the betting game... after that.. clay came up with the sweetest.. craziest.. funniest idea... i mean frig.. we were in.. he said he'd go to the front deck.. and pretend one'a us left our ring on one'a the tables in the swimming area... man.. so bad... eh.. he was plannin on.. when the guy opens the door.. he'd somehow turn the notch to stop it from lockin.. so we can swim all night / morning ... and he's good when it comes to the talking part.. see for me.. i'd blow it.. he can actually switch the toning to make it sound believable.. and well.. maybe him being stoned toughens him up? 

so finally..
clay went 

<li>clay - ""hey mam.. would it be possible if you can open up the pool room for me.. my sister left her ring on the table.. and you know girls.. they can't lose their jewelry"" ... (total lie)

i dont know what the chick said.. but all i could see was some fat man goin in a room and jiggly keys in his hands... so he opened'm up...and were out there lookin for the ring.. ha man.. they were out there for along time... clay went in our room grabbed his flashlight.. man.. i couldn't suck it in any longer.. had to plop over and fake sleep.. hide the giggle.. the man yells out ""hey i think i found the ring.."" ... oh man.. that was weird.. but turned out to be a toe nail or somethin.. finally.. the old man called it quits.. said well sorry na na na.. and clay asked well hey.. since im right near my room (pool side room) .. can you open up this door and let me in quick.. fat man said ""sure""... and poof..  opened the side pool door for clay... right when it opened.. clay tried to find the notch.. but it was so quick.. so outta reflex he slips the room key card in the side of the door coverin the frigginnotch thingy.. i didn't believe it at first.. cause man.. nothing like this works for us.. but it friggin did.. the door kept moving too.. i think the man was tryin to figet with the door to hear the click..  it finally stopped.. and we peaked out the window and the man left the pool area place... we were innnn man.. man.. so we got our trunks on. this was about.. 2:30am.. ofcourse this has to happen.. right when we're ready to friggin go in the pool... some other man pops in... with towels and shite... he kept walkin back n' forth.. then started puttin chemicals in the pool.. swear to god.. we were up til' 5am.. waitin for this guy to leave.. so finally ....he leaves.... we're goin for our 3rd kill.. this is gonna be it this time.. believe it or friggin now.. the WINDEXING lady pops in now.. who cleans windows at 5 am ?? jeeeez.. so ya.. time goes by... gettin tired by the minute.. man.. everything just got slower.. i was almost past out when clayton finally says.. okay we can finally go now.. this was probably 6:30am now? ... so we finally took a quick peak to the whirl pool section.. checked if she was hot.. and it wasn't even filled or nothing.. all that waitin for nuttin haha.. so we laughed.. and went to bed..

<big><b>i swear.. all that trying leaves ya crying.. but in the end... it's all exercise... 

with big bags under the eyes in the morning...  </big></b>

oh ya.. and the whole point of goin to thunder bay was to pick up this weight thing.. workout bench multi-thingy... and turns out we didn't get that.. oh ya.. and the smaller labrets.. didn't get those.. what else... 

see ... that's what i mean about life of the unplanned whatever happens happens.. flow..

man.. i feel sick ..and tired.. and energetic at the same time... i wanna drink and pass out.. but i dont wanna drink and be all unhealthy.. wholey.."

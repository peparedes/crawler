"event","*ahem* Guitar hero is an insult to people world-wide who actually play guitar, it's fucking DDR with a stupid controller that makes you think you look all cool ""look mom, I'm playing guitar"" it's such a fucking let down, guitar is more than holding down a couple buttons and flicking a fucking switch back and forth.

guitar hero teaches you nothing about the guitar, I mean, I'm sure you look great, sitting there with your miniature plastic guitar controller, jamming out with whoever-the-fuck it is you jam out with on that unholy hunk of shit, but I look so much cooler with my REAL guitar, playing REAL fucking music which REAL people can enjoy.

it's kinda like those sickos who manually masturbate caged animals for the purpose of saving the species, just put two in a cage together and they'd do it themselves, but no, people always have to think of a more complicated way to do things.

So, before you shell out real money for a fake guitar, just think about how dumb you look, like whacking off a Llama in a cage bitches, seriously guys, it's retarded, you could buy a cheap guitar with the money you would've spent on a video game which pretty much tells you ""hey, you have no talent, you know this, you'll never be really good at this instrument, but thanks to us you can fake it"" 

BUY A FUCKING GUITAR!!!!

seriously, if I haven't put it into perspective for you which would you rather buy? A dildo/fake pussy? or real sex? sure, the dildo is safer, but real sex is better

so what if you suck at first? you'll get better, with that stupid ass video game all you're going to do is develop carpal tunnel and be in severe pain for the rest of your life"

I saw wendy's brother at the 24 hour convenience store, he apparently works there now, it was somewhat nice to see him, he seemed to be about as upset about her moving to knoxville as I am.  Don't get me wrong, I don't care what she does with her life, but she's sort of carrying about my unborn child wherever she goes so...yeah, that makes me give a bit more of a fuck.

see, I have all these thoughts running about, my mind is a train wreck of thoughts, ideas, feelings, emotions, and all that jazz

I need a vacation so badly, I need to get out of this part of life for at least a day or three

my former sanctuary has been defiled, I'm on the mountain now, which offers some comfort, just to see everyone here keepin' on keepin' on makes me feel better and I must say it's much easier to focus my mind here but the thoughts still run rampant

thoughts of you, thoughts of me, thoughts of lives I've touched or have yet to touch.

thoughts of stories I've read...fiction is such a sweet escape from this mortal coil.

I think fiction has warped my brain in some way, I feel as if I strive for things which are unattainable.  Everyone wants a perfect life right? not me, I'd be happy with a few things, my friends, my family, my guitar, and my lover

I love life, I love living, as a matter of fact it's one of my favorite things to do.  Every morning I walk outside, take a breath of fresh air, and enjoy all the life around me.  Life is good, sure we all say ""life sucks"" every now and again from time to time but if I really believed that I would simply stop living.

I have come to the conclusion that my life is...not where I want it to be right now, and I am in the process of changing that.  I'm getting my GED soon, and a job along with it, and with the two of those a ticket out of duffield.  I don't want to go far, perhaps kingsport or Johnson City or someplace close but not too close.

Getting a job and moving simply won't do as far as getting my life in order goes, I have about a million different things to take care of here and there and I plan to take care of them as soon as possible.

No real point ot any of this, just recording random thoughts and goals so that I can either congratulate or kick myself later on.

I shall have strength, I shall weather the storm, for the waters that lie ahead shall be much more calm than those I traverse now.

I wrote many thoughts into my actual journal last night, and I sat in prayer and meditation for a long time, I also read my runes.  Through my runes I discover truth, the Lord and Lady give me these truths, but I must interpret them...I fear some of the answers I have been given, some of the things that were shown to me last night, but I also look forward to these events passing, for I shall come out stronger, wiser, and more prepared for what lies ahead.

I feel as if I should say more, or perhaps there is more that I have to say except I don't know how to say it.

I want to finish by thanking the both of you, you know who you are for the two of you know me better than anyone ever has, I love you both and I hope you are ever a part of my life"

Don't get me wrong, living a life with as many unexpected twists and turns as mine is great fun, it really is like a box of chocolates.

Courtney really has a way of making one step out of their own reality and view it is if it's a friday night sitcom where you're free to judge the main character (yourself) and the rest of the cast.  She really showed me a lot of things, I am adjusting my behavior accordingly :)

But, you see, she has done little to dissuade me from pursuing my chosen path, just helped me see the path a bit more clearly.  She made a lot of sense


Everything makes more sense (less sense) these days, and it seems, and I'm surely being optimistic here, that things are beginning to tie themselves together as I approach the new year.

I've also realized that I may be pushing myself too far.  I often step back and look at things saying 'I know there's more I can do here'  but now, I can also say 'There's nothing more I can do'  or 'I could do more, but it would make things harder on myself or others'

I learn something new every single day, and that's exactly how I like it.

I don't consider myself stuck, simply delayed for a bit, I hate running conversations over and over in my mind which I've not even had yet.

I had another strange dream last night, I was roaming around most of the time, one of those dreams in which you really can't tell where you are, and I met a few people, one in particular, which I have abandoned for one reason or another.  This person, whom I care for deeply, abandoned me in the dream, left me crying and upset and basically cut me away like I was nothing to them. I don't remember much else, I awoke in a cold sweat before the dream could go any further.  I felt the deepest remorse, even deeper than I had felt before, after I thought about it awhile, and I have to wonder what it all means.

the other night I dreamed I was outside at Nan and Grandad's house and I saw footprints in the grass, they were human footprints but where the foot had touched the ground the grass was black and dead, while around the footprints all the grass was yellow and wilted.  This dream had a strange vibe to it, I didn't wake up sad as I usaully do but just neutral, not that I didn't feel anything, it frightened me yet I was scared if that makes sense.

I also keep having this dream bout a flood, I'm in the passenger seat of a car when it is happening and before last night I usaully ended up going over this bridge with the flooding brown waters churning below and suddenly there is no more bridge and we're underwater, but last night we simply drove to the side and stopped at the old 50's style diner, the ones with the windows all arounf and watched people rebuild the bridge...

"event","damn I'm tired...today was the first day of college...I was up at 7:00...which is 5 hours earlier than early to me, and after college me and my Cyndi went and visited some friends.  It was a good day.  It's also good that I'm tired so I might actually fall aslep tonight...need rest...

I got to spend pretty much all day with my baby...makes me very very very very happy...but of course, she always does.  I love you Cyndi.

John's gonna let me burn a copy of his castlevania game for the ps1...I've never even seen it before...I forgot the name but it's supposedly very rare...yadda...

so yup, that's what's going on in my life today...

"event","yup, life's pretty good when you're me.  Not to brag or anything but the past little span in the not-so-boring life of Kelly has been alright.  I have the most wondeful girlfriend in the world, as anyone could probably tell by seeing us togetehr or reading our little notes back and forth to each other.  I've gotten in touch with an old friend, namely Bert, he came up here twice over the last week and hung out.  Bert's a true friend, I realized this the otehr night when he and I were discussing 'soul seraching' which is a concept he grasps as well as I.  I've also gotten into some of my older PS1 games in my more bored times, I played all the way through Medievil and beat it, got everything, best ending and all that...and now i must wonder what the next week has in store for me...

It's good to be back home again..."

"event","I watched the first DBGT video last night, I borrowed it from my Cyndi.  It's a pretty kickass series despite the fact that Goku's a kid again...weird.  Pan seems to be a useless saiyan...I don't think she even goes Super-saiyan in the series, they shoulda brought Vegeta or someone...maybe Tien or Piccollo instead of Pan *shrugs* she's like the new Krillin, except without the senzu beans.

But enough of this, I miss my baby, time to talk to her. I love you Cyndi

Bye kids!"

"event","this weekend was pretty cool, I went to D and Coy's new place friday and partied and all that, but then Mcfarland came by, and I asked him for a ride on saturday when he came through, he said he'd pick me up...but he never showed, he's gonna pay.

Anyways, saturday I sat around waiting on Mcfarland and playing Yu-gi-oh.  I was worried about Cyndi, I figured she'd be worried about me, I was right but I made it up to her...

...on Sunday, today, when I came home and then went and picked her up and rode around for awhile.  We went to devil's fork, looked at a couple cemetaries, then went to Hardee's for food, then went to Duffield primary and played on the swings.  Today was by far the best day I've had in a looooooong time, I love being around Cyndi so much it kinda scares me sometimes, but I like it..."

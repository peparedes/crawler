"event","<P><EM>am i still mad? is that honestly all you have to fucking say? i went into 7th period today practically in tears. you screwed me the fuck over and dont even care. yes im still mad. ask me in a month and youll still have the same answer. i dont even want to think about you. i hate you. how can you set me up, promise me youll never do that to me then that very next day talk shit about me to your friends that already dont like me? you were so fucking worried about me hurting you all along and it was because you didnt want me to do to you what you were doing to me. you lied. you were wrong to do what you did and you know it, yet you dont even care, and all you have to say for yourself is "" still mad?"" obviously im still mad. you have no idea what was going on in my head saturday night, not one clue, yet you act like i purposely ruined the night, like i wanted to have a terrible time. then you went on to lie to all your little friends about it. that was wrong, beyond wrong. i trusted you. i believed you. and all that for what? just to get torn apart? thats not what i wanted, not what i expected or even saw coming. thats far from what i thought would happen. i gave up some one, some one that honestly cared and meant the things he said. some one who didnt plan on screwing me over. some one who told me they loved me and actually cared. some one who was there when i was upset and having a bad night. i gave that some one all up for you. that was one of the biggest mistakes ive made. i regret it more than anything. i asked you what you were doing last night and you said "" laying in bed wishing you were here ""&nbsp; that was about an hour after you sat around talking shit about me. do you not feel guilty about that at all? i dont even understand anymore. all i know is that i want you to stay away from me. dont call me. dont text me. nothing. forget about me. it cant be hard.</EM></P>

"event","<P><EM>alright so i got tired of the other&nbsp;journal, now im going to give this one a try.</EM></P>
<P><EM>umm yeah, friday i hung out with patrick, we went to the barn to feed, spencers house, needvile (for no reason at all) and rosenburg (once again for no reason at all) then i came home cause i had to be here by 11 seeing as my mom thought i was lieing about who i was with, she thought i was with mikey. but yeah i wasnt with mikey cause im not even going out with him anymore. she seems to think im lieing about that one too but im not.</EM></P>
<P><EM>saturday i went to the barn and fed, then i sat around the house most of the day. then my sister and david took me to chick-fil-a for lunch before they went to Niko Niko's (a greek restraunt).&nbsp; after a while justin got done working or what ever so i went back to the barn, fed again, then came home and played with my cousin and brothers ducks. then justin came and got me and we drove around a bit, then we went to Jillians in the mall. i was in a not so good mood the whole time though, and that not so good mood got him mad at me cause i said something i shouldnt have said.</EM></P>
<P><EM>now its sunday and i just got home from the barn. i pissed Justin off quite a bit, not intentionally though. i mean if you had heard the things hes done it would make you worry a bit also. i understand that there is a limit to how much i worry about it, but every time i talk to some one about him they tell me hes going to screw me over no matter how much i look out for it. so this morning i was texting him and i asked him about it once again and then he blew up on me. i wont get into what he said but yeah. i really do understand what he meant though, im sure if he asked me the same question over and over id get mad. i dont think id say what he said but i know id get frustrated. i guess the fact that he treats me so much different than mikey and other people i wont get into is what makes me worry so much. i mean i feel like i have more too lose, liek i actually have to hold on and work for this one. mikey was so determined to make things work that he couldnt get mad at me. even when i told him about justin and about that night at erins and everything, he didnt get mad or care at all. i dont know if that meant that he never cared in the first place or if it meant he didnt want to loose what he had so he kept the anger in.i dont care about that anymore though. its just that, i dont know, its different. i havent figured out why i wrap myself up into little things that are going to be gone in no time at all. </EM></P>
<P><EM>but on a lighter note, schools almost out, meaning i will soon be spending my days at my aunt and uncles house watching my cousin from 7:30 - 5:00 every week day, well starting next monday. its not going to be too bad though cause brandon lives behind her and he has a little sister thats like best friends with elisa (my cousin) so ill deffinately be spending my time over there. oh, and gar bear is moving soon. hes going to live a 5 minute walk away from me, which is pretty exciting seeing as hes my best friend. well not so much anymore but we can fix that. i havent hung out with him in so long. i miss him. once we get a week or two into summer im starting my room. im painting it, doing a new border, new bed frame and everything else. my dad told me i should be a deffense attorney, it got me thinking. right now im set on being an interior designer, but he doesnt have a bad idea. i dont know what i want to do yet. </EM></P>
<P><EM>im now going to go clean a bit and get ready for the day. i think jello and i are going to hang out, im not quite sure though. i guess it just depends on when she calls and what im doing at the time.</EM></P>
<P><EM>&lt;3 Lo</EM></P>"

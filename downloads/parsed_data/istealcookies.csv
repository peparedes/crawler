"event","<lj user=""vivahate""> is in town and last night on the way back from <a href=""http://www.mixtophilly.com/"">margaritas, plantains, and some ricockulously awesome cuban desserts, </a>we stumbled upon approximately 200 billion flood lights and miles of electronic cords wrappings around the block i live on.  plus, trucks with the Paramount logo.

it was pretty clear some big production was taking place; i had seen the cords around my building for 2 days but had no idea what for...well guys, it was for the BEOUF (can i call him 'the beouf' please and thank you).  and no i didn't see his smarmy young ass nor did i care too, but i did get to catch a glimpse of my back alleyway being morphed into ""France.""  there was smoke (or dry ice? unsure) emanating in large quantities from behind fake dumpsters with french grafitti on them.  my fave had a little grafitti robot and said ""LES THUGS.""  tessa took pics with her crazy awesome camera that even makes a half-eaten piece of toast look like it's in a shot for <i>Gourmet.</i>

we made ""pals"" with some old dude that worked on set and he let us past the barricades to glimpse the end of the shooting.  there were at least 6 major cameras on wheels doing their thing.  apparently a giant transformer was somewhere in the alley, but i couldn't see with all the floodlights what was happening.  all i saw was that my building had a sign saying ""Ecole Militaire"" (military school) and even the bridal shop at the corner had a fake awning to make it French.  

i didn't see Transformers I, nor do i care to, but now i want to see <i>Part Deux</i> just to see my building and you know, les thugs.  ok fine, i'll probably just rent the dvd 3 years from now if i can remember to care at all.

very unexpected and strange ending to the night! GO BEOUF GO.

"event","i'm really effin annoyed.
when you have an issue with a friend, or you're mad at them, the most proactive thing to do is to talk about it.  at least if you give two shits about them.  and i would assume you give <i>at least</i> one shit if you've hung out with them on a bi- to tri-weekly basis for about 3 months and told them all your innermost, girly secrets.

but maybe that's just me.  maybe other people out there can share their time and their feelings and their secrets at the drop of a hat with just about....anybody?  

when you're 12, confronting a friend with an issue may not seem like a reasonable thing to do.  hell, what 12 year old is looking for reason?  you just want to ride your 10-speed and crush on the spiked-hair douchebag behind you in math class.  you don't need any drama beyond who-kissed-who at samantha rosenberg's bat mitzvah.


but i would think, after oh i don't know, 21, 25 years of age...that if you invest time with someone then you can at least have the balls to tell them if/why you're mad at them.  even if you don't want to be their friend anymore you can say ""hey, you did this, and i'm not cool with it....later.""  as opposed to pretending they don't exist.  especially if they are trying to extend a fucking olive branch.


so yea, what the hell am i talking about.  i'm talking about my so-called first ""best friend"" in Philly.  who i've spend countless hours with and bought food and beer for just because i considered her a worthy person.  and now i'm being ignored and i'm not sure why.  because i didn't want to walk around nyc for hours this past weekend when i could barely walk to the bathroom due to a back injury?  shit.  i don't know.  i'm <i>constantly</i> amazed at the immaturity and lack of compassion of the seemingly intelligent adults i know.
boys issues are hard enough.  i don't need shit from people who i consider my friends.<br><br><br><br>"

"event","well the past few days have sucked (minus cut copy on friday, the news that <lj user=""dehumidifier""> is visiting still, and <lj user=""pettybooka"">'s amazing health guidance).

i got a letter dated may 12 telling me that i would get my economic stimulus payment around the 16th.  i was wary because my entire tax return went to my student loans debts...but well then, the letter came.  plus it made sense to me that i would get it if its goal was to you know, <i>go back into the economy</i>, as opposed to back to the government or to pay off loans. 

so i paid off all my bills ahead of time, bought people bday gifts and thank you gifts and did extra food shopping and apartment shopping and errand shopping, etc etc.  all the while thinking, yay, my check is coming and i am finally getting some much-needed things paid for!  WELL LO AND BEHOLD, today i get another letter saying that my $600 <i>also</i> went to my student loans, which by the way, i am <i>paying off every month</i>.  more than 400 every month!  what the hell do they want from me?!  

so thank you government.  if you're going to screw me over, can you at least not <i>trick</i> me first? that's all i friggin ask. can you at least not do <i>surprize buttsecks</i> on me, government???? jeez.

in other suckage news, the slipped disc in my back is worse than ever. i had to <i>crawl</i> to the bathroom on saturday because i couldn't walk.  also, my first good gal pal here in philly has decided to ignore me because i didn't want to go to nyc with her on saturday.....which was also because of my back.  granted, i was passed out and i think she had been waiting for my answer which was rude of me, but i'm pretty sure it's not too cool to ignore me in return, and then take me off her myspace tops bullshit.  what is this, kindergarten?

well i'll say this much.  this week has got to get better.  at least <lj user=""dehumidifier""> can come visit now that she got her 'stimulus' check.  i'm going to go bury my head in a pillow and watch some dvds and turn on mah heating pad and hopefully pass out.<br><br><br><br>"

we went out to Olde City on friday, which is sorta douchey; like it used to be cool but then some of the yuppie new jersey peeps took over.  it still has some interesting bars and nice restaurants though.  we only went there  because a friend of hers had to interview some band that was playing. it was fun; the band was sorta akron-family-ish but sans ukulele, it would've just been semi-bland pop.

last night we went to a club called the Barbary that i've been meaning to go to.  it was fun to dance again...it's been a while.  it was the 10th anniversary of a party called Sorted that's mostly britpop and late 90s style....it was MEGA CROWDED.  loads of cute hipster-y guys, ladies....i got asked out by a guy i had met on douchespace but he seemed pretty wasted; i highly doubt he'll even remember that we met!

anyways, i'm really happy i'm meeting some people outside of work and i'm realizing there is quite a bit to do here.  by the way, has anybody seen Baby Mama?  i love tina fey but i haven't seemingly gone to the movies in forever.  apparently it takes place in philly...<br><br><br>"

so now i am slightly bummed but also relieved.  i hate having bad blood with someone out there, already, in what is a new and exciting city for me.  but i'm trying to focus on the new and exciting as opposed to the 'bad blood' aspect.  also, regardless of this dude not being right for me, i do realize i have a lot of anger inside that i need to deal with.....anger that comes out when crappy dudes (or even friends) do or say something that rubs me the wrong way.  i'd like to get a stupid self-help book and/or therapy...though i really don't have money or time for the latter....any thoughts?

i feel like a loon.  a relieved loon, but a loon nonetheless.




on a positive note, one of my bffs, whom i haven't seen in a couple years, is coming into town tonight from nyc.  she has an engagement brunch or something ghey tomorrow morning, but tonight we can hang out.   i am waaaaay excited to see her.  too bad i still haven't found my goddamn camera charger.


oh, also, i finally met and hung out with <lj user=""practicecactus""> last night.  we went to a bar called Good Dog that has <i>amazing</i> food.  i cannot stress how good the ""bar"" food is in philly.  i had mac n cheese with crushed cornflakes on top and a blueberry muffin side."

it's not the least caloric of frozen yogurts out there, but the mild honey taste and the granola bits make it well worth it for me.*

"event","well i know everyone's hangovers are different...but for the past few years, i tend to get nauseous really easily, with a wonderful headache to boot.  usually the only thing that gets rid of my headaches is excedrin, but if i take that while feeling nauseated, i will throw up.  

so yesterday i forced down a granola bar, some vitamin water, and more regular water, all the while trying not to throw up.  then i quickly took some <a href=""http://www.brands2liveby.com/product.aspx?id=407"">emetrol</a> to make sure i would keep this down.  then the excedrin..... emetrol is awesome, it really does stop the nausea.  there are definitely times when you need to throw up but it's good when you are just dry heaving and need to stop.

within an hour, the emetrol allowed the excedrin to work and i felt brand-new again and was able to start really rehydrating myself.


woo hooo.


now if only i could keep myself to a 2-3 drink minimum so as to avoid creating hangovers in the first place!"

so much has happened i've barely had a chance to breathe....
i love my coworkers so far and i've made some friends, but i definitely
don't know anyone well enough to get really excited about it.
i'm supposed to hang out with a friend-of-a-friend, removed, sometime this week.
i started ""seeing"" (what kind-of archaic term is that anyways)
a guy that i met at the Addy awards, which my coworkers had invited me to.
he works at one of our many agency offices, so he's technically not a coworker.
he's already giving me mixed messages.  what is it with you guys anyways, tell
it like it is, jesus.

i was sick all weekend.  but i have many adventures lined up, mostly involving 
old pubs and museums.  possibly a little ben franklin and and maybe a veggie
cheesesteak.  oh yea, and shopping.  there is plentiful shopping in my 'hood.

oh and suzan is coming for a show next week, maybe i can go dance with her.  
and taylor is going to visit tentatively next month sometime.  everybody, come
visit me....i need partners in crime!

"event","<b>you. yea you.</b>  i know you're reading this because i know how narcissistic you are.
and even though i haven't posted in a while, i'm pretty sure you'll check to see if i have.
just please know i am saying this more for my own mental cleansing than for your sick self-indulgence.

first off, 
i may be many things.  i may have many flaws.  i can be cruel and rude and bitchy.
i am easily angered.  i cannot tolerate disloyalty among close friends.
but i am not a liar.  i will absolutely obligate myself to tell the truth. and if you ask me about it i will answer you plainly.

everything i said to you was forthright.
anything he relayed to you...well if it bothered you, you should have questioned me about it
instead of simply believing him.  hell i don't even know what i'm working with here. did i possibly say a few negative comments about you behind closed doors? why yes i did. i'm entitled to my own opinions. but i'm more than positive what i said has been grossly
distorted by that putrid little jerk-off.

and the fact that he would pass on such comments to you, ,when they were said in privacy and had no bearing on my liking or respect for you as a person just proves how lowdown and dirty he is willing to get to make a strike against ME.....at YOUR expense.  he didn't care to spare your feelings to get his way. i'm not sure what you heard but i can only say that my statements  were <i>quite frankly</i>, said en masse.  i am one of like 8 billion people on the internet whom you continually bombard with your half-naked pictures and fake modeling ""photography"" gigs.  i never disliked you, but it's still fucking annoying to chance upon your conceited posts.  trust me, i'm not the only one who feels this way.  in fact, the man with the small phallus had a few cruel comments of his own.

i have done nothing or said anything to regret.  


to all others:
i am back.  i need to vent.
i have had it up to HERE with Vegas.  especially Las Vegans of the opposite sex.  
i have never met so many horrible attention-hungry vapid people in my life.  los angeles hasn't proved to be much better, ahem.
i am SO glad i have taken a new job and Philly and will be there soon.  good bye to this 
hellhole of a city forever.  i hope my few true friends that remain behind will find a way to 
a better city eventually as well.

and taylor, if you're reading this....i doubt i can go to LA before i leave (the 15th) because next weekend will be my last here.  you are more than welcome to come stay with me however.  you have turned out to be a true friend and i am glad our former dramas are over.  
drama past 25 is just not....necessary!"

i blame this all on either A) my dad, who had L5 vertebrae herniation and may have passed on to me and B) Candace FUCKING Goodwin...the girl who pummeled me to the concrete ground a few years back (the first signs of back pain started a week after).  now the pain resurfaces every year....progressively worsening....maybe they are in cohorts to make me quadraplegic.  

anyways, i saw my first orthopedic surgeon today who gave me tons of drugs (<i>hallelujah</i>) and told me i need an MRI.  so i guess i will have to go on from there.  i am not allowed to exercise, which makes sense but sucks because i have been laying on my ass all weekend (save for one dinner and one bar-capade, where i also mostly sat on my ass).  i feel like a lump of coal.  i'm going to be left in naughty kids' stockings this xmas.

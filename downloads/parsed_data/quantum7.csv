"event","<p>I was recently directed to this interesting <a href=""http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/networking/2008-ccs-spamalytics.pdf"">paper on spam emails</a>. In it Stefan Savage (who was at UW today but I missed him) et. al relate how they hacked a spam bot net. They give an interesting technical description of spam nets, which I found surprisingly sophisticated. But here's the real meat of their findings:</p><ul> <li>~25% of spams reach valid email addresses. Most of these end up in spam boxes, of course.</li> <li>3.5e-3% of spams sent are clicked on. Most people are smart enough to avoid it, but that's still 17000 clicks per month.</li> <li>Only 8e-8% of spams (28 insecure men) sent resulted in purchases of fake pharmaceuticals, so there's not a huge amount of profit involved. Of course, sending email from a botnet is basically free.</li> <li>However, a much higher 3e-4% of people managed to get themselves infected, so the network is hard to shut down completely.</li> <li>Hotmail seems to have the most aggressive spam filters. Not a single message got through in the study.</li>  Data was based on about 470 million spams sent over about a month, which is only a small fraction of what the Storm botnet sends.<p>&nbsp;</p></ul>"

"event","After my old computer died, one of my big goals was to recover all my music and photo metadata. For photos this was easy, since iPhoto stores it in the same place as the photos, on my external hd. For music it was trickier. I still had the music files from my external, but I had lost the xml file iTunes stores my ratings and playcounts in. Fortunately I had all that info on my iPod, which I was able to recover via a script. <p>Here's what worked for me:<br />Note that I was using Mac OS 10.5 and my iPod is formatted as HFS+.</p><strong>1. Copy data from external HD</strong><br />Open iTunes and let it create a new library on the new computer.<br />Enable the 'Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder when adding to Library' option from the preferences. This will make ITunes leave the external hd untouched as a backup.<br /> Added the folder on my external hd containing my music.<br /><br />I was surprised how much information iTunes was able to get by itself. I've always used the 'Keep iTunes Music Folder organized' option, so It was able to get all the Title/Artist info right. It even added my podcasts correctly.<br /><br /><strong>2. Fill in holes from iPod</strong><br />If any (or all) of your music was not on the external hd but it is on your iPod, copy that data.<br /><br />Download <a href=""http://fadingred.org/senuti/"">Senuti</a>. This is a very well written app for recovering music from the iPod.<br />Without the iPod connected, open iTunes<br />Hold down <strong>Command+Option</strong>, then plug in your iPod. This keeps iTunes from syncing with the iPod<br />Enable disk use on the iPod<br />Run Senuti<br /><br />Senuti will restore any songs you don't have in iTunes, along with all their metadata.<br /><br /><strong>3. Copy metadata</strong><br />Songs copied from the hard drive will not have ratings or other metadata, but you can copy that from your iPod. <a href=""http://dougscripts.com/itunes/"">Doug's Scripts </a>is a great place to find useful applescripts for iTunes.<br /><br />To copy ratings, playcounts, comments, and date last played, use the script <a href=""http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=synchipoditunesdata"">Synch iPod-iTunes Data</a>.<br />To copy playlists, use the script <a href=""http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=mirroripodplaylists"">Mirror iPod Playlists in iTunes</a>. Unfortunately there is no way to recover smart playlists, since the criteria for these are not stored on the iPod. You can force the mirror script to copy over smart playlists to iTunes as normal playlists by editing the script and commenting out (adding &quot;--&quot;) to the line &quot;--if smart of item pl of thePLs is false then&quot; and its corresponding &quot;end if&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","...but my computer's not. The hard drive was angry so I threw it in the big red incinerator. It gets no cake.

But the lack of blogs is because I've been busy! June and July was a flurry of travel. Then after I got back I started working in Don Hilvert's biochem lab. August was spent pipetting half the days and then studying diligently (mostly thanks to aforementioned lack of computer) while I waited for the cells to grow. Now I've finally made it through the gauntlet of exams, just in time to start packing.

The lab is interesting. My project isn't particularly inspiring (its only 5 weeks after all) but it does employ a wide variety of techniques, so I'm getting a good feel for what it would be like to do biotech on a daily basis, which was my goal in taking this job. It does require more planning and thought than lab classes I've taken, where they give you the protocols for everything in advance. That makes it more attractive to me than my previous experiences, but I'm still not sure that I have the temperament to be a molecular biologist. You need to be really meticulous and patient, since results come so far down the road.

For my project I slightly modified a protein that my supervisor/colleague, Rebecca, is using for her doctorate thesis. The protein works in E. coli, but the yeast form is slightly different and isn't active. We thought the problem might be a tag on one end which was used to label the protein. So I cut out the section of DNA that encoded the tag and then put everything back together. Of course I had to do a lot of checks to make sure all the steps worked correctly, and at several steps I had to wait for E. coli or yeast to grow. Still, it's a little depressing to me that my summer's work can be summed up in one sentence. One thing that surprised me is how routine most of the techniques I've learned in class are. For instance, genome sequencing still gets into the press occasionally, but last week I sequenced over four kilobases with about half a day's work. That's nearly as much as the first whole genome sequenced."

"event","<p>By chance I rediscovered a book I read at age ten or twelve. It made a lasting impression on me at the time because it has some really dark themes which were way too mature for a fifth grader. The surprising thing was how much the book had changed in my memory. Some scenes I recalled in precise detail, but had them totally wrong chronologically. In others I had transposed characters, or changed the setting entirely. For instance, in one section they are trying to cross a magic barrier. I remember much of the struggle, but in my memory it took place in the more mundane setting of a mountain pass. It is funny how we modify memories over time.</p>

<p>I'm currently taking a lab course in biotechnology. This year the class is focusing on biotech in mammalian cells. Today we had a trip to a world leader in mammalian culture, <a href=""http://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com"">Boehringer Ingelheim</a> in <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps/mm?ie=UTF8&hl=en&ll=48.113406,9.796844&spn=0.007092,0.017338&t=h&z=16&msa=0&msid=103476452433461588517.00000113568f9f25cf49a"">Biberach, Germany</a>. This is one of the biggest manufacturers of biological pharmaceuticals (read antibodies) in the world. Basically, they start with cells which produce a particular drug, usually in hamster cell cultures in a test tube. They then grow the cells up from a single clone to huge 12000 L tanks three stories tall, then extract the antibodies secreted by the cells. Everyone complains about drug costs, but after seeing this facility I can understand the price a bit more. The design of processes to produce drugs is truly a feat of human ingenuity, and the measures needed to implement the technology are extreme.
</p><p>
The day started with lovely drive through rural Switzerland and southern Germany, including a ferry across Lake Constance. After driving through beautiful vineyards and orchards we reached their sprawling campus. I was never that interested in pharmaceutical companies, but now I understand the appeal. The campus is impressive - nice architecture, plenty of trees, and huge. The cafeteria food was good and we were served coffee afterwards as we sat and chatted. The labs were spacious, light, and ultramodern. Money is not a consideration - whatever is needed to make the deadlines and quality standards is implemented. The flip side of this is that jobs there are secure and a bit static. Most of the people grew up in southern Germany and there doesn't seem to be that much international mixing within Boehringer. Overall, it struck me as a good place to go after you have kids and want to settle down, not a hip, lively biotech firm.
</p><p>
The biggest problem facing their antibody production is contamination. Since they are amplifying the cells something like a billion fold, the smallest bit of contamination ruins the whole project. FDA rules force them to keep a very close eye on possibilities for bacteria or especially viruses to enter the cells, since they would eventually show up in patients. To solve this problem they have automated almost all their procedures, so that humans never have contact with the cells. Computers control all the things needed for cell growth - nutrients, air, pH, etc. It is amazing how different their facilities feel from the university's, where human involvement is constant and time is often sacrificed to save money.

The scale of the reactions was constantly bewildering. In our lab we consider a process to be pretty big if you can measure it in milliliters rather than using the usual micropipettes. At Boehringer they have to use exponential notation for some of their measurements! They have chromatography columns two meters wide and ""glassware"" I could barely cover with my whole hand. Protein isn't produced all that fast - think about how slow your hair grows - but they can produce a years supply of some of their drugs in just two weeks. And as they churn this stuff out they still find time to sit at the cutting edge of research into ways to improve the process.

<p>For Niklas's birthday last week we went to see the circus, <a href=""http://www.knie.ch/"">KNIE</a>. This is a traditional circus with a big tent and a dirt ring. The only circus I've been to recently is <a href=""http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/"">Cirque du Soleil</a>, which had quite a different feel. It feels very old fashioned to see trained animals or midget clowns, but I guess it is part of the tradition.</p>

<p>They had some really cool acts. A man juggled seven mirrored pins which flashed hypnotically as they flashed up almost to the ceiling. Acrobats slid smoothly between perfectly poised poses, high in the air (unfortunately the tent wasn't big enough for swinging acts - only vertical motion). A man turning rapid cartwheels on the feet of his partner gave the crowd a scare with a nasty tumble, but really won them over with a graceful recovery and an astounding finish. A team of tumblers did flips and aerials through spinning lassos. Two body builders stayed frozen in unbelievable angles for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Between acts clowns played tiny violins and cracked bad jokes about swiss culture. There was also a parade of trained animals worthy of a small zoo - horses, elephants, Shetland ponies, camels, and even a llama. The ringmaster's young son also seems to fit into this category of entertainment - I have to admit he was cute. The training was pretty impressive. I've never seen so many species walk on two legs before.</p>"

Thus I can just check out the folder on a new machine, add symlinks to the proper files, and I will have my well-loved .bashrc, .vimrc, .profile, etc. I also like the idea of being able to <a href=""http://dotfiles.org"">share these files</a>, since I have invested some serious time in customizing them over the years.

<p>The excitement about the Euro 2008 is slowly but noticeably rising. The latest indicator is this series of ads. It says ""Switzerland is the European champion. In railways.""</p>

<p>Even the most patriotic swiss have to have a sense of humor about their football team. They're only in the Euro 08 because as hosts they are guaranteed a spot. </p>"

Rise up! Rise up!
Through the damp of the earth.
Oh, flee from the terrible tide.
For this torrent doth rise,
rise up to the sky!
From whence the deadly rain falls.

Feel the water seep in
Coming right through the skin
Oh, drink! through you've never known thirst.
See your body, it grows,
At this rate will explode!
So flee to the roof of the world.

There is no escape
From your mortal fate,
For above the dangers abound.
For the birds and the beasts
You will make a great feast
Or beneath giants your body will squish.

By the thousands they perish
In the gardens they cherished,
On sidewalks, in puddles, they're dead!
But look dear, don't cry
Dad will lift this worm dry
For the rest, in the sun they'll return."

"event","The local Oerlikon church celebrated its 100th birthday. As part of the Jubilee service they stretched a giant timeline across the front of the sanctuary and invited people to add stickers for each baptism, confirmation, and marriage that they knew of taking place in the church. The resulting brightly colored timeline was a nice way to reminisce as a community, but it also provided an interesting look at local demographics over the last century. For instance, from 44-48 there were several confirmations each year but only one birth and no marriages at all. Then in 49 after the war the chart was covered with stickers. Another obvious trend was the baby boom in the 60s, which turned that stretch of timeline into a mass of blue baptism stickers."

"event","<p>I stumbled off the night train from Venice this morning. Italy was really amazing, but I had enough hectic moments in my whirlwind tour that it feels really good to be home. I took two showers today, just because it felt so amazing after days of train station bathrooms. In a way my experience in Italy was defined by both the really magical sights and experiences I went through and the pains of travel. The sights, smells, tastes, and sounds of the various towns I went through were powerful, and in a way they were only enhanced by the blisters, misplaced reservations, bad weather, etc. that I encountered.
</p><p>
First, a disclaimer on photos. I have nearly a thousand to sort through, of which probably half are unique and in focus. I have some really nice shots (I hope) but it'll be a while before I get through them all. For now I'll settle for a verbal picture, while its still fresh.
</p>
<h4>Roma <i>- Rome</i></h4>
<p>
I flew down from Basel on Saturday with EasyJet. I was expecting it to be terrible service and uncomfortable seats from the price, but it was actually just as nice as the economy section on United, minus the free coke. It was great to see Ben again. I could never spend enough time with that guy. It's so sad we only meet up for family reunions every couple of years. He has been in Rome since September and knows it very well. As an architecture student (""Archie,"" in Notre Dame terms) he takes a class where their professor walks them around town and lectures on the history, architecture, context, owners, and generally any detail that comes to mind about whatever they happen to be standing by. I got to attend class one day and I was amazed at the amount of detail this woman has memorized about the city. She even knows about the current owners of the various piazzas and their habits. Ben has absorbed all this information as well as books and notes he has read, making him the best tour guide ever. We spent a lot of time just walking around the city, visiting (almost) all 900+ churches in Rome, the old Roman ruins spread around the city, and all the best local eateries.
</p><p>
For me the most powerful part of my stay in Rome was Easter mass at St. Peter's, with Pope Benedict. We had been up late Saturday night for Easter vigil as this beautiful golden church, but we still got up early the next morning to snag seats right in front of St. Peter's. They fill up the plaza in front of St. Peter's with chairs for the occasion and have big TV screens so the people in the back can see what the pope is doing. It started raining just before the service started, gradually increasing over the two hour mass so that by the end the water was sheeting down like from a garden hose and my clothes were soaked right through my raincoat and umbrella. The best part was no one really cared. We all just stood there in the rain, singing hymns in Italian and Latin and listening to the pope say 'Happy Easter' in every language of the world (even weird ones like Esperanza). We stood there listening to the poetic rhythm of Italian supplications and blessings. We pushed aside our chairs and streamed to the front for the Eucharist just as the storm reached its peak, with thunder and a cold river over our feet and the rain-soaked Body of Christ on our tongues as the Blood of the Lord spilled out all around us, for us.
</p><p>
After drying off (I went through multiple sets of clothes for the first few days) we set about seeing all of Rome's attractions. Rome was quite crowded for Easter, but I found the crowds much less obnoxious than those in later cities. There were quite a lot of nuns in Rome, whose obvious enthusiasm about being in Rome is contagious. Also the shear area of tourist-worthy sites in Rome is enormous, perhaps spreading out the impact a bit (as opposed to Florence, which is only about 10 minutes by foot across). The actual sights of Rome were about what I expected - breath taking vistas over the Forum, hours-long lines at the Vatican Museum but gorgeous inside, vast, ornate basilicas, and amazing food (we got gelato between one and three times a day, with panini, pasta, and pizza filling in the gaps).
</p><p>
During my stay in Rome I took a day trip to Assisi, a small hill town in Umbria to the north of Rome. It was really nice to get out of the city for a day. The Italian countryside is beautiful, with rolling hills covered with vineyards and olive groves. Assisi's main attraction is the Basilica di San Francesco, where St Francis founded his order of monks. This is a beautiful church full of pilgrims to see his tomb. Of course, around town souvenir shops sell religious icons and figures of all things Franciscan, which I found tastily ironic for an order founded around vows of poverty. We barely even take notice of shops selling overpriced replica cloaks pre-tattered and patched. At the top of Assisi was a smashing castle whose wall still surrounds the town. I had a jolly time hiking around the edges of it, admiring the views down into the valley and climbing around small farmers' huts away from the tourists.
</p>
<h4>Firenze <i>- Florence</i></h4>
<p>
After a great five nights in Rome I said my goodbyes to Ben and headed for Florence. I was able to meet up with a friend of Ben's, Lauren, who I spent some time with in Rome and who studies in Florence. That provided some continuity and an nice introduction to Florence, which is very different from Rome. It is very compact and therefore you're jostling by tourists all the time. Also, I was shocked to be charged admission into all the churches there. At first this seemed terrible, but I guess it is necessary to keep them properly preserved with the amount of traffic they see. I also discovered that all the churches will let you into a side chapel to pray for free if you want (mass is free to, of course), so I learned to accept the entrance booths.
</p><p>
My favorite attraction in Florence was the Uffizi, which collects many masterpieces of Florencian art. It feels like the second most popular occupation in Florence, after Tourist, is Art Student, and with good reason. The Uffizi holds some really inspiring works, like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Venus_%28Botticelli%29"">Birth of Venus</a>. Venice had a similar local art museum with Renaissance and Baroque paintings through several centuries, the Accademia. It was interesting to compare the two cities' art. Both had wealthy families willing to sponsor art in the hope of buying salvation, but the Florentine school seems much more appealing to me. Maybe Venice just lacked these genius artists like Michaelangelo and Botticelli. Just outside the Uffizi is a big plaza with lots of sculptures, including the original location of David (Michaelangelo's sculpture is now moved to a museum with a long line, but a replica is still there).
</p><p>
Although the churches and art in Florence are top-notch, the flavor of the city really comes from the streets connecting them. These are crammed full of vendors trying to sell you everything from fine handcrafted leather clothes to cheap handbag knockoffs. I actually enjoyed this part of the city - it felt more like a permanent fairground than a big tourist trap. Many of the vendors (at least claimed they) crafted all their own merch.
</p><p>
I had a quick layover in Pisa to see the Campanile (you know, the leaning tower). The lean is really quite noticeable, especially as you're walking up the stairs - it get easier on one side and harder on the other. I then headed to Genova (Genoa) for the night. I didn't actually spend any time exploring Genoa, but I met several very friendly Italians - a priest who spoke German with me and who had apparently been serving communion at St Peter's for easter, and then an angel of a woman who out of nowhere offered to give me a ride to my hostel, at the top of the hill. I wonder how many experiences like that we miss by having our own personal cars in America. Some of my best interactions with people came from striking up conversations with people on the train or by the side of the road as I walked by.
</p>
<h4>Cinque Terre <i>- Five Towns</i></h4>
<p>
These little towns along the Mediterranean were the most picturesque part of my travel. I spent the day hiking through terraced vineyards and fields of spring wildflowers. Coming around a ridge you see the next town huddled on the shoulder of the mountain against the sparkling blue sea. I had perfect weather for hiking. It was even hot enough to require a swim in that beautiful water! Swimming was an even more uniquely southern European experience that it might have been, since after climbing down a nearly vertical path for twenty minutes the area I ended up at was a nude beach. Most people were just sunbathing or taking a siesta, except for a group of Americans (in swim suits) frolicking in the surf. Besides stunning views and good hiking, the region is famous for its Pesto. It is still a bit early in spring, but there were a few farmers already sitting out in their fields by the trail with hand-pressed olive oil and bushels of lemons. I have trouble conveying the peaceful, beautiful landscape here in words. Quiet. Glowing. Picturesque.
</p>
<h4>Venezia <i>- Venice</i></h4>
<p>
After my first experience with a night train (cramped but overall comfortable) I arrived early in Venezia. I really loved this city. The canals are stunning, and not nearly as hard to navigate as I had been warned. There are bridges everywhere and the waterbus is worth riding only for the views, let alone for transportation. The Peggy Guggenheim museum here was great. It was the only museum in Italy I found with modern art. As lovely as Renaissance art is, the religious themes are not exactly diverse. Seeing some Klee and Picasso was a nice contrast to cathedrals and the Accademia.
</p><p>
Mostly in Venice I just wondered the streets, gasping at the view every time I turned a corner on yet another serene white bridge over a canal with the quiet slush of a gondola skating by. It's amazing to think that this is all built on fill by humans. There is a 'Save Venice' fund mentioned in the guidebooks that is active in restoring churches after floods. I can't help but doubt that in all too few years those floods will start to carry away some magnificent treasures of human history for good. Please, ride a bicycle for Venice?
</p><p></p><p>

There you have it! A nice relaxed stay in Rome, with a fairly thorough exploration of the city, and then eight cities in three days. Put like that it seems ridiculous, but I feel like I was able to capture the atmosphere of the various regions and see the major highlights. Speaking Italian was fun, and I will surly miss the food. But I'm glad I made it down there this trip.</p>"

BSG IS STARTING AGAIN FRIDAY!

Details seem a bit thin still, but they released a couple of summary clips on the website, so I guess it's for real. The refresher should be good to watch, as I've kind of forgotten some details amid the wash of 'Watchtower' and the last episode =D

Now I just have to get Isaac caught up so I have someone to watch Season 4 with."

"event","Computer Scientists love the <i>concept</i> of Turing machines, but don't actually ever use them in practice. I can prove turing-equivalence for computations, but I'd never actually made a turing machine that did anything nontrivial before. This semester one of my lectures provided a simulator, so I made this machine:<br /><br /><br />1. Create a TM that adds two numbers.<br /><br /><blockquote>The tape will start in the form:<br />_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * 1 0 0 1 0 * 1 0 0 1 * _ _ _ _ _<br />with the Turing machine positioned at the first (leftmost) star.<br /><br />It should end (and halt) in the form:<br />_ _ _ _ _ * 1 1 0 1 1 * 1 0 0 1 0 * 1 0 0 1 * _ _ _ _ _<br />with the Turing machine again positioned at the first (leftmost) star.<br />Notice that the new number is the sum of the two original numbers, which are still there.<br /><br />The Turing machine should not go past the right-hand star.<br />This way, if the TM loops back to its starting state when it is done, instead of halting,<br />then it can compute the Fibonacci numbers forever if it is started on the tape:<br />_ _ _ _ _ * 1 * 0 * _ _ _ _ _<br /></blockquote><br />I thought the Fibonacci-compatible format was clever.<br /><br />Solution (in their custom format):<br />19 states, 5 symbols<br /><br /><blockquote>#Both start and end. Deleting 'HALT' does the Fibonaccis<br />(start) *--&gt;(,rtA,&gt;), _--&gt;(,HALT,&gt;)<br />#move right<br />(rtA) 0--&gt;(,,&gt;), 1--&gt;(,,&gt;), a--&gt;(,,&gt;), b--&gt;(,,&gt;), *--&gt;(,rtB,&gt;)<br />(rtB) 0--&gt;(,,&gt;), 1--&gt;(,,&gt;), a--&gt;(,store,&lt;), b--&gt;(,store,&lt;), *--&gt;(,store,&lt;)<br />#store value<br />(store) 0--&gt;(a,ltA0,&lt;), 1--&gt;(b,ltA1,&lt;), *--&gt;(,add0,&lt;), <br />(ltA0) 0--&gt;(,,&lt;), 1--&gt;(,,&lt;), *--&gt;(,add0,&lt;)<br />(ltA1) 0--&gt;(,,&lt;), 1--&gt;(,,&lt;), *--&gt;(,add1,&lt;)<br />#add to next number<br />(add0) a--&gt;(,,&lt;), b--&gt;(,,&lt;), 0--&gt;(a,ltB0,&lt;), 1--&gt;(b,ltB1,&lt;), *--&gt;(,save0,&lt;)<br />(add1) a--&gt;(,,&lt;), b--&gt;(,,&lt;), 0--&gt;(a,ltB1,&lt;), 1--&gt;(b,ltB2,&lt;), *--&gt;(,save1,&lt;)<br />(ltB0) 0--&gt;(,,&lt;), 1--&gt;(,,&lt;), *--&gt;(,save0,&lt;)<br />(ltB1) 0--&gt;(,,&lt;), 1--&gt;(,,&lt;), *--&gt;(,save1,&lt;)<br />(ltB2) 0--&gt;(,,&lt;), 1--&gt;(,,&lt;), *--&gt;(,save2,&lt;)<br />#store the number<br />(save0) a--&gt;(,,&lt;), b--&gt;(,,&lt;), _--&gt;(a,endcap,&lt;), *--&gt;(a,endcap,&lt;), 0--&gt;(a,endcap,&lt;), 1--&gt;(b,endcap,&lt;)<br />(save1) a--&gt;(,,&lt;), b--&gt;(,,&lt;), _--&gt;(b,endcap,&lt;), *--&gt;(b,endcap,&lt;), 0--&gt;(b,endcap,&lt;), 1--&gt;(a,carry,&lt;)<br />(save2) a--&gt;(,,&lt;), b--&gt;(,,&lt;), _--&gt;(a,carry,&lt;), *--&gt;(a,carry,&lt;), 0--&gt;(a,carry,&lt;), 1--&gt;(b,carry,&lt;)<br />(carry) _--&gt;(1,endcap,&lt;), *--&gt;(1,endcap,&lt;)<br />(endcap) _--&gt;(,,&gt;), a--&gt;(,,&gt;), b--&gt;(,,&gt;), 0--&gt;(,,&gt;), 1--&gt;(,,&gt;), *--&gt;(,testA,&gt;)<br />#change all ab to 01, then move back left.<br />(cleanL) a--&gt;(0,,&lt;), b--&gt;(1,,&lt;), 0--&gt;(,,&lt;), 1--&gt;(,,&lt;), *--&gt;(,,&lt;), _--&gt;(*,start,&lt;)<br />(testA) 0--&gt;(,rtA,&gt;), 1--&gt;(,rtA,&gt;), a--&gt;(,,&gt;), b--&gt;(,,&gt;), *--&gt;(,testB,&gt;)<br />(testB) 0--&gt;(,rtA,&gt;), 1--&gt;(,rtB,&gt;), a--&gt;(,,&gt;), b--&gt;(,,&gt;), *--&gt;(,cleanL,&lt;)</blockquote>The simulator prints out a trace of the tape over time. Its pretty cool to watch the head move back and forth as it encounters key events. Also, I tried rather hard to structure this in such a way as to reduce the number of state, but 19 is as good as I could get. Of course, you can in general add with a smaller machine (there's a 7state/2symbol universal machine based on Wolfram's Rule 110) but it would require a different input."

"event","Disclaimer: This post is about computer science theory and laundry. To non-CS people it will be boring and mark me as a huge nerd. To CS people it will probably give exactly the same reaction. 

As I was folding my dry laundry today I realized that the laundry room makes a pretty good example of a probabilistic algorithm giving pretty good, consistent results in a social setting.

We have several hundred meters of cord in my building's wash room, which serves three washing machines. Use varies over the week, but often the laundry lines are completely full (sunday night, for instance). To make room  for new clothes the oldest, driest clothes are squeezed to the sides of the lines or piled on the counter. Of course, there is no organization of this process and only minimal social norms to direct it. People just select some clothes at random to remove when everything is full. Yet this algorithm is surprisingly efficient at moving aside clothes after 2-3 days and removing them completely a day or so later.

I wonder if there are other areas of society that could use probabilistic algorithms rather than central control to achieve an equitable, efficient solution. I guess the problem is that no one wants to be the outlier who gets screwed over. It seems like this is the method often used in communal utopian visions (Dinotopia, anyone?). Some people eat more, some less, but on average everyone is fed."

"event","Zsculpt is producing an <a href=""http://www.zsculpt.com/website/games/darkcastle3/"">Sequel</a> of the seminal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Castle"">Dark Castle</a> game. This game drove me nuts back in the early nineties when we had it for our SE (it was a <i>bootable</i> floppy because they didn't have enough ROM to run the OS at the same time when it came out).

I was able to play a beta version of the new one, called either ""Return to Dark Castle"" or just ""DC3"". The sequel, despite over twenty years of improvements in hardware, still plays exactly like the first one: hard as hell. You die from just about everything, from short drops to random crossbow bolts. The enemies still taunt you with their annoying 'nya-nya' sound effects. There are still rats and bats everywhere with take forever to kill with the rock-throwing controls of 1986.

Best of all, I'm no better at this game now that I was when I was eight. It still kills me over and over again until my instincts to preserve my self esteem make me turn it off and do something actually possible.

I love it, and will probably fork out the money when the full game comes out.


<u>Update:</u> After playing a bit more I've kindof gotten the hang of things (the unlimited lives in the demo help).
Questions I would like to ask the original developer:<ol><li>Why does walking into the edge of the screen sometimes give you a concussion for five seconds, virtually guaranteeing death by rat/bat/crossbow/rolling barrel/hand thing, and sometimes it takes you to the next level? Couldn't you at least have some sort of indication whether the map continues off screen? Plz?</li><li>Why do the rocks sometimes bounce off the floor and sometime go <i>through</i> it down to the next level? What does the z-dimension look like, anyway?</li><li>Why is it not possible to kill things even when I have the bigass sword? This coming back to life every 8 seconds is a bit much, eh?</li><li>Who would possibly go into dark evil castles, anyway? Is this prince guy stupid?</li></ol>"

Money Quote: ""[Bill Clinton] is officially not the candidate, of course, but he has become so enmeshed in the campaign that the candidate who is running is often called 'the Clintons.' And that seems just fine to many of the people at these events; they often say how happy they would be to have him back in the White House."" The article is fairly neutral over whether his presence is a good or a bad thing, but isn't the development of this kind of oligarchy exactly what we institued the 22nd ammendment for in 1951? If Hillary attains the white house, how is that different from letting Bill back for a third term?

I agree that he was a good president; however, I believe in the principle behind term limits. On principle, we should oppose this kind of concentration of power in the upper echelon. If you aren't scared by the idea of two Clinton's in office, just think what would happen if we let two Bush's in! Oh wait... crap.

Now, I'm not saying that Hillary would make a bad president. To the contrary, she has shown herself to be an extremely deft administrator and politician. I just wish she was a little further distanced from Bill."

"event","I experienced my first oral exam today. Computational Systems Biology. It was a bit strange. Professor Stelling just told me to pick a topic, and we just ran from there. Fifteen minutes goes by really quick when you're trying to show you learned something over the whole semester. So we chatted about ODE models and the problems thereof, which led into a couple of alternative models. I didn't know a bunch of stuff, but I just said so flat out to avoid wasting time. Apparently that's the right strategy, since he told me I got a 5.5 (out of six; four to pass). Getting such a good grade really boosted my self confidence. Now I'm setting myself up for bitter disappointment if I fail machine learning wednesday. After that its Algorithms, Microbiology, and Quantum Computing at a rate of one per week until school starts up agian mid february. Study study study! I wish they had been a bit more clustered so I could actually go somewhere one week.

So much for the nervous babble. Back to work!"

Lightning klaxon blares brrr-WAAA-WAAA brr-WAAA-WAAA. A fierce blue light flashes in the dark room. I roll out of bed befuddled, barely cognant after the deep dunes of dream. CRASH over goes a chair in my primordial panic to find the assailant.

My mind catches up with my adrenal gland and I'm picking my ringing mobile off the desk. My hand muffles the ring, but the blue flashes from the numbers still light the room.

""Hello,"" I answer sleepily, mind accelerating to the high speed dangers of contemporary catastrophe."

"event","We've had so many shootings this year. Virginia Tech, Finland, now two in one week: Omaha and Colorado. It scares me.

Everyone over here associates this kind of violence with America. After the Finland shooting I heard lots of comments like, 'its something you might expect to happen in the US, not in Europe.' Last week after Omaha, Markus asked me what in American culture leads to this violence. How the hell should I know? Its not something a sane person can even think about comfortably. I get a funny feeling in my heart if I try to empathize with any of these killers. Yet the evidence holds: Europe has had two or three shootings in the past decade, while in the US they are becoming frighteningly common news.

My first response to these questions is my typical defense against critics of america; I'm from Seattle, we're not like those rednecks in the rest of the country that elected bush. But then I remembered the Jewish center shootings two summers ago, and that time newport locked down because that student felt suicidal and brought a gun to school, or the almost monthly shootings on the Ave, so close to my apartment. Maybe its true that Americans are more violent. Can we do anything about it? How could a culture slip into this kind of behavior, when only the unhinged could perpetrate such a tragedy?

Is it TV violence? Copy-cat phenomena? The fact that the US has the highest number of guns per person in the world? Or is there something subtler, which unhinges our youth and makes it possible for them to consider random acts of violence as a possible way of expressing their loneliness, anger, and disconnection?


My prayers go to the victims of the recent tragedies. But even more, they go to those of us who remain. We have a problem which needs to be addressed, but how can we solve it when even the causes are so murky?"

<p>Markus, Ayaka's TANDEM partner<a href=""#tandem"" name=""tandemRef"" style=""color:gray"">*</a>, invited us to join him for climbing. He is an excellent climber who teaches at a gym in a nearby town. A group of friends rides over once a week for an evening of climbing.</p>
<p>The gym was excitingly large and diverse. It has plenty of space for bouldering, top roping, and sport climbing. Most of the holds are the bold-on type, but they use plywood to make the routes overhung or a bit more varied. The bouldering areas are particularly good. There is a large, wide staircase for watching the climbers. The underside of this is completely covered in holds. Mats parallel the overhang two meters below, so you can never fall dangerously - you just slide down the hill of padding. Markus is really fun to watch climbing up this steep overhang.</p>

<p>I went sport climbing for the first time. It is a bit unnerving to have to stop every meter to clip into protection, but also pretty exciting. At least at the gym there is a nice carabiner every meter. I would have to be a lot stronger to hold on while driving bolts every couple of meters on a long run. Belaying for someone leading is also trickier. You have to really watch for when they are clipping in and make sure they have enough rope.</p>



<div style=""font-size:10px"" name=""tandem""><a href=""#tandemRef"" style=""color:gray"">*</a> TANDEM is a program which organizes 'language exchanges'. It brings together two people who want to practice a new language, for instance a native german speaker with a native english speaker. Then both can practice speaking the other language and get some feedback.<br/>
In Ayaka and Markus's case, its German language for Japanese Cooking. Except he still hasn't learned to cook anything, only eaten Ayaka's cooking. Not that I'm complaining, I get to eat her cooking too.</div>"

"event","Due to bad planning, I accidentally bought an extra turkey for Thanksgiving. So on Monday I cooked it up and we had a second thanksgiving for our flat. I was disappointed the first time that among the 20 or so people we ate all the food, so I'm quite pleased that there were some leftovers this time around. Its amazing how much easier it is to cook a meal the second time. My first turkey took hours to dress and truss and stuff. Now that I know how to do it, its not so bad. Maybe I'll roast chicken sometime for dinner. Oh, and carving up a turkey feels manly and primordial. It's strangely appealing.

On (actual) Thanksgiving, I didn't get my camera out until after dinner due to the cooking pressures. However, Tuomas took some nice shots, which he has posted <a href=""http://users.tkk.fi/~ntapola/temp/Thanksgiving/"">On his website</a>."

I had my first experience skiing in Switzerland last weekend, and it was pretty spectacular. The snow was a light dry powder, untouched in many places. The weather was a bit cloudy, which translates as foggy for most of the altitudes we were in, but we got enough vistas to make it enjoyable. The Laax ski resort is quite large. It spans both sides of one ridge and around a bowl to another ridge. The size provides a nice variation in terrain, from steep shoots full of fresh powder to groomed slopes full of skiers.<br /><br />We had a large group (17), so we could split into different groups easily. I mostly skied with Wim and Erik, who are excellent skiers and willing to try the most daunting black slopes. We stayed in a nice hotel/hostel close to the ski lift. It was surprisingly swanky considering the price - lots of colored lights, a glowy bar, and free jelly beans. We had a bit of a problem with the cold water shutting off randomly, eliciting humorous screams of anguish from whoever was in the shower, but other than that it was quite comfortable.<br /><br />Overall, we had such a good time that there is talk of going back to the same place. Now that I've bought myself skis here, it will be very easy to go up next time. I'm going to have to keep myself from going up every weekend!<br clear=""all"" />"

We cooked all the foods - turkey, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans, stuffing, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, gravy, more pie, repeat. Peter is an excellent cook with a great sense of spices and flavors. I managed to do okay as well, with a little help from Joy of Cooking. At final count we had over twenty people squeezed into Peter's flat, but I don't think anyone went hungry. It was a great time to socialize. Usually the only place this whole group could get together would be at a club, so it was nice to be able to have audible conversations with everyone over dinner.<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","An icelandic company called <a href=""http://www.decodeme.com/"">deCODE</a> is now offering personal genetic profiles for under a thousand dollars. They sequence over a million markers and use the results to predict disease, ancestry, and physical characteristics. My favorite part is a web 2.0 aspect: you can 'compare genomes' with 'friends'. This is definitely not catering to scientists or medical professionals. Their webpage plays up popular conceptions of genetics. For instance, they allow you to ""discover what your profile reveals about your physical attributes"" like your genes are some horoscope. Of course they play down the fact that such external characteristics are always due to complex networks of genes interacting in ways that are not well understood and frankly not all that interesting biologically. People who pay for this will do so looking for disease markers (not that they can do anything about it).

I should mention that this is not a full genome sequence. I will not be surprised if someone starts offering that in the next few years for a couple thousand dollars. Pyrosequencing is already ridiculously cheap. Thats wonderful news for the scientific community, but this sort of sensationalization of a technology into a toy seems degrading. Its too bad there will always be dumb people who are willing to pay the money to 'put their DNA-profile on their myspace profile,' as <a href=""http://infam.antville.org/stories/1722774/"">one blog</a> described it."

"event","I don't understand why people like the grotesque feature bloat facebook has gone through. The clean, focused interface that originally set it apart from earlier social sites like myspace has been replaced by the exact same model as everyone else: a core of profile information surrounded by an unordered mass of widgets, dozens of screens tall and jostling for real estate.

I admit I enjoy several facebook apps (graffiti wall, for instance). However, I can't think of any apps that extend the functionality of facebook. Most do quite the opposite - they clutter the profile pages while demanding attention and/or response. Every day I get at least one request to share my private information with some new attention-whore of an application, just so I can see the very special message that a friend sent through that oh-so-cool-but-virtually-identical-to-all-the-others app. You know, ""send a gift, send a flower, send a really ugly cat picture, send a message in a bottle that they won't be able to read for, like, a whole week~"". Really people, just write it on my wall.

I guess I understand why these appeal to people, from a sociological perspective. Sending them allows you to show you were thinking of someone, and getting them shows that of the 800 people on your friends list, some of them actually know who you are. But really, I don't need to display that virtual cocktail on my profile. If you really care, lets go to a bar.

Seriously, facebook is becoming the new myspace. First they let all the kiddies join, then they let you clutter your page with so much crap its impossible to find your wall. Coming soon: background pictures that obscure the text, background music that's impossible to disable, and creepy guys cruising for loli. Oh wait, pedo's are already here!"

The cities are clean, the economy is good, and the trains are on time. But the price of that is their isolationist domestic policy. You can understand why that's a popular position; Switzerland has been successfully neutral since 1815.<br /><br />The largest party in Swiss politics now is the SVP, a right-wing isolationist party originally representing farmers but now pretty pervasive. Their most recent campaign is strongly xenophobic, as you can see from this ad. The words say 'safe sheep' and the picture shows their advocacy of deportations of foreigners for crimes. Another ad shows a bunch of multiracial hands grubbing through a bin of swiss cards, with similar some similar message.<br /><br />Fortunately not everyone feels that us foreigners are just 'black sheep.' The campaign introduced a very strong backlash. Pretty much every SVP poster you see is in some way defaced or graffitied, with everything from profanity to swastikas (I particularly liked the improvements to the ad shown). I've heard the whole ad series was banned in Geneva for its bad taste.<br/><br/>Edit: Actually, I missed a nuance in the translation of 'Sicherheit schaffen.' Correctly it should be 'Bringing safety,' but the resemblance to 'safe sheep' ('Schafe') is a clearly intended pun.<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","A while ago there was a movement in the apple-oriented dev community to submit bug reports against the closed iPhone OS. Although not immediately relevant to me (unless someone wants to gift me one of those pretty pretty phones) I supported the cause and sent in my bug report, expecting that it would be shuffled away automatically to a corner of their track software and deleted. So today I was quite surprised to receive an email in response, announcing that an SDK will be available in February.

In some sense they are simply bowing to the inevitable. Already you can install hundreds of apps through unsupported hacks. If apple releases an SDK they at least have control over the process and the security. Still, when they go so far as to email everyone who expressed interest in the problem, it shows that they are genuinely embracing the dev community rather than just doing damage control. It makes me hope that the SDK will be powerful enough for some good app development.


As an interesting note on corporate culture, the bottom of apple's email contained a nondisclosure statement. That's funny, considering the entire text of the message was posted publically at <a href=""http://www.apple.com/hotnews/"">apple hotnews</a>. There's so much concern about IP disclosure and leaks and so forth these days that no one even bothers to think about it any more; just slap on an NDA and a liability waiver, just in case. Although is it even legally binding to add a NDA to a message if the recipient hasn't agreed to it? I probably implicitly agreed when I created an account for apple bug submission. Damn contracts.

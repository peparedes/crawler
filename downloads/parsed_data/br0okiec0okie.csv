"event","im contemplating whether or not to take my nap or to just dive into calculus. not sure. im tired-yea, but calculus needs to be done. you would think if i studied it nonstop like all day long i would learn it right?! nap=tempting, but eh. so ill be cranky and depressed with only 5 or so hours of sleep...who cares. perhaps by the time im done with this ill make up my mind what i want to do.

so...last night just got shittier and shittier and then it was ok. jd got mad and said im gay for not liking the whole maxum party thing. i think the maxum party thing was an initial blow and just irritating and then to not be able to go over was like just crumbling down any good mood/thoughts i had. sorting through my feelings i guess you could say my feelings are hurt because i guess it seems like working out and going to see hot ladies is more important to him than getting to spend some time with me. im sure if i said that to him hed be like omg youre gay you know thats not true. and yesterday he said he felt bad that he was busy and i couldtn come over and was all sweet and like ""you know i love you""...but sure you can say something to make it all ""better""...but actions speak louder than words. oh well. its not a big deal. im just not in a good mood. plus...i had already made plans with him and worked out all this coming over on thursday crap with him on sunday..so our plans were made and then he breaks them yet this week while we were home he got mad that i broke our plans. hypocritical. whatever...i love the kid...i know all his weird things he does and how to deal with him when hes being a butthead and all grumpy. he knows hes that way and i think he likes being that way....which is why hell be a good cop i suppose. well whatever...the whole thing just sux but theres no point in thinking about it because the situation wont change whatsoever so...looks like brooke has to suck it up again and keep going...gee..story of my life.

hmmm..i dont know where ill venture off to go study today. probably the annex. ill get the most done there. i like the commons but you tend to see too many people walking by and then you wanna chitchat and you totally lose track of the studying that youre trying to get done. i hate having a test on friday because you cant go out on thursday and if you do go to the annex to study theres like nobody in there and you look real cool. i guess thats the life of a nerd and probably engineers can relate to that feeling more than anyone. *sigh* so im thinking maybe ill just stay awake and study and then if i want to take a power nap this evening and study some more and maybe get to bed early. im pretty awake right now. i think im like more wired than anything. eat a few poptarts and get ready i guess. boo. im supposed to be driving over to JDs and hopping into his nice warm bed with him instead...but nope. ah. he said he was gonna get up early to go work out i should call him. wake his ass up if he didnt go work out..which if i had to guess he probably slapped his alarm and didnt go anyways. just a guess though......

fine ill go shower and then slave over calculus in hopes of maintaining my good grade in there. i dont wanna throw it all away now. must get myself into a positive...efficient mind set. if im in a bad mood or whatever i cant focus/concentrate and it really sux. so.....time to get happy i guess! wahoo. alright kids...tell the G*MAN to help my poor pathetic self and for me to have a GRRRRRRRREAT((tony the tiger)) day...and dont forget about making requests for yourself too :0)     later kids."

"event","ah. must vent. not really vent but nobody else around to discuss this with. stupid stupid stupid. ok seriously i have to be like one of the coolest gfs ever. i let him go to strip clubs...im game to join them in the next trip to one...and i dont care that they watch stupid girls gone wild videos etc. but...it doesnt make me feel good about myself. i wish there was something equal to that for us girls to do so boys would know how it feels to have their gfs run off to go see other hott guys that look better than their guy at home. its dumb. theres a maxum hotel party tomorrow night and JD just told me that him and ken and whoever else they can get to go wanna go. im like yea ok. i have a calc test on friday and i am going over there tomorrow and studying and then was gonna go home thursday night like i have for the last 2 calc exams ive had. and hes like welli  just wanted to tell you. so i guess its good that i have a test and cant go out anyways...but bad because its stupid. clearly the only reason they want to go is to see GIRLS. im not dumb. its maxum. i know the magazine has lots of cool junk in it..becuase i read them and stuff, but among all the cool junk is half naked slutty girls. and hes like no no no its a clean party. im like oh yea so youre gonna have just a bunch of drunk naked girls hanging all over you...yea and meanwhile ill be at home studying for a calculus test. that sounds fair. its not that im concerned about him cheating on me but just the fact that the only reason they go is to stare at girls when both ken and jd have their own! its gay. if i were to do that to him hed be pissed. he claims he wouldnt care, but bullshit if i said i was gonna go walk around with guy strippers and be drunk etc..he wouldnt care and be a tad be jealous. psh. i guess ill never understand guys are their constant need for sexness. its not fair that guys have an excuse ""well im a guy"" welllll..im a girl that is a GREAT gf and it makes me feel like shit that your only motive is to go check out HOT slutty NAKED girls...i know hes not gonna want to stay home and watch me study...but at least go out and have fun. thats fine to go out and have a good time, but choosing where to go based on the sole fact that theres gonna be hot naked girls there makes me feel realllllll important and real good about myself. grr.

once i let it soak in i wont be so irritated by it. but for now im just like ugh..cant you think of anything else to do. im more pissed off by the double standard...which is CONSTANTLY there. so dumb. its not fair....if a guy sleeps with a ton of girls hes cool but if a girl sleeps with a ton of guys shes a whore. and just all the stupid girls that feed guys what they want. aka girls gone wild girls...come on now....there is no need to be naked .. yall just want attention so bad that youll do anything. any girl ((which is a vast majority)) that dresses like a skank and promotes her sexualness is only looking for attention because shes not able to get it based on her personality and charm...she has to resort to her body. dumb. all the girls that act all slutty ruin it for us NORMAL girls who are only crazy sluts with our BOYFRIENDS not every thing with a penis. bleh. i hate girls like that.

oh well...ill be studying calculus tomorrow night because someday down the road ill have one MILLLLLLLLLLLLLLION dollars thanks to my BRAIN...not my body. humph! id rather be smart and ugly than stupid and hot---gets you much farther in life, eh?! well ill have my smells to keep me company while our men are out whoring it up like they used to do before they had us. bleh.

ahh..i feel much better now. im still irritated but ill just let it cool off and then i wont really give a shit anymore .. whether i like it or not he'll go. of course now that ive vented all this off...he wont go and it will have been a waste of my precious precious time. oh well....im sure youre enjoying reading this..lol...gotta love me!!! :0)

bye kids..happy studying....we know ill be doing a lot more of it! byebye!"

"event","whew...its been a long one. woke up at like 615ish so i could make out a plan for registration. so surprisingly there were openings for my classes for the most part. heres the schedule:

ANTH-205-505 *Peoples and Cultures of the World* TR~935-1050
CHEM-228-509 *Organic Chemistry II* TR~1245-200
CHEM-238-506 *Organic Chemistry Lab* M~300-550
CHEN-205-502 *Chem Engr Thermo I* MWF~1130-1220
MATH-308-513 *Differential Equations* TR~220-335

so this means i get to sleep in and i end up being done fairly early. hooray! hopefully it wont be pyschotically hectic like this semester has been. bleh.

i tried to take a nap today after lab, but JD called me like 30 minutes into it. i didnt mind. i was outta it. but then i couldnt fall back asleep so i decided to get up. and then i went and chatted it up with christine. super sweet girl! so exciting. things shall be getting a lot better/happier/relaxed. i miss last year. i miss how i could just venture over to the other room and just see what was going on and how we all ate dinner together. we were a family. i miss that family type feeling we had. :0( hopefully in a place off campus next year ill feel that! hooray!

so then kaitlin and i went and ate and then went to the o.chem help session. kinda helped. not that ill remember half the mechanisms/reactions. but we shall see. pennington seemed kinda moody.oh well. and then afterwards we got to study some more. it turned into a giggle fest because we're both deliriously tired and not wanting to learn chemistry. but thats ok. she makes studying more fun. so yea. oh and we're gonna try to get the same classes/profs next semester so good times ahead for that.

well now that ive finally had a shower for today! ((i hate tuesdays)) i must study a lil bit more before going to bed and then the calc-a-thon shall begin. never ending studying until school is done!!! i have to remind myself that in 2 weeks from today i will be happily at HOME with NO SCHOOL!!! yippy!!

well....must study so i do well on my test...check you kids later!!"

"event","yes well...the past week has been good. i got to sleep and eat and spend time with people i care about. what more could i want? i helped put up christmas decorations and then did my christmas shopping and i went hunting with JD and his grandpa. good times good times. i definitely didnt want to come home yesterday. oh well. 

well ive got 15 meals. thats like one a day. perhaps i can make them last. oh well. ill stick to my spaghettios if i have to. my mom sent me back with some raviolis. those could work too i guess. anyways.

so ive got another o.chem exam this wednesday. and then on friday i have a calc exam. boo. ill probably do some chem studying tonight and then tomorrow night i plan on catching up with kaitlin to do our ""hardcore studying"" routine. and then ill be slaving over calculus. this chapter is kinda tricky. its the hardest to teach to yourself, but i should get it by the time i take the test. he canceled class wednesday so thats nice. i register tomorrow morning at 630! eew! and of course all the classes i want are pretty much full. or all the way empty. ill have to work it out. im shooting for no early classes. but we shall see. but im gonna try to take the same o.chem prof again and so far it looks like i might be stuck taking it at 8 am mwf again. i reallllllllly dont wanna have an 8 on friday again but if i have to then i guess i have to.

well i figured id do a lil update since its been a while. i must tend to my homework and then study. im in a better mood now though. not sure why...but hey ill roll with it.

yall have a fantastic night!"

"event","wow..can we say WONDERFUL weekend. after having a semi-crappy/sluggish week last week...this weekend made everything better. despite missing out on the camping of course. sorry kids..i still love you. jd and i seriously like slept ALL weekend. we're officially the biggest bums ever. at least i have an excuse to be lazy. hes just always lazy. for example...we slept until 330 yesterday and then like around 7 we plopped down on the bed and slept for 2 hours. oh you know.. just a 2 hour nap for the hell of it. like who does that?!! i woke up at like 815ish and told myself i would wake up at 830 to at least study for my o.chem quiz which i had this morning at 8. nope we definitely didnt get up until 9 simply because JD got up to pee...he was ready to go back to sleep, but i was hungry...AGAIN. oh yea..did i mention we ate like pigs all weekend too. yea...gotta love that. *sigh* the weather was shitty so hey...all the more reason to just have a lazy weekend. cant get any better when youre with your favorite person in the whole wide world right?!

so i was ready to go home today. the only class i have tomorrow is engr 211 and its worthless. plus its over by 10. and if JD and i drive home together id have to wait around on him and then hes like ""oh i dunno if ill go home tuesday or wednesday"" screw that...i definitely wanna leave by tomorrow. but...id rather ride with him than drive by myself. but he talked me out of leaving tonight cuz its already dark and its still raining. wow what a shock?! im not too excited about driving in the rain and especially not at night. plus im sure the roads are slick as hell since its been raining NONSTOP for like almost a week. damn CS. oh well. i just wanna be at home in my bed with my kitties and my mommmmmmmy! of course im sure by the time i get back ill be like ""omg my mom is so annoying..etc"" heh.

i need to get my hair cut again. i want jds grandma to do it aggain cuz she did a really good job..but i dunno if ill be able to squeeze in cuz shes so busy. oh and i tried calling old navy to get ahold of my boss but he was gone for the night tonight..soooooo i guess ill try again tomorrow. he told me to call over thanksgiving so i can fill out paperwork to be put back on the schedule for christmas. ""old navy..old navy performance fleece""...stupid old navy..but hell its $$$$...most of which will be spent on everyone else BUT me. oh well. its the season of giving right?! im curious to see what jd gets me. he told me last year after i got my magnificient diamond ring that next year wouldnt be as good. ha. yes well i know that. im waiting for my NEXT ring. :0) i have to get my christmas shopping done while im home because when i go home for christmas i leave like right away to go to my DADDYS HOUSE!! hooray!  too bad i have to study for my o.chem and calc exam over break. oh well...study i must! ill have my room to study in. its a good place to work. plus phoebe ((my kitty)) keeps me company. sometimes shes annoyng though and she'll chase my pen when im writing and make scribble all over the page...or she'll lay directly on the book im trying ot read from. silly gato! well kids...JD told me i should come stay over there tonight since i dont feel like going to my class manana. so i think im just gonna do that. so i must go finish packing and stuff so i can LEAVE! hooray!!!

well eat lots and lots of food everybody!! i want you all to be fatter than me! :0) oh wait thats not possible! get back to your houses safely and i hope to see some of yall if theres time! XoXoXo!!!"

"event","hello kids. seriously where the hell did the day go??? like i stayed the night over here at JDs and woke up and drove to aggieland to go to my 8 o'clock o.chem class and then i came back over here afterwards crawled into bed and slept until 2ish. all we've done is sit around and watch tv and eat food. no joke. ha. oh well. lazy days are good days. ive been trying to study for my o.chem quiz. i have to memorize like 30 reaction mechanisms. eh....not really working out too well so far. usually we have the quiz on wednesdays but since its thanksgiving he pushed it up to monday which sux because that means i have to study over the w/e rather than monday/tuesday nights. bleh. it feels like sunday already. i guess its because i stayed over at chelseas on wednesday night ((which was WAY fun and i wish i could do like every freakin night if i could)) and then i didnt do shit on thursday besides go to my one and only class, sleep until bonfire memorial...go to memorial and then went to JDs and went out last night and well you know the rest..and here i am. geez. lots of fun and like hardly any schoolage. i like. :0)

i just took a nice refreshing bath. JD is still playing GTA. its already 2 AM. im not really that tired. i told courtney i would head back to the dorm around 4ish so we could head out to the property to go camping by 5ish. hopefully it will be fun. at the moment im not too too pysched anymore because lots of kids arent going and bc i heard its supposed to rain more and it already has been raining so im sure its muddy as hell. oh well. we'll make the most of it. my main motive for going is to see all my buddies from UT and stuff. i know ill see them over christmas break but this should be fun...lets hope. it was fun at prom. well besides the guys freakin humping the keg and naming it grendell. prom night is kind of a blur now. i just remmeber trying to sleep in the bed of a truck and it was just gross/humid. and then we had the freakin AP test the next morning. oh the good ole days. maybe ill study for my quiz on sunday?!!

so i think im gonna head home on tuesday. my lab on tuesday is canceled and i have o.chem on wednesday but i dont really feel like waiting around to go to it. i have one class on tuesday which is over at 10. its pretty pointless to sit around all day tuesday just so go to a 50 minute o.chem class. im sure whatever i miss i can learn later. eh. especially since my other wednesday classes are canceled. id rather be in my comfy huge bed with my kitties than sitting in an o.chem class. i felt like that today. just sitting there. my eyes burned and i was ridiculously thirsty. JD and i were up till like 230ish or something like that and i woke up at 645. nice 4 hours of sleep. of course im somewhat adapted to that thanks to the roomie. i tend to average 4 hours of sleep with her around making noise etc. however....that should be changing pretty soon. mua hahaha! :0)

well....i guess ill throw my sweats back on and see what my lil deputy dougie is up to out there. plus i believe o.chem is calling my name. bleh! check you kids later!!"

im relieved my stupid chen204 test is done and over with. i made up stuff to put down. who knows if its right or not but at least i had something to write. eh. im over it. ill be upset when i get my test back but until then...im not gonna waste my time stressin over it.

so i feel like poopy. i think im just moody. i dunno. i have this gut feeling thats making my tummy hurt. i dont know what it is. i just have one of those weird feelings when you think something is wrong. i dunno how to explain. i had it before and it turned out something was wrong. so. hmmm. i dunno. i dont like it when i do this to myself though. i stress out over stupid stuff and then get all bent out of shape and eventually it goes away. i hope it goes away. i think i just need to see JD. he seems crabby and i dont know why. i dont like it when hes crabby. or maybe im being crabby and hes just being crabby back. bleh. i dunno. funny how people can be super sweet one day and so not the next. i hate that. i need to be just 100% happy nonstop. ha! impossible. i have senioritis. i want this semester to be over. no stress from school makes for a happy brooke.

well...im pumped for some fun tonight. im sure we'll do homework and watch tv like old times. hooray!!! and then i get to sleep with POOTY!!! again..haha hooray for that too! lol. yall kids have a splendid night and a great tomorrow! :0)"

"event","yea. well tonight is not the greatest night ever. i spent like 5 hours studying in the library. which was very good of me. but...i feel like it was a lost cause. maybe my brain is just tired. but it just wasnt clicking. i dunno. im getting really frustrated...and i think its assisted with my lack of sleep and just eagerness for this semester to be over. i HATE chen204. of course who likes it? i talked to lianne...for those of you who dont know..shes a chemE at UT. and shes in the same class over there right now and she was like telling me how she is thinking about dropping out because its so hard etc. i guess we're all in the same boat. its hard..but its not. i dunno its really weird and hard to explain. i have a C in there. i just need to hang on. if i can make it through than ill be ok. i asked God to give me signs a long time ago to guide me in the right direction and to let me know if what i was doing with my life was right or whether it was wrong. i read into things maybe more than i should. i see some things and im like ""oh hey thats my sign that this is NOT for me"" like when i talked to courtney about architecture im like whoa no...thats not my thing. but when i sit here and stare at my homework/study stuff im like wondering if my fried brain is a hint that i need to stop doing what im doing and move on to something new. i just hope im not missing any signs. or that im not reading into stuff too much. ugh. so hard to know if what im doing is really my 'plan'. well i suppose all i can do is give it my all and continue to pray.

tomorrow after my test i will be more than ready to go spend time at the ex-roomies house. of course ill probably be ready to pass out and sleep. but hell. being with them is good enough right? its already 2. i decided i would skip 211 and just wake up for my lab in the morning. i need the sleep. i dont need 211. and after my lab i plan on studying until i take that damn test. kyle and i are supposed to get together to study. i wish i had kaitlin to study with for this. i dunno where the silly girl is. oh well. too late now. perhaps i can study like a beast with her for the final. that will be another nightmare. geez. im telling yall..my heart will finally calm down tomorrow after im done with that stupid test. i feel like its as tight as can be. im so stressed out. and all day today i wasnt even thinking about the test and my stomach hurt and i just felt weak and shaky. i dunno what it is about this fucking class. i mean really. i just get so uptight and nervous for some reason. i hope the rest of my college classes arent like this. i mean yea i get a lil anxious before tests. but shit...im like about to give myself a heart attack. grrr.

well i called becca and she made me feel better and then JD of course made me feel better. and the roomie gave me hugs to make me feel better. everyone tries to help. my friends are the greatest. unfortunately....school is something i have to do on my own. shit i even have to pay for it. can you believe this?! im paying massive amounts of money to just sit around and stress out. who does that?? really now?!! gr. well its like freaking 2. i need to sleep. please just say a prayer that im not sooooo worked up about stuff and that everything works out for me. i dont mean just this stupid test...but the whole confusion on whether i really should be doing stupid engineering or not. maybe im just moody and im thinking of other outlets....aka....changing my major. i dont really consider that an option but when im all pissy and frustrated i start talking about it. ANYWAYS...i am gonna go for real now.

"event","oh man. where to begin. this weekend was very very nice except for one thing. we'll start off with the bad and end with the good.

bad= ((well its kinda good for me)) so JD went hunting until saturday right? well i was intitially gonna go because i was giving chelsea my ticket to the tech game. but it turned out that i ended up going to the game. so i didnt go hunting....and the camphouse is right alongside this road. railroad tracks parallel the land that JD hunts on and the house is right across from them. and this road comes toward the house like orthogonally and then curves after the tracks like and ends up being parallel to them and the house. and theres this huge trailer from an 18 wheeler that is parked out front parallel to the road and kinda like a buffer in between the camphouse and the road. so anyways... this girl was being chased by the cops at like 2 in the morning saturday morning and JD heard this huge crash. so had gone over the RR tracks to fast and smashed into the trailer. ((thankfully the trailer is there or JD would no longer be JD and neither would his grandpa who was sleeping in there with him)) so the girl smashed this truck that she had stolen into the trailer and was crushed underneath it. she drove the truck so fast into it that it just smooshed underneath the trailer. to make a long story short...the girl was trapped and they couldnt get her out and she died within like 5 minutes. after about 5 hours of commotion and such. they got her out and laid her on the ground and JD said that her head rolled towards him and her face just looked at him. and she had blood all over it and etc. so hes like horrified and upset. he feels so bad that he couldnt do anything for her. and i feel horrible because hes so upset. but he just told me that hes so glad i wasnt there to see it because i would be superly upset. and it sux even more cuz she was only 17. she i think we're gonna put a cross out there for her. but now everytime we're there we're gonna think of her and that night. and i know JD has more to think about than just i do. all i know is what happened...he has to think about what he saw forever. so...say a lil prayer for her and him and i guess just everyone invovled.

moving on to good news. i had such a fun friday night with chelsea. we went to dinner and got ice cream and played with POOOOOOOOOOOTY. her super cute kitty! and midnight yell was fun. and we just had a GREAT time together. i miss not being able to spend more time with her. and then on saturday the tailgates were fun and of course the game rocked because we BTHO TTU. fuckers. it was sooooo cold though. and then saturday night i got to see smelly and the 4 of us chilled and had a good time together. and today has been a lazy day but a good one. still yucky weather.

anyways...tuesday night i have a chemical engineering exam. BOO. so all day tomorrow will be a studyfest trying to prepare for it. so yea. bleh. well its time for me to get some sleep. i didnt sleep well last night despite being snuggled in with my baby. night kids."

"event","past few days have been crazy. well just busy. wednesday i had my crapass organic test. it sucked. and then i was busy all day with class and stuff. and then JD and i went to dinner because he went hunting this weekend and our 18 monthiversary is TODAY... :0)  so we ate and then i was like yea so i really have to study for this 211 test. yup. i went to his place and ""studied"" in kens room cuz he actually has a desk and stuff to study on. JD's doesnt work so well for studying which is probably why he never does. anyhoo. it was like midnight and i just didnt want to study at all and just nope didnt want to. so JDs like you should just stay here. ((he always tries to get me to stay and skip class)) and the only class i had on thursday was engr211 which i havent skipped yet so i was like eh fuck it ill skip. usually i dont like to skip because we have a quiz every class period and they are worth 20% of your grade and so its just stupid to miss them ya know. so yea...i was like oh well missing one quiz wont hurt. so i told myself i would wake up early and study. my body woke up at 730 ((like a good girl-it knows when its supposed to wake up)) and then i was excited cuz i didnt have to get up yet. and the next time i looked at the clock it was noon. and psh...its too hard to wake up and get out of bed when youre laying next to your dougie. so yea....woke up like noonish and showered and ""studied"" once more while kenny and JD went to class. and then lets see i came back here by like 4 and got ready and then jeff came by around 5 so we could ""study"" ((note the quotes because no studying really occured)) anyways...we went off to take our horrible test. glad i didnt waste my time studying cuz i dont think it would have really helped. annnnnd im over it.

so today i went to organic and then kinda just didnt want to wake up for math so i didnt go. JD called me to tell me happy anniversary. woohoo. love him. he was waiting to go hunting. naked and i went to eat at the hullabaloo for a change. ITS SO COLD OUTSIDE. and well ive been trying to get some shit done because this weekend shall be wild and crazy. UT kids are coming in tonight and then tailgates and the game tomorrow and tomorrow night hopefully some craziness at the apartment since smelly is here and well i know i wont wake up until late on sunday so. yyyyyea. might as well get some shit done now. thats true nerdiness right there man!

i really hope we beat the FUCK out of tech. they are all worthless and i strongly dislike them as a whole. yes there are those there who i like and enjoy. but nope in general tech sux. after what you bitches did to our corps last year and just the way the fans treated chelsea and her brother last year when they went to the game just b/c they were aggies. basically tech is the place for the kids who couldnt get into a&m and UT....dont be mad...you know its true. and thats fine. but just because you hold hositlity towards the place that wouldnt accept you...you dont need to act on it. so basically a win against tech would be the most satisfying thing for me. lets hope we do it baby!!!!

well thats about it for now. im just here until someone comes and gets me to do something fun and exciting. have a grrrrreat friday night kiddos!!!"

"event","oh boy. i just took a power nap. i think it might have worked well. i passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. i knew i was tired, but geez. i fell asleep faster doing that than when i go to sleep at night. ouch. of course my head hurts now. do naps ever make your head hurt? yea well they make mine hurt. like short little naps. i did that in high school all the time. i would come home from practice and be like ok im gonna wake up for dinner and i would have the bigget headache when i woke up. oh and my eyelashes are like bent in half. haha i think its funny looking. stupid eyelashes. they are annoying all they do is get stuck in my eye....

well our lab today was very very very stupid, but i got out semi-early...which was nice. and well i kinda looked over some more chemistry junk, but eh. oh and i found out today that if i take one more chemistry class than i have to...ill minor in chemistry. now if thats not nerdy than i dont know what is. haha. ill probably go for it. im about to meet kaitlin to go eat some dinner and then we're heading off to the study session thingy for organic and hopefully that will part the clouds b/c this shit sux and then we're gonna sit down and study together and talk through some of this junk. woohoo for friends. well woohoo for other ""normal"" girls in engineering. :0)  

oh and i also found out that i can make like a 40 on my next 2 engr 211 exams and still get a B. haha. i have an A right now, but shoot....40s and still get a B! thats kickass. haha. i love it. well im gonna study but...im not gonna cry over being confused. ill just do what i can and when thursday rolls around im gonna be ready to get my PART-AY on! whoop!! and thennnn....ill study all weekend for stupidass chen204 exam which is tuesday night and after that...ill be like super happy ((well hopefully..as long as the test doesnt give me a new one)) and ill go stay over at my former roomie's casa and have some FUN! be jealous! weee...just thinking about how great it will be after that stupid test. and then of course its like a few more test and then finals but hell after that its freaking CHRISTMAS. i cant wait! im sooooo looking forward to seeing my daddio! so many things to look forward to...i should start a countdown or something that worked out well at the end of the school year last year. well...im gonna head off to meet Kaitlin.

"event","yea so today was hell. of course most of yall already know why. once again..no need to explain. anytime theres something wrong its pretty easy to guess the cause. gr. hopefully things will clear up. or hopefully ill be getting a roomie more like me. we shall see.

so tired. my head hurts. its the pathetic kind of tired where you just wanna lay down and cry and die all at the same time. plus it doesnt help that i looked over my organic stuff and realized that the test is gonna be a bitch. and i havent even touched 211. i studied last week some, but not really. oh well. do what you can. mondays are always so busy they arent too productive anyways. naked and i did go to the library for a bit but i just stared at o.chem and was like hmmmm yea ill learn that tomorrow. i think im gonna go to the help session for that and then study more with kaitlin. and then i think jeff wanted to study 211 tomorrow during the day. ill try to get a lot done. grr. cant wait for christmas break.

chelsea stopped by to pick up my sports pass. it was good to sit and chat with her. i havent been able to. miss that girl. perhaps i shall escape to their casa. i bum off of everybody for a cozy warm place to sleep. somewhere other than here. eh its not sooooo bad. i was peacefully sleeping at first last night and i was so happy and warm and my sheets had just been washed and the blanket i sleep with was washed and i purposely used JDs detergent and it just smelled like him and i was so happy...awww yes. and then it all ended with phone ringing for 15 minutes. ugh. anyways..hopefully i can be all snuggly and happy again tonight.

friday is JD and I's 18 monthiversary. hard to believe its a year and a half. the half anniversaries are the special ones. ill be so tired/studied out ill be boring. maybe we'll get to do something different. we'll see. either way whatever we do is good.

well im gonna go shower and try to sleep tonight....well im hoping to be able to. grr. wish my luck yall and say a lil prayer that things work out around here and that my tests this week go well. i need it."

my neck still hurts. i asked my mom about it and she said its probably tension. JD said he felt a knot but i dont feel one and nothing seems to help. its not like a headache pain, but just a weird feeling i dunno. its really annoying and now that its cold outside it hurts even worse. i cant ever get in a comfortable position at night cuz it hurts. oh well. im sure it will go away eventually. until then...boo to neck pains....

sucks when JD is gone. its fine if hes here and i am not with him, but i hate it when hes somewhere else. boo. dont know what to think of that boy. i sit there in class and fiddle with my left ring finger and see the sparkles from my ring and just sit there and think. kind of a distraction from class i suppose.  stupid little things remind me of him. or ill see stuff and i think to myself ""oh wait till i tell him...""  so irritating how you can think of someone so much. or maybe im just weird and think about him too much. heh. hell i dont know.  things are so random sometimes.  school sux. i work constantly and just get caught up in the pile of things to do. and nothing ever bothers me. like i dont want to do it, but i dont sit there the whole time thinking about how much i hate it. its frustrating because i just want to sit and relax without worrying about something school related.  i cant drag myself away. i hope i dont end up being one of those people thats like addicted to their jobs. bleh. well i am distracted bc im talking to cupcake so ill check ya later"

anyways. nate and i had a successful mall/CC creation trip yesterday. i got a few new things which is always exciting. i got a cool shirt that says ""texans for bush"" on the front and on the back it has a picture of bush kicking a jackass in the ass and hes got like spurs and cowboy attire on..lol and it says ""kicking ass for 4 more years"" -WHOOP- i liked it so i got it. good to buy things for yourself every now and then. especially if you deserve it. i owe myself! havent decided if im gonna go to midnight yell or not. depends on what kind of mood im in later. bleh. as of now....im thinking no. but who knows i might be in the mood for standing in the cold, dateless, with a bunch of drunkards chanting about how we're gonna ""beat the ever livvvvvvvvvvving..."" hell out of OU. ~cough cough~ yea not too sure on that one. but hey you never know how the game will turn out. im not be pessimistic just a realistic is all. 

i have been productive today.. i wrote my granny a letter and my wonderful wonderful bestest friend in the whole world cassie jo a letter since shes been deprived of the cookie lately. well i suppose i will get started on my ""list of things to do"" booooo!! but hey i have the room to myself now that the roomie has woken up finally and gone out and about. no distractions=good. ill check you kids later.

"event","an important day in history would be today. woke up to find out that bush had 'won' but it still wasnt official. when i woke up from my nap it was official and kerry was on his way to make his speech. i skipped calculus to watch it. i wanted to see what he would say. brent and i watched it and we got the biggest kick out of kerry blowing kisses and mouthing the words ""i love you"" to the crowd. it was almost as if he had won like miss america or something you know. im waiting for the ketchup lady to come waddling up behind him with a bouqet of flowers and a sash. ha. that would be great. bush is just adorable even if he does kinda resemble a yard gnomb/nome/knome/knomb/gnome (( yea my mind just went blank on how to spell that but you get the point ))

ah yes. well tis a bit nipply outside. sadly. well its good but bad. i dont like it when its windy but ha..college station w/out wind=impossible. its cool though..id rather be cold i guess than sweat my ass off getting to class. 

we b/sed our 211 homework again tonight. i drew the diagrams and then we just kinda wrote down some answers. good stuff. who cares when you know youre gonna make an A. plus homework is only 5% of your grade. it hardly counts for anything. psh. of course the test is all from the homework. perhaps i should learn how to do it. eh.

naked touched me with his banana tonight. it was scary. haha. good times. i let him have my cookie. mmmmmm. lol. damn commons is such a rip off. and how the hell do i only have 28 meals and everyone else who i eat with daily have twice as many when we all started off with the same amount. like really someone explain this to me?!!! 

dougie is at the gym. he was too impatient to wait for me to finish my meeting. the plan was that i would call him when we were done and i told him we would finish fairly early..but nooooooo he couldnt handle waiting like 30 minutes and calls me right as we're packing up to tell me he just got to the gym. so now i have to sit around. grr. its the same either way. sitting here or sitting there. i suppose ill get some work done but its hard to work when the roomie is asleep. and i cant go to the annex cuz i know the second i get there JD will call and be like ok im here!!! such a dilemma! :0)  some more STUDYING couldnt possibly hurt me. we all know i do plenty. grrrr. damn engineering.

"event","yo kiddies. quite eventful around here lately as pretty much most of you know already. no need to repeat the excitement..right?! well besides the fact that i always win especially when i dont even start the ""game"" or we could just say i finish what someone else starts. i could make an endless list of analogies but when it gets down to it....as kristen said earlier when i was talking to her...nobody messes with brookie...and yup...still true-and pretty much always will be true. i dont create conflict/drama unless i am forced to and well looks like someone made me. i think its funny how everyone enjoys hearing about the latest updates. ahh...i love you guys!! well hopefully after my yelling and causing one to bring out their ""waterworks"" ((i liked that smelly)) the point is made FINALLY and will be FOLLOWED as asked nicely before.

so today was just dreary weather-wise. i like the coldness though of course it makes me wish it were christmas break and i could just snuggle up in sweats and drink hot chocolate and just sleep all day. i could use a day off. i am studying for organic right now. well im taking a break obviously, but thats what ill be doing. my buddy kaitlin and i are supposed to study together later. the first 2 tests were pretty basic..yet hard..but the material was straight forward i guess you could say...but now its kinda random and confusing. all these reaction mechanisms i have to memorize. eeek! oh well...we'll learn it and rock the quiz/test!! i picked up my engr211 test finally...hooray for getting an A. kinda awkward just sitting in my profs office all alone. its cool that he wants to meet each of us one on one...but kind of a hassle, but hey i picked it up so one less thing to do. his office was such a mess! papers just like scattered all over the desk. crazy stuff. 

well today is election day! i wonder if we'll find out tonight or not?? if its like last time .. geez .. craziness man! i hope we find out tonight, but i have a feeling something is gonna get messed up, but maybe not since they are taking all these extra precautions cuz of last time. eh. i voted! it was worth the 3-4 hour wait! always a plus when you're with dougie and then you get to see erin and tambo. 

well sadly i believe chemistry is calling my name...booo!!! i have a feeling kaitlin is gonna laugh at me tonight when she sees my markered up notes. lol. i always use markers for stuff and thats just how i study. im sure she'll crack a joke on me! :0( haha. shes a good kid."

"event","well today has been dreary and kinda chilly, but not really. i like the coolness but not so much the rain. especially the rain that wakes me up at 4 in the morning. since we're on the 4th floor ((the top floor)) the rain is super loud on the ceiling. it can be nice if youre just hangin out and already awake but not cool when it wakes you up. we got back our calc tests today..i was excited getting like 15 points above the average. thats always a booster and then it got better when i found out that our chemE test is postponed. so that means instead of having a chemE, organic, and engr211 test next week ill only have organic and engr211. and then the following tuesday ill get stuck with chemE. so its kinda good kinda bad. good because i was planning on studying all this week for those 3 exams so its one less that i have to study for. but kinda bad because i was planning on going to dallas/ft. worth next weekend and having fun b/c i wouldnt have any tests or anything, but now ill have a chemE test to study for. so....eh. i think im still gonna go to dallas and just study in the car and at night once we come home. ill make it work somehow because i really wanna get away and go have some fun. especially seeing my sister!

im about to go to my 211 meeting. sadly it will be just me and travis. the other 2 are busy. oh well.. im sure we'll manipulate and BS some answers to turn in which is what we usually do. of course that comes around to bite me in the ass because im gonna have to study super hard to learn all the stuff i should have been learning all along. oh well. im over it.

this weekend was good. i went home and voted. BUSH! JD and i waited in line for like 3 hours but i got to see kids from HS that i havent seen in like forever so that was good. and then we hung out with some of his friends friday night. saturday i just chilled and chatted it up with the family about the latest drama with the roomie jacking all my shit and using it. ugh. but it was so nice to sleep in my bed and snuggled up with my phoebe and pixie!! i love my kitties!!! and then we came back to CS saturday evening. nothing special just the usual brooke/jd-ness. i ate wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too much ice cream. haha. jd bought me ice cream and skittles in return for helping clean up the apartment. eew i hate way too much. oh well its still yummy. its worth the 20 pounds ill end up gaining from it. jk. i had such a hard time falling asleep last night. i hate sunday nights. depressing having to come back to schoolness and having to sleep all alone. booo! oh well. im so tired today im sure ill just pass out the second my head hits the pillow tonight.

well kids...i must start being productive if im gonna get my study on all week. sux but it must be done. lets hope it pays off. have a good one!"

JD and i picked up some new fishies at the pet store today. quite exciting. the tank had only 2 fishies left and so i think we got 5. yea we got 5. 3 'guppies' and then 2 of those sucker fish. the tank was like growing some nasty filmy stuff b/c there wasnt enough in there so we solved that problem! i think id like having a beta i dunno though. he said hed buy me a bowl and all that .. but eh. i dont need one. the bunny they had there was soooooo cute! too bad they're bitches. rocky had one when we were younger and i remember it hopping around the house trying to hide from us and it would scratch you. but hey they are cute to look at.

i will get to see my furry animals when i go home tomorrow. we're going to VOTE for the first time ever tomorrow. its early voting in houston so jd and i are gonna rush home after my test. we gotta make it there in enough time before they close. dubya all the way kids. as much as my mom is gonna hate me for voting for him i dont really care! i should purposely wear my texans for bush shirt. anyways..we're only gonna stay friday night and then come back. so no fears i will be gracing BCS with my presence this weekend.

such a nerd. speaking of nerd there was this super cool kid dressed up as a calculator in front of zachary today. LOL. definitely a classic costume. where the hell he got it i dunno?! and then this other dude was with him and he was dressed like a pirate or something i dunno why but they gave me candy and told me to fill out some survey. so...i just filled it out because of the laugh i got out of their ridiculous costume. the candy wasnt too great though. we'll need to work on that next time. :o)

so dinner was exciting and enjoyable for once. K, corky, naked and I all ate at the underground. of course we all got a fair share of ""brookes a fatty"" jokes. naked claimed it took so long for my order because i had my meal and courtneys and then i ate courtney. and then when i got my ice cream because thats what fat people like myself do....the girl gave me literally a jumbo jet cone. she was debating on whether or not to throw it away because it was so big and lopsided. always fun to watch me eat it. fat people have a weird way of eating ice cream cones ill have you know?!?

so somebody stole all of the roomies towels out of the laundry room. how stupid is that? who wants like 10 yellow and white striped towels. oh and her PJ pants were in there too. stupid. i think i would be pissed enough to go door to door asking for them. ridiculous. that was like all of her towels way to go losers!

well...i guess i could do some more math or i could go to sleep since i wont be getting my usual thursday nap. stupid masudi is making us pick up our exams individually from him tomorrow. like hes really gonna have 200+ students come in during his what... 3 office hours? ugh! well i guess thats what you get from a prof with a pick-a-prof rating of like 2 stars. everyone dislikes him and now i see why.

today jeff and i were supposed to meet and finish the calc hw thats due today. we decided to skip out on it and go to the msc in need of engineering paper. i saw this girl from high school catherine busch who i havent seen in like FOREVER!!! shes such a sweet girl. i had like history with her my freshman year and shes stayed friends with me like since then. so i was excited to see her. shes really like one of the sweetest most genuine people i know. so yippy for that. and so i picked up some paper a big waste of $6 for stupid stupid paper! jeffs a pussy and wouldnt let me buy him his. he didnt have cash so i offered to pay for it and he could pay me back but hes too much of a gentlemen to let me do that. so basically we walked all the way down there for just me. silly jeff. we made up some new slangs. like substituting the word jeff for fuck. cuz we were pondering over how fuck became a bad word and that any word could be a bad word. so we were like oh hey jeff could be a bad word if we wanted it to be. so hes like ""yea we were jeffing all night last night"" come on guys you know its funny! ""jeff you"" ""hey lets jeff"" ""man we jeffed so hard"" ""jeff me"" ""jeff me harder"" ""mother jeffer"" ((now thats a good one)) and the really good one is just when you get pissed off just scream out ""JEFF"". we found it humorous.

ahhh yes. well the time has come for me to go back to stupid chen204 for recitation. i dont see the need for going to the same class 2x in one day, but whatever. id rather just get it over with in one bang than walk all the way back to zachary again. oh well its a workout. must burn off the numerous amounts of kitkats i eat weekly. jk yall.

roomie carved a really awesome pumpkin. thought id share that with you. but really its like REALLY good. i thought me and JD created a work of art. hers is like a stencil pumpkin. its not even realistic. its good. puts anything ive ever done/seen to shame. i should get a picture of it for you to see.

and of course being a girl just sucks. enough about that. grr. rather early than late i suppose right ladies?!! and of course popping 3 advils on an empty stomach isnt such a good idea. oh well. im fine now that ive had something to eat. but im not feeling much being done by the darn advil!

i guess chemE will be a class i torture myself through until the end. everyone ive talked to was like no no no everyone will be ok they arent gonna weed us out anymore blablabla. man do i hope they are right. we get our tests back but i havent even seen mine and i know its not gonna be pretty. of course im sure nobody else's is gonna be either since its a consensus that it sucked huge donkey balls. a buddy of mine did pretty well and i looked over his and he put way more than i did so hopefully i managed around the avg. of course the avg was a 60 so i hear. grr!! so much stress. oh but he did mention that every chemE graduate hes talked to says this class is the worst and that they made their worst grade in it. so i feel better knowing that. plus..hell if i can survive this loco shit than id be aight. the sad thing is the class isnt even thhhhhhat hard..its like afterwards im like ""oh ok"" but i just cant be like that during the test. shes got some crazy ways of asking questions so that you realllllllly gotta know whats up. but its so simple in the end. i dunno. its hard to explain unless you see it. oh well. im just rambling.

well its time to head off to chemE-ness. and then after that ive got an engr meeting. the usual monday/wednesday routine. hopefully our hw tonight wont suck like it did last time. of course it didnt help last time that we were highly distracted by the astros game.

talked to the sister and mom today. everybody is good as usual. my mom lost another 4 pounds. so thats like almost 30 in about a month. they say youre supposed to lose about a 100 pounds in a year so i guess its around 2 pounds a week. so she should be doing good then since shes following what is supposed to happen. im excited for her.

last night we watched it and it was fun. always good to kick back with some beers, friends, and BBQ. matt about had a heart attack when we lost. some kids get too into sports. it sux but not worth killing someone. i was so tired for some reason that i went and crashed at like midnightish. i think JD wanted me to stay up later but i was pooped plus i had to wake up super early to drive my ass back over here for class. 

so i like woke up at like 620. i had set my phone alarm for 645. and i was like dangit i only have 20 minutes. so the whole time i was laying there contemplating going to school. i was like hmm lets see prons/cons. and at first i was like no screw it im not going and then i was like no no i have to go. bleh. so finally my alarm went off and i just decided it would be better to just go and take my usual nap afterwards. so i did sadly. it sucked so bad. its so COLD that even on the weekends i will purposely lay in bed just to not get up and walk around in the frigid apartment. but i did. i got up and got ready all while shivering. and then i had like 10 spare minutes so i snuggled back in before i went. :0) always a good thing. but yea..JD drove me to my car and i went on my way. i forgot how it sucks in the mornings when ur windows fog up and get all misty. i used to know how to use the defroster thingy to get it off but its been so long i forgot. i only had this car for like a month of high school so i dont remember how i got it to work. anyways...i found a spot! ooo exciting! and i went to class yea yea yea it was gay. and then napped and woke up to see my beautiful lil cupcake in my room!! and then i was supposed to do some calc hw with jeff and kyle but umm yea i kinda didnt go to calc class and then i dunno we just didnt meet. so that will be my weekend assignment...calcathon...ive got a test friday so.

K and i just had some lunch. my tummy is happy now. her dad and brother are coming tonight. so that will be cool to meet them. they are crashing on the floor in our room. i have to sleep here because the game is at 12:30 tomorrow and traffic will be crazy if JD tries to drop me off for it. 

oh super exciting news!!!! the kitty came back!!! last night i was walking out onto the porch and i look up and she was just chillin on the steps and my mouth just dropped open! it was sooooooooo great!!! so i fed her our left over sausage and JD brought her out a lil thing of milk. she was so happy. and i was so happy. everyone=happy. haha

and even more exciting news..the hourly countdown for smelly is on!!! so exciting!!! we're gonna have fun this weekend oh yea we are!! ive been so excited i cant hold still. i even cleaned my room. beat that. oh and i did a lil doctoring to the computer. i even cleaned up my buddy list!! like who does that. i decided i had kids on there that i never talk to anymore or just random folks on there so i deleted them all off. like who cleans up the comp?! obviously someone totally in love with their snot partner!! and shes definitely #1 on the list now!!! haha.

mmmmk well perhaps a lil calc wont hurt me. check you kids later!!!"

"event","so how bout them astros?! oh yea. i am so excited. i cant wait to watch this game. i just hope hope hope hope we actually win. keeping the fingers crossed!

well today was splendid. woke up went to engr211...which of course sucked. damn masudi cant teach shit. like nobody knows what the hell is going on in there. bleh. ""teta a teta b"" he cant say theta for some weird reason. kinda like how yurttas my chemE prof cant say third...i get the biggest kick when she tries to say it. and she says it a lot she'll be like ok well lets find the volumetric flow read of the 'turd' stream. she says turd instead. oh boy. good times. so then i came back and napped for like ohhhh 4 hours or so. :0) and then i woke up and got ready and ate. and now im gonna head over to JDs for the game festivities.

i was talking to the sister today and she thought my LJ drama was hysterical. good times. as did a few others. go me!! at least i know i brought more smiles than frowns to my lovely fans' faces!! teehee i still have a firm belief that i can be and am very nice to anybody, but that when someone does me wrong or pisses me off that they WILL know about it one way or another. its just a matter of diggin for info. some know that i will go straight to the source and let them know and as we've all witnessed sometimes i just vent it out w/out going to the source. sometimes its necessary to inform the ""pisser offer"" but sometimes its not that big of a deal. so fair warning for everyone. you know how i am. so dont take it as such a shock if you get on my bad side. i enjoy being solid and not letting others walk all over me and i pride myself with not letting that happen so...really if you call me a bitch i actually take it as a complement and an enhancement to the ego. :0) audrey and i are very good bitches.. her moreso than me. i guess it runs in the family huh?!! ive learned from the best man!! haha.

speaking of family im mad that i cant get the picture of my cousin and her baby to work on my stupid computer. i wanna see it! she had her baby tuesday and its a boy!! shes only 20 so eeek scary times for her. poor thing had to have a C-section. man o man. well at first we thought it was gonna be all awkward that shes pregnant and the situation isnt the greatest, but now i think the family has dealt with it and is very happy to have a new member. so im relieved that its not gonna make it all tense and stuff.

well i believe its time to get this party started!!! whooooooop!! im gonna drive to JDs and that way i can come back at big 8am for my o.chem class. yes im that big of a loser that i will come back to go to class.hahaha. seriously im jinxed. if i miss class...its always the day that the prof goes over a problem that he ends up putting on the test. its happened 3x. so ive learned my lesson..just always go even if you tune out the lecture. that way i wont feel guilty for not going. ive made an impressive record so far this semester...ive only skipped one class and that was math on a friday so..hmmph! beat that! 

you kids have a great night!! and lets hope the 'stros rock the hizouuuuuuse!! haha im jk

one more day smelly!!! cant wait for the drunken snot sex pictures!!!"

"event","well thats just a shame that people dont like it when they get called out upon..tisk tisk tisk..perhaps its a reality check that some havent been very kind lately?!?! hmmmmm. the rude/coldness i have received this semester is a cause to post whatever the hell i want. take it as you wish. you read it your problem. i post my thoughts on things on here ((mostly for my LJ fans *wink wink* to read for humors sake)) and its my right to say/feel whatever i want.  whatever is going on at the time is what i type up. heres an example...

so i show up to the meeting and guess whos there tonight?!?! you betcha he shows up. maybe to make a point about my LJ comment or maybe because his guilt got to him for skipping out on several meetings already. whatever reason he was there. and surprisingly didnt have any rude comments to make like he usually does. such as referring to himself doing work, anybody having a 'problem', or making statements like ""well we'll see who got a better grade on the test""   i think it might possibly be the first meeting that wasnt awkward due to the tension b/w us and him. of course any conflict gets thrown onto me since im like the team coordinator or maybe the only one who speaks up probably because im a girl. it would be great if things stay this way and not go back to how it has been lately. i appreciate good times over bad times as im sure most do.

bad times today...astros lost. how tragic. figures right when i come back to the room stupid cardinals get a home run. booooo. well at least we came close right?!

K went to A+ for her math test so looks like ive got the place to myself without a damn thing to really do. geez! this is a first. JDs working out for the rest of his night apparently so..ill just enjoy some quiet time i guess.

well nothing much else to say...see you kids later...and feel loved that you get 2 yes 2 updates today. im making up for a week of silence!!! :0)"

"event","yes well..i have not updated due to my ridiculous week. sadly i had a chemE test last night from 7-9 and then my organic test this morning at 8 so yea..i havent been in much of a mood to update. i got like 3 hours of sleep monday night and its catching up with me today. my eyelids feel so heavy. ive decided that chen204 is the worst class ever and well yea. boo!!!

today has been just as crazy. woke up for o.chem exam which was pretty hard then went to chen204 ((boo)) and then came home got ready and did math hw with jeff which we basically just gave up on..and then i went to calc..and of course i cant get a week free from anything..i have a math test next friday..i hate fucking friday tests...just stupid...ugh...and then after that i had to meet with my chemE team and then we went to chen204..like everyone in there has a fried brain and didnt feel like figuring out the problems..myself included..done with that and now i have to meet with my engr211 boys..of course dickface ""cant make it""..some people are just worthless.

i shall devote a paragraph on my annoyances with dickface:
  i dont understand how i was even friends with this kid?? total change over summer. yea hes always beeen somewhat cocky, but at first i guess i just thought he was actually as smart as he made himself out to be, but when i realized he made basically the same grades as me...well...hes just not that smart then. so he makes fun of kids in our classes for asking what he thinks are dumb questions. i mean yea sometimes people do ask pretty stupid questions but you shouldnt snicker or like roll your eyes at them its just rude. and obviously nobody is equally smart so the kids that arent as smart you shouldnt just shrug off and ignore or baby them. if someone asks how to do a problem he rambles on in these mumbo jumbo words personally bc i dont thikn he really knows what the hell hes doing either. hes sooooooo COCKY! and so full of himself. so he buys his clothes from abercrombie?! soooo what! college=tshirts and jeans. also..you cant pull off a sexy look when ur a tubbybutt.  hes desperate for sex and thats pretty much the only reason why I think hes with his gf. he used to bug me last year on ""sex tips"" as if ive got tons to offer...which leads me to determine HE SUX IN BED! and by his looks..hes probably got a small weiner. big ego=small dick. hmmm lets see..what else...oh and how he thinks hes a hardass and talks shit. bring it bitch.  someone asks a simple question and he jumps up and is all like hostile ""is there a problem..you got a problem with that"" whats gonna happen someday when the other person really does have a problem...what you gonna do then dickface?!? huh huh?!! yea thats what i thought. ugh. anyways..some people are just worthless sacks of shit and well dickface definitely is.

ahhh yes. well moving along to a new topic. astros play tonight and so do red sox. come on stros/sox. boo to yankees. no me gusta! i plan on watching the games since thats right i dont have any immediate work to do! ha beat that!!! 

well...im outtie...enjoy the update kids.  yall are such procrastinators..i love it!! muahahaha!!"

bleh. as we all know my mondays and wednesdays suck ASS. and this wednesday sucked ass just like every other wednesday. well minus the going to eat with my deputy dougie. must start studying tomorrow for my 2 tests next week. chemical engineering will rape me so hard ill probably die so .. yea i think should probably get to studying for that. o.chem can just i dunno...but it can do something besides making me study for it. eh oh well. im looking forward to the air show this weekend. hopefully it doesnt rain or something. its supposed to rain tonight. woohoo. i love sleeping to rain. oh and now that our AC is fixed i wont have to make an igloo with my sheets tonight. rain + normal room temp.=heaven. 

started my car tonight.  it started.  jd said its running pure? i dont remember what word he used but my gas smells really strong. it will probably like blow up as im driving it. damn car. i am making him go home tomorrow and having him hunt on friday since i have class on friday. i know if hes here tomorrow night ill just end up fucking around and going to the hall or something and NOT studying which is what i really need to be doing. and i know i wont do much work over the weekend because i never get anything done when im home. 

tomorrow is my mom's first day back to work. awww. ill probably call and bug her. shes been off since like july. lucky lady. i wish i could sit around and get paid for like 4 months. psh. i dont think shes looking forward to going back..but thats like us having to go back to school after summer so..yea.

oh and my sister is a huge slacker and talks to me all day online while shes at work supposed to be working. ha. love that girl. brrrrrrrrrrrop! <-yea you know ur laughing audrey. ahhh yes. cant wait till the wedding. hopefully i wont get trashed out of my mind like at my moms wedding. but i dunno. jk i wont get wasted but ill have fun watching everyone else get trashed. we'll need a few drinks after a super long catholic wedding. sucka must convert to being catholic. thankfully jd and i are both baptist..no conversions going on for us!!

"event","ah yes. finished all that i needed to finish today. and so i get to go to bed early. sadly it will still only get me 7 hours of sleep, but eh you do what you can. luckily tonight there wont be a stinky clint in our room snoring all night and having his alarm go off at 550am.  cool me thought it was time for me to get up when his alarm went off and i all jumped up confused and half asleep thinking i needed to get up. and then i looked at the clock and was like ""oh its his not mine"" K is just like ""Umm yea"" haha yea im cool like that. still nothing beats me telling becky last year about what the pH was when i was half asleep/awake.  good times being a loser. i pride myself with my scholastic dreams and sleepwalking comments.

well hooray to an o.chem quiz at big 8am. maybe this time i can sit in the right seat. we have the same assigned seats for each quiz and test. the quiz last week i wasnt paying attention and squished and wiggled past like an entire row to get to ""my seat"" and realized i walked down the row behind mine. that wasnt fun. figures my seat is like directly in the middle. so i wiggled past all of them to just wiggle by the row in front of all them. stupid kids who get to class 30 minutes early. i show up with 10 minutes to spare and the room is packed. lucky for me the guy next to me who is seat 19 was all confused because the 1 was missing on the seat so it said 9 and hes like ""how is there no seat 19??!!"" me being the nicest person in the world told him he was in the right place. at least it took the embarrassing edge off of me.

"event","hooray..monday is over.  nobody likes mondays.  i dont like anyday involving school. it was pretty today though so that was cool.  it went by fast.  JD got to come over tonight.  he said he needed to type up a paper and he doesnt have word on his computer so he needed mine.  he comes over and then is like ""uh i dont want to"" so just doesnt.  he claims its only worth 10 points, but we'll see.  i told him he needed to do it, but oh well.  astros won. good deal man.  im still pissed that the texans didnt win yesterday though, but its ok.  oh and the aggies totally kicked ass so lets hope they can BTHO oklahoma state when they play them away this weekend.

this weird guy in our dorm that harasses me for not joining intramural volleyball told K that he would pray for her. ha. nice touch dude.  we got our laughs from that.  seriously, the more you follow me around and bug me for not playing the more likely im not going to ever play any IM sport for this FUCKING dorm. oops i said fuck! fuck fuck fuck. he about SHIT himself ((Yup theres another bad word)) when he heard me say that bad bad word that should never ever ever be said. gay. some people need to get a life. FUCK! its not that big of a deal. just because someone decided to say that certain words are ""bad"" words i dont care.  they just randomly chose words and were like ""oh thats a bad word dont say it"" psh! haha. K and i clearly dont care we enjoy using bad language because its fun and the more we see that it pisses people off or offends them..the more we'll say it. so there. and NO im not going to play IM volleyball. END OF STORY.

on a lighter note...tuesday is JD and I's 17 monthiversary..and yes for those of you who cant calculate that out..its ONE year and 5 months! hooray!! we dont really care, but its still fun to acknowledge the day right?! well im FREEZING so im gg take a shower and hopefully go to bed."

thursday night after 9=me in a much better mood. cant wait. a lil creepy that my dougie will be 20. old fart. oh well part of life.

day was long. after my engineering meeting..which we left in defeat because the problems were just ridiculous and gay...kara and i went to the mall for the ""top secret birthday mission""...of course JD has to ruin it by BEING at the mall while we're there.. silly boy... so we had to escort him and ken out of the mall so we could complete the mission. and boy did we...with a special jewish touch..teehee...we also got super cool stuff for thursday cuz we are sexy bitches like that..we decided to fill our tummies at chilis...it was good...fun times i love getting to go out and be away for a bit. JD got me a super fun shirt .. texans for bush..good stuff. 

so now that ive collaborated with my buddy kaitlin over our organic chemistry lab...i believe ill arrange some more organic lab crap and toss a shower in there and then start the MASSIVE studyfest...story of my life...i hate it...i have an organic quiz wednesday which is like taking a test...so ill have to study for that...and then engineering exam on thursday...boo...yup .. i have yet to start studying.. i feel liek such a slacker compared to other engineers and the biggest go-getter compared to 'normal' people. bleh. looks like this week will suck yet again. whats new.

i just want to go home. thats all i want. my bed for the first time in 2 months is like the sweetest thing ever.  lucky for me JD and i are going home friday when im done with classes..HOORAY!! i cant wait!! :0) not to mention JD's grandparents were raggin on me for ""ditching them""...i believe ive ditched everything...well...back to work i go..."

so my mom is all upset with her hubby and the whole court case drama..i feel bad that im not there to talk with her about it. so much drama. she doesnt need any more than shes already got..poor mommy..but she keeps losing weight so thats cool/good for her.

well since im such a  procrastinator i still have all of ch 12 calculus sections to do before my test tomorrow..yea... its cool though jeff and i are both at the same spot and we're gonna study in the morning before the test..so hopefully ill magically learn it all...eh JD is here to pick me up ill post it later...*sorry smells* :0)"

AGAIN!!! every damn weekend since we've been here-hes gone home.  stupid deer lease junk. but its cool.  im all thrown off now though..at least we theres no game this weekend so i can actually sleep.  figures no game and no JD when i dont have much homework to worry about. eh.

just hung up the phone with my mom and shes good.  she said her tummy hurts a little bit but she gets out of the hospital sometime tomorrow.  shes gonna stay in her hotel until sunday and then shes gonna drive back to houston.  hopefully it wont rain on her the whole way home with that tropical storm that might be coming. 

im too tired to go out tonight. i think nate and i have decided to be enginerds and just do some of our shit and chill.  clint is insistent on going out so maybe him and kait can go out and have fun for us losers that stay home. haha. im over it. im too tired to give a shit.

"event","yea so i think i just about memorized all the common functional groups for my o.chem test on wednesday morning...its always a plus to know what a carboxylic acid anhydride is right?! yea.  got to meet with my engr211 boys at 6:15..joy.  last meeting went great with the exception that someone didnt show up..but hey..thats ok.  i actually passed the EPE for CHEN204...thankfully!! i was pretty nervous thinking that i might not have passed.  i felt bad for the kids who didn't because pretty much everyone in there passed the english AP tests and we dont need english tutoring.  i would have killed someone if i had to go to freakin english tutorials for an engr class. i already got shafted with the damn technical writing b/s last semester for physics.

talked to my mom on my way back from class.  she made it to dallas and was at the doctor's office getting some more tests done before the surgery tomorrow.  im worried, but i know everything will be ok.  still anxious for it to just be over with. shes supposed to call me back later so i can at least talk to her before tomorrow.

called JD too while i was walking back.  i wish it was last year when i got to see him like every damn day.  this whole once a week crap sux.  but i just dont have time and neither does he really.  hopefully he'll be studying for his 4 exams this week.  he made me feel better yesterday by draggin me away from my ""studies"" to play some football.  he always knows what i need and takes care of me.  i wasnt feeling good saturday night and he stayed up with me until almost 4 and scratched my back until i fell asleep. !!AWE!! he makes me smile

i wish my latina cupcake was a CHEM E with me...i feel better having her taking the same tests as me. its no fun tryin to help each other out when we arent taking the same class/prof.  oh well...we're gonna continue rocking the engineering world dammit!

well if i want to rock the engr world i must tend to my studyfest..yippy!!!"

"event","mmm..sleepy cuz i didnt go to bed until almost 4 and then roomie's friend kept calling over and over again this morning even though we were asleep and nobody was answering..talk about annoying.  its cool though im not gonna get mad cuz her friend is just crazy like that and its not roomie's fault..it was almost more humorous than irritating.  last night was fun.  of course going to yell w/out DOOOOGIE ((as clint calls him>>as in dougie houser or whatever from that show)) isnt fun but its cool to just be there w/ everybody.  who needs to mug anyways right?! after yell was cool going to rachel's party and i actually saw friends from some of my classes and stuff there. a few beers and then going to the pizza place in northgate was a good way to finish off the night. pizza was good.

talked to my mom earlier about all the drama between her and my sister. eeks. always gotta be something going on. i think shes ok now..her surgery is tuesday.  not too thrilled about her having it, but thats her decision. since mom talked my ear off i havent gotten much done.

finished the prelab crap for o.chem ((boo)) JD called and hes back in CS..he wanted to beat the traffic from the game so thats good.  hopefully he'll be studying while watching the game on tv since he has 4 tests next week.  im gonna pack my bag so he can just swing by and get me after the game.  

well im starving and need food that way i dont pass out at the game like i did last week.  then ive got to find the kids im going to the game with cuz i think they're at brent's parents' tailgate party or something like that. maybe we'll win...hopefully cuz last weeks  31-0 was kickass.

BTHO CLEMSON!!!! A-A-A-A-A!!!!! YELLOUT 2004!!!!!"

((is she dead??))... so i pull the sheets over my head hoping she slaps it off and actually getsup.. nope.. becky is out.. so i beat the hell outta her alarm clock and shut it up back to snoozeland...and i think by the third time it went off she finally got otu of bed...silly slut! anyways.. my pol sci class is dandy...anything is better than engineering.. ugh! and so now we are just chillin .. becky is done for the day..however i still have to attend a nice math class..but luckily i have 2 friends from high school in there wtih me..so this is a nice thing.. anyways.. things seem alright except for my engineering class which basically scares the shit out of me b/c i do not do computer programming..yes so i took comp sci junior year..but hello.. we cheated the whole time or just pieced it together without really knowing what the hell iw as doing..and of course we dont use the same language that i used..so...yea.. computer programming and graphics..hell no..that is not me..but i shall survive baby.. yea well.. at least JD understands i will be a slave to school..my cute lil guy!! that i just adore!! awww!! anywyays...time to sneak in another nap before math..i could shower but that would require too much work.. adios!!!"

"event","so...tonight was definitely a different type of night.. saw a new side of things and realized i dont know... grrr...like if only i knew then what i know now...and by then i mean 8th grade when my afternoons consisted of a smiling blue-eyed boy sitting across the aisle from me..if only i knew then that my crush for him would grow into a tangly jungle of something os much more than a slight little crush..but i feel stupid for going overboard with my feelings since it seems rushed at some times but then taken so long at others.. 5 years is forever to know the ins and outs of someone.. he jokes that he knows me better than myself and that he can see what im thinking just wtih my facial reactions.. i guess he could read them tonight.. i guess my face goes blank when i have a hundred things running through my head and its hard to keep track of everything when theres something else going on...i feel so ridiculous for liking someone so much.. i dont want to be stupid and thinki feel something thats not really there..but its so hard to deny myself such happiness and good times and i know i sound super serious and completely nonsarcastic compared to how i normally talk..but.. i think of it as a serious thing..i think its serious that i dont plan on ending things.. but how can i be so sure... people always change and grow...but in the past 5 years ive changed more than i ever have in my entire life and those 5 years ive remained absolutely head over heels for the same guy whether i admitted to myself and others or not...all i can think about is how crazy it is to have him be so influential in my life for 5 years and knowing that i want him to keep being a key part in everything in the future too.. im anxious to see what the future holds... i wish in 8th grade i knew about whats going on now..but i guess if i knew that then it would take away fromthe fun now...but knowing the future would make me feel confident with my feelings now.. or make me want to eradicate them all together...grrr... so much jibber jabber......im ready to just talk to him on the phone....."

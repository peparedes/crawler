"event","so it's friday and a crappy one at that! totally unmotivating weather.  Makes me wanna stay in bed and fuck all day long!!!  I've been horny lately and I like it (~~evil grin~~)!!!  I was on birth control for a while and have been off for a total year and I'm finally getting my full sex drive back!  Fuck birth control!  I know how this shit works ~~ it takes away ANY deserve to want to have sex.  No way!  It got so bad that I wasn't even in the mood to have sex with myself. Although the ONLY cool thing about being on the pill is that my tits got big.  Like size D big - I loved them!! But I'd rather have a sex drive then big tits.  I mean if I really, really need big tits there's always implants - which I wouldn't do.  So, I'm back to my C's - not that I'm complaining about my girls at a size C.  I was always happy with my size C's but when they went to D's...well all I can say was wow! At first, I remember being in denial about them being a size bigger, but when i tried on a size D bra and saw how good my tits looked I fell in love!  Anyway, I stopped birth control last year (around this time) becuz I couldn't stand my lack of sex drive! for those of you who know me, you know that I used to have quit the active sex drive! but soon after the pill my well ran dry!  So, now it's been a year and through out this past year it has slowly resurfaced.  Granted, it's not the way I was when I was 16 but yeah I'm not 16.  But it feels great to feel like a woman who desires and is horny!  
so, lately I've been in the mood for girls.  Actually, I am kinda graving a lap dance.  but last weekend Jamie and I and a friend went to the local bar to watch football and drink like bastards.  well, needless to say I got wrecked (I think Jamie and my friend did to but I was to drunk to notice) we came back to my house to await her brother to pick her up and apparently I attacked her.  She's an attractive girl and I wouldn't mind having her share Jamies twinkie with me.  but apparently i was a sloppy drunk and was all over her! I was kinda embarrassed about it the next day but she assurred me i was cool.  it's not like she hasn't flitered with me or we haven't talked about it but this was the first time something was done about it. but it was just a funny situtation.
anyway, i was talking to my girlfriend today whose 30th bday is coming up in january and we both agreed we should go to a strip club and get lap dances!  so thats somthing to look forward to after the holidays.  
well happy friday - hope everyone gets laid this weekend!!"

"event","I am so happy this month is over. Yes, I know there are still 3 more days left to this month but I am considering it over!!  This month was just one big cluster fuck! 
Shit has not been working out lately.  My job sucks ass! Actually, it's not like the actuall job I do sucks it's more like my paychecks suck!! who doesn't complain about their paycheck! we all wish we made more money, but that's not even my issue.  I work 14-16 hours a day, practicually 6 days a week, and being in sales you don't get any overtime.  but whatever, i wanted to be in sales and thats not the real issue either!  the issue is that im getting fucked by another peer! so, i'm putting my resume out there to see if i'm worth a shit because i can not afford to work for this company.  Im losing money right now! it's so pathetic.  ok so that's my rant about work.
I just came back from Texas yesterday, visiting my friend chris and his girlfriend candace.  I had fun, it was nice to be away.  Jamie couldn't come so that sucked!! but all in all we had a good time.  they showed me downtown houston, i was there once but barely remember it.  then we went to a renaissance fair which was really cool, it was the first time i went to one, so it was fun but it sucked cuz jamie wasn't there with me.  then we went to the space center which was cool, but i kinda was expecting more that what i saw.  i guess the next time I'm in florida I have to go to the check out the kennedy space center to compare to the houston. but it was fun nonethe less. on tuesday we played paintball and that was a blast.  running around shoting paintballs at people can be a very theraputic and rewarding!! it took alot of stress outta me.  I must do it again real soon; but next time maybe Jamie can be there so I can unload on him. he he he!! that nite we went to see Team America.  Fucking hysterical!! the movie was dumb (but I was expecting that) but it was so fucking funny.  great puppet sex scene!! some singing numbers that were pretty funny too!  but now I'm back in the real world  - that sucks! oh well.  
looking forward to a better November!"

"event","so i think my little self-loathing faze is over for now....until next months period.  did think about serious things all weekend - go me! had a pretty good weekend too! spent it at the beach with Jamie.  I love the beach and I love Jamie so all was good.  did drink much.  didn't really want to.  had a couple of beers friday nite and then a few drinks on saturday nite.  it was soo nice being at the beach friday and saturday.  i am looking forward to doing it every single weekend.  
considering the fact that im trying to save money deseratley. I have to give Jamie back 1,000 and then save as much money as possible for vegas.  i do not find it easy at all to save money.  ijust cant seem to do it. huh!!  so spending every weekend down at breezy spending as little money as possible works for me. 
how can i lose? not spending money and sitting at the beach all day!! 
so i have school tonite.  Summer school with Math.  God I hope I get it! we'll see!!
so seeing as i dont have much to bitch about, i dont have much to write about then either."

"event","First of all Mondays just suck!!! Now matter how great your weekend was (and mine was)....Monday's just suck.  I can't believe how fast this weekend flew by. But I had a great time at the BBQ. Got drunk...but not stoopid - so that's ok.  Had my picture taken....that's always good, christened (sp?) Jamie's truck....who can ask for anything more!!  

Then even after we got back to Bklyn yesterday I had an awesome day with jamie.  I didn't feel tired or hungover.  We had a great day.  Jamie came over a little while after he dropped me off with some food for dinner.  We had amazing, hot, sweaty, dirty, rollin' in our own filth sex!! Then ate dinner and went to the movies.  In a weird way it almost felt like we were living together.  We usually never eat at my house...usually always at his.  so, i guess cooking something, hanging out and relaxing on the couch just made it feel like he belonged there.  It felt good actually....but I ain't pushing for anything.  I have the rest of my life to be with Jamie...and as much as I can't wait..I know that there are certain things that need to be taken care of first.  But still it was a nice feeling :-)

So, back to work.  I thought I was gonna hear about this new job that I interviewed for on Thursday and then had another informal interview for today.  Managers and supervisors are acting like I already got it...but ya know I haven't seen anything in writing yet.  What pisses me off is that there is training in Chicago all next week and when do they plan on telling people if they got this job (there are 8 positions open) on Friday???? I mean this place can really be ass backwards!!!  and then I was talking to a secretary who informed me that WE make all the travel arrangements!! How fucked up is that!! Like I have all this money to book last minute air fares and hotels!?!?!? Yeah, the company will reimbursed me....but come on ...give me a break!!! Corporate can be so ass backwards sometimes...it's just ridiculous!! and now that I have to wait till tomorrow to hear about this damn position.....arrrgghhh!!!! I hate waiting .... fine WHATEVA!!! guess I got no choice...I'm outta here for the day...goin' to work off all my frustration (and all that beer from this weekend...) at the gym...."

Ok, so I hope that you all know that I absolutely LOOOOOVE High School Musical! I also hope that everyone knows that it is what got Noah and I together. But anyway, a lot of you probably don't know that they're doing a concert tour. 
I got two VIP seating tickets to the one in DC! XD They just arrived in the mail today! I am so excited! Not only are they going to do songs and dances from HSM, but Vanessa, Ashley(OMG LOVE HER!!) and Corbin are singing songs from their albums!!
Here's a video from Ashley's first performance in San Jose of ""Headstrong"". I love it! Her outfit = love! Her voice and talent = amazing! The video starts off with Lucas introducing her. I hope everyone likes it!

Wasn't that amazing?
Well anyway, I really hope that my special someone, Noah, can come. :/ That is what is getting me so down lately. He doesn't know if he can come home for Christmas or not and it really sucks! (PS- He's in Hawaii for those of you who don't know!) This would be the most perfect time ever for both of us... but it totally sucks and is really getting me down that he may not come home. :'( What's even worse is that I have no friend support. No one is ever available, so I'm left home just thinking about the worst case senarios and not keeping myself busy because my parents can't ever let me go to the mall when I really really need to just go somewhere and chill out. I really want to have him home for Christmas... I don't know what I'm going to do. He's due into Iraq in September. Which means this is his last chance for a Christmas before he goes there. I don't know what may happen...... I hope for the best, but I guess I have to prepare for the worst............."

I'm going to Family Day and Graduation at his bootcamp in Parris Island. Tomorrow, I'm going over to his house to meet his mom and her fiance for the looooong trip down to Parris Island, South Carolina. It's going to be nice though. To see Noah. He'll be so happy to see me there for Family Day and Graduation. :) 
I've given the anime club role to Travis for the week. I hope he can keep the freshmen under control. We have like 40 people in anime club. Most are crazy freshmen! 
See everyone when I'm back! :) Love.

So Mr.Kozik had to choose my class. He put me in... SAT PREP! I already took that dreaded class last year! Not only that, but I don't have a science class at all now! I'm going to be behind since my whole schedule is going to be messed up. They also didn't give me photography 2, which I need to help me with my photo editor position on newspaper. God, what a great way to start off my junior year! It's no use putting my schedule up here since it will be changed. So I will post when I get my new schedule. 
I will post with pictures from Erin's birthday party next time I update my LJ. :)

"event","I got a letter from Noah today (my 18th one!!) and he invited me to Family day and Graduation! Family day is a day before graduation. He told me to call his mom immediately after I read the letter, but I read it during my break at work and I didn't want to call her after work and risk calling her too late. My parents say I can go! As long as I can make up all the school work. :) I'm going to call her tomorrow about it. I'm so excited!! I get to see my Noah two days before I would've! Yay me!! (London Tipton impression from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.)
Work was actually kind of fun today. Laura was able to bag for me for about an hour and a half. :) She had to go level and then she left.. :( At least I had her for a good amount of time! Mike tried to take my letter from Noah. Then Anna came and was like ""what's that?"" and I told her, ""it's a letter from my boyfriend who's in Marine bootcamp!"" and Anna was like, ""boy! you better give Christa her love letter back!"" and Mike did. Hahaha! Mike tried to tell me more shit about Noah. Like he's a marine now and he's going to be an ass and that he's going to go gay with all of those sexy naked men. Pfft. Whatever. I can tell from every single letter that Noah is still Noah. :D 
I'm excited! Very excited. XD
So I went clothes shopping with Laura yesterday. It was a great time. I love Laura! We were there from 4pm to 9:30pm! It's was great! XD I bought some shirts. Lol. I'm going to be banging in my new outfits. All the little boys will be jealous when I'm walking around with Noah. Same with all the little girls. They'll be jealous when they see Noah in his sexy tight Marine Corp uniform. Oh yes. &hearts;
I'm off to do my summer assignment now. Lol. Yes, I still have to do that. :(

That's it. Other than going to the mall and hanging out with Laura lots!! :) I love Laura. She's my bestest best friend in the whole world. She was the only one I really hung out with all the time with this summer. We're defintly friends forever!! 
It was great to recieve letters from Noah and sending him ones. I've gotten 17. I'll probably get a couple more before school starts. I love Noah so much!! I feel it, I know it, we're forever. :) <3333 
I'm kinda looking forward to the school year, yet I'm kinda not. I'm excited for Noah coming back in September. It's what I'm looking forward to most!! Then there's anime club, newspaper, and the great times with friends in the morning, lunches, and after school hanging by the auditorium. I hope I can get in at least one play this year. But probably not because Ms.Clarke hates me. :( There's also homecoming. Hopefully, anime club can make a homecoming wall! XD There's also the trip to AnimeUSA. Hopefully Noah will be able to attend. :) Most of my friends are seniors. :( This is my last year to enjoy them!! I hope we get some cool freshmen too for anime club. :D I'm going to make my binder into a collage again. I'm going to have my favorite things/people on it. Like Noah, my friends, favorite celebs, me with voice actors, favorite anime and manga, favorite scenes from The Suite Life and Hannah Montana, favorite music artist, movies, etc. :) 
Another thing that sucks, anime club may be going to the freshmen orientation. But I can't attend because I working. :'( Damnit all. All of you anime clubbers, have fun recruiting little incoming freshman! :)
Well, I'm going to eat and then my daddy gets home I have to go back to school supply shopping.

"event","Mike Koelher showed his movie earlier tonight to everyone in his church group. I was invited to attend. Of course I wanted to attend because I hadn't seen it yet! I got props on my sword fighting part with Mike. It was fun to hear people's reactions and everything. I think I looked ok this time unlike my High School Musical project. Lol. The sword fighting looked sooo awesome!! I'm very proud of it. I can't wait until Mike emails it to me. I will show it to everyone of my friends who want to see it! It's the start of my acting career!! Lol. At the beginning of the meeting, everyone was like ""who is that weird girl?"" and then after the movie everyone was like ""Oh you're the girl!!"" Lol. I'm pretty proud of myself, I thought I was going to work worse than I actually did. :) Yay!!

"event","So Otakon put up their schedule! I'm excited!! Caitlin's mom also emailed the schedule of some of the voice actors to the WTA, so that helps a lot!! If you read this Miss Helen, thanks! This is probably going to change a lot. I haven't scheduled like when I'm going to be in the dealers room or eat or anything like that. But these are the events I'm planning on going to:

<u>Friday:</u>
8am- Get tickets to Nana Kitade and MUCC Concert
1pm to 2pm- MUCC Panel
5pm to 6pm- Moonphase Premiere Panel
8pm to 10pm- Nana Kitade and MUCC Concert
10pm to 1:30am- RAVE!

<u>Saturday:</u>
11am to 1pm- Caitlin Glass and Troy Baker autographs
12pm to 1pm- Yoshiki Panel
1pm to 2pm- Nana Kitade Autographs
2pm to 3pm- Yoshiki Autographs
4pm to 6pm- Colleen Clinkenbeard and Monica Rial autographs
8pm to 9pm- Basilisk Premiere Panel
9pm to 10pm- Trinity Blood Premiere Panel
10pm to 1:30am- RAVE!

<u>Sunday:</u>
1pm to 3pm- Mike McFarland and Monica Rial autographs
1pm to 2pm- Tofu Records Panel

These are due to change... but that's it for now! I can't wait until I get to hang out with everyone! Laura and I are of course going to be together during the con for most of it. Then I get to be with Alexis again!! I just wish Noah could go.. :( I know he'd have so much fun and it'd be great to be able to be with him during my favorite event! Especially raving so we could griiiiind! Lol! Anyway, there's only like 4 days until Otakon and 3 days until Pre-reggie pick up! Tomorrow I get to hang out with Laura!!!! YAY! :)

This is one of the pictures I took for Noah and sent it to him. It's my favorite. Plus it wouldn't be fair if everyone saw all the pictures I sent to Noah. They're for his eyes only. Hehehehehe!!!! :D

That's all. :) Work sucked today. I worked 7 hours and they only gave me one 15 minute break. Fuck them. I'm quitting soon. :(

First- the most important. Now I have four letters from Noah! :) They're the most important things in my life to me. They help me go on- I read them like everyday. That's the only way I survive work. God, I love my Noah soooo much!! &hearts;! Damnit I miss my man so much.. but, he'll be home. You know, on the 18th, it was exactly a month since we last saw each other. The 22nd will be our 2 month anniversary. :) We'll hopefully be together for our 4 month anniversary!
Second- Speaking of work, I hate it again. They forget to tell me to go on break. I haven't trained enough. There are too many angry snobby customers. I'm slow. Grrrrrr. But I need money. So I'm staying. For a little bit more.
Third- I got to be in a movie! :) If you went to Broadneck 04-05, then you probably know who he is. Mike Koelher. He made Elevator which was a big project that was showed at my school at the end of my freshman year. Well, Andrew told Mike about me, and Mike said he had a part for me. So last Wednesday, that's where I was. I was fighting Mike while he was dressed like Jack Sparrow with fencing swords while going up and down stairs. Man, it was tough, but FUN!! LOL! I was a pirate! Arr! :P I can't wait until I get to see the final product!! It's going to be shown at the Broadneck EP Church. If I'm allowed to bring people in to see it, let me know if you'd like to!! Mike told me the fight scene looks really good! :) 
Fourth- My party was AMAZING!! I really would like to thank everyone who came! It was a blast and I'm glad everyone who was there had a great time! It was my first time being able to have a sleepover, and I really enjoyed the five girls who did. Laura, Bre, Lexi, Emily and Candace. :) I love them all. I love everyone who attended my party! Thanks for attending and I hope everyone had as much as I did!  
Fifth- I'm a dork. I bought the first volume of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody! Lol!! Dylan and Cole are so cute!! Ashley and Brenda are amazing! The ABCD(Ashley, Brenda, Cole, Dylan) team crack me up soooo much! :) My favorite TV show of all time now! LOLOLOL. I'M A NERD!!!!!!!!

I actually like my job. Cashiering at Giant. I'm not all that great yet, but yesterday I was told that I was doing great for only my second day. I think it's because Anna trained me on my first day. She's amazing! I don't think I pissed customers off. There was an old guy flirting with me saying I should have the flowers he was buying. Then my old assistant principal from middle school, Mrs.Boardman came through my line. I memorize a lot of things. But it's just the way to ring up produce and the way to take care of checks, WIC, and other ways to pay other than cash and credit/debit cards. 
I went to the carnival with Laura and Max. It was a lot of fun. But my parents only gave me $11! So I could only afford 7 coupons so I could have $4 left to buy caramel apple pieces. Lol. I hope to go back soon when I have money so I can do more!!
So I work today 4-8pm. Please come through my line! It'll make my day to have someone come through my line!! :)
That's all I got to say. Except that I'm a hyperactive Suite Life of Zack and Cody fan now. It's my favorite TV show ever!!!!!! It's on Disney. Dylan and Cole Sprouse are cute. Ashley Tisdale, my favorite actress, is on there and there's Brenda Song too!! :) Watch it. BTW, the DVD comes out July 18th!! YAY!!!!!

One problem though- I have to start working on my birthday! July 5th. Very sweet 16 my ass! Oh well, at least my party is 10 days after that!! I have to give a 10 day notice of when I'm going to be off. :) I work 5 hours a day, making $6.50!
Since I'm working on my birthday, my tradition of going to the Inner Harbor with my dad has been changed to the 3rd. That's when I'll celebrate my birthday. :) 
I need to go out today to get stuff for my party. There's a little rave, and then there's going to be watching anime and movies. I hope to order sushi, but if not, pizza. 
A couple of nights ago, I got a call from Noah's mom. She said she had recieved a letter from the Marines which gave Noah's address! She gave it to me and told me that he'd be thrilled to hear from me and that he'll be able to write me back after 2 weeks of bootcamp, which will be 2 weeks exactly tomorrow! She also told me something ridiculous about writing- you can't make a mistake on the address or else he'll have to do extra push-ups!! :O WTF?! But I wrote him, I made sure I didn't make any mistakes!! I don't want to cause him extra push-ups. Man.. I miss him soo much! :'( 
So yeah, I can't think of much else to say. Summer kinda sucks so far. Hopefully it'll get better! :)

"event","This LJ entry's subject line is Noah's favorite quote that he kept repeating to me today. Today was his last day here before Marine bootcamp. He was at my house from 10:00am to 1:30pm. We watched American Pie, messed around and planned for his 10 days off in September. I cried a little bit. But he wiped away my tears, held me and calmed me. I'm alright now. At least he can't cheat on me. No girls. Just 80 men and he can't be gay in the military. It's better than him going to college where a lot of hotter and older girls would be. I will see him again soon... and I look forward to those 10 days more than anything. 
I'm going to try to hang out with a lot of my friends this week to help me get more optimistic though. Even though I may seem fine and happy, part of me is depressed... even though I told Noah I wouldn't be.
It's time to end this LJ entry before I begin to cry again.. I hope Laura and I can get together to watch Nana tomorrow. If not, I'll find someone else. Lexi? Travis? I dunno.. hopefully someone will hang!!

I'm pretty excited. I just wish AMA could've been on a different weekend since Noah is leaving Sunday.. but I'm leaving the convention Saturday night after the rave for two reasons. 1- Dorthy has to leave Saturday afternoon so she can't chaperone us that night. 2- So Noah and I can have more time together, even if it's only 2 hours, on his last day. 
Laura, Dorthy and I are going to rock AMA in the face! We're going to spice up this con, recruit more con buds, find a hot asian for Laura, shake our booties off at the rave, throw an awesome room party, dance to some rap in the hallway randomly, etc!
Well, I gotta get ready for AMA!! Tonight, Noah and I might get to go on a date tonight so I really need to get this stuff done before he comes home from his dads!! I probably won't be able to update until Monday!! So have a great rest of the week everyone.

Eww... this is a really bad picture of us. We look like wiggers!! Lolololol!!!!

After graduation last night, I went over to Noah's house and met his whole family except for his father. We watched the senior slide show and then he brought Andrew and I over to my house, where I gave him graduation presents. I got him ""The Little Book Of I Love You"" and then I made a collage of pictures of us and framed it and wrote some lovely dovey stuff on the mat of the frame. :)He loved them! I was so happy that he liked my presents!
Today, Noah and I are going to try to get together for a little bit. Then I'm going to my cousin's graduation party for a half hour and then to Travis' rave!! I have an eventful weekend! Tomorrow I'm going out to brunch with Noah and his family to a resturant in downtown Annapolis by the water. It's going to be lot's of fun!!
I'll update some more later!

"event","I'm so over that guy I liked on crew. I tried talking to him at the chorus concert Thursday night. I poked him and said ""hey!"" and he just said ""....hi..."" very coldly and walked away. So then I was like ""eh, whatever. His loss!"" and I'm moving on. I don't plan on even trying to talk to him. If he's going to be such a jerk to ignore me when he finds out that I liked him a little bit, then he doesn't deserve any recognizion from me! 
I have a new look at things. When people have problems with me, it's their problem not mine. If they don't like me, forget them. It's not my fault. I'm not going to be the kind of Christa I was before.. who would panic and try to change so people would like me. No, I will not be like that anymore. I won't change for anyone. If someone has a problem with me, they need to deal with it and get the hell away from me. 
Anyway, Noah and Lexi came over to my house after school for a little bit to practice a scene from High School Musical for my media productions project. We're doing the audition scene where Sharpay and Ryan sing ""What I've been looking for""! It's my second favorite scene!! Bop to the Top is my first! :)

Guys ignoring me after they find out that I like them. The only guy that didn't was Greg... and it's just his job to deal with that stuff. I was finally starting to get over him.. and starting like that guy on crew with me. I hate being ignored. I hate that feeling!! It's one of my worst fears, being ignored by people, especially ones that I care for. 
But now everything is ruined. I'm depressed... again. I'm just about to say fuck it all, crawl into a little ball in a corner and just shut myself away from everyone and everything.

Some I knew before the play, some I didn't. I'm going to try to take pictures tomorrow. So you can see what fun it is! Got pictures of Whewell today. :)
I have a lot of pictures to post up here. I will sometime. I'm tired. I'm off to bed, even though it almost 9pm. Night!"

After the puppy, we went to Borders.. and I just HAD to buy more teen magazines for HSM stuff! I FINALLY GOT A POSTER WITH LUCAS ON IT!! Well, it has all the 6 main stars from HSM on it, but you know.. IT HAS LUCAS ON IT! I love it. I also HAD to buy Death Note volume 5. I haven't read it yet, but I'm excited to have it! Death Note is an amazing series! So if you're reading this, BUY IT NOW!! hehe.
So after the mall, Dorthy drove me over to Severna Park with me giving her directions to Laura's house so that Dorthy could met Laura's mom. Laura's mom approved of Dorthy! YAY! So then Dorthy took us over to China Buffet for lunch. :) Very yummy! After that, it was time for Dorthy to take Laura and I home.. and get on her way back to VA. :'( I WILL POST PICS WHEN I'M NOT LAZY! Lol. 
So then once Dorthy left, it was just Laura and I. She was able to hang around until 10:30!! woot! So we walked around my neighborhood since it was so nice out and we played at the park, lol, came back to my house, read through the teen mags, lol, and watched HSM! 
Yesterdy was a very good day. I hope to get pics and videos up soon! From yesterday and Friday.
Today, Emy is coming over to use my camera for photography class. Since the one she had borrowed from Ms.Bisby wasn't very good with closeup shots and she doesn't have film or a micro lens. Which I have. Then I'm going to show her HSM. Wow, three days in a row of watching HSM! Lol! woot! Go me! I'm going to know that movie word for word soon! This will be my 8th time watching the movie!! But that just means that it is an awesome movie and everyone needs to go see it at least twice! :D I &hearts; HSM!!!!!!!! Yeah, it's turning me into a prep and a Disney channel fan... and I'm sort of losing interest in anime some.. :'( Some of my friends have been saying to me, ""OMG Christa!! You've been talking about HSM more than you talk about anime!! It's freaky! The soundtrack is the only music you ever listen to!! What's wrong with you?! Are you sick?!?!?!"" Lol. Maybe I am sick. Haha. 
So I upgraded my LJ to sponsored so I can have 15 avatars. Lol. Most of my new avatars deal with High School Musical. More specifically, Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel in HSM. :D
Well, I gotta go get ready for Emy to come over in a bit. Biyaz!

Around 4:30, I picked up Travis and Lexi and they came over to my house. &hearts; We went to my neighborhood's park and then Emily Raither called and we met up with her since her neighborhood is kinda across the street from mine, so she walked. We went back to my house, and watched High School Musical the dance along (and yes, we did dance along to Zac, Lucas and Ashley's instructions..lol), played DDR and PumpitUP, danced and sang to HSM music, ordered and ate chinese food, took some pics and videos, and hung out. :)
Yeah, today was amazing. Once I get the photos and videos from Lexi, I will so post them here and on my myspace too. There's videos of Travis and I doing the warmup that Sharpay and Ryan do in the movie before Bop to the Top, then Travis and I doing a little bit of Breaking Free. Then Lexi and I doing What I've Been Looking For. And another of Lexi and Travis singing Breaking Free. The rest of the time, we just sang stupidly and danced like retards to the music! :) Pretty much one of the best times of my life. Just running, dancing and singing all around my other house! &hearts; I worked my voice waaay too much. I'm starting to lose it due to all the singing. Lol. We all opened up a lot to each other! Travis said we were the first ones to ever really hear his real singing voice. Same with me. They were the first ones to hear my real and actually <b>good</b> singing voice. They said it was amazing! I didn't believe them at first, but it seems the more I sing the better I get and the higher I can go and the more in tune with the singers I get! I can't wait until I get to show some more people my singing, if it's as good as my friends have said so far. :)
It also seems Lexi and I are in the same situation about relationships and etc.. except hers is a bit more serious. I most definitly won't go into detail on here, but we're both trying to surpress our feelings for someone we really like/love with another guy we like. I'm glad someone can understand. Except, Lexi can bounce back from anything. I really do love that about her. :)
Oh, my dad hurt his back real bad though.. he pushed himself too hard with mowing the lawn.. :( So... I'm sorry Alexis... but I can't make it to your play! :'( :'(
So yesterday, I bought a $3.99 magazine just for the Ashley Tisdale poster. Lol. It also came with a Zac Efron poster... I'm not a fan of Zac Efron, I think his eyes are the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.. but he doesn't even sing his own music! I'm more of a Lucas Grabeel fan, if you couldn't tell so far. Lololol. It makes me mad that every teen magazine has Zac(he's like on every single magazine cover!), Ashley and Vanessa info, but I never find anything on Lucas but some quotes in articles on HSM. So I emailed one magazine company telling them that not everyone is a Zac fan and that I'd like a big Lucas poster and some Lucas goodies! :)If you want to help me with this, please ask me for the email!! :D
Well, I better go to bed. I'm singing as I write this... to HSM music, yes. Lol. So I better go to bed before I totally ruin my voice!! Who knows what I'm going to do tomorrow, now that my only transportation, aka my dad, can barely leave his bed.. :(

Today was homework and shopping day. I saw a lot of clothes that I like. I'm getting into the kinda preppy fashion. It's kinda weird, but I kinda like it. :) 
So I joined Lucas Grabeel's forum. :D It's been fun so far. Everyone is so nice there, unlike some forums I've been on.. *coughOtakonforumcough*! Lucas is on there, but he never really posts. Not that I expect him too. 
Here's a little message though: yeah, I'm lusting over Lucas. So what? It's my life. If you don't like it, don't talk to me, seriously. I'll bring him up somehow. Sorry, but I just can't stop talking about him. He's sooo hott! My lust for him is helping me take my mind off of who I really like because it appears he's in a relationship right now. I know that the chance for to even meet Lucas is like .01%, but I can still dream... can't I? Yes, I can. I don't get it why people get on my ass about liking Lucas, but if someone who they also knows is into Orlando Bloom and talks about him more than I talk about Lucas they don't get on their ass. :(  It just pisses me off. I have only two friends so far who understand and listen to me. Laura and Alexis. Thanks girls! I love you two!!

Lexi is the Coke-a-Cola warrior!
Then Lexi and I were pulled out of anime club for my group's Media Productions video. Our assignment is a news story. We decided to do a story on the vandalism. So to make it real, we drew on the brick wall with chalk.. cuz we knew it'd come off. But we still got yelled at anyway. We didn't get into much trouble at all. We were planning on cleaning it up anyway. Here's a picture of Sarah and Lexi starting to clean up:

My parents pulled me out of the class and took me home to yell at me. Well, for my mom to yell at me. Why can't she be proud of me for getting 7 A's?! Oh! It's because her only use for me is to show me off when I do good things or get good grades. So I come home and she's yelling her ass off at me. Then she says <b>I'm grounded from everything for spring break!!</b> Just because I didn't get an A. Can't she be proud that I got an A in Geometry, which I'm the only one in that class with an A, and an A in Grainger's Honors English class?!!?!??! She wouldn't stop bitchin' at me about how I have failed her, how stupid I am, and how she's ashamed of me. So I was taken back to school with a few minutes left in SAT Prep. At the end of the class, I went over and asked if there was anyway I could bring my grade up to an A. Mrs.Wallace said there's nothing to be done. I was about to break down and cry right there. I couldn't stand to go home to my bitch of a mom with that news. Mrs.Wallace saw that I was about to cry and she said, ""do you want to come in later and talk about it?"" and I was ""alright"" and went on through Photo. Photo helped me cheer up a bit because my friend Matt is a goof. After school I went to talk to Mrs.Wallace. Nothing happened. My grade is still a B. But I did told Mrs.Wallace all about my mom, revealing her evils. Mrs.Wallace was like ""your mom is crazy!"" Nothing could be done. My parents couldn't convience neither Mrs.Wallace or Mrs.Thornton to change my grade. I don't blame them for not changing my grade. If I deserve a B for my retarded quiz grades, then I get a B. I could serious care less if my grade is an A or a B. I just don't want to make enemies with my teachers. I'm proud of myself for getting 7 A's and 1 B. My dad is proud of me. My mom is pissed. She seems to be more pissed at my teachers than me now. Seeing that on the computer, I'm not grounded from ""everything"". 
I gotta go. Mom wants to talk about how to try to get my grade to an A. This is pointless. :(

I'd appreciate it if everyone from here on out would cut down on talking about him. It hurts to really think about the situation, because I probably never be able to be with him. It was nice to dream, but if this relationship is real, I have to get over him, I don't want it to hit me too hard when I find it is real, and I don't want to intrude on it. As long as he's happy, that's all that really matters. 

Alright next thing.. DORTHY HAS BEEN APROVED TO CHAPERONE MY FRIENDS AND I AT ANIME CONS!! My dad has only asked her questions through IM and talked to her on the phone, and he totally approves. He talked it over with my mom, and they found nothing wrong with her though. But my dad still plans to meet with her. The next con we're going to, and the first one Dorth gets to chaperone us is Anime-Mid Atlantic. The weekend right after school gets out for summer break! I'm excited! People who might be in mine and Dorth's room: Laura, Candace, Alexis and Emy. Lexi is going, just staying with her mom. Her mom is against a chaperone that she doesn't know know. 

Next... I got straight A's!!!! I think Katsucon helped me to achieve that! It was the only break in this dreaded 3rd marking period. Now I've only got one more marking period until the end of my sophomore year!! I usually do my worst in the last marking period because I get lazy. Lol.

So that's all for now. More updates coming later!"

So today at school, the fire alarm go off at the last two minutes of school! Somebody must've pulled it. The firetrucks came but didn't do anything.. but the fireman stood there and talk to a janitor. Emy and I were panicking because we were in the dark room for photography. We kinda left two of our prints there, and almost left our negatives there. Only thing interesting that happened all day.
Rest of the day was boring. I really can't wait to get my old lunch back on B days. I'd hate to say it, but I can't wait to get back to Ms.Wallace's class. Not because I like her, I still dislike her, but I just want my lunch back with Lexi, Stefan, Jen, Elizabeth, Colleen, etc etc. Those were the good times, and there were no crowded tables where people take your effin seats if you leave to get your lunch! I get my regular lunch back either Friday or Monday. I don't know if we're going to start Friday off with an A or B day because the marking period ends Thursday. Well, whatever.
I need to make some plans for this weekend. I want to try to see Alexis. I really hope I can! She's an amazing girl. 
I have two tests tomorrow... so I need to become a study slave tonight! WEEEE! I want some more fun in my life! I need to get my mom's pestering off my ass about studying and doing homework. She thinks thats all there is to do in the world. I know she means her best..kinda..but it's getting on my nerves and sometimes I need sometimes to relax and have FUN! Once this marking period is over, I can relax once again, thank God!

We also voice acted some of the yaoi manga she bought. Lol, that was super fun. Yes Laura!! We're gay guy lovers!! mmmmm... SEXY! &hearts;
I saw ""The Little Book of I Love You"" in Borders that Craig bought Faryne when I was at the mall with them, and I looked through it. I really liked it. I wanted to buy it for the guy I like.. but it's like $12.95. I swear I'll get it someday soon.. but my parents kinda talked about it with me. I told them about the book and who I wanted to give it to, and my mom was like, ""guys don't like sweet and sappy things! They like sex! Best bet is for you to give him that!!"" and my dad just didn't say much at all. Wow, so my mom is like giving me permission to go off and do it? Lol, fun. Well, this is coming from my mom who would go out with guys she didn't know because they asked her out and liked her. Who knows what she did before she married my dad. But anyway, I'll have to think about giving him that book. I would to recieve that book from a person who loves me and/or someone I'm in love with. But that's probably cuz I'm a girl. So guys reading this, tell me if you'd love it if a girl who liked you gave you a book like that.
Anyway, I went out taking pictures for photography today again. I think a second roll is due. Emy, if you read this, can you clarify this? 
So the marking period ends this week. Thursday to be exact. I hope I can keep my grades up and help pull them up too. I have A's and really high B's that are boarderlined A's in my classes. I think Katsucon helped me concentrate and enjoy school. Cons are like my drama rehab. Lol. I could use one right now though. I wish I could've gone to Tekkoshocon soooo badly!! But it's over now. 
In other news, I've been reading Death Note. Candace got me into it. I absolutely love it. I think L is cool, even though the book makes you want to cheer on Light more. Lol. 
Well, that's all for this entry, I've gotta get going to eat and then study and critque my roll #1 negatives.

I'm going to the mall with Laura and Steffy today! &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts; I know that will be an awesome adventure, even though I spent all my <b>$$$$</b> last night when I went with my dad. Last night, I went to Borders and got the Memoirs of a Geisha DVD!! It's <u>finally</u> out! I got the special edition with over 2 hours of extras!! Guess what Christa and her daddy are going to be doing tomorrow istead of homework! Lol. I also got Negima vol.8! I love that series! <b>:)</b>
So other things... school has been alright. A little drama here and there with a friend, but it's over now. And hey, you know, it's high school. There's no avoiding it. But everything is cool now, we're not talking to each other anymore. I have like... A's in all of my classes!! Well, my grade in Math dropped to a B.. 88.3 because I made really retarded mistakes on my last quiz..! Stupid Christa! Lol. Yesterday at school, we had a perfect attendance assembly. Free icecream! Steffy wasn't supposed to go, but he slipped out anyway. Lol. Ms.Parsons can be so oblivious sometimes! Then Lexi wasn't supposed to be there, but she went there on a bathroom pass from Mrs.B and got her icecream and went back to class. Lol. <b>I love my friends!</b> We there from <i>1:15-1:55!</i> I mean, it was nice to get out of Geometry, but still, it got  boring after a while!! Lol, but I had Steffy, Sarah, and a few other people I knew there to keep me entertained most of the time.
So yeah, I'm pretty much bored right now. So I think I'm going to find something to do and update later. I'll definitly take pictures at the mall like I usually do!

After two hours of almost getting it out... a bit of it was just hopeless to get off the curler!! So my parents pulled out the scissors because it was like 2:30am and my head was hurting really bad, so I took the scissors, and had to cut it. Don't worry, it's hardly noticable if I hide it right. It's just a little bit shorter than usual.. but some parts it's like really short, like it ends at the middle of my neck. So now I'm debating if I should go to a hair stylist and get it worked on or just wait for it to grow back out. I feel like I look retarded because some people were pointing it out today, so I think I should get it fixed.. I really don't want my hair to be short.. but it might have to be. So what do you guys think? Yes to getting it fixed and trimmed a bit.. or No and just let it grow back out? Hmm... we'll see.

They announced the cast of Mousetrap today. I was not casted. The reason is what really pisses me off..the student director casted all of his friends who are in every single fucking play at Broadneck and in Outcast Theatre. How could Whewell and Clarke let that happen?! WTF!! Whewell lead me on and made it seem like I was going to get a part. So I was excited and like... told everyone. Gave up Anime Club to Travis, and etc. I wouldn't be this sour if it wasn't for people getting up in my face and rubbing it in. Saying like ""YOU WEREN'T CASTED! YOU WEREN'T CASTED!! HAHAHAHA!!"" Mother fucking bitches! Then there is a certain person who really ticked me off about it. I won't get into that though. People think it's because I suck at acting. I really think I could've made it if Only Whewell was picking the cast. So, you're probably wondering how I found out that he picked his friends. A cast member told me, and another person who tried out and didn't make it who found out. So I called my dad in the hallway during 1st period, asking him to pick me up. Yeah, I was upset, I don't mean to be so sour about not making it, but when it comes to how people are treating me and who got in it, it freakin' pisses me off!! I was on the vurge of crying.. I couldn't concentrate 1st period. My dad said he would. I felt a little bit better. 2nd period, I got the pass to be picked up, but I go down to the office to find out that my dad isn't coming because the bridges to get out of Baltimore to Annapolis were blocked off and he was sitting in traffic for 30 minutes that was going absolutely. So he decided to drive back to work. So I went back in 2nd period about to cry... again. My group members asked me happened, and I told them. They were really nice and told me to call the people making fun of me fat asses. Lol. I had comfort from my closest friends all day, I felt special, but I still felt like shit, even though it's most likely not my fault that I didn't get in the play other than the fact that I'm not good friends with the student director. 
I hate high school immaturity. I wish I could just skip school tomorrow. To avoid all of the stupid remarks and all that bullshit. Not going to happen though. I'll just have to deal with it. Warning to all of the son of bitches who DARE to come up to me tomorrow to make fun of me and rub it in my face.. I'll get so pissed off at you that I could punch you in the fucking face! So don't bother!! 
Don't worry everyone who actually cares, I'll get over this in a few days..

Only four people showed up today, and tomorrow eight more people are to be expected to audition. Which means, I'll most likely get a part due to the lack of actors/actresses. 
Yes, this means giving up Anime Club for 2 months.. :'( I'm turning it over to vice president and best friend, Travis. :) I know he'll do a good job! Rehersals will be Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 2:10-4:00pm until the production, which will be every week, probably starting next week. So, call backs are Thursday, but only if Mr.Whewell needs to try you out for another role or just wants you to audition again for final decisions. The cast will be posted Friday morning. I can't wait! I really want to be the murderer if the murderer is a female part. I told Whewell that and he said ""I'll see what I can do about that!"" and winked at me! :) I really hope I get in this play!!!!!!! If I do, I'll be so flippin' happy!

On Friday, i came home and William came over cuz it was his birthday and he turned 16 and he got his car. He has got such a pimpin car its soo nice. And we drove around in it and we went to Cole's house and then to Cameron's house. Then I came home and packed and went over to Elisabeth's house in FlowerMound. And we jumped on the trampoline and got online, and attempted to play hacky sack. She kicked it and it hit me in the head...haha But I was soo super tired so I passed out before she did and her and the other two girls that were there watched Bambi..haha 

Then next morning we woke up at 6. Thats right 6 in the morning. What a joyyyy.. And we drove to the lake. We made a pit stop in Ennis to pick up Andrew and go to Starbucks..yesss. It was Elisabeth's birthday!! Shes 15 noww!! YAY! And we got 2 the lakehouse and we you know went out on the lake and went jetskiing and tubing and stuff. Seriously, I cant remember alot of it. We played with silly string, umm we got on top of the boat house and me and Ellie were singing..haha and we watched Gothika..soo freaky! But the rest I dont really remember. 

The next day, the guys came and woke us up and we jumped off the roof of the boat house like a bajillion times. Haha it was great. We went tubbing and jetskiing again. I am still soo sore from tubing. Ahh..but then we had 2 start getting ready to go home. We left at like 4 and I got home around 545. I was sad. I love Elisabeth so super much!

I took a shower cuz I smelled like crap..then Sawyer came with Ryan and we went out to eat at Kelly's. ((The resturant)) That was the first time Ive ever been there actually..It was pretty good haha. Then we came back and played pool @ my house..yeahh I lost. Then my mom needed something @ the grocery store so we had 2 go get it. That was actually pretty interesting.. haha But at dinner, they said I looked like a tomato because I was so burned..jeez, thanks guys..haha But they are really fun to be with even tho they make fun of mee..

I talked to Lauren and Robert when I got home! I was excited. I missed them so much while I was gone. But things with Steph doesnt seem the same anymore. It makes me sad. I still miss the Cruisers so much..

I seriously dont understand me right now. Its so retarded. Like I should be soo happy and I am but I duno. You could never tell. Im just in this..like zoned out wierd mood, and it seems like Im sad but Im not..I duno its so wierd and retarded..hah..

Today was good tho but there are so many tests and crap this week. Its kinda stressful..ahh jeezz

kEBB beautiful, your smile is in our hearts forever."

Today was a GREAT day! Except for third period. Geometry with Mrs Cox. Jeez just her makes my day worse. But seriously ok, this rumor about me having sex with my exboyfriend is really getting out of hand. It is totally not true. And Im suprised that some of you believe it! Most of you should know that I am totally NOT like that. And I would never ever have sex. But since most of you dont..Im telling you right now. And if you dont believe me fine, but HE knows the truth, and Hes the only one that matters! ((God)) hahaha

Sorry I had to get that out of my system. It was just really pissing me off. But yah I was sad but then I went to fourth period and that class just makes me so much happier!!! Ah I just love it. And I dont have any homework for the FIRST time all f-ing year!! GOSH haha

AHH this weekend is gonna be awesome. Im so excited. Its Ellies birthday on Saturday!! And were going to party @ the lake. AHH I havent seen Ellie in like a month so yah I am sooo looking forward to it! 

AH Cruisers. I swear guys, I miss you more and more everyday. I had that one song stuck in my head, I want a dude with the wickedest slam, I need a one, two, three holla man, haha that one and it reminded me of the cruise cuz I didnt like it before but then I listened to it and I remember Anaheim dancing to it in the club it was like her favorite song. Kinda a random thing for me 2 remember..lol but I do. And of course I was looking at pics today in class. I swear in some classes, its the only thing that gets me by..hahah AH theres not enough I can say. I love you guys so dearly!!

Ah so this day was kinda crazy. In first period, I was getting outta my chair and I was gonna put something up and I totally tripped on Chelsea's chair and landed on my butt. I am soo glad that there are only girls in that class. It was interior design haha 

Then OMG later, we were nominating people for Homecoming and Kelsey was like OMG Kebra always wanted to be Homecoming Queen so lets nominated her! And so we were like OMG yeah!! So we nominated her and Hunter Waychoff. And I yelled across the room, I was like hey guys nominate Kebra for the girl. And Mrs Cox..omg..she goes umm you need to vote for something that could ACTUALLY happen. We were like umm that could happen Mrs. Cox. We were all like looking at eachother going ""omg what a bitch"" but SERIOUSLY!!! UGHHH! Kebra could win!!

Ah things are so retarded right now. Its like not good. I dont like it. Its like wierd. Im so confused about everything. I duno things will get better tho..right?

Its so hard to be away from all these people. It makes me sad so much cus they make me feel so good inside. Like so happy. I know that if I were to be with them right now everything would be ok. Nothing would bother me. I just dont know how blessed I was to have spent a week with them. I would give anything to go back and do it all again. They are just all so amazing in their own way and us all put together is just totally something special. I will never forget it I love you guys more than you know.

Today was such a boring day. I cleaned up because we have people coming into town and I thought just maybe my mom would take me shopping..that plan didnt work too well. Then we were supposed 2 go up to the lake for a little while when my dad got home. He got home at like 6 so again..didnt work out. hahaha Then I took like an hour nap which was pretty good but I was woken by my phone singing ""save a horse ride a cowboy"" haha such a great song. Joy was calling me. I just love that girl. 

I was excited, I got to talk to Cole today. Hes such a pimp hahaha. I asked him if they had football in Canada. I think he got offended. But dude people have such stereotypes about Texas..seriously look @ this..
cArNivALcole: no you live in texas, do you competivly ride horses
cArNivALcole: or shoot guns?
...yeahhh thats it. And I was talking to Laurens little brother @ dinner one time((hes the coolest little kid)) and he was like ""our town is 4 square miles its not that big. Its probably as big as your ranch""..yeah because I have a ranch..hahaha

I also talked to Lauren! Which made me even more excited. I miss her so much! Haha we talked about how cool it would be to be on the Real World! Cause theres a new one..Real World Philidelphia. With not one but TWO gay guys..ohh mann...haha thats gonna be interesting.

Finally. jeezz haha and everyone said that they were gonna kick our ass..hah what now!? The game was awesome tho. But the stupid people with the like neon green shirts were making me mad. They were like move your blocking the way so we couldnt like stand around we had 2 sit in our seats and it was like SUPER crowded so it was kinda hard. and if you wanted to get up and go somewhere..good freaking luck it probably would take like 15 minutes to get out of the stands. But oh well. 

After the game people were talking about where they were going and some people said Taco Bell, some said Marble Slab and some said other places but seriously, me and mandy were driving around for like 30 minutes and noone was to be found. But there was some people @ starbucks. But still jeezz..haha

"event","Gosh, it seems that at night I get the most sad when I think about the cruise. I miss you guys soo much it hurts. The pictures dont even capture the wonderfulness of the moment it was taken. But I can remember it all like yesterday. The point and time when I met everyone. Lauren first. of course. I love her so much. I didnt know at that time that I would become so close to her but I did. Then Ryan and her cousin Alex. Too very awesome guys right there. Then I Cole. Gosh I miss that Canadian. Me and Lauren stalked him so bad but he didnt care. He knows he loves us. Then Robert. Which totally at that time I dindt think I would become so close to Robert. Bc at first Carrie sayd that him and the group he was with were being ""unsocialable"" so I figured he was just with his group and didnt want to go outside of it. This was TOTALLY not the case and Im sorry robert for thinking that. haha. I miss you and love you! Later..Me and Lauren meet the lovely Brian and Adi. haha We had some memorable times with you guys. Ahh but so much drama. I love you and miss you both so very much. Then the next night, me and lauren met the beautiful Steph and Lexi. So it was kinda us for @ the club that one night. And these black guys had a tape recorder and they were trying 2 get us to dance and they were like ""GO WHITE GIRL GO WHITE GIRL"" it was so funny cuz Steph was like IM ASIAN!!! ahhh we all became so close..even tho Lexi was with her family like 75% of the time. Her family was cool anyway. THe night @ the tAAlent show..hahha GOOO LEXIS MOM!!! GOO LEXIS DAD!! ahh that was great.. ohh goshh minasOOOOta you have no idea how much I miss you! i remember the rest of the night me and lauren were so hyper..we were saying ""minasOOOOta"" ""wAAnAA pOp?"" for like an hour ahh i miss your accent steph!!! almost as much as i miss you but only almost!! But later after we met Steph and Lexi we met James and Jordan..""Do you have any idea how hard my log is right now?""..moral of the story..dont dance with 13 yearolds to ""baby got back"" ahh that was so great!! i miss them tho!! And then Sabrina and Erica. Ah they were so young! yet they acted so super old! seriously, you could never tell. I still totally miss them anyway. And somewhere along theline we met Derrick. Who is so totally awesome. haha I miss him super much too. Haha i still remember the night that me and Lauren met Tony. hahha It was like 2 in the morning...he was so slow tho seriously...""friendship??"" hahahah but i still miss him! everytime me and lauren were like YE YE YEAHHH and starting acting black, out would come tony(he was black) out of fcuking nowhere. we would always start cracking up. I dont think he ever knew what we were laughing about tho bc he was so slow.  and sometime like the 2nd day me and Lauren met nick! he was really quiet tho. And he met Steph..what lovebirds aww i miss nick too!!I rember the night of the hawaiian party. when we meet pierre. haha me and lauren were talking 2 them and they were like yall look like 6. we were like thankkss.. but thats the night that i stayed up till like 730 with those sketchy guys..most def not a good move. OMG and i remember the day that T-baby said that thing to me and lauren about something with the lil thirst guy and the other one..nevermind you wouldnt get it. haha ahh there are just so many memories that i will most def never forget and its so hard to even put all of them here. like the one time with crystal when she had a LITTLE to much to drink in cozymel..haha we saw a side of her weve never seen before. and also the fact that we got the nerve to talk to alex the night before the last day of the cruise. how totally gay are we. but it was pretty wierd of him to lie 2 us/lauren like that..ohh well..ughh so many memories and not even enouf words to express the greatness of it all..i will never ever forget you guys and you have no idea how much you mean to me. i love you all soooo much...we are all so totally gonna work on that same ship until we die and marry each other. and fo sho have kickass crew partys...ahh i cant wait to be with yall again.."

Ahh out on the lake again tomororrow and then school! Geez. For some reason none of this seems real..maybe its so amazing yet so weird that it just seems so impossible. Everything that has been happening seems impossible though. I guess once again, nothing is impossible. 

Its so wierd tho to think about how you would never think that somethings would happen and they do and your like what the hell?? haha I dont even know if that made any sense. ohhh well

haha I said I was happy at the beginning of this thing and it seems like Im sad. But Im not. I actually cant explain what I am right now. Its like when your like not sad but stressed, and like not mad but confused, and not excited but happy..I dont know if Im even making sense. haha yeah Im tired. I havent been sleeping very well thanks to my sickness..ehmm lauren..

The last week was like a tornado I swear. Everything was good and perfect then all at once it came crashing down horribly but now it seems that everythings beginning to be better. I like when things are better. I dont like to be sad. And I dont like when other people are sad. Infact I hate when other people are sad. It makes me sad All I wanna do is make them happy.

Speaking of fortune cookies..about 3 weeks ago I went out to eat with a friend and we had Panda Express. And I broke the cookie and read the fortune and it said ""You will find hidden treasures where you least expect it."" And I looked up and saw my hidden treasure! So I most def believe in fortune cookies now..

On Friday, i came home and William came over cuz it was his birthday and he turned 16 and he got his car. He has got such a pimpin car its soo nice. And we drove around in it and we went to Cole's house and then to Cameron's house. Then I came home and packed and went over to Elisabeth's house in FlowerMound. And we jumped on the trampoline and got online, and attempted to play hacky sack. She kicked it and it hit me in the head...haha But I was soo super tired so I passed out before she did and her and the other two girls that were there watched Bambi..haha 

Then next morning we woke up at 6. Thats right 6 in the morning. What a joyyyy.. And we drove to the lake. We made a pit stop in Ennis to pick up Andrew and go to Starbucks..yesss. It was Elisabeth's birthday!! Shes 15 noww!! YAY! And we got 2 the lakehouse and we you know went out on the lake and went jetskiing and tubing and stuff. Seriously, I cant remember alot of it. We played with silly string, umm we got on top of the boat house and me and Ellie were singing..haha and we watched Gothika..soo freaky! But the rest I dont really remember. 

The next day, the guys came and woke us up and we jumped off the roof of the boat house like a bajillion times. Haha it was great. We went tubbing and jetskiing again. I am still soo sore from tubing. Ahh..but then we had 2 start getting ready to go home. We left at like 4 and I got home around 545. I was sad. I love Elisabeth so super much!

I took a shower cuz I smelled like crap..then Sawyer came with Ryan and we went out to eat at Kelly's. ((The resturant)) That was the first time Ive ever been there actually..It was pretty good haha. Then we came back and played pool @ my house..yeahh I lost. Then my mom needed something @ the grocery store so we had 2 go get it. That was actually pretty interesting.. haha But at dinner, they said I looked like a tomato because I was so burned..jeez, thanks guys..haha But they are really fun to be with even tho they make fun of mee..

I talked to Lauren and Robert when I got home! I was excited. I missed them so much while I was gone. But things with Steph doesnt seem the same anymore. It makes me sad. I still miss the Cruisers so much..

I seriously dont understand me right now. Its so retarded. Like I should be soo happy and I am but I duno. You could never tell. Im just in this..like zoned out wierd mood, and it seems like Im sad but Im not..I duno its so wierd and retarded..hah..

Today was good tho but there are so many tests and crap this week. Its kinda stressful..ahh jeezz

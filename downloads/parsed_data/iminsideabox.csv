"event","im not usually much for letting shit out... and i havent talked much abotu this...

but its officially 3 months and i feel i need to get some shit out

i lost a brother that night... the brother i always wanted
i really looked up to nick, he was seriously my idol... everything i hoped i could be
he was barely even older then me but so much more of a man... and i hope one day i can begin to even follow in his footsteps
vince and dan... if you read this, i want you to know, i consider you both a brother to me. i consider you a part of this family, and im sure every one else feels the same way. i dont care if we ever get close or anything, but if you ever need anything this family is there for you. you would have been a part of this family anyways, and as far as im concerned you both are

we werent as close as we could have been, i know there are friends of his out there that knew him for years and were closer then i should have been, but i felt that there would always be tomorrow to talk more... but even though we didnt know everything about eachother, i truely felt me and nick were cut from the same stock. i saw a lot of the qualities i have in him and i hope he saw some of himself in me... it would truely be an honor if he did

i really saw nick as a mirror of myself... only a better version. nick was such a better person then i could ever hope to be, i hope one day i can be more like him and.. fuck i dont even know.

i just really wish nick was still here and i could tell him this shit

i hate seeing my sister go through the pain of this every fucking day
she puts on the strong face, like we all do, but we all know what the fuck is going on
its going to take a life time to get over this
honestly i dont ever want to
i want to know this feeling i have inside and use it to hopefully better myself as a person and live a better life


l.o.v.e.l.i.f.e.
RIP Nick"

we made all the plans today
my head isnt on straight but this is what i remember:

the viewing is from 6-9 at forest lawn
on wednesday. its going to be open casket
so you will all get to say good bye. if you dont
want to ""see"" him i think you should still come 
and hang out. there will be pics and a slide show.
i HIGHLY suggest coming, it gives amazing closure 
to see him one last time. and he looks soooooooooo
beautiful...trust me <9


the ceremony is going to be on thursday
at 3. its going to be outside at forest law
and a beautiful ceremony. for those who 
REALLY knew nick....you knew he didnt
believe in GOD [[like most of us]] so its going to
be a celebration of his life. you know he would
want us all to smile and remember the good.
after that we will ALL go to his house for drink,
stories, and good times :D


we will have a basket at ALL the things for those
who want to bring cards for nick. the more the 
better <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3



so ya.. if you just want to pay your respects to one of the greatest people that walked this earth, come"

"event","i gotta go to work in a few minutes which is absolutely delightful.  luckily i am off tomorrow.  just quickly wanted to run down a few things that suck:

1)  Having to stay at FYE because the other job i got does not have benefits.
2)  The Yankees are already 1-1, they should not lose again this year!
3)  Rain.
4)  All but about 5 or 6 people in the world.
5)  School...i have too much work to do.
and most importantly...
6)  The fact that I thought I was done with it, but I am not!!!!  What is it about this one.............

Off to hell, i mean work, now!

"event","AL is in ALfred right now visting 2 very special ladies in his life.  It makes me quite happy.  It is nice not having to work or go to school at all this week...however, when i go back, it will probably be a shock to the system.  especially since I have tons and tons of work to do the next few weeks, which sucks, but for the time, i am not gonna think about it, i am just gonna enjoy my time here...i haven't seen these guys in 5 years!  if you are looking for me, which i am sure nobody is...feel free to call my cell...if you don't have the number that probably means i never liked you enough to give it to you! hahaha...

"event","guess what i did yesterday?  that's right, i got hit in the ankle with a BRICK!  that hurt a lot.  i hate when you wake up and you don't know if a dream really happened or not, and then when you realize that it was just a dream, it sucks because you wish it did happen...or do i??  anyway, i have very little going on right now which is not a bad thing i guess.  i am going to try to get a job today, so keep those fingers crossed!  and hopefully i am gonna go away for a few days after that, maybe tomorrow.  i must find out.  i like not working the last couple of days, life without fye is a fine thing.  the one bad thing about not working is it gives me too much time to sit around thinking and we know when al thinks too much, he usually gets sad.  :(  ""Sometimes silence can seem so loud.""

"event","you ever feel like you fuck everything up?  i sure do!  i always feel like i can't win, no matter what it is that i am doing.  just when things started to look kind of good again, i let someone really important down.  i hate feeling that i let someone down, and i know you will tell me that i didn't, but i know deep down that i did and i am sorry!  on a brighter note, it is snowing and my class will probably get cancelled tonight meaning that my spring break will officially begin when that phone rings.  i am going to visit 2 people that i absolutely love and miss more than anything next week, so i am very excited about that!  and i heard from the job that i want, i am gonna go there before work tomorrow to talk to them.  hopefully that works out...so maybe things are starting to look up...until i fuck it up!!!"

"event","I am supposed to be doing homework, but instead I decided to sign up for my own journal.  I got jealous of people with them, now I am one of you!  So aside from the fact that I can now write what's on my mind here, nothing else is going to well.  I have to find a new job.  I hate my job and am gonna be quitting within the next few days.  School sucks, people suck...I have decided it is probably best not to trust anyone.  I realize that every time I open myself up to someone, I wind up either looking like an ass, or getting hurt...and frankly I am sick of it.  So from now on, I am gonna be ALone!  There are very few people in the world that matter to me anyway, and unfortunately that list continues to shrink.  I gotta find something to do with my life and fast!  So, I shall continue on my quest for a job and hell, maybe I will find some people that won't turn their backs on me on the way!  I will leave you with a quote from 8 mile...""All's well that ends ok, so I'll end this shit with a Fuck You but Have a Nice Day!"""

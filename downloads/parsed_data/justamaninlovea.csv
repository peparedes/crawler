"event","You know I hate that care about you so much. I hate that even when ur mad at me and I am mad at you that can seriously be mad because my heart wont allow me to feel anger for you. I hate that I love you so much and you make my love feel so unrequited that I dare question the reasons I struggle everyday from saying the two words that would make our long battle scarred relationship seem to ephemeral; IT'S OVER. I mean you give me all the right reasons to leave but I deny them because i believe something greater is instore for the future. What is this greatness I'm looking for? Hell if i know. But for some reason my belief in it gives me the strength to prevent myself from saying FUCK YOU! There has to be an easier way to love you and I guess thats what i am believing in but this is obviously killing me inside because my fingers are trembling as I type this. I can keep goin but im gonna save it and put it paper..."

"event","... It really ruins the morning for me also. *sad face* I think im about ready for something new also. But what about all the promises i made? I know you could give a shit about them but its a lil different on my side of the universe. Im a man of my word and giving this up could ruin it all. Fuck it! Its always been up to you to decide everything for us. Why waist my time stressing over this shit? I wouldnt wanna break tradition. You go, then I go. Guess its your turn now babe...I love you."

""It Don't Have To Change""
(feat. The Stephens Family)

Oh do you remember (ooh)
When the family was everything? (ooh)
Oh do you remember? (ooh)
It was so long ago and so much has changed (ooh)
I wanna go back (go back...ooh)
Wanna go back to those simple days (ooh)
I wanna go back (go back...ooh)
But now we've grown and gone our separate ways

(aah)
Times is hard (times is hard)
And things are a changin'
I pray to God
That we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No it don't have to change

Do you remember (ooh)
Back at Grannie's house on Christmas Day? (ooh)
Help me sing...
Do you remember (ooh)
How we'd gather 'round and sing all day? (ooh)
I wanna go back (go back...ooh)
To playing basketball and football games
I wanna go back (go back...ooh)
To yesterday but it's not the same

Times is hard (times is hard)
And things are a changin'
I pray to God
That we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No it don't have to change

"event","Well today pretty much sucked. I am still having stupid fucked up arguments wit my mom and it really sucks. She just doesnt seem to understand me. She thinks that by giving me money and buying me things is doing soo much but when it come down to it, she really doesnt even know me. I would rather my mom understand who I am then just buy me everything. I mean i was thinkin, she doesnt even know what my favorite tv show it, she doesnt know my favorite food, she doesnt know my favorite color. She doesnt know anything about me. I think that I got all my genes from my dad cuz its like mom and I are 2 different species. She doesnt like any of the things I like. We have nothing in common. She is nothin like me. She is very loud and rude and she raises her voice everytime I try to have a decent conversation with her. When my dog got hit by a car today, she laughed.

You just dont know how much I wish you were here with me cuz you are the only one that understands. Thats why I love you."

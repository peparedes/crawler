Luckily I had landed on a mat, but apparently I nearly killed one of the CPR practice dolls. I was out longer this time than in September. I completely blacked out and dont remember falling or anything. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital and I said, im fine, but they wouldnt let me sit up. Then they took my blood pressure and I ate some smarties. It was awesome. Fainting is fun, I should do it all the time.

But lets not forget. So often I find myself searching for a memory that doesnt exist because I didnt let myself actually live, so no memory was made. i have many memories of laughter and of pain. Very few of embarrassment, because I wouldnt take a chance, and also very few memories of really letting someone in closer than is comfortable. 

Walls. So many fucking walls. Its interesting though, because you can climb the walls and when you stand on top and really look around, instead of just scaling down the other side, you see that to get down you should really jump.
And jump far.

Apparently I have courage. I did what i did because I felt it necessary.

Ive felt so shaky since friday. I have no idea whats going to happen. This is what life should always be like. 
And there will be falling, and pain and disappointment. 
There will be moments that feel like theyre out of a movie.  only really those moments in movies that you think of, are just the moments that feel so close to what life should be, that we remember them.
So moments full of life.
Moments full of breath. Intake of breath.
And blushing, red cheeks and giggles. FEAR and excitement, nerves and anticipation.

i dont know what Im doing with my life!


and its delicious."

"event","Now that I think about it, Im actually quite sad that I'm no longer 17 and never will be again. I loved that age. Age isn't important, but it is a beautiful number, its musical, its like a banana flavoured popsicle.


This is the first day of my life.
No its not.
But if it were, oh if.

Ive eaten 4 popsicles today. They are 50 cents at the store around the corner. So I frequently run to the store. come on, 50 cents for pure frozen joy? in good time good sir.

Im so fucked up about food. I just wanted to state it once more for my own benefit. Im ok, I take care of myself. I just like to note that even then, or now I guess, even now I just cant get my head back into a somewhat sane relationship with food. Maybe I never really had one to begin with. Interesting. 

What does one do with 6 years? Beyond waste them?

I suddenly feel so young.

You know whats sad? 
Missing the days that I dont remember, or the strings of weeks that all stick together in my head, like book pages or photographs. i know things happened, but its vague and the specifics are gone, beyond numbers. numbers and lists that are imprinted in my brain that i doubt will ever become dislodged. I think what I like best about the past 6 months, is the fact that I no longer feel like it was ever really worth it. I actually got nothing out of torturing myself.

I miss it. but stupidly. its like missing a drug. im really just talking because I can. ive got nothing constructive to say.

the more i think upon it, the more i realize that i realize nothing. i dont know anything.

and thats ok.
its very possible that im just going to run right back into my box and stay there out of fear.
and unfortunately, thats been ok for a very long time.

(drumroll please)
duddududdududududududududduddudududududududdududd.....
........dududududududdudud..........

Yes i gave blood! and that was officially the weirdest impulsive thing Ive done. well...not really, but it was just so random. First week of school, whats my top priority? Giving blood! 

So the needles they use are much bigger than the ones they use when doctors order a blood test. It was like they were shoving a straw in my arm. I am exagerating. but you can definitely feel this one. So immediately i felt a little sick and faintish, which is why you lie down to do it. And for a moment I wanted to rip it out of my arm and run to the door. but then i just concentrated on my breath and it was ok. except it took so long for me to reach the quota that i began to get nervous that they weren't watching it and that i would be left completely dry before they noticed. (that didnt happen, just so you know)and then my fingers started to turn blue, which was a little shocking seeing as it was summer.

Eventually I managed to pump enough blood out. Apparently my blood pressure was low so thats why i took so long. Anyway, they got me to sit up slowly. and i felt fine. then i stood and felt fine. So they took me to the table where you sit and eat cookies and juice. and as i sat down they told me to tell them if i felt anything. I said, Im fine. and as i lifted the peach juice to my mouth my head felt warm all of a sudden. but i thought, (Stubbornly) it will pass, ill be ok. and i thought if i just focused on something on the wall id be fine. and then i felt sick and my vision went funny and then the next thing i know there is a nurse beside me and ive got my head between my knees and then they put me on a bed and they were putting cold clothes on me. and i told the nurse that, actually, im quite cold. so they gave me a blanket. and i remember them saying something about me looking like porcelain, i was so pale. and another one said, she looked like that on the way in.

and i laughed. and had some water. and then i felt ok. and i went and bought a smoothie. and books. the latest in the Georgia Nicholson series, And Then He Ate My Boy Entrancers. and a Dictionary/Thesaurus. and the Tao Te Ching.

The moral of the story is to make sure you eat plenty before giving blood. and bring a sweater if it is air conditioned. and maybe take someone with you your first time. And if your lucky, like me, youll get to walk around like a prat with a little ""first time!"" sticker shaped like a blood drop on your shirt whilst strolling around chapters."

The way you read things
The way you see things
The way you reach things
Hurts my heart

Oh, I fear
Somehow you'll find the need
To spit out my name
Like a watermelon seed

And, oh, sometimes
I think 'what am I doing?
This business of bleeding'
A dime for showing
My heart

Oh, twin moon

Take me up-sky
So I can kiss you
Drink your starlight

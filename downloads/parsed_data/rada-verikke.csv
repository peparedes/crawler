"event","This week has been bad for my head. I swear, it's been a perpetual headache. First the dominating psion. Then evil leaking Shai madness. Then infectious frog-people. Then HORRIBLE SCREAMING MADNESS IN MY HEAD. I wonder how much I'd have to pay the wizard to have him cast Mind Blank on me every day. 

Anyway ... there was a Karian blackguard challenging Rial to a duel over the Avatar's Blade. Rial said something diplomatic and fluffy about it ""not being his to bargain with"" and the blackguard said, ""Ok. I expected this. War then! Ta!"" and went off. 

Then we flew the Tower off. (No, that was not us ""running away."" We had to go to Allatine so that we'd be closer to the Shai with the sky droplet. And the wizard did some wizard fu thing that told him that the essence of the Mindbender was the same place the HORRIBLE STAR EVIL was coming from. So either they're using the Mindbender to ... bend something that's sending horrible star evil here, or the Mindbender is a Star (which had fucking better not be true, because if the Mindbender is a Star, then he saved us just so that we would go do some set of things he wanted us to do which means we've been FOLLOWING HIS PLAN ALL ALONG. I swear, if the Mindbender has been working for the Stars all al ... hm. I suppose he could have sent us on a long path to stop Vace because that way we'd stop the People Trying to Keep The Sky Up ... Damn. Now I'm confused. See? This is why Lareth went bad.) ... or the Mindbender is just generally powerful and badass so they've kidnapped him. Or some other possibility because now I've lost track. 

Anyway, Nika re-made the Rainbow Blade, which is called Eovelgar! *ominous music* Ahem. Cue the ancient Ioktar lesson of the day: ""Eovelgar"" means ""that which cuts"", which sounds less impressive in Common. However, note the significance of the -ar instead of the normal -ran ending. ""eovelgran"" means also ""that which cuts"" but has a connotation of ""the sharp thing"" - a sharp object which had been referred to earlier in the conversation or something. And usually ""eovelgran"" would be followed by <i>what</i> it cuts - wood, metal, people, etc. ""Eovelg<b>ar</b>"" connotes that there would be no word following - Eovelgar is that which cuts everything and anything. So I promise you the name is cooler than it sounds. End lesson. Also, the blade is like ludicrously shiny and amazing. That is an epic weapon, I'm telling you. 

So then we went to the Shai and Nika cut us a big hole in it and chaos started leaking out as soon as the hole opened up. Migrane-inducing chaos, I should add. And then we wandered in and Clarence discovered that he could create a bubble of Not Horrible Chaos so that we wouldn't have to worry about our ears turning into pumpkins or anything. And so we'd, you know, have air to breathe. We met some giant frog guy and I think there was a bad pun about ""hosting"" somewhere but I was too headachy to appreciate it.  

And then, we came to The Place that the Sky Droplet was supposed to be. And it had a giant glowing eye-of-Ramit symbol and apparently Ramit was the one who put the Droplet here. There was a sign that said something like ""Here lies something Ramit borrowed a long time ago. Only those who live in His Way may look upon it."" And there were two panels you could push. And there was this huge deal about who was going to push the panels and Rial kept trying to push them and they'd go in like an inch and then pop back out and Nataya kept telling me to do it because I was the rogue and Ramit is the god of rogues but he's the god of lots of other things and I'm supposed to be Tellia's child and confusion was everywhere.  

So I finally said, ""Look. Here's a coin. Heads, I push the left panel. Tails, I push the right panel."" And I flipped the coin - 

And the door opened before it hit the ground. That was pretty cool. 

Then, we entered this beautiful room full of treasure and fancy tapestries and paintings and stuff. And the Sky Droplet was sitting there on a pedestal in the middle of the room. Oh, and the room had a bunch of blue pillars against the wall. And the compass went crazy, spinning around really fast. And there was a plaque on the bottom of the pedestal that said something like, ""Only the worthy should touch the Sister's Tear"" or something. I don't think Ramit has a sister, so I'm not entirely sure what that meant. But anyway, I was still on my ""must be thiefly"" kick, so I searched the room, and there was this lever! So i flipped another coin, and then I pushed the lever! And then there was this big sound of SOMETHING HAPPENING - and the roof of the building opened, and the Sky Droplet went clear! And everybody went, ""Oh no! Rada! You broke it!"" but then the pillars started to ... drain. It turned out that the first Sky Droplet was just an illusion, and the real Sky water was in the pillars around the room. The water poured from the roof into the now-empty Sky Droplet ... bowl. So go me. 

Then we stood around for a while being confused as to how to lift the thing. ""Push it into the portable hole"" was our answer. :) 

And then, we left. And we got attacked by some demons on the way out who wanted us to be presented to Dread Queen Aaberiouaisosjr or whatever her name was. We were all like, ""Oh fine"" at first, but then Rial was all, ""Whoa! That's a lotta evil! I smite you now!"" and then there was a lot of them doing HORRIBLE DOOM and I was struck by HIDEOUS NIGHTMARE MADNESS and by the time my brain put itself back together the nalfshnee were dead and there were like fifty bazillion vrock trying to kill everybody and we Shadow Walked and started trying to run the hell away. 

Gee, my shadow-penmanship kinda sucks."

_Completely_ failed to hit the stupid drow. Even _with_ Shadowsbane. See, if Taarn had not been such an idiot and _died_, we wouldn't be having these problems. Sigh ... poor Taarn.

But man, you should have seen Rial. Now that was amazing. *whack* *slam* *kapow* ... It was like ... like ... paladin on freakin' _fire_, man.  He and Nataya ... Ok, Nataya prayed with her hippie drugs or something (I didn't really understand it, but she got really loopy for a while and then she said her spells were going to be extra explody and I _thought_ she was just on crack but apparently the dust really is magical) ... And then there was this horrible storm of longspears (Nataya claimed they were ""quills"" but these were freakin' <i>javelins</i>, man) ... And then for a few seconds there was a pincushion where Maedra had been flying. And then Rial glowed with holy power and Lo, Did the Paladin Righteously Smite the Evil Drow Queen. There was a <i>lot</i> of smiting. It was great. 

The wizard, like, disappeared into a corner or something. Maybe he could teach me more rogue tricks, 'cause he's a damn sight better at hiding than I am. 

We met the Velvet Paw! They have a <i>cannon</i>! I need a cannon. I have to build a cannon. Dude. Cannons. 

We're wanted in Paisha again. What a surprise. I totally see why Vace went bad."

I managed to get jumped by six guards trying to get out of the city because I am the least observant rat in the WORLD. My ancestors are rolling in their unmarked graves.  Fortunately, despite my thorough lack of skill, humans are still _slow_ and I am still a _rat_.

"event","I tried to leave. They wouldn't let me. I don't understand. I'm going to hurt them again, and what if they can't stop me the next time? It's not like I help ... I don't bring anything to the group. I spend all their money. I'm useless in battle. I can't bring down lightning bolts. I don't speak to animals. I can't speak to <i>people</i>. And I'm nothing like Taarn. His destiny shines ... like, well, a rainbow. 

Why did I survive the massacre of the Brotherhood? My four companions get along so well, work so well together. I want to belong. I want to matter. But I have so many failures ... My failure to notice the skrik ambush. My failure to find the secret door into Ginvad. My failure to disarm the traps in the tunnels. My failure to save Rial from the Tethmos. My failure to be there when Jathris and his companions attacked ... Sigh. I can't leave. As guilty as I feel for the thousand harms I've caused, I'd feel more guilty if something happened that I could have stopped. At the very least, I can suffer strikes that might have hit another one of us. I must redeem myself. Trying to be better will help me to have a stronger heart ... won't it? Please?"

"event","... and I <u>killed</u> him. ... I didn't kill him. He got back up with only Nataya's powers. But he nearly died, and <i>my</i> blades had done it. 

I knew all his weaknesses. In that moment, when he was my worst enemy, I knew exactly how to hit him. The way he moves his elbow out too far when he swings his sword around ... the way a feint to his shoulder always makes him pull his shield up and expose his knees...

He's saved my life so many times. And I nearly <u>take</u> his. How weak am I, that my mind was turned so easily? And I have <i>no</i> way of preventing it from happening again. Next time, will I be so lucky as to only <i>almost</i> kill Rial? 

Taarn has said he understands - that he felt the pull of its evil too and was swayed by it. But Taarn didn't have to look at the daggers in his paws, see them stained with a paladin's blood."

"event","Paisha's pretty big. We went to the Emerald Blade. They have good grog there. I went to the Temple of Tellia. I gave them the rest of my money. It was only five plat, but now I'm officially absolutely broke. Sigh. Why can't I stop spending money? I've gone through more coin than the rest of the group put together. What gives? I keep spending it on the wrong things, I guess. All those cure lights I bought never got used. Hm, maybe next temple of Tellia I can donate them. They'll actually get used that way. 

Aww, and I still have all those explosives and no one to blow up. 

Tellura, by the way, is a punk. We tried to invite her to dinner at the Emerald Blade to ""celebrate Taarn's birthday"" (awww, little psywar's growing up...) but she punted because she was off saving the world from people trying to kill Vace Kazzul or something. So now we have to meet her at the World Alliance headquarters - her base, of course."

I ... wish this still felt like home. Being here has given me this horrible feeling. I'm even less like these people than I remember. I have fur; I have a tail ... but it's like whatever's inside me isn't really a skrik. Why, Ranskari? Why did you make me this way? 

Sigh. Taarn bought me food to take up with me - some mush- and puffballs. That's one thing I approve of. Real skrik food. At least we know how to eat. I bought some explosives too. Hope I don't blow up Rial again."

Well, I also blew up Rial and made a wall fall on Sialyre. Sigh. Any ten year old could have disarmed those traps. Being reminded of my failures as a skrik, my failure to be the son and the mage Ranskari needed. Tellia, what were you <i>doing</i>? No, that's a silly question. You're a goddess of good; of course you wouldn't make me a proper skirk. Father, what were <i>you</i> doing? Why did you call a human goddess to make you a rat? You must have known she would not give you what you wanted. Was it just our family's madness that made you call the priestess in?"

Clearly I have to stop talking to people. I should take statistics on how many of my conversations end in me getting attacked."

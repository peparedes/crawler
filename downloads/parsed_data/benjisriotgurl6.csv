<P><FONT color=#000099><STRONG><lj-cut text=""The fucked up shit that happened today!!""><BR>Ok first of all we (nicholas and I) were moving boxes to the car and then we took them to the new house to unload and when we came back to get more, Kim and her FAT daughter was there, her fucked in the head son, and some little boy they were watching(who would let then watch there kids i dont kno) and my asshole father and my sis. then my brother(nicholas) mom showed up to pick them up but Brittany(sis) want to stay with Kim (WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHY) so i had to put more boxes in the car by myself which i didnt mind... but then kim decides to sit on the porch step and then tells her son to sit next to her so i have to fuckin squeeze through with heavy as fuck boxes and carry them all the way out to the street cuz she wont move her fuckin van out of the driveway.BITCH! so when i was finally done we went to the new house and unload, then went the store then to get some food. and we were going to come home and eat if the BITCH was gone but they were still there so we want back over by are new house to eat, but then Tim tells us that my uncle is lookin for us,so we had to go back over to the house, so we did and when we were pullin up i noticed a necklace around Kristens(kims fat daughter) and she hadnt had a necklace on earlier, then when i want on the house so did not have it on no more. so i want up stairs and all 3 of my necklaces are gone, i was ready to fuckin kill someone. so i went and told my uncle and he went in the house and confronted her but she said she didnt take it and kim said tell her to look harder cuz her room is a mess... that says right there that they were in my room cuz how the hell would they no that my room was a mess unless they were in there and plus when i want up there to check for my necklaces the door was opened and i had closed it.so i was searchin my room so more n never found them, then i went back outside to the car and my g-ma told my uncle that Justin(kims fucked in the head son) had ran past the car and said ""u big fat liar"" so my uncle said something to him and he of course said ""i didnt say that""so then Kristen was out by the van and see heard it and ran in and told her mom and then screamed out the door that ""u guys need to stop lying"" and i said ""Shut the fuck up bitch"" and she like ""u shut up u little slut"" and i was like "" me the slut look what the fuck u are wearin u fat ass""( she had on some SHORT ASS SHORT and a tank shirt) and im not lying she is as big as a HIPPO!so anyways she said something esle im not sure what cuz i was just like""SHUT THE FUCK UP"" so her mom started to come out and my uncle said to get leave so we did and kristen was like ""james(which is my dad) do something say something to her"" and we were pullin away and i was like ""i dare u to say something to me"" then we went over to the new house and i was in tears! then shortly after my uncle shows and was like ""kim told james to come over and tell u off or he cant live with her"" and i guess my uncle said ""u better not show or say shit to her cuz i will beat ur ass"" so they came and sat around the block and then my dad come up and they were all agruing at one point Tim stepped to my dad and i was right there i backed up real fast and i was screamin at my dad that i wanted my necklaces and he said "" ill get them back"" i was like ""yeah right u let her call me a Slut and kim why the hell would u get my necklaces back"" then kim called the Police AGAIN! which was stupid ass fuck cuz her daughter stole my stuff and thet had came over to us and Tim as had problems with her b4 and she said to the police ""we came over to talk to someone that has been harassin us"" DAMN SHE is fuckin stupid.but anyways they left shortly after and the police never came. so when we finally want back home they were still there so we had to wait for them to leave and my dad come over and tryed to started talkin all nice to my g-ma WTF? and i told him i want my stuff back and he was like u r my daughter i will get it back. im like WOW u actully remember that im ur daughter! so yeah it was a really fucked up day and I never did get my necklaces! i m so fuckin pissed!<BR></lj-cut><BR></STRONG></FONT></P>

              *Die For Love*
""Sit in the park were i dwell for this boy i love so well, he took my heart away from me now he wants to set me free. i see a girl on his lap he says things to her that he never said to me. I ran home to cry on my bed not a word to mother was said, father came home late that night he looked me from left to right, he saw me hanging from a rope he took his knife to cut me down and on my dresser a note was found:Dig my grave, dig it deep, dig my grave from head to feet and on the top place a dove and remember this i died for love...""

here are the lyrics to this  really great Godsmack song 



Artist: Godsmack 
Album: Faceless 
Title: Serenity (Acoustic) 
 

As I sit here and slowly close my eyes
I take another deep breath
And feel the wind pass through my body
I'm the one in your soul
Reflecting the light
Protect the ones who hold you
Cradling your inner child

It's serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when I thought mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

Tragic visions slowly stole my life
Tore away everything
Cheating me out of my time
I'm the one who loves you

No matter wrong or right
And every day I hold you
I hold you with my inner child

It's serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when I thought mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

Where do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
Why do we dream when I thought mean nothing
And when will we learn to control

I need serenity [x2]"

school has never been so boring.i was so bored during 1,2,3,4 periods then the teacher let me go to the bathroom in and i never came back it was a blocked class 4-6 so i left 4th and i want to my friends class and stayed there. was more funnier then sitting in my classroom where no one talked to me. but yeah i dont wanna go tomorrow i dont no why i am but yeah, maybe i wont. I have a new favorite song its ""Just Like you"" by - Three Days Grace. i just love that song. here are the lyrics

I could be mean 
I could be angry
You know i could be just like you

I could be fake
I could be stupid
You know i could be just like you
(chorus)
You thought you were standing beside me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be 
Just like you

I could be cold
I could be ruthless
You know i could be just like you

I could be weak 
I could be senseless
You know i could be just like you

(chorus)

On my own, cause i cant take livin with you
I'm alone, so i won't turn out like
you want me to"

So we went and got a dark brown hair dye and the cashier lady was laughing at me, and i got very pissed and walked out of the store! She made me very upset. So anyways when we dyed over it with dark brown the highlights became a darker red of course. But i dont like it! So im dying it this purple redish color thats really cool! But i gotta leave in these highlights for awhile so i dont screw up my hair. but yeah just thought id say that. Peace!"

I guess Melissa and I had our first fight last night.  It's funny no matter how hard you try, sometimes things just don't turn out as you thought they could.
She hurt me again.  I don't know why.  I know something happened.  My friends saw her last night.  She never called like she said she would.  And she still hasn't.  I don't know why.  Kinda like I have no clue why I'm writing this.
Justina called today.  I told her what's happened in the last few days.(everything).  She had some interesting insights.  
I know I'm not writing this to a Journal.  I'm writing this to a girl.  I don't know why things have gone down this way.  Maybe my writing is showing my state of mind... in a jumble of thoughts.

I'm not angry.  I feel hurt, used, stupid, confused, weak, tired, lonely, and ignored.

I want to forgive her.  But what about trust?  I gave her something I can never ever give anybody else.. and if I waited this long, it must have meant something to me.

Most of all, I'm wondering why she hasn't called me yet.  Or even showed up to talk to me.  

Why?...

Just call me, or come to me.  I won't hurt you."

"event","Wow.  What a weekend.

I don't think I've ever had such great a horrible times all together in one 96 hour period.  So, there's good and bad news to report now.

I'll start with the bad.  The bad news is that not only did I disobey a direct order from my CO, I also managed to put a junior Marine's life in danger through neglegence.  The Marine is fine, other than the fact that he's in some serious trouble.  

     What does this mean to me?  It means that I am now guilty of the offense of derlilction of duty.  I have no clue how harshley my CO intends to punish me for my negligence.  It could be anything from restriction, fines, and extra punitive duty, to loss of rank.  Even worse, perhaps, loss of my billet as Ceremonial Bugler.  In these last few days, I feel as though my head is spinning.  Sometimes, I feel myself losing conciousness of my surroundings.  It's the unceartainty of all this that really makes it so difficult. I guess I just have to wait it out and see what happens.  Whatever does, I take responsibility for my mistakes, and hope to move on and come back even stronger than before.  That's how I have to look at it to stay sane.  That and trying not to think about it.

In all this confusion, though, I feel as though I've found some safestay.  Her name is Mellisa Haglund.  I spent Easter with her.  When I called the other Marine involved, she sensed my uneasyness about the whole thing, and made a concious effort to make me feel better.  And it worked.  Every moment I spend with her puts me at ease.  I told her, she's like a drug to me.  The more time I spend with her, the less I feel I can bear without her.  
     I had a rough day yesterday dealing with all of the things involved with my mistake.  So, I go to evening rehearsal and come back, turn into my room, and the first thing I see is her beautiful face, smiling at me.  It was like hearing the best news you could possibly ever hear.  So good that it was hard to believe at first.  That she was there for me when I needed her the most. 

Being with her puts things into perspective.  It's like understanding what things are fungable, and what are not.  Through all this I won't lose anything infungable.  In the long run, that's all that matters.  Anything else just makes me stronger.

So, what dreams, or nightmares, may come I have still to discover.  Believe me, when I find out what those are, you'll be one of the first to know.  Until then, ""Corporal Hess, out."""

"event","Allright.  So, I guess when you open a new journal, you're supposed to name it, and introduce yourself to it.  I guess I figure that the best way to get to know someone is just to be around them, though.  So, I'll skip my life story, and let you figure out who I am as we go.

Forgive me, first off.  I find it odd posting up information about my personal life on the internet for people to read.  Most journals are private.  I still haven't even decided if I intend to treat this as if it were a real journal or not.  I guess I'll have to try it on for size.

So, I was talking to Jake, my roomate about this new girl I'm with, Melissa.  In the last few weeks, this girl has kinda made my head spin.  In the begenning of our relationship, things happened that made it really hard for me to trust her.  She knows this.  Now, she's made the choice to be with me exclusively, which I'm glad.  I guess I just can't see myself being romantically involved with someone that I'm not really with exclusively.  It would be like having a child, but not being a father to it.  If a father really cared about his child, he wouldn't be a father part time.  It's either he's there for the child or he's not.  
     So, I read her journal entry today.  It talks about how she's looking forward to seeing me and dreaming about me, and that's great.  But then it also talks about the cute boys that she met at the club last night and how something might have happened with them, had she no boyfriend...
     I read it at first and thought, ""well... she's honest...""  But then after talking to Jake about it, I realize that if she's trying to build trust in the fact that I am what she wants, that's not exactly the kind of thing I need to be hearing about.  I can't blame her for being attracted to them.  She's entitled to that, and I don't expect her to censor her feelings and emotions.  What bothers me is that it seems she has no concept of how it might make me feel to hear that she was with these other guys that were hot and how if she didn't have a boyfriend ""shit would have happened.""
     So I don't understand if things like this happen because she's unaware of the fact that there's something wrong with it... or if she doesn't really respect me, or like me that way...  It's all confusing.  
    
     In the end of the journal entry, she wrote about how she didn't really want to get with these guys, and that it only made her want to be with me more, which made me feel much better about the whole thing.  She said a lot of things that made me feel secure about us.  I guess I just wished she understood that I am trying to be as secure as I can about us and things like that aren't helping.  I was completely secure about everything until I read her journal.  
     Maybe this online journal thing isn't such a good idea...
     All I know is that I really care about her and whenever I'm with her, things are great.  Things like this are the only thing wrong with our relationship, in my eyes.  
     I know that she's gonna be reading this, so I hope she understands that I'm not trying to be insecure, because I've been in the shoes of a person with an insecure person, and I hated it.. but I think that someone who really cares about me needs to have a little more respect for my feelings.  I care about her a lot more than I have about anything recently.  She means something to me, obviously.
     So, I get to see her tommorow.  We're spending Easter together, and honestly, I couldn't imagine a better way to spend it than with her.  So, maybe I'll tell you about that in a few days.. If I decide I want to keep exposing myself like this..."

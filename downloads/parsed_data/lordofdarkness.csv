"event","I am so upset, I think I could cry for a week. I just finished watching the bonus features for Firefly and it's finaly hit home that it's over. I've been obsessed for the past week or so, watching episodes, every time I had a few minutes to myself, in my breaks at work, on the toilet, walking to the bike shed on my way home, finishing the last ten minutes of an episode in bed. I can't get enough of it. I've seen the film twice in the last couple of weeks (I know it's not a lot, but I don't have the kind of free time that I used to) and I think I'm going to have to watch the entire series over again starting tomorrow.

I feel like such a sad bastard, but I really loved this show. I shall probably go to bed every night for the rest of my life praying that when I wake up in the morning there will be an announcement that they're making a second series.

Now I should off to bed before my sleep deprivation makes me post more weird things."

"event","So, Erika's back in the States for a week. I am quite quite lonely, and a little lost as to what to do with myself. I've never spent more than an hour(in total) alone in this house, it's a little strange.

She left yesterday, from Heathrow, in the midst of all this terrorist malarkey. She's still not home and thus I've still not received word from her. Her Mother was kind enough to let me know she had to stop over in Boston for the night and that she's tired but alright.

<lj-cut text=""The infamous flight of doom"">
So yeah, the airport, that was fun.
Supposed to fly out on Wednesday, but alas we got there a little late and they wouldn't let her on. The plane wasn't scheduled to leave for 45minutes, but apparently that's too late to check in. So we had to purchase a standby ticket and wait for the next plane that was going that way, to finish checking in and see if there was a free seat for her. $100 and 4hours later we found out there wasn't, and that we'd have to do the same thing all over again tomorrow. We didn't much fancy sitting around an airport all day, wating for someone else to miss their flight, so that we could have their seat. So we opted to pay an additional $151 to upgrade the standby ticket to an actual ticket, that would garantee her a seat on the 4pm plane.

We got back home just in time for me to leave to work, but knowing I had to do it all again the next day, I had to ring in and tell them I wasn't showing up. My boss was suprisingly understanding and gave me the day off as Holiday, so I didn't lose out on too much money this week (does mean one day less I'll be paid later on in the year though).

So then we're getting ready to leave the next morning when Erika flicks on the TV, to see a picture of a plane on the news. ""uh oh, this can't be good"". Not really what you want to hear just before you leave to get on a plane. It did however give us a chance to re-pack, knowing she wasn't going to be able to take any hand luggage on the plane with her.

Once we got there it wasn't so bad. There were loads of people queueing up outside waiting for their flight numbers to be called, but otherwise it was pretty much business as usual. All incomming flights had been cancelled and so had all flights to Europe, but other than long delays and the security team being on Red Alert (there were Police with machineguns everywhere and everyone getting on a plane was thoroughly searched and had their shoes x-rayed) flights to the US were going ahead as planned. The no hand luggage policy was a little extreem though. Everyone was given a clear plastic bag and the only things Erika was allowed to bring on with her was her Sunglasses, her Passport/plane tickets/wallet-thing and her athsma inhaler. No headache tablets, no books, no water/orange juice, no headphones. I understand most of the items, like anything electronic, or fluid in nature, but a book? What exactly can you conceal in a book that won't come up on an x-ray? They had to wait 6 hours for thier plane to take off, that kind of waiting time without music, a book, or a close friend can drive a person crazy! I know, I get paid a reasonable sum of money to endure 12hours of it a night. :p

*sigh* But all this kerfuffle is worthwhile if it means she's not blown out of the sky by some religious nutjob.

It'll be good to know when she's home safe and sound. I'm so glad I got an email from her mum shortly after I got in from work. I don't think I could have stayed up much longer waiting for word, but then I woundn't have been able to sleep either. Apparently she had to wait around for 6 hours for the plane to take off, then they ran out of time and had to stop in Boston, where they gave her a hotel room and plane tickets to Chicago on some afternoon flight. I expected her to be home an hour ago, but I'm sure I'll get word soon.

Hmm I seem to have written more than I expected perhapse an LJ-cut will prevent the scaring off of my imaginary readers.
</lj-cut>

Ugh, so, after spending 4 hours on a train and 4 hours at heathrow airport, I then had to cycle to work for a nice 12hour shift. I was pretty knackered when I got home, and have thus spent all day sleeping. My sleep pattern for the weekend is now going to be pretty screwed up. :/

So I'm free this weekend and I'm likely to be quite bored and lonely. If anyone has any plans or wants to meet up and do something let me hear your suggestions. I may just lose myself in computergames. Today could be a good time to install Oblivion."

It doesn't help that some of the lines are down and almost everyone from my usual team is either off tonight or working elsewhere, so I have to work with people from the other lines. Most of whom I don't mind but two of which are just irritating the fuck out of me.
Maybe I'm just pissed off because the Iroquai decided to wipe me off the face of the planet before I came to work. *must play more Civ III* :p

None of the lines are running. So we're all sat around doing nothing. I drew a chess board on a piece of card and cut some pieces out of red and white paper, but half way into a game with one of the new starters, Brian (who's been a temp here for over 2 years) came over and gave his speech on how if we're caught playing games we'll be sacked and that we have to just stand around and do nothing. Then he started a game of Eye-Spy. Now no-one will play with me. Topics of cenversation include football (bleh) and Adrian complaining about the HR Depatment because he's bitter that he didn't get a permanent job.

I've only got enough training left to keep me busy for maybe an hour or two. I'm tempted to take a half day, but I need the money. :/

It has been 11 or so years since I had regular contact with her. She was one of my favourite teachers over the years, called herself The Sarky Devil. (I have no idea how you would spell that, it doesn't seem to be a real word, needless to say she liked her sarcasm).

She was saying she saw me in Ware a while back when I had long hair, and thought, ""oooh, that was Andrew"" where as someone else approached her in Tescos recently and said Hi, and she had no idea who they were. It's nice to know not only did she leave a lasting impression on me, but I must have left enough of one on her too that she still recognises me a decade later, with stupid hair and 2 stone of extra weight.

"event","I'm so unbelievably bored. I've been passing the time by making a Sanity Harness, Crown of Protection, and Beard of Wisdom.
I started with the Sanity Harness. A belt of sorts that I made out of cable ties, that wrapped around my waist about 8 times. And when people asked me why, I told them it was to hold my sanity in. And that it was commonly believed that sanity leaks out of the ears or nose, but in actuality it leaks from the belly button.
Richard however, after giggling to some of the other staff about me came up to me and said that it could prove a potential UIR (Unusual Incident Report) and that hypethetically if I was to reach into a machine to fix a fault one of the ties could fall off and get stuck in the machine and damage one of the stations. So I took it off.

But the boredom of monotony drove me to construct a crown, that really happened by accident. I was just messing with the cable ties, trying to find a less slap dash and more secure way of making a Sanity Harness when I found myself holding the Crown of Protection. It was on my head for no longer than 2 minutes before Adrian walking past said that if anyone important catches me wearing that...*trails off into the distance*

The Beard of Wisdom was pretty boring, and irritating, so I only wore that for a few minutes before discarding it. We have to take the sticky labels off the bags of components and discard them in a special blue bin bag for disposal (because they have batch numbers and barcodes and stuff on them that glaxo wants incinerated, or something) and I just stuck a load to my chin and started stroking them like the guy from Kill Bill 2.

I'm running out of ways to amuse myself, might try doodling on my lab coat.

I've decided I'm rather insane.

I remembered half an hour ago that I forgot to take any hot cross buns to work with me. This makes me sad. =[

I don't want to be here anymore. I'm thinking if the need arises I'll get fired by sitting bollock naked in one of the component hoppers, it's original and I'll be remembered."

My trainer's not here either. Which not only means I wont be able to learn anything new, but it also means my main source of amusement here is missing. He's the only one here I really have anything in common with, and he's a complete nutcase.

We were standing around before starting the line up discussing the day's plans and stuff, the line leader asked my trainer if he was going to train Adrian on the coiler today, and me on the test machine and he said sure, I'll do Adrian first and Andrew after break. Then Phil (the line leader) said ""if he can stay awake today"" (I'm never going to live that down) and Neil (my trainer) was like ""oh he'll just stand there while I teach him everything, it'll be a piece of piss to him, mentally, but physically it'll be impossible.

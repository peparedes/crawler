"event","Yesterday was a pretty awesome day.. A little sleepy cause I sacrificed sleep to go see Erin. But it's worth it. Went over to her house around 12:15 this afternoon. Brought her lunch so she wouldn't have to make anything. I know she loves her Taco's =p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we sat and ate and watched Wife Swap (not really what i would like to be watching. But not my choice I guess). After we finished eating, she and I took a shower together and talked and laughed some. Then we got out and got ready for Aiden's first speech therapy appointment. Went pretty well for the most part. He had kind of a rough day so... he was mildly cranky anyways. 

But today was great. I enjoyed my shower with Erin. Just a shower. Nothing more. And we had a little bit of snuggle time on the couch before and after until we had to leave. I hope for more days like today. It was good.

Peace, love, and happiness.. I'm out for the night."

"event","Well.. Had a long conversation with Erin last night. 2hrs to be exact. Lots of stuff was discussed. Which makes me feel good cause we've never been able to do that before. But basically after all of it, she wants me to show her i appreciate her more and acknowledge stuff more. Tell her good things. THEN she will give me more affection and show ME&nbsp;that she loves me. She feels broken. Well i'm broken too. But that hasn't stopped me from pampering her. And doing everything for her for the last 2 months. I screwed up the last couple of weeks. And I'm going to work on that. But I guess nothing i've done thus far was good enough to get her to give anything back to me. Taking her out to eat. Bringing her food all the time. Going to the movies. Going to hobby lobby with her. All the random text messages I sent her. The I love you's. I'm so lost. I slacked off on it and stopped cause I don't feel like i'm getting anywhere. Or acknowledgment back. Why do I have to do everything first. We are both broken. I've spent the last 2 months trying to be there for her. If I have to do everything first, What am I supposed to acknowledge? Why is she always too busy to do anything for me. Or the things&nbsp;I wanted? Yesterday was good. I'm hoping for more of those. And multiplied 20x over

But none the less. After our conversation last night. I'm going to send her random messages. Acknowledge when she does things that make me happy. Tell her that I'm happy we are together. And have faith and hope and wait.

Off to work. Peace out. And have fun.

PS. Turning this journal upside down. Hopefully it will shine and smile. And maybe make my relationship better. Faith....."

But she didn't disagree with my request. I don't know if that's just cause she wasn't in the mood or if she actually feels that what I said was a good thing. But I really hope she goes through with it. It would really help both. And I'm going to work on my part as well. I am going to be less cranky. She is going to talk to me more. Or send me random messages. Just something comforting if nothing else. Just something like saying that she's happy about us. Or that she loves. Or she can't wait to see me next. Whatever.

She gets up at odd times and stuff and pretty much takes care of the necessities to pee and maybe snack on some soup and stuff. It was good to get to talk to her. She says she's getting a little better so that's good news. But anyways.. I'm out. Hopefully I can make it through work tonight. Last time I stood up to walk across the house I almost blacked out again and then I threw up. No fun to clean up when you don't feel good. Nite"

The movie is over. I know why it bothers me so much. And I wish she could understand. I trust her not to make the same mistake. But I can't help but wonder. With all the complaining I do. Trying to get things where we can both be comfortable. But it does worry me. She found something good enough in him over me once. It's just jealousy an insecurities. And I do need to mellow. I really want this to work. But she makes me feel like we are soooooo far apart all the time. And I can't handle it. A relationship is about 2 people being together for each other and supporting each other primarily. And I have to fight her just to get her attention.  *deep breath* I'm getting all wound up again. 1:24am. *sigh* so glad anything I say means anything. She'll brush all my feelings off as over reacting and will then just ignore this.   =(</p><p>Well back to work to get caught up.

"event","<p>So. Apparently I need to just calm down. Forget about myself and anything I need. But according to her she's not asking me to make any sacrifices or to change anything. To me what she is doing requires me to make a big sacrifice on my part. Which I was aware of ok with and will deal with. But you sure don't see me out galavanting with someone I cheated on her with let alone just someone of the opposite sex. Going on dates or hanging out afterhours alone with them. She would have my head. So I hope she really considers what I'm doing for her to make this work. This as well as other stuff. Compromising is still sacrificing. I do it to make her happy. But she is stuck in only what she wants. How do I fix that. I can't do it without her. And I'm trying to make this happen for us. So here goes. *deep breath* *slap face* *shake head* and *deep breath* again.. Whew.

What does she miss? All I do is gripe and complain about things. Apparently for no reason it feels like. Try to talk about it and it just ends up being because I'm doing something wrong. Never because what she may be doing. I want this to work. But she has to work with me. She said she would if I came back. 

And after the week. The next obstacle, Will be that she will be back in school. Which of course means she will no longer have time for me. Again. Which gives me the 1 day with her. Tuesday. *sigh*"

"event","Well good fucking morning to you too. So after our long conversation last night. She doesn't talk to me for like 3 hours. When that entire conversation was about how little attention she pays to me. Fancy that. No text message or anything this morning to say good morning when she got up. Nothing. I got up this morning. Turned on my computer. And took Mica outside and walked down to get the mail and drop off my netflix movies. I finally get a phone call 5 minutes before she has to leave and she's yelling at me. Cause she can't get her printer to work so she can't print directions. I tried to help but she just kept yelling at me with everything i suggested. Why she didn't take care of this last night, who knows. She said she tried. I don't think she did. Knowing that she was playing Sims and probably talking to Josh about picking him up today I could be wrong. But if she was having problems with it she didn't ask me last night. That's for sure. So ya.. gonna be a wonderful lousy ass day. I feel worthless. Good day. Probably won't post again til tonight. Maybe it will be happier then. I will have Aiden. I'm excited. My goofy kid."

Was a little off yesterday evening so i didn't feel like posting. Aiden's appointment went really well apparently. Which was good. He Finished his test and we will find out the results on Wednesday hopefully. I have an appointment with his psychiatrist today to answer a few questions about Aiden's behaviors when he's over at my house. Which should go pretty well. I don't typically have many issues when he's at my house with me. He does his thing and has fun. He gets in trouble from time to time as any 4 yr old would. But otherwise is a good kid. 

Had another express my feelings conversation last night. Ya. You can imagine how that went. Basically. I have to lay down everything. Get nothing. Give her everything until she's happy again/or comfortable. Then I can have something in return.  She's says that's not what she said but basically, really, it is. I did tell her though that I would be not cranky about stuff and when she does show affection i would show it back. She says she needs support and not nagging. Wouldn't me telling her what I and need and talking to her about what she needs be support? Unless by support... again... she means walking blindly, keeping my mouth shut, and just doing what she wants. She has this misconstrued idea that i've wronged her so much worse. Which is partially true. Tho mine is gone. Her's is not. And me having to deal with that. Ya. The effects and emotional hurt that causes me doesn't seem to bother her at all either. But I&nbsp;guess we'll see how it goes. I'm trusting that she took in something i said last night and that things will start to improve. Not trying to trust. Doing it. 

Anyways.. enough of that. I'll post to you later. Night night."

Unless I do it myself. Which I don't want to... *sigh* It's rather frustrating. The hurt and lack of sleep have made me cranky. I still wonder how this is all gonna work out. I'm just more touchy feely romantic spend as much time as possible together type person. A hopeless sappy romantic basically. I'm more of an it's all about you type person.

If I'm anywhere near the top, then it sure isn't shown very well.

Anyways... So we went and watched the new Sherlock Holmes movie. It was good. I liked it. Boy was a little wormy and didn't want to sit down. Had a good day lounging with Aiden and Erin. We played some games with Aiden. I got Sims 3 re-installed and so far my computer seems to be behaving thus far. Hopefully it stays that way. Well... probably gonna stay up for a couple hours and then off to bed.. been a long day."

Torn between so many themes. Surprisingly I found a lot of themes I liked. Some dark and some light. Found more that were neutral than anything. And a couple of darker one's that were really cool.

"event","Well, here it goes again. Up and down and mixed emotions. I took this opportunity with open arms and full awareness of what's to come. But I am hoping for the best anyways. It doesn't look all that promising right now. And only seems to be getting worse. Not much really seems to have changed. And it seems anytime I bring up problems/or how I feel about something, there's always something wrong with her and she doesn't want to talk about it or she just blows it off entirely. She then off course just says that I don't notice the things she does. I can see efforts being made on some things. But that's a different post for another day. Her statement of I should just take her how she is, which basically forces me to be the one that has to change and never her, doesn't really help the situation any. I tried talking to her about things a couple nights ago. She of course didn't want to talk when I wanted to. When something was weighing on me. When I needed her. She always has an excuse. It's always something. So what am i suppose to do.. hell if I know. 

Only other thing going on right now is this week. But i'm not even going to get into how this week is gonna go. I'm hoping it doesn't go too bad. Again I have in my mind about how it's gonna go but i'm not saying it here. I'm giving it a chance to be OK. Yet another thing that I am sacrificing and willing to accept. And she doesn't' even seem to care what it does to me. But wish me luck. *crosses fingers*

Friend wise everything is great. We are back to normal anyways. Talking, laughing, hanging out with Aiden etc. We've went to see a few movies. Had Christmas with her and Aiden at her parents house yesterday. It was fun. Got to watch my spoiled kid open all his presents. Of course then shortly after they get handed to me.. So i can open the iron-bound toy and put batteries in it. LoL."

But its not my life or my choice. I have my own problems/tasks to deal with. Which are going well at the moment.<br/><br/>I also made a splurge for myself. I went ahead and bought Guitar Hero 3 to play.

Ema and I have been spending a lot of time together over the past month. Talking and discussing things and trying to figure out how to work things out. We are probably going to be getting back together. so I'm very excited. We've hit a couple of snags but talked them over and its ok.<br/><br/>So our next step is moving back in together. I'm very excited. I'm ready to be together again. I still have some concerns but I am hoping we can resolve them together.<br/><br/>I'm going to say this even though it will go against my counceling. But I think it needs to be said to get it off my chest..<br/><br/>-Problems---<br/>-she still makes this whole seperation sound like it is my fault. I will not deny that, yes I'm the one that drew the line and 'kicked her out'. but she has contributed to the position we are in as well.<br/><br/>-still has responsibility issues. such as keeping things clean and picking up after herself. doesn't see this as a problem. all I can do is hope it gets better because nothing I say is going to change it. I can't.. only she can..<br/><br/>-she is jobless again. whether this one was her fault or not I don't know. but she doesn't feel that this time was or any others.<br/><br/>-Improvements---<br/>-Adult time has been good. even though we don't do 'anything'. watching movies or goofing with games on yhe consoles.<br/><br/>-being acknowledged when we are at her family's house.<br/><br/>-won't know how well shes doing on consideering what I want, or how often we play, or some other random things until we actually move in together. though we have had a couple snags where she has kind of blown off what I want or what I had to say... but I ignored it.. so we will see I guess. (GH3, riding lawn mower, her comment on my credit card bills)<br/><br/>Well that is mostly what I wanted to say.

Spent time together, Got close, snuggled, loved, watched tv, movies, laughed, giggled, and had a good time. That didn't involve sex, arguing, or seperation. It was a great week.

I finally was able to buy the phone I have been wanting so I can have my PDA and my phone in one device. So maybe I can get my life back together again. It's gonna be nice... can't wait for it to get here.

For some reason, still listening to 70s,80s music??? not sure whutsup with that. Probably from listening to it so much with my Dad.&nbsp; Currently listening to Def Leopard and Bon Jovi. Probably my 2 top favorites, followed by Journey.

Things are looking up. I feel much better since i've been posting in my journal. It has some good stuff and some bad stuff. Hopefully good stuff will continue to overrule the bad. I was going to go skating last night but ended up just staying home. I'm tired but I can't quit thinking about Ema. It's one of those where you really tired but don't feel it or can't sleep. Things seem to be getting so much better over the past couple of weeks. I talked to my counselor on Thursday and that helped a lot. I got some ideas and things to better my life and those around me. So, goodbye bad attitude and bottled up anger, and hello to happiness and joy inside out. I am so anxious now. I know things can only get better from here. Stay on the positive side.

Apparently we are going to attempt for me to come spend the night with Ema a couple of nights this week. I just hope either she pushes things a step forward OR that I don't screw up. I'm going to enjoy being able to lay next to her again. It's going to be beautiful. I can't wait. I will hopefully have an added surprise but I don't know yet due to financials.

My funny for the day. My son decided to be a goof a put the blanket over his head and walk around the living room. The first thing that happened was he bumped into the China cabinet. Didn't even hesitate, backed up, and started walking again. Then runs into a wall. Deciding that I should probably make him take the blanket off his head before I laughed to death, I got up and took the blanket off of him and picket him up to look at his head and make sure he was ok. He just kind of looked at me and giggled and so I put him back down and took the blanket back to the couch. I found him later running around the house with it on his head again. But this time, he would take a few steps, stop, lift the blanket up a little bit then walk some and put it back down before continuing. LOL.. he is his mothers son, that is for sure.

Well that's really all I have to post tonight. Overall things are on the up and up. I hope they stay that way."

""Pushing a partner to change is about as effective as trying to make friends with a squirrel by chasing it"" 

- Harriet Lerner, The Dance of Intimacy, p. 7
--------------------

The second thing will be just my short blurb for the night. I got up late this afternoon so once again, didn't do much. Got to spend some time with Ema before she went to work, Played with Aiden until I took him to his Nana for the night, and then went to work. After work I went and visited with Ema for about 30 mins while she was working and helped pass the rest of the night for her then when she got off I disappeared and met her at her car with flowers. :)&nbsp; I love her so much.&nbsp; After getting home I did the usual. Balanced my checkbook played games for a few since tonight was my short night and I wasn't tired yet. Decided to go to bed after talking to Ema for a little bit. Laid in bed and watched Nightmare before Christmas and now i'm updating real quick and heading to sleep. Took some tylenol PM&nbsp; :).&nbsp; Stupid season changes. Messes me all up. Can't breath, sore throat, it sucks.

BUT THE BIGGEST UPDATE FOR THE NIGHT IS THAT EMA KISSED ME. Was only on the cheek and very short, and covered up by immediately kissing Aiden afterwards... but none the less. Because I asked her tonight before she went to bed if the kiss was intentional. She said yes. So I am in cloud 9 all over again. I'm excited. And I miss her and love her.

Anyways... Nighty Night

So I guess it wasn't as short as I thought it was going to be.&nbsp; ~~TTFN"

I don't know what to do. I'm waiting for her to decide whether or not it's worth us getting back together to her and it's killing me during that time. Once the decision is made i'll be able to get over whichever the result is. If we get back together then i'll be the happiest man alive. If not then I can at least move on with life. Instead, i'm waiting each day just hoping that she is going to say yes. Kind of like the anxiety you get when your about to ask the woman of your dreams to marry you. Right now, I'm hoping that she is going to decide/see and say yes after I talk to my counselor on Thursday. But when Thursday comes around and she doesn't, it will just put me back in the same spot again. And i'll just keep trying to do what I can. I received a text message from her late last night though because she had one of those concerned ""mommy feelings"". So I called to make sure she was alright and a little while later she sent me this exact text message: ""It means a lot to me that you called to check on me. Talking to you does make me feel better."" So that what a good feeling. I just hope we can get back together and I can continue to do that for her for the rest of our lives.

--------------------

Came to work and the first thing that happened. I was on one call for 3.5hrs due to an email server going down. Had to get a bunch of people on the phone and troubleshoot. And our phone queue was packed. Missed break. Just now got to go at 10:30pm and we usually start breaks at 9:00pm. That's all for now... heading back.

----------------------

Well... all I gotta say is i'm glad that night is over. We were down 2 people plus the odd call volume. Not sure what made last night so special, but it was busy. Oh well... I have a couple of other things I want to post but will probably do that a little later today... I'm going to bed right now.

I played with Aiden for a little bit today. Took him to stay with my mom until Ema gets off work because Ema's mom is out of town and not able to watch him. 

Ema came to have lunch at my house (only for like 15 mins but still). I didn't say a whole lot. Since I was up for a while this morning calling the counselor and stuff, I didn't get hardly any sleep before Aiden came over. Hopefully tomorrow I can make up for it a little since Ema doesn't have to work. I love my son. He's a goober. Wish Ema would wake him up earlier so I can put him down for naps when he gets to my house at around 1:30pm. Then I could get a few more hours of sleep.

This journal thing is really helping. I like being able to post in it every day. It works out much nicers.

Well... First break is over... so i'm out for now.

Well Lunch was spent going and getting lunch for everyone at work. 4 seperate orders, at McDonald's, ya you can imagine how well that went. Night crew at McDee's, Not the brightest crayons in the box.

Well I didn't get to go pee or take my break until about 4:15am so I didn't get to call Ema. So i'm sure she won't be happy with me today. I wasn't feeling real talkative today so, probably not a bad thing all together anyways. Guess we'll see how it plays out. Anyways... I'm off to bed for this morning.

"event","Slight change of plan. I setup my account and scheduled to speak with a counselor on Thursday Nov 8 @ 17:00. Guess there wasn't anyone available to talk now and they were all on the phone. So I just scheduled an appointment. Wish me luck. Hopefully Ema won't be upset about having to wait. Granted that's all i've done is wait so... couldn't hurt that much to wait a little more.

Well guess i'm gonna check my email, LJ, and Myspace real quick then i'm headed to bed.

"event","Well I figured out one way I can do my journal updates.&nbsp; Since I carry my laptop with me everywhere anyways. I have this nifty little addon to firefox that allows me to post to livejournal without actually having to login and go to livejournal.com website. So I can type in what I want to post about my day while i'm on breaks and lunch at work, then all I have to do when I get home is add any last details I missed or vents about work, and hit ""Post"". This way I get my post in more often.

Well, Ema isn't going to be happy with me. I didn't call the counselor yesterday like I said/was going to. I got most of my other stuff done. I got some good rest, took a shower, then bathed Mica, so Mica is clean, brushed, nails clipped, and my room is clean. Got my checkbook half balanced. Didn't get to finish that. Had to leave for work. Didn't get to play my game I have to return tomorrow though :(&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well. Games aren't important right now. Shoot, I haven't touched my games or computer in almost 2 weeks or so until yesterday. I stayed the night at my brothers house while mom was out of town, and played my Wii with my brother and sister all night and most of the next day. We rented a multiplayer game we could play that I have to take back sometime Monday.

So I guess other than that. Not much going on. The rest of the night I was working, training and talking about geek stuff.

------------------------------

2nd update for the night. I called Ema on lunch and it didn't go well. I'm happy to find out that she isn't getting any further away from us being together, but we aren't getting any closer either. We are still in the same as we were is what she said. I am going to talk to my counselor this morning. I think i'll be awake enough to do so. 

Apparently because we have seperate checking accounts her money and what she spends is no longer any of my business. To me, as long as I have a valid marriage license with both our names on it, everything is my business as it is her's for me. So she re-worded it to, I don't have any control over what she spends her money on. Well... that's a problem to. The objective behind seperate checking accounts was not to make it so we can blow money without each other knowing or being able to say anything about it. It was done to help the responsibility of both of us, also to allow us to save up money for things we want, yes, but, that should not exclude the respect of talking about it BEFORE buying it.

Well... My night is over and i'm back at home. Time to call the counselor and head to bed. Wish me luck. I will probably post the conversation. But as mentioned before, will probably be a private post.

"event","Well... Now i'm lost on something. I'm being told now that a journal can be just for venting or whatever. She used to get onto me all the time... ""How come you don't ever post anything happy"". Well now i'm trying to make my journal both and i just don't seem to have enough time to keep up with it both ways. I like venting in it simply due to that and music are how I tend to keep my attitude, temper, mood, etc in check. I let it out through music mostly. But in the famous words of a favorite movie, Fuck it, i'm just going with it.

So anyways... The past couple of weeks have been up and down. Work is supposed to be slowing down now because in the home office and warehouses they are not allowed to install or change any system altering software or hardware unless it breaks, *thinks quietly* on its own. So my job will slow down to almost 1/4 of our call volume divided amongst 4 techs. Will be interesting.

Home life: Halloween past. Aiden was a Pirate and was cute. I feel like an ass because I screwed up my budgeting because I wasn't paying attention to my checking account and caused myself to not be able to take Aiden tricking treating or to dress up with him. I found a matching adult pirate costume I wanted so bad. I was mad at myself so much for that. Otherwise things are as they usually are per the norm. I'm still alone and miserable. Although, something wonderful happened a couple of nights ago. Since about a couple of weeks after we got seperated, last night was the first huge sign that I have a chance. Ema sent me a text specifically saying that she wants me back, but she's scared. WOOT.&nbsp; Now I just have to figure out what to do about the scared.&nbsp; I want her and us to be together again so bad.&nbsp; So here's what she told me last night. She wants me to go see a counselor. She says that if I don't there's no chance that we will get back together. But if I do then it will look good to her and be a right step. So I am going to call my counseling service tomorrow and talk to them. Not sure if I will post that info or not. I might and hide it just to have. But other than that I'm just working, sleeping, and playing with my kiddo.

For now... guess i'm gonna try and get some sleep now that i've posted. I want to get in the habit of posting every night/morning before i go to sleep. Hopefully not as long as this one. :)&nbsp;&nbsp; i'll put you guys in your death bed."

"event","<p>1) I got my laptop back today after it spent a month and a half in the hospital getting a hard disc transplant, so that's what I did today.<br /><br />2) I'm just not as patient as I used to be, and I don't know why. I can't put any care and effort into my Spanish homework because I just can't be bothered. Five extra minutes would earn me so many extra points and I just can't do it. Such are the trials and tribulations of Mike.<br /><br />3) According to my FSU online profile, my projected graduation date is Spring 2010. That's how much I suck. Hopefully we can cut that down by a few semesters by buckling down come Fall. I mean, I'm already expecting to graduate at least a semester late due to that disastrous freshman year, but two whole years? C'mon. I'm not that bad a student. I'm doing really well now. I'm technically a creative writing major, but I actually have more classes under my belt for a literature major, so maybe I'll switch majors and graduate early... then move to Los Angeles and be poor and &lt;&lt;insert incredible stroke of luck&gt;&gt; and be rich and famous.<br /><br />4) Grindhouse is good. Go see it, not The Reaping or Firehouse Dog, unless you're an idiot.<br /><br />I don't feel like numbering anymore) I turn 21 on Thursday. I won't be doing anything on Thursday for a&nbsp;couple of reasons. First, new Office. Second, I have class on Friday and I don't want to be any more irresponsible than I already am. I might do something on Friday, but I still probably won't. I'm not in a terribly social mood lately. It's just those end-of-semester blues gettin' me down. One minute I'm high on life and love college, the next I just want to be done with this and focus on the after-stuff.</p><p>I still don't feel like numbering) I just stared at my screen without typing a single word for about ten minutes. I'm going to bed.</p>"

"event","Bleh. I'm bored.

I'm killing time in the library because my first class was canceled, but&nbsp; I don't have enough time to go home before my second class. Then I have to go to some speech and debate meet for a research credit. Then (after missing Idol and House because of the speech and debate thing) I'll be up all night doing Spanish homework and writing an essay on British Romantic poets.

On Friday I got to see Bruce Campbell, and then I went home for an impromptu weekend with the family, Dogs 'R' Us and gang. I didn't really need to go home, buts its always nice to sleep in my old bed... and play Wii."

It's like Stella if off the wall humor didn't come naturally to it and it ended up trying to hard.

This begs the question: if Sarah Silverman is really nothing but a less funny Stella, then why didn't Comedy Central just keep Stella on the air rather than cancel it and replace it with a watered down retread?"

"event","The reason David Cross and Portia di Rossi are my icon is that they make me giggle every time I look at them. It's much funnier when you are the obsessive Arrested Development fan that I am.

The most interesting thing that has happnened to me lately is that I found a brand-new umbrella on a bus and have decided to use us in spite of the fact that there has not been a rain cloud in sky for days. It's driving Chris crazy, but since I am not particulary superstiticious I continue to use it indoors and on my brief walks to the computer lab.

Speaking of the computer lab, here I am all night again, this time writing a paper for my lit course. I have until 5 in the afternoon to finish it, but the real problem is that I have barely started it yet. It is a very shaky paper, but luckily for me teachers have a hard time distinguishing my shaky papers from my labored ones.

Even though I have cooled down since my last entry, I still think I'm wasting my life right now. I just don't feel any real passion for anything in my life right now. I've never been this complacent. Maybe things will change after Christmas, but that's more optimistic than I care to be right now. I'd rather be realistic and come to terms with the fact that I just don't know where I'm going anymore. As recent as last semester I was so sure of everything, but, alas, things change. Woe is me.

Seriously, though, I'm not as terminally depressed as I was last week, but I'm still not exactly pleased with myself. When I'm not bored out of my mind (by *everything*), I'm disappointed with myself, as if I'm mad that I allow myself to be so bored with my life. These things pass, but I know it all means something and I'd like to learn something from this period of self-loathing-lite before I snap out of it and once again become the chipper Mike you all know and love."

"event","How is it that I can be so intensly motivated to do something that I literally jump out of my seat to accomplish it for about five minutes and then, suddenly, I don't care?

How is it that I can get the urge to throw all my shit in a bag and hop a bus to a town that I've never heard of to be surrounded by people that I've never met and really, really want to do it, but then do a 180 and just want to go to Titusville and stay in parents' house forever and never have to grow up?

All I want to do is write! That's it! I have all these great ideas in my head, in notebooks, on that stupid tape recorder I bought and everytime I try to sit down and make something out of any of them, I don't care. I just lose all motivation. I'm tired of writing half-assed ethnographic articles, I'm tired of writing term papers on Renaissance art and I'm tried of writing analytical essays on feminist literature. I just want to create something unique, I want to write a story. I want to write a screenplay and I have every mean to do it and I can't and it kills me every fucking time.

I have no motivation and I don't know why. I feel like I have no motivation to even be at this school anymore. I'm working towards a BA in English that will likely take me until 2015 to complete at the rate I'm going and for what? None of my life's goals (if I even have any. I'm not sure anymore) require a class in ""Poetic Technique"" so I'll be damned if I know why the hell I'm taking next year. Dropping out of school is just another thing that I feel is urgent and needs to be done for about ten minutes and then... I just drop dead. I lose motivation even to take steps towards being less motivated.

What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't want to be one of those people who just settles for an average life managing a supermarket. I want to do what I love for the rest of my life with people who will know and understand me, but if I can't be bothered to pursue something I love, what's going to happen to me? Why can't I just write something? Anything? Why can't I be bothered to care about school anymore? Is it because I know that deep down what I want is not at Florida State?

My own personal failures are something that drive me crazy every minute of every day. My failures in school, in love, in mere pursuit of goals and, of course, in trying to make my parents proud are all outstanding among the people I know and I can't think of a single reason why I allow them to befall me all the goddamn time. With someone as personally tormented by how he treats himself, you'd think I'd have plenty of material to write about and I really do. I just can't open Word or Final Draft to save my life."

I've got a paper on Christopher Marlowe due Thursday morning, an economics test on Thursday night and a paper on male characterization in feminist literature due next Monday.

And that's before Finals week even starts.

Yeesh.

I would love to go home and play some more Twilight Princess right now. That would be so boss. It is among the only things my brain has been able to focus on all day.

I'm really glad I brought the Dreamcast up again. It gives me something to do now that my laptop is gone for the week the one week I need it most. So much homework! Periodic Virtua Tennis/Capcom vs. SNK/Worms Armageddon breaks with Chris are just what I need to break the monotony. I really want to see The Fountain and For Your Consideration, but I just don't have the time."

1) not getting any wireless signal at all and
2) making crazy ""I'm about to explode in your face"" noises.

I don't have a single class all week, but I still have a Part I of a Final Paper assignment due by 5 and a journal entry for a different class due by 8 AM tomorrow, so I'm still bored.

Last night's ""Simpsons"" was exceptionally funny, as all Moe-centric episodes are, and it helped get rid of the unpleasant aftertaste of the disappointing trailer last week. I got an extremely literate reference concerning Jonathan Franzen on the show because I'm writing a paper on him for a class. ::Pats self on back::

I saw Casino Royale the other day, which is marginally awesomer than anything else ever. Daniel Craig is such a perfect Bond. Even if you're not a fan of the series, you owe it to yourself to give it another go-'round with Craig. He will make you a Bond believer. Mark my words.

I'm heading home for Thanksgiving on Wednesday, so I'll have a few days in Titusville to play Wii Sports, and then I need to remember to grab the Dreamcast so Chris and I can throw down the Virtua Tennis.

I really want to stop writing about feminist theory, but I should have known better when I selected ""Women in Literature"" as my Lit course.

So what will I do with a BA in English (assuming I even get that far)? Duh. Move out to Hollywood with Jon and work it out from there. What else is there for me to do with myself?"

"event","I bought the final season of Arrested Development on DVD last night.

I have so little TV to look forward to now.

I still have Simpsons. I'll always have the Simpsons.

I want to get into The Office and 24, two shows I never really cared enough about until very recently, but I'm not exactly passionate about yet. The Office is very funny, at least the few episodes I saw, and I suppose it can help fill the void in me that was left when FOX replaced Arrested Development with Skating With Celebrities (which actually got better ratings... ::sigh::)

I am seriously digging House, and it's a shame that my class will always conflict with it. Thank God for Mom's VCR skills.

Malcolm's gone. King of the Hill is still in that Sunday night death slot. There's only like 4 new South Parks a year. I'm a year behind on Smallville still. I can't watch the new season until I watch the DVDs of last season.

There's always late night. Letterman, Conan, Daily Show, Colbert (which has grown on me considerably). They won't go anywhere.

But I'll always have the Simpsons at the very least.

I just can't believe I live in a world where Seth McFarlane has two horribly animated, poorly written, unfunny cartoons on at the same time and Emmy-winning Arrested Development just never found a decently sized audience. Too smart for its own good."

Feel sorry for me.

Do it!

Nah, don't bother.

I really don't care what the box office numbers say, Superman Returns was way better than Dead Man's Chest. Why is it that this summer all the sequels that exceeded expectations (Superman, Mission Impossible) got crushed by the mediocre/diappointing ones (Pirates, X-Men 3)? It's typical.

I'm absolutely crused that Universal is closing the Back to the Future ride. I really can't fathom why on earth they're opting to replace rather than just tweak it. If the rumors are true and they really are paving way for a Simpsons ride, then it would be the first time in my life I was not unconditionally supporting Homer. I mean, a Simpsons ride would probably be awesome (as long as it's half as funny as MuppetVision 3-D... which will also probably get the boot soon, knowing my luck.) but I would never want to discard such a classic to make way for it. There's plenty of room out there, they don't have to demolish the Deloreans. I need a day off before I move back to Tallahassee so I can go Back to the Future one more time.

As a final note, Heath Ledger as the Joker? It's strange, and completely unexpected, but I'm pretty sure that was the point. Ledger is an excellent actor so I'm sure he can pull it off. I don't think Christopher Nolan would have cast him is he couldn't. The Dark Knight - Summer 2008."

I'm such a dork I'm already anticipating summer movies for 2007. The only question is whether I'm more pumped for Spider-Man 3 or The Simpsons Movie? Probably Homer.

""The Fraud Prince"" is actually shooting in Canada, so if I go to work with my uncle (which is still very possible but not definate) I'm heading north and not west. I don't think I'd be gone the whole summer, so I'll still need another job to pay for either tuition or rent next year. My mom said she Dad would pay for one, but if I don't get Bright Futures back (which is likely... I suck) then I'll have to pay for the other myself. Chances are that Mom and Dad will be paying tuition and I'll be working to pay the rent. *sigh* At least there's a Movie Gallery that's walking distance away from the apartment.

I bought Vol. 4 of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" because it was only $20. It rules.

"event","I turn 20 tomorrow. Many of my friends have already reached that milestone and can probably tell me that it's nothing special. What I thought I might do, seeing as how a quarter of my life is done and over with, is write down a retrospective of some of the most memorable events of the past 20 years. It may be quite long, and in no way will it be in order. Bear with me.

-""Bart Gets an F"". The first Simpsons episode I ever watched and still one of my favorites.
-All those times I would play with Douglas and Danny and we would make Douglas be the bad guy. We could never play X-Men, because Danny and I would always fight over who got to be Nightcrawler.
-Watching a Garfield cartoon and deciding to name my teddy bear after his: Pooky.
-Drama Camp 2000. My rookie year. So many memories. Camp memories in general are way too plentiful to include them all here. Hell, I could write a novel just based on the musicals.
-That time we were at Bowser's castle in Super Mario World and Douglas tripped over the cord and erased the whole game.
-Getting into Pooh Bear, my first RST play as a cast member. I was a skunk, and I sucked. No emotion.
-Speaking of RST, which role do I remember more fondly, Tweedle-Dum or Mr. Dussell? There were both super-important to me. Don't make me choose.
-My mom saying ""You should rent Back to the Future. You'll probably like it.""
-Going to Disneyland and being so pumped to meet Donald that I wore my Donald shirt, Donald duckbill hat, Donald suspenders (!) and carried around my Baby Donald stuffed animal all day long.
-Seeing Coldplay live and watching Jon bounce up and down from across the stadium when they played Ring of Fire. Also, practically touching Chris Martin as he ran by during In My Place.
-Lots of Band memories, many of which come from the Common Mafia, many of which come from Chris. I'll never forget mine and Chris's senior speeches, or all the sousaphones we broke, or that time I yelled at Ms. Chapman in class, or sneaking out of Full Orchestra to hang out in the drama room, or making Doug help me carry my sousaphone case all over Wide World of Sports. Band, like Drama Camp, could take up its own novel worth of memories.
-When we moved to Florida, our house still had occupants, so we got to live in the Radison Resort at the Port for five days. They had a waterslide!
-Yeah, the going away party. All my friends from school showed up. Michael Cook got me a hat that I still have to this day, and Kathy Snyder gave me a Garfield stationary that is still not fully used up.
-My Pee-wee Herman Halloween costume... both times.
-""Moulin Rouge"", a movie I simultaneously love for being awesome and hate for skewing my perception of relationships. I've never really been the same since.
-TV Production. Insincere Pagurid, Handsome Pete, Soaring Penguin (of which I was not a member) and Well Played. AV Squad, whomping, Over-Prom, tackling, Prom Conquistador, Dimension. ""Forgetting"" to tape those Real World assholes.
-Going to State. Everything about it. Jon humping the bed, escaping the convention center and buying beef jerkey at the Publix across the street, competing even though I never got a Superior.
-Blake and me, sitting on the truck, drinking soda after soda and just hanging out for hours.
-Ilene Ross and the walk to Justin Elementary. Every single day for 4 years.
-Ilene's house always being full of kids because her mom ran a day care service.
-Waking up on Christmas morning and finding a Sega Genesis with Sonic the Hedgehog, beginning a lifelong love affair with Sega and the Blue One.
-One day at lunch in 8th grade when Doug said to me ""Hey, Chris and I are doing an Indiana Jones movie after school. Wanna be in it?"" The birth of Unwanted Pictures.
-All the years I spent playing basketball. I was pretty damn good. I was MVP of the YMCA.
-Seeing Brian Wilson perform SMiLE live. God, that was one of the best experiences of my life.
-Getting accepted to FSU. It's not too difficult, but it still meant a lot to me.
-Asking Heidi out, and her saying yes. That was probably the single nicest thing anybody could have done for me at that point in my life. I still love her.
-The scavenger hunt. Bill getting kicked out of Taco Bell, Doug ripping his shirt on that fence, some stoned guy offering us art made out of reeds on the beach ('making out')... and only getting second because none of us were old enough to get into Fairvilla.
-The countless hours Emily Penn and I spent together when we were only three years old. She was my first best friend. She's probably forgotten me, but I will always remember her.
-Signing my lease for next year's apartment with Chris. Badass.
-Ralph and Scratchy. My kitties.

That's all I can think of at the top of my head.

It's been a long twenty years.

Here's to the next twenty."

-Saw Coldplay live. They were fucking incredible. Anyone who says they can't rock out is sadly mistaken.
-Hung out with Danny for a few days. We did a lot of cool stuff like watch his movies, play Smash Bros. as the princesses, and buy Waterworld.
-Watched the biggest upset in the history of the Oscars. I liked Brokeback Mountain better and I have a feeling that it will stand the test of time better than Crash (what do more people remember, Ordinary People or Raging Bull?)
-Baked a cake for Heidi's birthday, an adventure.

It's another strong category, or maybe I haven't seen enough movies.<br /><br />Also, I would just like to state once again how pleased I am with the animated feature category this year. Originality and creativity were rewarded. Regardless of whether Corpse Bride, Wallace &amp; Gromit, or Howl's Moving Castle wins, I hope this sends a message to Hollywood that CG is not a substitute for classic storytelling. Apparently, it already has; Disney is reopening their hand-drawn animation department.<br /><br />Have fun at the Oscars!</p>"

Speaking of the show, it was great (particularly that boy from the same gene pool as me). I'm going see it two more times, like I do everytime I come home the same weekend as a show. If Mrs. Davis really doesn't come back, at least she went out on an excelllent play.

<P>1. <STRONG>Quarters are gold.</STRONG> (I've got a card, but a lot of machines won't take it.)<BR>2. <STRONG>Two meals per day is the standard.</STRONG> (I typically only eat one full meal)<BR>3. <STRONG>Road trip whenever possible</STRONG>. (I don't have a car)<BR>4. <STRONG>Going to the mailbox was never an ego booster/breaker before</STRONG>. (This is true)<BR>5. <STRONG>You will begin to nap again</STRONG>. (None of my classes start before noon this semester, so I don't nap much)<BR>6. <STRONG>Your bookstore bill will almost equal tuition</STRONG>. (True)<BR>7. <STRONG>Squirt guns = Stress relief</STRONG>. (I don't really know what this means)<BR>8. <STRONG>Instant messenger becomes an addiction.</STRONG>&nbsp;(I've never been a big IMer. Nothing's changed)<BR>9. <STRONG>E-mail becomes your second language</STRONG>. (This is slowly becoming true)<BR>10. <STRONG>College students throw paper airplanes too.</STRONG><BR>11. <STRONG>You never realized that so many people were smarter than you</STRONG>.<BR>12. <STRONG>College football is the coolest thing on the planet</STRONG>. (I hate football and all the hype that surrounds it)<BR>13. <STRONG>Western Europe could be wiped out by a horrible plague and you wouldn't know, but you can recite last week's re-run of The Simpsons verbatim.</STRONG> (This has been true of me since I was in the first grade)<BR>14. <STRONG>Cartoons are for all ages, especially Scooby Doo.</STRONG> (Same thing. I was watching my Donald DVD earlier today. Also, only the original episodes of Scooby-Doo are any good)<BR>15. <STRONG>Disney movies are more than just classics</STRONG>. (Maybe Disney movies pre-1998, when they decided that they would start sucking a lot)<BR>16. <STRONG>You will never rent more movies in your life</STRONG>. (I don't have to. Student Life Cinema!)<BR>17. <STRONG>No one is too old for video games</STRONG>. (Yeah, I felt that way before college too. Can't wait for Twilight Princess and Smash Bros. Revolution!)<BR>18. <STRONG>Procrastination is an art form</STRONG>. (Again, I've known this for years. College is no different)<BR>19. <STRONG>SNOOD is more addicting than pot</STRONG>. (I don't smoke pot, and Snood is a ripoff of Bust-A-Move/Puzzle Bobble)<BR>20. <STRONG>Thanks to Aimster/Audiogalaxy/Morpheus, you will never listen to one of your CDs ever again</STRONG>. (I have iTunes, but I primarily listen to my Discman)<BR>21. <STRONG>It never sucked so much to get sick</STRONG>. (Blech, this is true. No mom to give you an extra blanket) <BR>22. <STRONG>The health service nurses are there because they couldn't make it at a real hospital. Never, ever forget that</STRONG>. (I've never been to Thagard, so I don't know)<BR>23. <STRONG>Care packages are right up there with birthdays</STRONG>. (Hell, yeah!)<BR>24. <STRONG>Campus is only clean for Family Weekend and Freshman Orientation</STRONG>. (Except for construction, our campus is generally clean year-round)<BR>25. <STRONG>Nothing you want to register for will be open</STRONG>. (This happened to me last semester quite a bit, but I love my schedule now)<BR>26. <STRONG>Classes... the later the better</STRONG>. (Like I said, I never have to wake up before noon)<BR>27. <STRONG>You are no longer thankful that the fire alarms are here to protect you</STRONG>. (New Hall's don't work. They go off whenever they feel like it)<BR>28. <STRONG>Jeans may be worn as many times as the wearer desires</STRONG>. (I thought this way in high school too) <BR>29. <STRONG>The only time to dress up is when your jeans are dirty</STRONG>. (I guess.)<BR>30. <STRONG>Showers become less important; sleep becomes more important</STRONG>. (Yes)<BR>31. <STRONG>Asleep by 2:30 am is an early night</STRONG>. (lol. This used to be the case for me. Some nights I wouldn't even go to sleep. This hasn't really been the case this year, though)<BR>32. <STRONG>Creativity in the dining halls is key... </STRONG>(I do most of my best thinking and brainstorming when I'm eating. You listening Chris?)<BR>33. <STRONG>The freshman 15 is NOT a myth!!</STRONG> (It was for me. The <EM>Sophomore</EM> 15 is what got me. I'm fat.)<BR>34. <STRONG>If it's snowing out, the only reason you will leave your room is for food or alcohol</STRONG>. (It doesn't snow here very often)<BR>35. <STRONG>Dishes smell after days of piling up</STRONG>. (Nobody knows this better than New Hall room 2313)<BR>36. <STRONG>Cereal makes a meal any time of the day</STRONG>. (I had Cookie Crisp for lunch yesterday)<BR>37. <STRONG>You will eat anywhere that is a buffet</STRONG>. (Our dining hall is technically a buffet, I guess)<BR>38. <STRONG>You will eat anything that is free</STRONG>. (I've invaded banquets and dinners for dorms I don't live in)<BR>39. <STRONG>New additions to food groups: beer, ramen, and pizza</STRONG>.

Even hough I have not seen Match POint, Brokeback Mountain or Good Night and Good Luck yet, I feel no qualms about officially naming Batman Begins as my favorit movie of the year. I saw it in theaters 5 times. It just had everything.

Munich, Crash, Cinderella Man, Walk the Line... all fantastic films, but Batman reigns supreme.


I didn't bring any videogames up this semester except fot the DS, and only a few movies that were really important to my (my mother would have preferred that I bring none so I smuggled a handful in my backpack). She said to read if I have any downtime, but I accidentally left my box of books at home, so they need to be fedexxed up to me.

Maybe I'll finally settle down and stop suckng at school."

I can't wait to go home. I really can't. I want to go see Kong with my family and Heidi.

I also just want my friends. I miss them. I'm never on IM and I don't call them a lot since I tend to not use my phone very often. Jon has called me a few times, and Doug did once, but its still a poor substitute for seeing the guys in person. Waka-2 will be a blast and I'm certain that filming it will be the highlight of my vacation.

Yesterday I walked to class with Matt Shapiro and it was probably the most individual time I have ever spent with him. I think he dislikes the fact that I like Batman even though I don't read a lot of comics. But he's a cool guy. Having lived with him for an entire semester it's nice to know that we might actually get along."

Basically I ate a lot of food, tried my best to catch up with Doug and hung out around the house relaxing. Nothing too special, but I wasn't exactly looking for some earth-shattering experience."

"event","Fox has cancelled Arrested Development in the middle of its third season. They will not even get to finish off the season.

FUCK YOU, AMERICA! FUCK YOU FOR NOT WATCHING THIS AMAZING SHOW!

Also fuck you for keeping Seth McFarlane's bullshit that somehow passes for animation on the air.

As if it would kill you to watch a show that takes half a brain to enjoy. The best TV show in years and you idiots blew it. I hope you're happy.

Arrested Development was too good for Fox. A long time ago, in the age of Married with Children, the prime of the Simpsons, even up until the beginnings of Malcolm, it could ahve had a chance. But not today. Fox is dominated by shitty reality shows about kitchens and wife-swapping, and McFarlane's Simpson clones.

I hate this.

Rest in peace Arrested Development. Michael, George Michael, G.O.B., Maeby, Tobias, Lindsey, Marta, Lupe, Anon, George Senior, Buster, White Power Bill, Lucille, Lucille II, Barry, all of you. May you find the audience you deserved on DVD."

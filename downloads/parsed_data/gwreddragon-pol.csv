<B><U>Meg</U></B>
(Starts off with this link, a story about a protest against globalization in India) http://www.guardian.co.uk/globalisation/story/0,7369,1128030,00.html
<B><U>Rick</U></B>
The whole ""globalization"" thing IS rather confusing.

For one, competition is good. Indians saying that they should ban Pepsi is like Americans trying to ban Hondas. If by globalization they mean that foreign companies can sell products to their people, then why not? Obviously Indians DO like Pepsi, or Pepsi wouldn't bother trying to sell there. It's a strange love/hate: individually they love the products but as a group they hate America.

It seems strange to me that many of these people decrying Bush as a global dictator are the same people who are in favor of other forms of the same thing. They all seem to support a stronger UN, and many also a ""world army."" I think that their hatred of America blinds them. I'm no more in favor of Bush as world dictator than they are, but I think that everyone needs to realize that it's all the same problem. It is no more fair to have Kofi Anan or someone else who hates the US hold the power over nations. There is a reason sovereignty has worked for so long: the more localized a government, the more homogenous the people. The more homogenous the people, the less chance there is for a government where one group oppresses another. Now, I don't want all of you to take this the wrong way, as everything is a matter of the best medium between extremes. Reverting to the homogeny of locality is far superior to a homogeny of rich and poor, or a homogeny of ideas. With governments based on the homogeny of locality, we do not need to sacrifice the innovation that comes from the differences in thought and power.

A totally idea-homogenous people would be useless and aimless, but at the same time a world government would inevitably oppress. In this case, globalization is bad insofar as it describes the massive centralization of power.

I'm not saying, of course, that all centralized government is bad. Once again it is a medium between extremes. Government should not be so big that it cannot be challenged should it go wrong, nor should it be too small such that it cannot properly defend its people. But, you've all heard that bit. Before I devolve into thoughts that have been previously discussed ad nauseum, I'll end with this addendum to that previous statement:

Government should not strive to make everyone the same, for then we would lose our drive to progress. But it must also be built on common beliefs, because without them one group will inevitably control the others.

<B><U>Dennis</U></B>
There is one point on which I would refute you, namely the idea that homogeny is best for a government. Madison argued that diversity was the best way to to prevent oppression; the more people the smaller the majority, and consequently the less likely you are to find any one faction dominating another. Furthermore, even though homogeny does have its upsides, two homogenous governments right next to each other can be very bad, like Israel and Palestine, for example.

<B><U>Rick</U></B>
I completely agree with Madison, then. However, it's a little more complicated than I first presented it. There are two factors at work: the spread of differences and the clustering of differences.

Consider the following theoretical society, using Conservatism vs. Liberalism as an easy example. Each 'X' represents the political views of a person in the society.

<font face=""Lucida Console"">
<----------------------------------------------------------->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXXXXXXXX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXXXXXXXX
Very&nbsp;Conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very&nbsp;Liberal
</font>
This society fails because the two groups can find little common ground, as I talked about previously. One group will probably be likely to oppress the other.



<font face=""Lucida Console"">
<----------------------------------------------------------->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXXXXXXXX
Very&nbsp;Conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very&nbsp;Liberal
</font>
This is beginning to look like the society I was talking about, where the ""homogeny"" is high. Most people hold similar beliefs, and are clearly unlikely to form an oppressive situation where one group is left out. However, now we have the problem of everyone being the same. This is bad for new ideas, so we need to find a nice middle ground with a spread of ideas but no big clumps:



<font face=""Lucida Console"">
<----------------------------------------------------------->
X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X
Very&nbsp;Conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very&nbsp;Liberal
</font>
Here, diversity protects the minority because there is no large grouping that can immediately oppress the others. This is Madison's diversity protection: having little clustering. Unfortunately, the people at either end of the spectrum can never agree on anything! Once again we have the problem of common ground. No matter what we do, a large portion of the populus will be very dissatisfied.



<font face=""Lucida Console"">
<----------------------------------------------------------->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X&nbsp;X
Very&nbsp;Conservative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very&nbsp;Liberal
</font>
This seems to be the solution. There is no immediate group to oppress another, everyone can find common ground, and there are enough differences to create an interesting and productive society.




But what does all this have to do with globalization and the centralization of power? Well, I'm glad you asked! People who believe in similar things tend to live together. This works on many levels; a mid-price neighborhood is likely to be mostly professionals who work in similar places, have similar life experiences, and share relatively similar political beliefs. Arlington tends to have more Democrats, while southern Virginia tends to have more Republicans. Iowa tends to have more religious people, while Massachusetts tends to have less religious people. The United States tends to have more Conservatives, while Brittain tends to have more Liberals.

You can probably see what I'm getting at now: the more centralized the government, the more clumping we get! After merging Iowa and Massachusetts, people in Massachusetts end up having to pay an unfair share of their money to subsidize the wants of Iowans. A WORLD government (God help us if that ever happens) would be the most horrible of all when it comes to clumping. A very large amount of people would most likely get the shaft because of it, and it would be worse than a little extra in taxes.

</font>
Two opposing faction clumps are created where none were before. If these two states are separate, both populations can live happily for the most part under a government they believe in. Once they are under the same government, that government must choose one of the two factions to gravitate towards. Oppression is more likely.


We've created another scale now in which we must judge the middle between extremes: on one side, too large a goverment causes oppression. On the other, too small a government cannot adequately defend its people from invasion by another large country.

It is my belief that the Founders had the perfect solution to this in the idea of Federalism; have nearly all of the power in the hands of the states to prevent the clumping oppression whilst maintaining a communal army to prevent the governments from being overrun. Unfortunately, we no longer follow this theory and are slipping ever in the direction of the larger centralized federal government."

Note my mention of the space program and NASA. Bush's subsequent endorsement of the manned mission to mars and base on the moon resumed my ""on the fence"" status somewhat.

<B><U>Rick</U></B>
You heard right. The chips have fallen, the game is over. If Bush can't count on my support, on whose can he?

Why? My political viewpoints are really a trichotomy of those of the Republicans, Libertarians, and yes, Democrats. Dean is the only candidate who can win who has any likelyhood of ending the 'war on terror.' (Mainly because my choices are Bush or Dean) Believe it or not, but the concept of the Orwellian war upsets me as much as it does you. I also believe Dean will be better on civil liberties, at least in the short run. While his big-government policies would probably do as much damage in the long run, they will most likely be toned down once he secures the Democratic nomination as well as should he be elected. In a related issue, Dean is also more likely to cut the military. I've decided that the military is too unneccesarily large. We also need to fund more scientific research. Why was the Superconducting Supercollider cancelled? Why can't we spend any money on the space program and NASA? Again, it seems like Dean is the more likely of the two to support these things.

I've also come to the conclusion that many of the rich are undertaxed. How can I say that with the arguments I just made the last couple days, you ask?! (!!!!??!??!?!?!!!!) Well, I'm glad you asked. The problem is that according to a simplistic reading of the tax code, the rich seem to pay more. In fact, many of them do. However, there are way too many tax deductions and shelters. Many rich people pay no taxes at all. (ahem, a certain Democrat in California comes to mind) Anyway, I think the only solution is a flat tax for everyone with no deductions. I believe that it could lower the tax rate, raise tax revenue and above all make taxes FAIR. Of course, Dean isn't proposing this nor would he agree, but I think that the only way that this idea could be realized is through the Democratic party. There is just no way the Republicans would go for it in their present state. I believe that should I run for office, my best chance at winning the general election is as a Democrat."

Posted AIM conversation with <lj user=n_lande> (Nathan). GWHgDragon is me.

<B><U>Rick</U></B>
GWHgDragon: Um
*** Auto-response from nathanlande: To recap Rick's LJ argument; 
Black people are poor 
Poor people are lazy 
Therefore Black people are lazy 
Q.E.D. 

Porism; 
Poor people are poor because they are inferior to rich people. 
GWHgDragon: Feel free to call me a racist even though race NEVER came up in the argument
nathanlande: :-p
nathanlande: meh, you are perfectly happy to take what is say out of context.
GWHgDragon: You're not taking something out of context, you're putting words in my mouth
GWHgDragon: That is not acceptable
nathanlande: ""To take a phrase from my good friend Nathan, politics is a zero sum game.""
GWHgDragon: Um
GWHgDragon: That's not what I was saying at all, see...I was using your phrase ""zero sum game"" but not attributing the politics part to you
GWHgDragon: Maybe I should have put quotes around ""zero sum game""
nathanlande: i dont see how you extrapolateing out from and butchering my arguement is any different from me doing the same to you
GWHgDragon: You're calling me a racist when it never even came up
GWHgDragon: I take personal offense
nathanlande: where did politics come up in my account?
nathanlande: you are takeing what i said, in a condecending tone, and applieing it to thing which i never did
nathanlande: in a way which i never did
GWHgDragon: I didn't attribute that to you! I was only attributing the phrase ""zero sum game"". The quote was just above where I said that! Besides, calling me a racist is much worse an accusation than had I attributed politics is a zero sum game to you.
nathanlande: furthure more i consider what i have said to be less liable in that you have made that exact arguement in the past
GWHgDragon: I try to be careful about the way I go about it, see
GWHgDragon: So that people don't misconstrue my argument on the very volitile subject
nathanlande: how is my line of reasioning any different from an arguement you would make?
nathanlande: i think we both agree on the validity of the first and last statement
nathanlande: that is that proportionally black people are poorer
GWHgDragon: I would make it clear that I have different reasoning for the relative poverty of blacks, namely that they are less likely to try to succeed because of the fact that they have been and are taught by others (not me) that they are not good enough
nathanlande: and that if poor people per capita are X than X can per capita apply to black people
nathanlande: so only poor white people are lazy?
nathanlande: this seems like a bit of a slippery slope to me rick
GWHgDragon: No, but the reason more blacks are poor than whites is because they are expected to be
GWHgDragon: If they were equally poor then yes it would be because they're lazy :P
GWHgDragon: Oh
nathanlande: so what you are saying is that they are lazy because they are expected to be?
GWHgDragon: And when I say poor people are poor because they're lazy I mean that MANY poor people are poor because they're lazy, in fact I'm almost always careful to say that
GWHgDragon: Yep, because of Jessie Jackson now and segregation in the past
nathanlande: so you agree with what i said
GWHgDragon: Feel free to quote me on that in this way, ""More blacks are poor than whites because of Jessie Jackson""
nathanlande: in which case i dont see how you can object to my away message
GWHgDragon: Because it implies a different line of reasoning. It implies that blacks are inherantly lazier than whites.
nathanlande: i dont say anything about the reasioning in my proofe
nathanlande: i just state that they are
nathanlande: this establishes nothing about the causes of lazyness
GWHgDragon: My conclusions are inseperable from my reasoning. To present them alone is not a fair characterization.
nathanlande: i dont think that is true
GWHgDragon: It is, because most people who come to that conclusion have different and frankly flawed reasoning
GWHgDragon: By presenting a conclusion you are leading people to believe that the most common reasoning went into it
nathanlande: So? i dont say anything about those people
GWHgDragon: But you do imply that I am racist
GWHgDragon: Can you deny that?
nathanlande: I dont think you are rascest, but i do think that you are bigoted.
GWHgDragon: Oh ho, please explain the difference and why I am
nathanlande: well to be honest i am not sure weather i consider your reaasioning to be rascest or not
GWHgDragon: Oh no, you can't weasel your way out of that accusation
nathanlande: but i consider the statement that 'Poor people are lazy' to be a) false and b) bigoted
nathanlande: oh i am still calling you bigoted, i am just not sure weather or not i also consider you rascest
nathanlande: but as far as your reasion for explaineing why you percieve black people to be lazyer than white people, most people who think this have a reasion
GWHgDragon: Bigoted would be coming to a conclusion about a group of people without any supporting arguments and based on a previous disposition against that group
GWHgDragon: I have no hatred for poor people.
nathanlande: most people have arguements for their oppinions, that does not make them right
GWHgDragon: My argument is clear.
nathanlande: bigoted does not imply hatred
nathanlande: than why dont i agree with it?
nathanlande: let me recap the way i perceive your arguement
GWHgDragon: Maybe you're the bigot? No, I shouldn't resort to name calling, that wouldn't be appropriate.
nathanlande: rich people are rich because they work hard
nathanlande: there for the converse of this is that poor people are poor because they do not
GWHgDragon: Or they work hard in the wrong way, yes.
nathanlande: what do you mean by work hard in the 'wrong way'?
GWHgDragon: Perhaps they work in the mines really hard rather than working hard to come up with some way of getting out of them
GWHgDragon: It doesn't help to work hard stupidly
nathanlande: but poor people are still poor because they choose to be according to you
GWHgDragon: Many of them are because society makes it easy for them to be poor, so they don't bother to try to better themselves. Some do try and fail, but those aren't the ones I'm talking about.
nathanlande: so there are some poor people who legetimatly are poor because they are forced too?
nathanlande: what percentage of poor people would you say this is?
GWHgDragon: Because they tried, failed and gave up
nathanlande: oh, ok, so it is still their choice to be poor
GWHgDragon: Anyone who tries can be middle class
GWHgDragon: Anyone who tries can have a roof over their head and food to eat
GWHgDragon: So I suppose you're right.
GWHgDragon: People are poor because they do not try hard enough.
GWHgDragon: Or, they make the wrong choices.
nathanlande: what sorts of wrong choices?
GWHgDragon: Buying the new TV instead of saving their money for instance. A very large portion of the 'working poor' in our society have money problems because they try to live above their means
nathanlande: but they still choose to be poor, so ultimatly whatever they get they deserve
GWHgDragon: They see the commercialism of the middle class and try to emulate them even though they don't have the money to
GWHgDragon: I don't see how that's inherantly bigoted.
GWHgDragon: The poor are people who make bad choices, usually
GWHgDragon: Yes, that's their fault.
GWHgDragon: Minimum wage is a fortune if you only eat the very cheapest food, live in the cheapest apartment, and never buy anything
nathanlande: but the problume is that you compleatly ignore all of the other factors which lead to being poor. The only factor in someone's being poor is because they choose to be. I am not denying that bad choices can play a part in being poor, but there is also a whole lot of circumstances which plays into being poor. Why are the children of rich people likely to be rich and the children of poor people likely to remain poor?
nathanlande: thats not really true
GWHgDragon: I'm not denying that rich children have more opportunities, I'm saying that poor children don't have to be poor
nathanlande: last time i checked the liveing wage in fairafax, this is what the government consideres to be a liveing wage is something like 14$ an hour
nathanlande: and not all of the are, but they are more likely to be, this cant be purly as a result of the choices they make, otherwise ultimatly it would not matter weather or not you had rich parents. Since you can choose to be rich or poor, you would be equally likely to no matter who your parents were.
GWHgDragon: The government probably thinks people should be able to buy food other than canned soup, and eat out once and awhile, and own a TV, and turn up the heater a lot when it's a cold day
GWHgDragon: Did you read what I said? Rich children have more going for them, but that doesn't mean that all poor children couldn't be middle class
nathanlande: but you are argueing that since a person chooses to be poor, since it is entirely their fault that they are poor it is unreasionable for them to expect to be able to leave a deacent life.
nathanlande: i know what you said, and my response was that as a result of this, being rich or poor can not purly be a function of chooseing to be.
GWHgDragon: Are you arguing that if people waste away all their money they are entitled to still eat at McDonald's once a week, eat name-brand food, and own a car?
GWHgDragon: Being poor is a function of choosing to be more than being rich is
GWHgDragon: If you have a job making minimum wage, the chances are the reason you're having problems is because you spend more than you have on things you don't really need rather than saving. When people have money saved up, they are in a much better place to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves.
nathanlande: you are still missing what i am objecting too
nathanlande: that poor people are poor because they choose too
GWHgDragon: They are
nathanlande: and thus deserve no compassion
GWHgDragon: MOST OF THEM
nathanlande: and as i have already established, beeing poor can not purely be a function of choice, thus by saying it is, or saying that most of them are, you are useing a false arguement to justify your negative views towards poor people.
GWHgDragon: What are you talking about
nathanlande: crap, its 230, i need to go
GWHgDragon: My argument is clear: the poor can make themselves unpoor, and yes I agree that rich children have more to start with
GWHgDragon: So for the rich it is less a function of choice
GWHgDragon: But for the poor it is much more so
nathanlande: How can you say that the poor deserve what ever shitty life they get if it is not entirely their choice that they are poor?
GWHgDragon: It IS entirely their choice, for most of them
GWHgDragon: Because most of them could become middle class if they had some monetary foresight
nathanlande: but you have already acknowleged that some people are more likely to be poor than others, not based on their choice, but based on what they start with.
GWHgDragon: Are you paying any attention at all? It's like I'm talking to a wall. YES people have no choice in what they start with. BUT IT STILL IS THEIR CHOICE BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE POOR CAN CHOOSE TO NOT BE
nathanlande: what you are saying is a logical phallicy
GWHgDragon: No it isn't
GWHgDragon: There are two types of people
GWHgDragon: Those who are born rich
GWHgDragon: Those who are born poor
GWHgDragon: Those who are born rich usually stay rich
GWHgDragon: Those who are born poor can become middle class
GWHgDragon: Those who are born rich are lucky
GWHgDragon: Those who are born poor, it is entirely their fault if they stay poor
GWHgDragon: For rich people, yes they have more of a chance not to be poor
GWHgDragon: But for poor people, even though it is harder, it is still up to them
nathanlande: to repeate my self for the third time, you are saying a) poor people are poor out of choice, but you also acknowlage that b) there are things out side of choice which influince weather or not you are poor
GWHgDragon: Now, that is not a logical fallacy.
GWHgDragon: To start with ONLY
nathanlande: you can not agree to both A and B without haveing a fallacious arguement
GWHgDragon: The only thing outside of your influence is whether or not you start rich or poor
nathanlande: that is a different arguement, but by acknowlageing that there is even one thing which is outside of choice you invalidate your arguement
GWHgDragon: Yes I can, poor people are poor out of choice and there is one thing outside of choice that influences HOW YOU START
GWHgDragon: No it doesn't!
GWHgDragon: Poor people are still poor by choice because they can become middle class
nathanlande: but how you start influences how you end up
GWHgDragon: Look
GWHgDragon: If you start poor, you have less to build on. Okay, you got that part...
GWHgDragon: Next, starting rich gives you more to build on so it's easier to stay rich or middle class
GWHgDragon: But C) the poor, even though they start with less, can mostly become middle class anyway
nathanlande: but see, now you are throwing around words like mostly
nathanlande: which are not absolutes
GWHgDragon: Um
GWHgDragon: Maybe you haven't been paying attention but I have been saying mostly from the very start
GWHgDragon: To quote from the beginning of this conversation:
GWHgDragon: nathanlande: but poor people are still poor because they choose to be according to you
GWHgDragon: Many of them are because society makes it easy for them to be poor, so they don't bother to try to better themselves. Some do try and fail, but those aren't the ones I'm talking about.
nathanlande: we went down that road
GWHgDragon: Underline underline bold bold bold italic
GWHgDragon: Many
GWHgDragon: Most
GWHgDragon: Not all
nathanlande: and came to the concluseion that the ones who are not, still are not because they choose to be
GWHgDragon: Underline underline underline
GWHgDragon: The only ones for whom it's not their fault are those who are born with debilitating medical conditions
GWHgDragon: Everyone else had a chance at some point
nathanlande: exactly, that is the conclusion you came too
GWHgDragon: They may not have it anymore, but they had a choice
nathanlande: which i beleave i have satisfactorily proved to be fallacious
nathanlande: thus you are a bigot
GWHgDragon: I believe you've done absolutely nothing but repeatedly say that my argument is a fallacy by repeatedly saying that I said something I did not
nathanlande: Q.E.D.
GWHgDragon: So much for the great liberal acceptance of all points of view
nathanlande: i have made my case three times rick
GWHgDragon: And I have made mine
nathanlande: and i never said that i dont accept you, you are still my friend afterall
GWHgDragon: Time to throw this conversation to whatever sharks are left, I suppose. More meat.
nathanlande: whatever
nathanlande: i really wont have time to respond
nathanlande: at least i should not
GWHgDragon: hehe
GWHgDragon: We'll see"

There is much more to this one in the original comments.
Posted AIM conversation with <lj user=kamikazepigeon> (Dennis). GWHgDragon is me.
Cut: a short discussion of Dean and Dennis getting a picture with him.

<B><U>Rick</U></B>
GWHgDragon: Hopefully he doesn't win, but if he does there will be some cozying up going on
odo8000: why don't you want him to win?
odo8000: cause he's too independent for your tastes?
GWHgDragon: I don't like how he's on the bandwagon about bashing Bush and spending more money on everything
GWHgDragon: Not that Bush is any better though
GWHgDragon: How is he independent? He's just like all the other Democratic candidates.
odo8000: well, we ought to spend more on certain things, and honestly he doesn't dislike Bush, he's said as such, just that he doesn't like any of his policies
odo8000: no he's not
GWHgDragon: It remains to be seen if he truly is a 'fiscal conservative'
odo8000: he speaks his mind, he isn't beholdent to lobbyists, he's progressive
GWHgDragon: everyone is beholdent to lobbyists
odo8000: well, it's relative I suppose, but he has almost no support from big business, the average donation is $27
GWHgDragon: If by that you mean beholden
odo8000: all his money is coming from actual people
odo8000: I did
odo8000: it was a typo
GWHgDragon: Oh
GWHgDragon: Okay
GWHgDragon: You know Bush raised record money from individual donors
GWHgDragon: He must not be beholden to lobbyists either
GWHgDragon: But wait!
GWHgDragon: Everyone is beholden to lobbyists.
odo8000: well, the reason is that those donors are big-business owners
GWHgDragon: They were still subject to the $1000 limit or whatever it is
odo8000: besides, Dean doesn't lie
GWHgDragon: I think it's $1000
GWHgDragon: Everyone lies
odo8000: no, I'm pretty sure it's $20,000
GWHgDragon: I think you're thinking of the PAC limit
GWHgDragon: that's like $20k
odo8000: I'll find out...
GWHgDragon: $2000 per person hard money, $25,000 PAC hard money
GWHgDragon: (Link: http://www.paydemocracy.com/about/political.htm)http://www.paydemocracy.com/about/political.htm
odo8000: no, he doesn't lie...he gets in trouble because he speaks his mind too much
odo8000: okay, and what's Bush's average donation?
GWHgDragon: Under $2000, but my point is this: he had to have a heck of a lot of donors no matter who they were
odo8000: I think the average donation will say alot
GWHgDragon: I don't really see the difference between $20 donations and $100 donations
odo8000: the fact that people who can afford to donate $2000 to a campaign are significantly more wealthy
GWHgDragon: Is it only okay to solicit support from the poor?
odo8000: oh there's a difference
GWHgDragon: NO THE EVIL RICH PEOPLE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO POLITICS STOP THEM!
odo8000: no, but the thing is that the majority of people in this country can't afford to donate alot
odo8000: can we say ad hominem?
GWHgDragon: It's funny because that's really your view
GWHgDragon: You talk as though buisness owners are evil
odo8000: no, here's my view...Bush is targeting primarily wealthy voters whereas Dean is targeting all voters
GWHgDragon: They're the reason there is any money at all for the politicians to steal
odo8000: that was the traditional view, but Dean is proving that to not be so
GWHgDragon: Face it, rich people are the ones that produce money and without them nobody would have any
odo8000: produce the money? What does that even mean?
GWHgDragon: They produce things of value
GWHgDragon: And get money
GWHgDragon: It's basic economics
GWHgDragon: Money doesn't just come from nowhere
odo8000: right, they control the direction of wealth
odo8000: if you want to create wealth then it has to all increase at the same time
GWHgDragon: The more you tax the rich, the more you devalue the currency and make everyone poorer
odo8000: that's not true...the idea of wealth is what the majority of people have, by keeping more people poor you devalue the currency
GWHgDragon: WTF is wrong with you
GWHgDragon: You're a ****ing communist now?
odo8000: back to ad hominem, eh?
GWHgDragon: Why not just give free money to the poor, it'll make everyone richer
GWHgDragon: Hey, you do it all the time
odo8000: because money doesn't have any value
GWHgDragon: You sound exactly like the people in Atlas Shrugged, you should read it
odo8000: it doesn't, it's completely irrelevant
odo8000: it's just a means of exchanging power
GWHgDragon: Okay, so basically screw the economy we don't need money
odo8000: well, in theory, no we don't, but it does make things simpler...
GWHgDragon: Money is a means of barter, and without things to barter the bartering certificates lose value
odo8000: but by saying that we should just ""give money to the poor"" that doesn't work because that will devalue the currency
odo8000: but that's not the same thing as taxing the rich, you see?
GWHgDragon: It is, because money is the reason people make things
GWHgDragon: People want to be rich
odo8000: okay, so you're basically arguing supply-side economics, so let me make a point on that
GWHgDragon: The less money people get from making new things, the more likely they are to just stay in their crappy dead-end job rather than go out and innovate, start a buisness, etc
odo8000: the fact is that more jobs in this country come from small businesses, not large ones...so rather than giving the wealthy tax breaks it would make more sense to give small business tax breaks
GWHgDragon: What is important is not 'jobs', it's jobs with MEANING
GWHgDragon: It doesn't help if everyone has a job if everyone is counting beans
odo8000: oic, and working for a huge conglomerate has ""meaning"" but a small business doesn;t?
GWHgDragon: Nope, the jobs with meaning are the ones of CEOs and people who take risks...large and small
odo8000: ic, so what we need to do is increase the number of CEOs then, so the best way to do that would be to increase the number of business, ie promoting small business growth
GWHgDragon: Because raising taxes prevents people from moving from their humdrum jobs to that of leading buisnesses, it causes there to be less innovation and therefore less companies and therefore more large conglomerates
GWHgDragon: being a conglomerate is safe
odo8000: no it doesn't do that, everyone is paying taxes
GWHgDragon: But the rich pay MORE
odo8000: if anything it give you a head start versus those people who are wealthier than you, ie promoting small business growth
GWHgDragon: It doesn't help to be nice to small buisnesses and confiscatory to large ones, because every small buisness wants to be large
odo8000: right, and when they become large they will have to pay
GWHgDragon: Which is the problem
GWHgDragon: Because they won't be as motivated to become large
GWHgDragon: Thus you have made it so that small buisnesses stay small...
odo8000: that's simply not true, why would I want to stifle the growth of my company, I get more money even though I have to pay more in taxes
GWHgDragon: but small buisnesses can't really compete with huge ones, so they get stamped out in favor of the large conglomerates
odo8000: that's completely unfounded
GWHgDragon: So is everything that you have said
GWHgDragon: Economics is like that
odo8000: by your reasoning, Microsoft would have remained a no-name company because Bill Gates didn't want to pay more taxes
GWHgDragon: No, no
GWHgDragon: I'm talking about the law of averages.
GWHgDragon: On average this is the case
odo8000: I simply think that's completely bogus, just because a larger percent of your money goes away doesn't mean that you wouldn't want to make more money...that just doesn't make any sense
GWHgDragon: The problem with our country is that we need to make it better to be rich. There, quote me on that, sucker :P
GWHgDragon: It's a scale. The more you take from the rich, the less 'more money' they make and the less people are likely to try to grow their buisnesses
odo8000: yeah, just think, if we didn't inhibit them they'd be able to buy out all small companies and their competition and we'd be left with just a few businesses, but that would be good because they'd have alot of money
GWHgDragon: Except it doesn't work like that does it? How the heck did small buisness EVER exist before massive government subsidies, confiscatory taxes on their larger opponents, and corporate takeover rules?!
GWHgDragon: It was a MIRACLE!
odo8000: no, it all has to do with the change in communications
odo8000: maybe you ought to read about the period from 1870-1910
GWHgDragon: So you're shrugging off the fact that in the past with none of your programs we had no huge conglomerates whereas now with many of them we have lots of conglomerates by simply saying that times have changed
odo8000: I'm sure you'd just ejaculate with joy over the way businesses used to behave
GWHgDragon: Maybe you shouldn't be so condecending
odo8000: no, I probly shouldn't...
GWHgDragon: Maybe you should reread your history without picking out just what you want
odo8000: no, we have conglomerates now because it's alot easier to have them, they used to exist in other countries where they'd had time to fester
GWHgDragon: Fester?
odo8000: well, I guess I'm showing a little bias
GWHgDragon: Let's just ban large buisnesses, that'll teach the bastards
GWHgDragon: Oh yes, did I mention that the higher the taxes the more buisness costs and the more likely it is to go overseas, meaning your precious taxes get precisely $0 from them
odo8000: well, we have banned large businesses that use their power in an unfriendly way
odo8000: ah yes, good point...that's what tariffs are for
GWHgDragon: Of course they are
GWHgDragon: So...
GWHgDragon: Do you plan to make teriffs so high that it makes up for all of the money that would have been paid to all the workers for a company?
GWHgDragon: tariffs
odo8000: no, not entirely
GWHgDragon: Wait a sec, all the buisnesses just moved elsewhere and are no longer selling in the US because of huge tariffs, unemployment is through the roof because there is nobody left to employ people, and I guess you need better welfare for all those unemployed people! Too bad there's no money left.
GWHgDragon: Should have given more money to the rich
GWHgDragon: That's what I mean by create wealth
odo8000: it's really a complicated proposal, but basically there would be a punishment for moving companies overseas, but also restrictions based on how they treat their employess overseas as well...
GWHgDragon: Okay.
GWHgDragon: So what are you going to do about companies that are already foreign? And how are you going to penalize people that already left?
odo8000: there is nothing I would do about companies that have already left, they would have to follow the restrictions based on labor rights
GWHgDragon: They just wouldn't sell to the US market, it's not like there'd be a lot of money left here anyway
GWHgDragon: No, I think you misunderstood
GWHgDragon: You can't penalize companies that move
odo8000: ah, but you see, if there weren't any money left here labor would be cheap and the companies would move back
GWHgDragon: They're in another country, what are you going to do? Send the FBI to Korea to confiscate their money?
GWHgDragon: Labor would be cheap? Hah!
odo8000: no, but we can put tariffs on their goods
odo8000: or even ban sales if need be
GWHgDragon: They won't be interested in selling here with all your taxes and requirements
GWHgDragon: Wait, we could always invade their countries and force them to sell us goods
odo8000: all my taxes, we're not talking abouy a 90% tax rate...it's still cheaper to sell here than in many countries, and secondly we have all of the money, there would be no point to sell something if they couldn't sell to us
GWHgDragon: Take Iraq as an example
GWHgDragon: Why do we have all the money? Are you saying that we'll always have all the money?
GWHgDragon: No.
GWHgDragon: The only reason we have all the money is because the climate is nice for buisness here
GWHgDragon: It all comes down to who has the best climate for buisness
odo8000: ahem, so what you're saying is that the countries that are very anti-business should in theory be destitute, like Sweden
odo8000: except that Sweden has lots of money
GWHgDragon: I like your ideas, but I can't imagine why you don't like the idea of invading countries to force them to sell goods to us
GWHgDragon: In the long run yes, these things don't happen overnight
GWHgDragon: Look at things like manufacturing growth
odo8000: no, I think that we will keep raising the standard of living, it all pays for itself in a wonderful cycle
GWHgDragon: My goal is to raise the standard of living
GWHgDragon: But to do that we need to not have all our money move to other countries
odo8000: and you propose to do that by giving the wealthy more money
GWHgDragon: Yes
GWHgDragon: Exactly
GWHgDragon: As opposed to your solutions, mine works in the long term
odo8000: but as I said, promoting small business will raise the standard of living for more people at a faster rate
GWHgDragon: No, because you always have to promote things at the expense of other things. You need to understand that when the government gives people stuff they have to first get it from somewhere.
odo8000: oh no, in the long run the businesses have so much power that they force laborers into horrendous conditions so as to make products cheaper
odo8000: and giving the rich more money means it has to come from somewhere too
odo8000: namely, the middle-class and poor
GWHgDragon: Which would you rather have, a country where any of the poor can become rich but work in bad conditions or a country where there are no rich and in fact nobody has anything
GWHgDragon: Hah!
GWHgDragon: The rich already have their money
GWHgDragon: You're not taking money from people and giving it to the rich
odo8000: exactly, so we don't need to give them tax breaks
GWHgDragon: We need to make taxes the same percentage for everyone regardless of income, at least
GWHgDragon: By the way, that would directly increase tax revenue in addition to raising it indirectly in the long run
odo8000: but by your analysis we should actually do it the other way, tax the poor more than the rich so that we encourage the poor to become more rich
GWHgDragon: We need to eliminate all methods of tax exemption, make a flat percentage that everyone pays, and make it LOW...like 10%
GWHgDragon: No, no...if everyone gets to keep the same amount of the money they make then there is an exactly proportional incentive to make more
odo8000: oh no no no, there will be no incentive to make any money that way, we're trying to promote wealth, we need to punish the poor for being poor
GWHgDragon: Nah, the poor are poor enough if we leave them alone :)
odo8000: I was reading Nietzsche today, his moral theory is not unlike that of Ayn Rand...but I still disagree with it
GWHgDragon: I'm so posting this conversation
odo8000: I suppose the problem is that in a given society only a certain percentage can be wealthy (by today's standards)
odo8000: so to say that you want to promote wealth is a bit of a misconception I think
GWHgDragon: Not at all
GWHgDragon: Why can't more people be rich?
GWHgDragon: In the US everyone is richer than people in poor african countries
GWHgDragon: even our poorest poor
odo8000: well, look at it this way, if 1% of a population is extraordinarily wealthy then they can demand alot, but if it's 10% then they can't demand as much, you see?
GWHgDragon: I don't understand
odo8000: the more people who are rich, the less value the money has
GWHgDragon: How so?
GWHgDragon: I disagree.
odo8000: people want larger salaries, prices for labor increase, manufacturing prices increase, etc
GWHgDragon: I still don't see what you're saying
odo8000: what I'm saying is that money is irrelevant when you're talking about buying power, if everyone made a billion dollars a year it wouldn't have the same value it has today
odo8000: or if 90%, so as not to show the shift to communism at that point
GWHgDragon: brb laundry
odo8000: k
GWHgDragon: if everyone in the US made a billion dollars and everyone everywhere else in the world made $1 it would...anyway I have to finish this program
odo8000: so what you're talking about is exploitation of other people for the sake of our own benefit?
GWHgDragon: By bettering yourself someone else always has less, relatively. If I suddenly made a billion dollars you'd look pretty poor wouldn't you? That doesn't mean I stole it from you.
odo8000: I know, but the problem is that by saying that we're gonna make people richer that isn't a long-term solution either
GWHgDragon: Why not?
odo8000: because you aknowledge that while those people get richer it means that other people are getting poorer (not just the poor, the wealthy too)
GWHgDragon: It doesn't mean they're getting poorer, they still have the same amount of real value.
GWHgDragon: Would you call the one person in my dad's neighborhood that only has 2 cars instead of 5 poor?
odo8000: no, but as more people can afford 5 cars he becomes poorer
GWHgDragon: The way that everyone can become richer...everyone in the world, everyone in a closed system...is by increasing the amount of different types of marketable goods. If there are tons of different types of newly innovated goods, everyone can be employed and everyone can have said goods. That's how everyone gets rich.
GWHgDragon: The only way to increase the number of marketable goods is by making being a buisness owner better, or at least not confiscatorily bad
odo8000: well, I can't say I agree, that's my first point, and the second point would be that the way to increase diversity of products is to diversify the companies, and the best way to do that is promote small-company growth
GWHgDragon: Of course it is! The best way to promote small company growth is to make it better to be a large company!
odo8000: and the best way to make a poor person want to be rich is to make being rich more desireable?
GWHgDragon: Isn't it?
odo8000: no, both poor companies and poor people want to be rich, but they aren't, so it musn't be that there isn't enough incentive to be rich
GWHgDragon: It's a much better solution than making it nice to be poor
GWHgDragon: They want to be rich sure, in the way that people want to win the lottery. That doesn't mean they're motivated.
odo8000: ic, and so what you're saying is that we have make being rich actually desireable, instead of what it is now?
GWHgDragon: Necessity is the mother of invention, so to speak
GWHgDragon: Well, we shouldn't make being poor desireable
odo8000: I don't think anyone wants to be poor
GWHgDragon: Why not? If you can sit around all day doing nothing and still eat why not?
GWHgDragon: It's all about the work/reward ratio
GWHgDragon: Being rich is a lot of work
odo8000: yeah, just ask Mrs. Hilton
GWHgDragon: If being poor is no work, you're unbalancing the equation
odo8000: actually, that's Ms.
GWHgDragon: The vast majority of the rich got there by hard work
odo8000: if everyone worked that hard they wouldn't be anything special, now would they?
GWHgDragon: It's not like rich people just won life's lottery, as your liberal friends would lead us to believe with the use of terms like ""less fortunate""
GWHgDragon: Oh, but they would
GWHgDragon: If everyone worked that hard then much more would be produced...enough for everyone to live richly
odo8000: I'm afraid I don't agree with that
GWHgDragon: I can't see how you don't
GWHgDragon: if everyone worked harder there would be more stuff for people to have?
odo8000: well, what do you mean ""produced?""
odo8000: see, what you're talking about is a surplus
odo8000: which is bad, as you know
GWHgDragon: What are you talking about? That's a ridiculous fallacy. I'm not talking about just a surplus of supply, but a surplus of both supply AND demand!
GWHgDragon: That's GOOD!
GWHgDragon: It makes everyone's standard of living better.
odo8000: ic, and so when my company makes more land rovers because of our industry what happens to them?
odo8000: they get bought? No, of course not, people wouldn't buy something simply to have it
GWHgDragon: That's why you need to find things that people want.
GWHgDragon: There are plenty of things that people want, and many of them haven't been invented yet.
odo8000: tell you what, if we promote small business now we can promote big business later, once that all comes to be big
GWHgDragon: Haha
odo8000: well, you agreed that small business sews the seeds for diversity and employment, I don't see how you could disagree with my proposal
GWHgDragon: Your means of 'promoting small buisness' HURTS small buisness
odo8000: what, by giving them tax breaks?
GWHgDragon: Well, if you take more from big buisness than from small
GWHgDragon: But if you give everyone a tax break I'm happy with that!
odo8000: but the time isn't right to promote big business, we need to encourage the industry of the masses now
GWHgDragon: The time isn't right? Why? Because we have conglomerates that are the result of 'encouraging the industry of the masses'?
odo8000: well, I think you'd agree that the vast majority of people aren't working as hard as they could be, so we need to encourage them...once we have the solid foundation of small businesses we can then move to promoting their growth
GWHgDragon: But what are we encouraging the growth OF? It doesn't work because good small buisnesses don't stay small for long. The only ones you're promoting are the worthless ones.
GWHgDragon: Or, the ones that only serve small niches
odo8000: I'm afraid that your theory has the same problem, you aren't encouraging anyone to work harder
GWHgDragon: My theory?
GWHgDragon: How's that?
GWHgDragon: If everyone finds their own product to make and sell that people want, everyone can be rich. If being poor sucks, people will go out and try to become rich rather than sitting around daydreaming about it.
odo8000: ah, so it's just that simple, eh?
GWHgDragon: Yep
odo8000: and in the thousands of years of human history how is it that we have not created your utopia yet?
GWHgDragon: The climate hasn't been buisness-friendly
odo8000: we can all become equal through unmediated competition...
odo8000: you sound like a communist 
GWHgDragon: I never said anything about equal!
GWHgDragon: I said that we can all have more
GWHgDragon: Of course some people will have way more than others, but is that really so bad?
odo8000: oh, more I see...well we do have more than we used to, and that tends to continue
GWHgDragon: Solely because of buisness innovation
GWHgDragon: Because some evil fatcats wanted more money, and they got it
odo8000: Business innovation eh?
odo8000: so, for example
odo8000: I invent a vehicle that can run on corn oil
odo8000: but that would put oil companies out of business
GWHgDragon: If people want your vehicle, there's nothing the oil companies can do
odo8000: so the oil companies who already have money and power stifle my efforts at business through any number of means
odo8000: they can prevent me from spreading the word
GWHgDragon: Personally I like my oil-powered car, it's way better than a corn-oil car
GWHgDragon: How's that? By acts of congress banning you from advertising?
GWHgDragon: (Like happened to tobacco companies)
odo8000: yes, that's one way
GWHgDragon: That's why we have a first amendment
odo8000: there are tons of things that one company can do to prevent other companies from growing, it just depends on the circumstance as to how they do it
GWHgDragon: And if your car is good enough and you work hard enough in the right way you can take their huge power and turn it into nothing in just a few years
odo8000: companies are no different from governments, and while you want your government to leave corporations alone you can't want corporations to leave each other alone because that would go against competition
GWHgDragon: We need to lower taxes first before changing the rules for companies, so that we lose the conglomerates"

This is an Arlington political flier that somehow ended up in my hands:

<img src=""http://www.gwreddragon.com/pics/taxortreatfront.jpg"">&nbsp;<img src=""http://www.gwreddragon.com/pics/taxortreatback.jpg"">

I think I explained it best to Nathan:

gwreddragon: Oh, oh
gwreddragon: I have a question wherein I am almost certain the Mansfield-Lande law will come into effect, and you're going to like it
n_lande: alright
gwreddragon: Well, firstly wouldn't you agree that if a person making $1,000,000 pays 1% tax and a person making $1,000 pays 90% tax, then the person making $1,000,000 pays lower taxes but also more taxes?
n_lande: precentage wise the guy with the million pays less
gwreddragon: sec let me whip out and scan my political flier that I have issue with
gwreddragon: and it's a Republican
n_lande: but hard cashwise he pays more
gwreddragon: bah need to install driver, sec
n_lande: i dont have much time
gwreddragon: oh, okay
n_lande: could you recount the arguement?
gwreddragon: sure
gwreddragon: Quoth the flier:
gwreddragon: ""Like Vampires, Walter Tejada and Paul Ferguson are sucking the life out of our county through raising property taxes by 62%. Like Zombies Walter Tejada and Paul Ferguson continue on their rampage. They will increase taxes by another 17% next year.""
gwreddragon: Yes, this is a halloween themed flier
gwreddragon: anyway
gwreddragon: The county board has not and will not raise the tax PERCENTAGE. What is going up is assessed property VALUE.
gwreddragon: So I believe that these statements are intentionally misleading
n_lande: i would agree with that
n_lande: and 62% of what?
n_lande: the projected increase?
n_lande: of 100%?
gwreddragon: Property tax revenues went up 62% last year.
n_lande: in california?
gwreddragon: in Arlington :)
n_lande: never mind, i am being stupid
n_lande: and why did they go up? becaue loopholes were closed?
n_lande: or were percentages of taxes increased?
gwreddragon: Neither
n_lande: why than?
gwreddragon: The percentage stayed the same, but properties were worth more
n_lande: ha
n_lande: thats not a tax increase
n_lande: thats people getting more money
n_lande: ok, i agree, that is massivly misleading
gwreddragon: My mom claims that that is, to use your word, tanamount to a 62% tax increase because they could have lowered the rate to compensate
gwreddragon: I agree that they should look at and lower the property taxes in such a case, because unlike income tax people with higher property values don't necessarily have more money to pay, but...it's misleading
gwreddragon: or maybe they should tax people based on their assessed HOUSE value rather than PROPERTY value
gwreddragon: otherwise the people building huge buildings in Clarendon will eventually kick out my whole neighborhood and bulldose it to build more trendy shopping centers"

Here is just one section of everyone's favorite Congressional act: the ""patriot"" act. (Of course, the official name for the act is the ""Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act"")


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC. 215. ACCESS TO RECORDS AND OTHER ITEMS UNDER THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT.
Title V of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861 et seq.) is amended by striking sections 501 through 503 and inserting the following:

`SEC. 501. ACCESS TO CERTAIN BUSINESS RECORDS FOR FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS.

`(a)(1) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or a designee of the Director (whose rank shall be no lower than Assistant Special Agent in Charge) may make an application for an order requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution.

`(2) An investigation conducted under this section shall--

`(A) be conducted under guidelines approved by the Attorney General under Executive Order 12333 (or a successor order); and

`(B) not be conducted of a United States person solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

`(b) Each application under this section--

`(1) shall be made to--

`(A) a judge of the court established by section 103(a); or

`(B) a United States Magistrate Judge under chapter 43 of title 28, United States Code, who is publicly designated by the Chief Justice of the United States to have the power to hear applications and grant orders for the production of tangible things under this section on behalf of a judge of that court; and

`(2) shall specify that the records concerned are sought for an authorized investigation conducted in accordance with subsection (a)(2) to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.

`(c)(1) Upon an application made pursuant to this section, the judge shall enter an ex parte order as requested, or as modified, approving the release of records if the judge finds that the application meets the requirements of this section.

`(2) An order under this subsection shall not disclose that it is issued for purposes of an investigation described in subsection (a).

`(d) No person shall disclose to any other person (other than those persons necessary to produce the tangible things under this section) that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has sought or obtained tangible things under this section.

`(e) A person who, in good faith, produces tangible things under an order pursuant to this section shall not be liable to any other person for such production. Such production shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any privilege in any other proceeding or context.

`SEC. 502. CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT.

`(a) On a semiannual basis, the Attorney General shall fully inform the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate concerning all requests for the production of tangible things under section 402.

`(b) On a semiannual basis, the Attorney General shall provide to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report setting forth with respect to the preceding 6-month period--

`(1) the total number of applications made for orders approving requests for the production of tangible things under section 402; and

`(2) the total number of such orders either granted, modified, or denied.'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, if you'd kindly direct your attention at subsection (a)(1) you may note that under this law the FBI is allowed to issue an order requiring anyone with any information ""(including books, records, papers, documents, and other items)"" to give up said information and not tell anyone that they have done so (subsection (d)). The means of protection provided is only that a judge must find that it is conducted under guidelines set forth by the Attorney General and ""not be conducted of a United States person solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States."" There is no stipulation that the information actually pertain to an investigation of terrorism or that it only be used in such, just that the FBI official claim it is ""for"" that purpose.

To me, it seems like a clear breach of both the first and fourth amendments to in any way take into account any protected first amendment acts when making a judgement as to whether someone's information may be seized or not.

Also note that the concept of probable cause is missing from this document. The Constitution and case law clearly state that probable cause be required for any search or siezure. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that it is okay to break the rules because terrorism is dangerous."

I remember the morning of September 11th. Watching the events on TV, the air was thick with this sort of euphoria of abnormality. This is what people hope for when they sit around casually and ponder what would have happened if this or that. Everyone was excited that something was happening, and at the same time shocked and horrified at what that happening might be. This was a time where we could forget about our sad humdrum lives and focus on something more interesting.

As I drove back to Arlington I felt my heart swell everytime I went under an overpass: hanging from each one was a different message. Here, someone had spraypainted on a white sheet the words ""We will never forget,"" and over there was a makeshift flag flapping in the breeze. The flags were everywhere: on overpasses, on cars, on buildings, on clothes, on TV. The flag stores were all sold out. When I arrived in Arlington I was greeted on Washington Boulevard near the Pentagon by scores of people standing on the side of the street holding candles. We were all swept up in that moment, if not holding candles then watching the resultant 24/7 news coverage that followed for the next week or staying home from class for a few days to talk about it.

In that moment, most of America was angry. For a short time, ""PC"" gave way to hatred of Al Queda and thoughts of vengence. I remember going to a popular weather reporting website and being told tomorrow's forcast for Afghanistan was for a 20,000 degree day, and in place of the usual image of a few puffy clouds there was an image of a mushroom cloud.

For awhile nobody did anything but condemn the attacks and offer condolences, but soon enough the euphoria ended. No longer were millions of people trying to help out or flying flags proudly. Now, two years later, I may see only one car with a flag on it a month where before the car without a flag was the aberration. The politicians and countries who were once silent of their squabbling now are not only back to it again, but also perfectly willing to blame everything that happened that day on each other. Blatant patriotism is once again taboo in many circles, and there are many accusations of people who are allegedly ""wrapping themselves in the flag.""

Have we really forgotten the lesson we thought we learned in those few days right after the attacks? Or, is the lesson that we should learn from this a different lesson entirely? It seems to me now that what we should take away from this is a lesson in human nature. Humans want the occasional interesting event where everything is called into question, but we also want, need and create a sense of normalcy. Even after these large supposedly earth-shattering events we go on with our daily lives. Residents of Israel don't sit inside all day worrying about terrorism, instead they lead normal lives despite it. Nothing really changes. Life goes on."

Well, so much for that idea. Dennis and Nathan went off today to yet another anti-war rally on the mall. I was going to go, but my alarm didn't wake me up this morning and I could NOT have gone without the ""I agree, but for different reasons"" pin that I had envisioned last night. Besides, this is a protest organized by a group funded by Islamic terrorists and North Korea...

I don't think we should go to war with Iraq, but I don't worry that it's all about oil or that too many Iraqis will die or that poor little Saddam deserves another chance. I oppose it because it's expensive, and our government has a responsibility to our people...which, funny enough, is the same argument that proponents of war make. But me, I think that a responsibility to our people means pulling out of the world arena as we know it, abandoning Dennis's holy ""Monroe Doctrine"", and basically acting like a small country. Let the power players have their fun. Let Israel defend herself (because she CAN, with no help from us), let the wannabe world leaders at the EU fix (and pay for) things in the middle east while we drill our oil from the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and develop alternative sources. Where are all of the world's natural gas supplies? North America, Europe and Russia. We could convert some of our cars to natural gas easily (which is better for the environment too, and though I don't think that should be a high priority, it is an added bonus). Let's slash our military budget to 5% of what it is now and fund only military research, three or four military bases, three aircraft carrier groups, and maintain just enough nuclear silos to kill every person on the planet living in an urban area once. The money saved would amount to slightly less than one half the total federal budget.

Half of this money I would pour into scientific research. We could probably send people to Mars for the same price as maintaining an aircraft carrier for a week. Build the superconducting supercollider that was cancelled after congress decided a few more million was too much to prove or disprove string theory. Develop nuclear fusion. Build a SETI receiver with a real chance of detecting extraterrestrial signals, not just an extraterrestrial nuclear war. Fund all kinds of purely research or theoretically oriented programs.

The rest of the money I would put in a ""lock box."" It would pay down the debt until it got to a manageable level, and then the remainder of it would go into a massive tax cut."

Nathan: ""Corporations do not pay taxes, only the consumer."" - Walter Williams
Nathan: ?
[snip, discussion on another topic here]
Rick: It's true, corporations do not pay taxes
Nathan: erm, that is wrong
Nathan: they do
Rick: All taxes that the corporation pays are paid directly by the consumer in the form of higher prices of goods
Nathan: that is weird logic
Rick: It is a perfectly logical argument
Nathan: if what you are saying is that a economics are than i agree with you
Nathan: economics exist i should say
Rick: If the cost of making something goes up, the sale price goes up
Nathan: so what is your point?
Rick: It IS fair therefore to say that only the consumer pays taxes
Nathan: that's like saying the consumer does not pay taxes, because the consumer gets his or her money from a job, there for the job pays for the taxes, there is no point
Rick: I thought of that too, but it's a little different...here's how:
Rick: The consumer, if they have less money, cannot just raise their own salary the way companies can raise the price of goods; instead the consumer purchases less non-essential goods
Nathan: i dont care if it is not a perfact annalogy
Nathan: i do not understand what you are trying to imply by your statement
Rick: So the consumer goes with less in order to pay for taxes
Rick: Therefore the consumer pays taxes
Nathan: ?
Rick: Consumers are the only ones who ultimately suffer from taxes
Nathan: define ""suffer from taxes""
Rick: Of course, since the CEOs are consumers also they pay taxes in that way
Rick: Well, I'm just really saying that any tax on a company is really a tax on the consumer
Nathan: and i am saying that 1 + 1 = 2
Rick: Well, yes, it is obvious if you want to put it that way
Rick: But...
Rick: It's like suing cigarette manufacturers. Who pays up? Smokers!
Nathan: i dont understand your anaolagy at all
Rick: It's not an analogy"

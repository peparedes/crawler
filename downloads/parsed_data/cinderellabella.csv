Of all the kissing types, you've racked up the most experience

							  It's easy for you to take the plunge and make the first move.
							  And you don't really consider kissing to be cheating!</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#FFA5B2""><h3 style=""margin: 0; border: 0;"">Part Passionate Kisser</h3></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#FFDBE0""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.quizdiva.net/kindkisser/passionate.jpg""></div>
For you, kissing is about all about following your urges

							  You can keep any relationship hot with your steamy kisses
							  A total spark plug - your kisses are bound to get you in trouble</td></tr></table>

"event","*my sweet sixteen = worst day of my life*

<ya well we get lost in effing pontiac and 
parents are bitching
then we total kloe's car and the guy drives off>

+umm i wake up to have my mom slam a door in my face
while following it with an ""o ya, happy birthday""
i'm miserable the rest of the day+

:except for the part when shanes wonderful family
like got me a cake and he got me a present and 
everything.
but after thinking about it, it made me sad that 
my own family couldnt even dot that for me:

i finally come home to have my father yell at me 
for an hour and 4 minutes about how my mom is 
pissed at me because she didnt see me on my b-day
but ya notice how they werent HOME IN THE FIRST PLACE
they were yes ONCE AGAIN AT MY SISTERS SOCCER GAMES
because you know thats WAY more important than when
your first daughter turns effing 16, so of course 
i had to just ""understand"" that they werent gonna care
like usual. 

also the bitchy part of me thinks
""thank you for the present i did not recieve from 
my parents"" yes i did not get one thing
but once again, why would i expect them too
i should be use to it by now.

i did get a dress and stuff for winterball tho
so im happy for that, but umm ok 
winterball stuff = birthday present ?
how about no  since my sister will get the 
same thing plus more when shes my age 
wanna know why?

because she has brown hair."

crap on abortion
and even though it was sickening
im still pro-chioce
not just cuz 
""o well what if they were raped""
but becuase i hate to think
what id have to do if i made a 
mistake
(saying this i feel SOOO
unbeleivably cold-hearted, but
i mean really, i couldnt handle
a kid, its hard enough taking
care of myself)"

"event","Wow, I guess it's been a while since I've been in here.  

Things have been really good...  I'm still with Isaac and I'm still at Safeco.  Things got really busy back in September, one of my roomates went crazy so we had to kick him out.  

In October I got two new roomates...  Tom and Isaac.  Since then, things have been better around the house.  Neither one is screwin' the neighbor yet so I guess that's good ;-) J/K.  Isaac's B-day was on Oct 23, we took a water plane around C'dlene Lake.  Great View ! Then followed up with a Movie and Dinner.  I got us tickets to see Sum41 and Good Charlotte.  Concert was great, except that Sum41 didn't show.  They were ""sick"".  Halloween party at the house - good times.  

November was pretty dry... no pun intended.  I didn't do too much, we had Thanksgiving at relatives house up in Newman Lake. 

In December we had a Christmas party.  Well, a few of them actually.  We did a semi-formal gift exchange with wine and champaign.  On the 22nd we had Isaac's company Christmas party.  For Christmas I got a DVD burner, shoes, clothes, and few other things.  I bought tickets to Cher, so Isaac and I are going to that on Jan 23.

Sara turns 21 on the 26th so we're all planned to go out that Wednesday night, but then again on the 29th so we can stay out later. 

I haven't talked to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/lilmikey1982/"">Mike</a>, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/lantsen/"">Lance</a>, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/hpgang/"">Brad</a>(Last time I saw Brad was the Goodtimes episode), <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/douxpluie/"">Tiffany</a>, or <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/upsidedownlemur/"">Amanda</a> Lately... I hope everything is going well :-)

"event","So.....  I haven't been here in a while.  I've been sooo busy and just haven't got around to it.

I've been working long hours and getting ready for the move.  (Everybody in our building is moving out to Liberty Lake next week)

Speaking of moving;  One of my roommates is in the process of moving out.  I never thought It would be only two of us living in a 5 bedroom house, but it is now.

Sean and I are the only two left...  3 empty bedrooms.  But, at least we both have our own floor and two more to spare.

Since the messy one is moving out, that'll give me a chance to clean the place...  I guess that's something to look forward to.... <i>I Guess</i>

People power. To feel your best today, spend more time socializing with others. Attending a party would fit the bill perfectly! But, that's not the only solution. You can also go to any crowded public place where you can mingle with lots of people. Great day to go to a popular restaurant, movie theater or store.

"event","So this weekend I went to Seattle with Lance<lj user=""lantsen""> and Mike<lj user=""lilmikey1982""> <lj-cut>

It was great !! On Friday we left... hmm, around 4:30 to 5:00.  We took Lance's ride.  I drove after Moses Lake so Lance could sleep.  I buried the needle in his SUV a couple times when he wasn't looking.  J/K Lance:-) We dropped Mike off at a friends house and Lance and I went to my moms house in Issaquah.  She let us stay there for the weekend because she was out of town (In Spokane ironically).  We caught a movie and fell asleep...

On Saturday we went to Ikea down at South Center... and went to Pike street and a few other places downtown.  Oh, we had breakfast at Julia's too.  After we left downtown Seattle, we headed up to Capital Hill and had dinner at the Broadway Grill.  It was very nice.  That evening we went to a friends house in Issaquah and drank in the hot tub... it was so relaxing and we had a great time.  There was a couple ""question-ables"" in the tub but we won't go there. 

Sunday we were going to go to Seward Park and watch the Hydro Races and the Blue Angels... but we were to tired so we didn't make it.  However, we did see the Blue Angels when we were on our way to Bellevue Square.  We shopped for most of the day and went back down to South Center.  Didn't really buy a whole lot, but I got a muscle shirt from Abercrombie and Lance got a shirt for Mike... Oh, and a leather bracelet for himself.  

We went and picked Mike up from his friends house at about 7:00 that night, then drove home.</lj-cut>"

"event","This weekend was great... I don't think I could have asked for a better 21st birthday.

On Friday we went out to Matthews at midnight and sang Karaoke.  I got spanked 42 times...  It was supposed to be 21 times, but they made me go through twice.  Then I took a blow job off of Jenny's knees.  My mom and I rocked the floor with some Shakira before we left.

Saturday was excellent, went out to Silverwood with Lance and a bunch of other people.  We hit a few rides then went over to Boulder Beach to float down the lazy river.  I ordered my first drink, a <B>margarita</B> and we floated around the river a couple time, then had a <B>kokanee</B>, It was so relaxing.  

After we left Silverwood we went out to dinner at Clinkerdaggers.  It was my family, and I invited Lance.  We had a great time there and I had a <B>spiked Lemonade</B>.  

The first stop we made after dinner was at Fast Eddie's...  Lances friend bought me a <B>Long Island Iced Tea</B>, the my aunt made me take a <B>Prairie Fire</B> (the hottest thing I've ever drank in my life, I though i was going to die), then I spun the wheel and won $10.00 so Lance and I both took a <B>mind eraser</B>.  

We headed off to the Pub Club to see if Jeff was working, but he wasn't.  We hung out and I had a <B>spiced rum and coke</B> and a <B>bull blaster</B>, then we met up with Chris and Trina and Trina bought me an <B>oatmeal cookie</B>.  By then we were ready to head to Dempsey's but not before taking a swig off of Sean's huge <B>corona</B>. 

Dempsey's was great !! We had a blast there.  Sean, Mike, Chris, and Trina all came as well.  My first drink, on the house, was a <B>malibu and coke</B>.  I ran into a friend that bought me a shot of <B>yeager</B> and then after the drag show, I picked Lance and I up another <B>malibu and coke</B>.  Oh yeah, and between all that I got spanked by a bulky drag queen, that was fun too.  We went upstairs to dance and somebody bought me a <B>B52</B>, but I don't remember who.  I ended up finishing the night with a <B>bud light</B> of all things.  It was like water by then.  

I went home with Lance and blacked out...  It was great!

Lance took me home the next morning..."

"event","This is what I said at work today when I got pissed off.  Everybody was lookin at me like I was a complete crack head.  That happens to me every now and again.  I wonder why this is?  Ok I don't wonder.  Anyway, this week seems weird to me... everything is moving in slow motion.  I think it may have something to do with the fact that it's my last week at work for two weeks, and I'm turning 21 on Saturday.  I'm not for sure, but I think it <i>might</i> have something to do with that.  

I went and saw Irobot last night with hmmm, well lets see, Lance, Mike, Brad, Maura, and Orlando.  I liked the movie more than I thought I would.  The best part was when Will Smith... well, just Will Smith.  Oh yeah, and I stripped in a dressing room at Bananna Republic with the door open too, but we won't go there.

Today is a total nothing day.  Got up, went to work, (stayed late at that), came home and fell asleep watching the Golden Girls.  That's really sad and shouldn't be public knowledge.  Oops too late.  On second thought, it was kind of nice.

"event","No... not because of that.  I went roller blading yesterday in the 102 degree weather.  It was nice being out on the centennial trail in the sun just enjoying the peacefulness.  

Today hasn't been bad..  I was late to work (again).  I didn't end up getting off today until 6 because I've been slacking off all week.  I only had 5 people tell me to rott in hell today instead of the regular 6... I'm makin progress.  

I got my Independent Adjusters License in the mail today... yey.  I'm actually legal now.  When I was going through the mail and saw mail from Washington State, I figured it was just another update on that 1,200.00 ticket I got in April (Don't ask).  It was such a delightful surprise to see good news instead.

I'm about to start cleaning this house, not that I want to, but somebody has to do it.  I just got news that my sister is moving back in so we're moving stuff around and making arrangements.  Her and the baby daddy jus can't get along.  Don't you hate that?  

Anyway, I'm pretty excited right now... I'm looking forward to a fun weekend camping up at Lk. Roosevelt (never been there).  And, I can't believe I'll be 21 in a week.  People said said time would slow down when I got close, but it hasn't.

Work went by like Oprah on a good day...  Let me rephrase that, work was slow and thick.  J/K I like Oprah.  Anyway, after work it was like 101 degrees out.  I didn't want to stay inside.  When the weather gets real nice it makes me want to go soak up the sun... (Not to be confused with Sheryl Crow).  She should be crucified for that one.  

Sean (older brother) and I wend roller blading on the centenial trail.  It was nice to get out on my blades again.  I've only been out like twice this year.  I was smart and didn't take a water bottle, so I had to drink some whitish brown water out of a raunchy drinking fountain.  Pardon the visual.  

On any account.... I just got done bouncing the checkbook... I mean, balancing the checkbook.  We all know how fun that is (for those of us who do it).  Right Mike? <i>""can you hold that $40.00 check Lance?""</i> J/K... that was a stab.

I think it's time to wrap things up for the night.  I'm exited for Lance to call me when he get's done w/ his homework.  I want to talk about the ""day after"" if you know what I mean.  Although, I know he's doing good because he's such a strong person.  He's got a head on his shoulders.  No no no, not that kind of head.  Damn, I better go now.

"event","So yea...I graduated last night. What an irritating and interesting night. Well first of all...No one knew their order nor would attempt to figure it out so that was a big irritating mess. Then While we're outside figureing it out..It starts to rain...and our color of choice for the females to wear you ask? WHITE!!! So yea..needless to say we ran inside and firgured it out form there. We were in the locker room of CCBC for atleast a half hour..it was hot as fuckin shit in there. So after we finally make our entrance n get to sit through all the B S stuff..we finally start hearing the names be called. Well half way through that something only Ive ever heard of happening to the class of 06 happened...we had a power outtage right in the middle of the names. It was pretty sweet...we all were amused and started to chant 06 and stomp our feet and cheer. After that not much else happened. I got my diploma and lost my parents so hung with Sam and Keith until they found me. I was a miserable menstral sweaty bitch last night with good reason...it was a big hot mess in that place. I ended up walking barefoot in the rain to the car and my brother sat in the trunk on the way home. ^___^

So yea I leave bout 5am tomorrow to head down to Senior week..really fucking early...but prolly will beat alot of traffic...I hope..."

We spent most our night in line but *shrugs* we still got to hang out with a ton of our friends. Me and Keeeff looked like Bonnie and Clide ^___^ and were frequently called the best looking couple there. :D Ill post pictures when I get around to it. :P But after party pissed me off a bit but nothing major, we left there round like 230am and went back to his house.

"event","Kevin has started to come around, I fought him tooth and nail trying to get him to open up to me and wanna be with me without all this not rushing into it B S. Last night we had a talk about how I dont think I can sit back a tolerate his drug habits. I dont think I should have to put how I think/feel on the back burner and WAIT for when he wants to stop smoking. Hes doing the last bit of his acid on saturday I think...and hopefully its the last time. I really cant handle him doing all that and I dont wanna have to just live with it. I love him and I know hes better than that, he quit for me once he should do it again, if he truly loves me and cares for how I feel. I know I have to consider him too but Im sorry I need to think of myself too cuz Im not getting back into being with him again knowing Im not gonna be happy. Im gonna fix it first n if it cant be fixed Ill move on. But last night after that convo he told me he has been waiting for me to ask him back out, and he didnt care that he doesnt wanna rush into it agian cuz he loves me. I love him too...Im just scared its gonna have a bad result again but Im really gonna work with him and try n resolve our differences and try n be less controlling n more open to what he likes (not drugs).

Im feeling kinda confused again though cuz now im getting what i wanted, kevin back, but then I have horribky strong feelsing for Keith again. Theres so much freakin tension between us its rediculous. We had to FIGHT ourselves to hold back from kissing yesterday. I was flirting with him uncontrollably all day and when I wasnt with him I was in a crabby mood. Iunno...Im so confused...Im told I deserve better than Kevin but that doesnt change MY own opinion of him and the fact i LOVE him very much.

"event","Yesterday was an all around interesting day. ^__^ First thing was round maybe 1-130? somewhere round there I took a walk down to Victory Villa Elem. and met up with Kevin. The first thing he did when he walked up was pull me to him and gave me a HUGE hug ^______^ ::melt:: Then we walked around the back of the school to some steps so we could just sit n chill. We sat and talked about all kinda of random shit and i placed my head on his shoulder and his arm and scratched down his arm and just clinged to him basically. I hesitated at first but i said fuck it cuz what was he gonna do? say no? I doubt it. So at one point he was stretchimng and i leaned over and wrapped my arms around him n i was positioned so he had to do the same and he just goes ""you conned ur way into that one didnt you?"" TeHe. So one thing led to another and at one point we just started to kiss and it didnt stop for a WHILE...we havnt made out like that in ages...was very nice. ^__^ So yea..we ended up walking to this place back in the woods down the street from the school where Kevin goes to bon fires at with his friends. So yea...we hung out like maybe 2 hours? Then we went our seperate ways. When I got home Keith had already gotten there so we hung out for a bit.

Round 530 Jeri came and picked me up for BAJA! We went n picked up Deegan and his friend and headed down to the city. Once we got there n in and everything we had to wait for Jeri's friend Brooke and Melissa. We waited for over and hour but *shrugs* During the waiting time this promoter kept looking over at me n Jeri and then said ""How you ladies doing tonight?, come on over here and talk to us"" So we walked over and he was just asking whats up and what school we go to and all that stuff. He was SUPPOSED to meet up with us later n dance with Jeri but that never happened. O well. Later on he came n found us and took a pic with us ^__^ Best be on the frount of Myspace! TeHe. So yea Brooke and Melissa FINALLY get there and we all start to dance. First place we ran to was the all girls stage! Then we left and Jeri had like 2 dudes dance with her over a half hour period of time. I was just kinda danceing with her dancing with them. Then we were walking around later n these 2 dudes pull Jeri inbetween them and dance all up on here then the one guy stops and pulls me in and dances all up on me. His hands all up in my craotch and he was like leaning back grinding on me and pulling his shirt up...it was pretty bad. So luckily we got away from them after a short period of time. So later on we are just dancing, all four of us girls and then all of a sudden i feel a hand on my waist that slides to my stomache and another down my leg so Im like w/e..its someone to dance with. And I turn to Jeri and lip to her ""is he cute?"" and she does that little kinda thing with her hana. So Yea i end up dancing with this guy almost the rest of the night. Turns out he was the fucking OWNERS SON! How is that for getting in good bitches? We thought the damn promoter was good. His name was Chris and he was a cutie...he looks like hes like 19 but yea...hes 15!!! Wow...just wow. So yea when I was 15 I wasnt going to places like that and dancing like that ^.- Well I did kinda dance like that at 15 at Victory Villa dances...but thats a whole nother chapter. So yea Chris left like that last 15 mins before they closed and I got his # and he got mine so yea. Keith wasnt pleased about that but sorry..im keeping track of this kid...his dad owns the club. Lol. After he left there was like one slow song and I had a fat guy and black guy up on me and luckily Jeri and Melissa helped me escape the fat guy. :P TeHe.

Well yea....I still havnt had a shower...i slept in ym grossness last night so Ima go do that."

But I called him back round 1 and he said he was just thinking of me and about to call me back cuz everyone at his house was leaveing. So yea...we had some rough parts here and there, he was drinking like the whole time and then smoked blueberry kb before we got off the phone. But we talked of many many things n really havnt gotten along like that in a long time. Something i really missed....kinda renewed us. I really am still in love with him and we talked of us kinda getting together one day n seeing how it goes n what happens. We arnt rushing into anything i mean i dont even have the time to make for seeing him right now. Its just a possibility. *Le Sigh* I feel alot better this morning...though i didnt go to bed until after 5am."

"event","So yea...been a LONG time since I updated. Not too much has been going on. I have my prom dress in my posession and I have everything I need to go with it except jewlery. I have a Tiara and the shoes n all that junk, i need a bad and a necklace and some bracelets that will all match n not burn a hole in my pocket. Im so broke, i spent $600 in 2 weeks. I bought my prom ticket, and Jimmy Bosely's as well...that was an interesting thing I just said. NO <em>Im</em> not going with him I bought his ticket so Christina can go and go with him since he didnt go to his last year. Keith bought Christina's (shes a junior) and I bought Jimmy's. <br /><br />Tis now Spring Break which <font size=""4""><u><strong>OWNS!</strong></u> <font size=""2"">So far Ive beenw ith Keith everyday. Friday I went over his house *sigh* good times. Saturday I had to work 8-4 and then we went out with Jeri. That was good times, I love catching up with her. We all went ot the mall n looked of ran outfit for Jeri to wear to Baja Sunday. Keith left like an hour after we go there. I ran into Megan M while I was there and to no suprise she was glued to her phone talking to Matt. So when Keith left me and Jeri tried on about 4 shirts each in Forever 21 (yes I know...a shocker huh?) and I ended up really likeing the way this orange and white stripped tank top looked on me so with the little money I had i bought it. Grrr I have no self control. Lol. So yea after we did all that we met up with Matt P and his friend n by this time the mall was closeing so we headed out. I called Ryan Hines...wow been forever since I spoke that name. We didnt really talk though *shrugs* he works at the Tilt. I wanna stop by and get a hung from him one of these days. SO after that me and Jeri went to Chik-Fil-A and hung with Matt and his friend for a little while then went our seperate ways. Me and Jeri decided we were gonna drive around n then ended up visiting her ex bf Rob Murphey. Wow...all kinds of old exs and shit that night. We were gonna go to Samers but we drove by n it looked like nothing was up so we went to Robs and supriseingly he recognized me. So we hung with him in the fire dept. parking lot for a few and then me and Jeri had the brilliant idea to go visit ""sexy.""</font></font> That would be Chris Woodard. But sadly we ran out of time...sucked.<br /><br />Sunday I had to work 12-830 orginally but i ended up covering for someone who called out n stayed till 9 covering electronics. After that I went out with Ben, Crystal, and Keeeff to see Stay Alive. It was a decent movie. Alot better than it leads you to believe commercial wise. And well yesterday I layed in bed for a good amout of hours then got on here for a good amount of hours then Keeeff came over for about 2 hours or so. Ryan called me ^______^ &lt;3&nbsp; I didnt see that coming but its all good. Well im out, hopefully Im going up keeeffs today!"

"event","So erm yea..Kevin has been calling me here and there for the past like few days. He called me on my way home form school on Thursday and then again later that night when i was getting out of my physical therapy. He called me this morning and pleaded with me and said how much he missed me and blah blah blah. He apprently had a hangover during this as well. Lovely. So it ended up like it always does when we talk, we argue n fight n bicker n just get really stupid. Even when im not with himhes makeing me miserable. Then he started to question my life like who im going to prom with and if me and keith r talking now n all that bullshit. I dont think its business but he claims to be ok with it all so iunno, he lied last time, why not this time too? So yea what a lovely morning. I REAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLYYYY!!!!! miss keith. :( He SAID he was gonna call me this morning n he never did so im sorta pissed. I hate that. But hes a guy n I know he was busy till like 5 today so iunno, ill let it slide today but hes gonna atleast hear that im not pleased.

I went over his house on Friday. Twas good times. We watched Mystery Men and I met his sister n parents. Had a convo with his dad n i got shown around there house, very nice. That boy cant sit through a movie ill tell you that much. Lol. Kevin could barely but keith cant. Lol. So yea after a little while Ben and Jamie came over and we ate crab cakes ^__^ and then went on a drive to white marsh n walked the avenue then drove for like and hour then i went home. 

Yesterday I went prom dress shopping, I FINALLY found my dress!! Took me all day but atleast it only took a day. I love it. Its like a topaz color *tanish for those who dont know* Its a corsetted top and its beaded and it goes into a poofy princess style bell bottom with a little beading on the top of that. I feel like a princess!! Its so out of charecter for me to do all this. The color, the style, and the fact im getting a TIARA! Lol. I dont care u only have senior prom once, gotta go all out bitchs! The dress is $280 and i ahve to pay for it all, plus the shoes, tiara, 2 hair appointments, nails, accessories, ticket, and limo. *sigh* no one is helping me either, im buying EVERYTHING for myself. It sucks, i dont know ANYONE else doing that, not fair. :( O well. Im going with keeeff so its all worth it <3

I have pictures of the dress on my phone, but Ill get some with my camera after the revisions *which r free btw!* are completed and Ill post em. Until then if u wanna see come find me n check my phone lol. <3"

"event","So today I was getting off my bus and the corner house had too dogs in the yard, one was small and chow-looking and the other looked like some kinda of lab and possibly rotweiler mix? Looked similar to my dog for those who have seen him. Well they are barking, doing the usual dog act when a person walks by, when this girl (I sorta know and dont like her) comes out and yells something, to be honest I dont know what(Im on the phone with kevin the entire time), but next thing I know theres a dog walking on my heels and comes up the side of me barking and following me and then bites at my leg twice. I dont know what to do, running is a no no, it will only cause them to chase and pounce on you, hitting them may or may not work, but this dog looked like it would take a few good hits and lash back. I wasnt gonna jump a fence like a fairy so I just kept my cool and walked on, it eventually stopped and left me alone but I was WELL shaken up during this all and tellling Kevin to get his gun tonight and go and murder it and Im being DEAD SERIOUS! He said he will get a bunch of his friends together and go up there if I really want him to. Im thinking about it to be honest, if the cops dont take the dog away I think I should. They will more than likely suspect me though, thats my only issue. My mom was pretty pissed and said when she gets home she will call the cops and file a report. So we'll see what happens. This girl and her group of friends or w/e prolly wont be happen but all I gotta say is that if they come for me they WILL regret it. But Ill update after the report is filed and all that shit."

The musical is moving right along. We have almost the entire thing coreogrphed...there only a few more scenes and little details. I need my Bert Healy scene choreographed, me and the rest of the Boylan sisters. I also need my Starlet part in N.Y.C. done. The rest is really touching up what we've learned..almost everyone is off book by now. We have 2 new songs we gotta perfect and the final christmas scene to be blocked and then its all done with that as well. We are to perform out first Matinee and Preview on Mach 1st. Preview at 8:30 I think and Matinee at 10. The Matinee is due to have over 600 students from all the elementary schools in this area there. Its grown into a HUGE event around here. Im so excited..im not nervous...yet. I know Ill be freaking out in the green room before we perform. *shrugs*

Nothing much more has really been going on. I got the movie Trainspotting for Valentines Day...those who have seen it would know that not very Valentines-ish but heh i love it and i said if he found it that that could be my gift. I went for the traditional stuffed animal, candy, and card deal. 

HAPPY ONE YEAR MEGAN AND WILL!! <3 Love you guys! We MUST get in touch sometime in the near future."

We needed to find out if it was just a sore throat or did i strain my voice from the musical or did I have strep. So they squeezed me in at 6 and she checked that and from what me and my mom gathered I have a swollen gland and need to rest my voice. She gave me the powdered medicine thats one dose...it said ot take on an empty stmache or two hours after eating but my mom insisted it would be ok...I found out the had way why u dont eat then take it. :/ Yay from vommiting and feeling horrible till 4:30 in the fucking morning! Grrr...cuz im sure stmache acid really makes a throat feel better *rolls eyes* O well...I feel a little better now. We also had the doctor check out my back to see what up with it always hurting and why I have stretch marks on it. She said thats really weird so she wants to see whats going on so Im due for an X-Ray whenever my mom decides to take me. Yay..I may just finally find out wtf is wrong with it!! ^____^

Other than that...nothing much...Im paranoid I may lose one or both my roles in Annie becuase Im missing our full choreography rehersal of running Act I. Act II starts tomorrow but dammit I WILL be there...Im not loseing the part orginally given to me..Connie. I emailed Mrs Riggs last night telling her my issue cuz I couldnt do Improv in class yesterday becuase of that fact I couldnt talk right. I hope she considers my telling her ahead of time about whats up...I cant help a swllen gland. *shrugs* O well...we'll see in time.

Upadate ya later.

so yea..New Years Eve was spent 1pm-6pm working in Electronics. The rest of the night I hung out with Kevin. First it was playing video games at his house for mayb and hour, then went to Kyles and drank a little bit and watched them play magic and just laughed at Mikes stupid drunk self (his first time). This guy Chuck there who i guess was a friend of Kyle's mom grabbed him arm and started to pull me down the steps and i flipped cuz um no, dont touch me I dont know you and ur a drunk old man..ew. Then he does it again before I leave...ick. So yea then we leave with Cousin Matt and Lori to go over Justins with him and his gf to have a small bawn fire and just chill. So we are hanging out and Matts drinkin his off and the rest are chillen and smokein and talkin or w/e. Then at one point Kevin gets up to go do something..I really dont remember what..and ends up stepping on a screw that goes through his shoe and he run to the porch and rips off his shoe and sock to reveal heavy bleeding and makes a big blood puddle on the cement which i kept calling carpet for sum dumb reason. So we get him paper towels and bandaids and i put the gauze on the bandaid then wrap it with medical tape to make it stay and to apply pressure...so needless to say...he cant walk...hes on cruches *sp?* at the moment cuz its apprently REALLY swollen and his cant move his toes...so Im thinkin he may od did a little something to a nerve. But he HAS had a Tetnis *sp?* shot in the last 2 years so he should be fine with that. But yea after all that I was freezeing and starviung outside so Matt, Lori, Kev and I all went to Wendys to get some free food then left and went Kevs house to watch the ball drop on the big screen. Kev and Matt played a game of pool then they bounced and me and Kev cuddled under blankets on the couch and watched TV till I fell asleep. Nothing much more than that to be said..Holiday Break is almost over..today is my last day off...then back to school tomorrow. *cringe* I have 2 senior projects due I believe next week and Ive barely worked on either...good thing I dont work all this week, all I got is rehersals on Tuesday and Thursday at 6-9..so I should get them done if I work hard enough! Well Ill let ya know how shit goes."

"event","SO yea Ive been really uninteresting on here lately...I know. Im sorry...but all I do anymore is Get up and get ready for school...walk or get dropped off at the bus stop, Go to classes, Go so Sollers, Come home, 45 mins to do whatever, go to work, get off work and get home after 10, shower, and sleep. Thats All Ive done in a very long time...so Thats why I dont post REAL updates about my life anymore. Sorry for those of you who like to read updates about whats going on but that really all thats been happening. I have off this Friday (11/18) through Sunday (11/20) from work due to the fact that Sunday is my 17th Birthday...yay go me. ^___^ Megan said sumthing about after me going to Amanda's and getting my hair colored that me and her hang out that night...but I havnt heard anything about ti since last Friday. So Megan if your reading this...GIVE ME AND UPDATE! Lol. Let me know whats going on bu Thursday...I work Thursday night but if you call my house and tell me parents that you need me..Ill call after 10 when I get off. But yea..Thanksgiving is coming up as well. I believe Me and Kevin are going to my uncles house....tons of people and babies to be seen. ^__^ We were offered to go over his parents house but personally I wanna go to my uncles and we have already been planning to go there anyway. Its our anniversay on that day....only one more month until 2 years for us. Gosh...has it really been this long? Gone by this fast? Sheesh. Christmas is still and issue...I dont know what Im doing..I believe my family is having it here..but I think Kevin offered me to go to his prents house...so I guess we'll see what happens. No matter what Ill be with him on Xmas Eve. Thats our 2 year anniversary and Ill more than likely have to work..Im debating if I would call out or just go an deal. Probably call out due to the fact I prolly have to work till close..Im not staying there until 10 and then only having maybe 2 hours to spend with Kevin on our 2 year anniversay. Im sure I can request off so w/e. *shrugs* So anyway...Im about to get ready to leave for work now actually Ill update where theres something to be said.

Anyone who wants to try and see me for my Birthday this weekend let me know!! <3"

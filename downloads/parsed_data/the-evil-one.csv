"event","So I'ved finally been to the doctors after about a week of not being able to breathe properly.  Good news is, I don't have asthma, bad news is, I have bronchitis instead.  Am on antibiotics, which sent me on a big panic, cos next week is our all day pub crawl, but then realised is only a 5 day course, so shall be in the pub again in no time.  

Was stupid though, cos went swimming on wednesday night (""it'll be good for me, probably regulate my breathing"") and now its made it 10 times worse with added cough, and so I get tired just walking up the stairs.  Yesterday, after walking up two floors to get to my office, I had to go to the toilets first to re-compose myself so I didn't look like I'd just run a marathon to get there.  And now I have to carry all my boxes of stuff up hundreds of stairs to my new flat on the top floor.

It'll be ok, Nat is coming round after work to take some of my stuff, and then help me carry everything up. I don't want to be a pansy and ask her to carry all the heavy stuff (theres not that much heavy stuff), but if I don't I'll probably pass out half way up.  

Met Grace for a curry in wetherspoons last night.  Was good fun, time went so fast, I thought that cos I went there straight from work we'd end up leaving about 8.30-9, but we didn't leave til 10.30.  Hopefully we'll see each more often now we live about a 10 min walk from each other, rather than see each other every 3/4 months.  She is def coming out for pub crawl, and also coming to my new years party.  Hurrah!"

"event","I don't want to go to Bruge tonight.  I don't want to have to go to bed early cos I gotta get up in the early hours of the morning- I want to go out so I can come home and go to bed in the early hours of the morning.

My only consolation is that my friends are also going (apart from George, who was clever enough to realise how hard it would be to get up that early) so they won't be out tonight without me.

I had to call a guy from the US today at work, and he called me ma'am.  Tee hee.  I also tried not to laugh at how he pronounced Lancashire like an English country farmer. Lanca-shy-errre, he he.  I can't wait to ring him again.

Was actually really busy today at work.  I think now have settled they are giving me more work, especially the product manager who is based in germany, cos he needs me to communicate with everyone else.  I prefer more work than no work, tis more interesting. 

Tee hee, one of Manu's less attractive friends text him last night asking for Nat's number cos he wanted to invite her ice skating with his mates (they met at poker night on sun).  Manu didn't seem to think that meant that he fancies her, even though they barely spoke directly to each other until he gave her a lift 2 mins down the road to her house, and it was the first time he had met her properly.  Poor naive Manu.  I told him to text back and say he didn't have her number (not a lie, I have it, but Manu doesn't).  I did ring her to inform her, but I knew what the answer would be.

She does get all the weird ones.  And some of the nice ones as well.  All of them actually."

"event","Graduation went very well, I didn't trip up the stairs, and I managed not to fall asleep during all the speeches.  My mum admitted later that she cried - and then cried later in the day when Jenny broke the record for the 100m(?) breastroke race for her age group, which she has been working for for aaaaaages.  So overall a very emotional day for my mum.

Ball was good, if a bit boring at first, cos alcohol was having no effect on me whatsoever, and Michelle and Lauren didn't turn up until an hour after I did, so me and Manu just stood around doing the self-conscious, sober dance.  But was good when Michelle and Lauren (and her amusing boyfriend) turned up.  The first band would have been good if they hadn't tried so hard to be weird and different, and then 4th base from X-factor came on (I didn't remember who they were until I saw them), and I think I liked them in the auditions, and so I made a video of them on my camera in case they become really famous and I can make my own dvd and sell it on ebay ;)  Looking forward to their second single.

Urgh, I have so many chores to get done today, but cannot be arsed.  Want to just shop on ebay and play spider solitaire."

Which is what I should be focusing on right now, and not what I am actually thinking about.  Have to wait til Manu gets back to sort it out.  Sure it is nothing, and will prob regret bringing it up, but its bugging me too much just to let it go.

Maybe overreacted last night cos I was a bit drunk.  Was my uncle's birthday party - was so much fun, had a good old granny-style boogie to old classics."

Ash went clubbing in London with her uni friends instead of us, and she may have ended up having all her drinks bought for her by a rich man in a posh hotel bar surrounded by people dripping in Dior, but can she say she had a deep and meaningful conversation with Batman, kicked a gladiator up the arse, and tried to suffocate superman in his own cape?

Just to point out, there were a bunch of people dressed up, I wasn't just wearing beer goggles.

Saw the wonderful Nick, who have not seen forever!  Was stupid cos didn't think to get his new number off him, but had a bit of a bump 'n' grind with him.  Ash was well jealous, but I did callher straight away when I bumped into him so she could chat to him.

Now have my beautiful dress for my ball.  Not a proper ball dress, but is sooooooooo pretty, I want to wear it all the time.

Had my interview yesterday for Smiths Medical, and think it went well.  Made them laugh a few times, and they siad I had a ""good education"".  Had to do a couple of aptitude tests as well, so was very tired when I finished, cos I'd been at work since 6.30am and only had an hour between work and interview, so no time for a cat nap.  Think I have a good chance but depends on other candidates.  Will find out next week, and promised Nat I would call her first cos if I get the job I can afford to move in with her.  She kept telling everybody I was her new flatmate though, so I think she might have jinxed it."

Was trying to convince Kath to split up with her pyscho stalker boyfriend last night.  I don't normally like to interfere with things like that, cos usually it leads to no good, but am so fed up with Kath looking fucking miserable whenever he is around, and hearing stories of his possesiveness etc.  I keep telling her she deserves better, and she will only be upset for a little whle and then she will realise that she is better off without him.  I think she was agreeing with me, but she's scared of missing him.  I'm worried that he will turn into a stalker and she may have to go into hiding...

Pat (lady who I work with) came to see me at work yesterday to tell me that her son (who is some marketing executive) is looking for a graduate to be some trainee assistant type in his company.  He then emailed me the ad (which I assume goes out today), and it sounds kinda interesting.  And apparently one of my neighbours works at the company, so my parents threw me out the house to go and ask her for advice.  Felt kind of cheeky asking her, but she said she'll get me an application form today and also ask about what kind of thing I should put on my CV.  I will have nothing relevant, as my CV is filled with film stuff, but he said no marketing experience is necessary.

Am really nervous, cos would be so good if I got it.  I figure I've got nothing to lose as is just a year contract, and am not getting anywhere with tv jobs.  At least I won't have to make tea!  Not sure how much they pay, but would prob get more than do at the pool, which means I can move in with Nat (and hopefully Kath if we can dissuade her from moving in with her pyscho possesive boyfriend).

Didn't go out for Dad's birthday in the end cos he wasn't well.  So even though was really hungover from friday night, I went to Kath's friend's boyfriend's halloween party.  Me and Manu went as a pair of gangsters, as that was the only outfit I had on short notice (all black with a tie, hat, cigar and toy gun).  Was ok, Luke's friends aren't very mingly, so didn't really talk to anyone much (apart from Manu, Nat and Kath obviously), but played few games of twister, always good."

When I replied that I am doing a whole day at work tomorrow (7-10!) so no, he said ""oh, but you'll be finished by 4"".  So He'll be home by about 4.30, yet he needs a few extra hours rest because he is doing a course, that is probably 9-5?  Stupid wanker.  I'm not fucking coming in for a few crappy hours, waste of petrol.

At 12 I must ring Manu and tell him sorry that I went back to bed in his hour of need, but to stop being such a drama queen and listen to what my dad told him.  Surely if your car is not working, you do not ring your girlfriends dad in the morning to ask how to fix it (especially when he was told how to do it yesterday) but just to jump on his bike and cycle to work and then fix the damn car when you get home.

Then went down to dungeness, and drove round randomly whilst trying to ring Guy and ask him where the hell they were.  By the time he rang me back I realised I was on the wrong side of the power station, and in order to get to the other side I would have to drive back to Lydd (?)  Guy said they would be wrapping in half hour so was no point in coming, and so am now waiting til they call me to say they are back at the accomodation, so I can go and pick up my crash mats and tea urn (also sort out the petrol money they owe me).  Don't know if wanna stay in the pub with them tonight as am soooo tired and really fancy a night on the couch.

Has been good shoot, even though have spent most of it driving around to shops to buy everyone fags and cough sweets, and endless amounts of milk and fruit (very much looked like crazy fruit lady with a big trolley overflowing with it).  Has been cold though.  When Guy told me we were filming inside, he didn't tell me that the house we were filming in was so cramped that you couldn't fit the whole crew in there, therefore have spent the last 4 days out in the cold.  Apparently picking up equipment doesn't let you go in either, cos when tried to stroll in with a battery had the door shut in my face."

Think cos I did an 15hr day at work, followed by an early (6.30am), when I didn't get much sleep in between.  I was nearly falling asleep at the desk, and as soon as I got home I thought I'd have a little nap and then go basketball, and maybe swimming afterwards.  I woke up two hours later feeling like four kinds of shit, and eventually sent myself back to bed.  But I was so hot I  woke up every five minutes, and so I barely got any sleep, and when I did I was having freaky-ass dreams.

Think will still go to Manu's though.  Think spending another day on the sofa in my pyjamas would just make me feel worse.  

Plus, I have errands to run and phone calls to make regarding film stuff.  Hopefully will be fully recovered by next week for my shoot.  Apparently I am responsible for Sainsburies runs when the actors get hungry.  But don't worry, production manager said, I won't have to do any lifting, he will leave that to the men.  He hasn't even met me how does he know I am not a big butch girl?  I hate it on film shoots when the men assume that you can't do the physical stuff.  I told him that I don't mind lifting cos I've done all that when I was a camera assistant, but he said ok, but not the heavy-heavy stuff.  For fucks sake."

Found out yesterday I didn't get the runner job I had a trial for.  My dream of being a glorified tealady was dangled before my eyes then cruelly snatched away.

But found 3 more jobs to apply for this morning, so shall busy myself with that, after have done sufficient cold-style slouching in front of the tv in my pyjamas.

"event","I love lazy days.  I haven't had one in so long, and am sooo tired.  Was so tired, didn't even have enthusiasm to shop yesterday.  Was shopping for dress for grad ball, and the only thing I found wasn't appropriate at all.  It was black with red swirly patterns, knee-length, with red netting coming out of the end, and the shape of a swedish milk-maid outfit.  Tried it on for a joke at first, but fit me perfectly and was soooooo pretty, but is not appropriate for grad ball, and even tho looked beautiful, knew would get strange looks from people.  

I wish I had bought that pretty skirt from H&M yesterday, but I was worried I'd have nothing to go with it.  Will check my wardrobe, and if I find several things, will go and buy it from canterbury branch. 

Was not a complete waste of a day though, bought myself a pretty Ann Summers bra, and birthday cards for Laura, Katharine, and George.  But will go shoping in canterbury some time soon to get their presents.

Trial day went ok.  Realised this job is just glorified tes-maker.  Thought there would be other aspects to the job, but no, thats it.  Still, people are nice, and get my lunch paid for.  And contract is only 6 months.

Going to pub with David later.  At first he told us he didn't finish work til 10, so were just gonna meet him after, and I was gonna go round Manu's for dinner before hand, but now he says hes free from 4.30.  Manu won't be pleased, cos I was spose to go round his for dinner last night and didn't cos had to drop ash off home from london.  Now I won't see him til monday. hymph.  Unless he shocks me and comes along for a drink.  I'd rather he did, because I don't think David likes me anymore since I let him down over waitressing job.

Right, am going to give my bunny a bath and a haircut."

"event","Don't really have time to update, but am putting off all the other things I have to do this morning.  Like phone bloody Kris and ask me if he is still holding auditions tomorrow and if he still wants me there.  If he does, I have to type up some audition forms, which I should have done ages ago, instead of the day before.  Then have to ring Kit and let him know whether I will be on his shoot or not tomorrow.  Think would rather do Kit's shoot, except I would prob have to get up earlier.

Also might try and make some business cards.  Gillian (sound lady) discussed it with me the other day, and think it would be good to make me look more professional, and maybe get a paid job.  

Meal was lovely last night, although I was falling asleep half way through it cos was so tired from my working week ending in a drunken night out in the pris (do not remember anything from that).  As a goodbye present to Ash, whilst she was getting drinks at the bar, Nat decided to give Ash a ""shot"".  After she downed it (thinking we'd just got her a shot of tap water), we admitted we'd given her the water that was used for the flower in the middle of the table (shot glass used as a vase).  Will remember that moment forever.

Hasn't sunk in that Mel is leaving next week, and cos am in London all week, will prob not see her again before she goes.  Will miss our little MEl, all grown up going off to uni *sniff*  Ash leaving does not have the same effect on me, as she is going to London to live with my auntie for a year, so will see her when I go up there for film shoots and stuff."

Trouble is, have just found an ad for a job which would be PERECT for me - tis trainee camera operator in video production company.  Am worried, because now don't really want this runner job, and afraid that will come across in the interview, and if I don't get trainee camera job, will be stuck working at the fucking pool.  Am pissed its taken this long just to get an interview - is the only one have been called in for, and am applying to shit loads of jobs every week.  My cv must look really crap.

Will just hope it all turns out ok.

Will be keeping myself busy this week, as have been given lots of jobs from one of the films I'm working on.  Am production assistant, so have to chase up locations, catering, accomodation, etc.  Is just if I get another full time job may not have so much spare time on my hands to do these things, especially as am production assistant on two other projects coming up as well.


Wish they were paying me!  Then could quit my shitty job and work from home!"

"event","Last night was bloody fantastic.  Laughed so hard at various things, and when I had flashbacks this morning I luaghed even more, such as George jumping on Katherine and the pairing of them falling through the fire exit on the floor, Steve siting on a wall and being so pissed that he fell head over arse and needing 3 of us to lift him up again, and walking home barefoot and falling over on the grass (after Katherine chased me to throw grass at me).  Am also triumphant as stole a Corkys poster from the toilets, which Nat has decided resembles me and her - ""what a pair of winkers"" hehehehehe.

However, am getting more and more wound up by Sarah.  She also seems to try and ruin everyone else's night out by stating how bollocks she thought the night was, even though everyone was clearly enjoying themselves.  She stated last night that she feels she is too old to wear short skirts (fair enough) and then this morning she said she doesn't enjoy clubbing anymore (understandable), and she thinks that we are so sad to still be going down the pris every weekend when everyone there seems to be about 4 years younger than her.  She seems to forget that her good friends George and Katie are also 4-5 years younger than her - is she too sad to be hanging round with them?  Who gives a shit what age we are as long as it is still fun?  She is just too busy caring what other people think to enjoy just spending time with her friends.

But I don't know what she's gonna do, cos no matter what she says, she is not stopping the rest of us going, but she won't like being left out, so she will still come, and continue to spoil our good nights.  Was a big group of us last night tho so I just ignored her when she was being annoying.

Also pissed me off cos when I showed her my pretty diamond ring that Manu bought me, she simply said ""its fake"".  When I said I didn't think it was, she said ""but if it was real it would cost quite a bit of money"".  How the fuck does she know how much Manu spent on it.  I don't know, and I don't care, cos I love it, but just to assume it can't possibly be real just cos I am wearing it.

Right, rant over, am going to sit in the garden and read the scripts that people have sent me to look at."

"event","Last night was fantastic.  Party was good, but when we got bored of twister, and watching Manu and Katie battle it out on Sarah's 8 yr old brothers ps2 game, we stumbled down to the pris, when I danced like a complete nonce, because I was pissed and didn't give a shit what people were thinking.  And Laura and Sam came out for the first time in months, so I was very overexcited.

Some stupid bitch trod on my foot with her stilleto heel though, because she thought I was coming on to her boyfriend - in fact he had elbowed me in the head so I turned around and pretended to be in a lot of pain to make him feel bad, but because we were both laughing, she pushed me out the way and had a go at him.  SHe must have issues.  I was about to have a go at her but Manu pulled me away I got caught up in my crazy lady dancing instead.  I only remembered this morning cos it was throbbing and bruised.

Surprised my feet were more cut up as my flip flop broke, so I was walking around bare foot like some kind of mad woman.  Stupid cheap Shoe Zone.

Called in sick today as was not emotionally strong enough to drag myself into work with a hang over and a cold.  Hate my job so much, feel like calling in sick everyday, but I need the money in case I don't get another job some time soon.

Reminds me, should have a shower, as have been in pyjamas all day, just put jeans on to go home from Manus but have on the same t-shirt I slept in.  Didn't feel I deserved to sit in the sunshine when I claimed to be sick with a bad cold."

"event","Film shoot was fantastic.  Think will be very good film, and was a lovely bunch of people.  DoP was sweet spanish man, and we got on really well, so it all went smoothly.  With the exception of the runner who was a complete chavanistic wanker who didn't have a single clue about making films.  I didn't mind him asking questions, but he asked them at the wrong time, and was always in the bloody way, and I didn't trust him with any of the equipment.  He kept trying to take the heavy stuff off me, which would be gentlemenly if he wasn't the size of a matchstick.  He seemed to think I was a complete wimp just becuase I am a girl, and he was strong just cos he is a man.  Urgh.

Anyway, hoping Daniel (DoP) will be contacting me about his film (he asked me to produce it for him), but just in case, I might send him a text and ask him about it, in case he forgets about me.

Was getting all depressed before because no-one wanted me to work on their films.  When I got back this week however, I find two emails from people who I met a few months ago asking if I was still interested in working with them.  Will call them today and say please.

Just wish it was paid though.  Wouldn't mind if I was a rich lady.

Nat and Sarah's housewarming party tonight.  Should be good, will give me something to look forward to while I am at work.  Although at the moment I am more excited about seeing my Manu, whom I haven't seen for over a week (I know thats not very long, but we are very used to seeing each other every other day).  He didn't really want to go to party, but I told him that I was going, so if he wanted to spend time with me, he had to come.  Especially as Sarah and Nat had changed the date for me cos I was away filming last weekend."

Swimming is getting harder and harder.  Gets to the point were I actually start to feel a bit sick from the effort.  Would like to go twice a week, but the only other training session is on a friday night, and thats my dancing night!  Might have to start going swimming in public sessions, but that gets boring.

My powers of blagging have also been confirmed, when the examiner asked me if I did A level biology after I had finished explaining about how you would tell someone had a spinal injury.  In fact, I knew it cos I'd read my manual properly for the first time that day, and I just kept blabbering until she told me to stop.

Examiner annoyed me sometimes, cos she was a bit patronising and made Manu and Katherine feel stupid, but at least she did account for the fact that people might be nervous, and we do know what we would do in an emergency, but we just can't remember little things (like pressing the alarm) when we are asked questions about it.

Job search still isn't going very well.  Not too bad at the moment, cos have plenty of work at the pool, but by mid-september all the shifts would have gone cos people are back from holidays, and I reckon they would have employed another full time member of staff who will take all the shifts, and I will be left with 7.5 hours a week.

I could always go for the full time position, but then I know I will be stuck there FOREVER."

After that I think I iwll sunbathe, as I am pasty again.

Wanted to go swimming tonight, but have a sty in my eye and it has swollen up so I look like I've been punched in the face.  Not only do I not want to face world, but also goggles will hurt.  Was bad enough was working on recpetion yesterday when it was really swollen, so people kept asking if I'd been punched, or had some kind of bite.

As long as it is better by sunday, I have my lifeguard exam.

Ash pissed me off last night.  I asked her if she would be my 'casualty' for my exam, and she said yes, on the condition that I would be hers when she re-takes her exam (fair enough I said) and then she started going into a long rant about how she does me favours (such as ring up the insurance company for me) and I would never do the same for her!  I fucking do, such as taking her dry-cleaning in, getting her shoes reheeled, etc etc.  We ended up both storming upstairs at the same time after I told her not to do me anymore favours if shes gonna throw it back in my face.

So I'm gonna tell her not to bother with my exam, and me and Linda can just share Katie, cos I can't be arsed with her anymore."

Ended up leaving his 3 drunk friends (who i was spose to take home) in canterbury, while one of his sensible friends came with me to put him to bed.

Lifeguard mock exam went well yesterday I feel.  Feel much more confident, and think I may actually pass.

Got my bank statement this morning and made a startling discovery.  Before our holiday, me and ash tried to book our insurance online, but it said with both our cards ""card not accepted"".  Ash eventually managed to book using her card over the phone about 5 mins before we left for the airport.  But apparently they charged the money on my card anyway.  Am gonna ring ash about it to get details of who she spoke to etc, and then ring them up and demand my money back."

Also has been a bad start to the day because there was not enough milk to have my cereal and coffee.  Dad said he's going out to get some - hurry up dad!

Speaking of cereal, my mother is a devious minx.  She accidentally bought a disgusting cereal called crunchy nut clusters (a combination of my cereal -crunchy nut conflakes - and ashley's cereal - clusters) because she 'doesn't read the names, but goes by the colour of the box'.  When we all tried it and decided that we hated it, my mum, not wanting to waste food ever, thought she could sneakily mix it with our cereals and think we wouldn't notice.  Her master plan was foiled when I told her that I had noticed, and it just meant that I had to throw away the rest of my cereal because it was so vile.  

I know tis a petty thing to get upset about, but I feel I never have a good day if I don't start out with a good bowl of tasty cereal.

Got to wrap Manu's present, and buy him a card.  Tis his 25th birthday tomorrow.  My boyfriend is so old :p

Curry night tonight with ladies.  Ooh, haven't had a good curry and a pint in aaaaages.

I emailed the guy who wants me to produce his film and told him I am working on 2 other projects at the moment, and he said its a bit worrying, because even if he co-produces (which I asked him to do, as I have never produced before) he wants me to drive the project forward and 'treat it as my own'.  I really would, but I don't want to tell him that I'm not doing so because I seriously doubt my skills as a producer.  I think I will wait til have spoken to other people and then will make my mind up.

Which reminds me, have to decide what to wear for tomorrow.  Have to get up extra early and drive to London to meet someone about a pilot tv show he's making.  Am going to be production assistant, so help him with casting, locations etc.  not paid, but if it gets commissioned then will hopefully lead to a paid job.  Oh bugger, still haven't read the script - will get to it, tis 56 pages long!  Know I should but is so difficult when there is the new Harry Potter book to get through.

Asked Manu to be my personal trainer, as have retired from synchro and so want to keep toned arms and stomach thankyou very much.  When I helped Manu change his tyre the other day I realised that all my strength from my arms has completely disappeared, so he's got my doing weights.  Thought that would be worse than the sit-ups but I was very very wrong.  The only thing that kept me going was that he promised to give me a cookie when I'd finished.  But even though it really hurts, it fucking worked!  Don't have to hold my stomach in cos its too scared to come back out!  Hurrah!

Anyway, he told me not to do any today (couldn't if I wanted to) but to do something different.  Was gonna go swimming, but as going swimming tomorrow, will do my hip hop workout dvd instead."

However, applied for a runners job on a film shoot, and after an interview-disguised-as-an-informal-chat, they offered me a job as production manager instead.  Went on holiday extremely pleased with myself, but when I came back, the producer emailed me and told me that it had been postponed indefinetly due to budget problems.  But he said that the director wanted to keep me as provisional crew in case it starts up again, and the producer said he wants to make his own films, would I be interested in helping him?  I said yes, and then a week later he emails me asking if I want to produce his film!  Didn't reply straight away cos was scared - producing is a big big job that involves being organised and efficient. I said yes yesterday, but am worried.  Especially as it is not paid, so I have to also look for work alongside it.

Wasn't all hard work though, had a couple of goes on a jet ski (was a complete pansy, though while Katharine and Nat zipped around like mad ladies), and then we went exploring on mopeds.  Was shit-scared of the mopeds, but got the hang of it, and only fell off twice :p

Apparently have missed lots of things, such as bombs in london, deaths of my neighbours, wife-beating ex-bosses.  Feel bad that there was scariness going on and was completely oblivious to it.

We all had a bit of a blubber after.  Its all ash's fault.  She started crying as sonn as we got out the pool from our routine, which set George off, which set me off, which set Mel off.  We then all composed ourselves for the parade until Mel and George won their duet and they started crying.  Then we went up to get our silver medals for the team and all started crying (even Keeley and Erica, who aren't even leaving).  People from other clubs must have thought we were crying cos we lost or something.  Feel sad today still, but know is right time to leave.

*Written a brief for how I can develop my animation into a series ready to enter into BBC New Talent
*Start my broadcasting exam revision

*watched a vast amount of tv
*sat staring into space whilst listening to my new Best of Brandy cd
*Looked for my notes on broadcasting topics and found that they are extremely minimal 
*Looked in TV guide for various documentaries to analyse and realise there is only one on tonight about Abba - will have to do - but fortunetly found a video with a documentary on 'a history of animation' which I taped last year
*Had a general panic about the exam and realised will probably fail due to lack of research and willing
*text Jim to ask if will be a reference for me but had no reply, and am still getting courage to call producer from film last summer to be a reference

However, I did spend over 4 hours last night updating my cv, with the help of my lovely big sister who is the Queen of writing CVs specific to jobs.  She seemed to have magically made me a more intersting and articulate person (on paper).  Even though the job isn't what I wanna do forever, it would be good just to get away from lifeguarding, and the impending doom of a possible waitressing job.  Would also hopefully build up my contacts within the industry.   And theres the wonderful prospect of actually having regular money.  Only downside is I would have to either live with my auntie or commute to London everyday.  Will probably do a combination of both.

Right, should really work my way through my to-do list."

Have to go home soon cos have to pick up some stuff before I go to Manu's, but I want to sit and play with my new phone :("

"event","On Monday I dropped my concealer down the toilet.  Yesterday night I thought I was placing my phone on my phone-holder (the light was off, I would like to note here) and when I heard a big splosh I realise I had in fact dropped it in my glass of water.

Therefore, I haqve learned that all containers of liquid must be approached with caution, particularly when holding daily essentials such as phones and concealers.

My phone is pretty much buggered I think.  Opened it up and dryed the water out, then left by the radiator to dry over night.  Put it all back together this morning, and although it turns on, it claims to have no signal, and no battery, even though I only charged it at the weekend. Is also extremely hot, worried might cause mini-explosion.

Best start looking for another phone.

Nat came round last night so we could research holiday, but then we got on the internet and she announced there was no point doing it until everyone is here, so we ended up just watching sex and the city whilst flicking through sale catalogues.  Don't think will get to go on holiday this year, we'll never get everyone in one place at the same time.  Gonna be pasty this year.

Exam tomorrow.  Should really be revising now.  I don't think i have the right attitude for someone who is about to sit their final exams.  Do find subjects fairly interesting, so not finding it too hard to remember stuff, think will be ok, just want to get it over with."

"event","I thought i'd finished my animation, but came across my budget form, which clearly states on the first page: 'Please complete actual costs and hand in with your production dossier'.  I hate maths.  Bastards.

Jim finally emailed me a copy of the script.  But since have spent all day revising will give my brain a rest then go through it against the storyboard.  Am planning on watching North by Northwest tonight as 'research'.  Tis research, how can I do the cinematography on a film noir without even having seen any film noir?  

Instead of going swimming last night, I saved my money and went for a run with Ash instead - a RUN!  ME!  Don't know how she convinced me so easily though.  Worked quite hard, as felt like such a potato running with Ash, and didn't want to look too unfit.  She said she didn't work as hard with me even though she was wearing ankle weights (which I gave to her, and encouraged her to wear them as I knew would never keep up with her otherwise) but she said that it encouraged her to pace herself better, rather than just sprint off an wear herself out so much she couldn't get home.  Was quite invigorating, but wouldn't go on my own, as would get lazy and end up walking back via the chip shop.

Am in a lot of pain today though. 

Musn't let myself go out tomorrow night.  Might go swimming, but other than that, am gonna have a nice early night so that I am well rested for my week of filming (although not actually filming tomorrow, am just going to do camera and lighting tests).  Ooh, so excited, I love doing film shoots.  I pretend its my real job."

"event","Hahaha, have finished animation dossier.  Just need to print out my stills then do an appendix page.  Will take 5 mins.  Can't print out stills til have photo paper though, so will just do appendix page for now, then just have to slot it in.

Will spend all day tomorrow revising.  Jim informed me that we are now finishing at 7pm everyday, rather than 5.30 on his film shoot.  So by the time I get home its 8pm, then allowing an hour for dinner and various faffing, it is then 9pm, and I'll probably want to go to bed by 10.30pm.  An hour an a half of revision everyday, if I'm being optimistic.  Hopefully, this shoot won't be as emotionally draining as my last one did, cos a)using video instead of film and b)my degree isn't depending on its success. But still, best get good start on revision, as will have only a week between the shoot and my exam. 

Manu bought me a carrot cake today.  He's such a sweetie pie.

Don't know whether to go masters training tonight.  Know I should go, and I will enjoy it when I get there....yes, I will.  Even though missing the first 15 mins of Desperate Housewives is a very good reason to stay at home, my protruding beer gut is a better reason to go. 

And have finished my animation.  Will reward myself with some trashy tv for an hour, then will make up for laziness by hardcore swimming for an hour."

"event","Last night was very good, even when they played boring stuff, it was no where near as crap as the stuff they usually play.  And the dj actually knew how to dj, mixing them properly rather than just playing one shitty song after another.

Really sleepy now though.  And when my mother woke me up at 8.15am to tell me to make sure that I get up 5 mins earlier to hang out the washing, I realised that I may not be able to cope living at home for very long.  Wanna move out but can't afford it, and need to find someone to live with.

I know sarah is looking for so0meone to houseshare with, but I wouldn't be able to cope living with her - it would probably end the friendship.  Poor Nat told her she would move in with her, but Nat actually meant she would think about it, whereas sarah took it as set in stone.  Now, after thinking about it, nat has to try and break it to her that she doesn't know if she will live with her or not.

meeting Jim in a few minutes, hopefully he has a script for me, and has booked out the camera to play with.  

Really hungry, but don't have any money on me to buy a sandwich :("

"event","Last night was very good - dj luck & mc neat were down the pris.  Told DJ Luck that I loved him and so he blew me a kiss, then pinched MC Neat's arse and told him that I had his Presents Kiss albums I, II & III.  He asked me if that was from gift vouchers and I said no, cheek, I bought them, thus putting money in his pocket.

Am sure I drank more water than alcohol, yet I didn't get up til after 11 and feel a bit hungover.  

Spose to be doing a whole day pub crawl monday, but not sure if its a good idea as a) have no money and b) really have to do some uni work.  Sarah wants us to finish at the pris (as is apparentyl open every bank holiday) and so I said how are we gonna get home, and she said ""well I'm staying at my mums, but you guys cant stay cos my mum isn't happy about me being there at the moment"".  So I suggested driving, which would also prevent me spending shit loads of money on drink, but then she said ""oh no, you can't drive on a whole day pub crawl!""  Well how the fuck am I spose to get home then?  I can't afford taxi all the way home; I could stay at Manu's but that means taking my car there in the morning then getting a bus back down to hythe.  I don't know if everyone else is going, but if its just me ash and sarah then I might say no, as Sarah was getting on my nerves last night, so a whole day with just her might be a bad idea.

As I said, uni work really isn't happening, really have to do my animation dossier, but just cant be arsed.  Will definetly go into uni next week and do some work in the library.  Have to go up there anyway to meet up with Jim to do some visual research and lighting tests for his film, but he hasn't been in touch with me for nearly 2 weeks now, so getting a bit annoyed.  I don't know how he expects me to understand the storyboard without knowing the script.  Also haven't used the camera before, as is a video camera and have been working on a film camera for the past two years.  Even though film cameras are harder, I'd actually feel more confident using one of those right now."

Michelle said that as I am moving out officially on friday, we are gonna have dinner as a house on thursday, then they are going to take me out for cocktails at the breeze bar (Michelle is obsessed with having cocktails), which I thought was very sweet.  Good thing am going home today cos haven't got any clothes suitable for having cocktails.

My friends are so useless at organising.  I came to synchro on sunday, and nat asked me if I was going to the cinema after synchro, and I was like, ""no, did you not think to text me to give me a bit of notice"" ""well I assumed Ash would see you"".  We may be sisters, and we may live in the same house (most of the time) but never assume we will see each other.  I'm sure Nat knows I work all day sundays anyway.  Then this morning, I get a text from Nat asking me who else is going to the pub quiz.  Apparently she didn't realise that I wasn't at the cinema on sunday when they arranged it.  Am going I think though, if I cn manage to persuade Manu to be sociable.  Am determined one day not to come last, or second to last in another bloody quiz.  

Am going to buy pretty shoes today to go with my party dress.  They are in a fantastic new shop called Quebe, so will be a dangerous quest, as I am being tempted into spending money that I don't have on beautiful shoes I don't need.  Just the one pair for today."

My car is falling apart.  Along with having just replaced my alternator, the central locking not working on the passenger side, and not having been able to open the boot for a year and a half, it has now decided it has a mystery leak.  And because it rained last night, I discovered that the steering wheel and drivers seat were soaking wet, and had to drive with a constant drip on my arms and legs.  But it hasn't dripped anywhere else!  Just the drivers side!  I wouldn't mind if it was the passenger side, I don't have to sit there!  Think am gonna have a toffee flapjack to cheer myself up.

Friday night was fan-tastic.  Got good and drunk, but not so much that I was sick.  Didn't have too many comments about my shirt, except, ""why are you called Lady Shrek?"".  Did get a few comments about my lacy fingerless gloves, particularly from one guy who thought his cowboy shirt was very fashionable and cool, and I informed him that it wasn't.

Synchro is getting me down at the moment.  Just want it to be over now, but have to stay just til beginning of june.  Feel bad for coaches cos we are being little madams at the moment, but am fed up.  Also have to tell synchro coach who is away with her new baby that we are leaving, especially as it leaked out to the rest of the club that we are leaving, so can just imagine the gossip between the bitchy mothers."

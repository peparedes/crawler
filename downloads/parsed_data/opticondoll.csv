well i am proud of myself considering how much i suck at math i passed my class with an 85, which to me is an outstanding accomplishment. yes if i tried harder i couldve done better but that was hard enough for me to move on. my final for that was pretty good, and well ill admit there were maybe 2 questions that had me stumped but of course i tried them anyway. i turned in my essay for adolescent psych and i felt real good about that. so i think things are looking up. 
I cant wait for winter and this break, i think it will do me some good to just relax and let go of a couple of my worries until next semster when ill be ready to take it head on again. 
well tomorrow is the last day of the semester. I got to go to work today 2-10 eww. yeah .. i kinda hate sheetz but i dont becuase it pays good for me to pay off the shit i got myself into.

"event","i like this song alot. i think that we are all obsessed with feelings. the depressed are obsesssed with saness and well depression. the hopeless romanics are obsessed with the depressed love stories or love in general. The gamers and adventurers are obsessed with fun and excitement. I think who we are and what we do is all based on the core obsesion of a certain emotion or feeling we love to feel or experience. the sex adicts areobsessed with lust and passion. Im not saying none of the other sterotypical people listed cant feel that, its just the obsession thats the difference. We can all like to have fun, excitment, love, etc. and we all feel pain. lol unless your me. i think im a love-obsessed, passionate adventurer, hopeless romatnic. But my favorite type of movioe is a horro flick. i like blood. But I LOVE, love? whys that make me feel like a sappy, weak, girly-girl? I still like gothicism. i woulnt say i am a goth. but i love dark colors, and i empathize sadness, depression and the empty, lost- my life sux people. but i think that those are the emo's? right they are kinda pathetic in my opinion. every type of music is emotional. whether about love, pain, happiness. etc. its an emotion. screw the fucking emos to steal such a typcial name for ""their"" music genre. it should be titled whiney rock. but im a hypocrite cuz i listen to the used, thursday, matchbook romance, yada yada. oh well. anyway. i think i fall for GOOD love stories over sappy gay oh oh-ness ones. But nothing of course beats a horror-movie, except touristas. that had beautiful scenery, thats about it. it was pretty.. bland and uhh okAY?? wtf. it didnt have good character development. i think the coolest part of the movie was when they were on the beach, drinking and dancing and their drinks had been drugged and everything was looking neonish psycadellic. and star-struckish. it had that delusional gaze- like some LSD shit was going on. that was some of the coolest camera tricks i think technology invented. 

so anyway back to that. i read my other Lj's and realized in sparratic, my mind jumps topics like frogs on lillypads. and then i cant go back and remember the order of the pads i jumped to get where im at. im chasing that topic or (fly) and get so destracted by the other bugs, my mind JUMPS. 
Love isnt my favorite feeling i dont think but i know its at least the 2nd. thats probably why im so obssesed with talking about mine and rob's story and trying to figure us out and analyzing our situation and get so worked up over it and then when i have feelings for someone else i get so oh my god what do i do? becuase it really takes a lot for me to like someone, not based on looks, but its 3 things besides looks- if u meet these 3 then your looks dont matter. Eccentric, interesting persoanlity, a good- goal setted mind, and fun, gentlemanish, nice but arrogant and confidence with a the fear and weakness of depression. looks after that are a plus. oh i like guys with hobbies. wtf why am i writing this in here. maybe.... i dont want rob.. guh yes i do, stfu angela. maybe i want rob cuz hes the NOT-A-KEEPER type of guy but can be soo sentimental and have that strenght of confidence. ew stop talking. im such a cornball. i hate it. i think myu def no.1 is I AM a goth. Im obsessed with peoples sadness, dark- scary shit. i love HALLOWEEN. my faviorite fucking holiday. if i was obsessed with love my holiday should be Valentines days. But no IM A FREAK. maybe not a freaky as some people but definalty strange or odd. no, im not a freak, i just LOVE SCARY stuff ^_^. i.e horror films or even fanshionable druggie raving bloody movies with a twisting plot and defined character development. i.e Party monster. i have yet to own that fucking movie, ooo oo x-mas gift for me! *hint*hint* anyway.. 
i like this song cuz im a sap. 

you say i only hear what i want to. 
you say i talk so all the time so. 

and i thought what i felt was simple, 
and i thought that i don't belong, 
and now that i am leaving, 
now i know that i did something wrong 'cause i missed you. 
yeah, i missed you. 

and you say i only hear what i want to: 
i don't listen hard, 
i don't pay attention to the distance that you're running 
or to anyone, anywhere, 
i don't understand if you really care, 
i'm only hearing negative: no, no, no. 

so i turned the radio on, i turned the radio up, 
and this woman was singing my song: 
the lover's in love, and the other's run away, 
the lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay. 

some of us hover when we weep for the other who was 
dying since the day they were born. 
well, this is not that: 
i think that i'm throwing, but i'm thrown. 

and i thought I'd live forever, but now i'm not so sure. 

you try to tell me that i'm clever, 
but that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you. 

you said that i was naive, 
and i thought that i was strong. 
i thought, ""hey, i can leave, i can leave."" 
but now i know that i was wrong, 'cause i missed you. 

you said, ""i caught you 'cause i want you and one day i'll let you go."" 
""you try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just scared to lose. 
and you say, ""stay."" 

you say i only hear what i want to. 

need i say more about being obsessed with love, what chick doesnt really? i guess im not an average or well preppy cheerleader girl but we all fall head-over heels for love stories and ask ""so how are you and so-and-so?"" 
i think this is why i want to be a psychiatrist-ish type of person. im obsessed with peoples feelings and getting to the root of personalities and emotion and behaviors. i want to know why why why- why we are who weve become. and i want to write write and write about it all. and write reason and write stories i experience and explain in such defined detail and precison that someone would love it and want it to be known. i want to be a writer in my head, i want to write everything about everything, but in my heart i want to know why i want to write. my reason for why im a psych major. i want reason. and i want to write that reason, because theres somehting i know im cabable of writing and i want to write it and tell it to the world, and use analogy, synonyms, hikus, peotry, rhythem, lyrics, stories, everything about the world in all forms of writing. i want it to be detailed. i want it to be broad, so everyone cna relate one wya or another to whatever or anything i write about. 
im going to finished downloading music, cuz it seems what i have isnt good enough, or i dont have enough, or theres just not enough music. I love music. all kinds.. i hate country, period. its boring."

"event","so, im writing acutally cuz im bored. because at the moment im tired of everything else and i just feel like sitting on my ass and writing away about nothingness. no, im gonna write about how bored i feel and totally become a hypocrite to my last entry. So, and so, so i drove around today because i was bored- knowing i dont have a lot of money. i just got home from Rob house. its funny that we broke up, still tell people we are dating, we hang out just about everyday or any free chance we are convenient to each other, we still do everything we did and things are just abou the same when we did date. i guess the difference is.. i SHOULDNT feel guitly if i have feelings for somoene else... in which i kinda SORTA do..? i think. but i do feel guilty, because i love him. Im gonna write more on this bullshit.. so here we go.. <br />I love Rob, i do, we've done alot together than ive done with alot of the other people ive dated. 1 yr and almost 3 mos. will do that i guess and living only 5 mins from each other. in the same town.. going to FCC together and well i work at the local gas station. sometimes it sounds like our relationship is so movie like, parents hate and disagree their oldest daughters bf, she hides, lies and hangs out with him, but its so convenient. But then i feel like hes not trying, not going anywhere, and i feel bad cuz i know he wants to, but he has to put his life nad goals at a pause because of the mistake me made. plus he cant take back all this shit i put up with and things i shouldnt have taken him back for. I always feel like i can do better. thats where the problem is. the guy(s) i think im kinda sorta feeling these feelings, though maybe not, i feel are better than ME. But no, everyone should have a chance with anyone, that just doesnt seem fair. I feel like i blew my chance with someone i fell for and hes one of those people i still have feelings for. Secondly, the recent guy im kinda sorta feeling feelings for, we havent hung out in over a week, let alone spoke. I feel because i didnt show interest, he thought all i wanted was friendship but i didnt want to jump right into a relationship. Now, i feel so disappointed in Rob, i wanted him to try and try so hard for me, i feel like i should give up on him cuz i feel like he blew his chance for me. Its so hard for me to believe or trust him. It really is. Trust is the basis of a relationship and i feel like from now- on with anyone ""new"" that may come my way in life, ill have a hard time opening up and trusting right off the bat. <br />Rob and I had so much planned. We want to move out togehter in an apartment nearby for now, get Khloie a new pillow, go grocery shopping, furniture shopping, decorate and pay our bills together and argue lol. We do argue alot as of now. But i think without an argument, itd be dull and too perfect. I dont like perfection, its too prestine (sp?), too ""shiney"", too bllehh. I like to use doo-able, or acute as the ""fitting"" word. I want to erase all the bad in our past, but then i guess it would look perfect right? Id be an idiot to say Rob and I had and have a perfect ""relationship"". But what am i trying to get out. Am i bored? Am i lost? Confused? looking for someone else? what is it that feels is lagging? my faith or hope for the better of the ""Rob and Angie together forever""'s future? its so hard to let this go, but is that what i want? to let US go? it hurts, ive put everything i got, in my heart, mind and soul into our relationship, my hopes, my dreams have focused on US. it upsets me. i love the person i shouldnt be with ""says the world"" (friends, parents, sisters) but then everyone CAN be okay with him form time to time, excpet mom and dad, i need to .. no.. ehhh.......... i dont pray. I should maybe to my higher power. but i guess i kinda call out. not pray. i rant in my head asking for help with out pressing my hands together and getting on my knees before my bed for someone or something to straighten my life out. I just think, and ask in my own head, in MY way. everyone is unique right? dont argue with my ""praying"" style. I need to exercise, i watched Stick It, and now i want to get back into gymnastics. I want defined abs. not abs thats are only noticable when poked behind the pudding thickend on my abodomen when flexed. sigh. sigh. <br />i want school and finals to be over. i want the week to end. i want x-mas to be over and fast-forward to new years, pause have a drink. then fast-foward to tax-returns, get a new car, or something grand and hit play, and experience next semster right now. <br /><strong>i want snow. I want to go outside sit in the frozen thick slush, make an angel, and stare into a grey sky with the ashes of shaved flaked ice fall from the clouds and ponder more about, the whyness in this world and forget how cold it really is when the snow melted through my gloves, freezing my fingers and the cold burns my neck. Just forget all feelings, worries, upsetness, and my life in paticular for the moment. Think about the sky, the snow, life in general, life we all have and then think about how harmonizing nature is in balancing herself. its remarkable, so suttle, so everyday, but still doo-able. acute. real. i think i want adventure. <br />I want somehting amazing to happen to me. i want success. i want everyone i know to be happy. with them, i want my family to be happy, i want al lthe money in the world to burn, or expire somehow. i hate money, its a disease. I wish people werent so mean, so conceited, arrogant, and rough, tough and powerful, were suposed to be equal. But thats why the weak must balance the powerful, the failures balance the leaders, the poor balances the rich, the scared balance the brave, etc, its all an equation. <br /></strong><em>Its balanced on a beam of equality within opposition.</em> We will all die after we are born. sooner or later, with beginnings there comes ends. What is love? why must the feeling be so grand? overrated? tampered with? flawed? BLIND? i wish i was crazy. sometimes. id love to be a delusionist. lol. well im really uber tired. i think im done with my random ramble of the day. the average human spends 1/3 of their life sleeping, whether they admit it or not. its impossible to function without recharging. i think i need to catch up to that ratio, because im drained.."

"event","So, my birthday has passed. And i know i havent updated. ive been busy with studing for finals, working (the usual), final projects, homework, and figuring out what im going to take next semester and realizing how long its going to take me just to get my fucking associates. Well as a psych major, we can figure the logical most factual way to solve and PREDICT a solution to this problem. I am not going to quit sheetz, i WANT... wait i I NEED to MOVE THE FUCK OUT. lol wow.. i wonder how many entries have this line in it. Ew. Christmas is coming. ok end of that subj. SO i am looking into getting a job with NIHM. yes, i said NIHM, does the ""Secret of NIHM"" ring a bell to anyone. great movie, havent seen it go watch it. we talked about NIHM in my adolescent psych class and i was just sooooo uberly intruiged by their methods and their goal for patients that i was like MAN, that i think is the aim for my degree. i want to be a psychological scientist. i am going to give drugs to rats, to make sure the fucked-up humans aren't being mislead by their prescibed medication :-). This seems boring i know. I do wish i could have followed  something more ARTSY. I am an artistic person. I miss that side of me. I feel like im becoming neutral, boring, bland, plain-jane. But no im still here, its in me. Nothing will stop my from dyeing myt hair. It is now VAMPIRE RED. Yes very very blood red. I think if i were u, id do me with this hair color, i love it cuz i remind myself of Lucy from ELFEN LIED, well it was pink before which is her actual haircolor. I still do my make-up every-morning and nite. I love poetry just as much as i used to and i miss writing, i was never the best or runner up but i love expression of vision in writing. And experiences, thoughts, and ideas or dreams. I feel kind of hopeless but there i know is a list inside of me wiating to discover more in The top 20 things i must do before i die: I realized the other day i was discussing the topic of Christianity with my friend Andrew, and how he said ""oh i used to be an Agnostic"", after i had described my beliefs on religion and yadda yadda. Anyway this relates to my point because I AM neutral. I HAVE OPINIONS, I AM NOT BORING. I believe there is a HIGHER POWER (that doesnt mean ""he"" is called GOD) but look around us. Somebody or something made the nature, the earth, the scenery, the life we are living. But why do I need to follow these ""rules"" in a book? No, i dont, i refuse to be a slave to a religion having other people tell me how to live my life because thats what their higher power says to do. End of that. I want experience, I want to love the life i was given and show who i am everything life has to offer me. Doing nothing has to be the stupidest thing, its a waste. I dont have time to complain anymore about how shitty work was, or how hard and frustrating that last exam was or how much my parents hate Rob, or my manager giving me shit about my hair. I can worry about these ""Things"" so insignificant to the beauty of the spirit within this body. WOW >_< uh that sounded corney, scratch that.. But thats my point. 

I Finally can say that I am happy with WHO I AM. What i have the opportunity to do, what i am capable of doing, the potential, the future, the life i have to make in front of me. Theres a long road and i REALIZE that i need to follow it in the right direction, whether close- far, long, narrow, next year or in a decade, i will make everyday unforgettable. I know i will get there, and there after. I want a colorful life, i want someone to want to read my book, and even color the front with every haircolor- color ive worn. I want my life to be happy, pretty, exciting, and fun-filled. I want to do somehting about this person i am in. I want to be somebody i like, worth mentioning, if i dont become famous, at least i liked myself. Its strange how happiness comes in the ""depressing months"" it has been pretty hard to make me angry the past 2 weeks. unless you really hurt me, my feelings and got my hopes up. But other than that, I am Angela, I have over-come my depression and i know what i WANT in my life. I want to be successful. I am so Happy. I still have that absence in my mind- that lingering failure feeling but i will not let that get me down, i feel so positive about everything that I had to write abou tthis. I am not much of a writer but i do want a write a book one day, maybe someONE will read it, maybe ONE million will read it. But its worth the shot. Put my life on the lines in the pages, its one of those Top 20 things to accomplish before i die. Once i die, theres no going back, i need to be happy with what ive done, and i need to start that life to fill in the pages of this book, now."

"event","hello there. i havent written in awhile.
i feel kinda bored with life. i dunno why but if you happen to be in my life dont take this personally. i guess since i am studing psych id understand that adolescents go through this as a usual process.. so im not gonna try to figure myself out.
im thinking of getting a new car. i am bored with mine and well... i want it to be my own. and i want something new. that doesnt mean i want new people if u happen to be someone that thinks they need to be replaced in my life.. you are not. i am seeming very nonchalant about everything lately. work. school. family. friends. life in general. i am tired of trying to figure out why so maybe i think that just laying low with my feelings till they subside or come to some sort of agreement along the way i will just not care to share or talk about them.
i want to move out so bad. the effect of this may mean though that i wont have money to save for college and continue my goals in becoming somebody in the life after high school. i am sick of my ""home"" as much as i write this statment in my journals i will not stress this subject any longer. period. i want to be independant. i need a college loan, but this interfears with wanting a car loan. 
the question is what the hell should i do? but of course in the end this will end up being my choice. 
but lets say i get a new car, i move out, and i can go to college full-time. there still seems to be somehitng missing.. oh yeah the boyfriend.
you dont have to read this but i am writing this because i have analyzed our relationship logically and i understand better than anyone where he is coming from but the question is, where will we go? that will all depend again on choices made.
Rob- goes to school part time like me, he has a paid off car, but is in debt. but that is okay he will be free within the next 6 mos. or so (give or take) hes made new friends, and became more mature about his choice of friends and is finally decided to do somehting constructive (go to school) and has a job that pays better and i htink that he actually likes. so is rob better off than me? yes.. to an extent. the problem? 
well we are different as different can be. i am a morbid, messed up individual at times but i can be social if i want and i take life seriously(not too seriosuly) but i dont like people too much, i pretent to care, and sometimes carry on to seem sort of human. lol. well ha, and well i want a better job, but i like the job i have. it pays good. close to home. and i work with friends. i dunno there it goes back to being bored since ive been there for 2 1/2 years. ehh anyway. it seems that rob is one of those ""i need to get out people"" and i get taht he is a saggitarius just as i am. we crave adventure (hence my bordum. but are we bored with each other? we do very much love each other and can see each other pretty much whenever we want to. maybe that is the problem. but if i am away for even 2 days of not seeing him i feel distant and these feelings of ""letting go"" tend to occur. he feels that we may end up mutually splitting up like we just cant deal with each other. me being nonsocial with strict parents not playing pool, bowling etc. even though ive never done either just dont have the interest to, and the fact that i am just an overall closed person irritates him. He- is obnoxious, somtimes immature, and LOUD. like wtf loud sometimes. like i said we are 2 too different people. how can we handle.. opposites attracting psychologically is incorrect. at first it is interesting but we will GET TIRED of each others behavioral patterns and persona in the lond run. is there anything that can save this relationship? not if u believe that people should change for someone else. so no that wont happen. we either deal. or dump. lol funny way to put that but well not really.
Neither of us understand why we are together. some people say we arent meant to be. but which is it. why would it hurt either of us soo much to unbearable measures if we decided to not be together? it seems simple but this situation is NOT. let alone the fact his paretns love me. mine hate him (passionately i might add). so this is my daily forcast. i am rained on with problems ago and well tomorrow is just another day of puppy appointments and working and homework and drama possibly? lets hope the meteorologist is incorrect. 
i dunno what to do but im sure life will figure out what i need to do. or what we need to do. thats the best positive note i can give myself otehr than to not think of it which however may lead to communicational issues.. ::sigh:: isn't life wonderful."

Like a cut broke i open:
Sore, Swollen, Infected... like a disease,
I can taste this fearful future, a threatening past, and an unsure present
This is what is has become- this is where it all leads..
Grasping my arm to stop the pain
from running through my veins
It's moving rapidly in my direction
crowding me with confrontations
and confusing situations
She: Gave it all up; Takes it all in-
With her heavy heart- 
Stolen only by one- her one and only- hidden in secracy
I: Protected her fragile beats and carried them safely away
Away from the rest of the world, who disagrees
with where it is she longs to be-
I carry her to you; one and only
You are all she ever longs for
She beats; pulsates for you-
Slowly, rapidly, calmly-
Like a rushing river, quiet lake;
craddled braches swaying in the arms of the wind
A Sweet Embrace
place her at ease from the rest of the world- 
Full of arguments and complaining
make her safe; like you used to- make yourself the safest place-
She'll ever rest her head upon
She is lost without you, Scared; Worried; Scarred; 
Hold her close to keep hidden; enclose your arms around-
Never to let go, not for anything, not for anyone
Don't break her, Don't let her skip a beat, Don't loose her
Shatter the existance of pain within her soul
Caress her gently, Let all be okay once again
Save her from complication
Carry her; One and only- Your one and only
To a safer Destination with 
A Sweet Embrace"

this an upset me, please dont take me seriosuly, but then again do- i wish i knew what to do with me and ROb even though i suggested this stupid break, why is he okay and im not.. i can even deal with my own advice. but i cant help but always think hes lieing to me... my god i need a psychiatrist.... i need to be shrinked. i feel like im going to die.. 
oh i might end up at sheetz forever.. ive just been offered a management position finally ^_^.. god i wish i knew what i really wanna be. i feel like i dont care what it is, as long as i can do it, its not too challenging.. and i make lots of money. i think then ill be happy.. i wanna move out.. i hate this place, but how can i save to move out if im always broke???

i feel so damn addicted, like i can never get enough of seeing and being with him, but i know too much of a good thing one way or anohter is bad for u right?. but i dunno. ill find out the consequences when one comes along. i havent been so happy in such a long time. its jsut different to say that im in a relationship or that im dating, i have a boyfreind. it feels almsot new. but its old-new news. does that make sense? I love it! i really do. i guess i cant express my happiness so well in front of others cuz i wanna keep it to myself. but i can when im alone with him, so that we can share it together. ok, i guess im donwe with the mushy stuff. people are prolly like ew gawd shut up angela.. u suck u pansy ass cornball, eh oh well, if u cared ud be happy so  sew me for having a happy feeling and for being in love. o well. im happy. ^_^"

"event","like eww, i hate my layout for this journal, its way tooo colorful and its giving me a headache. ok lets get the basics over, prom was done, im graduated, im still working at sheetz, iv got my classes only on Mondays and Wednesdays from like 12:15-7:30pm though, there all together in between is like 3 hours of break. ive got my new car (the cougar) and its mid july, sorta. my summer i guess was ok so far, ive gone to six flags, im GOING to go to Ocean City this weekend, i went to late parties, ive gotten high, my mom lets me smoke now, ive drank, ive gone to annapolis/glen burnie(i wanna go back sometime before school starts), ive watched TONS of movies, i went to Nj that was like back in may, the graduation party went better than i planned it would, i got to know alot out my family and i hung out wiht alyssa (22) and sar (31)- shes a bartender!, at Denny's and we just talked alot, even though it was months ago it felt like yesterday. 
well the other thing ive experienced this summer was, i think i feel in love. yeah, omg love? whoddathunk? but no, ive known this person for about a year now, and well we are pretty good friends, and i just get so nervious, anxious, excited, and like that feeling where your heart is racing but your still in this dazed calm state-of-mind. well, it seems like maybe he likes me too, but hes got things he needs to deal with and well i reallly really wanna be there for him and i want to help him out so badly, but how can i help the person im in love with, if they dont tell me what it is or how i can help? i understand its somehting private and something that should be left unsaid, just i dunno waht im trying to say, i just wish i was useful somehow. i love being his friend, and i hope it stays that way. i just wanted somehting a little more, i can wait, im not in a hurry, u can't rush somehting like that. because before i started to develope these feelings, i didn't care much for anyone else like that, cuz ive had my heart broken more than once, ive been shut down plenty of times, i just hope that this is something mutual, notjust me falling for someone else an ending up lost again. something about him is different, it makes me feel safe, and wanted, and its just exciting to be around him. i wish i could put my finger on the words but thats as close as i can come to them.
i guess ill start writing in here again, cuz it seems like ive got more to say. oh yeah, im going to see NIN on nov. 2nd (YESSS!). this will be so much fun, considering hes one of the other 3 people im going with. well if that person happens to read this, i guess by now, he already knows, i jsut wnated to put my feelings somewhere, where i can get them out. any maybe if anyone wanted something to say about, then can go ahead and do so."

"event","ook, so today i asked the person that ive been wanting to ask to prom, and the whole reason i didnt want to go with jon to prom was jsut to get his answer (jon either way i knew wouldnt of gone anywya) but yeah that guy (who shall ramain unmentioned) said he really didnt wanna go and lol isnt going with me cuz of work and everything else. lol i feel sooo stupid. thats not the first time ive been let down, but gah i feel like an idiot, i was gonna ask him sunday (the day we were gonn see a movie but he couldnt cuz of other plans) oook thats why i asked tonight and id figured id ask to stop slacking and finally get an answer. but man i seriously wanted to go with him, not for the sake of jsut having a date but becasue of the fact that i liekd him more than i wish i would, but i doubt he sees me like that. i dunno if he even cares for girls now as far as a girlfriends or even maybe as dates. but im totally cool with it. i myself dont even know im up for that stuff. ok well i am but i understand. i hate asking, i know its the 21st century and it doesnt matter, but when a girl askes and gets rejected, holy shit its embarassing.
so i guess sonce he said no, id rather not go with anyone, becuase i like him, id feel awkward going with anyone else except pat cuz he has a gf, and we are jsut good freinds liek that, but i doubt hed go. so i'll jsut go for my friends. ehh, i dunno anymore. sometimes i hate guys, like gah i feel like i cant get anyone. like theres seriosuly something wrong with me that attracts guys i dont like, and the ones i do liek just dont see me in ways i wish they could. but what the hell is it. not that i care for it now, but i hate admiting the fact taht i wish i had ""someone"". not for jsut that fact i can call them my boyfriend, but because i liekd that person. i hate how things end up that way with me. cuz im an idiot. 

i worked 2-10 today, well 4-6 at the rosmont sheetz. its really different in there, compared to ours, i liek our layout better its more understanding and easier and organized and everythign else jsut makes it better.

"event","gah im soo sick and tired of men. i swear like what is wrong with them, there is worng iwth everyone i meet.. yes i know there is no perfect person out there, let alone me. but i really really wanna date someone, yet i dont. and whenever i try to open up to someone, it turns out the wrong way or like they play me, they have serious problems, they gahh its jsut soo fuckign aggrivating, i cant find anyone decent, im not in a very talkative mood eighter right now. im being soo bitchy cuz i really want someone to rely on, someone that cares for me, and not some freak obssessed person eighter. jsut someone basically looking for the same thing i am. soemtimes i htink i foudn that person but its not. its just not. my head is really hurting right now and i feel liek screaming. god.. i dont wanna make this about me eighter, but im sick of the descrimination against descrimination, sometimes it irks me to the point where i wish i wasnt asian. it pisses me off that people think that minority are ruling against your typical white male, usually i dont care, honestly i still dont but i dont like hearing anymore about this crap, cuz tehre is still racism and sexists and all kinda of judgmental crap out there. this phase may pass me in a few hours or days whatever but it will, i just got the stupid urge to go all rant raving and emotinal. 
BUT!!! 
on the other hand today is (was) samanthas 18th birthday.. yes folks porno and cigarettes!! lol hehe.. ok so maybe there is someone i liek at the moment but im soo scared to like him because hes one of the ""populars"" and kinda arrogants at school cuz of who he is. but i dotn wannna get my hopes up in likeing him. hes not even attractive which is what surprises me, but that doesnt matter.. i like him just cuz. but meh.. whatever, ill always have a stupid little crush on someone..
now im talking to sam online.. maybe she'll make me feel better because sehs my best friend. 
ok well then, second thoughts lol.. prom is a definate i dunno, since jon decided to ditch our""day the hangout"" :/ .. bah wtf. prom is seeming more and more less meaningfull than it was to me. im only going now, if i go for sam's sake cuz she got a dress.. which means in either case im getting a dress.
BUT for sams birthday
well i got her a dragonfly ballon lol it  was uberly colorful and some purple flowers. she had a nice birthday which makes me happy that one of us is happy. 
i bumped into joey at the mall, in which i got osme pants, another cheshire cat shirt, orange julius some wierd keychains from spencers, uh a black hot topic suportive bracelet. and i rented pokemon and a movie with kate winslet in it (heavenly creatures) still need to watch them
moms at work.. im bored, tired and really really lonely.. :-( 
i hate that. i mean i dont even want a relationship right now jsut for sex if thats what people are thinking that im lonely for, jsut want somoene to call my boyfirend. sex is fun great and all but not top priority. 
ok im gonna stop complaing and jsut frekaing deal with my crap.

"event","well i guess i unboreded myself realy fast since myt last entry cuz me and Samantha cuaght the 9:35 pm showing of the Ring 2, iactually kinda liked it believe it or not, it was cute mother son, and Samara having to be sent back. well lol ok maybe not so cute but ehh o well.. anyways it was odd the part where the deers come in and ram her car.. we were bored so we just decided to drive around frederick cuz nothing open after 11:30pm lol. and out of nowhere theres this little baby dear man jsut right there in the road, that would be my sencond encounter with a dear on the road (me as the driver that is)it was just soooo odd! it was cute i tried to talk to it but it ran away but ehh who wouldnt run away from a freak that cant speak your own language lol. uhmm hmm it is raining and my shift turned out to be 10-4 for tomorrow. so 6 hours yay! LOL jk.. o well ill have a 34 hours week which is cool. 
well we stopped by my work i talked to mom and i finally got my posters with the milkshakes and my mocha frappuccino so i have a big coffee drink on my wall now which is awesome!! lol i gave my sisters the other ones cuz they're not as important to me so they can have something odd on their walls lol. well my legs dont itch anymore.. im prolly not gonna be able to run tomorrow anyways cuz its raining... id dance in the ran but ehh not run plus i got to be at work iun like 9 hours soo lol need the sleep O_o!
well after i dropped sam off a black cat didnt exactly cross my path but i saw it just turn around the corner off the street before i could even see it on the road to ""cross my path"" soo i just made it out of luck for that superstition. hmm i should go to bed no i guess. i liek it outside it like nice and raining but like really sprinkleing so its beautiful. 
well yeah me and sam did start tlaking about other peoples lives and how unhappy many are, it is Hs and college and were about to be free out on our own, own decisions, and figuring ourselves out.. i wish people could be a little more happier.. im not saying im the happiest person in the world as clementine would say "" im just a fucked up girl looking for my own peice of mind"" "" i dont need to be it and i dont need anyone to be it at me"" i'll admit i have my days, but im still ok. it'd be nice to have someone to call my own, but its just not meant to happen for me right now, it jsut doesnt feel right with the people that wanna be with me (such as my stalker) lol yes i have a stalker he lives in brunsick but he backed off after i told him im a lesbian and that i dont believe in god lol, well i didnt really tell him that i told him im not lookign for anyone cuz he seems like one of those self centered moody and ium trying to be a good boyfreind kinda guys.. ehh i dont wanan put up with that crap. i just wnat someone looking for the same thing i am, looking for their own peice of mine, respectful to me, but not overly sensitive i cant stand that crap, i get emotional but im not goona go all out and weep and cry liek that. its pathetic. i jsut want someone who's casual and outgoing, ugh nevermind this doesnt matter. i dont know half of what i want anymore. so o well lol. just erg my perfect person is out there. everyones gotta have somoene for them, somtimes i wish i knew. but then that would ruin half the fun of figuring them out. ehh screw that ive got other things to worry about.. ok well im off to write out my love i wish knew i existed."

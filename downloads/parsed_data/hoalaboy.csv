"event","well im watching a music video by the certain band called ""oasis"" and when you look enough you see thousands of young men and wemon. and it struck me at that moment. if oasis was to tell them to do somthing like take down the government then most of them would then others would follow. theres an army of 500,000 young adults that could take orders. and whats funny is that they are civilians. as long as nobody died then they could succeed in taking over the government or other countries. wow. just to think about it is horrific."

"event","The Punctuality of a bee..............


well i have just found out that i myself am insane. yes yes i know but dont say it. also about 3 weeks ago i got hit by a truck, it hurt i still havent recovered and i dont know what to do. well the thought of the punctuality of a bee came into place. i dont know why. what would happen to a bee if it was late? is a bee ever late? do bees know about time? if the bees are late then what happens to them? then the other question comes into place. is a bee early? what would happen to the bee if it was early? if it is ealry then would it get rewarded? or punished? then the other question came into place. is a giraffe ever late? do giraffes have strict punctuality rules? what would happen if the giraffe it was on time? well these thoughts have proven that im insane. now another question comes into place, since im insane. what would happen if i was late? what would happen if i was early? would i get punished? do i even think about punctuality? no but i do think about bees stinging giraffes. but then the other question came into place. what would happen if the bee was late to sting the giraffe? would it die later? or earlier? but then the other question comes into place. what would happen if a snail was late? are they always late because of their slow locomotive motion? or perhaps are they early for the next day? then this next question comes into place. what if doogie houser was late? would he get stung by the bee? but what if the bee was late to sting doogie? what if a Tasmanian tiger was still alive? i like tasmanian tigers. they make me feel happy, have you ever seen a tasmanian tiger? arent tasmanian tigers extinct? what if a bee stung a tasmanian tiger? what if the giraffe was early to eat me but i was late? these you must ponder on your own time."

"event","i find it ver interesting that people tell me to be serious yet when it comes the time when i am serious they are not. when i am tlkaing with people, my friends most of which are girls they say how they are ""pirate hookers"" and how they are men. i find it ironic how they tell me to be serious and hate it when i make a stupid little joke but when it comes the time that i am, they are hipocritical. they are somthing that they arent, and that doesnt anger me it just puts me in a mood to where i am serious(for once). i am also trying to correct myself. but this has been on my mind. heres an example: a guy that nobody likes just hes a total jackass and nobody likes him. so in order to make him feel bad or piss him off. the people say such things as ""you dont have a penis"" or ""go to your gay father and cry"". now when u look at these this is a great example of the immaturity of mankind and how they cant except somthing that is there so that they can make themselves happy. of course we know that the boy has a penis and does not have a gay father because if he did then how would he be born? this is just showing how immature and stupid the world can be."

"event","Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"" 'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door;
Only this, and nothing more.""


Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,.
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,
Nameless here forevermore.


And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me---filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
"" 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
This it is, and nothing more.""


Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you."" Here I opened wide the door;---
Darkness there, and nothing more.


Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,
Lenore?, This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word,
""Lenore!"" Merely this, and nothing more.


Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before,
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely, that is something at my window lattice.
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore.
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.
"" 'Tis the wind, and nothing more.""


Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door.
Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.


Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore.
Tell me what the lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore.""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as ""Nevermore.""


But the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered;
Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before;
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""
Then the bird said, ""Nevermore.""


Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore,---
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ""Never---nevermore.""


But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore --
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
                                       Meant in croaking ""Nevermore."" 

Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore!


Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath
Sent thee respite---respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, O quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore!""


""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
On this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore:
Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me I implore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore---
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting--
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""


And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming.
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted---nevermore!


this is by most the best poem in the world"

"event","<br /><p>I'm cross posting this everywhere, so I'm sorry if you see it a few times! If you live outside of Nebraska, please disregard the blurb about hosting a show, unless you would like to do a catalog show!</p><p>~~~<br />&nbsp;<br />As most of you know, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I had very good intentions to plan an awesome Pampered Chef fundraising party at my house and just didn't get time to plan it for October! However, we still have a little bit of time before October is over, so I'm having a Help Whip Cancer ONLINE fundraiser. Pampered Chef will donate up to 25% of the sales to The American Cancer Society. In addition to that, they will donate and extra $3 for every booking from the fundraiser. For those of you who have been interested in having a party but just aren't sure when, NOW is the time to book! On top of what Pampered Chef is giving ACS, I am also donating my commission check from the show. The whole thing!<br />&nbsp;<br />To view the Pampered Chef catalog online, please go to <a href=""http://www.pamperedchef.biz/emily"">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/emily</a>. Click on the picture that says &quot;Order Products&quot;. Put my name in as the host (Emily Riggle, no I haven't changed my name yet..) before you start browsing. Make sure to put my first and last name in the two seperate fields, otherwise it won't find me! The next step is the fun part - go shopping for a good cause!<br />&nbsp;<br />When you are finished ordering: those of you in Nebraska may choose 'ship to the host' as your choice and I will deliver your products when they arrive. If you live outside of Nebraska, or would like your items shipped directly to your house, please choose direct shipping. This is a few extra dollars. <br />&nbsp;<br />Some bad news: unfortunately, we're not able to order the Help Whip Cancer PINK items and outlet specials through shows. If you are interested in either section of the site, you will need to place an individual order and it will be directly shipped to you (these sections don't show up if you've chosen to order through the fundraiser). This is the first time our pink items have been available online and not in May, but we're hoping it's such a success that they will make the pink items available at shows every October!<br />&nbsp;<br />PLEASE let me know if you have any questions or would like to book a show!! I'll be turning in orders at 10pm on October 31st, so please let me know before then!<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks for your support of the American Cancer Society. Have a happy Halloween!<br /><a href=""mailto:ekriggle@hotmail.com"">ekriggle@hotmail.com</a><br /><a href=""http://www.pamperedchef.biz/emily"">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/emily</a><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","we're home. we left arkansas this morning at 7, instead of the planned 9am. katrina woke up at 4:30 am and we decided it would be better to just get on the road instead of trying to get more sleep. she fell asleep north of bella vista and didn't wake up until we stopped for gas and driver switching in kansas city.

we had lots of fun with clay's dad and step mom. we went down for cindy's birthday party and it was great - lots of her friends and co-workers, lots of good food, lots of time out on the patio. katrina had lots of fun splashing in their pond and fountains. she looks like she has chicken pox from all the mosquito bites, dispite lathering her in bug spray. the portable dvd player is both a blessing and a curse - it helps us get through the trip, but she's addicted to movies right now and can't seem to entertain herself now that we're home. she crawled out of the portable crib twice last night. i guess we've been lucky she's last this long. time to convert her crib to a toddler bed - but we have to figure out what to do with the wrong colored rail we bought at NFM. ugh.

it was good to get out of lincoln for a few days, and it's good to be home. i got an awesome shot of katrina in the car this morning right after she fell asleep - i'll post it soon."

The last 3 hours of our trips always suck. Her poor butt was all red last time I changed her diaper from sitting in her seat for so long (not from sitting in a wet diaper&nbsp;- we've been stopping to change her every 2 hours which is more often than I change her at home) :) 6 minutes left! wee.. maybe i should find another game just in case."

I think whenever I'm done doing PartyLite (I don't know when that'll be), I'm going to give away or sell most of the stuff I have. They have a few pieces that come in the starter kit that I'm&nbsp;just not a fan of and would never put up in our house, but they're popular items, so it's good to have them at shows. 

I need to branch out into a new crowd of clients, but it's really hard to do when I haven't had anybody book shows off of my original ones. I know exactly why people haven't. I don't have a lot of experience in sales, so obviously, I'm pretty bad at it, so, who would want me to come into their home and do&nbsp;a lousy job? I'm learning as I go, though. But then I can't learn if I don't have more shows. :) 

I don't think I'll be doing this for much longer. Just a few more months, so that I can get the things I want, and get some christmas presents. I don't know. I need to make small goals. That's what helped me get through the first month. I need to do that again."

Well, it appears our African-American friends have found yet something else to be pissed about. 
 
A black congresswoman reportedly complained that the names of hurricanes are all Caucasian sounding names. She would prefer some names that reflect African-American culture such as Chamiqua, Tanisha, Woeisha, Shaqueal, and Jamal. She would also like the weather reports to be broadcast in language that street people can understand. I can hear it now: A weatherman in Houston says... 

""Wazzup, Mutha-fukkas! Hehr-i-cane Chamiqua be headin' fo' yo ass like Leroy on a crotch rocket! Bitch be a category fo'! So grab yo' chirren, yo' Ho, leave yo crib, and head fo' de nearest guv'ment office fo yo FREE shit!"""

One of the guest specials is 2 dozen votives for $8 (the spring/summer scents plus 5 other scents) with a qualifying order. If you bring a friend, you will get a free gift (probably a votive, I've no idea though)! the yummy fruit scents from previous years are only available until 7/31, so if you're jonesing for watermelon, kiwi strawberry, grape, lemongrass, or orange sherbet, come to the party! If you're not able to make it, but would like to see a catalog, I have a few extras that I can bring by. Kelly (the Partylite consultant) will also have the holiday catalog at the party, if you'd like to do some early holiday shopping.


I'll have the usual munchies and drinks, and I'll pop in a movie for anybody who would like to stay after the party. 

So bring your kids, sisters, moms, aunts, friends, or pass this on to anybody you think would like to come."

That didn't register in my brain at all. Everything's fine until..... I go to a movie this afternoon with a couple friends. Clay called while I was on my way home and said Katrina had been crying for 2 hours. I got home and she was kinda sweaty and pretty cranky. We thought maybe she was teething or something.. checked her temp, 100.1F. *Almost* high enough to ""OMG CALL THE DOCTOR"" but not quite. I gave her some tylenol, Clay made her a fresh bottle, I put a cold wet washcloth on her head, and that calmed her down. I went to friend's house (with the sick son) tonight because she was having people over.. her son had a temp of over 102 degrees today. GREAT. So Katrina got whatever he has, and I feel like I'm coming down with something too. She was pretty cranky all night but yay Tylenol, when it kicked in she was out like a light. I <3 Tylenol - oh, and the infant stuff smells really good.. I want to take it for my headaches cuz I bet it tastes yummy. :D

2) Came home from friend's house, and found an empty Tums bottle on the love seat, with the lid chewed up. Hmm, brand new bottle from a week ago, minus 4 Tums, chewed up bottle equals...puppies eating Tums merrily while daddy is sleeping. So I'm staying up with them to make sure THEY DON'T DIE. FUCKERS.

and, 3) The National Animal Poison Control Center costs THIRTY FUCKING DOLLARS to call and ask if something is poisonous. FUCK YOU, NAPCC."

It was a 2 hour ordeal, and just for being there (not counting the separate bill for the doctor and prescriptions), it was $700. Luckily, we only owe $93. I can't wait to get the bill for my 2-day stay - I'm guessing it's at least quadruple the ER bill. I hate the healthcare industry."

On this week's cover of Star Magazine (you can see a picture of it on the right side of the website), there's a picture of Jennifer Aniston with the caption: ""Is Jen pregnant <i>already?</i>"" The italics are theirs, not mine. Um... okay, so how far along is Angelina Jolie? Just about 8 months, if she's due early May. Um.... why the word <b>already</b> when Angelina's been pregnant for quite a while! If that caption should go to anyone, it's Angelina Jolie. She's been pregnant since before Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston's divorce was finalized. I hate celebrities. I hate tabloids, too."

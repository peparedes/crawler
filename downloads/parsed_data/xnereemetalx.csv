"event","Summer's awesome. I haven't even written in this thing-I've been so busy! I work like a Mexican in the summer...get home, do more work, then go to bed early. Then I have to get up early. I feel like such a loser haha. My brother is out everyday w/ friends and I work. But hey, it's good. I like my jobs. My kids at camp are awesome. They are so random. This kid comes up to me today with a big smile on his face and says, ""Hey! If I put some forks and knives in a blender, they would shoot like a gun!"" wow. I probably should have discouraged such an idea, 'cause who knows what he might do w/ it in a few years, but I just couldn't stop laughing. gotta love it. 
So I'm supposed to be at the fireman's carnival with a friend from school...but she never showed up...or called! I'm like wtf. such reliable friends I have. one doesn't know directions to her own 21st birthday party and never got back to me, so I missed it. another is all excited to go to the carnival, and then she virtually drops off the face of the earth. man, people rock."

"event","ugh, what a great week it has been. Monday I get my housing slip in the mail to find that I'm in Chase hall AGAIN!! I'm across the hall from where I was last year as a sophomore in the same freshman dorm! I mean, WTF! I am so not living in a freshman dorm in straightline as a junior. At least I got them to try to switch me to north campus, but the sucky part is that I have to move there by myself because my roommate ditched me to live on campus w/ her ""Christian friends."" whatever. and now my mom is yelling at me for something, I don't even know what this time. somehow, it's always my fault. you'd think i'd be used to it by now and that it wouldnt bother me. ha. Well at least next summer will be my last one at home. You have no idea how happy that makes me. I mean, I love my mom, but if we spend too much time together we really don't get along. and I think it's safe to say this is one of those times. 
Well, it hasn't been all bad. i got my tickets in the mail to go see Alice in Chains (my favorite band in the world!!) with Steve on August 13. I cannot wait! I mean, they had been broken up for eight years, so it was so cool to hold those tickets in my hand and think-I'm actually going to see AIC! 
wow, I feel a lot better having vented and whatnot. whatever-life's too short to stay mad. :)"

"event","Wow, i just got back from what was easily the best concert of my life!! I went to see Velvet Revolver, and Hoobastank opened for them. I almost caught a water bottle from Hoobastank-i touched it! but i didnt get it. then i almost got pick- i thought i stepped on it, but i didnt get that either. but it was all good-i was in the second row...i was ten feet away from Slash and Scott Weiland!! it was amazing-they put on a really sick show too. 
Then, to make things even better, i get back to the room w/ Monika-we parked in the handicapped space and came in singing ""The Asshole Song"" loudly at 1 am-and there was a vase of flowers and a really sweet note from my boyfriend waiting for me! He is so sweet, and he never ceases to amaze me. How did i get so lucky?!"

"event","well, SHS is doing the musical Oklahoma this weekend, so i'll be home to see it. can't wait to see everyone! Serena is coming w/ me-we actually have to write a report about it for music class. 
Only you can prevent microwave fires. ha ha Monika is never going to hear the end of it!! on sunday night, she was warming up cookies in the room, and they caught on fire!! we set off the fire alarm, so at about 9:30, all of West campus ended up outside because of us! our microwave still stinks. and of course, all the fire fighters made fun of me because in a blonde moment while leaving the room, i left my flat iron on...oops. 
Last night, Dan Halen and i checked out a haunted cemetery. something really did not want us there, at least in a certain part of it. seriously though, sometimes you don't even need to see anything to be seriously creeped out. 
well i've gotta get ready to go. i've already missed class today-i should be there now. but i'm gonna go over to steve's room, then to Katie's apt. to meet some hot guys!!! wow, I love college."

"event","Since I'm putting off my English homework, (and also, putting off sleep) I took that fun quizzy thingy that so many people have in their live journals. I got red, it sounds a lot like me i think. 

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/A/Aliteinthesky/1057725487_CMyDocumentsred.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""HASH(0x8ab36bc)""><br>You are the color red.  You are the most<br>controversial of all the colors.  You are often<br>easily angered, but as easily as you got<br>excited, you come down.  When angered, do you<br>have the tendency to be malicious?  Afterwards,<br>do you end up begging for forgiveness?  Maybe.<br>But you're incredibly generous, and, odd<br>enough, needy.  You love to hate, and<br>sometimes, you hate to love.  This color<br>describes you as generally edgy.  When in a bad<br>situation, you're pessimistic, and when you're<br>in a good situation, you're extremely<br>optimistic.  You're painfully tempermental, and<br>sometimes it hurts the ones you love.  But with<br>an exciting and stimulating attitude, you enjoy<br>talking to people and being social.  But aside<br>from your bold and outgoing attitude, you're<br>attention-needing and attention-getting.  This<br>color is associated with lust and desire--and<br>you are both lust and desirous.  You're a<br>protective person when it comes to the people<br>you love.  You're incredibly sharp-witted and<br>powerful (not to mention intelligent!).
<br><br><a href=""http://quizilla.com/users/Aliteinthesky/quizzes/What%20color%20are%20you%3F%20(Amazingly%20detailed%20%26%20accurate--with%20pics!)/""> <font size=""-1"">What color are you?

What do you think? lol

BTW Dan, if you see this, thank you so much, you made me feel so much better!"

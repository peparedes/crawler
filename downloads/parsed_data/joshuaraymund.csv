"event","long (but fun) day with the fam.&nbsp; had our annual easter picnic at the park today.&nbsp; was running on 3 hours of sleep cause i ended up going out last night and the parents guilted me into going to the 7am mass.&nbsp; by the way, last night was surprisingly fun! i had my mind set on just staying in and making it a netflix night but my roommate coaxed me into going out by getting me drunk. so i ended up tagging along with him and his friends to el camino for one of his buddy's bday... who, by the way, is a total cutie!

anyway, i ended up passing the eff out after getting home from the picnic.&nbsp; out cold for 4 hours straight.&nbsp; and now i'm up and can't go back to sleep!"

These pics are from Christmas Eve.  This year's theme was ""Italy,"" and I made a yummy mushroom risotto.  We also played a bunch of games and had a gingerbread house making contest.  You'll see in the pics.

I was too lazy to bust out my dslr so these are all snapshots taken with my bro's new Canon s90.

Time for the gingerbread houses.  We broke into four teams and were each given equal amounts of supplies: graham crackers, frosting, marshmallow fluff, and candy.  We had a total of an hour to build our houses.  This team made an RV, but to me it looked like a jeepney.

It rained pretty much all day yesterday.  

I'm in LA right now, Silverlake to be exact, staying at my cousin's place.  We went to J Lounge in downtown last night for a friend's birthday.  Had fun drinking, dancing, and acting stupid with some old friends.  Today we're preparing dinner for my auntie, who's in town.  This weather is perfect for staying indoors and preparing a meal."

My parents went persimmon picking last weekend, as they do every year.  They never fail to bring home bags and bags of these things as if it's the most magnificent fruit.  I personally don't see the appeal to persimmons.  It's like eating cardboard.

If you're driving north from downtown on the 5, you'll pass an artists supply store with this awesome mural.  I stopped by to snap this, and someone was watching me the whole time lol.  The colors are much better in person, these polaroids don't really capture that very well."

We ate at <a href=""http://www.noburestaurants.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Nobu</a> last night for Charlotte's bday.  The food was probably the best I've ever had (the sauces were amazing) BUT waaaaay overpriced for the portion sizes they give.  

We took a cig break after downing come cocktails before our meal cause the wait was rather long. l Iooked over at Charlotte standing under this light and told her to strike a pose.  The quality on this is really bad cause of the ISO setting... and I'm really bad at keeping a steady hand when I'm buzzed.

After dinner we were gonna go hit up some other bars in downtown but Charlotte realized she forgot her ID at home.  FAIL.  Instead, we drank at Russel's and reminisced about high school."

Downtown San Diego.

Polaroid SX-70.  600 film.  ND filter.

I'm running low on polaroid film. :(  I think I'm down to 2 packs.

But the good news is, Urban Outfitters will be selling 779 film and other polaroid products.  The bad news is, Urban Outfitters will be selling 779 film and other polaroid products.  Don't get me wrong, I love Urban Outfitters, but the problem with a store like that selling vintage photography products is that I feel like they're selling a trend more than anything else.  It cheapens the hobby and I feel like people don't appreciate the history or the art form itself.  Rather, people buy it cause it's cool.  The last time I was in the store I saw that they were selling twin-reflex cameras for $100, made out of plastic!  Way to go Urban Outfitters! (read: fuck you Urban Outfitters!)

I was at my grandma's house over the weekend.  She has this hand-carved wooden sculpture that I think my parents got her from Thailand.  

I try to spend as much time as I can with my grandma.  She's still fairly healthy for her age and remains, for the most part, able-bodied (at least enough to get around without assistance from a walker or cane).  However, over the past couple years she's definitely slowed down.  She's not able to walk as far as she used to without complaining about pain in her joints.  It was actually her birthday last friday (she turned 84), so my cousins and I took her to one of her favorite restaurants for lunch: Souplantation.  It was nice to see her happy and surprised that we were all there, especially since my cousins don't come down to San Diego as often anymore.

I love my grandma."

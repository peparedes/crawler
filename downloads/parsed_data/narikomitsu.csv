"event","Jason, I wasn't using you. How could I when we weren't even going out? Yes, I love Jay, but like I said, I can't have him so I've been moving on since I realized I never could. Right now I ahve Glenn, but because of all this shit, I gur=ess it's not for long. When I saw what you said to me when I was trying to chill, I broke down crying. It seems I lost you even as a simple friend. If you wanna believe I used you, then go ahead, because I know the truth and that's all that matters.
It seems I lost everything now. My site is down and I can't get it back up, 1/2 of the stuff is shit anyway. I'm leaving the forums when it's only been a week.
Glenn...I'm deeply sorry. And it's no lie that I love you too, but, that's one of my flaws, I love more at one time than I should. I guess it's time for me to live out my fear. I'm going offline, for good unless I need to look up something for a video game.
Jessica..I was NOT alone in the hot tub with Zach, Wayne and Uncle Jeff were there watching us and Zach's 2 little brothers were romping around in it as well! I told you that! Thanks a LOT Jess!
Jay....like I said...no need for anything anymore. The thing from 2 years ago is comming back to haunt me, and as long as I'm online, it will keep doing so. Good Luck with Jessa.
Naka....I'm sorry to have to do this to you too bro. You don't really know what's going on much, and I'm sorry for leaving you like this. Find a good Japanese girl that will keep your bloodline pure, and find a girl that'll take good care of you, as I would. It looks like we won't be able to meet for chinese food.

And a final Adieu to everyone. I'm deeply sorry, and I shall go so I can't hurt anyone anymore."

"event","...Yeah. again there isn't too much to say. We just painted the living room yesterday and that's about it, but being on those ladders and shit made my back hurt. I haven't been feeling well and my mother has been telling me I feel warm to the touch. I just feel plain sick. I even pulled myself away from my friends last night to get to bed early. I couldn't get to sleep till after Trigun because of my back, then I woke up at 5:30 and oddly watched Captain Planet, because I used to when I was really little plus it was just on, so, I got back to sleep sometime after 6 and before 6:30, then woke up again at, like, 10:00 still not feeling well, but I couldn't get back to sleep because my back is hurting and those fucking cardinals were trying to fly through the window again. It's starting to scratch the glass. We don't know what to do about them. I think there's a stupidity illness with the cardinals.
I did have a small dream last night, maybe two. First one was an indoor maze, picking up jewelry as I went along, traveling close to the floor, dunno in what though. One of the things I picked up was an old necklace I had a while ago, with a yellow Tiger's Eye pendulum on it (Oddly enough, that necklace broke and I sent half of the gem to Justin, but it had gotten lost in the mail so I sent another chip of one). The second...lemmie think....a hotel or something of some sort of a trip with people...there was a deadly spider of some sort, and if it landed on you then you're gone. One by one the girls were bit, and each time the dream would sort of start over in a new hotel with new girls. Something else happened in the dream too but I can't remember it. Eventually, though, I faced the spider. It was, like, hunting me, but by that time there were guards to help. but I had gotten into the bed when the spider came. I called for help and tried to avoid it. It was too fast so I tried to swap it away, but I think he stuck to my hand, and that was it for me.
...now that I think of it, somewhere in that is a scene in a lunch room. I couldn't find a seat anywhere. I found a 1/2 empty table with girls I supposedly knew. I dunno what happened but I remember hiding a handful of ramen noodles in my hand and eating them like that. Odd, huh?
.....before when I was typing the spider part I had remembered something else, but I forget it now.

Isn't that something? And I didn't know anyone except my mom in the necklace dream. I've only had one dream with my online friends in it, maybe a year ago, with Justin, Jason, and a few others, and my sister was in it. What happened there was we were at my grandma's house. IRL she had a 4 feet deep pool with a diameter of about 24 feet across, and a ladder to get in and out. Well, in my dream there was a small deck around the top of the ladder, and there were two pools side by side, touching, with a ladder between them to go from one to the other. It was about midnight in my dream and all my online friends were in it along with other people and my sister. I was jumping off the ladder. At one point I'm standing, about ready to jump again when I look up into the moon, and noticed there was ""blood"" in the corner (there's something about that, I'll tell you in the end) but I reach at my chest to grab my Tiger's eyes gem (from the necklace mentioned earlier) and it wasn't there. I said Oh well and went to jump in, but everyone was standing still now. I asked what was wrong, and I forget who replied but he said that I shouldn't get in, that I should get my necklace or something bad will happen. I shrug it off and I jump in anyway. Now the first time I had dreamed this, when I jumped in, someone was holding me under the water and the water turned to blood. The second dream I jumped in, the water turned to blood and started to boil. In both, some people got out from fear, others shrugged it off. Weird, huh? And thing is, the guy who held me under, I think it was Justin, I know at first it was one of two, but now that I think of it, it was Justin.
The thing about the bloody moon and Tiger's eye...some say it's a bad omen if you look to the moon and see 'Blood' in the corner, so the Tiger's eye is supposed to be for protection. The tiger's eye, ironically, stands for clarity and bravery, and depending on the type of person or not, those properties can be magical. The blood part...I have seen for myself. At times there does seem to be blood in the corner, but it's rare. The reddish look...I forget how it happens, but it's obviously not 'blood'.

Well...those are my interesting stories for the day. I'll type back later if I can. Till then, happy dreams!"

Today is Independance day and 10 days till my birthday. It's storming on and off...hail on the way, some flooding going on...sirens whailing up and down the roads..it's turning into chaos. Earlier it was perfect tornado weather..the air pressure dropped, and we felt it. Kinda creepy, but I think our fireworks are gonna be called off. Our road was already a river, gutters over flowing, the Shenango dam is probably gonna go above the normal level for sure, the river that runs into it is right at the bottom of my hill, I'm about 1/2 way up from it and it's not a very big hill to begin with.
Well...lets just hope everyone is safe.
I'll write later tonight if fireworks went off or not."

A while later I drove to my grandma's house...MUCH closer...but Wayne drove home because the sun sets at the top of the hill and it's hard to back out and see...let alone at sunset with the sun reflecting off the road.

Since the last entry...this guy asked me out...I accepted, then 2 of his closest friends...one of which I trusted and hooked me up with him in the first place, well they said he really didn't like me. He was SUPPOSED to meet my mom this weekend, but I called it off. He promised me he would call me on thursday, STILL hasn't 2 days later! I don't care what he says now, he's not good enough for me and he's over with, after only 5 days. PLUS, Jessie took me roller skating tonight, and I realized how NOT over Brodie I was. A guy was there and I could have sworn it was him, but it wasn't. It's happening again, I'm thinking every tall, dark-haired skinny guy is him, except last we talked he told me he got highlights, so I dunno now. I was doing so well then I had to realize my Brodie thing again. 
Anyone see that Bruce Almighty? The love story in it, and the girl's prayer near the end? Yup...I'm EXACTLY like that...pray that I still love him and the pain is too much so I pray to forget about him and get it out of my life so I won't be in pain any longer. Sad, no?
*Sigh* And I FINALLY left TFF for GOOD this time, after 2 years. about time, it's not the same as it used to be. 2 people are being asses, one of them of no authority and acts like he is.
Jessica's mom is PISSED at me and LOATHES me, said I called the CYA on her and I DIDN'T, said I signed a letter to her along with others and I DIDN'T, she hates me for things I didn't do! THEN she takes us to the rink to skate and the WHOLE time she's bitchen about ""two-faced"" people and good examples of them..INCLUDING ME when I'm right behind her! THEN she tells her hubby when she gets home that she didn't flip till I got out of the van and said I didn't do it. HAH, she was flipping the WHOLE way when I didn't say a word! Jess's dad stood up for me but I think he thinks I did it too, but he's nice enough not to yell at me about it and let me come over to see Jess. Her dad is COOL, her mom needs some mental help. Trust me, If I had the number, I WOULD HAVE CALLED, but I DIDN'T, and I didn't even learn about this LETTER till today! *sigh* Her mom hates EvERYONE though, including EVERYONE that works at the rink, thinks everyone is two-faced. *rolls eyes*

Yeah, the world isn't the same, and I feel this specific chain of changes are a negitive one, but what can ya do, ya know? Just be miserable along with it I guess...right?
Oh well, enough babble for now."

"event","Damn, how many dreams, weird ones, can I have in a row? I'm tellen' ya right now, I normally don't have this many dreams, let alone weird ones, in a row like this.
Here's how I described it to my sister:
 
 Kagome Mitsu:  ....How many weird dreams can I have in a row?? 
 Kagome Mitsu:  this is just freaking me out 
 Venus4584:  What was it this time? 
 Kagome Mitsu:  ....this one is long, but it starts out at a school...brodie goes to it too...and like, 6 or so of these teachers have a different method of physically abusing kids in a way that weakens them and really brings them down. The one I encountered most was one that put needles in the back and they ended up looking like swollen bee stings, and later in my dream I was hanging out with Brodie and another girl, still broken up, but he had these marks on his back, and we were eating lunch in some dark cafeteria,... 
 Kagome Mitsu:  and he was talking about him getting a patriotic tattoo and I asked to see it but it was on his butt cheek but he pulled his pants down just enough for me to see the outline and the flag was back-wards and upside down. Then another part of the same dream, Brodie is walking somewhere and this girl and I are hanging all over him....litteraly hanging. It had something to do with those teachers again, I see it in my head but I can't explain what's goen on... 
 Kagome Mitsu:  there was another part about it being a military type thing in a small room and entering by a small parachute exercise through a small window or something with these weird creatures around. 

Weird, huh? And Brodie was in it too, and I think just as a friend but at times he warmed up to me like we were going out. I would say, besides my mario dream as a kid, this is by far one of the weirdest things ever. On top of that, I wake up at 1:30 PM AGAIN."

"event","Yes, ever since I was little, I would have a random dream about driving, not as much then as now since I AM driving. Usually I would be driving at night, and someone I had minimal control over the car, and it would take me somewhere and get me lost and I wouldn't know how to get back, or I would swerve without meaning to and it would refuse to keep straight. Well, last night I had another grocery store dream, and every time it's the same store that I never see IRL, my ""dream"" store. well, my om was in it as well as me, but she gives me the keys and I gout to the car and I drive. In a second part, or maybe a totally different dream, I'm at a school, and I have my mom's car there and MY car (I really don't have my own yet, just mom's) But it's white like my cousins. Well it's time to go home and I wonder how I'm gonna get both cars hom. A car is waiting near by with my ""dream friends"" and I ask the mom if she'll let one of the girls drive one of the cars and I'll drive the other and if she could follow me so she can pick the driving girl up so they can take her home. THEN I had troubles finding out which key went to which of 3 cars! Not 2 anymore, but 3! *sigh* So this weird thing happened where I'm in a window of an old storage room without boxes...and this phoenix come in the room, I think through a closed window, but me and the driving girl got on him and she's wondering how we are gonna fly and I told her just to believe we can fly and we will. Then my mom came in the room and looked scared we got out the window and my mom called me back. Soon i'm back in the room, girl and bird are gone, and I end up flying MYSELF and it scared the shit outta my mom. That's all I remember.

I heard from a speech in school that flying means you wanna get away from something, and a tornado means your emotions are all wrapped up and confused, also a sign of torment with rage from that. Here's how I believe this to be true:
When I was little, I always had dreams of flying away from my (at the time) step father, and I had dreams with tornadoes. He used to abuse us. After the divorce the dreams stopped till recently, and they are different. So far no tornadoes, but flying has returned. Once from a girl at school wanting to kill me, and this one, I think, to get away from my emotional torment over losing Brodie. In my dream I seemed so sad and depressed, upset, which is how I've felt since he broke up with me.
I'll write more about the day later after it happens."

So, why am I not over Brodie yet? He got over me within a single flippen week, yet it's been a month and I STILL cry over him? Why is it so hard for me to move on? I mean like, yeah, I have accepted the fact that we split up, but not the fact that we may still have a chance, though it looks VERY slim, and on his end he's probably forgotten all about me and has a new girl by now. Why can't I move on, and how much longer must this go on? *sigh* I dunno.

"event","Ok, this is just WEIRD. I really need to stop watching animal planet!
We used to live in a white house on my grandma's road quite a few years back, it takes place there. I was upset because we lost all the animals in the divorce, so my mom got me 2 ponies, an older dark brown/black one named Mistress and a white/cream one named Sugar. Well, they wondered off into the woods back there, and we forgot about them. My dream takes place a couple years later, when I find them again and put them in the old dog pen in the back, the yard was fenced in and JUST large enough for 2 ponies to temporarily be there. They kept backing off from me, showing obvious fear and hate of me. Well, I go to get stuff for them and when I come back they are gone. I call all over the yard for them, but this boy in a wheelchair comes out of parkdale ave, a dead-end street just down my road, not by far at all. He tells me a family on there took them in. I hop on my motorcycle and go down, and find the house with them in a fence stall. I look at them and start crying as I noticed they were ill. A guy came up to me, told me the dark one had cuts and one of them infected her eye, and was gonna be tested for further physical abuse. The other one hadn't been tested yet. He said the dark one could die, but the white one had a chance, and if been through physical abuse, I could be charged with animal cruelty. I bawl my eyes out. Not only did I actually have ponies, but they were mine and being taken away from me. All I did was lean on the gate and cried as hard as I could. My mom came down and got me and took me back up, where my friend jessica was told what happened. My older sister made fun of me. Then the dream flashed, and were were in the back of a truck. The dark pony was laying down and facing me, and I was laying next to her, still in tears. She must have been under sleeping gas or something cause she didn't move. I kept stroking her muzzle and neck, telling her how good a pony she was and that she would be ok. We were driving through forested areas, and oon a tree we passed was a flyer showing her injuries. I cried harder, and the pony woke up or something and moved her head back in fear, and I thought she was gonna bite at me, but I kept still and talked to her on how I was sorry. I made a daring move and laied my head on her neck, hugging her. After a moment She put her head down so it was around me in a horse hug, as if saying she understood and that she didn't blame me. I woke up after that, and my eyes were watery and I felt like I DID cry, but I didn't 'cause my eyes weren't red. I told this to my mom and she was amazed. I rarely have dreams, and when I do, they're like this. Very weird."

"event","Ok, I always wanted one of these, and my friend has one at the dead journal instead of the live, but my other friend has one here and just got a code so I got it!
Right now here's how things stand:
My friend thinks she's pregnant
My boyfriend broke up with me 3 weeks ago after 21 months of being together
We just moved to a new town, but the up side is a hot tub and new guys
Ummm....*thinks* That's about it for now. I'm 17 next month on the 14th, my sister is engaged, my cousin graduated yesterday so the grad party was today, ummm.....Oh yeah. I love writing so visit my personal link, my corner of the wire. It has a lot of art stuff in it too. I'll post new stuff in here too as I get them.
Ummm.....I'm trying to find a friend of mine from pakistan, named Imran. I had lost contact when police took over my e-mail and all my IM accounts, but that was a few months or so ago and I won't say what happened, it's in the past.
Ummm.....that's about it.
Till tomorrow!"

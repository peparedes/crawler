"event","There are times when i wonder what goes through the rider's mind at any moment. I have control most of the time, but when Vengeance needs to be served, it's going to happen. Still, why did he pick up that girl? She was safe but i guess there was a kinship there, because of her pyrokinetic ability, maybe. Still, i hope she knows the rider can be dangerous, and i don't want to see her getting hurt. She seems nice, the fact that she's a mutant or a morlock doesn't bother me, i've seen things that would set most people into a hysterical fit, or make them wish they'd died outright. Happens when you deal with dark forces, you lose loved ones, friends, family. We ended up at the Statue of Liberty, we spoke, i joked and i think she relaxed a bit, still her life must be hard, appearing the way she does, sometimes i wonder how fair life can be for people like her. I shared candy, conversation and jokes and we parted friends, i gave her my number. In the end, that's a pretty good night, hopefully we can meet again and talk, we'll see.

"event","I went and visited my riding buddy Penny, only to find out she's very much in the mommy way. Definitely something odd about it, but she seems to be alright so i won't pry, she is a big girl. She reminds me a bit of Roxanne when she was having the kids, same smile and all that. I feel like an idiot mentioning to her that their gone. She kind of lost it and cried,....alot. Took a bit to calm her down, and i hope she'll be alright, but this is the way life is. They're gone and i have to move on, i need to figure out what to do with my life, what to do with my curse. Can i find hapieness again, am i willing to take that risk? Guess only time will tell....

"event","I went to the Metropolitan Museum to get away from things for a bit, it's suprising how you can be in a crowd and still find a way to be alone. Still it was nice to just take a break and just look around at all the history and things of the past, sometimes that's how i feel, like something from the past, i really don't have anything in the present so i kind of feel like those things, a relic. 
While i was there i ran into a pretty young woman, there was nothing about her that really stood out, but for some reason i knew i'd seen her face before, then i recalled, i saw her in a photo, one Logan carried in his wallet. Logan being the mutant Wolverine, one of the most deadly people on the planet. Her name is Kitty Pryde and apparently she's an X-man, she's been one since she was a child. I can't really dream or understand a life like that, i wonder what it would do to a kid, still she seemed very sweet, and she's a young lady with a good head on her shoulder. Something about her tells me she had an old soul, like she knows alot more then a girl her age should. It was nice to speak with her, to just be with someone with such a level head. Who knows, maybe i'll see her again, i can hope. 
That's all for now ....

"event","Ever since i've gotten into this city, i've felt disjointed to say the least, i really have no connections around here, so when i was called by name by a girl i didn't even know, it as surprising. 
Her name is Penny Perriwinkle, now there's a mouthful, but she knew me. Apparently he's a bike fan and seeing as i was a stunt driver, she knew my name and alot about me. I won't say it's not flattering considering she's as cute as they come, but it was still disconcerting. For someone who looks like they belong on some fashion magazine, it's surprising to learn she's a gearhead, she loves bikes, and apparently she's worked in the circus. Every moment i talked with her i liked her more and more, it's nice to feel that with someone, i haven't felt much of anything since.....well since. 
She calls her bike Darla, it's purple and is more colorful then any bike i've ever seen, but it fits her to a tee. She's going to give me a hand getting my bike up to snuff, it's been awhile since it got the TLC it deserved and she really wants to help, so i'll be heading over there tonight to get it done. 
There are people who walk into our lives and make them brighter just for being there, Penny is one of them, and i'm glad we met. She reminds me a bit of Roxanne, and i guess that's good in a way. Maybe all the light in the world didn't go out when she passed away,.....maybe there' hope.

"event","For a long time i thought the Ghost Rider was one thing, till years later i discover it's something completely different, but one things is for sure, when Venegence needs to be served up he's there to do it. 
I met a young woman named Clarice, she was cute, kind and obviously a mutant, we seemed to hit it off pretty quickly and were having a talk as we walked towards Central Park, i needed to think and clear my head. That's when i felt it, deep within my soul, the Ghost Rider wanted out, and he wanted out now. Whoever he was after had to be a special kind of evil to cause that reaction, and he was,..some crazy who called himself Ni,...which i found out means 2 in japanese. He was a killer, plain and simple, no remorse, no pity, no mercy, and the blood of many was on his hands. When i'm the Ghost Rider i can understand why he is the way he is and why he does the things he does, and this needed doing. Vengence was served and i don't think that person will be forgetting it very soon.
I feel bad though leaving Clarice there, but Vengence knows no schedule, nor does it care for anyone's time. I guess a quiet time and a quiet life are just not in the cards for me. This rider will ride the highways alone.

"event","Well i just got into the city, and it's been a long haul all the way from Arizona here. Been making ends meet by working odd jobs, but mostly trying to stay low-key, i don't want to attract any attention at the moment, i'm tired of the constant fighting an dealing with all that, just need some time to take a breather. I've known for a long time i'm a loner, but now i really feel it, Roxanne is gone, the kids are gone, i've got nothing an no one, just evil always one step behind me.
Decided to pull into Central Park and get some rest, instead i ran into a kid who may, or may not be a mutant, he was blending like a Chameleon, and he could animate rock, for all i know he might be a mystic or something, but i can't tell. Either way we talked, i brought him a hotdog and i suggested he head over to Xavier's to stay. I remember hearing about that place from Wolverine back in the day. I drove him over and dropped him off, i hope things work out for Jacob. He seems like a good kid with some bad luck, let's hope his luck turns out better then mine in the end. 
Well, that's it for now, i'll keep this journal of mine updated from time to time and maybe, someone will remember me.

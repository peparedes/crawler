It's been a busy November so far.   I signed myself up for NaNoWriMo again, and I'm extremely behind.  I don't even know where the month has gone, honestly. 

But anyway...

A lot of people have moved in the past year or so.  So a lot of the addresses I have are out-dated.  And it's seasonal greeting time of the year again!!! (they're not Christmas cards, technically ;)) 

So if you'd like to get mail... and who doesn't like getting mail.... Either leave me your mailing addy in the screened comments below or send me an Email.  If you want my addy, let me know.  

Emily"

"event","Hi Everyone.

I started this LJ in August of 2001, at the young age of 19. At that time, I had just finished high school and was moving away from home.  University was a mere two hours away from all my family, but it could've been the moon for how I was feeling.  

Two of my best friends were moving to the city with me, the other was moving to Windsor.  The rest of our ""gang"" was splitting up, some moving to other provinces, others hours away.  These were people that I had spent almost every day with, had endless laughing sessions, a few crying ones, and loved every minute of it.

And I knew nothing would ever be the same again. 

I stayed in this LJ for 5 years.  5 trying years where I lost some of my best friends.  Where I went from being considered rather smart (not the smartest, but smart) and creative, to being bottom of the barrel and barely hanging on.  I went from A's and praise to D's and endless conversations revolving around how I was deemed a failure and why they should bother keeping me in school.

I found new friends - some that would stick to me like glue when they needed me, and fall away when that wasn't the case anymore.  Some that would be worth more than all the gold in the world.  Some that remained quiet in the woodwork until we would re-connect and then there would be more cherished time.

Somehow, I survived.  Those who were meant to stick by me did.  Those who needed time on their own left.  Some have returned, some have not.  Those times saw me through different adventures and strange places that were memories, regardless of the good or the bad.

This LJ has seen me through 9/11.  It saw 2 summer jobs and into a temp position that became my job now.  It saw me through the loss of my high school best friend and the gain of new one.  It saw me through residence, an apartment with 3 roommates to an apartment with 2 and finally an apartment with 1.  It saw me through the adoption of my cat, Jake, and endless unrequited crushes.  Many, many other moments as well.

I left this LJ in November of 2006.  My last post here was 101 weeks ago. I moved into a blog of my own, big time I thought, and I was excited.   There are some of you, like Linda, who have been here since around the beginning.  Others whom I picked up along the way.  I've been still reading, and following along with all of your adventures.   I doubt that a lot of you remember me - and that's fine.  Time for a re-introduction.

My name is Emily and I'm 26 years old.  I'm living with my cat in a 1 bedroom apartment.  I'm working at a job that I enjoy most of the time, however like all jobs, it has its moments.    I'm currently single, as I have been for a while.   Permanently, in fact.  

And where we go from here?  Who knows."

"event","Ten things I know about life
Number 10 - Life is sexually transmitted.
Number 9 - Good health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.
Number 8 - Men have two emotions: Hungry and Horny. If you see him without an erection, make him a sandwich.
Number 7 - Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
Number 6 - Some people are like a Slinky.....not really good for anything,but you still can't help but smile when you see one tumble down the stairs.
Number 5 - Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing.
Number 4 - All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism.
Number 3 - Why does a slight tax increase cost you two hundred dollars anda substantial tax cut saves you thirty cents?
Number 2 - In the 60's, people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal.
AND THE NUMBER 1 THOUGHT FOR 2005:
We know exactly where one cow with mad-cow-disease is located among the millions and millions of cows in America and Canada but we haven't got a clue as to where thousands of illegal immigrants and terrorists are located. Maybe we should put the Department of Agriculture in charge of immigration."

I have my reasons for this.  But it doesn't mean that I'm a mean and nasty person.  I'd like to think that I'm not, but hey, we're all allowed our own opinions.

If you'd like to be on my friends list, simply leave me a comment and I'd love to add you back.  I love to meet new people.  So don't be shy :)

Edit: right now, I'm still in the processes of blanking old entries.  which means that, why you can still see old ones, there will be no public new entries."

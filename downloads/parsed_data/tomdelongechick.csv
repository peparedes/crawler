thunder, lightning, rain - lonely yet serene.  it is dark at 3pm,  looking out the window, watching the flowers blow on the trees as the rain pours down and i sit in the solace of your face. your face, your face with your bright blue eyes and your perfect mouth - i would love to kiss that mouth. i would love to know what you are doing at this very second, and see the smile that lies upon that mouth.  that smile that has been burned into my brain - my only saving grace.  it is 3pm and i am wishing you a happy birthday, well knowing you can not hear me - and i miss you. 27 more hours to go..."

anyways... jimmy wrecked my car not too long ago. that alone is going to cost me between 5 and 15 thousand to pay for the guys car since it was jimmys fault, not the guy who he hit, even though he should pay it all since he was the one who wrecked my car. . i got him a job to help pay for it, he said hed help as much as possible so i said id pay half. not even two weeks after he had the job he quit and is now unemployed so isnt able to help me pay for it. i need a new car cause i dont have power steering now and my car looks even worse than it ever did... surprising that a kia can look worse, huh? and funny cause a week before the accident, some guy was gonna buy my car for 4,000 so id have that money to get a new car or put towards a car. now my cars worth MAYBE 1,000. i quit round the clock to make better money at billy jacks, waitressing. but im not getting enough hours. 10-2 or 11-4, 4 days a week. i need a 2nd job... anyone know places that are hiring right now? i also need to save money for moving to atlanta soon. yep...geoff and i are moving september 1st, if all goes as planned. which is good, i dont like the valpo area too much, and i dont have many friends here anymore. my fault?-maybe, who knows. hopefully ill meet alot of cool people in atlanta fast.  planning on throwing a decently big party at my moms in august, before i move. if ya wanna come, let me know. i went to the waterpark with my sis a lil bit ago. then me, geoff, my sis, jimmy, and chris went to 6 flags a week ago. it was fun. id have to say the best ride is deja vu. its sooooo much fun!!  things with geoff and i are pretty good. we argue alot, but we get over it fast. amy moved out of my moms house without any notice, without even telling anyone... just up and left. shes back with her mom in demotte, after being in the hospitol for a week because of her back. valpo is boring... i need to learn how to ride a bike then get one so i can go out and have fun on that. i miss going out and riding with amy. it was fun.  i made this strawberry frozen desert thing yesterday out of some recipe book and it looked so good, i went to eat some today and it was nasty! that dissapointed me. lol. fathers day is sunday, i think ill get my dad a dvd player. then the 11th is my mom and sisters b-day. the 16th is geoffs, and i wont see him for that cause he'll be in nebraska with some asshole. mine is the 24th. and umm yea....

"event","so the stupid bitch owner of the cinnamon tree, audrey, fired me after a week of working there. she didnt really have a reason to, but oh well. she put me in a bad mood anyways, so its probably better that im not working around her. since then (last week) i have gotten two jobs. round the clock is one of them. and this place called papolano's in chesterton is the other. both are waitressing jobs. this should be good! :) cause i liked waitressing before, i was rather good at it, and made good tips. so hopefully this will be the same, possibly better. and its good cause im not working too early in the morning at either of them, or too late at night at either of them. so i can still go out after work and stay up late without worying about lack of sleep. yay!! this weeks schedule is...

youll never see the courage i know. its colors richness wont appear with in your view. ill never glow the way that you glow. your presence dominates the judgements made on you. but as the scenery grows, i see in different lights. the shades and shadows undulate in my perception. my feelings swell and stretch, i see from greater heights. i understand what i am still too proud to mention - to you. you say you understand, but u dont understnd. you say youll never give up seeing eye to eye. but never is a promise and you cant afford to lie. youll never touch these things that i hold. the skin of my emotion lies beneath my own. youll never feel the heat of this soul. my fever burns me deeper than ive ever shown - to you. you say dont fear your dreams, its easier than it seems. you say youll never let me fall from hopes so high. but never is a promise and you cant afford to lie. youll never live this life that i live. ill never live the life that wakes me in the night. youll never hear the message i give. you say it looks as though i might give up this fight. but as the scenery grows i see in different lights. the shades and shadows undulate in my perception. my feelings swell and strech i see from greater heights. i realize what i am now too smart to mention - to you. you say you understand, youll never understand. ill say ill never wake up knowing how or why. i dont know what to believe in. you dont know who i am. you say i need appeasing when i start to cry. but never is a promise. and ill never need a lie...

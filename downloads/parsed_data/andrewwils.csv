Work is for people who have jobs, you'll never remember class time, but you'll remember time you wasted hanging out with your friends.  So, stay out late, go out on a Tuesday when you have a paper due on Wednesday.  Spend money you don't have.   Drink till sunrise.  The work never ends, but college does!""

And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when""

Time for reflection:

- always dreamt that I would become a professional baseball player
- If baseball failed, a bigtime Business guru
- a girlfriend that was accomodating to my needs and wants
- If business failed, an artist or a song writer

Looking back on my life thus far,
I got to the point in baseball, where I knew I could go no further. As one New York Mets scout once told me, ""You have a tremendous amount of talent, but thousands of other players have that much talent as well."" I decided that after one season of playing college baseball, enough was enough.

I'm at the point in my life, where I need to make a decision, do I go into Business as I'm currently studying towards - or do I share my artistic talents with the world?

I have been offered entry level modelling contracts with various different companies, but do I really want to get into that shit? I was thinking about putting a display together of my various drawings... but do I want to do that? Not sure.

We won't even touch the girlfriend aspect. :)

Decisions, decisions... I thought I would bore you all with these details.

What to say, where to begin ... 

Today was a semi-productive day ... It started out with me going to my Economics Tutorial, and failing my quiz miserably... followed by me going to my teacher's office and getting a second attempt at it... Go Wils.... Wils sits down at the teacher's office, she hands Wils the Quiz .... A blank stare comes over Wils' face .... hmmmmmmm ..... Then all of a sudden the idea hits him... Just guess! Brilliant Idea... Well I guess sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do... 100% later - Wils leaves her office thinking he is the smartest man alive all the while he is missing his girlfriend Ashley Tremendously.

1:14 pm - Wils arrives to write his Earth Science Midterm - WHOA! Wils should have stayed home..... 55 Multiple Choice Questions .... Wils answers the 12 that he knows ... This is where it gets interesting.... He decides that guessing is only option, Hey it worked the first time for him... so why not now?! Poor Wils... The results of the Test are not known.... but it doesn't take a genious (Like Wils thought he was...) to figure out the expected results! Where's my Ash so I can complain to her, and she can brighten my day - the only person I have met that can do such a thing!

6:00 - 9:30 pm - Wils slaves over his math Course. Stupid Group Projects. Three and a half hours later - Project is done and handed in. Next stop: House, where he can cram for his economics Midterm.

Wils the self-proclaimed Genious, figures that all he needs on his midterm is 65% and then, he can get 100% in his tutorial, 90 % on his projects and 70% on his final... and still manage an overall mark of 74 in the course! Genious I tell you! --> We'll see how this exam goes tomorrow! I need ASH here pronto to help heal my wounds! Miss you Babe! Love you.

- Time for Bed I dare say .... eagerly awaiting that phone call from that special Girl!

Take Care, and may I remind you... Genious' are not self-made, they are discovered.

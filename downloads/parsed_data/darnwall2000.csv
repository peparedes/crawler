"event","You know, I was going to post this extremely loooooooong entry about how everything is turning out quite perfectly for me nowadays, how it seems like I was wandering through a dark spooky forest previously and have now stumbled upon a beautiful clearing with a waterfall and birds chirping and sun shining and blah blah blah... yeah, sentimental crap like that. In fact, I've been trying to write that entry for about 3 months now, and especially during these last 2 weeks cuz ALL KINDS of sweetness has been happening to me lately, but... well, let's just say that I'm tired of waking up with keyboard prints all over one side of my face. So now, you're just basically gonna hafta take my word for it. Here's a really, really brief rundown for you.

1. Leaving November 1st (possibly earlier, but most definitely no later) for Airborne Cryptological Linguist job in Air Force. Sometime soon, I'll give you a complete list of why it's by far the most awesome position I could have possibly chosen. I think the phrase ""Bling Bling!"" sums it all up quite well.

2. Got a raise, slight promotion, and a few benefits from the part-time job I currently have at Lowe's. What, you didn't know I work at Lowe's? I've been working there for the past 4 months, where have you been?!?!

3. Cielo is the most greatest thing to ever happen to me. Ever. It will literally take me hours to explain all of why, so I'm not even gonna try. I'll just leave it at ""she's perfect for me in all ways."" Oh, and here's <lj-cut text=""a picture."">a picture:

<center><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/darnwall2000/MiAmor.jpg"" />
Are we the perfect couple or what?</center></lj-cut>

4. My other friends are awesome too. Nuff said.

5. My family can be kinda cool. We're taking a <a href=""http://www.royalcaribbean.com/findacruise/cruiseDetails/itineraryAndPricing.do;jsessionid=0000wPdJvhdk33r93lSMJ3eBvaR:10ktmeta1?packageCode=NV7ECMI7"">7-day Caribbean cruise</a> in early September, and well, ""psyched"" isn't quite sufficient for describing my current state of being in regards to this. ""Bouncing off the walls"" is closer, but still not completely there. ""Jubilant""? Almost...

So yeah, life is good. One day, when I have the entire day to myself, I'll be able to more fully explain myself, but don't hold your breath. However, I AM open to answering individual questions, so feel free to shoot away. Or not. Whatever."

"event","Well, tomorrow, Cielo is coming to my house to have dinner with mi familia. Needless to say, we're both kinda nervous cuz we really don't know what to expect. After all, this is the first girlfriend I'll have ever actually introduced to my folks, which in itself would probably be manageable, but then there's the whole language thing (as usual). I guess I'm gonna hafta spend all day translating for dear Cielo, but my Spanish is still utterly craptastic, so I don't believe that's gonna work so well. And then there's the fact that Cielo's already seen the inside of my house before (my parents went out of town for their anniversary on June 6th, so we took advantage of the empty house and had an anniversary our own, hehe), so now she's gonna hafta act like she's never seen it before. And she better do it well, too.

So all in all, we've really got our work cut out for us, so wish us luck / pray for us / do whatever crazy stuff you think will influence this dinner for the better. Life would be so much easier if my folks ended up really liking my girl. Oh dear god yes!

Well, that's all for now, other news later (when I'm not falling asleep as I type)."

"event","So apparently, I only write in this journal if 1) life is going EXTREMELY well, 2) life is sucking hardcore, or 3) life is sucking hardcore, but I'm trying to make it seem like it's going well. This is definitely about option #1.

First off, let's get the whole ""I love Cielo"" bit out of the way real quick, so I can get it out of my system and get to more of the good stuff. Well, yesterday was our 2-month anniversary. Yep, 2 whole months of dating perfection. Now usually, I hate keeping track of ""month anniversaries"" because I am <b>extremely</b> well-acquainted with the fact that they mean absolutely nothing. I mean, Superman could probably date Kryptonite Girl for a whole month without any major problems, and a dead clock has the right time at least twice a day, so the number of <i>months</i> a couple has been together is entirely insignificant. However, Cielo is such a sweetheart that she calls me on every month-anniversary to tell me how much she loves me, and then she buys me a gift. In fact, she gets me a gift like every other week, just to say ""yo te amo."" God, I love that girl. She has been the best thing that has ever happened to me in El Paso. Scratch that - she's the best thing to ever happen to me, period. It will be impossible to find another girl who is as in tune with me at all times, the way she is. The only problem I'm seeing is that perhaps we're moving a bit too fast: We already have names picked out for our first boy and girl (I'd write them here, but don't wanna ruin the surprise, hehe). Also, I'm apparently scheduled to meet her entire family after I return from my East Coast trip, and that scares the utter crap outta me. Fortunately, her siblings all speak some English, and I seem to have already outranked and outdone her ex-boyfriend by miles, so all should go well. As for her meeting MY folks... well, that's an entirely different story. My mom has been bugging me for the last month about meeting her, but argh... if you knew my mom, you'd know why I'm a slight bit worried. But it'll hafta happen eventually, so we'll see...

You probably saw that ""East Coast trip"" part and are thinking, ""wait, what East Coast trip?"" Well folks, I've finally booked myself that long-awaited ticket, so this Friday (i.e. tomorrow), I will be on my way to NYC, baby!!! I'll FINALLY be able to see my boy Steve in his natural habitat, and also meet up with some family members that I haven't seen in like 7 or 8 years. HELL'S YEAH!!! You can probably tell that I'm way fucking excited about this; that's cuz I NEVER get to do shit like this usually. NEVER. In fact, this will be the first time in my life that I'll be farther north than North Carolina on the East Coast. Not only that, but I'm finally gonna see the Big Apple AND the nation's capital, AND possibly the City of Brotherly Love. ALL IN ONE TRIP. [Please wait while Darnell does the Happy Dance of Joy.]

OK, back. Now, a brief update on the whole Air Force deal: still...fucking...waiting. I pretty much have the whole linguist thing in the bag now, after like 3 months of believing there was absolutely no hope, but getting that job seems to have added on another 6 months to my waiting time. And it's fucking KILLING me; I want to get out of El Paso so bad now, I can practically taste it. Sure, I'll be away from my Luz de mi Vida (my pet name for Cielo, she loves it), but it's all good cuz as soon as I get to Cali, she's planning on flying there after me ASAP. This also falls under the ""moving too fast"" category, but I'm actually happier about it than I am annoyed. This way, I'm taking the most important piece of my home area away with me to a better place, a better job, and a better life. I really couldn't ask for more."

"event","Well it's almost 3am, my family just went to bed, and I'm still awake, so I figured now would be a good time to update you all about this crazy thing called Darnell's Life. Oh, it's a strange and magnificent thing, constantly changing and shifting in entirely unexpected ways. Right when I think I've got it all figured out and can start plotting its next move, <b>BAM</b>, something occurs that knocks it way the fuck off course.

Let's take my whole Air Force situation as an example. I've been dealing with these damn military bastards since February of 2005; I've gone through four (that's right, FOUR) different recruiters; and I've actually signed contracts for two different Air Force jobs thus far, with a 3rd one on its way; yet, I still don't have a fucking clue how it's all going to end up. Remember how I was going after that one <a href=""http://darnwall2000.livejournal.com/33218.html"">linguist position</a>? (Perks include: $10,000 bonus, I get to spend a year in sunny California learning a new language, can further my education at any university I want FOR FREE, and more...) Well, more than a month ago, my recruiter's boss called me up and told me that my exception-to-policy had been denied... 3 weeks prior to him calling me. Needless to say, I was more than a little pissed-off, disappointed, and upset, but since I was once again told that there was nothing I could do about it, I kinda forced myself to get over it and become content with the job I already had signed up for: Air Traffic Controller. The thing is, my departure date for that job was scheduled to be May 30th. Yes, that would be 10 days from now. So for the entire month of April, I told everybody that I was joining the Air Force and leaving on May 30th. Then May rolls around, and I suddenly decide that I really DON'T want to do ATC, I still want something different, preferably computer-related (for obvious reasons). So, I call the Air Force job-placement people up and... well, let's make a long story short: I basically find out that there's a loophole that would get me into the linguist job after all. So now, we're back on the whole linguist deal AGAIN. Gone is the May 30th deadline; now, it's back to the endless waiting that will probably take months and months because the gov't hates me and likes wrapping me up in red tape. I'm seriously considering just saying ""fuck it"" and going with the ATC thing, despite the fact that their tech school is in Mississippi. If there's one place I'd rather not go, it'd be the redneck-breeding ground known as the Deep South, but I think all this waiting is gonna get to me sooner than any drunken ignorant redneck can, so yeah.

So there's that, and then there's Life Derailer #2: Cielo (I'll try not to stray into gushing and all that sappy shit, I promise). Let's just say this girl really has it in for me, hardcore. We were talking about our experiences before we met, and she told me that she had had plenty of chances to start other relationships after she broke up with her ex, but she never felt safe enough to put her trust into any of these guys, until she met me. In fact, she hadn't kissed any, hugged any, exchanged numbers, NOTHING, until she did all of the above with me that first night. Even that very night, she had turned down all other offers to dance before I walked in (and we know what happened <a href=""http://darnwall2000.livejournal.com/35506.html"">after that</a>). So, this wasn't some crazy drunk party-loving chick I happened to hook up with; this was someone who had decided not to trust guys ever again, but then changed her mind upon first sight of ME. I asked her ""why me?"" and she said she could just sense it, kinda like it was destined that way or something. Kinda eerie, if you ask me. So now, we've gotten to the point where she's planning to move out to California with me (she has relatives in Los Angeles). Let me make sure you all understand: she's willing to leave her family and all her friends, to discontinue her current education at her university, to live in a land where people speak a language she's not familiar with, all for the sake of being with ME. I'm not quite certain how I feel about this: on one hand, I truly love this girl, and I know that she'd be an excellent mother and wife; on the other hand, this completely screws up my plan to be the world's greatest manwhore. Never heard of a married manwhore before, have you? Yeah, me neither.

OK, I'm dozing off as I type this, so I guess I'd better finish it tomorrow. More"

"event","I swear, if someone made a movie of my entire life, it would become the world's greatest drama overnight. ""Titanic"" would be considered a lame comedy in comparison. It's like God Himself pulls a few strings here and there, just to make sure things don't turn out anything like the way I want them. Yet, through it all, I can still see some light at the end of this long, dark, menacing tunnel. Ironically, some of that light is coming from my Luz del Cielo (Light of the Sky, if you don't remember), with whom I spent the most amazing night with this past Saturday. And I'm not just talking physically, even though there's absolutely nothing to complain about in THAT area; no, I mean mentally and spiritually and... actually, I don't really know WHAT I mean. All I can say is that the girl is DEEP, on a level that I've never quite encountered with anyone else before. An example: the way her last (and only other) relationship ended was by her walking in on her boyfriend and some other chick while they were making out in bed, both butt-naked. She yelled at the dumbass piece-of-shit and hit him, and then he, the greatest scum of the earth, hit her back. I wouldn't even be able to lay a finger on the most wretched bitch in the universe, yet this asshole is able to hit his girlfriend of 5 years, after she catches him in bed with another girl. Unbelievable. Cielo told me that she didn't want to continue living after all that, and I could totally see that she wasn't exaggerating or dramatizing in any kinda way. Imagine what something like that would do to someone's entire psychological being; hell, it took ME 3 months to recover from breaking up with Priya, and I didn't even catch her in bed with anybody (not saying that she didn't do anything like that, just saying that i didn't CATCH her). Yet somehow, Cielo's made it through 6 months since that disaster, and now she has... me.

I can't believe how badly I'm falling for this girl. I try to write a short LJ entry about all the crazy shit that's going on in my life, and I end up writing paragraphs about HER, and only her. I hear a song on the radio, and I think about her. I see a commercial on TV, and it reminds me of her. I hear her voice over the phone, and... ah, I could go on and on (looks like I already have), but this is very very bad. She's already making future plans for the two of us, and contrary to everything my brain is screaming at me (""SHE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH, MORON!"" ""YOU'RE TOO YOUNG FOR THIS KINDA SHIT!"" ""WHAT IS YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY GONNA THINK ABOUT ALL THIS?""), I find myself thinking that maybe a future with her wouldn't be so bad. She truly has all the qualities I have ever desired in a woman: patience, intelligence, maturity, passion for life, and extreme beauty, to name just a few. Dammit, what the hell is happening here? I'm so utterly lost...

This entry wasn't even supposed to be about her."

In one sense, that's a good thing, for a reason I'm not about to share, but on the other hand, it seems like I've been missing out on a bit. I think I'll allow myself to wade back into the world of LJ, if only for a little while."

"event","Hi, yes, haven't updated in a long time, blah blah blah. You should realize by now that there isn't gonna be many entries in here from now on.  Maybe one or two utterly life-changing/mind-altering/havoc-wreaking events, but that's only if the mood catches me. So anyway, the latest mind-altering event in my life: my family and I went vacationing in Phoenix last week. <lj-cut text=""'You did WHAT?'"">My sister's missionary organization was having a <a href=""http://www.mastersconference.com"">conference</a> there, so the rest of us decided that we'd go along too. And lemme tell ya, the conference was pretty fucking sweet, even for those of us who aren't exactly ""enamored with love for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ"". You didn't have to be Christian, or even religious, to get something important out of it all. So what exactly did I get out of it? ...Well, that's something that would take me 2 days to explain, so I'm just gonna skip it. Let's just say that it all kinda blew my mind, and it's singlehandedly gonna cause me to do astounding achievements in the future. Yes, it was <i>that</i> powerful. We also got to watch <a href=""http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2006021021"">the Phoenix Suns play against the Sacramento Kings</a> at the US Airways Center. Holy shit, it was good! I used to think that professional sports were dull and passionless compared to college sports, but this game defnitly proved me wrong. No wonder ppl pay so much for those tickets.

On the way back from Phoenix, we stopped at the house where I grew up when my mom and I lived in Tucson, and took a bunch of pictures. I hadn't been in Tucson since I was about 7, so it was defnitly cool to check out a far-distant portion of my childhood. It makes me wonder how my life woulda turned out if we had just stayed there, instead of ending down here in the middle of nowhere. It's no secret that I think Arizona is about ten gazillion times prettier and more exciting than EP can ever hope to be, and plus the girls there are SCORCHING hot. I seriously did not see a single fat girl, the entire time we were there. But it's not like I can change the past, so I'm just gonna have to hope I end up there sometime in the future.</lj-cut>

Speaking of hot girls and changing the past, it's reached my attention recently that tomorrow (er, today) is Valentine's Day. <lj-cut text=""Here's why it honestly doesn't matter to me anymore"">For the 2nd year in a row, I'm completely, totally, 100% single, but somehow I really truly don't care this year. Part of it is cuz I view V-Day as a totally bullshit holiday, kinda like Sweetest Day, purposely concocted to employ guilt as a means to extort money from your average American consumer. I mean, come on people; if you truly love someone, then you shouldn't have to wait for a certain day each year to show it. You should be able to buy your sweetie flowers and chocolate on any day of the year, not just on the day when Hallmark tells you you're supposed to. But anyway, the other part of it is that I've decided not to date anyone for the next few years or so. I've kinda realized that committing myself to just one single female is truly a bad move on my part. A few reasons why: it detracts my attention from other important aspects of my life, as well as from my other friends; it ties me down somewhat and keeps me from doing some of the stuff i truly enjoy doing; it prevents me from ""experimenting"" the way I plan to as soon as I leave EP; and last but not least, it's just biologically unreasonable. Here, lemme say it a different way: in my experience and observations, getting into a relationship causes you nothing but trouble, unless you're absolutely positively certain that the person you're getting involved with is someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. And even then, you still gotta be careful. But I, for one, have very little hope of finding that Special One out there anytime soon (cuz it'll defnitly take someone extra special to deal with ME for a lifetime), so in the meantime, I plan on having as much fun as possible. And yes, that will entail copious amounts of random hook-ups and one-night-stands, so yeah... um, what was I talking about? Oh yeah, Valentine's Day is really easily-brainwashed suckers, and I sincerely hope that my future wifey or whoever won't get all pissy and shit when I get her absolutely nothing for V-Day.</lj-cut>

On a random side note, Sean Paul's ""The Trinity"" album is all that, plus a big bag of chips and some dip. It's up on my list with Black Eyed Peas' ""Elephunk"" and Eminem's ""Marshall Mathers LP"". There is seriously not a single song on the entire album that I dislike. I guess the whole Caribbean dancehall rhythm it's got goin on really jives well with my soul. I haven't stopped listening to it ever since I dl-ed it 2 weeks ago.

OK, that be all, folks. I'm out"

"event","So yesterday, I tried to write this humLONGous entry about Steve's awesome visit to El Paso, and about why I haven't been updating IN this lj at all, but then I got bored and unmotivated, and quit. Which is basically why I haven't been updating IN this thing, at all. So deal wit it. But I will at least leave you with few pics:
<lj-cut text=""Prepare thy pure virgin eyes..."">

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/darnwall2000/8ae24c12.jpg"" height=""270"" width=""400"" />
Where's the best place to go big pimpin? Texas, of course!

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/darnwall2000/1108e2bf.jpg"" height=""270"" width=""400"" />
Have you ever seen two studlier guys? I think not.

I have more, but I'm too lazy to upload them. I think that last pic is by far one of the best pics ever taken of me, if I do say so myself. So yeah, good times with the International Man of Mystery in my hometown; I was pretty worn out by the time he left, but it was well worth it.

I was looking at aforementioned amazing picture (it's taped to the top of my dresser mirror, where it belongs), and started thinking about how very different all of my friends are. Just look at ethnicity alone: I'm good friends with a half-Chinese-half-Polish dude, a Peruvian-Austrian, a Mexican-American (duh, I live on the freakin border), 2 Russians, a Sri Lankan, and 3 Indians. And I dated an Indian and an Irish-Italian. Hmmm, what's up with all the Indians? It's probably the Indian 4th of myself attracting them. Then why the hell isn't the 3/4ths Caribbean part of me trying to attract some fellow Caribbeans? Eh, whatever. Anyway, the point is that America is actually doing a pretty good job being the melting pot that it tries to portray itself as, despite its racist past and its outsider-intolerant present. I'm glad that my children will be able to see MLK's dream fully come true.

But, I still don't feel as though I've met enough people from different cultures to have a good understanding of the world beyond America's borders. Steve and I had dinner with one of my mother's Nigerian clients, and they were all mad impressed by Steve's extensive knowledge of other countries. Meanwhile, I couldn't say shit because I haven't been further than 3 miles from either American border. This, my friends, is pathetic; I live practically ON the fucking border, so how have I not gone anywhere past it in my entire life? This is something I'm gonna hafta correct in the next few years, PRONTO. And it would start with me getting that goddamn linguist position and getting the fuck out of El Paso. Steve's visit only helped me to realize even more how utterly stifled I am in this place; no fewer than <b>3</b> different people told me that while he was here. OK, I think I'm gonna skip the ""El Paso is a fucking cage"" rant I feel coming on, I'm sure you're all tired of it now.

Anyway, it's rare to find a friend that can wake up your life, excite your mind, and dazzle your entire family during a brief 4-day visit. Steve, I'm glad you came; now it's my turn, bro. My turn.</lj-cut>"

"event","Wow, it's been a ridiculously long time since I last updated this thing. Then again, I barely even look at it anymore, so I guess it's not TOO surprising. Anyway, I have a lot to write, but it's VERRRRRYYYY late and I need to get to bed, so here's a brief synopsis:

1) I got rear-ended on Friday night. My truck is now literally crumpled up on the driver's side, from the bumper to the back tires. This makes me very sad :(. But, the people who hit me were very nice, so they're gonna make sure their insurance pays for the damages. More details later.

2) Steve has booked a ticket to come here and visit me for MLK Weekend (January 13-16). This, of course, makes me very happy. Finally, the Dynamic Duo will be able to wreak havoc upon El Paso, the likes of which have never been seen before! I can't find the right words to express how very psyched I am about this.

3) I'm this much closer to getting my linguist job from the Air Force. The ""higher-ups"" contacted my recruiter 2 weeks ago and asked for paperwork proving that I've been making my payments (which I've definitely been doing). Problem: none of my creditors will provide such paperwork, it's ""against company policy"" or some such bullshit. Solution: I told my recruiter to tell the higher-ups to just call the assholes. Problem: I accidently overdrew my bank account by 3 dollars on Monday, causing one of my creditors' payment checks to be returned, unpaid. Solution: I'm going to overnight a money order to them tomorrow morning, so that it'll hopefully reach them before any Air Force people decide to call. Keep your fingers crossed.

4) Jeremy and Satish left the best drunken voicemail I've ever heard in my entire life on Saturday nite/Sunday morning. I just finished chatting with Jeremy on AIM, which is why I'm writing this entry so late. Man, I miss Drunken Pool Thursdays and Necto Saturdays like nothing else. I desperately need to make one more trip to Michigan before I proceed with the rest of my life.

OK, that's it for now, more details on all of this stuff later. Ciao"

"event","Well, well, well, if it isn't ye olde LJ!!! Long time no see, buddy, how's it hanging? Probably wondering what I've been up to since the last time I wrote in here, huh? Alright then, here goes:

<lj-cut text=""Air Force shit""><u>Air Force shit</u>
If I had a normal life, I would currently be holding a complete Air Force contract, stating what my job and position is, how much I'm gonna get paid, and when my exact date of departure is. Unfortunately, normality doesn't seem to exist my internal dictionary, and thus I'm currently engaged in a lengthy waiting game that probably could've been avoided. There's a long, long story behind that which I don't really feel like telling right now, but here's a brief synopsis for ya: I got completely fucked over by the Air Force job counselor, was given a job that I absolutely didn't want, raised a huge fuss about it, and was told that the job couldn't be changed. This was quite unacceptable, so I was forced to unleash the unbridled fury of my parental units, which invariably produces results (not always <i>good</i> ones, but something is better than nothing). We had an <strike>intense tongue-lashing session</strike> nice little chat with my recruiter and his boss, and now I'm waiting for an exception-to-policy (ETP) that will allow me to take the linguist job I wanted all along. I need an ETP because linguists require top secret security clearance, and the Air Force doesn't usually grant those to people with financial problems. They figure I'd be more susceptible to being bought off by some Russian commie or something. The boss wouldn't have even bothered trying to get one, except I made one of the highest scores they've ever seen on their Language Aptitude test. Not sure how I did that, but whatever. The whole ETP process supposedly takes 30-45 days, so now I get to twiddle my thumbs and drool until I find out if I get it or not. It better fucking go through, cuz it would suck balls to go through all this and end up with nothing.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Thanksgiving""><u>Thanksgiving</u>
We ate and got fat. That's what the holiday is for, right? I also chatted with Feinstein for the first time since I left Michigan. There are very few people on earth that I can talk to and be completely, totally, 100% understood, and whom I can understand 100% likewise. There are many who make it to 75%, 80%, even 90%, but as for 100%, there are only 3: Steve, my sister,... and Feinstein. It's odd, cuz both Feinstein and I have a little sister each, are children of 1st generation US immigrants, are conservative but not Republican, were raised with similar morals and religious beliefs, are incommunicado with our exes,... the list goes on. It's like having a twin brother that was raised by a different family. Anyway, we were pretty happy to hear from eachother, and are definitely planning to visit eachother regularly in the future.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Church""><u>Church</u>
We finally finished the whole Leadership School deal, which was surprisingly quite enjoyable and enlightening for me. It taught me stuff that I can actually use later in life, rather than the ""bow down to your savior Jesus Christ or burn in eternal hell forever"" stuff that I was expecting. But now, I have a 4-hour gap on Sundays that I'm unaccustomed to, so I decided to join the church's Christmas choir. ""But Darnell, you couldn't hold a note if someone came and superglued it to your hand!"" First, yes I can, so shut the fuck up. Second, even if I couldn't, it'd be a good chance to improve upon what little vocal skillz I currently have. Anything that causes self-improvement is welcome to me, no matter what area the improvement is in. Besides, it's a good chance to meet <strike>hot babes</strike> new people.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Other shit""><u>Other shit</u>
Speaking of meeting ""new people"", I gave out my phone number to some cute Applebee's waitress with a nice ass earlier this week. She wasn't really all that interesting; I only did it cuz my boy Steve told me to on the phone while I was eating my food. Only a friend like Steve can give you good last-minute advice from a thousand miles away. Anyway, I don't actually expect her to ever call me or anything, but it was still a pivotal event for me cuz it was the first time I've ever done that outside of a club or bar. It tells me that I'm not a chickenshit coward anymore when it comes to the ladies; the only reason I had any girlfriends before is because <b>they</b> actively pursued <b>me</b>, rather than the other way around. Especially Priya; that girl dumped some dude and pulled every trick in the book for 2 months straight to hook up with me (hence my sincere surprise when she dumped <i>me</i> a year later; I guess what goes around comes around). So now, I won't be content with the first girl that smiles or winks at me, which is good cuz I'm gonna hafta protect my future Air Force money from all the little golddiggers out there. Yup yup, I thoroughly plan to go out and be the biggest pimp in the universe once I get out of EP, cuz being locked up in this house with my folks has truly driven me insane, and I've got a lot of lost time to make up for.</lj-cut>

Alright that's all for now. I'm out"

Yet, when I look in the mirror now, all I can see are my shiny pearly whites gleaming back at me, completely metal-free. Goddamn, it feels so good; I can finally turn on the full Darnizzle charm without having to worry about having a huge piece of cheeseburger or something hanging from my teeth.

*Pauses to lick entire row of teeth* Yup, they're definitely gone. Sweet. :-)

And in slightly related news, <lj-cut text = ""I'm about to become a military boy...yup"">I just got final approval to join the Air Force today. Yes folks, you read that correctly: Darnell is soon to be an official United States Air Force Airman! People, this is the ""big news"" that I've been hinting about for the past few months; this is the reason I came back to EP and did literally <i>nothing</i> to secure a real full-time job for myself. I actually started this process way back in freakin <b>February</b>, after realizing that I hated being poor and consistently broke; unfortunately, the fact that I've <i>always</i> been poor and broke (and thus in massive debt) kinda got in the way. Apparently, the Air Force doesn't like accepting fools who don't know how to manage their own finances. So I left Michigan, returned to the safe haven of good ol' El Pisso, and proceeded to bust my ass contacting all of my debtors, setting up payment arrangements, disputing incorrect items on my credit reports, the whole nine yards. Now, I only have 3 debts left on my credit (U of M, U-M Hospital, and U-M Credit Union... notice a pattern?), and payments are being consistently paid to all of them. After that, the only thing blocking me from getting in was my mouthful of metal, and well, hehe... mission accomplished. We ended up having to go to Juarez (that's the part of El Paso that isn't in the U.S., in case you didn't know) to get the braces off cuz in EP, such an operation costs $450. In Mexico, it cost us $80. God, I love Mexicans and their ridiculously low prices.

So tomorrow, they're sticking me in a hotel for some briefing, and then on Thursday, I take my physical exam (pushups, situps, etc) and go on to choose my official Air Force job. Despite my computer skillz and whatnot, I'm actually hoping for a linguistics position, cuz then I get a $10,000 signing bonus. Oddly enough, you don't even have to know any foreign languages beforehand, you just have to prove your ability to learn new languages. I figure, ""Why not? I've been wanting to learn Japanese or Chinese anyway."" But regardless of all that... free food, free housing, free health benefits, free dental that I don't need anymore, free college loan repayments that I <i>desperately</i> need, here I come!!! I always did say, ""If it's for free, it's for me!"", so this just fits in perfectly! You're probably thinking, ""Why the fuck were you so insistent on keeping that from us? It wasn't really all THAT important or huge, nothing to get all stupid about. You're such a dumbass, Darnell."" Well, I wasn't hiding it from you as much as I was avoiding putting it all in writing for myself, cuz I was trying like mad not to get my hopes up, so it wouldn't hurt like hell if it didn't all pan out. Like I said, I've been working on this since FEBRUARY... that's plenty of time for doubts and worries to pop up like little fucking demons poking at my brain. The funny thing is, I had been working on it with Michigan recruiters this whole time, and they were seriously dragging ass and taking their dear sweet time. Last Thursday, I finally told a recruiter here in El Paso; now, a week later, I'm practically in. So, to the Michigan Air Force guys, I give a nice big ""F, U, you dumbshits, thanks for wasting all my goddamn time! I coulda been in 3 months ago!"" Thank god there aren't any AF bases in the Midwest; I really wouldn't be able to stand another 4-6 years up there.

Alright, that's it for now. I'll let ya'll know what job I get, when I'm leaving, and where I'm going in my next update. Til then

Half an hour later, we find out it was towed, despite there being no indication <b>whatsoever</b> that it was on private property. $165, down the drain. Shitastic.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Lots of random shit, you really shouldn't even bother reading this..."">
But I guess that's not gonna stop ya, huh?

So, I chatted with Meredith today on AIM. I'd put excerpts of the convo on here, except 1)it was way too raunchy for the eyes of any of you casual LJ viewers, and 2) I already closed the chat log (oops). Let's just say that the least disgusting part of the conversation was where we discovered that my piss and shit are the secret ingredients to Old El Paso Salsa. Yeah, and it got even worse. I swear to god, that has got to be one of the most hilarious girls I've ever met in my lifetime; she's like #5 on my list of people that I miss most from my Umich days, after Steve, Jeremy, Swarup, and Feinstein (there's your shout-out for the week, Steve). Chatted with Rup and Jeremy last night; Feinstein tried to IM me today, but I was at work. Gonna hafta e-mail him or something, haven't really talked to him since June.

It was nice catching up with everyone on AIM these last few days, but that will probably end as soon as my mom gets back on Wednesday. Ya see, el problemo numero uno of living at home is, well, living with HER. I can barely take 2 steps in this house without my mom wanting to know where I am, what I'm doing, how long is it gonna take, wanna watch a movie with her?, why don't I rub her feet for a while?, can I hand her that drink sitting 6 inches from her hand?... shit like that, 24 hours every fucking day. Seriously, I would have never been able to go off drinking with my boys on Friday, cuz as soon as I would've walked into the house with her here, she woulda asked me to bring her some water or something, smelled the booze reeking off of me, and raised all the worst kinds of hell possible. My dad, on the other hand, was sound asleep when I came home that night; gotta love my dad. So, in the larger picture of things, I need to get out of this place ASAP.

I know I've been saying that for the past couple of months, but that's actually becoming a much, much closer reality for me now. In fact, I should be able to tell you all at the end of this week, with 100% certainty, whether or not I will still be here 2 months from now. As you can probably imagine, that has me totally psyched. Seriously, it's what's been keeping me going since September. I hate keeping everyone in the dark like this, but I just want to have a full green light before I start talking about it. It's more to keep my hopes down than anything else.

Anyway, I was rereading my post from yesterday, and realized that I almost sound like an alcoholic or something. ""Let's get wasted, music to my ears""? No, that's not how I am ALL the time... just most of the time ;). Seriously though, it wasn't the alcohol that got me excited, it was the prospect of finally being able to relax and let loose for a while with some good friends. I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not happy with life unless I'm doing something stupid, reckless, crazy, or all of the above. Take me driving, for example; when I'm driving on I-10 in my truck, I average about 85 mph, and that's only cuz it's kinda difficult getting my 1993 Toyota truck over 90 (my max in it thus far is 102mph). Now, I-10 is a 60-mph zone throughout the city, so you'd think I should be afraid of the popo and whatnot, right? Well sure, but that's kinda why I do it; it's that whole adrenaline rush I get as I'm weaving in and out between cars, looking ahead and watching out for the cops in their usual spots. And so far, I haven't been caught once in EP, despite twice having the person <i>directly behind me</i> pulled over, and twice speeding up to a cop car from behind. Kel once described it as ""you're like a caged tiger that's been let loose when you're behind the wheel of a car."" Well, it's not just when I'm in a car; I'm simply at my happiest when I let my inner tiger out, and alcohol is one of the things that unlocks the cage in a hurry. So yeah, just wanted everyone know that I won't be needing Alcoholics Anonymous anytime soon... hopefully.

Ok, that's it for now. Toodles :-P

"event","So yeah, I guess it wasn't a bad Halloween weekend for me. At least, that's what everyone told me Saturday morning after I woke up in the middle of my living room and found 20 messages on AIM asking me what the fuck I did the night before. But I digress; let's start at the beginning...

<lj-cut text = ""It was a cold, windy... no actually, it was kinda warm..."">Friday, 7pm: I'm sitting in front of my computer, utterly and pathetically depressed. It's the first time in 5 years that I haven't had plans to go out, get utterly wasted, and act like a complete fool for Halloween. People, it's the only time of year when I'm practically guaranteed to make out with some random chick (5 years, 100% success rate), so hopefully you can understand why I'd be so bummed out. Anyway, I'm feeling pretty desperate for something, <i>anything</i>, to take my mind off of my desolate despondence, so I call up my boy Stump. As mentioned in a previous post, Stump is the biggest computer nerd you can possibly find, so I'm not really surprised when he says ""I don't actually feel like doing anything except playing WoW (World of Warcraft) tonight, bro."" But the last thing he mentions is ""I've still got a crapload of alcohol left over from our last party, so if you want, feel free to come over and get some."" I think, ""nice offer, but i don't really feel wasting a buzz watching Stump play WoW.""

8:30pm: Suddenly, getting drunk on free alcohol doesn't seem like such a bad idea. My plan was only to get my drink on and leave within an hour, but upon arrival, Stump pulls out some Johnny Walker Black Label whiskey, Absolut vodka, Cabo Wabo tequila, and Captain Morgan's rum (my favorite), and goes ""let's get wasted, my friend."" Music to my ears.

9:30pm: We're both already quite buzzed. We decide to call David up to join in the festivities; he grudgingly concedes.

10pm: David arrives to find 2 drunken fools making fun of people on ""Iron Chef"" (best cooking show, EVER). We realize that none of us have eaten, and drinking on an empty stomach is BAD, so David orders us pizza, since he's the only one who's making any sense at the moment.

10:45pm: Pizza arrives. Meanwhile, David's started drinking, and we've moved on to making fun of some pornstar on HBO. A debate erupts regarding the authenticity of her breasts. Hilarity ensues.

11:30pm: My memory gets rather fuzzy at this point. Apparently, David and I leave to get shakes from the nearby Whataburger. I go whooping and hollering down the street, waking up several old farts, and then wander through oncoming traffic. We somehow arrive safely at Whataburger, where I proceed to flirt shamelessly with the drive-thru window girl, yelling past 2 register people and a manager in order to do so. At least, I <b>hope</b> it was flirting; all I know for sure is that whatever I was saying was making her laugh pretty hard. I think I was saying something along the lines of ""you make burgers GOOD! You can make ME a burger ANY day!"" LOL, pure idiocy. Anyway, we get our shakes (and 2 burgers that I felt the need to order, despite the pizzas sitting around at Stump's), and are firmly instructed to leave. I bellow a goodbye to everyone in the restaurant, and David shoves me out.

Sometime later, I dunno: I've spilled 2 drinks on Stump's carpet, and shared numerous embarrasing stories. Stump decides it's time to kick us out. I somehow convince them that I'm OK to drive home (which is fine, cuz I live barely a mile away), and... yeah, that's the last thing I remember.

6am, Saturday morning: I wake up and find myself lying spread-eagle in the middle of my living room, with a half-full water bottle lying next to me. I finish off the bottle, get up, and go to bed.

9am: I wake up again, in Hangover Hell. Mixing 4 different types of alcohol = BAD. So, I take a looooong, hot shower, and then go to my computer and notice my away message, which goes along the lines of ""Drinkkling ist fuuugn, wheeeee!"" Yet, I don't remember putting that there. Meanwhile, there's messages left by various people asking why I'm such a pussy and don't know how to handle my liquor. 2 chats later, I realize that I somehow IMed everyone on my AIM list and left the most ridiculous messages on earth. For example, my message to Swarup: 

darnwall2000: ;adiube shfwnggouy.
darnwall2000: wasssup, bit]ch?/
darnwall2000: i'mm ffuyckinf druuuuumnk!
darnwall2000: aholla at mew somertime!@

Yeah, it was bad. And it seems EVERYONE got one of these. Sigh. So, moral of the story is: Drunken times with friends = good. Drunken IMs to entire buddy list = bad.

"event","Yesterday, off of a whim, I decided to open up AIM Messenger for the first time in like 2 months. I start it up and, BAM, both Jegan and Elisha are instantly talking to me. Jegan was expected, cuz he does that all the time, but I hadn't talked to Elisha since May, so that was cool. Then today, I left an away message saying ""I miss you peeps, leave me a message,"" and when I came back home this evening, DelMastro, Sarena, AND Feinstein had all left messages saying ""we miss ya too dawg, hurry up and come back!"" Kinda made me feel good and sad at the same time: good, because it's nice to know that you're missed, but sad, because I really, really, really, really do miss them all. Really, really badly. Really. This entire weekend has just been one big fat Missing-My-College-Peeps-athon for me. It all started after I hung out with my boy David on Thursday; we did our usual thing of eating fast food somewhere (in this case, Arby's), and then playing XBox for a few hours. Now, lemme make sure ya'll fully understand: David has been best friends with me longer than anyone else on earth (8 full years), and despite me almost killing him in the infamous car accident 5 years ago, we've never had any fights or falling outs and such that most friends go through. I think it's cuz we're so alike that we were probably identical cousins in some past life or something (ever see the Patty Duke show?). So, hanging out with David is always going to be a good time; yet, after leaving his house Thursday night, I felt completely... um, i dunno, off-kilter? unbalanced? blah, I give up. It was like, I had fun, but not the kinda fun I actually wanted to have, ya know? No, prolly not, but whatever. Anyway, since then, all I've been doing is thinking about what kinda crazy shit I could be doing in Michigan right now, wondering what crazy shit everyone else is up to, wishing there was some way we could all do some crazy shit together a few more times... It's just been a very gloomy weekend for me. And to clarify: it's not Michigan that I'm missing (oh, HELLS NO!), it's all the people that I was close to up there, whom I could hang out with on any given weekend and have a ludicrously awesome time with. And I don't just mean through drinking and clubbing (though that's a large part of it); i miss watching movies with Meredith and Elisha, playing NHL 2004 with Jegan and Swarup, Drunken Pool Nights with Jeremy, basketball/getting high/just chilling with Feinstein... All that good shit that I just can't find down here in EP. I only have two good friends down here, and their only forms of entertainment are computer games (they're both WoW addicts), XBox games, and anime. Yes, they have become 100% geekified; thank god I got out of EP before it happened to me too.

So, I wanted to go up to MI for a few days + Halloween weekend, but when I mentioned it to my mom, she frowned and said ""We'll see."" That's Mom-speak for ""Hell no, over my rotting dead body, you little bitch."" Or something along those lines. But now, I'm starting to feel slightly desperate to get the fuck out of EP for a while, if only for a few days, so I'm afraid I might resort to drastic measures or something. I'll try to keep my sanity for a little while longer, but I can't make any promises. Pray for me

Seriously, I'll sit down on my computer at 10pm thinking, ""hmmm, now's a good time to write down some of this shit flowing through my mind...but first I'll check my e-mail."" Two hours later, I'm out cold. Next night, same thing. Three nights later, I finally muster up the mental presence to 1) remember the entry I thought of 5 nights ago, and 2) stay awake long enough to actually write it. LJ and I just aren't the best of friends, I guess.

Actually, it seems I treat my best friends that way, too. Last Friday, both Steve and Slava called me up while my mom and I were shopping at Costco. I chatted with Slava for about 5 minutes, then told him I needed to go and would call him back in a few minutes. Steve called right after that, and I did the exact same thing to him. Today is Tuesday, and I still haven't called either of them back. If I was one of my friends, I'd hit me upside the head everytime I saw me. On my own behalf, I will say that I tend to stay busy for about 12 hours each day, but that's still a pretty lame excuse. But whatever, it's not like they're not used to it, or otherwise they woulda ditched me years ago.

So what have I been so busy with lately? Well, this past Saturday was my dad's 41st birthday, so <lj-cut text=""of course, craziness ensued..."">we wanted to do something special for him (seeing as how both my sister and I should be long gone by this time next year). So, Friday night, we put on a mega-performance for him, no holds barred. I did impersonations of Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Johnny Gill, my sister did Tina Turner and some other singer, mom was MC, and then we closed with all 3 of us doing the Supremes. ""But Darnell, the Supremes were all <b><i>women</b></i>."" Thanks genius; if I didn't know that before, I'm sure I figured it out after sis and mom wrestled me down and put a wig and dress on me. Quote of the night: ""Thank god you were born a boy, cuz you definitely make the ugliest woman I've ever seen!"" I'm not sure if that was a compliment or an insult...

Saturday night, we took Dad to <a href=""http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2005101507"">this preseason NBA game</a>. I thought it would suck, but it was actually pretty fun. It was kinda cool to actually see people that I usually only read about online, like Carmelo Anthony (who really does have mad skillz). I wish stuff like that would happen more often around here, cuz us El Pasoans don't get to see much way out here in <strike>Mexico</strike> <strike>New Mexico</strike> West Texas. Sunday, mom and I spent all day putting together a collage of dad's immediate family (parents, siblings, wife and children) and pictures of him at important times in his life. It turned out EXTREMELY well, if I do say so myself. Dad was mad impressed.

So, yup, that was my weekend, fun times with the Dad. You know, throughout it all, it never once occurred to me that hey, this is actually just my stepdad. Maybe it's cuz people always tell us we look alike, we're constantly laughing at each other's jokes while others are lookin at us like we're from Mars, and I dunno...he's just a really, really good man. I can't imagine my family life without him, just as much as I can't imagine it without Mom. And that's what truly makes us such a close family.

"event","I would have updated this like 4 days ago, but I've been coming home utterly worn out and going straight to bed for the last week or two. <lj-cut text=""So now I got lotsa shit to say..."">It also got pretty chilly recently (lows around 60... yes, that's considered cold around here), and I guess any type of cold weather forces the fuzzy animal in me to go into semi-hibernation. Seriously, I don't know how I survived in Michigan for five straight years...

Speaking of Michigan, looks like I left just in time to avoid seeing the worst season our football team has had in umpteen years. You know it's gonna be a rough season when my UTEP Miners have a better record than the Wolverines. But despite the team's current shittiness, I still find myself missing Football Saturdays there with a passion. If I was gonna make a list of my favorite places on earth, ""student section of the Big House"" would be, um, pretty high. ""Victory party at Necto's"" would be next on the list, but I should be able to make THAT one a reality sometime in the near future (like Halloween), so no worries. Unless the Darnell Vacation Curse strikes again, in which case, I'm fucked. It's a pretty hefty curse. I'm gonna hafta shake it off sooner or later though, cuz Steve recently bet me that I won't vacation on the East Coast anytime in the next 12 months. And I don't lose bets. If there's one thing my family is known for, it's going far above and beyond to prove someone else wrong. So Steve, be prepared to bow down and say ""Darnell, I was wrong, you were right... Forgive me."" (Highly unlikely that he'll actually do that, but I can dream. I want some kinda reward, dammit!)

So, I was looking up names for my future children earlier today (don't act like that's weird, you know you think about it too), and dragged up some interesting stuff. <a href=""http://www.bostonuk.com/names/default.asp"">This site</a> has the most perfect description of <a href=""http://www.bostonuk.com/names/names.asp?Name=Darnell"">me</a> I've ever seen. Sex appeal? HELLS YEAH!!! I also found out my <a href=""http://www.bostonuk.com/names/names.asp?Name=Dwayne"">middle name</a> means ""little dark one"". Funny shit. How about you?

Speaking of sex appeal... Have you ever met someone and almost immediately felt a great connection with them? Like, you somehow felt completely comfortable with that person despite knowing them for barely 5 minutes? It happened to me the first time I met Priya (I'm sure you remember, Steve, you commented on it later that night), and it's happened 2 or 3 more times since then. I've found it to be a pretty good indicator of compatiDarnellity. Well anyway, it happened to me again about a month ago when we dropped my sister off to start her whole bible college/missionary camp thing. At the time, I didn't think anything of it more than ""hey, cool girl"", but then yesterday my sister mentions that Cool Girl has expressed an interest in me as well. A rather STRONG interest, according to my sister. So now I'm stuck knowing that I have a purty good chance with a beautiful, mature, intelligent girl that my own mother thinks very highly of (a combination neither of my exes ever really had), but can't do anything about it cuz... well actually, I'm not sure. Mostly cuz I'm too stupid to think of something, and too chicken to put it into effect. Story of my life, really.

Speaking of exes, Priya sent me a message over facebook a week ago. ""Just saying hi, seeing whatcha up to"" kinda crap. Apparently, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/darnwall2000/29396.html"">my clone</a> has vanished from the picture without a trace; she probably decided to dump him for no reason, cuz it's about that time of year for her. So anyway, as of now, I still haven't figured out what to write back to her, if anything at all. Should I go with the a)""fuck you, you whore, stop bothering me"" approach, or the b)""I'm good, nice to hear from ya"" one? Maybe I should go with the c)""Who are you again?"" line, or I could start down the insanely-stupid path of d)""Wanna get together next time I'm in Michigan?"" This really shouldn't be such a big deal, and I had actually forgot all about her for quite a while, but everytime she pops up like this, I kinda revert to ""God, I miss that girl"" mode. It's all about the connection, man; even after 2 years, 1 month, and 6 days, I still remember how good it all felt back then. Eh well, hopefully I'll have it again with someone else relatively soon, so my brain can lock all this other crap away for good.

I just noticed I use the word ""cuz"" a lot. Cuz it's a good word, goddamit.

Fortunately though, I have some really good friends. Tonight alone, I talked to Steve, Stump, David, Swarup, and Jeremy. I just now finished chatting with Jeremy (what was he doing up at 6am Michigan time? getting drunk, of course). I just wanted to say that it feels pretty damn good knowing that there are people out there who truly enjoy your company and wish you were there to share good times with them. My friends are fucking awesome. So, it seems that I'm gonna try to be in Michigan for Halloween, and then Steve is gonna try to be in El Paso sometime in November. I would be ultra-excited right now, except we all know about my previous attempts to go vacationing (sigh), and Steve isn't 100% sure he can come down. Either way though, it's nice to have hope of seeing some of the people who matter most to me.

Just a few brain-teasers for y'all. I guess that's my way of saying that I'm not dead yet, despite my long LJ-absence; I've just been horrendously busy lately. ""Busy doing what?"" Eh, stuff. Leadership School, work, preparing for my future, random shit like that. Not in the mood for specifics right now.

News Flash Update: My mom's b-day is on Friday. Still have no idea what we're getting her (she wants either a digital camera or an IPod). Still have no idea where we're taking her. Shit, I guess I oughta chat with my dad tomorrow to see what's up. Not too worried tho; we always pull something outta our asses somehow.

Apparently, I'm just not in a typing mood tonite, so bye for now. Peace"

Credit: Reposted from <lj user = lesslikeyou>, who got it from <lj user = charshark>, who got it from <lj user = neitherday>, who got this from <lj user = unseelie>, whom found it through <lj user = chaoticerotic>. 

In September 1999, Hurricane Floyd -- a category 3 -- was bearing down the Carolinas and Virginia.

President Clinton was in Christchurch, New Zealand - meeting with President Jiang of China (you know, actually working). He made the proclamation that only Presidents can make and declared the areas affected by Floyd ""Federal Disaster Areas"" so the National Guard and Military can begin to mobilize. Then he cut short his meetings overseas and flew home to coordinate the rescue efforts. This all one day BEFORE a Cat-3 hit the coast. That is how you do it.

How about this dope's own father during Hurricane Andrew? Once again, President Bush (41) -- August, 1992 -- was in the midst of a brutal campaign for re-election. Yet, he cut off his campaigning the day before and went to Washington where he martialed the largest military operation on US soil in history. He sent in 7,000 National Guard and 22,000 regular military personnel, and all the gear to begin the clean up within hours after Andrew passed through Florida. 'Cause, you know, those people and their stuff was actually where it belonged, rather than being used for insurgent target-practice halfway around the world in a vain effort to make Iraq safe for Iranian takeover.

In August of 1969 when Cat-5 Hurricane Camille hit roughly the same area as Katrina, President Nixon had already readied the National Guard and ordered all Gulf rescue vessels and equipment from Tampa and Houston to follow the Hurricane in. There were over 1,000 regular military with two dozen helicopters to assist the Coast Guard and National Guard within hours after the skies cleared.

Bush 43 - August 2005 - Cat-5 Hurricane Katrina bears down on New Orleans and the Mississippi gulf. Both states are down nearly 8,000 National Guard troops because they are in Iraq -- with most of the rescue gear needed. Bush is on vacation. The day before Katrina makes landfall, Bush rides his bike for two hours. The day she hits, he goes to Johnnie McCain's birthday party; and lies to old people about the multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical company welfare boondoggle. People are dying, the largest port of entry in the United States (and fifth largest in the World) is under attack. Troops and supplies are desperately needed. The levees are cracking and the emergency 1-1/2 ton sandbags are ready, but there aren't enough helicopters or pilots to set them before the levees fail. The mayor of New Orleans begs for Federal coordination, but there is none, and the sandbagging never gets done. So Bush -- naturally -- goes to San Diego to play guitar with country singer and lie to the military about how Iraq is just exactly like WWII. The levees give way, filling New Orleans with water, sewage, oil and chemicals. Ten percent of all US exports, and 50% of all agricultural exports ordinarly go through this port. It is totally destroyed. Bush decides he'll end his vacation a couple of days early --BECAUSE HE HAS TICKETS TO A PADRES GAME! He goes back to the Fake Farm in Crawford, with every intention of doing something on WEDNESDAY about this disaster that happened starting last Sunday night.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Man, it pisses me off that this asstard is from the same state as I am. If only it was possible to elect presidents to 3rd and 4th and 5th terms; then we could bring back the guy who actually knew how to do his job. And other jobs as well, if you know what I mean. ;)

"event","Stump's b-day party = one huge muddafukkin good time. Most fun I've had in 3 months. Interesting little factoids for ya:

<lj-cut text=""Shut up, you fat ass!"">Number of people at party (excluding his parents): 13

Number of engineering students at party: 13

Number of UTEP students at party: 12 (guess which person is not included...)

Weirdest coincidence: <i>Every single person</i> brought a case of Smirnoff Ice, so that we eventually ended up with all of the flavors, plus some

Horniest mammal at party: Charlie, Stump's pet poodle. Charlie spent the entire night trying to hump Stump's other dog, Beauty. Problem was, Charlie is approximately the size of a cat, whereas Beauty is normal-doggy sized, so Charlie's little doggy unit couldn't quite reach Beauty's normal-doggy hole. That certainly didn't stop him from trying though; he kept at it from the time we walked in, to the time when we finally left. Twas good entertainment.

Best moment of the night: Stump's jumping around on the trampoline, when suddenly we hear a POP and he's not jumping around anymore. The rest of us, in slightly different stages of drunkenness, kinda stare at him for 15 seconds trying to figure out why he never bounced back up. Finally, we notice that one of his legs is sticking out from underneath, and someone goes, ""Stump, did your fat ass just break your trampoline?"" Instant classic.</lj-cut>


I just finished watching ""Guess Who,"" with Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. Pretty damn funny. Funniest black joke I've heard in a long time: ""How do we know that Adam and Eve weren't black? Uh, have you ever tried to take a rib away from a black man?"" LOL, oh it's true, oh it's true."

"event","We went and saw 2 movies tonight (free, of course... we even snuck in some Arby's); they were ""Red Eye"" and ""Four Brothers"". Red Eye was OK, not awesome or anything but entertaining at times. Meanwhile, Four Brothers was damn good; who knew that Andre 3000 could actually ACT??? I got all excited in the beginning when they showed shots of random buildings and I immediately realized that they were in Detroit. I was like, ""Hells yeah, I've been there! I stood in that spot once!"" It was almost as good as seeing shots of El Paso in ""Man on Fire"". But yeah, the movie was good. 2 thumbs up.

So, last night I noticed that Hammers had written on my facebook wall, so I started scanning through all of my friends' profiles to see what everyone was up to. I was feelin all nostalgic and stuff, remembering good times, til I got down to my first ex, Priya (yes, we are on eachother's friends list...surprising, I know). I click on her, and the first thing I notice is that she's in a relationship now. Well, at that point, I felt a faint little twinge in my heart but nothing really serious, so I go ahead and click on the new guy's name. Well, Darnell, <lj-cut text =""welcome to the Twilight Zone..."">welcome to the Twilight Zone... The dude is <i>an exact replica of me</i>. People, I kid you not: he's black, an engineer, has Caribbean ancestry, works in a dorm cafeteria (which is what I was doing when I first met Priya), last name starts with a W... shit, if he let his hair, beard, and mustache grow out a little more, he would even look <b>exactly</b> like me. Lemme tell ya, that weirded me the fuck out, to the max. I know the phrase ""once you go black, you never go back,"" but good lord, i think that's taking it a bit too far. Seriously, I was so freaked out that I turned off the computer and laid in bed, feeling utterly wretched until I fell asleep. When I woke up this morning, I felt fine until I remembered it all, and then I felt sick all over again. You're probably thinking that I was actually feeling immense jealousy, and to be honest, I'm not 100% sure that that's untrue, but it's odd because when Kel (ex #2) found a new boyfriend and was rubbing him in my face everytime she saw me, I can honestly say that I didn't give a shit. Hell, if someone walked up to me right now and told me they were still together, I STILL wouldn't give a shit. So why all this angst over Priya and the Mini-Me? Well, I think it's mostly because this affirms that our break-up really didn't have anything to do with me personally, and that if I had gone back to her when she wanted me to, instead of wasting my time on Kel, everything might have actually worked out OK with us. I mean, if she's satisfied with a clone, then how much more so would she be with the real thing? God, why couldn't she be dating some Indian dude or even a Michigan redneck instead? But fortunately, my head's clearer now and I'm completely cool with it, cuz hey, the past is the past and there's nothing I can do about it. I kinda find it funny now actually. Hehe, DAMN, I musta been goooooood. :-P 

...What I need to do is get the fuck out of El Paso and get myself a life, so I can be busy enough not to bother myself with stupid shit like this. Working on it...</lj-cut>

Anyway, Stump's 21st b-day is tomorrow, and we all know what THAT means. So, I gotta go rest up for what promises to be an extraordinarily good time.

Alrite, peace and out..."

I started to get all excited and pumped up, like ""yeah, school's starting again, woohoo!!!!"" Then I remembered that I'm done with all that, and I became completely bummed out. I think it just kinda hit me that <lj-cut text=""I'm actually gonna miss random shit, and that sux"">I'm going to miss college a whole lot more than I expected. College football has been brought up a lot during chats with random folk, and I'm always going on about ""Wolverine football this"" and ""Michigan football that"", but I doubt I'll ever be able to go back to the Big House and watch a Michigan game anytime in the next decade or so. This mades me vewy vewy sad. I'm gonna miss the Friday night beer pong parties, and then waking up with a slight hangover Saturday morning to the sounds of people trying to find parking on our front lawn and the annoying dude next door yelling stupid shit at all of them through his bullhorn. I'm gonna miss being able to get together with 5-10 friends and going crazy as our Maize 'n' Blue give hell to some random Big Ten team. I'm gonna miss the Saturday night victory parties, with an air of comraderie and drunkenness all over the place, and then waking up with a slightly larger hangover Sunday morning and realizing that I have 10000 tons of homework to get done in 24-or-less hours. OK, maybe I won't miss that last part, but that's not the point. Point is, that's actually just a small portion of what I'm going to be missing about college life. I only take comfort in the fact that I now know where I'm going in life and have at least 2 definite careers lined up for myself in the near future. Looks like I'm gonna hafta wait a little longer to see if my preferred one is gonna pan out, but my expectations are rather high. You'll all get the news next month. Either way, I will eventually be making decent money, and then I will be able to afford to 1) move somewhere else, 2) take full control of my own life, and 3) start truly enjoying it. The only question I'll have then is HOW to enjoy my life, but I'm sure I'll be able to figure something out. I can be somewhat creative when I need to be.

My sister and I were chatting about our earlier childhood together today, and we started laughing about how very <i>opposite</i> we always were. She was a hyper, energetic drama queen with a vivid imagination, and I was a reclusive computer geek who avoided social interaction like a plague of leprosy and AIDS combined. Therefore, our interactions sometimes went as follows:

Ebony: Here D, have a yummy cup of tea with me!
Me: Eb, the only thing in this teacup is water...
Eb: But, it's the tastiest water you'll ever have! Come on, drink with me and Mr. Ruffskin. [She had 50 stuffed animals, each with a different name.]
Me: No, water always tastes like water, which doesn't actually have any taste, and if you try to give any to your bear, he'll just get all wet and soggy.
Eb: Well then, how about some cake?
Me: Eb, there's nothing on that plate.
Eb: It's invisible cake.
Me: Uh yeah, sure...I think I'll pass.
Eb: Geez, you really suck, you party-pooper.
Me: Shut up and let me get back to my computer game already.

You know, that actually doesn't sound too much different from how I talk to her nowadays. I guess some things never change. Anyway, she's going off to Faith Master's Commission (or as she calls it, ""bible school on steroids"") in 2 weeks, and I'm beginning to imagine that I might miss her too. For most of my life, I've always been able to count on the fact that, no matter where I've been and what I've done, I can look forward to coming home to someone that practically worships me, someone who gets every single joke that comes out of my mouth, someone who will randomly hug me and say ""I love you"" no matter what I've said or done to her in the last 3 hours. Now, that someone won't be here for 9 months. If I was the crying type of guy, I think I might be sniffling right now. But, I guess it's the least I can endure after abandoning her here for 5 straight years. Besides, she can the most annoying little brat on the face of the earth sometimes. Shit, what the hell am I talking about; I'm gonna have a fucking blast without her. Uhhuh, yeah, that's right...*sniffles*</lj-cut>

Tough beans for you. Instead, I've decided to give y'all a big News Update:

I will be back in Ann Arbor by the end of this month, to say all my final goodbyes. Yes, I know that I already took a road trip there and left with all my shit and everything, but at the time, the only good friend of mine that was there was Swarup. Now, Feinstein's back from Israel, DelMastro is visiting from Rochester for Welcome Week (him and Feinstein both called me up last week to see what I was up to, which was pretty cool), Hammers will be back from Midland, and Satish will DEFINITELY be down for drunken good times. Satish miss Welcome Week parties? That's like me passing up free food. So yeah, I defnitly need to have one last shindig with all my peeps. Actually, that's all just a secondary reason for why I'm going back up there, but it's too early to share Reason Numero Uno with you all; hopefully, I'll be able to spill the beans about that next month.

Meanwhile, I'm signing up for Leadership School at my family's church. OK, you can stop laughing now; I think I'd make a pretty damn good leader, thank you. I would just, uh, need a reason to lead people. Yeah, that's the ticket. Anyway, it begins September 11, and I'm kinda apprehensive about the whole thing. I get enough Jesus shoved down my throat here at home, I don't think I can stand 3 months of having extra helpings of Holy Trinity in a classroom setting. But, I guess we'll see how it goes...

Oh, and my new Music Discovery of the Month is Fatty Koo. This group is really, really fucking sweet; I liked <i><u>every</u> <u>single</u> <u>song</u></i> on their first album, which is a bit of a rarity for me. I didn't even like all the songs on ""Elephunk"" or ""The Marshall Mathers LP"", two of my all-time favorites. I'd suggest that you all try out a song or 2, but I realize that most of the people who read my LJ are hip indie-band lovers, so nevermind. BTW, if anyone has any good bands/artists you think <i>I</i> should try, defnitly let me know, cuz I'm open to pretty much every single type of music except country. Sorry, I just don't get off listening to a guy sing about his dead puppy that got ran over by his fiancee that left him at the altar for some rich movie executive.

And th-th-th-th-that's all, folks!"

"event","I just realized that I've only been updating once a week now. Yep, that's about how often interesting things happen to me now. Wait, no, correction: that's how often GOOD interesting things happen to me. For instance, on Saturday, we were at Lowe's looking for a tree to stick in our front yard; I'm walking around a corner, the wind blows, and suddenly, BLAM, a tree falls over and lands perfectly on my face. So now, I'm sporting a rather fierce-lookin scratch underneath my right eye, making me look truly thug-gangsta. Yup, if that's not a sign that god hates me, I don't know what is; how many people do YOU know have had trees randomly fall on their heads? Yeah, that's what I thought.

Anyway, other than the Attack of the Killer Tree, the weekend was purty good. <lj-cut text=""But, I won't bore you to death with shitty details. I'm sure I can find something cooler to bore you to death with..."">Friday night, my sister and I got into the movies for free as usual, this time with my good friend David. That was my treat to him, as repayment for ditching him twice in the past week. My sister saw ""Sky High"" and liked it; meanwhile, David and I saw ""Wedding Crashers"" and, well, <b>I</b> thought it was hilarious. Vince Vaughn is definitely on my current Favorite Actors list. David, on the other hand, thought it was boring; I guess computer engineers don't agree on EVERYTHING. Saturday night, David, Stump, and I went bowling, and I completely creamed their asses. It was odd, cuz half the time I was only fucking around, but it was like no matter how I threw the ball, it'd hit something. One time, I literally <i>tossed</i> the ball halfway down the lane, and yet I STILL got a strike. Yup, it was definitely one of my best games ever. Afterwards, we went to Whataburger and generally made fun of eachother. It was mad good times. Stump and David have been my best friends longer than anyone else on this earth, and I'm glad that my 5-year absence from EP didn't weaken that friendship in any way. It makes me wonder: what would have happened if I had just stayed my ass here and went to UTEP, instead of Michigan? It would have been a whole shitload cheaper, especially if I had kept living at home (which I probably woulda done), and plus I would have made many more friends right here in good ol' El Pisso. But then I realize that I would have missed out on quite an amazing and eye-opening experience in A2, and I'd be just like every single other El Pasoan on earth: ignorant and satisfied with their meager lot in life. Not that that's necessarily bad, for I love how that makes EP such a chill and relaxed city, but it's definitely not what's going to raise me to the heights of greatness that I expect for my life. Conceited, yes I know, but if I don't think highly of my own self, then who will?

A question I've always enjoyed asking others is this: If you could live anywhere on earth, where would you live? [Feel free to answer in the comments or in your own LJ, if you wish.] I used to have a Top 5 list of countries I would reside in (Australia, Japan, Italy, Brazil, and Trinidad, in that order), but I've recently come to realize that, though these would be cool places to <i>visit</i>, they wouldn't be ideal for me to actually spend the rest of my life in. Nope, I'll just stick to my plan of settling down in southeastern Texas, i.e. the San Antonio-Houston-Austin area. I guess I just can't pull myself away from this loud, arrogant state of mine, so I might as well keep it as my permanent home. Besides, everyone knows that the further south you go, the hotter the girls get. hehehe ;)</lj-cut>"

I'm kinda down right now because 1) <lj-cut text=""I'm a shitty friend"">I had called up David earlier today (er, yesterday, Saturday), told him we'd hang out that night, and then I ended up watching TV with my folks and thus didn't get his repeated phone calls. One thing I've always prided myself in is extreme loyalty to all my true friends (not to be confused with people I'll occasionally hang out with, but don't really give 2 shits about), so it irks me when I leave one out in the cold like that. But it's cool, David is perhaps the mellowest person in the universe, I once lost $200 worth of his Magic cards and he just shrugged it off, so he'll get over it swiftly. Otherwise, he'd probably have ditched my ass long ago. :-P</lj-cut>

2) <lj-cut text=""Where my peeps at?"">Feelin a bit lonesome. I haven't met anyone new for the last month or so, and it's starting to get to me again. I've had opportunities, but they're so far and few in between. My parents are desperately trying to hook me up with this (very hot) girl at church, which is cool of them and all, but I'm just not feelin it. I have no idea why though; it's probably because I didn't try for her on my own or something stupid like that. Anyway, it's very sucktastic that I almost never have interaction with people outside of church, which leads me to the next issue...</lj-cut>

3) <lj-cut text=""El Paso is the vacuum of my soul."">I was just reflecting about how I'd either be in a drunken coma in my bed or in a drunken coma on someone's couch right now if I was still in Ann Arbor. Or if I was anywhere else in the universe, for that matter. But if I tried any shit like that here in EP, my folks would be all over me like starving dogs on a fat juicy T-bone steak. That's what ultimately drove me from EP in the first place (parental suffocation), and it's what's gonna drive me away again this time. I love my fam to death, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna let them stand in the way of me living my life. So this week, Operation Get Out Of Doggone El Paso is officially in effect. I actually started that process last week, but only halfheartedly. Now, I'll hopefully be able to get the proper paperwork out and start the ball rolling for... well, I'm saving that as a surprise for y'all (although you've probably already figured it out, Steve. You have a bad habit of doing that :-P).</lj-cut>

"event","Is it just me, or has everyone gotten really horny lately? <lj-cut text=""Except the Virgin Trish, of course."">Lemme explain: Friday night, Stump and I were invited to eat dinner at Mike's house. Mike is an old high-school friend of ours, and I remember him best as having one of the dirtiest minds in existence. So, we show up at his place, and we're immediately given bottles of Smirnoff Ice by his mother... first clue that I'm in for an interesting time. Actually, everything went along quite normal-ish, until the meal began. We started off by saying grace (as in, Mike's mom stood up, said the word ""Grace"", and sat back down), and then within 5 minutes, we were talking about ass-less pants and crotch-less underwear. Conversation didn't stray too far from sex-related topics throughout dinner, and even the task of cleaning up the table afterwards carried sexual innuendo. Example:

Mike's Dad: Mike and Scott [Mike's brother], combine those two plates of chicken and hot dogs.
Mike: Sweet, you get to stick your meat into my junk!
Scott: Alright, are you ready for my fat weiner yet?
Mike: Hell yeah, shove that sausage right over here!
Scott: Do you think I can fit it all in?
Mike: Sure, let me just spread these legs further apart...

Of course, he meant <i>chicken</i> legs, but it was still fucking hilarious. After we left, Stump asks, ""so how do you think YOUR folks would have reacted to dinner conversation like that?"" to which I responded ""they would have been too shocked to do anything for a week, and then they'd slaughter us both and bury us in the backyard."" I thought this was a fairly accurate assessment, but they later proved me wrong. My mom was helping me unpack some stuff from A2 when we stumbled upon my bottle of lube and my pineapple-flavored massage oil. Mom picks them up, looks at the lube, and the conversation goes as follows:

Mom: Where'd you get THIS from?
Me: Uh, Kel gave it to me as a present on Valentine's Day.
Mom: What did you need it for? Isn't Kelly a virgin?
Me: Err... um... uh, no.
*Whack!*
Me: Ow! what was that for?
Mom: For being a bad guy! Shame on you! Taking not one, but TWO girls' virginity! Shame!
Me: Well, actually, Kel wasn't... uh, nevermind. Hey, where are you going with those bottles?
Mom: These should come in handy for me and my husband tonight. It's not like you'll be needing them any time soon anyway...

Gag. So yeah, my parents are now in possession of my lube and massage oil, with definite plans on using them. A conversation we had later on went something like this:

Dad: Oooo yeah, looks like we're gonna be having some fun tonight!
Mom: Shhhh, your kids can hear you!
Dad: Uh, they're not quite kids anymore; I'm sure they don't think that their parents are still virgins.
Mom: Of course they do! Dee, don't you think I'm a virgin?
Me: Oh yeah, definitely; first, there was the Virgin Mary, and now there's the Virgin Trish. [My mom's name is Trish, just in case you didn't pick that up.]

All this kinda alters my view of my parental units, but not by much. It just means that they're somewhat more comfortable talking about sex with their children than I expected. But that doesn't mean I can ask them for sex tips or anything like that; six feet under our backyard isn't the best place to spend eternity.</lj-cut>"

Maybe I'll be more up for it when I finally get my computer from the post office tomorrow (I'm currently using my sister's shitty old Stone Age comp). It's been there since Tuesday, but the truck was still dead and everyone else was too busy to loan me their cars. Fortunately, the son of one of my mom's clients works on cars a lot, so he came over today and checked it out. We spent 3 hours going through all of the wiring to find the problem, to no avail, and then he simply cleaned off the battery and, whammo-presto, the truck roars back to life. The Problem: Dirt had gotten between the ground wire and the battery, causing the system to be improperly grounded and thus sending too much voltage through the fuel ignition system whenever the truck was started, bursting the ignition fuse. In simpler terms, the engine of the truck was too fucking dirty and just needed a good cleaning. That's what happens when you've never gotten your vehicle serviced or maintenanced after you got it 7 years ago, DAD. Man, I can't wait until that truck officially becomes mine; Chewy (the guy who fixed it) said he'd help me retro-fit it and soup it up. Don't worry, if we turn it into the ultimate old-school lowrider, I'll be sure to take many, many pictures to post on here.

Funny incident that happened a few days ago: My friend Stump comes by to return our key (he had been taking care of our pet parrot while we were gone), my folks start talking religion to him, and suddenly he finds himself invited to come with us to church this Sunday. Stump surprisingly agrees, even though he hasn't gone to church in two and a half years. When it's just the two of us again, outside by his truck where my folks can't hear us, I ask him why he agreed to come. His answer: ""I've always wanted to see what makes religious folks all fucked up like that, so I figured I might as well start at your church."" LOL. I guess I better briefly explain my view of religion to y'all so you don't get the wrong impression: I believe that there MAY be a God, or that there may be SEVERAL gods, but I don't believe that Jesus Christ is one of them. I also think that people who believe that their personal religion is the only way to heaven, are ignorant dipshits who deserve to roast in hell for eternity, if there is a heaven and hell. Why would you want heaven to exclude people who have never even HEARD of your religion, but still try to live good, high-moral lives? Argh, stupid fucking uber-fanatics. /end-rant... Anyway, Stump now gets to wake up at 8AM this Sunday to accompany us to church. This doesn't sit too well with him, since he's infamous for not getting up til 2PM unless he absolutely has to, but he's put a good face to it all, so all's good.

Well, that was certainly a lot for not wanting to update. I'd hate to see what happens after I get my computer and decide that I actually feel like updating."

"event","Well, I'm back from the Road Trip of Utter Doom and, wooooo, it was a doozy. <lj-cut text=""This is one huge mofo of an update, so I hope you have time to read a novel or 2..."">I knew it was going to be <strike>pretty fucked up</strike> <strike>completely and totally screwed</strike> veeerrrrrrryy different when we started off by taking a single wrong turn in New Mexico and ended up 100 miles off-path in Roswell. [Sidenote: despite all the UFO landings and shit, Roswell is really just an average NM town. Rather disappointing.] My parents have got to be the worst navigators/direction followers I've ever met in my entire life. I never realized how lucky I was to have Steve the Walking GPS System on my previous roadtrip, until now. I swear, while coming back from Detroit, I told them to take I-94 all the way back to Ann Arbor, went to sleep, and woke up with us lost, halfway to Flint. How the fuck do you mess up directions from Detroit to A2? All you have to do is stay on one fucking highway!!! Le sigh. So yeah, I had to basically guide us through every single mile on the way to Michigan and back, but I got to drive most of the way, so it worked out OK. Over the course of the trip, we visited (meaning, we at least stopped and saw a monument in] 10 different cities across America: Roswell, Oklahoma City, St. Louis, Chicago, Ann Arbor, Detroit, Windsor, Indianapolis, Memphis, and Little Rock. Some awards I want to give out real quick:

State with the worst roads: Michigan (you know you can't deny it)
State with the best roads: Texas (no, I'm not being biased, they really were the best)
City with the most hick-farmer accents: Memphis
City with the rudest people: toss-up between Chicago and Detroit
City with the friendliest folk: Texarkana (we briefly stopped there to eat, and was greeted kindly by every single person we passed by. Man, I love Texas.)
City that's easiest to feel claustrophobia in: Chicago
City with the shittiest downtown: Memphis
City with the most impressive downtown: Chicago by sheer size, Indianapolis by sheer quality

There's plenty more, but I'll just have to add them when I think of them. Anyway, it was all more fun than I originally expected; the family turned out to be rather nice to chat with, despite their continuous preaching of God's Word. It felt good to talk about my whole Michigan experience, from the cutthroat atmosphere to the bitterly cold weather to my horrid choice in women. Well, that last one isn't quite true; I told my sister on the way back that I could no longer say anything bad about my exes, because despite the heartache, drama, and torment that both of them put me through, they were truly good girls deep down inside, and we just happened to mesh really badly. At least, that was the case with Kel and I; I'm still not quite sure what happened with Priya, and it looks like I'll never find out. Sometimes, I sorely miss that girl that I worshipped like a goddess for an entire year, but I've come to realize that that was probably more puppy-love than any true connection. As for Kel...well, that was one very complicated mess of a relationship. We had a lot goin for us, but there was so much more that was similar to butting my head against a brick wall. However, I must be honest and say that my own bull-headed stubbornness and lack of maturity was about 70% of the reason why we broke off like we did. Does that mean I'd want a 2nd chance with her? HELLS NO; if I had been thinking clearly way back when, I wouldn't have gotten together with her in the first place. I would elaborate, but I just said that I wouldn't say anything bad about her anymore. What I CAN say is that she was definitely the more mature of the 2 exes, and I certainly learned a lot from dating her. I just hope that she's doing well with Adam or whoever, cuz despite the many times I've described her as a shitty person, I know that she truly deserves better than what I gave her.

So yeah, I got a lot out of Michigan. I've developed the ability to adapt to any environment I'm ever in; I've encountered totally different cultures, thus deeply broadening my view of the world; I've gone through two fucked-up relationships and learned from them. I now know what it's like to struggle, to be utterly penniless, to starve, to be discriminated against, and to feel complete shame over who I am and how I act. Michigan took everything that I feared and despised on this earth, and threw it at me with full force; yet I dealt with it all and came out victorious, and will be able to do so again (with much more ease and rapidity) in the future. The roadtrip kinda helped in realizing all this, and thus I'm no longer upset about having to bring my parents along. Although, I'm sure I woulda had WAAAAAAYYYYY more fun without them, but hey, shit happens. Flush the toilet and keep moving. Peace."

"event","Howdy, folks, didja miss me? Prolly not, but fortunately I don't really care. Anyway, I've got quite a bit to update, and not much time to do it in (as in, I'll prolly pass out from exhaustion in approx. 10 mins), so <lj-cut text=""here we go..."">here we go:

Earlier this week, my parents realized that they didn't want me and my sister going to Michigan by ourselves, ever, so they conveniently decided that they needed a vacation too, and that there was no better place to visit than Ann Arbor? Hence, we now have a full family roadtrip to Michigan planned for 4th of July weekend. And we're only bringing one car, of course, so wherever Darnell goes in Ann Arbor, his entire family goes too. Thanks for flushing all of my party-and-fun plans down the fucking toilet, guys, hope you're proud of yourselves. However, despite having my Brother/Sister Roadtrip of Complete Craziness turned into the Family Roadtrip of Senseless Sanity, I might manage to do something interesting anyway. We're taking 2 separate routes to and from Ann Arbor (El Paso-OK City-Tulsa-St. Louis-Chicago to A2, then A2-Indianapolis-Memphis-Little Rock-Dallas back to EP), and I have full control over where we go and what we do on the trip, so there's ample opportunity to invent some parent-approved lunacy. I just didn't want my folks along for my last visit to the state that has tormented me for the past 5 years, but I guess you can't get everything you want in life. And no Steve, there's no way in hell my folks are gonna be up for visiting NJ along the way; trust me, I already ran it by them, and it was immediately shot down in horrific flames. Sorry, bro.

Meanwhile, I decided that I desperately needed more social interaction, so I volunteered to work in the bookstore at my family's church. I figure, what better place to meet <strike>babes</strike> <strike>hotties</strike> new interesting people than at church? That way, no matter who I meet, it's automatically parent-sanctioned. Plus, I get an endless source of books to consume my times of boredom; the only way this deal could get any better is if I was gettin paid.

OK, you all remember my pledge to do something wild and crazy this week, right? Well, apparently god also remembered that pledge, cuz he did his absolute utmost to keep me from even getting the chance to attempt something stupid. You see, I was invited to John's going away party on Saturday, which provided me with a prime opportunity to get utterly plastered for the night. First obstacle: getting there without having to drag my sister along. Usually, I'm fine with taking her practically wherever I go, but I'd rather not have her see me drunk for another few years. [Sidenote: I'm re-reading this and realizing that it's kinda pathetic that a 23-y.o. guy is forced to take his 18-y.o. sister ANYWHERE, and that said 23-y.o. guy still can't be up-front with his family about his particular enjoyment of alcoholic beverages. Goddamn uber-Christian parents. Damn them all to hell.] I cleared Obstacle #1 by sneaking off in the truck while sis was out buying batteries with dad, but then Obstacle #2 occurs: truck just randomly dies half-a-mile away from my house. WTF, this truck has run just fine for the past 5 years, only to commit suicide while Darnell's trying to go out and have fun for a change. God hates me. So, I call up Stump and my dad, pop the hood, and together the 3 of us try to find and fix the problem. As I write this, the problem STILL hasn't been found, much less fixed. Anyway, we use dad's car to tow the truck back home, and then he drops me off at the party. Obstacle #3: Convincing the father that the death of the truck wasn't a ""sign from God"" indicating that I shouldn't go to the party. No Dad, it was a sign from the truck saying that it was a piece of shit..</lj-cut>

"event","Just saw ""Batman Begins""; twas purty good. What I liked most about it is that, while it was doing the whole prequel-to-the-other-Batman-movies thing, it was also driving in this fight-your-fears theme the entire time. Thus, while it was all action-packed and fun to watch, it also gave you something to think about and perhaps learn from. Niiiiiice. You don't get much of that nowadays.

Tonight was an excellent night because we were able to eat AND go to the movies<lj-cut text=""the way that god meant us to go...""> for free. Yeah, that's right, for FREE. It began with my sister Ebony and I going to Taco Smell to grab some yummy pseudo-Mexican food. We started off by ordering 4 Burrito Supremes and a soft taco, but Stump had said earlier that he'd be joining us, so I decided to do the best-buddies thing and add on a bean burrito to our order for him. I paid $8.62 to the register boy (who seemed to be brand new to the job), took some water cups, got me some rather fizzy water called Sprite from the soda fountain, and sat down to wait. As Stump arrived, Register Boy came out with what was supposed to be our food; however, we hadn't ordered 4 grilled stuffed burritos, and we seemed to be missing a taco and a bean burrito. So Ebony (who enjoys causing trouble) takes the food back up to the counter and demands that we get our actual order. We all chat and joke around together for another 5 minutes, and then Register Boy comes back again... with 4 grilled stuffed burritos. Highly un-amused, I personally go back up and calmly explain that I didn't order grilled stuff burritos, I didn't WANT any goddamn stuffed burritos, and I just wanted my fucking Burrito Supremes, taco, and normal bean burrito. Manager Woman comes out, apologizes, and tells someone to give me back my money. Someone hands me cash, I go back to our table, and then realize that I was given $7.71. WTF??? This time, Ebony goes back up, and comes back with $8.62 and four grilled stuffed burritos. ""Again???"" ""No no, I just thought that we deserved these too."" Stump and I fully agreed, so we kept those, and Register Boy finally got us our Burrito Supremes, plus taco and bean burrito. 9 burritos and a taco, all for free. Hells yeah, baby, hells yeah.

Then, we decided to hit up the movies. Eb has a friend at a nearby theater who usually lets us in for free, so of course we headed to that one. We walked in, all confident and shit, only to find a police officer standing in the spot that our ""connection"" usually stands in. With Plan A shot to pieces, Stump and I contemplated Plans B (Bash the cop in the head and run in), C (pay actual Cash), and D (Ditch the movies and go home). Meanwhile, Ebony disappeared to work on her own private plan; she snuck into the theater on the pretext of having to use the bathroom, and then went to work on the inside. Fifteen minutes later, she reappears behind us and leads us to an exit at the side of the building, where she had apparently used her girlish charms to coax some unwitting dumbass into holding the door open for us. Thus we executed Plan E (Enter through the Exit with Ebony's help) and got to see ""Batman Begins"" for free without even using our connection. I guess my sister is useful for something after all.</lj-cut>

So anyway, it was a good night. Not having to pay for anything just makes everything seem so much more enjoyable. Like I always say, ""if it's for free, it's for me."" Nite, folks."

<u>Three things a person should never attempt without expecting dire consequences</u>

1. Never go shopping for Father's Day with females unless you want conversations like this:
Mom: Should we get Dad these golf shoes to go with his new golf clubs and golf balls?
Me: No, you really only need tennis shoes to go golfing.
Mom: But, your father deserves to golf in some golf shoes!
Me: Fine, then let's get him these shoes.
Mom: I don't like these shoes all that much, won't we be able to find better ones at the golf shop?
Me: OK, let's go to the golf shop and get him some shoes.
Mom: But these ones here are only $40, maybe we should just get these...
Me: No, let's go to the golf shop and check out what they have.
Mom: Does your dad even <i>need</i> golf shoes to go golfing?
*head meets wall, repeatedly*

2. Don't try to clear up a problem with your iPAQ Pocket PC by pulling out the battery while it's on, unless you have a particular urge to wipe out everything on the system. (And especially don't if all your original software is 1000 miles away.)

3. Don't tell a good friend of yours that you want to see the Pistons put up a stronger fight in the NBA Finals, unless you're prepared to see them blow out your favorite team by 15 and then 30 points (you can stop gloating now, <lj user=""mike_coop""> and <lj user=""lesslikeyou"">)."

"event","Well, good news and bad news. I guess I'll start with the good news because it's mad shorter and easier to explain.

<lj-cut text=""The Good, The Bad, and the Oooogly"">The Good: I have a job now... kinda. Apparently, the person who runs the Business Impact Center at New York Life (the company my parents work for) has the preggers, so they need someone to help/cover for her while she's busy popping out a nice little bundle of terror. Incidently, I ran the BIC myself for an entire summer 3 years ago, and well, here I am, broke and jobless. Fate couldn't have worked it out any better. It'll most likely only be part-time, but that's cool cuz that means I'll still have time to help my mom out and whatnot.

The Bad: I'm starting to get that caged-and-locked-up feeling I always get after spending 2 weeks in El Paso. In Michigan, I'm used to going to work, talking and laughing with at least 10 people I'd never seen before, going home, chatting with some random bum along the way, going to a party later that night, meeting 20 cool new peeps, getting 3 or 4 phone numbers, maybe making out with a random girl, and then doing it all over again the next day. Here in EP, I really don't do shit other than get dragged around by my folks all day long. Don't get me wrong, I love my fam like nothing else, and yes, I was gloating about how they absolutely adore me in my last LJ entry, but now they're starting to get a tad bit smothering. Like a fucking wool blanket, in fact. Especially my mother, which was initially understandable because I am her only son (and a mama's boy at that), but now it's to the point where she wants me around practically 24 hours a day. Seriously, I think she'd let me sleep in her bed too, if she thought my dad would go for it. Thus, I have to accomplish a freakin James Bond act in order to escape and hang with my friends, and even then, it's not like I can go out to a club somewhere, get drunk, and come back at 3am; the Momster already thinks I've ""turned away from the Christian path,"" causing her to spend most of her time preaching to me, so I'd rather not give her more fodder. But frankly, I'm sick and tired of seeing the same old faces every single goddamn day. I need my fresh load of 20 new peeps every week, and I'm definitely not gonna get it with my mom pulling me around by my hand everywhere. I'm gonna hafta think of a way to claim more Darnell time for myself, or else I might just explode in a very bad way. Wish me luck.

The Ugly: OK, not ugly at all, but quite interesting. Here's a list of all my closest friends on earth (excluding my family), in descending order:
Steve
Stump
Slava
David
Dan (Feinstein)
Jeremy (Hammers)
Jegan

What does that spell? SDJ trio, baby! But, wait, it's not just one name per letter, it's 2 or 3! And it's in order of how close to them I am, so the letter groupings are completely unintentional! Freakin odd man, freakin odd. But goddamn, I miss the SDJ trio; those were good times. I probably just need to find a J-person down here to solve my lonesome blues and resurrect my havoc-reeking nature. Whoever it is, better show up pretty fucking soon. Peace</lj-cut>"

Brad Pitt has had my eternal respect since ""Fight Club"" and Angelina... oh, Angelina... could God have made a more perfect woman? Cat eyes, luscious lips, exotic face, perfect breasts, and a body that makes me drool everytime I see it; I'm creaming myself just thinking about her. Uh, anyway, go see the movie, you should all like it, even if you don't have a <strike>secret</strike> <strike>not-so-secret</strike> rather infamous Angelina Jolie fetish.

In other news, I'm momentarily happy with life. Earlier this week, I went slightly batty because I woke up that morning and realized that I'm 23, I have no job (which reminds me, I gotta inform Panera tomorrow that I'm not coming back anytime soon), I have no money because of said lack of job, and I'm currently living in my parents' house. Holy shitcakes, Batman, I've turned into a pathetic loser overnight! So, I ran to my mom and informed her that I needed to go job-hunting ASAP or else I was gonna run away and become a professional male escort/stripper. She then spent the next hour reminding me that I had voluntarily chosen to be jobless in El Paso because I felt that I needed a long vacation and wanted to spend some quality time with my family. She also mentioned that, although I'd probably make an excellent male escort/stripper, I had enough intelligence and skills to find a much higher paying and less demeaning job, and in the meantime, I was helping her own business out by taking care of all her paperwork, thus freeing her up to spend more time pursuing clients. Then she gave me $100 to relieve my anguish over being broke. So now, despite my hatred of being back under my parents' general control (no more partying til 3 or 4am on a Saturday night, sigh), I've decided to enjoy my vacation and bask in my family's love and adoration. And so far, it's worked out rather well for me. Life is good.

OK, bedtime; I've got a nice little wet dream to attend to, and Angelina Jolie is the main attraction. Wheeeeeee!"

"event","Saw 2 movies tonight, ""Madagascar"" and ""Unleashed."" Madagascar was utterly boring, in my opinion: nice graphics and whatnot, but absolutely no real humor whatsoever. Even the parts that should've been potentially funny, weren't. As for Unleashed, well, it was definitely better than Madagascar, but not one of Jet Li's best. He whooped a lotta ass of course, but he didn't even talk until halfway through the movie. I still liked it all, I just wish it had more Jet Li acting to go along with Jet Li kicking ass.

OK, I just need to mention that I'm totally psyched about the Pistons winning the Eastern Conference championship. This is because 1) they're an actual team, without any superstars singlehandedly carrying all the weight (ala Dwayne Wade and Shaq), so I really kinda like them; and 2) now they're gonna face my lifelong favorite team, the Spurs. Seriously, I was a Spurs fan before I even knew where San Antonio was on a map. So this series is like Texas vs Michigan II for me, with the last Rose Bowl being TX vs MI 1; the exception is that now, there is no iffy-ness about who I'm rooting for. Spurs all the way, baby!!! If the Spurs win this one, it'll just prove to me that, while I've spent the most important years of my life in two great states, I'm going to be continuing it in the superior of the two.

Actually, I know that as a fact, no matter what the outcome of this series is.

"event","Note to self: Do not try to read a week's worth of missed comic feeds and friends' LJs if it is 1am and you're planning on writing a rather long entry soon yourself. Proof: It is now 2:45am, I just finished reading aforementioned comic feeds/friends' LJs, and am now nodding to sleep as I type this. By the way, that's 2:45am Mountain time, for I am currently home in good ol' El Pisso, Texas, and have been since Wednesday. Thus, this is the first time I've touched a computer all week; my folks have been doing their usual deal of working my ass off continuously every day. Today was Fix Our Clothes Dryer Day, and I'm proud to say that I successfully took it from not-working-and-making-a-buzzing-noise to not-working-at-all-now. Dryer - 1, Engineer - 0. Rematch scheduled for tomorrow.

Ah, let's talk about El Paso for a moment. Wanna talk about ""hot""? I think my 5-month exile in Michigan caused me to forget the definition of ""hot""; I most certainly have been reminded now. But it feels damn good to be back in a place that only drops to 60 at nighttime, despite the 90-100 degree daytime weather. And when it rains (like it did today), the smell is utterly mindblowing cuz all the plants in the area go ""Holy shit, is that actual water???"" and bloom like crazy. And the sunsets are beautiful too, of course. God, I missed desert weather. But then we have the Latinas; I think I hyped them up way too much to my brain, cuz instead of the masses of sexy, gorgeous, barely-clad females I was somewhat expecting, I've been greeted thus far by rather average fully-clad women with no asses. Even the hot ones seem to have no ass. For an ass-lover like me, this is a unbearable fallacy that must be remedied ASAP. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong area; I'm gonna hafta drive around to more places before I leave at the end of next week. I've spent the entire month bragging about you to all them poor deprived Michigander friends, EP; please don't disappoint me <i>yet</i>.

Speaking of Michiganders... dammit, can't stay awake any longer. More tomorrow, maybe, if my duel with the dryer is successful early. Bye now"

"event","So, I was doing some heavy-duty thinking just now, and figured I better write it down before I turn stupid again. I just finished reading <u>Ender's Shadow</u>, which was basically about this little kid that's obsessed about this other kid who is trained to battle aliens while believing that it's all a game. Excellent book, but not nearly as good as it's predecessor, <u>Ender's Game</u>. Anyway, the book got me thinking on a humans-as-a-species level, which in turn got me thinking about how freakin many of us there are on this planet we call Earth. And then I thought about how<lj-cut text = ""I'm not only a tiny fish in a huge fucking ocean, there's also another 20 fish just like me...""> my unique thoughts, actions, feelings, etc, probably aren't all that unique at all. Here in the United States alone, I'm guessing that there are at least 10,000 people who are in the exact same situation as me, with the same dreams and aspirations and goals and the whole nine yards. And then, I'd have to consider all the ones in India, China, Russia, Australia, etc, who are ALSO thinking my thoughts and ideas, but simply doing it in a different language. Except for those Australians, who are just thinking my thoughts in a funny accent. And that's just for me, whom I normally consider a rather unique person. For all of you non-unique folks out there, there has to be like a hundred thousand people almost exactly like you in the US, and then countless others just as similar all over the rest of the globe. I mean, seriously, for every lawyer aspiring to make some huge political impact upon the entire nation, there's at least 2000 right here in the state of Michigan that want to do the exact same thing; for every artist that wants to become the next Picasso, there's gonna be another 200 or so drawing freaky cubsit stuff on a canvas and dreaming about hanging it in the Louvre or some hip New York gallery. Writers, poets, scientists, actors, inventors, preachers, whoever...no matter what you're trying to do in this world, there is <i>at the very least</i> one other person who wants to do the exact same thing.</lj-cut> Almost mind-boggling, I dare say.

OK, enough of that; back to being stupid. Had a rather good weekend<lj-cut text = ""by which I mean that I went to some party and had a damn good time..."">; it was mostly filled with me sitting on my ass doing nothing, but there was a burst of activity on Saturday when everybody decided to remember that I'm still in Ann Arbor and thus proceeded to call me up. I ended up going to a party with Julia and Barrett that night, and goddamn, where have those people been for the last 5 years? There was Bora, who insisted I was the coolest man alive almost as soon as I met him; there was that one girl (Emily? Amy? awww, shit) from Lansing, who had an Ann Arbor curse to match my Lansing curse; there was Ruby, the Hookah King, whom I dubbed ""The Dragon"" for his hookah-smoke-blowing antics (btw, the hookah = yummy... might have to try more in the future); there was Devon, the pimp with the hat who also happened to be the birthday boy; and the list goes on. By far one of the coolest parties I've been to in 2005. I was sad to leave, but it was all good. BTW, my 5-month-long drought is finally over (if you don't know, don't ask), but I'm somehow not as psyched/relieved/ecstatic as I thought I would be. It's more of an ""eh, OK then."" Yeah, I know the real reason(s) I feel that way, but I'm not about to write them in a public entry. Sorries.</lj-cut>

Anyway, the coming week is looking kinda dull once again. It's odd how my weekends are so long and dragging, but the weekends always turn out to be a blast. I want to have fun on the weekdays too, dammit. I especially want to go see ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" this week, but I hate going to the movies by myself. I might have to put out some personal ads or some shit to find someone to go with me.






HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Yeah, that was funny; I'm certainly not THAT desperate yet. Or am I?"

You seduce people by tapping into their dreams and desires.
And because of this sensitivity, you can be the ideal lover for anyone you seek.
You are a shapeshifter - bringing romance, adventure, spirituality to relationships.

Funny how true that is. I started the quiz thinking, ""Oh, this shit is completely lame, I must be on drugs to think it'll actually say anything remotely accurate,"" but lo and behold, it comes up with something that describes me to the teeth. Odd.

Oh, and hi LJ. Long time no write, I know; I wish I could say that it's cuz I've been mad busy for the last 2 weeks, but it'd be an outright lie. Sure, I've been working more than 30 hours per week at Panera, but when I'm not doing that, what exactly have I been doing? Sitting on my ass and being bored out of my mind, apparently. Sure, there's been me hanging out with Feinstein and McCarthy, and that's always mad fun (it seems that my weed paranoia is a thing of the past), and then there's those huge facebook parties, attended by people just as bored/boring as I am, but otherwise...nothing. And now that Feinstein's going to Israel for the next 3 months, there's going to be even more of nothing. It's like starting all over again, freshman year style, having to be bold and actually TALK to other people that I don't have any previous experience with, all without sounding like a complete moron. A virtual impossibility for me. Yet, this is exactly how it's going to be in Austin, worse even, so I guess it's best to practice here where I have a large chance of running into people I'm distantly associated with.

Oooooo, I can't believe I never wrote about me moving into the new house. Yeah, the day after I wrote my last entry, Matt finally showed up, and we were able to get my shit transported to my new place. So far so good here: the housemates are cool, Bill (person I'm sharing a room with) is rarely here, and everything is 1000000 times better than the apartment ever was. I started out being ultra standoff-ish and shit around everyone, cuz god knows I can never get rid of that shy computer geek side of me, but we went and played basketball 2 days ago, and watched Jurassic Park together the next day, so things are coming along smoothly. I just don't want it to end up where I avoid contact with everyone in the house cuz all conversations end in animosity and arguments, the way it was at the apartment. God, I'm glad that shit is over with; how the hell did I deal with that for 8 months? I'd rather shoot myself in both feet than ever go through all that again.

OK, that's enough ranting for now. I need to get off my lazy ass and start doing something productive, like looking for new jobs and shit. Yeah, I'll get to that later; Master of the Nation of Procrasti forever, bitches.

I'm out.</lj-cut>"

"event","Well, I certainly accomplished my goal of being drunk continuously from Thursday to Sunday. I probably consumed more alcohol this weekend than I did for the rest of the month of April combined. Hence, i feel like complete shit today, and not-just-a-little ill. It being fucking freezing cold outside isn't helping either, but I've come to expect no less from Michigan now. I want to crawl into bed and stay there for the rest of the week, except that my bed is supposed be at Judson Court now, instead of STILL at my fucking old apartment. So much for the ""we're gonna have our shit outta here by Friday"" statement by my ex-roommate. So, hopefully, that'll all be dealt with today, and I can start on my new and improved job-hunting for the summer. In fact, I should probably stop wasting time in the Fishbowl and go handle that right now.

"event","So, today was...exhausting. Work was long but enjoyable as usual, except that apparently, today was Performance Review day.<lj-cut text = ""This is where my managers get to tell me what a shitty job I'm doing.""> Yeah, let's just say that the days that I didn't notice on the schedule which I was supposed to be working, came back to bite me in the ass rather hard. Oh well, I didn't need a raise anyway, very few people at Panera realize that I'm one of the highest paid employees there currently. Plus, Jim told me that he'd STILL consider giving me a raise, if I was perfectly punctual for the next 4-6 weeks. How can I not love this company? However, this isn't stopping me from looking for another job for the summer, cuz I know there HAS to be like 50 higher-paying jobs opening up in the area right about now. So, we'll see.</lj-cut>

After work, I left to put my sister's stuff in the mail.<lj-cut text = ""Being the Master of Procrasti isnt' always fun and games.""> Her b-day is tomorrow, and being the Master of Procrasti that I am, I of course waited until today to find a card and mail it and her present to her. At least i had the sense to buy her a bracelet yesterday at Briarwood; it was marked for $60, but fortunately, it was half off. Why didn't I just go for some $10 earrings or something? The dumb brat better like it. Anyway, I went to the post office on Liberty at 5:30, thinking it closed at 6pm, only to find out it closed at 5pm. This confused me, cuz I distinctly remember mailing stuff from there at 6 last year (at the last minute, no less), so I figured that i was thinking of the wrong post office and took off on a mad dash across the entire fucking campus to the S. Univ. post office. Their closing time? Five o'clock. But, underneath their hours, they graciously informed me of an Automatic Package Mailing station, open til 7pm, located at the Liberty St office. The one I had just finished running away from for the last 10-15 minutes. Funny how this information wasn't displayed anywhere at the fucking Liberty office itself. So, back to Liberty, only to find out that my package probably won't get to El Paso until Thursday, despite the overnight express mailing. Sigh. Another day in the life of Darnell.</lj-cut>

In other news, it seems I will finally be able to get the hell outta that crap-ass apartment I'm currently living in. And thank god, cuz the absence of internet was seriously driving me slightly batty. I always suspected that I would never be able to live without internet; now it's a proven fact. Hell, it's BECAUSE of the internet (specifically, LiveJournal) that I was able to find a cheap sublet, and from none other than my alter ego Forster. God, I love technology. However, I'm still trying to think of a way to break the news to my current roommates who, despite receiving an eviction notice last Thursday, seem to be going on with life like everything is all hunky-dory. Not too worried though, cuz how can they honestly expect me to put up with the general crappiness of the situation there? Now, I just need to address the problem of getting all my shit to McFo's place...

Alright, that's all for now. Should be the last update for a while, cuz after Wednesday, I'm hoping to spend the next few days in a drunken stupor. Birthday celebration, what? Graduation 2005, what? Party like it's going outta style? Oh yeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!"

"event","So, it seems my birthday is tomorrow. Yeah, I'm almost as surprised as you are. I didn't even remember it until about 2 days ago, and then it was like ""oh hey, my b-day is coming up...interesting."" Yup, I'll be 23 on the 23rd, which apparently makes it a Golden Birthday or some shit like that. But, oddly enough, i'm just not as excited about it as i've been about all of the other ones. I mean really, once you hit 21, what certain age is there to look forward to anymore? Plus, all of the people that I would actually want to celebrate it with are either hundreds of miles away, or studying for finals. My sister was going to fly up here to visit me so we could celebrate our b-days together (hers is 4 days after mine), but the little brat fucked up in school or something along those lines, and my mom was pissed enough to cancel the whole trip. Good job, genius. Ah well, I guess I'll just round up the usual peeps and go out to dinner or something. After work, that is, because apparently I'm working on my birthday. What can I say, I need the money. :-P

<lj-cut text = ""And now for a tale about a date gone bad"">Speaking of needing money, I had a rather disastrous little date with Priya (my first ex) on Wednesday. We went to dinner at Cottage Inn and then saw ""The Ring 2"" at the Quality 16 (I kinda liked it); to be honest, the date went pretty much how I imagined it would (i.e. ridiculously awkward most of the time, with a few good moments near the end)... except when I got my card declined while trying to pay for dinner at Cottage Inn. Embarrassing? No no, that doesn't even touch the tip of the iceberg; I'm surprised I didn't die from extreme mortification. What made it truly horrible is, <b>I'm</b> the one who suggested we go to dinner, and I even said I would buy for her. ""Oh yeah,"" Darnell thought, ""I've got at least $50 in my account right now, and I haven't had any money problems for the last 4 months, so I'll try to impress the ex by treating her to dinner."" Unbeknownst to the aforementioned idiot, a random payment made <i>2 months ago</i> decided that this would be the perfect week to clear through my bank. Yes, God must truly, truly hate me. So yeah, I don't think I'll be seeing much of Priya after this, and I think it would have turned out that way even if she didn't end up paying for dinner. She was cool as ever, she had somehow gotten even prettier than before, and we had plenty of good laughs and fun moments, but it wasn't hard to see that we just weren't connecting very well, which is one of the main reasons we broke up (*cough*she dumped me*cough*) in the first place. I think we're both kinda past the stage of needing a partner, just to feel loved. At least, I think <b>I</b> am...I never did find out why she decided to try hanging out with me again, after all this time. Perhaps I should ask her sometime. At least I'm still on speaking terms with her, which is more than I can say about my other ex, who would probably like nothing more than to beat me with a baseball bat next time she sees me. Hell, sometimes I think I deserve it. </lj-cut>

Anyway, I guess that's that. Shit happens, but life goes on. 23 years of it for me, in fact. So now, I'm off to waste away my day and perhaps study for my exam on Monday. Or maybe i'll just sleep..."

"event","Man, last night...wow. By far the best toga party I have had in my entire life (which isn't saying much because i've only been to one other one, but still). And yes, i was wearing a toga as well, along with a Jamaican rastafarian cap; I was the party's offical ""Caribbean Ambassador to the Romans,"" haha. I wish I had pictures to show you all, but I failed to bring my camera (as usual). But anyway, drunken debauchery ensued, I got my dance on with several people, and ended up...well, let's just say that my lips are tired and kinda chappy today. No hanky-panky though, I ended up sleeping on their fold-out bed in the living room. Everything was kinda, well, <i>odd</i> with everyone the next morning though; it was like they didn't want to acknowledge my presence. I'm hoping I didn't do something rude or inappropriate to someone and just can't remember now. That's unfortunately happened before.

I've decided that Feinstein is greatly unappreciated by a majority of the populace. People dislike him because they view him as 1) rude, 2) pig-headed and male chauvinistic, and 3) overbearing. I've come to realize that those people are seeing brief glimpses of his distinctly non-PC nature and regarding it in an undeserved bad light. Having spent all of Thursday night just chatting with him on topics such as political correctness, societal pressures, and religion, I can honestly say that his non-PC-ness is utterly refreshing. Like he siad that night, ""People who are too PC are really just trying to blind themselves to the reality of today's society."" Indeed. I would rather have a conversation about, well, pretty much anything, with him more than anyone else (other than my family and my boys Steve and Swarup). Feinstein is now included in the list of people I'm going to miss when I finally get the fuck out of Michigan.

I have more to write, but I'm waaaay tired, and need to catch the bus to get home from the Union. Adios, gente."

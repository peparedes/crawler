"event","so after a 9 hour shopping bonaza yesterday I have a dresser, bookshelf, and pantry shelves.. I did not manage new shorts, BED, or any chairs.  (or a shave)

the weather is improving, i'm corresponding with my recording contact, and thinking of applying for a job with IKEA for awhile until i get on my feet here. 

tomorrow night thinking of going up to NYC to hang out with the old peabody crowd.  I was going to meet them in Baltimore, but that would conflict with clara's move in.  

turns out the coffee shop is french.  who woulda thunk it?

off to search the intarweb for beds, jobs, and a solution to the firewire glitching problem on my computer.  adios"

"event","so i made it to philadelphia!  after 4 hours and 1 night more than planned for, grand total of 20 hours of driving, 1100 miles... damn chicago traffic.  I now live in a two story, two bedroom apt in the grad hospital area of downtown philly.  my poor little civic stopped accelerating at the end of day two, making merging exciting.  (imagine trying to merge at 40 mph with a line of semis going 75 bearing down on you)

new address:
708 s 19th st #2R
philadelphia, PA 19146

I slept in an empty apartment yesterday, excluding only my suitcases, on a thermarest with a flannel sheet.  NOT weather appropriate.  started going to sleep around 9... saw a huge fucking cockroach in the bathroom - no sleep for me. now attempting to get furniture using only a civic hatchback.

neighborhood is a weird mix of yuppie and ghetto.. walking by the extensions hair shop, with bars on the window, cracked and fading paint- I find La Va coffee shop- internet cafe with trendy beautiful people that would not be out of place in queen anne or madrona.  I might become a regular, the coffee isn't bad."

"event","My stupid fucking roommate yelling at his stupid fucking dog!  shut up! jesus the poor shithead is terrified and shaking and keeps trying to run and hide, while Adam hunts him down and yells more.  The MORON (adam) thinks he is training his dog! gaaaaahh!  I want kill him or cry or both.  news flash, if you want a dog to like doing something, don't yell at it.  now the dog is going to be extra special retarded and piss and shit everywhere in the house again.  I can't wait to move out... I found a great place two blocks closer to the grocery(beer) store, with a screened porch and nice rooms.  i just want to sit there right now and watch the thunder and lighting and rain.

I can't wait to go home."

"event","I wake up, eat a hurried breakfast... make tea, no thats before breakfast and so is a shower...  I leave for a 9:30 class or coaching that I actually have to think in.  I always do a poor job at that.  Then I have a stupid medival history class... I only go 'cause if I fail I have to sit through it again.  then I go eat lunch and run back for band.  Band is loud and out of tune, the Maestro makes more mistakes than I do.  then I practice and make reeds, whilst also sometimes eating, taking a nap and perving girls (thats australian for checking out... sounds bad dunnit).

when you get to the end of this drink some beer for me, then start over again."

"event","so I've decided that I'm a monk.  its true!  I live a  regimented life, one might call ascetic, if one was feeling bitter and deprived of all social contact (no, other musicians don't count). I have no TV, nothing to do but meditate on the great god (music) am going to be fasting the day after tomorrow (maybe I get to live on beer!).  I'm celibate and surrounded by temptation (maybe a saint?)  and I'm learning all the liturgical chants.  

I'm paying for this.  all of it. my life savings.  

And my Q@#%$ roommate is getting some in the next room, and I can hear it.  Bastard."

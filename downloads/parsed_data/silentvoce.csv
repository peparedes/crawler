It's from the Album ""Songs about Jane."" Find out more about Maroon 5 <a href=""http://www.maroon5.com/HTML/bio.html"">here</a>. LA-based band.<br>
<br>
Overall, I love this song. It got pretty popular like.. half a year
ago, I want to say. While there are things in diatonic analysis that
make it freaking awesome, there are also things about it that are
beyond analysis that make it awesome. <br>
<br>
<lj-cut text=""here is my analysis!""><br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">For people who are not trained in theory</span>:
Don't worry about all the fancy words I'm using. They're basically just
what you hear defined in English/Italian. I encourage you to just try
to define what you hear first, and then if you want, read through my
analysis to see if we had anything in common.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Lyrics:</span><br>
<br>
verse 1:<br>
<font face=""Verdana"" size=""5""><font size=""2"">
I was so high I did not recognize<br>
The fire burning in her eyes<br>
The chaos that controlled my mind<br>
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane<br>
Never to return again<br>
But always in my heart<br>
<br>
chorus:<br>
This love has taken its toll on me<br>
She said Goodbye too many times before<br>
And her heart is breaking in front of me<br>
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore<br>
<br>
verse 2:<br>
I tried my best to feed her appetite<br>
Keep her coming every night<br>
So hard to keep her satisfied<br>
Kept playing love like it was just a game<br>
Pretending to feel the same<br>
Then turn around and leave again<br>
<br>
chorus:<br>
This love has taken its toll on me<br>
She said Goodbye too many times before<br>
And her heart is breaking in front of me<br>
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore<br>
<br>
bridge/transition:<br>
I'll fix these broken things<br>
Repair your broken wings<br>
And make sure everything's alright<br>
My pressure on your hips<br>
Sinking my fingertips<br>
Into every inch of you<br>
Cause I know that's what you want me to do<br>
<br>
chorus:<br>
This love has taken its toll on me<br>
She said Goodbye too many times before<br>
And her heart is breaking in front of me<br>
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore<br>
<br>repeat<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Analysis</span>:<br>
</font></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the song's overall form seems
to me to be ""AABAABACBB.""&nbsp; Here's a guide to what the sections
mean:<br>
A- verse (c minor)<br>
B- chorus (c minor/Eb Major)<br>
C- bridge/transition (c minor iv-III-viio-i-iv-III-V)<br>
<br>
Pretty standard. You'd think while listening to the song it would sound
that standard with that simple of a structure, but it is not very
simple. <br>
<br>
When you listen to the song, the first thing you are presented with is
the steady bassline. All you can hear is that bassline; it is very
strong. I think that the reason it's so catchy is that it establishes
the basis of the harmonic structure: the fact that they are playing
around with our ears. If you listen carefully, you can't firmly
establish the key (the tonal center, like major/minor or in this case,
c minor/Eb Major). The line goes ""<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">B</span>... B D <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">C</span>... G F# <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">F</span>... F Eb <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">D</span>.... Ab Bb <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">B</span>.""
The tones bolded are the important ones. Those all are in the diatonic
scale for c minor. The way it's written, though... you'll notice that
there is only once instance of the tonic, C. Everything else points
towards C, but never really gets there. It's basically a creative way
to establish the key... by dancing around the fact.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other interesting thing about the bassline is
that it's structured in what seems like a chromatically embellished
phrase, but it can be traced back to jazz roots. The chromatic movement
from F# to F is a slight nuance of a bebop scale in jazz starting on G
(minus the Ab). I wonder if they thought about that when they wrote the
song.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, the chorus is amazing. I don't know how they
came up with it, but basically I think it's hella meaningful not only
because of the lyrics, but the harmonic structure as well. They sing a
simple triad, basically, consisting of three notes: G, Eb, C. The
melody primarily stays on G, and alternates between Eb and C. ""This
Love Has Ta(G) ken(Eb) It's(G) toll(Eb) on(G) me(Eb) and etc etc. The
kicker is this: The harmonic progression changes under it, despite its
oh-so-diverse pool of 3 notes. It changes from the tonic (C) to the
fourth note of the scale (F) which could also be the sixth of Eb, and
subsequently moves to the fifth of Eb(Bb) and then finally to Eb. This
repeats 4 times throughout the entire chorus. It's amazing! And the
melodic line is like... still 3 notes (well excluding the lick at the
end of the phrase which further solidifies the relative Major Eb). <br>
<br>
The bridge is pretty standard, it stays in c minor. moves up to the iv,
then down to III and then again viio-i, twice, except the last instance
of it moves to the dominant of c minor, G. woot. then back to the
chorus, which ends the song.<br>
<br>
</lj-cut><br>
<br>
So overall, here is a summary of it:<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">First section</span>, verses: based on
the bebop scale? Also possibly playing with the idea of 2 keys, c minor
and Eb Major. They relate in diatonic theory. <br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Chorus</span>: Effective movement in
the harmonic line with really amazing movement in the melodic line. 3
notes on top of 2 different key areas. Amazing!<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bridge to ending</span>: standard, but
totally effective (returns to tonic). Doesn't help that the
instrumentalists and singers are freaking awesome, and the lyrics kick
everyone's ass.<br>
<br>
Overall a 9/10!!&nbsp; <br>

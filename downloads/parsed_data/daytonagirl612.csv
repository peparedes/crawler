You're there by my side
In every way
I know that you would not forsake me
I give you my life
Would not think twice
Your love is all I need believe me

I may not say it quite as much as I should
When I say I love you darling that means for good
So open up your heart and let me in
And I will love you 'til forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there
This I swear

I'm wondering how I ever got by
Without you in my life to guide me
Where ever I go the one thing that's true
Is everything I do I do for you

I may not say it quite as much as I should
When I say I love you darling that means for good
So open up your heart and let me in
And I will love you 'til forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there
This I swear

So when ever you get there
Just reach out for me
I'll never let you down my love

And I will love you 'til forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there
This I swear

And I will love you 'til forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there
This I swear 
  


ALMOST 2 YEARS!!  WOW, HOW THE TIME HAS FLOWN BY. AND NOW WE HAVE A SON TO SHARE IT WITH!!  I LOVE YOU MY DARLING JONATHAN!!  ALWAYS AND FOREVER YOURS!!"

"event","Yeah, so this week has been the absolute worst for me. I've been on the world's biggest emotional roller coaster ever. I'm all over the place. It's crazy. But Jon has been the greatest husband ever. He's so understanding. And ultra supportive. He's the greatest. So the nausea finally ended. But now I have to take some antibiotics that make me feel nauseous.  It's absolutely driving me insane. Just six more months to go. Can't wait to find out if it's a boy or girl. I find out next month.  God, I'm so excited. So, we're finally moving into a bigger house, it's awesome. I can't wait to start decorating the nursery. And of course, all Jon talks about is where the crib and the dresser and the changing table is going to go. He's so funny.  I think he's more excited than I am sometimes. The expectant father syndrome. He's so funny!! Well, that's about all for now. I'll post the ultrasound later."

"event","I think back to the times when I raced home to your mom's house after work just to see you.  I hated it when you left me in the morning.  Even though we never slept in the same room, I missed you every night and all day while we were both working.  And now we are back to that time.  I hate it when I have to leave you to go to work.  I wish that I could spend all day with you.  Every day with you is like a dream come true.  You are my knight in shining armor.  You show me love like no one has ever shown me before.  You give me everything you have and it makes me feel like I am important to you.  You make me feel like I am your world.  Every woman needs to feel needed and you do that for me.  While I'm washing dishes you tell me that you love me.  While I'm washing clothes you tell me that I'm beautiful.  While I'm vacuuming you tell me that I am everything to you.  We've had our differences, but we've learned so much about life and each other.  I love you darling more that you could ever know.  I want you and that rest of the world to know that you are my world and that will never change.  Tonight will be extra special for both of us."

"event","Today was a really shitty day.  I got to work late, but I didn't realize I was late until I was pulling into the parking lot.  Then I had to leave from 2-4 b/c I had a meeting in Holly Hill at the district office.  And we were swamped at work, so they all got pissed b/c I had to leave.  Then I get a call from the wonderfull hubby and I had to go home before I went to my meeting b/c he needed a ride to his appointment at 4.  So, I went and got him and drove him to the library in Ormond. Then I went to my meeting which I was late too, of course.  (I'm always late for everything.)  Of course I'm starving by that time, and the stupid meeting was a waste of time anyway.  (Good thing I got paid for it!!)  Then I have to go and pick hubby back up and drive him home.  By the time I got back to work it was 5:00 and I was only supposed to work til 7:00.  But we were swamped and I was stressed out all day.  Then, when I finally get home, I have to go back out and drive all the way to Bunnell to get the mail out of the PO box.  I'm so sick of driving.  Looking forward to a relaxing night w/ the hubby.  Early day tomorrow, though.  Work at 930 AM ... God, I hate my schedule.  Oh, well, life bites."

"event","Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning when you start to raise your head? And does he sing to
you incessantly from the place between your bed and wall? Does he walk around all day at
school with his feet inside your shoes? Looking down every few steps to pretend he walks with
you. Does he know that place below your neck that is your favorite to be touched and does he cry
through broken sentences like I love you far too much? Does he lay awake listening to your
breath? Worried that you smoke too many cigarettes. Is he coughing now on a bathroom floor?

yourself eternally."

Glassjaw- When One Eight Becomes Two Zeros

I'm glad that you're near
And I'm sad when you're here
This is what it's like to be me
I'm glad that you're here
And I'm sad that you're near
This is what it's like to die alone.

This all hurts me so much
That I honestly belive
You're the one this is hard for
Iv'e barterd tact for wit
And Iv'e already made up
A billion stories about you.

Knee deep in static
I hear you breaking up
I'm breaking up
I guess we're breaking up
You're not the other woman
You're just another(woman)
Another hobby for a guy like me.

You've given me a heart like a gun
And I'm so shocked that I made it through
These billion days.
I didn't think I could tough it out for those days
A billion.

Knee deep in static
I hear you breaking up
I'm breaking up
I guess we're breaking up
You're not the other woman
You're just another(woman)
Another hobby for a guy like me.

So we're growing?
I'm sure
There's no other I can turn to
Theres no other I can turn to
If not you, heart
Who else can I belive???

Knee deep in static
I hear you breaking up
I'm breaking up
I guess we're breaking up
You're not the other woman
You're just another(woman)
Another hobby for a guy like me.

I hope you enjoy dying alone"

"event","And the angel of the lord came unto me. Snatching me up from my place of slumber, and took me on high, and higher still until we moved through the spaces betwixt the air itself. And he brought me into a vast farmland of our own midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom arose from the soil. 

One thousand, nay, a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then. And I begged: ""Angel of the lord, what are these tortured screams?"" And the angel said unto me: ""These are the cries of the carrots. The cries of the carrot. You see, reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day, and to them, it is the holocaust."" 

And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat with the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared: ""Hear me now, I have seen the light. They have a consciousness! They have a life! They have a soul. Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses. Save our brothers. Can I get an amen. Can I get a haleluia. Thank you, Jesus."""

"event","i did a free sample tarot card reading online today, you only get to pick 3 cards and this is what i got. i was happy with the results. they were right on the money. http://www.tarot.com/tarot/index.php?

Three of Wands
Position: Love & Me
Main (positional) Meaning:
You and a potential love interest are prepared to take risks to explore new opportunities or enterprises.

The card in the Love & Me position touches on an aspect of how you perceive yourself with regard to possible intimacy in your life.

When the Three of Wands is in this position an adventure is about to be set in motion. This card represents the burning drive that compels a person to risk his or her worldly fortunes for a chance at greatness. Committed to a plan of action, you and a possible partner may be poised to gather resources for a step by step procedure. 

An enterprising spirit inspires you both to strike out in this new direction rather than stay with the status quo. Now you can confidently set out on this journey of exploration and hopefully, enrichment.


Page of Wands
Position: Situation
Main (positional) Meaning:
Change will escalate rapidly. Be quick to participate.

The card that lands in the Situation position refers to social or circumstantial factors which could be affecting your life at this time.

This card is traditionally entitled a Page, but in some modern decks as a Princess. When the Page of Wands is in this position, change is in the air. News may have been released about developments that could put stress on a potential relationship. 

This may be a good time to reaffirm the mutual goal before everyone hits the ground running. Be prepared for a change in hierarchy, a new set of policies, or even a new turn of events to come out of nowhere. Whatever it is, you are in a position to participate in the wave of the future. Change will escalate quickly. 

This is not necessarily a negative development, however, so do not let anyone think this is something to get upset or emotional about. The essential thing? Remember that your purpose is to respond, rather than retreat and wait.


Eight of Coins
Position: Challenges
Main (positional) Meaning:
Give yourself a reprieve from your intense striving. You may gather energy for a potential relationship at a later time.

The card that lands in the Challenges position refers to ways that you can turn obstacles into stepping stones.

The Eight of Coins in this position offers you a chance to render high quality work in a future relationship without becoming consumed by the process. Yes, by all means create beauty, but do remember to take breaks. Your intimacy may be rigorous, not just artistic and aesthetic. You need time off to pursue other activities, a social life and some diversions.

Refresh yourself. Take a break from your single-minded focus so you may return to your desired relationship with renewed energy, excitement, and longing. For optimal health, refrain from an ""all or nothing"" style. Pace yourself. Avoid burning the candle at both ends. This will benefit both you and your future love interest."

Go back to sleep

Lay your head down child
I won't let the boogeyman come

Counting bodies like sheep
To the rhythm of the war drums

Pay no mind to the rabble
Pay no mind to the rabble

Head down, go to sleep
To the rhythm of the war drums

Pay no mind what other voices say
They don't care about you, like I do, like I do
Safe from pain, truth a choice and other poison devils,
Saying they don't give a fuck about you, like I do.

Just stay with me, safe and ignorant,
Go back to sleep
Go back to sleep

Lay your head down child
I won't let the boogeyman come
Count the bodies like sheep
To the rhythm of the war drums

Pay no mind to the rabble
Pay no mind to the rabble

Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums

I'll be the one to protect you from
Your enemies and all your demons

I'll be the one to protect you from
A will to survive and a voice of reason

I'll be the one to protect you from
Your enemies and your choices son
They're one and the same
I must isolate you
Isolate and save you from yourself

Swayin' to the rhythm of the new world order and
Count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums

The boogeyman cometh
The boogeyman cometh

Keep your head down, go to sleep, to the rhythm of the war drums

Stay with me
Safe and ignorant
Just stay with me
Hold you and protect you from the other ones
The evil ones
Don't love you son,
Go back to sleep

"event","I still recall 
The taste of your tears
Echoing your voice 
Just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you 
Still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 
'Till I don't want to sleep anymore

Come on tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away

I just want something
I just want something 
I can never have
You always were the one 
To show me how
Back then 
I couldn't do the things 
That I can do now
This thing 
Is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color 
If I had a heart

I just want something 
I can never have
In this place 
It seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now,
I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look 
You're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder 
Of who I used to be

I just want something 
I just want something 
I can never have
I just want something 
I can never have
Think I know what you meant
That night on my bed
Still picking at this scab

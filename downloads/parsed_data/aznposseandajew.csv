"event","So I finally gave in and joined the Barack Obama train wreck on thefacebook, and here is what I find written on the wall: <br /><br /><em>Chris Poisson (UIllinois) wrote <br />3 minutes ago <br />John McCain and Rudy Giuliani vs. a Woman and a Minority....is there any question who will win the election? Get real all you ""college liberals."" seriously...&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><br />SO so so so depressing, but this is what I've been saying all along! People have asked me, ""Hillary or Obama?"" and I reply, ""America will not elect a woman, and America will not elect a black man. So it doesn't really matter.""&nbsp; My vote would have gone to John Edwards if he wasn't so depressingly behind in the polls - a former cause celebre now lost amongst the waves of buzz about our two new front-runners. A white Southern democrat with the charm and the politics to take it to the top? Holy Mother of Bill Clinton, I think we've got a winner!&nbsp;But at the same time, he's kind of a has-been, and I don't see why he would put his family through the wringer of another campaign. Lord knows we know what THAT's like.<br /><br />Today my dad was explaining about Hillary vs. Obama to his intern from Hong Kong. He said that on the one hand, it's nice to have new ideas from someone who's not the last scion of the Bush or Clinton Dynasties. But on the other hand, the President of the United States is charged with (basically) running the entire world, so it would be nice to have someone with a lot of experience under their belt.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see Barack address our student body on campus last semester, and goodness knows he's an incredible speaker. He has a lot of ideas that I could totally get behind, but I'm afraid that the bigotry and intolerance of all the Chris Poissons of America is too heavy to overcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Like Nancy Pelosi said, we need a New Direction.&nbsp; The mistakes being committed now by our parents will take our entire lifetimes to undo. In my life I try my hardest to fight for the things I believe in, and in this case, &nbsp;I hope to God that 51% of everyone comes along with me. <br />"

I got off the plane in Taipei, and even though I was only in the airport, the smells of asia struck me as if I'd never left.  Humidity -- dampness mingled with air conditioning mingled with cleaning products mingled with people with strange scents.

I missed Asia :).

Updateage, in bullet form:

- Classes seem awesome. Ran around Griffith Park this weekend taking pictures for photojournalism class, and took a tour of the Shrine Auditorium last week for live music production. Yes, these are classes, and yes, I am a senior. Libel law = not so awesome, but it's required. haha.

- I joined our campus tv station, Trojan Vision, and I quit the Daily Trojan because I effing hate them. I'm now producing a talk show Tuesday nights with one of my London roomies. This week our guest is Perez Hilton, celebrity blogger extraordinaire. Should be hysterical.

- I finally quit smoking. For good this time, I hope. I'm optimistic.

- I didn't work out today, which kind of slays me. But I've been doing pretty well. I'm taking weight training this semester, and that on top of working out on my own has treated me pretty well so far. For the first time I'm smaller than it says on my driver's license. Hopefully I'll keep this up. I'm optimistic, maybe even more so about this than the smoking.

- On one hand, life is perfect. On the other, I'm having the typical readjustment issues that everyone gets on their way back from being abroad. It'll take time for me to get used to everyone and everyone to get used to me. But that's just how it goes, I guess. I miss England a lot, but I think everyone from Europe and DC has been doing a fantastic job of keeping up with each other (Jenny lives six seconds away from me, literally). So 2006 will never really die. :o)

- Bowen and Jodie took me to Whole Foods today. I got hummus and soy nut butter. Hanging out with them makes me feel like a normal person again, which I really appreciate. 

- Deb's coming down to see me next weekend. I seriously can't wait; I have not seen that girl in SO LONG. We have plans to see Benji and Adge and Brian, which is going to be an assload of driving, but it's totally worth it. Hopefully I won't get any speeding tickets this time :o) 

I guess I should get back to reading. And no, Weefy, still no gossip. Sorry. :o) MISS YOU GUYS SO SO SO MUCH.

Catalan spoken everywhere.

One of the most impressive churches -- you sit down outside of it, and all you can see is sky... and the tip of the ferris wheel of an amusement park right next door.

Amazing beaches... covered in people.

Good food, better friends.

<lj-cut text=""Que Raro!"">Barcelona seems to be the land of dichotomies... as if it could be this amazing city but somehow... doesn't make it.  Don't get me wrong... I've thoroughly enjoyed my time here, met some AMAZING people, learned a ridiculous amount, and eaten even more.  But there's something... slightly off about Barcelona.

On another note, I'VE FINISHED MY COURSE!  Holy shit.  The last two weeks were intense.  Intense to the point of... going to school at 9 and finishing at 1am about every night.  Intense to the point of tears.  Intense bonding.  Intense teaching.  Intense learning.  Intense.

I passed with a B, which is EXCELLENT.  Most people get a 'pass' which basically encompasses 70 percent of people.  30% get a B, something like 5% get an A.  There was some controversy about the... objectiveness of the grading, but I'm not going to complain.  The work has paid off!

I'm currently staying with a friend from the course in Vilanova, and looking into jobs in the Catalunya area (currently looking into one in Terragona, a little south of Barcelona, and one at the North American Institute in Barcelona) as well as seeing what I can find in terms of, y'know, a place to live :).  Vilanova is lovely.  There's a wonderful festival on, with giants and human castles, and lots of music.  It has a much more small town feel (much like Davis, actually), and it's lovely being able to stay with my friend for longer.  As usual, I've done something that's created intense bonding... only to have everyone go their separate ways.  Story of my life, it seems.

Here's some pics o' me teaching... this was the younger groups, aged 8-10.  I hope you appreciate me putting them up here, horrendous pictures of me as they are ;).  Did I mention how much I love kids?

"event","Well kids, after a trip that seemed like it lasted about 40 days, I find myself in France.  The trip was so tiring.  It was basically straight travelling for 36 hours on 3 hours of sleep and random hours snatched in airports (and those aren't good, 'cause you're all on edge, thinking someone's gonna jack your bags).  So... it was intense.  I landed in the afternoon, in Basel (on the French Swiss border) and went with my dad and my grandma in to Zurich for dinner.  And we got to drive around and chill, but we didn't get back to the hotel until like... 10:30, and I just passed out until this morning.

Today has been chill, and I expect most of my stay in France to be about the same... we're hanging in Colmar, which is apparently the most beautiful city in Alsace (the area we're in at the moment) -- apparently so beautiful that the Allies wouldn't bomb it in WWII ( this part was under German occupation, of course).  Anyway, it's LOVELY.  It's got a canal (they call it petit venice, for obvious reasons), and some beautiful cathedrals.  My dad and I saw a BEAUTIFUL one, very daunting architecture... like y'do ;).  Then we sat at a cafe, shared a liter of beer, and watched the people go by.  It was excellent.  It stays light until like... 10, or 10:15 pm here, and it kind of throws off your sense of time, but we're doing the whole European thing of eating at 8pm or later.

France is playing Spain, and all the bars are PACKED with people watching the game, and as we were walking back to our hotel from dinner, we heard random cheering from the windows.  In fact, I'm watching the game right now, so I'm going to abandon you folks, but I'm starting to get a real appreciation for the fact that I know NO french, but I can get by a whole helluva lot better in Spainsh.  Nothing like a humbling floreign language experience to make you appreciate what you do have, right? ;)

Anywhat, I'm not going to ramble at you guys too much.. just wanted to drop a note to let you all knwo that I'm alive :).

Heading off to France at the ass crack of dawn tomorrow morning, and won't actually land there until the evening on Monday.  So... that'll be fun ;).  Hang out with the faja and his mother for about a week, and on Saturday the 1st, I'll fly in to Barcelona, meet my new flat-mate, Carmen, and get ready for some intense English-teaching-learning!  If that makes sense ;).

On a totally different note: Saw Shelby-kun at the farmer's market last wednesday.  He was serving pizza, and I was buying it.  It was almost more awkward than Alison.  Me: Standing in line, pretending I don't see him.  Him: serving pizza, pretending he doesn't see me.  Me: gets to the front of the line, he gives me my pizza, i have to make eye contact.  Him: Same.  Me: Shelby?  Him: Heather?  Me: Been a long time. *makes a run for it with the pizza in hand*.  SO awkward.

And then, as I'm coming out of University mall, what do I hear?  ""HEATHER?"" Blink. blinkblink.  I look up and it's Diane.  Diane Ghrist.  So we... chat amiably for a couplea minutes, and I run 'cause I'm getting ready to MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.  But... it wasn't awkward at all.  It was chitchatty, but that's always the way it goes, isn't it?  Very odd.

Last night, hung with Adriel, Adriel's John, Ben, Anna, Jessimica, Deb, and Latanya (sp?).  Smoked, drank.  It was good, chill times.  I enjoyed myself.

Today, I went into the city and met my friend Cris (it's his Birthday!) and we hung out and wandered around and it was /so/ chill and pleasant, as if I weren't about to leave the fucking country.  I love that guy. Some day, you guys will have to meet him.  Oh.  And I dropped into his birthday party for a while, and the first friend he introduces me to?  Goes: Oh!  This is the pirate friend? *facepalm*.  I guess it works both ways, eh?

Anyway, off I go.  Wish me luck.  Email me luck.  LJ me luck.  Love you guys!!!!  HO!  SEE YOU SOON!

i couldnt handle anymore of his arguments with me about how i shouldnt care so much about my grades and my resume. i didn't have the energy to decipher his sarcasm and snideness when he wouldnt tell me what was wrong. i couldnt stand the fact that his actions spoke louder than words, and at the end of the day, i didn't believe he was willing to give as much of himself as i was. 

i was tired of telling him when things upset me, and him respnding with, 'well this is in part because of your own personal issues/insecurities coming out and making our situation harder. if you found inner peace/balance you wouldnt be so stressed out and sensitive.' 

if only you could throw drinks at people across the internet. ;)




mo- don't worry. things will be best in the end. i know it will. someone like you deserves it more than most people i know.
jew- really happy that i got to see you. :) *beamk*
mei- rock on in england for me, keep me updated on the hash and hos."

There's nothing better than

Sleeping through parts of lecture, and then calling out your professor in discussion on his attempts to convince us that the concept of Communism was of his own creation.

Being told by a woman in the International Office that you are one of their favorite students, because even when things aren't at their best you're still always smiling and calm.

Walking home and stopping by your favorite bakery to get a chicken salad sandwich on bread baked that morning. Today it was a rosemary french roll.

mmm. All nighter last night, so naptime before next class.

"event","That's right kids, hi from Santa Barbara!  From Adriel's house in Thousand Oaks, she gave me a ride to Port Hueneme (pronounced wynemi) just on the coast from where she lives.  I stayed there with Shannon and Nic (from the Chieftain) and it was good times.  Seriously, the chieftain people are like a drug.  You can't just go cold turkey after living with them 24/7 for 4 months.  It was a good...weaning experience ;).  AND...I got to go see the Lady.  And spend a bit more time with the people I really miss.  And I met The Man With The Most Beautiful Eyes In The World.  It was an experience, to say the least.  I think I'm going to have to feed my habit once more when the Lady's in the bay area before I head off to Spain.  I'm such a junkie.

So I took the train up here to Goleta and Preston picked me up (bloody train was like half an hour late...).  Basically I've just been chillin' with him and Diana between classes and work.  I met Preston's neighbor, who seems cool enough.  We went on a little stroll through a wildlife marshlands preserve thing and saw lots of neat birds.  and a turtle!  Woot.  It was a bigger version of Finch :).   And we went to the beach and it was rediculously windy.  They cooked me burritos.  It was nice.

I'm heading out tomorrow, spending lunch with Martin in SLO (He's really busy, he has a midterm on Thursday, so I'm just going to stop in) and then I'm up to Berkeley!  My grand tour of Southern California is coming to an end -- and as usual, it's bittersweet.  I'm still going to miss all the people that I'm leaving behind, but I'm really glad I got to see everyone -- and for a decent amount of time as well.  I'm SO excited to be able to see you hot berkeley asians, and I'm one step closer to home.  My parents are all up on my nuts to get me home.  Go figure, right?

Home again, home again, jiggedy jog!

"event","So...a few of Ben's brothers thought it would be a really good idea to, after a day of work party at the house, go to Tijuana for the night.  I thought that was a spectacularly bad idea -- especially considering I've just COME from bloody Mexico.  So as we wound down at the end of the day and people were getting ready to go, I was just kinda chillin', reading my book, doing the chilled out thing.  Out of nowhere, Aaron runs into Ben's room and procedes to convince me through the cunning use of gratuitous amounts of flattery.  And then of course, everyone was staring at me, so I had to say yes.  So we all pile in the car (actually 2 cars as there were nine of us) and headed south to the border.  We went with a guy who's cousin always go to TJ, so we ended up in this sort of collection of clubs that was mostly mexicans, not so much white people.  Which was pretty much awesome.  White people can be no so good.  Plus, we had the most amazing tacos and quesadillas.  Mmm.

So anyway, we danced and drank and danced some more.  I got 3 lap dances in the space of like 5 minutes, which was interesting, and the little pledge got his mack on.  About 3:30 we decided we wanted to get going, but there was big drama 'cause more than 5 people wanted to go back...only 3 wanted to stay.  So we ended up going back with a different car load of people, and so when we went through immigration, the new dude (a permanent resident, not citizen) not only told them the truth that he was born in Taiwan, but didn't have his fucking passport!  So we waited for close to an hour for him to come out and, after 45 minutes and a 263 dollar fine, we finally got going.  So late were we, that we got back only 10 or 15 minutes before the guys that stayed behind.  I ended up going to bed at 8am after washing the cigarette smoke out of my hair (but not out my clothes, mingingly enough).  What the HELL was I thinking?  Still, good times at BenJAMIN's.  And now I guess I can say I've been to Tijuana.  Whoo?  There's pictures on Facebook.  Ask Ben about them.  I'm not cool enough to be on facebook.

"event","So I'm staying with the Fialas, which is awesome 'cause I haven't seen the in a long time.  At the same time, it's really weird.  See, in my house as in so many these days, all the kids have moved out, or are at least off at school.  Here, not so.  Both kids are still in high school, and at that sort of time in life where hanging with your parents isn't cool, being out of the house all the time is the order of the day.  A time of curfews and chore lists, and bedtimes, schoolwork and sports, extra-cirricular activites.  A regimine of school, TV-shows, dinner, dishes.

And here I am, it's like sitting in the eye of a hurricane.  Life goes on at its usual pace, and I get up when I want, I eat when I want, I don't have a job or school.  I can take a 3 hour long walk if I want, or I can sleep 'til noon, or I can sit on my ass all day, or I can do chores if I want.  My world now and my life from before clash, but in a way I kind of like.  It's an amazing contrast that I'm not sure I'll ever have the chance to see again.  I loved my last years of high school, but I'm also extremely excited to be where I am today.

As always, I miss you all terribly.

On a completely different note, I have been reading 'People's History of the United States' by Howard Zinn.  It's depressing to say the least, but it's also incredibly enlightening.  I would just like to say, the tragedy is not that people go hungry during a famine.  The tragedy is that people go hungry when there is food to be had, simply because it is not PROFITABLE to bring the food to market.  Capitalism can bite my ass.

We've got a fuckoff huge cruise ship as a neighbor in the anchorage, and the dubious company of countless jetskis and parasailors making the rounds.  Other than that, the scenery is dramatic and lovely.  Huge cliffs rising out of the sea, endless sandy beaches...it's lovely.  What's also lovely is that we're done pounding into a headsea.  We've been bounced around for the last four or five days and we're happy to be out of it finally.

In other news, I was actually able to use a proper BLANKET last night.  It was a real step forward.  I feel like I've grown a little.  Hooray for blankets!

The end is in sight!  Finally ;).  It looks like we're going to be here in Cabo for a week or so painting the boat (which is about the most unglamorous thing you can think of.  It involves a lot of sanding, respirators, hanging over the side in bosun's chairs for so long you can't feel your legs, and paint so toxic you have to coat yourself in latex to be able to use it -- needless to say, I'm not allowed near the stuff).  After that, it's only the transit from Cabo San Lucas (which is at the southern tip of Baja California) up to LA, and I'm finished!  I will have made the WHOLE BLOODY JOURNEY!  And I'll be able to see you bitches.  I miss you guys tons!  If any excitement happens in Cabo, I'll let you know.  I'm not optimistic.

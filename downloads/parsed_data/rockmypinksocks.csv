I saw that guy that we met last night at the cafe there, his name was like don or something, but man o man he was plastered! LOL, I saw Derrick my little surfer boy <3! and I saw a guy named Mikey, I've known him for about 4 or 5 years and havent seen him in about 3... he still lives in Fort Walton and goes to CHS! He worked there, and I got his SN... I remember when I had the hugest crush on him... he grew his hair out and it flips like crazy... He's still pretty cute... but on a different note, were leaving in the late morning, early afternoon, so yeah! I'm drink a pina coloda and it's YUMMY!

After that I called Mike and he came and got me, and we rode around town and then went to his friend Joe's house to see if he was home, and he wasnt..hah! After that we went by his house and then we went on a Nature Trail and he got some sticker things stuck in his leg =(! After that, we went to the park in downtown off of Cervantes and then we just drove around and had a blast!! AND then it started raining... so we had to pull over, after a while it lightened up and he drove me home...we were sitting in my drive way, and he asked me OUT! I WAS LIKE, YES! I was so stoked... he's such a sweet person... AHH I love him to death! David was kind of mad when I told him, but OH WELL! ANYWAYS, I'm going to clean my room!

<h2>You Are Slowly Undressing Someone</h2>
Your foreplay is slow, seductive, and totally transparent.<br>
When you want some, you take action!<br>
And you turn your lover completely on in the process.
<br><br>
You've been known to undress with your teeth -<br>
And kiss all over. If it involves talent and time...<br>
Well, let's just say you have plenty of both.

<h2>You Are A <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/kissquiz.html"">Manic Kisser</a>!</h2>
<b>About Your Kissing Style:</b><br><br>	 
You've kissed your brother's friends and your friends' brothers...<br>
In fact, you've kissed almost everyone in your circle (plus a few strangers).<br>
You're a total kissing fool - just make sure you don't look like one!<br><br>
<b>What Your Kissing Style Says About You:</b><br><br>
You're a total experimenter who likes to try all of life's flavors<br>
You can't be tied down to one style, one type of kissing, or even one person.<br>
There's so much to feel, see, and touch... why limit yourself?<br><br>
<b>Your Personal Kissing Matches and Mismatches:</b>
<br><br>
Another Manic Kisser is perfect for you. You'll both enjoy kissing each other while 
getting your freedom. No jealousy. No drama. Freaky Kissers are total
variety seekers too. One Freaky Kisser will kiss you 100 different ways... nice!
<br><br>
No doubt that you've got to stay away from Romantic Kissers!
These sensitive types will just not understand your need to spread it around - and will end up hurt and
broken hearted. Same goes for Intense Kissers who will want all
your attention focused on them, all the time. As if!

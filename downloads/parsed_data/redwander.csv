"event","Been in this ""Teacher"" job for the past 6 months liao.  It's both fun and relaxing ... the perfect job for a slacker.  But then rite, how much slacking will it take for one to climb that ladder up high in the society ? Zero lor .. sad to say, success comes with a price tag and it aint ez at all.  So I've been sending resume for hopping opportunities already.  Heard from 2 companies so far, will be glad to have a few interviews before making the right decision actually.   Currently, got this company interested in hiring me.... I went thru 2 interviews, saw 1 bitch, 1 nice lady, the Managing Director and 1 ah pu neh. Doesnt look easy to get into the company considering the number of rounds and the tests I had to go thru.  Then rite, they still wan to negotiate on the compensation lor .. i think is ridiculous .. Do everything and then in the end only they can win, you are only the employee, so too bad for u, u lose.

My dilemma now is whether to hop or stay on the current job la.

"event","If I ever get stranded on an island alone,
I'll jump on any ship that comes along ...
Be it a pirate ship or a ghost ship,
it makes no difference to me.

All I need is a sense of belonging,
belonging to someone is the only thing that I need and care about,
someone good or someone bad,
it doesnt matter to me...

Sometimes, even if it seems to everyone that I belong to somebody,
little does anyone know that,
deep down inside, 
I am still stranded in the same island,
feeling lonely and empty,

Maybe life is meant to be,
so empty and meaningless."

WooHoo !!!

2 more lessons to go before the Traffic Police Assessment

Lesson 7.01 will be at night though ...sian

Cuz I can't U-turn properly yet 

Had my lunch at Tiong Bahru Kopitiam this afternoon, 

I think the mixed veg. rice sux, taste like stale lor 

And whilst walking to the bustop, saw some CheeNa Tong Zhi performing on stage

Quite funny cuz they can arch their body and do amazing moves effortlessly

Following that performance was a magic show performed by another CheeNa Tong Zhi

The host introduced her as 'The Amazing Card Magician' or something in Mandarin

And she must've hidden 10 decks of cards in her body or breast or armpit or wherever

Cuz at one point, she was throwing the cards in the air non-stop ... quite fascinating

For me, the hightlight of the act is definitely the host ...

He looks like the typical Uncle-Uncle with curly-wurly hair ...

And actually resembles those hosts at  'Hungry Ghost Festival' stage performance ... quite funny

Last bit, as mentioned in last nite's entry, tis the 2nd animation I did together with <lj user=""muii"">and Alan... enjoy

Mood is so-so too ... 

Getting ready for tomorrow's lesson 6.01 ' licensed to be on the road '

Walked home from office with Monster just now,

Took like an hour or so.

Didn't feel all that tired but armpit does smell a little sourish when I got home ... *yucks*

Hmm... was thinking of doing some animations on my free time to play online ...

Everyday seems the same to me ...

*Sigh* .... 

Maybe I should get a new hobby apart from the current one I have i.e irritating people

Mervyn knows well enough how good an irritant I can be if I want to ... haha

When will I ever get that big break ...

The chance that will propel me to a higher level in creativity ... 

*Sigh*... dunno ... 

Dunno dunno dunno dunno dunno dunno dunno dunno ...

XXX's driving me crazy ...

The more I think about it, the more I feel it's pointless to dwell on her craziness ...

Failed my subject 6.01 lesson today ...

First time riding bike on the road ain't easy at all ... 

But it beats gettin' screamed over the phone by XXX and then insisting that I should rush home immediately with the car so that XXX can go to the vicinity and buy 4D.  

4D, ya 4D rulez Big time !!! 4D can make the closest people around you turn against you ...

Ask me, I've experienced that first hand ...

Now the purpose of living seemed to have changed.&nbsp; It's always about ' who - makes - the - most - money ' before you die , and I always wonder what can that contribute to the ""values"" that teachers used to preach during school days. 

Realised that I've been talking to myself quite often these days. I don't think it is a good sign, think I'm becoming schizo soon.&nbsp; 

I want to move out, I don't want to stay here anymore.&nbsp; I'm want to move out with my hamster, PS II and all the games, my 3 computers, and all my new clothes. 

No job, no money.&nbsp; Now, it is not even possible to go around taking photographs with my lomo-camera.&nbsp; 

I pray to God sometimes, I wonder if he actually hears my prayer and answers them.

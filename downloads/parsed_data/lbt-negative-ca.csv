Negative Calorie Food is much more likely to burn fat compared with other foods. The reason we call the calories of these foods negative is simple: By eating this food you do not only burn your excess fat or calories, but you burn more calories than the calories that are contained in the food! A negative calorie diet is probably the most effective way to increase metabolism and burn calories."

"event","Okay, Jim. I know you're gonna read this, which is why I didn't put a note on the friggin' fridge. Because you don't see that shit, and obviously you use my computer! And you have a livejournal like every other EMO KID out there - not including me, because I'm not emo, ahah - and I know you're gonna read mine. You want to know all my dirty little secrets.

Therefore. 

You're not using my computer anymore. Use your stupid Sidekick or whatever that shit is, and... ah, fuck it. It's not like there's anything on here that you don't know already. But you are one strange motherfucker, just so you know. Tshirts and emo kids and cats in the fridge. Thanks for being my friend, asshole.

Notice my laptop isn't at home?

All your base are belong to us. I'm bringing beer home, order pizza. Also, is that girl going to be there?"

The scary thing is, I'm not sure. I don't know how I feel, but I <i>do</i>, except if I say it out loud, or even say it here where no one can read it, then it'll blow up in my face. Can it happen after just a couple of times of seeing each other? I'm really fucking scared of how I feel, because... I might be in love. 

There, I said it.

And now I feel like I'm going to barf on my computer. Even though I know no one can read this except me... It's in print, it's out loud. And someone might find it."

"event","After practise, the guys and I, as usual, decided to crash out here. I think after the party at Cherry and Leo's house, I think they're gonna be perfectly happy not to see us for a while. 

Okay, so now it's ten minutes after I started this, and I've spent the majority of that just kind of staring at the screen, because maybe I shouldn't be typing in a journal on someone else's computer while I'm hungover. I almost told them last night. That I met someone. But I don't think mentioning him when I'm drunk is exactly a good idea. I think he deserves a little more respect than that. In fact, I know he does. 

I don't know how I feel, and it's kind of fucked up, because nobody's ever taken their time with me - guys aside, but that's not relationshipy or anything - but he made dinner and we talked, and then... something else happened. And he took his time with that, too. Made it about me and not him.

It makes me think about Gena, and what a total juxtaposition (yes, I know big words) it is to be with him instead of her. I was in love with her, and she treated me pretty shitty. I remember one time she slapped me because she thought I was looking at someone else. I don't even remember if I was, or not. And how she tried to make me change who I was, and how I look. She said she did it because she loved me, and wanted me to feel better about myself. It kind of made me feel worse. That I wasn't what she wanted, and that she wanted me to be... I don't know, not me. Gena was the one that started calling me Snacky. Which I fucking <i>hate</i>. It's one of those names that never really goes away

He likes me for who I am.

I wanna see him again. I can't just <i>not</i> see him, you know? I just don't know where to go with this whole thing, or what he wants from me. That sounds really terrible, doesn't it? But... what he's told me about himself... I'd really like just to make him happy. 

Okay, so I just confirmed my gayness. Whatever."

Where: Nick's place
When: July 6th
<div align=justify>
***

Is six too early? Too late? It seems like a safe enough time, once he's settled on it, and Nick's place isn't so hard to find, once he sits behind the wheel of his car and just... breathes. It's funny, how quickly the neighbourhoods change between his apartment and Nick's home, and Zach has a curious pang of nostalgia for just living in a house. Okay, yeah, his younger brother just about drove him bat country, and his older sister used to dick around with his guitars all the time, and Jimmy's not that bad a guy, but.

There it is, right there: a nice, neat little house with a truck parked in the drive. Nick's truck. Nick's house. Even though he said he wouldn't, Zach's brought a couple of CD's that he burned, one of them with one of his own songs on it. But he's not telling Nick that, no way. Still not brave enough, there.

Dressed as neat as he can manage in an old Minnesota Twins shirt under a black hoodie, paired with a faded pair of jeans and absurd black-and-white checked <a href=""http://howcool.com/catalog/popup-images/TUK-A6253.jpg"" target=""_blank"">shoes</a>, it's the best he can do, considering his floor's laundry night is tomorrow.

Zach pulls in behind Nick's truck in the driveway, gets out, and stands at the front door with his fist raised for a good five seconds before realizing he's standing there like a total ding-dong, and finally knocks."

"event","If anyone reads this, I'll be surprised.

If I were right-handed, I'd be like everyone else. Me and Jude are Team Left.
If I knew how to talk to people, maybe I wouldn't be so nervous.
If people say they like me, why do I have such trouble making other friends?
If I find a way to say how I feel, then maybe I'll be a stronger person.
If I was a strong person in the first place, then I'd have respect.

I need an outlet."

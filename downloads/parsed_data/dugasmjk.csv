Let's think about it The guys they have there now are not good enough to be the everyday starter so why don't they find away to get Nomar back, i know they have to wait till may but i think Nomar would wait is he new they were still interested by saying some thing discreat about needing a shortstop. Well i hope Nomar holds out and that Hendry understands that he is the best fit for shortstop. Oh yeah the deal to offer him is a 1 year deal with a pay cut that has incentives for how many games he plays and a option for the next year,god that would be brilliant i wish i was the GM, beacuse the cubs would be sitting pretty."

This is what i live for, watching baseball live, well at least when it is my Cubs, also I just realzied that the Chronicles of Amber is probably the best book sereis ever wirtten. If you get the chnace to check out The author Roger Zelazny is by far one of the best writers ever. Well I think i'm taking off gonna catch some sleep, but before i forget anyone who loves Nada Surf as much as I do, just though you might want to know that they're going to be playing at the Metro in Chicago in October on the 14th, well peace and good night everyone even though I probably don't care much.

While I was sitting here I wrote something that I was thinking about using in a song that I plan on singing about her. here are some of the words the one's that mean the most that just came off the top of my head:

""Nothing ever seems to be enough for you
I dropped to my knees and did everything you asked me to
the thought of you not here
allows my eyes to shed a tear. 
Or was it not enough for me, I miss you.""

That is dedicated the possibly the greatest person I may have ever know and probably will know.

The main one on my mind is that fact that I finally realize what life is about and what it is about with out my Mom, it's just that I miss not being able to talk to her. You know when you have things on your mind and you need someone to talk to that knows you and knows what to say and no matter what they say your gonna be happy when your done, even if your not happy. Well like the other thing in my head I just wish she was here to talk to about it I would really love to hear what she would have to say. I know I am not over her being gone. I don't really want to make this a sad entry, but this is all I can think about. When I actually do leave my house to go live somewhere else it's gonna be so weird knowing that all my memories are going to be gone with this house, well not gone but not so easy to remember. Well I guess I can stop for now. I guess that I will have sometime to think about but when I am sleeping tonight. I say dreams tell you everything, anything you dream about is gota be a good thing since that is your subconcious talking. Well I am out peace."

I have  a few pals that are getting together and we might try to secure a house which would be a real cool thing. I mean they're my pal's, but they can be shaky at times. Right now only two of the four have jobs, but I am for sure as hell going to start looking. Well yeah I know how I keep saying I want to go to Chicago, but ya'know I think staying around here a lil longer would be a good thing, I don't think I am quite ready to let all my friends go ya'know. Well I realize this could all just be me ranting but oh well.......oh well. Peace every one."

"event","Hey everybody it is begining to seem to me that I am loosing much interest in just about all things now. To tell you the truth it kind of sucks. I had this girl want me and instead of actually trying I just found anyway possible to make her unattractive, oh and it worked but I never really thought she was any way but I even lost the urge of just dooing her to piss all the guys off that want her. It seems that everyone went to the movies tonight, to see Return Of The King again. Awesome movie would have went if they weren't all going as couples. Oh yeah and if half of the girls going weren't ones that I once tried hooking up with. I mean it doesn't bother me that my boys are hooking up with them, but what does bother me is I now know that my ego that I once had has diminished. Altogether I have realized that basically all girls are evil, I apoligze in a way to all the people I offend but it is true. Well I was basically bored and I want too get drunk tonight but, it seems that, I do not believe it will happen. I love you greg your a funny fella you should get your ARSE back here before I go to Chicago. Well i'm gonna watch the rest of the wings intill the steelers come on then i'm gonna wantch them. Peace everyone, oh and a happy New Years!"

"event","Well I got back about 11:30 from what was one of the single best nights of my life. I saw A Perfect Circle in concert. I mean I got to see my hero Maynard James Keenan live. He is the best singer in the world. That guy absolutely kills me, funny as all hell. It was so awesome that I must have spated in my pants at least 4 to 5 times. Really the concert blew me away I never expected it to be that good. They didn't play the song I wanted to hear the most though but it is okay. I just was hoping that I would here a A Stranger tonight, or well pretty much last night since it is a new day now. I never thought that I could say That I want to live more then how much I want to live right now. Well I know this feeling will go away eventually but at least I have maybe two to threes days to still remember this concert night. Peace"

Saw someone I hadn't talked to in a while since one of my tragic days, and I was happy to see her, it had been a long time since I talked to her.

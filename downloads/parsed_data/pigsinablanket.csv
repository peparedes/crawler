"event","well. once upon a time there was a midget. his name was ryan and he was so frickin annoying that i wanted to chop his head off. but i didn't because then i's go to juvi until i was old enouf for jail then live there but thats just a hassle. dr phil 2day's about blubbery, obese people. its nasty. they look like huge blubber balls. im in a negative mood today. maybe ill rite a story. well, one day there was this piece of hair. the piece of hair was red. bright red. no one liked this piece of hair. he was red. and nasty. he was an obese hair. the once was attached to a little boy named jimmy but jimmy hated his hair (so did everone else) so he shaved it off. so this ugly, red hair was chopped off and sent down the drain. i dont know why he put his hair in the sink, i don't really want to know. the little red hair was never the same, he had seperation anxiety and clousterphobia so he was seperated from jimmy and in a small area for a very very very long time.  one day the red hair found someone that i forget their name and they lived happily ever after in the happy little red hair land."

BIG SURPRISE. :) Nada on any big  plans... Except maybe something with Ashley, we're looking into that one... Hum, well, I have a bad headache again and I have gym tomorrow. Gym sucks. It's stupid! Gym was fine at Franklin but WHAT'S THE POINT? I have NOBODY in my class (Well, there's Diya and Mayra) and everyone in Hickey's class but no one likes Hickey anyways so WHY THE HELL IS THERE GYM?! I am SO tired and I need to do my homework and I'll be up late again tonight. Whoa... Cool beans... The Game is the reason to stay up late and get less homework (even though I couldn't care less about people chasing balls with sticks) and you can blame it on the game when you fall asleep on the desk. I did watch like 10 minutes of the game last night just so I could have a reason to yell because I was spastic. So the only reason I even saw the game was because I heard my stupid brother yelling at the TV and I thought in my little brain 'Gee Whiz, an excuse to yell!' so that's why I was screaming at the television during the 12th inning at 10pm. :) It was fun while it lasted. I better go do my homework so I can stay up late doing nothing except yelling at the TV and pretending to know why I'm yelling. Toodles my darlings..."

"event","Howdy! I am SO bored that I made this online journal thingy that I will probly write in for about 2 days then totally blow it off and then it will be DEAD! That way next time I get bored I can just make a new one and start all over again! yay! Well, I guess you would all like to know about Eugene, the flower that lived in a flower pot but one morining Eugene woke and and he was in a boot instead of his beloved flower pot. Well, Eugene wasn't any old flower, he was a Juskaliverwatchi. Juskaliverwatchi flowers are really just any other stupid flower so that doesn't matter anyways. So, his name was Eugene. He lived in a flower pot. One day he rolled himself into town to find that he wasn't in town, he was in china. He has roleld himself into a hole. The hole was hand dug by little billy whoppersville. Little Billy Whoppersville was a very determined 1 year old and his parents one day told him to go dig a hole to china, so he did and they didn't belive him so they told him to come inside and watch some good old fashioned TV. SO, Little Billy Whoppersville did not get the chance to fill in his Hole To China and poor little Eugene just happened to be in the little flower pot that rolled into Little Billy Whoppersville's Hole To China. Well, when in China you must learn how to communicate so Eugene learned from other local  flowers who were very helpful. Then he met a caterpillar sitting on a mushroom and learned the vowels (in chinese of course). Then Eugene got hungry, as all flowers do, and took a bite out of the mushroom. Poor Eugene ate the wrong side and shrunk. But that was okay because Eugene was overweight anyways. So, after shrinking to average Juskaliverwatchi size, Eugene found his lighter self easier to roll around and rolled down a big chiense hill called mount everest. Eugene was then named the first flower to ever roll Mount everest but Eugene's mission was far from over. Eugene rolled to the part of down called BeJing. He the rolled out of that place because he almost got ran over by one of them damn bike riding chinese hooligans. He rolled into a quieter part of china and by then it was very late and Eugene the Juskaliverwatchi flower decided to stay under a nice picnic table for that night. During the night a starving atrist named Kwok Fu Yu decided to look under his picnic table and found Eugene. He knew he should not wake up Eugene or he might revolt and roll away. So, knowing this Kwok Fu Yu quietly found a big bright pink plastic boot and transplanted Eugene into that. When Eugene woke up he decided to go rolling but couldn't flip over and when he did, it wouldn't move. Then Eugene look down and said ""Shit, I've been transplanted into a big bright pink plastic boot overnight by a starving artist named Kwok Fu Yu who came out in the middle of the night and knew not to wake me or I might revolt and roll away!"" THE END"

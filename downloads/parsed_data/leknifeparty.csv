"event","so i decided to split the weekend.
sucks that im not finishing my arm, but hey, its just an arm. once i get it finished it will ALWAYS be there, and i like that.
the consistency of the tattoo comforts me.
no matter what is going on my life, i wake up, look down, and bam there they are. theyre gonna stick with me no matter what. no matter how shitty i act. no matter how bad i hurt. no matter how much in debt i am. or if i go to jail for the rest of my life.(for killing somebody duh)

on the other hand, happy 5 months. 5 months since i came to your door, and rang the doorbell, and the dog howled at me.
5 months since you got called a boy stealer over me.
tomorrow morning after i wake up ill make my way across the desert to the one i love. she needs some comforting that only i can give, and i understand what i have to do.
it wasnt even a question whether or not i was going, even though i was acting like i was staying in AZ.

i know i can stay here and be fine. i can handle a weekend away from her, but i dont HAVE to. 
it is ok for me to go, and actually cheaper than getting the tattoo, and frankly more important to me, even if it is only going to be for saturday night.

abby you make me feel alive.
i love you.
see you saturday<3"

sometimes you need a good kick in the ass to get you going in a different direction, a direction that may help you better yourself. or i might ruin myself.

all i have is hope
lets try this thing again when we can<3"

"event","im so content with life while i live out one of the saddest scenarios conceivable. there has never been a more tragic and glorious relationship in existence. up or down?
at least hearing the harsh reality of the situation, and being educated on my sweet disposition can only make me a better person......right?
or will it make me weak and feeble, able to feel intense pain again.

all i know is i love you
all i dont know is if you love me"

"event","yesterday at work. i was cutting this guys hair. and eventually he told me he was the singer from that band the tokens.(they sang that in the jungle song... something about a lion sleeping) it was crazy man.
then at basketball i rocked everyone, saying crazy shit. well, i guess i played drunk.
man, only about 6 more days and ill be back in california. i cant stress how much i am anxiously awaiting this.
oh, and i got bugged a lot by people at matt's work. 
here is the best convo i remember.
random lady: did that hurt?
me: what.. when i fell from heaven?
random lady: that too, but i was talking about your ears.. did that hurt.. when they... did that?
me: oh.. no not really.
random lady: some guy who gave me a tattoo had the middle of his nose pierced. he said it was the most painful piercing possible.. it looked it.
me: oh no way!(as i pull down my septum retainer)
random lady: oh my. there it is!
me: its actually one of the most painless piercings you can have. there is a ""sweet spot"" separating the nasal cavities. no cartilage at all, it makes for a rather simple piercing with little or no pain. it would only be painfull if done in the wrong spot. such as low, and through the cartilage. most of the girl i know do, or have had their septum pierced.
random lady: oh...thanks, i think thats wheely kewl guyz :::walks out of store:::


oh yeah..
abby you make me crazy and i love it."

ive never fallen for somebody this hard before. i love it... but it freaks me out at the same time. ive gone through the long distance shit before. ive been through shitty people. ive been shitty to people before. but i never felt this way about them. just stick with me, and i truly believe everything will work out<3"

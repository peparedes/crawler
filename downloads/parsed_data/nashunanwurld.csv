"event","it's not the principle of being tagged that I loathe so much as I just dislike this topic: ""five weird habits of mine""

only five? 

here goes

1. I have not, cannot, and will not ever get into bed after 11:30 PM while at school. I think this habit began in freshman year, when Mr. Washington really didn't give me a choice. If I have a shitload of work, I do not think it will be all right because I can stay up late... a la normal people. Instead, I think it will be disastrous because jesus christ it's already 6:30 and I only have five hours until lights out!!!!!!!! 

2. I have a very Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets-like habit of getting ready for school. Shower: first acne wash, second soap, third shampoo. After shower: first deodorant, second Q-Tip, third acne cream, (possible) fourth shave. Getting dressed: first underwear, second t-shirt, third pants, fourth over-shirt, fifth socks. Nothing ever gets done in any other order. 

3. I always take a piss between third and fourth periods, and always in the Mem Hall bathroom. 

4. I have a habit of shooting nasty looks at Hattie Huston from across the table in history class. I also have a habit of looking away right before she catches me. 

5. I have a habit of bringing things to school I will never need or use: golf clubs, short-sleeved oxford shirts, bathing suits, calendars, blank CDs, etc. 

I don't have five lj friends to tag, since the only three I know have been tagged. Oh, I tag talekyn, if he still reads this lj (which would be difficult, since I don't update this lj)."

1. Our Song - Paul Hammer..... the guy that played at lville a while ago, he's pretty bad, ask sean.  

2. What You Own - Rent....... I could just say I'm listening to the whole soundtrack, but I discovered this song and like it. it's so anachronistic. 

3. Grace - Jeff Buckley........ Listening to whole album, but this song's the best. 

4. Rescue - Eve 6...... I don't get it. ""Like Jessica Rabbit, she corrects that habit."" Those are the worst lyrics ever. 

5. Satisfaction - Benny Benassi....... Only techno song I've ever heard=Best techno song ever."

"event","joe cha tagged me... i think it's really cute that i'm basically the only l'viller joe ever mentions on his lj. 

hidden meaning in these 10 songs.... They all have something in common. Guess what it is. Or just scroll down, cheater. 

1. Good People - Jack Johnson

This song is so cheesy. Who made Jack Johnson the judge of people's character?

2. Banana Pancakes - Jack Johnson

Last JJ song, I promise. I just like that part where he goes ""makin banana pancakes"" in that really funny voice... joe and sean know. 

3. Such Great Heights - The Postal Service

I played this song for a bunch of 11 year olds at jew camp, and even those goddamn mini-eminems loved it. 

4. Call on Me - Eric Prydz

I can't listen to this without cracking up. And Anthony can't listen to it without popping a stiffie. 

5. Collide - Howie Day

This song is just so chill. It's like JJ and Jason Mraz combined into a sweet, crunchy, salty, tangy mess of goodness. 

6. 100 Years - Five for Fighting

I love that Chase commercial with the couple that keeps aging and gets a different credit card for every stage of life. 

7. Leave (Get Out) - Jojo

This song exudes Joe-ness. For next year's banquet performance, Joe, I recommend some Jojo. 

8. Girl - Beck

To answer your question about the lyrics, Joe, I believe at some point he says ""sun-eyed girl"" over and over again. That's about all I made out. 

9. Cartwheels - The Reindeer Sections
""I'm doin cartwheels...I'm doin cartwheels...I'm doin cartwheels...I'm doin cartwheels...I'm doin carthwheels... I'm doin cartwheels...I'm doin cartwheels...""

10. Last Night - The Strokes

I can't listen to this song anymore. That's cuz I listened to it 100 times in a row the last night of school trying to cover the sounds of Cody's music above me. It didn't work, and I'll never forgive the Strokes for not adding more loud bass lines.


If you guessed that what these songs have in common is that I stole them from Joe's computer during study hall while he was jacking off in nate's room, you're right."

i feel so old... especially compared to little anthony, who's as young (yet not nearly as fresh) as an april daffodil. hooray for not so subtle virginity references. 

double hooray for completely mimicking anthony's lj-posting style. 

i got a cell phone... finally. i didnt ask for it, but its a camera phone. my grandma seemed to think the picture quality was similar to a digital camera (and thought herself quite clever for combining two expensive gifts into one). i didnt have the heart to tell her how grainy and shitty the photos are.

what's that? you didn't realize i was gone? screw you, buddy! 

so i figure it's time for one of my infamous political rants, which i have eschewed for a while in the name of netflix and dial-up internet that doesn't facillitate easy access to andrewsullivan.com. (that sentence was needlessly complicated.) 

so sandra o'connor resigned from the supreme court. i would say good riddance, she wasn't so great, if only for the fact that whoever bush nominates will be ten times worse. since bush will undoubtedly nominate an anti-abortion activist, that will make the court only 5-4 in favor of roe v wade. and since one of those 87 year old liberals there is bound to die sometime soon, we could actually see a reversal of roe before the next election. which would mean all abortions would come under the jurisdictions of whatever state laws were present before 1973. which means no abortions for many red-staters. this is worst case scenario of course, and i can't remember why i care about abortion, as i don't actually have ovaries. (although, as joe cha has noted, i do tend to get my panties in a bunch.) 

in other news, fucking fox and msnbc will not stop talking about natalee (who the hell spells it that way?) holloway.... which i naturally attribute to their fanatical attraction to southern blondes. or, perhaps they just love any story that can distract people from the war, and the fact that bush's approval ratings are much lower than clinton's during his impeachment and nixon's during watergate. (not to mention coolidge's during his infamous monkey sex scandal) 

and does anyone really think michael jackson was innocent?"

"event","I've pretty much had the worst week ever. 

Actually, just the worst two days ever. 

Yesterday during our house softball game I totally flipped at the ump (although, in my defense, not without just cause). So now everyone thinks I'm an ultra-competitive, arrogant asshole (and I wonder why it took them so long to figure this out). 

Also yesterday, I had to write this really boring article for the Lawrence, and to make it fun I inserted a rather tame insult about one of my subjects. (Well, it was pretty insulting, but worse things have been said about fat people than that they ""waddle."") So anyway, like an moron I forgot to delete this joke from my submission to the editor, and since the butt of my joke is one of the editors, this was a costly mistake. The editor-in-chief told the faculty advisor, and also decided to mention my earlier softball-related indiscretions. So now I have about five editors angry at me, plus the faculty advisor, who has some big pull in deciding the editors next year. 

That was yesterday. Today, my freaking day off, I spent worrying about the damage I'd done and doing my best to control it. Sent an apology to the ump and to the editor I offended. Not that either will do any good. Like I said, bad couple days."

2. you're the laziest piece of shit i know. if you ever move, it's to grab the pool cue we use as a remote. it amazes me that you still pull off better grades than half the school, since you're always late with assignments and you never put your heart into them. someday you'll realize that to be truly happy, you might have to work (just a little, i promise!). 

3. you piss me off sometimes, i'm not gonna lie. some of your jokes are downright offensive, but i don't complain much because i'd be a hypocrite. i know you're a really nice person deep down, otherwise i wouldn't go in your room all the time. who am i kidding? keep the jokes coming. 

4. you wouldn't hurt a fly, and that's admirable. you're too nice for your own good sometimes. but god damnit, i want to kill you every time you give me that stupid pained grin. and i think it's bullshit that you get all the easy teachers because of your, ahem, disadvantage. i hate to sound arrogant (or do I?) but you'd never get better grades than me if we were in the same classes. damn you.

5. you cock-muncher. you might be the worst essay grader in the world. you can't even recognize when one person's writing is simply better than another's. all you care about is whether the argument is perfectly tied up and supported, when that's really not possible for literary amateurs. so you take off a whole letter grade for one little loose end. ass. 

6. you're the worst umpire in the history of the world. not only were you vocally supporting the other team when they were batting, your calls were consistently against us and for cleve. you actually managed to make up a rule that cost us a run. (and that matters when the score is 21-20) And everytime cleve was slow getting back into position, you'd hold up the game to wait. but when we complained that our outfielders hadn't even gotten to their positions before the pitcher pitched and the batter hit a home run, you completely ignored us. so yeah, i jawed my mouth off at you, and you damn well deserved it. 

7. you're unbelievably nice, but not in the annoying way of number 4. you work hard, too hard perhaps, and you still manage to enjoy yourself all the time. way to go.

Here's the personal email I sent to the retarded writer at the Trentonian who was knocking the ""snobby"" Lawrenceville kids who leered at his hot girlfriend: 

Jeff,
A preliminary question before we get down to the nitty gritty: are you delusional? Do you really think your ""looker"" girlfriend gets different looks in front of Trenton or Princeton High? It's the price you pay for having such a great-looking girlfriend: horny teenagers will leer at her. Deal with it, and have pride that you actually know her and we don't. But for the love of God don't insult our school or my fellow students.

You make such a gigantic leap in logic by equating our entire student body with one stingy, sloppy-haired kid. (I hope you realize, however, that since we live at school, it's often difficult to get sufficient funds for even one delivered pizza. Many of us come from wealth, but it doesn't mean we all have thick wallets to draw from.) I also hope you know (well, I know you know, but you conveniently ignore this fact) that many, if not most, of our students are on financial aid. Sure, they buy Abercrombie shirts to fit in, but it doesn't mean they have a house in the Hamptons.

And what if they did? (I don't, nor do I know anyone who does.) Would it make them evil, snooty, and stingy? Quite possibly. But not automatically, as you imply. Do you think any other local high school does half the community service we do? And don't you think some of that community service stems from the fact that we see the necessity in giving back after being given so much?

I don't know your politics, but your attack on rich people smacks of confused liberalism. I'm personally the President of the Young Democrats here, but I can't condone such blatant stereotyping, which I consider on par with someone who assumed that all black people hanging out in South Philly must be criminal thugs. You're ignorant, not racist, but certainly ignorant. 

Sincerely,
Sam Barr"

"event","anything i say to rebut you will be retorted with ""that's just cuz you're in wood with him"" but i'm sorry to say that raaj did deserve president. 

first of all, a logical argument. if school elections are popularity contests and they usually go to the jokers (read: ted keller), and this election was between an effective comedian (although pincus's jokes were lame, ""stay classy, lawrenceville""? make up your own shit man!) and a serious guy, then why didn't the joker win? mustn't there be some legitimate excuse to vote for the serious guy despite ted keller and justian pincus being such effective funny guys? 

let me retort you other points in willy-nilly order:

so raaj wasn't wood president, that's cuz house elections ALWAYS go to the jokers, and dustin has been a perfect house president as such. raaj was veep, not to mention becoming news editor of the lawrence (and being offered editor in chief). 

and you say nobody sees him around campus? frankly, i don't think i've seen pincus around campus once this year,but it doesn't mean he's not there. it doesn't say anything about him as a potential president. if i weren't in your english class anthony, i wouldn't see you all day either. where else do i ever see you? it's a tragedy of the house system. 

yes, raaj fucked up when he said ""i won't make any promises."" what he meant were unreasonable promises. what i can promise you is that raaj gets very worked up about things, he rants about the no food after 830 rule, he rants about fobs. he's soft-spoken (although everyone agrees he spoke very well today) but it doesn't mean he's not committed to changing the school for the better. 

lack of campaign promises? read his platform. what about the day student crap? what about the board of trustees crap? students know about the 830 rule and the fob system and the house dances, they know the next president will need to address that. (and forgive me if i'm mistaken, but raaj definitely listed those three as things he would like to change.) they want to hear something original. raaj had it. 

pincus=funny and charming and approachable. what debate were you watching? pincus' jokes fell flat, i mean, people laughed, but raaj's jokes were self-deprecating and original. all i heard from pincus was ""i will stand up here and make good jokes"" and i never heard a decent example. 

and you know what's really charming? spreading your legs for the whole school to view your crotch for 30 minutes. yeah, he's real approachable. 

besides, i thought going into this that raaj had to stress the approachability factor, as he did. he's soft-spoken, but he's one of the nicest guys around. and you can tell, since he's not the popular stud that pincus is, that he will be open to anyone. guys like pincus (ie popular loudmouths) get bigheaded when you give them responsibility. and even if im not right about pincus, i think that this conception was widespread, and probably not without some reason. 

also, you make fun of how raaj would promise something, then make a joke, then talk about day students. but then you seem to defend pincus being ""funny and charming"" as characteristics that should have earned him points. so which is it? is raaj allowed to make jokes, or is only pincus, the supposed funnyman, allowed? 

and raaj, despite his appearance, is not timid, as he noted. he has confronted the administration about many things, and at times i thought his rhetoric today was nearly insulting to dean gracey. he has done countless interviews with the ad for the lawrence, he's already talked up his proposals with the headmaster, yet you still say he wouldn't do anything. huh. 

and the email thing, i wanted to scream at pincus. that's the stupidest idea ever. does he think anybody will use that? look at the message boards on blackboard. or did you not know they existed? they were implemented for the exact same reason, and have not been touched since last year. this is not a direct democracy. we elect people, we tell those people what we care about, they argue it for us. and raaj i think had the edge on being approachable. i wouldn't come near pincus if all he's going to do is show me his crotch and quote anchorman. 

finally, if you want to rebut, you can start by detailing HOW pincus outlined his plans, cuz he must not have done it well since i only remember the email thing. oh, and how has he ""done so much"" for dickinson. these are things you could actually use to strengthen an argument, rather than just saying it and hoping it sticks. 

last thing, raaj's good grades and editorship do indicate an ability to represent us. just to clarify that. 

last last thing, i dont think you have anything to worry about with the school meetings. raaj is a genuinely funny guy, he gets a bad rap for being quiet, but force him to speak and he'll entertain you. that's it."

"event","Unless you've been in  a persistent vegetative state for the last few days, you've heard of Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman who has been in (you guessed it!) a persistent vegetative state for 15 years. That means she can't communicate, she can't feed herself, and she has very limited response to stimuli (ie following the movements of a balloon). Her quality of life, everybody can agree, is very poor. 

The conflict is between her husband Michael, who says that Terri wished not to be kept artificially alive, and Terri's parents, who insist that Terri has hope of rehabilitation (an outrageously optimistic hope without basis in medicine). The case has been litigated numerous times (40 judges have ruled!!!), in every case the courts have ruled in favor of Terri's husband. One time last year, Gov. Jeb Bush and Repubs in Florida invented a law specifically designed to keep Terri alive. This was ruled to be an abuse of executive power, and the judge AGAIN ordered that Terri's feeding tube be removed.

Today, that finally happened. But Congress has tried sneaky ways to stall the process (calling Terri as a witness in her own defense!!!). They might try to enact a similar law to the one Florida passed that applies only to Terri, and to no one else. 

Here's the deal: the matter of life or death is a matter for the courts. It was litigated, and appealed, and litigated again.The courts have ruled that the husband's evidence is valid, that Terri really did request to not be kept alive artifically. Why should Congress be able to intervene? Interestingly, the same conservatives who purport to be for individual rights and state rights are now supporting federal intervention. The truth about these hypocrites is that they support state rights when the states cut entitlement benefits and social programs, but they support federal intervention when they want to discriminate against gays, and deny medical marijuana, and force braindead women to live."

"event","i got a beef with hollywood, at it's not that they're a bunch of liberal weinies (being one myself, i cannot talk). THEIR MOVIES SUCK!!! every decent movie is either made independently, made by a small studio, or, if it's under a big studio, that's only because some risk-takers like the weinsteins pressured the studio to buy it. look at the shit that comes out every week: ""the pacifier"", ""are we there yet?"", ""cursed"",""be cool"", ""constantine"", ""man of the house"",""the jacket"", ""because of winn dixie"", ""the wedding date."" these are the types of movies that are at the top of the box-office every fucking weekend. maybe the problem is the consumers, because they watch this shit, and then when they're on dvd, they rent this shit! i was in blockbuster last night (got original ""manchurian candidate"", ""kill bill 2"", ""a clockwork orange"", and ""control room"" (docu bout al jazeera) what was everybody else getting? ""the notebook"", ""raise your voice"", ""taxi"", ""shark tale"", ""saw"", etc. either people don't read critics anymore, or they are so stupid that they flaunt the warnings and pay good money to see shit anyway, assuming ""this time wes craven's horror film HAS to be good."" NO MORON, WRONG!! i think that people honestly don't believe the critics; they say to themselves, ""what does this guy know about movies that i don't?"" then they come out of the theater, and if they're honest they'll admit they were wrong, but more likely they'll pretend to have enjoyed it and will continue on in their blissful world of cinematic idiocy. it's like there are only two sets of movies that hollywood churns out: there is the dreck, the bottom-of-the-barrel dog vomit that makes up 90% of all new releases and 99.9% of all ticket sales. then there are the oscar-contenders, which are released sometime in october (sideways, vera drake, ray) and then only become popular in march, after the awards show validates them. god forbid you see an edgy or arty or in any way intelligent movie without being prodded by the grandeur of the oscars!! FUCK HOLLYWOOD, and fuck the 200 pound soccer mom behemoths who waddle through blockbuster with their 15 pound keychains and 40 ounce coffee mugs, debating on whether to rent ""the notebook"" or ""taxi"". what a bunch of pricks."

"event","For those who don't watch fox news as religiously as i do (for a larf, not cuz i like it), you might not have heard of ward churchill. he's this professor at colorado university who has been attacked by the right-wing media for saying that the CIA,  Defense Department, and certain military corporations that were located in the World Trade Center were ""legitimate targets"" for al Qaeda. 

On first sight, his comments seemed outrageous. But he is applying the same standard of legitimizing targets that the US military does in Iraq. We bomb buildings that contain both terrorist cells and civilians all the time. If the hijackers believed the CIA and DoD to be terrorist organizations (I disagree, but considering the regimes that the two have propped up, that's understandable.), then their attacks were technically a military, not terrorist, act. This reasoning doesn't change the necessity of the War on Terror. In fact, it really doesn't change anything. It really isn't a particularly interesting or dangerous idea, but it's been totally blown up by the right-wing media. 

Meanwhile, the false reporter who gained access to the White House press room and fed softball questions to the President.... no, his story is never mentioned."

"event","today's political musings:

the supremo court outlawed executions of juvenile criminals, meaning i can do whatever i want!!!!!!!!! 

seriously, this is a great first step towards outlawing the entire death penalty. it actually costs twice as much to execute criminals (thanks to the appeals process) than it does to keep them in prison for life. 

as for the idea that the death penalty deters future criminals.... why does almost every Western country have a lower crime rate than the US, despite having outlawed the death penalty? are they just nicer in Europe, or is the death penalty a bogus deterrant? i say both. 

finally, conservatives blather on about the ""culture of life"" when it comes to abortion, but they forget their beloved commandmants (hello, ""thou shalt not kill"") when it comes to criminals. the only reason they support execution is because it makes them feel tough on crime when they really want to hand out machine guns in school. fucking assholes...."

Here's the article: http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w050221&s=zimmerman022505

If you're a lazy shit, it's about this book by some popular evangelist, and the reviewer goes over the seven points ""to lead a better life"" and points out the hypocrisy, inaccuracy, and downright stupidity of them all. 

Among the suggestions this preacher makes: 

That we should randomly offer to pay the check for strangers in a restaurant........... I assumed if you're at a restaurant, you can afford it.

That we should repress unhappy memories: ""We need to learn to mentally flip channels when negative images of the past pop up in our minds unexpectedly."" And I thought dealing with problems was the way to go, silly me! 

That ""When you get stuck in traffic, you can choose to be mad and frustrated, or you can choose to say, 'Father, I thank you for guiding me and protecting me and keeping me in your perfect will.'"" Wow, that never occurred to me. 

My favorite retort by the reviewer: After the preacher argues that ""God wants to increase you financially, by giving you promotions, fresh ideas, and creativity,"" she says ""Didn't Jesus extol the virtues of living in poverty?"" Why yes, but damn he musta hated those queers!"

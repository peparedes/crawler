"event","Lately I feel like I have been constantly cheating on my girlfriend...when I have free time I should be filling it up with constant, or at least near-constant gaming, however, when I have a free night to myself I tend to fall down the rabbit's hole of youtube videos, eventually coming to a point where I just feel that even booting up the ole' PS2 and playing a game would be too much of a chore. This is bad news, my friends. Gaming is pretty much the greatest passion of my life, has been for years; lame as that sounds, as of late I have been neglecting my love, replacing her with a cheap whore that provides simply the most fleeting and superficial of thrills. Time to get back to basics, I say YouTube, you filthy, dirty little slut, you!! Our engagement must end, for I have a sturdy black box which beckons my attentions once again. This blog shall no longer go untended, gathering cobwebs and becoming yet another in a long line of unfinished projects in Forrests past! PLAY ON!!!!"

In reference to my prior, angry, caps locked sentence: for those not ""in the know"", Jaffe announced last year that he no longer has any desire to personally oversee the God of War series which he has created, nor to design any large scale games any time in the near future.&nbsp; Mr. Jaffe's decision, however, is a discussion for another time. What remains important, now, for the sake of this review, is not the story of Jaffe, but the second coming of his angst ridden, chain-blade wielding creation: Kratos. (Warning: Spoilers ahead!)<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/0000hc93/""><img width=""320"" height=""170"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/0000hc93/s320x240"" /></a><br />God of War 2 opens with Kratos&nbsp; being stripped of his powers as the God of War he had become through defeating Ares in the first game. Zeus, drunk with power and under the false pretense that Kratos is unfit for leadership of his people, strips him of his powers and, in the vein of the first game, Kratos is killed in the opening moments of the game, only this time by a hand other than his own. This all builds towards an even more disgruntled Kratos seeking yet more revenge against the gods. And what gods they are. You can tell the developers really mined the Greek mythology in the boss battles for this one. Where the first iteration had you fighting such staples as the hydra and the cerberus, some more obscure mythos finds it's way into God of War 2. Whoever imagined they might one day be virtually fighting a three-story tall, bulbous, pissed off Clotho...well, those people are probably a bit too ""distracted"" to be actually playing this game. <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/0000ka93/""><img width=""290"" height=""201"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/0000ka93"" /></a><br />As far as gameplay is concerned, God of War 2 doesn't necessarily stray too far from it's source material, but the bitch most certainly ain't broke and instead of giving her a complete overhaul, the developers simply improve, exponentially, on what worked so well in the first place: ""you don't even notice 'em they're so damn solid"" controls, immense, completely insane boss fights (in this game, almost nonstop), and some good, ole' fashioned brutal, gory, brutal, hardcore, brutal (did I mention brutal, cause that's how it feels, pretty damn brutal) violence. The chains, of course, are back, and like in the first game, you will find yourself resorting back to them no matter how many weapons you may eventually unlock. This, unfortunately, becomes the ultimate drawback of the game. While it attempts to ""Metroid"" you of your powers/weapons only to gain them back once again, the same sense of exploration for the amazing powers you experience at the outset simply isn't as rewarding. The weapons you will eventually acquire become little else than short lived, destructive thrills, but end up in the neglected menu graveyard and cannot even come close to comparing to the fun you will have with the chains...oh and fun you will have. Graphically, it is not only what one would expect of the series, but honestly, a game has absolutely no business looking this damned good on the PS2. The storytelling and voice acting is again top-notch (especially with academy award winning actress Elizabeth Ashely at the helm as narrator again), with some amazing in-game segments that create an atmosphere that most games could only hope to achieve with even the largest of budgets and the most slavishly produced cut-scenes. <br /><font size=""5""><b>GAMEPLAY: 4/4<br />GRAPHICS: 4/4<br />STORY: 4/4<br />REPLAY: 3/4<br /><br />OVERALL: 4/4<br /><br /></b></font>"

About a week ago I went to my local GameStop to purchase a PS2 for the 5th time (though I do believe the first one was a Christmas present, we'll just ignore that detail for the sake of the blog) I felt it fitting to chronicle the long, sad history of my many Playstations:<br /><u><b><br />Numero Uno:</b></u><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Location: 31 North Hubbard Hall</b>, <b>MSU, East Lansing, MI<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>At the time I was a fresh faced, fresh man living with a Sophomore whose family had amassed such exorbitant wealth that if he were to quote you actual figures, your face would melt right off your head. A super rich kid from a super rich Arab family straight outta Dubai, I knew my roomate could not have possibly been involved in the heist. Upon returning from the worst Spring Break of my life, and after consuming ungodly amounts of THC, my roomate, Saud, and I suddenly realized that something was amiss...<br /><b><br />Saud: </b>""Hey, did you, like, um, take your PS2 up north?<br /><b>Me: </b>""Ummmm.....er....no, I don't think so, why?<br /><b>Saud: </b>""Isn't it, like, usually next to the TVish area?<br /><b>Me: </b>""Er, yeah, um, it is, isn't it? Where the fuck is it?""<br /><br />.....and scene. So the next day I had to have a mother loving MSU cop come and file a report, as we had soon discovered many other things had gone missing (including, of all things, the fucking Swiffer sweeper thing, I mean, come on, honestly...) and the dumb asshole pig did nothing but give the room a cursory glance and then make me return the wet floor sign we had stolen and apologize to the front desk worker (as if she gave half of a French fried fuck about it). As you could imagine, no arrests were made in the case of the first missing PS2.<br /><br /><u><b># 2:</b></u><b>&nbsp; Location: 637 North Foster Rd., Lansing, MI<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Living with heroin addicts is risky business, believe you me.&nbsp; <br /><b><br /><u>The Thirdish One:</u> Location: hmmm, holy shit, lemme guess...637 North Foster Rd., Lansing, MI,&nbsp; maybe??!?!?!?!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Well, seeing as how I learn from my previous mistakes so well, I decided that letting yet another heroin addict (yet one whose addictions and personal problems ran a much more colorful gamut) move into the house just weeks after ridding myself of the last two junkies would be a fantastic idea. Unfortunately we all have different ideas of what fantastic ideas are...'nuff said.<br /><br /><u><b>Fourth time's a charm?:</b></u><b> Location: 637 North Foster AND 31 East Owen Hall, MSU, East Lansing<br /></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I happened to get super lucky that my friend Josh Niederer (who just so happens to be creating the artwork for my new site) just happened to be stuck in Lansing with no gas money to get back to good ole' G-town and just happened to need exactly 25 bucks and just happened to have an old PS2 which had just so happened to have been partially melted by his neglect of a hot plate he had left burning on top of it. Long story short I bought the damaged goods which actually turned out to be the longest I owned a working Playstation 2, till, ya know, it turned into a non-working PS2...<br /><br />...which brings us to lucky number <b>5</b>, which is currently providing endless enjoyment playing such hits as Final Fantasy XII, Soul Caliber III, and Half-Life! Seeing as how the house I am currently living in was recently broken into for such fan favorites as ""Dual Bike Robbery"" and ""Attempted Pharmaheist"", I give this one a good three months of gamer lovin' before I finally retire it to theftery heaven. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","Just figured I'd post some links to some of my favorite and oft visited Gaming related sites...hopefully soon I can post these as a constant sidebar to my blog, but until I can figure out how to do so...here ya go:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.gametrailers.com""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 336px; height: 43px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/00009s0d/s320x240"" /></a><br />www.gametrailers.com<br />Though, as the title suggests, this site does indeed have a near endless amount of video game previews to peruse, it is home to much, much more. Here, you can access game reviews, retrospectives, exclusive interviews, the list goes on. Easily one of my most visited web sites.<br /><br /><a href=""www.newgrounds.com""><img width=""120"" height=""120"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/0000a1k7"" /></a><br />www.newgrounds.com<br />""Everything by Everyone."" Think of this site as the YouTube of user-created flash games and animations. I've been visiting this for somewhere close to a decade now and still can't get enough. It's been really cool to see the evolution of what one can do with flash and some of the submissions to this site are truly awe-inspiring (especially when taking into consideration that these are entires created usually by only one or two people with ZERO budget.) Definitely, definitely, check this one out, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. More on this amazing site to come...<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/0000b4p4/""><img width=""320"" height=""40"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/0000b4p4/s320x240"" /></a><br />www.screwattack.com<br />""Something original...Every freakin' day."" This site loads kinda slow, but it's totally worth it.

We have a special guest today, one for whom women routinely tear off their clothes, even sometimes their skin in their fervor for his much sought after attentions.....JOSH PETRIE!!!  The following is the best we could possibly come up with in our current states...
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/00004d9a/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/00004d9a/s320x240"" width=""169"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
After a heated debate over what this blog would concern, we fell upon a game which has made the rhythm genre dominated by Dance Dance Revolution seem kinda cool...almost. Guitar Hero, currently residing happily in the palms of those whom a real guitar finds itself far too unruly and requiring something true gamers find themselves incapable of mastering. It gives those too lazy to truly learn a skill beyond the joypad the feeling of a rock star. Or at least that's the intention. But does it really, truly recreate that sensation? FUCK YEAH it does!!! 
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/00005bc4/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/00005bc4/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""224"" border='0'/></a>
A testimonial from our man Josh P (a man who actually can play a guitar as well as a joypad, sometimes simultaneously): ""Having rocked out on the real stage, I find that Guitar Hero sometimes actually sounds better than the real thing..."" by this I can only assume that he either means to say that he sucks at the actual guitar (which he doesn't deny) or that the control interfacing with the actual songs is so tight that one feels that he is genuinely thrashing a given song note for note. Guitar Hero is beyond a doubt one of the most amazingly addictive pastimes which truly transcends the realm of gaming and infuses itself in the entertainment genre as not something deemed a VIDEO game, but more as an easily accessible party game unto itself, possibly one day ranking with such standards as kareoke and monopoly (a quality developer Red Octane hopes to further with their upcoming release Rock Band, but more on that later). As Josh Petrie simply and eloquently puts it: ""Guitar Hero is the Balls!""

      Here's a name I had hoped to forget, a name that inspires rage and rage and rage and choler (yeah, I looked it up in the online thesaurus, it's totally a word, and a pretty kick-ass one, at that) and, well, an all too familiar twinge of disgust and resentment bubbled up in my sphinctometer. So intense, in fact, that I felt not only an urge to take an angry, massive shit, but also to contemplate writing a blog about taking said angry shit (never happened, too much cheese I assume, binds ya up from what I hear). For those not in that super awesome realm we all know as ""the know"", Jack Thompson is an ignorant douchebag whom a fictional specter in the sky deemed his puppet for explaining to the human race in the simplest of terms that anyone who plays video games is very likely to take his cock and or nearest sharp object and immediately place it in the nearest, tightest, youngest orifice he can find; preferably an object of the youngish and boyish persuasion (though this may also refer to those of the inanimate fruit peel sect as well, but I digress...). Aside from all this, the evil fuck has the audacity to share my last name, so for me, it's personal not only on the deepest level possible (my passion for gaming), but on the most extremely unimportant and superficial as well.......
        <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/00002ceb/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thomp592/pic/00002ceb"" width=""200"" height=""200"" border=""0"" /></a>
        Jack Thompson is that of a breed which I wish I could call rare, though in doing so would be stating a blatant inaccuracy. Yet he takes his medium of intolerance and self-righteousness to a whole new LEVEL (heh-heh, funny...cause, like, games have levels and he hates gay people and pictures that move, and most likely assumes Pac Man was a primary cause of 9/11 and ya know, flagellates/roughly masturbates himself anytime he comes in contact with anything that is digitized and causes him erections for which he feels shame). I suppose I should really start at the beginning, however, so take this fingertype as an introduction to a series on an intolerant asshole we all wish we could just wish away, yet at the same time, is the real world level boss we all seek to overcome."

"event","""Games lubricate the body and the mind.""
                      - Benjamin Franklin

   The encyclopedia describes the video game as ""a game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device"" and a gamer as simply ""a person who enjoys playing computer and video games"". I describe the video game as ""a wholly misunderstood, underestimated and supremely intricate, captivating art form of which few fully appreciate and most are ignorant"" and the gamer as ""a wholly misunderstood, underestimated and supremely intricate, captivating individual of whom few fully appreciate and most are ignorant."" This blog is intended not only for those who have already come to realize the brilliance of this art form (surprisingly still in its infancy, in the grand scheme of things), but also to inform those who have yet to realize it or still deny its relevance and power. That or, ya know, just satisfy my inner geek and perhaps spare those around me who are constantly subjected to my unceasing diatribes on the state of the industry and my latest gaming obsessions.
     So, with that in mind, behold FILTERED PIXELZ, which I spell with a Z because being totally awesome and extremely extreme cool to the max just runs in my veins. That or I am a complete tool. Herein you will find my very own special blend of gaming news, reviews, experiences and daily ruminations on gaming, video games, gaming people, stuff about gamers, stuff about me (a gamer), gaming stuff, consoles on which to run video games and upon which gamers game and then the occasional dick or fart joke, just for good measure. SO, here we go, let's go ahead and just see if I'm not too lazy to let you enjoy: FILTERED PIXELZ."

Beltane was two nights ago.  Incredible night, some good photos of us White Warrior Women here 
 'http://two-truths.livejournal.com/391432.html', but in my head it's already been overshadowed by the news from Kyrgyzstan. And that my exams start a week today, and if i realistically want to stay at Uni i can't fail any more.

But anyway!  A happy, happy few days :-)"

"event","i have about an hour left to write an essay so of course this is the perfect time to update my journal..

it doesn't matter really as i'm getting closer and closer to the idea of leaving uni.. academia doesn't seem quite right for me yet/ever.  so for the moment i'm appreciating learning without worrying about marks, and having fun like bringing in fair trade to ensuring human rights... or talking about Bilston Glen as a sustainability venture for edinburgh uni...

beltane rehearsals have started again, i'm hopefully going to be a white woman and it all feels very exciting, such a beautiful role.  so much dedication is going to be necessary but i feel like i need it too, something to be passionate about and use my energy for.   

and the sun is starting to peek out, it's making me glow, anticipation for an amazing spring and adventure-full summer... and a future of possibilities.

the eve of my eighteenth, so i thought i'd have a few friends round for a nice intimate meal.. well, seventeen-ish people is still kinda intimate, yeah?  my saying 'bring a dish or a bottle' winded me up with quite a few bottles of red wine... not that i'm complaining of course  

with yummy food cooked by andrew, katharine, anna & jo, and a glorious toad in the hole which served as my birthday cake, we celebrated the night in very mixed company.. perfect later for 'never have i ever' as a drinking game.. my drink of choice was pink ginger cordial diluted with vodka... such a good invention!

so we all shared lots and learnt more.. many interesting conversations have already followed from the things we have done - a good thing i'm sure?

at some point after eleven we all left the flat and made our way to calton hill, red wine and cheap baileys in hand.. lost everyone and found them all sometime after the fireworks.. speaking of the fireworks, they were truly beautiful..  then looked over all across edinburgh surrounded by lovely lovely people... one missing of course, so i called mr will and was ridiculously drunk on the phone to him... anyway..

at some point a load of us starting walking down the hill, to what ended up being a party with forest people in the innocent railway.. by the time we got there our group had filtered down to tessa, katharine, andrew and i, but we met lots of fabulous people there... danced and danced and drunkenly chatted and ran up and down the tunnel and danced and got very dirty somehow..(??)

left there at four-ish and on the walk home across the meadows we stumbled across a chrsitmas tree sticking out of a bin.. the poor thing... so andrew picks it up and declares we need one for the flat, and 'happy birthday amy' and proceeds the carry this monstrosity for about 20 minutes then up to the fourth floor for me.. bless him.  home safe and in the hall we wrap my duckie lights around it and wake up (by dragging out of bed...) people staying in the flat. after admiring our handiwork we sit and chat for a bit but i'm falling asleep on the sofa and go to bed sometime after five.. tessa crawling in with me about an hour later..

wake up bright and early at nine-ish to see then ends of a beautiful pink sunrise and can't get back to sleep.. occupy myself till half two by which time everyone's up and we go for a (lengthy!) walk up blackford hill and frolick in the woods.. about five hours later we head back to andrews flat and see some lovely people and have a well-deserved shisha puff and coconut-milk stir fry... mm 

then back to to my flat for a grand clean-up and watch of flashdance (thanks b!) in katharines bed where i get birthday cake and chocolates courtesy of amy and ross... my sister turns up just before midnight, to give me a beautiful 'faery door' and we crash out utterly for ten hours..."

"event","okay, as this is my last time on the internet for a while i should maybe explain a little what i'm up to

was working in a beautiful vegie restaraunt and hotel in a tiny village in normandy for two months, met some incredible people and have very very many memories..

went to paris for 4 nights, spent lots of time with a lovely new friend, paris to me was stunning but overwhelming, busy, scary, the first place i was alone really and just a bit much too deal with...  

hid out in a chatau in nancy for a night after spending way too much money on a fine after pretending to be a 23 year old ukrainian woman called irina krashkevno or something.. really bad story there, anyway..

a few days in strasbourg which i loved, quiet beautiful old city and on my last night FIREWORKS oh i love them so..

left france the next day to lauf, which is just outside nurnberg, stayed with some family friends so a proper bed, really good food, a random turkish friend of theirs daughter taking me out for shisha smoking and cocktails it was a pretty good few days all in all

then off to stay with their son in leipzig, whose now 25 and i haven't seen since i was about 11 or 12 and had a huge crush on him, embarrassment.  but now i was all adult and we made stories about giants and secret passageways underthe lake by the golden coin, and got pissed and i know its silly, but im so proud i managed to keep up with the beer-drinking of two german student guys... woo 

and then i got too berlin... but sorry i must be of, shit this has taken me too long..

more updates at some point, my near future is off to krakow tomorrow, and kiev a few day after that.  explanations shall follow, probably from bishkek.

love to all xxx"

but now i want to email people and just say hey, but theres too much i cant explain so really theres no piont writing at all.  aarg. 

so instead i shall share some lyrics from my current favourite song, the first ive ever like with such word...

you can't will yourself happy
you can't will your cunt wet
you can't keep standing at the station, pretening you're being met
can't wear a sign that says your's, when thats not what you get 

hmm

that summarrises nothing of my last three months but oh well

"event","i did it... after oh so much deliberation and talk, i finally resigned today.  well, handed in my notice, i still have to do a week or so working. but after six weeks, the end is nigh - i feel so freeeeee!!!

travel plans coming on slowly, the wedding is now being delayed to the 20th august to accomadate my sister working with palestinian refugees and there being no direct flights from lebanon to kyrgyzstan.  and my parents have just about accepted that i'll be travelling solo for five weeks, visas permitting.  my mum actually told me i shoulnd't plan where to go as i might meet people and find interesting things to do... exactly as i wanted but thought they'd need to have an itinery from me. so woo! too bad i'm going to have a three weeks less of wages to play with... oh well.  
 
other news.  last night i started randomly snipping my hair.  there was just a wee bit that needed cut, then another, and another, and then i had to do the other side... so today it went all very odd curls and bits that wouldn't stay tied up flying around the place in the wind up calton hill.  i think georgina had quite a bit more skill and artistic vision when she cut my hair like this initially.   

tomorrows the big launch, very exciting but i'm a bit scared that my 'refugee survival trust' badge will make the press expect me to know things. and what am i going to wear!!!  i suppose i'm going to be on show as the chairmans daughter as well as a volunteer. oh yeah, it'll be the first time i'll see my dad in proper work mode, giving a speech and everything. hehe.

so i suppose i better go get some sleep. 

goodnight"

<P>&nbsp;eigg - there for easter, very beautiful, i had flu but still managed a hike up a big hill and along a ridge with stunning views of the mountains of muck. started with chocolate again easter sunday, for some reason wasn't as momentus as usual. one day of glorious sunshine, many days of lovely people.</P>
<P>&nbsp;this week has been</P>
<P>&nbsp;working, annaing, forest pubbing, sleeping shopping, anna concerting, pubbing, bryony and dvding, sleeping pancaking, beltane practicing, beltane stoned-becoming, sleeping working, too lazy to climb jo's strairsing, sleeping working, beltane organisers meetinging, sleeping working, beltane glowing, bryony and henrying, sleeping volunteering, beltane shopping, beltane fish-making, jee and tessa phoning and about to be sleeping </P>
<P>and my next week? </P>
<P>volunteering, working, beltane peopleing, sleeping beltane shopping, working, sarahing, sleeping sleeping, travel planning, beltane practicing, sleeping volunteer project launching, oetkb civic receptioning, sarahing, sleeping day tripping, beltane practicing, sleeping working, beltane cloak-making, sleeping working, beltane fish-making, sleeping </P>
<P>can you tell that some thing are taking over my life? i'm basically living beltane cept sleeping and working, and the occassional seeing of a friend. of course i missed out eating, i thought if i included it every time it was done it would take away from the point of the entry - eg beltane is clearly creeping up on my time schedule dramatically. </P>
<P>time is an odd thing. on the 3rd of may i am leaving the country, hopefully not back for four months(yeah i really need to plan some more of that - i have 5 weeks in europe with no idea where i wanna be or what i wanna do). when i get back it is just about time for me to start uni. i'll only be living at home for another three weeks. weird. even though its hardly like i live here at the moment, to actually have a place where i live full-time will be weird. i'm kinda settling into my life at the moment, but considering how unsettled that life is its a bit mixed up. anyway. </P>
<P>sleepy now. </P>"

"event","so i feel like i haven't updated in a while.  happy new year everybody!

the first month of this beautiful year have proved pretty well for me i think.  lots of silly flirty fun, which i should maybe calm down soon.  and the beginnings of a couple new hobbies -  i started contact improvisation dance classes, which i maintain is more than rolling around on the floor with strangers.  and a few days ago i bought a fire-staff, after falling in love with playing with fire at bilston last week.

new year, new beginnings, new people - forest is once again spreading ground for new lovely folk. as well as the golden oldies who remain as fabulous as ever. 

some things don't change, some feelings never go away,  either comforting or scary, i can't decide.  time moves on, people grow, expand, but they don't change.  they just go on to the next stage of their path. but burying your head in other things always helps, helps to hide yourself from yourself.  sometimes you can loose yourself and forget the parts of your life you wish were different, even when you know that the thoughts are floating down there somewhere, you're just trying to ignore things that would seem fucked up if you thought about it.

and sometimes amy writes a load of bullshit that she doesn't understand at the time but which will at some point click."

"event","matthew came home from kyrgyzstan yesterday... amidst the trying to download russian pop onto the computer and incredible jetlag, he's been trying to explain his girlfriends religion to me and mum and dad. so far all i've got from it is that they beleive in a prophet who was driven around edinburgh in an automobile in 1913. this shall be interesting if they do get married soemtime next year, as is being discussed.  i don't know what i think about having a brother settled somewhere so far away, it's way too expensive for regular visits. but he's very happy there and i suppose that's all thats important. 

it's so good to see robin all the time.  like friday night - the evening he organised for the che went so well.  poems, face-painting, political sing-a-long songs, faery-tales (some sang too...), red wine, music, games.  when lots of people had left there was a beautiful impromptu jam - didgerido, thumb piano, guitar, drums, voices, dancing. then mr tim thumb piano man walked me to forest. more dancing, more drinking and covering many many people in blue spirals from my face.  
 
work the next day included a chat about me being more than an hour late twice in one week... oopsey. but it's all cool. work night out that evening, not the most insane dinner possible but our end of the table were getting close to it.  oh and i was in a skirt, shockhorror - incredibly odd for me. then off to forest for a real fabulous night.  the very were very good, utterly manic dancing as i love it. had to take my tights off as was so hot, tessa ended up leaving with them... i'm actually finding it pretty hard to work out what i did for six hours. i know it included smoking a lot of pot (well to me it was a lot).  oh and lots of smoking of the hookah too, i've never enjoyed smoking something so much... it's so smooth and tastes so good. oh and i randomly bumped into callum again it was funny. well, it was in my state. between about five and six me and nat kept switching from almost falling asleep on the mattress's and getting up to dance for all the good songs, while sarah and darren were curled up and asleep hands and feet tangled....awww!  taxi back to sarahs with them and a few hours sleep before waking up for work still stoned.

the night before i'd planned to stay at bryony so my shoes, trousers, toothbrush and mobile were all there.  eek.  at sarahs house i have a pair of burgundy velvour trousers i wear for pjamas... so i wore them (i could not wear the skirt back to work the morning after..) and no shoes - the sandals were unwalkable in.  so i went for the bus like this and got on the bus holding a five pound note - 'sorry i absolutly have no change' and thankfully the bus driver was lovely and just waved me on.  so i got off on princes street and wandered into work stoned, shoeless and wearing pjamas.  

thankfully it was only a four hour shift so i survived.  that evening was the roller-disco and 'do' at forest so i was back to use of lots of energy skating around... more hookah smoking then utterly collapsing on a sofa downstairs to listen to music and poetry. a funny beginning of a conversation - 'hi ant, i'm amy... you don't know me... i've slept in your bed'

before this manic weekend was also good. tuesday went to cat's to find out all about working in australia, ended up staying over. then after work the next night saw people including robin and michelle at forest where i helped wrap mushrooms in tinfoil to hang from the ceiling - they made good decorations actually. stayed at sarahs then the next night TESSA CAME HOME. lots of us met up at forest and just lounged around on the matress with lots of good banter and catching-up-ness.  speaking of tessa, apart from that night and a lovely trip to hendersons with her and monika on my lunch break, i really haven't seen enough of her yet... but i do have over month and everyone needs their turn."

"event","today i went for a 2 1/2 hour solitary walk.  i planned to go to craigencalt and see adam and his new treehouse... well i found the beginnings of the new treehouse but no adam, oh well.  its in a really nice location, kinda off a slope so there's actually steps up to it instead of a scary ladder.  it's higher than the last one, so even more stunning views - you can see right across the barns and loch, right across the farm.  and it's further away from the waterfall so no constant running water making you need to pee when trying to sleep. thats something i remember from about six years ago, lying across in a hammock above about four people sleeping on top of the trapdoor so no way i could go down to the loo...
i went for a wander round the fields and down through the faerie woods.  their tiny carved castle is still there, but many of the faery sculptures have deteriorated in their two years of watching over the trees.  i saw three swans in beautiful formation, standing in line along the shore then one by one gliding onto the water.  
i sat for a while on a side of the loch i don't usually go, contemplating life from a different angle. 45 degrees can make things look very different.
instead of going home for some late lunch which would be the logical next step, i decided to continue my walk down to the deserted beach.  the tide wasn't very far out so as i sat on the rocks waiting for the beginnings of sunset i could hear the waves lapping up below me, see the foam climbing closer and closer towards me.  the sky was still in its subtle wisps of yellow peeking through the puffs of cloud, nothing like the vibrancy of last nights pink and orange. i turned my back on the start of the end of the day, back into the blue of the east and my ever later than planned lunch."

"event","i know i should really be telling all about the fantabuloussness of wales and seeeing tessa and stuff... and it really was incredible. but thats a long story post which amy cant be arsed with at the moment.  although i am excrutiatingly happy with my life at the moment, i still have annoying pangs of pathetic-ness. i cannot become friends with someone i am attracted to.  it is just very silly and makes me feel like shit. aaarg. was very hyper at forest earlier it was quite fun, randomly running down to chamber street on my own in no shoes, stopping and walking back. then henry and ami made me do difficult things like hop while holding my nose and spinning round.  
i dyed my hair last night. i was in cardiff yesterday and was going to get another shade of browny red, but the name of the red i liked was 'cyber' and the dark brown was 'bitter-sweet chocolate'. so of couse, being me, i had to go for the one with chocolate in the title.  and it turned out incredibly dark, almost black, definetly the darkest ive ever been. i keep getting a really big shock when i see my reflection.   
amy is blabbering. 
iron and wine 'such great heights' has just come on. has to be the sweetest song ever, one of those that you can like so much it hurts. which is ridiculous.   
things i have been called recently: 
            aggressive (sarahs arty friends)
            sweet (twice in one msn conversation, by someone who really doesnt call me sweet)
            cute (in an email, just for writing in spanish)
            like a dog (by two different people seperatly at forest tonight)
so im really not sure what this means about me. 
for the first time in ages i felt constrained by my parents tonight. i suppose im testing them. i just crave independance. i do not need to be picked up from the train station after getting the last train home.  i think they want me to still need them as much as i did.  why, in some ways of course i do, but in other ways i just need to be given the chance to test myself. i cant actually work out what this is referring to but i know theres something there. 'cant grow up dont think i even wanna try'."

today has been rather an exceptionally long day. volunteering at the RST this morning so had to get up just after seven, with only about 5 hours sleep due to my silly sleeping pattern, then working all afternoon - sarah and roween came to say hi :) 
and then randomly off to innocent emmas this evening to catch up.  and now im home... 

a couple of odd fundraisers im probably doing... 28th november walking across hot coals with body shop people for 'children on the edge'

 then a team of us should be parachuting from many thousand feet for the Refugee Survival Trust early next spring.... if anyones wants to join this one then they are welcome if they can raise the minumum sponsoship... speaking of the sponsorship.... erm, sorry but you will probably be asked in time. 

so um i think thats all of interest in my life at the moment. after work tomorrow i should be going to hanas... hopefully to get utterly pissed, i feel like i havent been properly drunk in too long. you will be informed my online friend. goodbye for now dear journal."

last night was cool, a meal with some friends of my brother and him, really funny mature(ish) chat with lots of lovely people, red wine and good food, then back to ploughshare for lots of hours talking to robin, im so glad that i can call my big brother a good friend aswell.  

on saturday i went back to work all happy and smiley.  my boss was a litle patronising - 'oh amy you were like a different person today, every time i looked over you were chatting away to customers and smiling'. yay. still haven't decided if i'll quit yet.  i need to make use of my 50% discount first.

saturday night was sarahs 18th birthday party thing.  despite the slight gender imbalance, it was a really cool night.  how i do love pretentious art students who aren't really pretentious just incredibly charming.  hana was rather funny in her drunken-ness, and little amy and i managed to greatly confuse a guy on the phone with the whole two amy's thing.  id taken some mushrooms but had never tripped with so many people around so freaked out a little and went off for a walk myself, only to bump into racheal and a couple others, so walked them so the bottom of leith walk where i presently ran into an incredibly pissed anna and bryony who proceeded to stumble back to sarahs with me, singing at the top of their voices through the residential streets in the middle of the night... but i did get to smash a bottle which was very fun...
in the morning it was like old times, i made my drop-scones for nat, anna, bryony, claire, nicole and hana (sarah doesnt like them).  then everyone else left and i used the rest of the batter to make a champagne and chocololate cake... four inches deep in a frying pan.  i have to say it didn't really work.  but did taste yummy of course. i felt like a bit of a pig that weekend... did i mention that sarah saved a whole pizza for me? and that i managed to polish off a whole vienetta to myself? mmmmm food...

ive just realised i havent yet mentioned the big blether.  it was an incredibly fantastic weekend, starting with the classy picnic me and bryony managed on the train... mm food.  it was already dark when we arrived so we ate some free leftovers, got help setting up the tent from gandalf and took an early night... or so we thought.  neither of us could sleep and so when we got a text from sam to say he'd just arrived we wandered back to the big barn in our pjamas to see him and the rest of the glasgow contingent... i arranged to meet phil for an early morning explore but of course when my  alarm went off i thought fuck it and turned it off, making me and bryony late for the first workshops. oh well... we did go to lots of workshops that day, including camcorder guerillas and (for me) scots law for activists and nuke-spotting.  then, after a 'wee smoke' in simons car (including a random call from sams drunken friend claire) it was the celiedh yaaaay. hehe.  there followed lots of manic danicing, falling over in the sand, acrobatics and my second night in a row of beer, whiskey and pot. and chocolate. mm... oh and heather said she'd be willing to try teaching me russian, yay! then back off to the tent, this time with sam too, where proceeded a few hours of us all talking... actually sorry, a few hours of me talking and the others falling asleep... whoops.. i was a little hyper... anyway.  the next morning was yoga with my brother and some others in a teepee in a field with cows - perfect way to start the day. and later, love sex and radical politics... umm i kinda fell asleep... nothing to do with the  workshop, it was just so cosy and i was so shattered from my hyperness...  then that afternoon i got to go on a horse which was very cool.  then the train home and more food provided by mark and heather, and the remainder of bryony and my oatcakes... mmm food...  then staying at bryony's and back to work on monday..."

"event","aaaarg okay today has been a rather shitty day.  i had to go to my brothers today as i relaised id picked up the wrong toothpaste, so i went back to exchange it, to find mines wasnt there.  anyway this wasn't a big deal but got me thinking on the way to work of all the things id lost recently - my wallet, young persons railcard, watch, railcard receipt, train timetable, bra... and then i was thinking, well screw it its not such a big deal, its just stuff and can be replaced.  but then i got all thinking about sentimental shit, like how id got my wallet in scarborough on my last ever visit to see my grandma, and how my mum had bought that watch for me specially in germany,  and about how my railcard had that photo that id got when tessa was with me. and then i got onto the realy big issue of missing tessa so bad, and started crying cos i was all hormonal too. so i was sitting in the gardens for about 40 minutes sobbing, at one point starting to call tessa then realing that i really shouldn't cos shes off with her whole exciting new life and i really dont wanna bring her down.  so then i really had to get to work and arrived all blotchy-red in one of those moods when anyone asking how you are will just start the waterworks again. so of course that happened straight away as i looked an utter state, and my manager called my into his office for a 'chat'.  basically this was a half hour of him telling me im fucked up and hes worried for a while about me as he never seems to see me happy, and that he thinks i have some underlying problems that are affecting my work.  and then theres all the shit about how i should think about whether being there is good for me as working on princes street in such a busy shop might be too much pressure for me. FUCK HIM.  then there was the shit about him having all these cvs of people who would be a lot more confident on the shop floor and more comfortable talking to customers.  so basically... he wants me to quit so that he doesnt have to fire me for being depressed. 
really, fuck him.  after two weeks he really doesnt know me.  yes hes caught me in a bad spell, i know ive been in my uggness for a while, but really!  he actually said that if i can be back to the 'happy, bubbly person they employed' by saturday then they could just forget that today ever happened.  as if i can  control my moods! i cant just make myself hyper.  it comes and goes.  if theres anything i know about myself is that i cant decide when im coming out of my uggy spells.  people at school got used to it.  they could tell when i was down and knew when to just leave me alone. me and emma even had a word for it - shoogle - for when she could tell i was feeling shitty and i just couldnt explain it. so shoogle basically meant, yes i love you but im not going to be able to show it for a while.  even my drama teacher knew when i was uggy, she had to give me a couple of councelling sessions.  she once called it a 'crisis in confidence' but can they really be every few months for at least a few weeks at a time?  anyway, whatever it is i get unhappy times and i know i can be bloody annoying in them.  i generally hide from the world but its proving a bit difficult now.  so im just pissing everyone off instead.   fuck why cant i just be normal me.  it is so fucking impossible to pretend im not feeling like this.  thats the thing, whenever i feel anything it is so bloody obvious.  this evening when i went to see emma, jee and annas drama shows at school so many fucking people told me i looked shattered.  but it was really nice to see them all. and get big hugs from chris which is always lovely.  okay anyway.  thats enough. one day ill write a happy post."

"event","well i'm rather shitty at this updating thing aren't i?  i seem to have a lot to tell since last time... rounding off in another outburst of 'men are scum' but we'll come to that later.
the last month or so have produced many 'interesting' memories... firstly i suppose was the happening at forest.  but shit i don't remember much of that... there was a good beatles sing-a-long on the pavement at the beginning of the night and twister at some point in the morning, with me and bryony leaving at about 11am.  i managed to miss the paint fight, for some reason instead being sick in someones toilet - but i have to say it was rather amusing to come back to forest and see all the paint-speckled drunken bodies.  then was a rather hungover leaving party for tessa, where for one of the first times in my life i refused a glass of red wine. that night i was on an overnight coach to london for the notting hill carnival the next day with my sisters - it was so cool, thousands of people dancing on the streets.  and way too many pervy men.. bleugh.  
so there follows a couple more days in london and then back to fife and a free house for two week... out of this the memorable times included a beautiful posh dinner with tessa in my conservatory - complete with candles, red wine and food from the freezer, then cocktails and dressing up to watch SATC.  i also had a very interesting 'trip' with nat and andrew, and sarah there to feed me grapes...  
that was an utterly fantabulous night, i never knew my house could be so mystical, mushrooms are great vegetables.  but a word of warning - they should not be eaten the night after you get your nipple pierced - the novelty is just too great and can lead to severe pain... or am i the only one that stupid? 
then follows the joy of jobsearching in edinburgh and eight days continuosly with sarah, it got to the point that she became a drug to me, just seeing her could make me laugh hysterically. in a good way of course.  in that time we made the most incredible card for tessa and gave it to her on 'pink and purple day' at forest, which was cool but getting more emotional as tessa really was leaving soon.  we had to finally say bye to her on the night before she left, which was utter hell.  but then resulted in the most amusing walk back to leith with sarah which included the phrases 'whack her like a pinata, see if all the sweets fall out' from a scary man with an umbrella, and 'please remove yourself from the pavement' from sarah after she'd made me laugh so bad i couldn't stand up.  there was also random letter writing but no burglary!    
the last couple of nights of my free house i couldn't even stand being in my house as i'd seen a mouse, and anyone who knows me knows how patheticly scared i am of them.  so i went back to edinburgh and stayed in my brothers room as he was away, spending the time with his ex-girlfriend, who turned up both nights i was staying there late and drunk... 
my parents came home that friday so i spent a courteous one night at home before back to edinburgh to work at forest till two and then a very drunken and topless party at ryans - or was that just me and bryony?  details of that night probably shouldn't be shared, but lets all laugh at bryony...
the next afternoon, before sleeping, was a trip to dundee with andrew to see his uni life... there followed a beer-filled couple of groovy student days, but remind me never to go to another economics lecture as long as i live..
back to edinburgh to catch up with sarah and search for more arty inspiration ... i took her to ploughshare to meet robin and draw some hippy house-ness, and stayed for tea and the  night before my first day working at the body shop which was alright, then sarahs for a night.  volunteered in the morning at the RST, a trip round the scottish parliament in the afternoon thanks to bryony's security pass, then out to bilston with her and sarah for a few hours... had an impromtu treehouse-warming party in chris's treehouse with a few people and some whisky, vodka and pot... then a big thoughtful chat in the bus stop where we realised that men really are scum, and so on the bus back to edinburgh bryony and i wrote and signed the following document:

'Amy and Bryony are going to spend the month from 24th of September to the 24th of October without:
- flirting
- kissing 
- sexual behavior/acts
- obsessing over other persons
This is for our own wellbeing of mind and body and we have both chosen to do this, without outside influence.
signed - amy naumann, bryony mcleod
witnessed by - sarah
dated - 24/09/04'

we then went off to gary and jools's alice in wonderland 'tea party'... had some more vodka and mushroom tea, but then realised we were both too down to bother with group conversation, so we wandered down to annas house as she was away and had given bryony her keys.  just as we got to her door i started tripping and so followed a fantastic couple of hours, even with the down-ness.  i watched crazy/beautiful and sobbed so bad for reasons i can't really remember now... partly the film, partly the drugs and partly the feelings that the earlier conversation had brought up.  after the tears had dried and i felt human again, i went and joined bryony in bed and slept until way too late as i was working the next day and ended up being late as i had to get from anna's to bryony's to princes street in less than an hour.  woopsey.  after a thoroughly knackering 6 1/2 hours on my feet, i popped back to bryony's to change and found she hadn't been home yet. i met my parents and robin at the filmhouse to see the 'motorcycle diaries', which was so very good i have to recomend it to everyone.  and then home last night and that leads me to now, waiting for sarah to come over.  the end."

"event","i forgot to mention this last night and anna was very shocked... yes i think men are scum.  well not all and not always but they tend to have the great potential for it, and it is kinda a catchphrase of mine when i'm drunk and upset. when i was saying this to neil last week he changed it aorund quite sweetly - 

Men are:
           Smart   
           Caring   
           Unfeeling    
           Mad about you 

well the unfeeling part is right anyway."

"event","hello, i'm at anna's house at her 'fuck the neighbours' bbq/party. and currently being told off by tessa for picking at my scabs... a little advice everyone... drunk and pissed off walking around on your own can lead to very bad scrapes.  random drunken self-destruction-ness is not good.  anyway.  my sister is coming home from morocco tonight - how come my brothers and sisters have so much more interesting lives then me?  it's so not fair. one day i shall travel.  well once i've got myself a job and a little money... i've left school for almost three months now and not that much to show for it.  something will come out of the year-out other than a hell of a lot of drunken memories/regrets...
i went to faslane on monday which was really cool.  it was a blockade of the nuclear base there, with lots of people locking on and getting arrested.  i want to do that next year but i decided not to this time as an upcoming courtcase could jeopordise my plans for this year.  so instead i kinda got topless with bryony and nat... to distract the police.  now im just hoping that topless photos won't turn up on some website or cnd newsletter...
right i better be off now so find more alcohol before i start really spraffing.  you will hear from me again.  goodnight."

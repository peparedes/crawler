"event","Jeez. Today has been okay, I guess. Nothing really notable, except for the fact I'm almost through with this girl situation. A resolution is coming fast, and I'm very relieved. This just teaches me to not get attached before I really..really know them. And it really is my fault for this. But I am not drinking as much as I did over the weekend. Thats for sure. I was drinking Melo Yello this morning, and damn. I still tasted Vodka. I guess I really did try to drown my sorrows. I think I was choking though, personally.

Other than that, I visited my grandmother, and I took a nap there..and I went home. Thats it for today. OH OH OH OH OH YEAH. Amber + boyfriend = broke up. Now its Amber/Boyfriend + X(2 guys)=new boyfriend. So, thats where we're at."

I just wanna cry like a stupid bitch again. Just let it all out and so I can just go on with my life. I don't wanna bottle anything up anymore. I wanna get it out and go on. god dammit I'm semi-crying right now. I just want this over with. 

I tried calling amber. She promised to call me on break, which she didn't. I guess she hates me too. I've got nothing left. Why can't I move on? I want to move on so bad. I just wish I had someone to hold me sometimes. I don't like admitting it and I would never admit it. I just feel numb at the moment. I don't know what else to say besides, I want to move on. I just wish I would fucking cry and get it over with. I'm trying to hold back tears I should have shed years ago, but I guess I'm not drunk enough to do it. I want to just end it, but I have work tomorrow.  I can't come in with a hangover. Well, the tears finally hit my cheek, and I think I'm ready to cry my eyes out in bed. Have a good night."

"event","About 12:30, I started drinking last night. I didn't stop until half the bottle of vodka was gone. I was so drunk. I kept talking and talking..and I told a bunch of stuff that I'd normally keep bottled in. I was an honest person too. About after two hours of this, though, I started tearing up, and from what I remember typing in a certian mIRC channel..

( @Moonlight^Knight ) but I still feel lousy
( @Moonlight^Knight ) I'm crying
( @Moonlight^Knight ) like a stupid bitchf
****************************************************
Yeah. That sums up last night. I know why I teared up and cried and stuff. I remember laying in bed, talking to myself, ""She should like me. I'm a nice guy. I never do anything bad to anyone. I really try to be a good guy."" I kept talking to myself until I passed out. So..thats pretty much it."

"event","Jeez. Work was okay today, but it was great about 1.

A worried grandmother came in, and her small grandchild would not get out from the playland. He was crying and stuff. Well, I decided to go up there in the playland and get him. I heard him crying as soon as I got to the top of the tunnel. I went to him, and said, ""We're gonna see mammaw, okay?"" He was no older than 2 or 3, he nodded, ""okay"".

He just wanted me to hold him. He wouldn't let go of my collar. Ack. Well, finally after holding him and crawling to the slide, I told him, ""We're gonna have fun, okay?"" He said, ""Okay!"" We slid town the slide, I even said, ""Weeeeee"" with him. The woman thanked me for getting her grand child, and as soon as I walked in, I was complicated by customers, ""You're so nice, young man. You're great."" It definitely boosted my day. I was a hero to someone. That makes me feel good. Kind of made me think how my criminal justice career could possibly turn out. Helping people out. That felt great.

As the day progressed though, I thought about my situation last night with the girl. So, I convinced my manager (haha) to buy me a bottle of vodka. I am so getting fucked up tonight. I dun care. I am getting fked up. I will hit the bottle.

Anyway, dealing with the girl. Chris's dad told me, ""Hey! Why are you complaining? This is friends with benefits here. You can get whatever you want from her. Its great!"" In my mind though, <i> Could I really do that with someone like its supposed to be casual? Hm...</i>

So now that ponders in my mind. As I poison my mind tonight, I'll probably tear up or something, but damn. I need this. I need this night to get drunk. Nothing like a sad man on vodka.

Thats it for me today."

"event","Well. Things are definitely interesting, to say the least. I really need and will cut connections off with that girl. I just can't believe it. Her mother, family even want me to go for it. But I know a side of her which no one else knows unless I tell.

I went to where she worked, and I was going to drop off a note, which kind of described what feelings I had for her. Well, it was all fine and dandy, until I turn around and notice someone else who is ALSO waiting on her. No big deal, right? Everyone needs friends. Hah. Just wait until I explain it. Well, her father comes and picks her up, me and the guy decide to follow her to a fast food joint for some food. Well, that was fine and dandy. I asked her father if I could take her out, which he said was fine SINCE I'm good with the family. But as for my sixth sense of people, something didn't smell right.

Something reeked of hidden feelings and emotions that were never said. I decided to break this. I had to take the guy back to his truck somewhere else. I finally asked him, ""So, you're friends with her, but you like her, don't you?"" Something just told me so. And I was right, he does like her. And I asked him what he's done with her. And yet again, I was right. They've probably done more than I have with this girl. Right then, I knew. I knew this was bullshit and I don't need it.  I'm already some kind of emotional trainwreck, and I just wanted someone to love, hold, and cherish. Yeah, I want a long term. Because A mature relationship is what I want. And after finding all this out...

I can't deal with that. I have to cut all connections. I HAVE TO. Deep inside, I know there was possible feelings for this girl. I feel bad for her current situation and family problems, but if this is how its going to be, then I'm done with it. I'm sure there's someone out there, but I won't fight like a damn dog for something in vein. I REFUSE TO. I've wasted over two weeks of my time on this girl. Thinking about her, remembering how she tasted..the fragrance of her hair. Everything. And now after this, I feel empty on the inside. And now again, I think to myself, <i>How could someone play a game with someone's feelings like this? Its inhuman. ITS CRUEL.</i> But again, who said the world wasn't cruel.

So, here I am. Empty on the inside. Heartless feeling, almost. And...I just don't know the outcome. I don't know how its going to work out. I hope I have some divine intervention or something."

"event","After recent events, I've came to a simple conclusion. Who am I?

Part of me wants to return to the Dark Knight phase I went through. Grow my hair back long, shave the stashe, and start wearing my black coat again and be in my world.

Another part of me..likes the way I am. Stashe, spiked hair, and that kind of stuff.

I'm really torn in between. I feel like I should return to the roots of who I really was/am, but yet..I don't know. Its quite complicated. I have yet to figure out this predicament. I wouldn't know how to merge the two together. 

Part of me wants to be that dark, cold feeling self. The other side, wants to be loved, love someone and just live a light happily ever after.

So..how would I merge? I don't know."

I wasn't hurt at all, (Okay, maybe a lot of hurt) but I'm happy its over with. She said that she wanted to be ""Friends with benefits"" though. You know what, I actually don't care. Sure, why not. I can't be anymore souless than what I am now. 

I wish my mother would butt out of this situation. Shes like, ""YOU BETTER GET THAT RING BACK AND..."" sheesh.I just don't care anymore. if I get shot or something today, it just wouldn't matter. And its going to be like that."

"event","As for finding love, I guess its true. But, after several personal experiences with this girl, if indeed it does not work out, I don't plan on doing anything with anyone else. Sounds stupid, I know, but its my only resolution. Here's the incredibly stupid part.

<ljcut>
I still remember like..everything about her. I can't imagine duplicating these situations with some other girl. Like..when we were holding each other, she'd purr into my ear. I couldn't purr, so I just blew a raspberry on her cheek, and she  giggled so much. When I remember back about all this, I get a chill. I think to myself, <i> How can someone do these things if they're not attracted to each other? It just seems like too much of a sin if they're not. </i>

</ljcut>

So I don't know. But if it does not work out. I'll do as everyone recommends. I'll quit looking. And its a fair deal, actually."

"event","Yeah, I don't think I've grown up or matured as much as I thought in two years. Especially when it comes to emotions. I met someone a few months ago, and we finally went out the other day. It was great. It was like the rest of the world didn't matter to me. I liked it. At near end of the date, we were cuddling, nuzzling noses, stuff like that. I never wanted it to end. I never, wanted it to end. I really, never, wanted it to end. But something deep down inside of me says, ""This won't work out."" I hate that voice. I want this to work out. She is dating someone else, but I don't think he treats her as good as I did on just one time I've went out with her.

I guess I'm just a horrible person. But...

I. Never wanted it to end. Never. Can I go back? I really want to go back. I really want to feel loved. In a way, I wish the Grand Am accident I had did finish me off."

I'm not going to bitch and complain; no one wants to hear that, and I'm not going to. I'll find a way to get over this, but for now, I'm vulnerable.

"event","Lets start from Saturday.

SATURDAY:
I woke up about 9:30 AM, well, my father woke me up. We had to cut down a dead tree in front of my grandmother's apartment. We go over there, and she fed us a great breakfast of eggs, toast, bacon, and orange juice. After that, we cut down the tree. We had a little trouble starting the chainsaw, but then we got it going. Well, after that..I came home, and waited on Usagi. ""<3"" But it seemed I got a phone call from a girl named Stephanie. She's a nice girl, of course. She invited me to go to church with her. Of course, being me, I wasn't sure if I should go or not. But being respectful, I decide to go.

SUNDAY:
Well, I get up, and get dressed. About 9:30 AM, Stephanie comes and picks me up. We go to the church. The nice part was, I knew a lot of people there. It was really nice. My third and fourth grade teacher was there, along with my Contemporary Issues teacher. There was also about four people from my school I knew. I always got along with all of them, so it was a good time in church. Even the preacher was someone I knew from my school. I liked his way of bringing the lesson. He gave people interaction, which kept me awake longer, to say the least.

After church, Stephanie takes me out to eat at the Baileyton Resturant, (Nice little country resturant) and the food was really good. Stephanie and I talked for a good while. Going against my traditional side though, she paid for the food. I can imagine Usagi laughing at me now =D. Well, she dropped me off, and I went home, and to bed. About two hours later, Stephanie calls, and wakes me up. I never get to sleep because someone ALWAYS calls. Not that its bad, but I'd like to get some sleep once in a while. She tells me how she got back from Greeneville, and she was thinking about me. I was sort of , ""Eh?"" But then she drops the bomb. I hate it when my life becomes some drama episode. She tells me she likes me, and wants to date me. I didn't want to date her, so I just told her..in a polite way. Usually I'm like, ""No. I don't think we should date"" But I let her off easy. She seemed to understand, and thank goodness she did. 

Usagi was on, and I talked to her for a few minutes. She was feeling iffy, so I decided that we would both sleep, and wake up together about 9 PM. Which is..now. Looks like she overslept. Cute ""<3"""

"event","Indeed, I have. I compared myself with my past self..and I can clearly tell that I have changed. Lets make a small list of changes.
<lj-cut text=""Comparison"">
Old self: (Good)
Out going
Happy
Respectful
Honest (Theres a negative to this)
Social person
================
Old self:(Bad)
Depressed
Dependant
Always looking for a girlfriend
Vulnerable
Didn't have priorities straight
Honest, but put it in a wussy way
Didn't stand up for self

================
Now, as for my ""new self"" I find this to be the way I've always wanted, and I will never change.

New Self:(Good)
Withdrawn
Honest, being straight to the point, holding no words back
Anti-social
Independant
Independant attitude
Stands up for self
====================
New Self: (Bad)
Cold (To most people)
Always serious (Can be taken good or bad)
Being classified as ""mean"" (I've been called this a lot recently.)
====================
</lj-cut>
Thats about it. Now, to explain my day.

Brittni the incredible unedible whore decides to pick up interest in the trial of the murderers who killed Billie Jo. Last year, she didn't care about what happened, and she told her boyfriend that he would NOT go. What a bitch, huh? Well, now she's like, ""I'm gonna cut out the articles."" Cut yourself instead, bitch. I really don't like her.

Today at the center for technology (Where my criminal justice class is) Today was our ""Social"" (Pizza, drinks, and other foods followed by awards) took place. The social in my terms was grab the food you want, sit down, eat, and don't talk to anyone. And thats just what I did. I don't care about many people in that class. And thats why I'll stay to myself. Awards took place, and I was hoping I would get the ""Outstanding Student"" award. I didn't, some other girl got it. What a flaming homosexual situation. I got the ""Most Progress"" award, which in my opinion, is second place, which is first loser. I guess I should be a bit more happier, taking it that there were only two awards given out.

I came home, took a shower, and that about wraps it up. By the way, Nephiritina, if you read this..I'm glad you're back. Its been a while since we've seen each other. Don't worry, I'll make sure to have some time for you, if I see you.

Ciao, people."

It seems that his trial was wrong, and the two women who accused him of his crime are whores, but thats just my opinion. Fast forwarding to riding home, Beverly (Some girl that rides with us) looks at me and says, ""You need to quit being mean."" I shook my head, ""I'm not mean, just honest."" Brittni, like the little whore she is, raises her hand, ""I second that."" You like sloppy second penises, whore. She complains about everything. She said she would quit her job if they didn't give her Saturday off for her son's birthday. (Told you she's a whore.)

Yeah, she's been comforted by her richy rich parents all her life, and she's cusses worse than a sailor. Whores come and go, but this one never learns to shut the fuck up.

"event","Oh..well. Since today is today..I should rewind to yesterday. To the bat cave.

Yesterday:

It was pretty much a bad day. 1st and 2nd period went by, but when I went to the vocational school,and everything was okay. I go to break, and the class that was leaving stands up, and this one guy looks at me, ""Hey! What are you lookin' at?!"" Of course, being me.. ""What am I supposed to be looking at?""  Of course, the guy loses his cool, his friends dragging him to class, ""Keep on running your mouth, and I'll kick your ass!"" As I seen him start to walk or being dragged away, I said, ""Yeah, yeah. Don't let your boots drag on the ground."" Haaahahaa. I know why that guy said that. For those of you who remember. Remember that guy who messed me up in Mock Trial? Yeah. He talked to those people, and they think they can whoop me. Let them try.

If people have read N4CAG's LJ, you would have already known that my Aunt died last Sunday. I went to her funeral..and she was where Billie Jo's funeral was held. It was like going into a nightmare. When I looked around, I didn't see reality..I seen what I saw when Billie Jo died. I seen her closed casket..the picture video showing her when she was a little girl..and when she was getting older. Everything around me just triggered something. I never said anything when I got in, and I had to stay for about an hour. I stayed mostly outside. Even the weather was the same when she died.

I got home, and changed clothing. I was talking in my usual channel, and Sosi asked me an odd question. This is how it went down in my own words.

(Sosi) Knight, when's your birthday?
(Knight) September 21st. (In my mind: ..Why is she asking that for? Putting it in her LJ or something?)
(Sosi) Well then, happy early birthday

And then..she shows a link. She bought me what I've been wanting for a long time. She buys me a FFVIII Griever necklace, bracelet, ring, and keychain. I don't know if the long day affected me or not, but all of a sudden, I burst into tears. This lasted for a good five minutes, until I went to the bathroom and splashed water on my face. It was so wonderful. I never expected anyone to do such a nice thing for me. 

Today:
I went to WSCC (Walters State Community College) where several speakers talked about certian things, and such. Even a band played. It was a nice day. If no one knows..I mine as well inform them. Brittni, the girl that has been taking me home, has been a stupid bitch lately.  Myself and others keep trying to warn her, but she won't listen. Well, fine. Don't bitch to me when you get what you deserved, you fucking whore.

Usagi is going through a rough time right now, and I'm going to go spend time with her. I know things happen and such, but Usagi is one person that I cannot leave for a long period of time. I know my attitude states otherwise, but Usagi has a special place in my heart, and I will not turn my back on her. She is a very special friend to me.

Thats all for today."

"event","I look back on the last time I've updated, and then I remember, ""..Wow. There's a lot we don't know about."" So, I'm gonna break it into months.

January:
This is where I get my fancy idea of thinking, ""..I'm tired of everyone having a better computer. I'm building my own!"" I'm glad I said that, because it was one of the best investments I've ever made. I get my new class schedule, and I finally get to take Criminal Justice. At first it was very different, but now, I like it. I'm always known as the quiet and cold person in the class. The teacher has a lot of respect for me, and I would assuem I'm his best student. My algebra class is horrible. It became harder, and not much fun! And..myself and Rose..what a joke! She was so immature, it wasn't even funny. If I'm going to date anyone, it will be a woman with class, and a pair of sexy legs. (Kidding on the last comment.)

February:
Love month, ugh. Lets put it this way. I celebrated this love month by wearing black on that celebrated day. Oh man, it was fun. Algebra got even harder, I was still saving up money for a computer. I was still working in concession stands to help save up for the computer.

March:
I sold my old computer, and got my money scraped all together, and bought my new computer. I was very happy about this. It was my first computer I built. So, it took me about 5 days to build, which was kind of horrible. But after that, I got everything to work, and I haven't had many problems after it. Yay me.

April:
..I don't remember anything. Man. That sucks. Oh well..one month closer to school ending.

May:
Okay, this is the month we're in, right? Oh..right, it is. Well..things have been going smoother in my classes except for Criminal Justice. It seems that a student has a problem with me, and I'd love for him to try something. Its not that I have gained a badass attitude, but I just know what and what not to stand up for (and who TO stand up against). Its something you gain over the years, I suppose. Other than that, I guess thats nothing else for me to rant about. Summed up five months in about...eh, half a page. Not too bad."

I know I tried to do a backflip, but I ended up landing on my shoulder, which hurts from time to time, right now. Chris came over, and we played Halo.

Problem: I was a depressed bitch for some reasons.

Well, none the less, I sucked in Halo. But, by the time Chris left, I had felt better, and had a new...outlook on life. I'm not going to explain it, since it's more of a rant than anything else, but it's still a new outlook. Hopefully this new outlook will keep me active, and not depressed like today. I was like, ""..Reason to live? Where?"" I just didn't see any point in me being here. Somehow, I just gave up thinking about it, and somehow came up with the new outlook.

It seems today was a total bitch. Infatuation sucks, by the way. Whoever created that should be stabbed slowly, and then baked slowly. That's my opinion."

I went to work, everything seemed right, but then..at different times, four customers yelled at me. It sucked, so bad. I didn't do anything wrong. There were so many people coming at the concession stands, it was horrible. I somehow managed through it, but it still sucked.

When I got home, I expected things to be better..but when I was getting a glass of milk, it spilled all over. I hated it!! I almost felt like crying. Everything was starting to get to me..

Usagi came on. I talked to her, and then she said, ""I don't like guys."" She named her reasons and such, but I said something I didn't mean. ""I assume girls are whores, but that's because from where I'm at, every teen is pregnant."" I shouldn't have said that. It was uncalled for. That made her mad, and I was rather crushed.

"event","Yesterday, was the finals on two of my classes. Algebra A, and English III. Algebra A final was easier than I thought. I had two smart people beside of me, and the teacher never paid attention, so I copied, and I'm pretty sure I passed. Mwahah. 2nd period, Heather (I always hang out with her. She's really pretty.) brought two boxes of small party mix, (pretzels, doritos, corn ships, etc.,) And she had it only for myself, Garrett, (Helped me meet Rose.) and of course, herself. Well, people asked for some of our Dr. Pepper, and our snack mix. Heather told'em no, because she's not made out of money, and it was just made for us.

I brought my laptop, so myself, Heather, and Garrett could play a game that they love so much, called Polar Bowler. We played until the end of second period, and that's when myself and Heather hugged each other. She whispered in my ear, ""I'm really going to miss being with you in this class."" My hand went across her back, which I replied, whispering, ""I know. But we'll still get to see each other, I promise."" And that was really the gist of it.

As for 3rd period. HALLELUJAH! I'm finally out of that whore house of a class. There were four pregnant people in the classroom, and they all thought they were bad bitches. Well, whatever, they're not bad unelss I say so, and they're nothing. We had to clean all the kitchens today, but I had to scrub the oven. I quit halfway through, because it was the last day, and it's not my job to scrub a mess I didn't do. So, screw that.

As for fourth period..it was average. I took the final exam, then went to sleep. That was it for the day, really. I went to the car, where Brittni was. (Friend who takes me home.) I got the front seat today, since Heather didn't ride. (Same one from my second period.) Myself and Brittni were talking, and I noticed how she was driving with one hand, and with a sly remark, I said, ""What are you gonna do with that other hand?"" Out of nowhere, she places her hand on my notebook, (Which was above my pants) and did a hand ejaculation movement. Sure the hell surprised me. 

Then, somehow, after that, we started taliing about sex, and the tricks..guys can do with their wangs. Brittni had the nerve to ask if I could ""jerk"" my wang without touching it, like some muscle thing.  ..I said I did. That was the worst of the discussion, thank god. But, then she wanted to know how it went up. ""Uh..it just does. It's just what women wear. Kind of physical attractiveness.""  Needless to say, after the conversation, I got home, and I..don't remember much of what happened yesterday. Wait..one more thing!

I remembered Usagi had to go away for a while, but she's back! Good thing for me, I was Role Play crazed. I still am, but that doesn't mean I'll get to Role Play. Oh well.

Today, I have to work concessions again from 5-10, so it shouldn't be so bad. Chris may be coming over tomorrow, but I'm not sure. We'll just have to see what happens."

"event","Today was okay, but it got worse as the day progressed. I seen Rose again, and I walked her to her 1st, 2nd, and 3rd period classes. From 12 to 1:30, we lounged in the stage, practicing. The same girl, Shaye, started to run her mouth, trying to act like she was in charge, and tried to get everyone to learn their lines. Bad idea. By the end of the student performance, Shaye forgot her line, and then said something to make Chris have the spotlight. She completely messed up the whole play. We skipped over 7 pages of dialogue, I believe.

I came home, and I had to find dad. He had a phone call. It pissed me off that he was sick, but yet he's now doing things. It makes me think that he purposly did that for his own reasons. Anyway, after getting him, I went to my room, and slept until I had to leave for the play. I sort of expected my parents to go and watch it, but they completely ignored it, and went to their christmas party.

I don't think I should have said anything about it. I told them when it was gonna happen, and they just ignored it. Why should I ask them go to the play? They should feel obligated to go, since I've put so much time into this. But, anyway..

Tonight's play went excellent. We only skipped 2 pages of dialogue this time, but we went along smoothly, vice versa today for the student performance. And that's all I have right now. I don't know what I'm going to do for tonight. I'll just watch tv or something."

"event","Today, overall, was really nice. Even though..I forgot to change shirts, and forgot my wallet. But,I seen Rose today. I'm walking her to all four of her classes..it's like we're..dating. I've actually thought about it, but I just don't know. I'm always iffy about things like that. Anyway, after school, we began to practice for the play we're doing TOMORROW, and people still don't know their lines. Poor them, mwah.

Then..of all people, Shaye Penely (She's someone who thinks she's all that, when her attitude makes her nothing.) brings her christmas CD, which in my opinion, was full of crap. I already made one for the play, and I had a good karaoke version of deck the halls. She completely ignores the fact that I'm stage manager, and it's my job to do that. I still go with my ""Fuck Society"" rule, but it's getting personal when people interfere with my job. I'll stab them with a spoon.

Anyway, I tried to do cues for the people, but someone was in my seat, and didn't bother to move. I was mad at that, then no one knew their lines. What the hell? This play is generally small, and we had about a month to practice? What have people been doing all this time? Wacking it? Seriously.

After practice, I helped out with concessions until 10:00. I started at four, making six hours of work. Not bad. I didn't find out until after the game that I'll get a check for helping out the concessions. Very nice. I'll be able to go in good this year with money. I love the concessions people anyway; their really nice people, and I'd help them out any time.

Now, my very very last rant for the night. Promise. My dad, I so friggin ""dislike his ways."" The play is tomorrow night, and he didn't even think of going to it. He'll go to the McDonalds christmas party, but not to the play. How nice is that? Then, I called my dad, saying I won't be in until 10, and he gives this big sigh of aggrivation. My step brother is at the house, wanting me to help him with a game. Well, fuck that. I had previous engagements, and I will not part the waters just for them. Here's my reason.

He's never helped me. My step brother has always had people help him. Like this one time, when I was little. My grandmother gave my step brother $10 to buy some snacks. I asked my grandmother for $1, and she said she didn't have it. How nice can you get? And another example; My step brother promised me a lot of things, but he never gave them to me. You know how pissed off that made me, thinking that I could trust him to be a big brother, but he proved to be a dope? Psh.

And now, I'm mad at my dad. He even expects me to help him. He gave me an attitude on the phone, and it's like he can't support me because he's worried about himself because he has the flu. Well, he's had it for over a week, and I've done everything. I've cut wood, stacked it to where we can keep warm. And what does he do? Continue to be sick, not even trying to help me. I hate it!

Whatever. I'll support myself."

"event","It's been one of those weeks. It's been focused on one thing: The Semi-Formal winter dance yesterday. I thought I'd never find a date, until I met Rose. Very nice girl, but she's a little bit shy. She's cute, too, but going on. I asked her to the dance, and she said yes. Very interesting. I didn't think I'd get a date. It was Junior/Seniors only, but Freshmen and Sophomore dates were allowed.

My friend Chris came over at about 6, and he was all dressed up, shirt tucked in, and all that stuff. Myself..I haven't shaved in two weeks, not showered in two days, I looked pretty rough. That changed with 30 minutes of bathroom time. I showered, shaved, brushed teeth, and then got on, what I'd like to call..the pimp gear. 

Long Black Army Coat
White dress shirt
Grey dress pants
Black shined boots (Mwah.)
Black/Grey/White tie.

I didn't tuck my shirt in, since it was just semi-formal. Chris was suprised to see much such clean and cut, since I did look like crap 30 minutes before. I didn't think Rose would show up, since her parents are REALLY strict over guys, dates, etc., but to my surprise, she came, and she looked nice. A red blouse, with a white dress. All the other girls wore..black dresses. It was really not cool, it was kind of like a goth parade, heh.

Anyway, Rose wouldn't dance the fast ones, so I got all the slow ones in with her. Heheh. As for you who know I like to dance, I did do one or two without her. Casper Slide, and the Electric Slide. Very easy dances, yet the people there didn't know how to do it. Reverse = 180, not doing the previous move. As for the electric slide, people couldn't do it right. They moved 6 steps instead of 4. Ignorance isn't bliss in dancing. One guy tried to show off various break dancing, but no one cared what he did, so that's one reason I didn't show him up.

One thing that amazed me is, the last dance, they played Broken, by Amy Lee and Seether. I have a habit of lip singing to the song, and I did that. Rose looked at me, and giggled slightly. I turned my head, and seen her dad. This guy is 6'4, and one of those people you wouldn't want to mess with. He seen myself and Rose dancing, and then he just waved at us, and went back to the lobby to wait on us. I expected him to drag her on out, but he didn't. Very awesome.

After the dance, I talked to the DJ, which I know very well. I told him to play ""Staying alive"", some old 70's song. At least I think it's 70s. Anyway, I asked my principal, ""Hey! Why don't you come in here and shake it!"" Haha, I thought I was going to get pulled out and get a talking to, but she was in a good mood, for once.

Myself and Chris helped afterwords clean up, and then we left. It was a nice night. Really nice. As for today...

God, I hate Sonic Adventure 2: Battle for one reason. The missions suck! Get this..do that, shove it up yours, pal. Other than that, it has been boring. Oh! one more thing.

Myself and Chris have been working at the shop to get some money for christmas. I was suppose to get paid this week, and I have not seen any money. So, myself and Chris decided to not work until we get paid. I'm tired of being lied to. And I won't stand for it."

I've really got no one to hang out with, which is almost going perfect with my ""Fuck Society"" thing I'm going with.

I'm losing weight pretty fast. And if I keep it up, I'll be buff in no time. That's something to be happy about. I have hardly any encouragement, so once again, I'm on my own. I guess I'm getting the hint early. Don't rely on encouragement..rely on yourself. I guess it's the best advice I could give myself.

I wish I would get paid already. I need my money, this week, so I can start buying gifts and such. I don't want to be in the Christmas Crowd. They always piss me off. So, hopefully I'll get paid this week. I better, or I'll be so fucking mad. And I'm not even kidding. I'm still in debt, and I..that reminds me.

There's a winter dance December 11th. Its semi-formal, and I need semi-formal clothes. If my money arrives, I'll buy khakis, and wear a white dress shirt. Problem: I need a date. Ahahaha. That'll never happen, so I mine as well forget it. Myself getting a date is like a homosexual thinking lesbians are hot..or something like that. You know what I mean."

Myself and Chris worked on it, and we will be receiving 100 a piece for our work. That will help myself greatly for the Christmas shopping.

But today, I feel like my energy was zapped out of me. I didn't sleep all that great, and I've got school tomorrow, so I'm expecting one hell of a week. I have to stay over for Drama practice Monday..and Tuesday..and Thursday. I'm so tired of school, working..it's just blowing my mind.

Chris was 'bored' last night, and built a linux box. Then he has the nerve to expect me to download something for him on it. It's friggin 4 gigs, and I don't want to download it. The only reason I am right now, is because he did offer me the chance to make some money by working on the catalog. And one more thing that I'm being grouchy about..and I guess I don't know why.

I want BBQ chicken. I'm not kidding. But...there's no way for me to have BBQ chicken..so I'm aggrivated about that. I've drank OJ and ate Chex cereal for three days straight, and they expect me to do it again? I don't think so. I'm just tired."

""Your granny is coming over tomorrow for Thanksgiving."" I looked at him, nodding slightly, my bangs falling into my eyes, ""Uh..cool."" Dad continued, ""Your Uncle Kevin..Aunt Gloria, Aunt Regina is coming too.""

My mind; WTF. This is the side of family I don't care about. My uncle Kevin acts like he's always got a problem, and takes it out on people. I love my granny. She's nice. My aunts..eh..nevermind about them.

I guess the problem is, it's breaking what I've always known as Thanksgiving. I'd wake up around 9-10, and I would sit in the living room, watching the Thanksgiving Parade with my mom. Then, the turkey would be ready to eat. It would be just us..my parents, and myself. Now, it's them. I hate it. I really do. I don't like this change. 

Still bugging me."

She was a Senior, I was a Freshman.
I bought her roses, I gave her candy.
I thought I could do it.
I was shot down.
I'm mostly over it, now.
My friend, Billie Jo Hensley was murdered.
I *hated* my school for their lack of respect, and my classmates for their idiocy.
I get along with my parents.
I help anyone, any way I can.

I'm RP'ing like mad with Usagi. It's so great, that she's on the internet a lot for RP. It may be a small thing to Usagi, but it means a lot to me that she puts up with me. Thanks, Usagi.

Today wasn't too bad. I've got Upward Bound classes tonight, from 6 to 8. I'm in quilting..which sucks. I can't quilt! I can barely keep myself from stabbing the pin into my thumb. It sucks. I've got some friends there, but it still sucks. I hope things go well tonight."

She was born in 1985, a senior at my high school. She was killed Sunday night, she was found in her house, where she had been brutually stabbed 151 times by her brother, and brother's friend. She may be gone, but she will never be forgotten.

        I just read the previous entries..what the hell was that. That wasn't even me. I guess everyone has their bad times..but damn! That was pretty pathetic. Anyway, I'm back..up on the top, I think. Hopefully I won't fall that bad as I did.


I shouldn't, because I..I just can't! Oh man, is it late. I really got to get to bed, but I've got some stuff to get rid of. Nothing has happened much until recently. In my Family/Child development class, a chef came in and cooked.

Well, of course I've loved to cook, but never thought to take it as something serious..until now. So now I'm in between being a cop, or being a chef. So it's a widestretch of what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.

My father, wasn't too supportive of me. He told me he thought it was a bad idea and such, but I think he should at least be supportive of me. He is my father, you know. Well, it pretty much upset me because I'm kind of a parent pleaser, Yeah, if you don't like that... ..|..O_o

Anyway, I'm getting off track here. I called my grandmother (Mammaw) She is the coolest grandmother I could ever have. I talked to her, and she gave my dad a talking, and it seemed to work. If I wasn't at home, my mother was going to chew my father out so bad for not being supportive.

Kind of great if you ask me, that I've got a some-what loving family. But now, he's supportive, and it's all good. I've been playing Ragnarok Online again, and it's getting better. I've been writing, some, and it's good. 

Damn, I've been writing for 10 mins. I've gotta get flying!
Anyway, anyway! That's where we are right now. And one more thing!!

Mrs. Tybor (My 4th period teacher) She's the greatest. I couldn't ask for a better teacher. She was reading a book to us (Hey hey..it was a good book. Something about an abused child, getting away from it.) And her daughter came to visit, (Stupid whore. ((Not Joking.))) 

She had her 2 year old kid, (Told you.) and so she had her kid distract Mrs. Tybor, while she tied her shoestrings to her stool. She started to cry! That really made me mad. (Stupid whore.) So then, Mrs. Tybor told her to go. (So Mrs. Tybor can collect the money on the weekend ;D)

One more thing!!! 

I've been listening to Real Radio, a talk show that is awesome. They're stationed down in Orlando, thanks to internet connection, I can listen to it. But, it's a great talk show, I love the Monsters in the morning, (Go Savannah!) Phillips Phile is great, (Gotta love Jana Banana) And finally, the Drew Show. (Tuds!) But yeah yeah..that's it.

I'm done already. Now I'm heading to sleep. Nighters."

"event","Friday was great. When I went in the cafeteria to sit, I seen a pack of M&M's hanging in a machine, so I had a friend shake the machine for me, and I got the M&M's, Yay! My day was really good, I didn't really have much problems, except for my friggin throat. It's starting to hurt.

Saturday, Tax refunds came. Shopping o rama, whoohoo! too bad I was sick, though. I didn't do much on that day. I bought a new 20' TV, which is awesome. So yeah..that's mostly it.

Today, Monday..

I really wouldn't want to talk about it. I had to go to McDonalds again tonight, and Lashanda was there! I wanted to cry, again. It' not fair for me that I have to see her! I can't just truly be happy. I can be happy for her, but not myself. What the hell do I have to be happy about?

A few things. But not much. Whenever I try to get out..people bail on me, and nothing happens. Just like this one girl on the bus. This was getting on the campus bus at Tusculum College to go to the science lab. I sat with her..and she was mad because I did that! What did I do to her?!

Nothing! I was just being friendly. I'd really like to know what's wrong with me. I'm nice to everyone..but not everyone is nice to me. Those bastards! I just pictured something in my mind. It wasn't of my control, either. 

I pictured mself crying in my third period class, to one of my friends, Brittni. I cried on her shoulder, repeating the words, ""I'm gonna die alone."" I managed to get this thought out of my head. And..really. Last thing. God knows I'll be getting yelled about this.

Tonight, I found out..that Usagi kind of..had a love. Her name was Amy. I knew Usagi was bi, but I really didn't think she liked a girl. I never knew, at least. I don't have a problem with it, I mean, it's none of my business to say anything about it if I did like it or not. But I don't have any problems about it. If it makes her happy, then great.

But..what if I had a..crush or something of my own? And that person just walked away, and never came back? What would I do? I don't know. I don't even want to think it..and tonight is a bad night for thinking if you ask me. Typing is bad enough, because it's expressing my thoughts.

That's..really enough for tonight. I don't want to go any further."

"event","I thought things were getting better. They were at one point, really. Until tonight, I really noticed something. I love my parents to death, don't get me wrong, but it seems I can't really do stuff with friend's that often, or something of the sort. And then, I seen Lashanda at McDonalds. 

I love (backspace that.) Anyway, I really don't like going to McDonalds, but dad wanted a salad. So we went, and then I saw her. She waved at me happily, and of course, being the dumb person I am, I waved back happily. But..it seemed like she was taunting me in a way.

And it really makes me mad that I couldn't do anything with her. And yet she's always happy it seems. I know no one is happy all the time, but she's pretty, and she's got great qualities. Why shouldn't she be happy? I don't know. It just kind of gets to me about things like that.

And my friend Brittni. God knows I like her, but sometimes she seems so much different. It seems no one likes me sometimes. But other times, I feel like I fit in. Maybe that's how the ball bounces. She's going through some stupid drama with her ex boyfriend and shiz, and I really don't want to think about it.

Last but not least, I had to get something off of my shoulders. It seems like the internet is nothing but a fake reality to get away from, and still then, it's more of a bitch than life sometimes. Sometimes I feel like quitting it, because I think, ""Hey, they don't care. It's just another nickname they don't have to watch for.""

Sometimes I would feel like a burden. Or I can't help people out. I just..I can't describe it. I seem like some kid who doesn't understand. Maybe that's what I'm getting at. I want to be something better, dammit! Not just some kid who is annoying and never does anything good.

You'd think nice guys wouldn't finish last. But damn them all, they do finish last. And it's not cool anymore to be nice. You've got to be some bastard for chicks to like you. What the hell is up with that? If some chick has a great response to that, just email me at Illuminati01@Adelphia.net.

I really hope things get better. I can't take much more of this. I just seem to get on people's nerves when I try and communicate with them, and it doesn't work out. I'm not saying who this is about, or why I'm saying it. I'm saying it because if I don't let it out here, it's just going to keep on bugging me until I'm gonna explode or something. I have no clue.

When you think someone is the hilight of your life, that things wouldn't be the same without'em, they start to grow distant from you, and things do indeed get worse. I hate it."

She seems to have a really interesting life. (Yeah..I read her journal.) Anyway..I'm starting to become mentally ill. I can notice the difference in me. I'm..not really happy as I was anymore. I tried talking to Usagi. She told me that she needed her friends, and that's all.

What if I don't have any real life friends to count on? Maybe I could count on Chris..but he'd back out. So I'm just..alone, now. If I didn't live in damned hicksville, I could probably do stuff! I've always imagined like, one summer day, going to a big big town, where you could walk and stuff.

And meet up with friends and do stuff. But..it's not like that. I'm just stuck in my room. My mom and dad..they can't help. So that's about it. I told myself today, that, ""I'll end up being a cold bastard if I keep up this attitude."" And..I don't care if I do.

I'm just not..truly happy as I once was. I don't know why, I really don't. So it's whatever.

Damn me! I'm such a dumbass for it! I nearly cried. I didn't mean to..I really didn't. I felt like killing myself. Well..My parents weren't mad at all, to my surprise. In Family/Child Development, I'm sitting all alone now, and I'm starting to kill myself.

I hate being lonely. I really do. And Usagi came on..I went to talk to her..and it went straight to hell. We somehow got on the topic about her date or something on monday..or something. I tried to help out or something, and I ended up being classified as a *guy*. I'll never understand because I'm a *guy*.

I want the best for Usagi, and if I ever said anything, she'd get mad, and be like, ""Don't get attached to me."" Or something, I'm guessing. Even if I said that, she would be really mad at me because I don't *know* her, and it'd take forever for her to talk to me.

It's funny. I know I'm doing something wrong. Why am I giving advice about dating when the hell I've never got a girlfriend before in my entire life? Never, NOT ONCE! Never been on a date...and yeah. I'm an ugly fucker, that's what it is. And hell, I'll give a link to my pic!

I just talked with her on the phone the other day..it tickled me to death. I loved hearing her! I really did, I'd love to talk with her on the phone more often.

But, that's not gonna happen. I'm such a dumbass about girls and stuff. Maybe I know why those girls moved to another table in fourth. I just suck. That's it. Flat out. I should even stop looking for one. I just can't do it. I...just can't. I'm not worth it.

I did this for a little while, then she spreaded her legs! Jeez! Both eyes went to attention, and my typing on my paper looked sort of like this. ""And that's why I........................................................nelievs tat famiues a'idkjwfijkdfskcv;kdsk;ew;/kj;kdsfk;jdsf""

I had to end up getting ready to go to the woods, so we could cut up wood for the stove, because next week, dad's gonna be in the hospital. Not surgery, thank god. They're just gonna keep him under observation, to see why he has his seizures. I hope they find it out, and whatever.

And dad finally let me use a chainsaw! Waaaaarrrraaawwrrr! It's so awesome, cutting up wood. I like it. Heh. I did pretty good, but I just need to pay attention to the chainsaw, instead of looking around. Well, anyway, after getting the wood cut, we went home.

We were talking, and I noticed on one of those things that doctors tell you to read, and when you go down, the letters get small, you know?

Well, about the eighth line, I see the words, ""P O T"" And I'm like @_@;; ...really. All of a sudden, I tell Mark, and we start making jokes. Me and Mark are now the P O T busters, with our Dirt Devils, we shall get pot! Then all of a sudden, Mark said, ""Do you know Puff The Magic Dragon?"" I started laughing. It was funny, of course.

I told him I didn't, and then he said, ""Would you like to puff my Magic Dragon?"" Oh my god..that was so funny. I couldn't keep it in. But nothing else in particular struck me as funny.

Fourth Period...is awesome. It's all girls!! I'm sitting..with two hot girls. Renee Massy...and Amanda Jones. 

If I didn't know better, I'd say Amanda Jones  could be a professional model for some magazine, or something. She's really that nice looking to me. I've been impressing all the ladies in the class, just to make friends, I suppose. But I hope I get to be really good friends with them.

Second Period...sucks. I've got this old lady with boobs that sag more than her face. Lol..that's funny. But she's sort of nice, but she can be a real bitch, too. I've been on her good side, and funny thing is, every teacher I have now knows my name, and doesn't have to say my full name. 

That's cool, I think. I think I've ran out of stuff to talk about...I think. I'm just really bored now, wondering what to do. I'm waiting on Usagi to get home from school, so I can talk to her, and stuff. She really brightens my day up. I'm glad she can, and I don't mean to be a downer to her sometimes.

I think that's about it...and...stuff. I guess I'll write later."

"event","Thanks to Usagi...I'm really feeling better now. We RP'ed for a few hours..and it really made me feel better. And just having her with me, makes me feel better. She's really nice, and I wish I could give her anything in the world. She's really...something.

After Usagi being there for me, I do have something to live for. I'm just not sure what it is. I really don't. Maybe I'll find out, someday. I'm still not eating, though. I don't like the way I look..so I'll lose some weight. School is today...I really should get some sleep. I feel like school may be a good week. MAYBE. People always sometimes can be a jackass, so it depends on who I have classes with, etc.,

I'm a bit more stable in the mental department, and I think I'm gonna be okay. I may be a little extreme on the weight loss..but if I end up in the hospital..I end up there, right? Well, anyway. I think I'm off for bed. I think I have everything ready."

"event","My days are starting to look different, I suppose. I'm starting to eat less, practically starting to starve myself. I don't mind, though. I don't know if I have much left to really love, besides my Mom and Dad. I have friends, I know. But, things are starting to slip away from me, it seems.

And....any crushes I currently have (1) or I have...had. (1) I know it's not going to work...and it never will! This is basically the only place I can stress...because, I don't want to bring this down on my friends...and my parents don't understand. School starts back tomorrow...and I'm not going to eat anything there, all day. 

I just sit here, on the computer, all day long. I pity myself for that. I don't have anything to live for. I'm not going to commit suicide...don't get me wrong. I'm just to the point, where...I'm alone, in a...someone being there for me thing. And where I live now..just a bunch of rednecks..and chicks that think their something..that aren't.

I..don't know. I...maybe I'll get over this. Most likely not. I'm just gonna starve myself. When I go to school..I'll just..be away from everyone. Not talk to anyone...and stuff. I may be popular..but..It's not going to get me ANYWHERE in life.

I think I cried myself to sleep last night. I've never done that before, ever. I'm starting to get in tears right now. I'm just stupid..that's all. There's this one girl, I really care about. But...those feelings will never be returned. It happened like this with Lashanda, and..it would happen like this with her.

I don't know how this week will turn out, but..I'm not even sure what to think. I want to do all I can..but..I can't. I'm gonna quit eating...and stuff. I'm tired of it...I want to be something..someone...not known as that kid who runs his mouth...or something like that.

I'll try, that's all I can do. I...most likely won't get over this..I've said before...and..I won't. But I will not bring others down with me. I refuse to do that. I will not deprive others of happiness. I'll do this alone, go into it, and I won't come back out."

"event","I've really been busy lately, and I've wanted to update my journal.  I don't mean to brag, but I gotta tell what I got over Christmas!

Final Fantasy X-2
Laptop Carrying Case
50$

Yeah, I  know you all probably got something better, but I like what I got. I've been playing Final Fantasy X like mad, lately. I don't want to play X-2 until I beat X, ya know? Well, I've been in a frenzy about that. You don't know how long the game really is until you play it.

I'll probably use that 50$ to buy .hack//OUTBREAK. Yeah, I'm a mad gamer anymore. My friend Chris has been coming over lately. He's cool and stuff. We used to so go at it our Freshman year. He was sort of snotty, I think. But, he's over it, and that's good and stuff.

And I've been trying to help Davis. Davis is a good friend of mine. His girlfriend dumped him, and he really really loved her. So he's really down in the dumps, and I've been trying to help him. I hope I can. Trying to change the subject is a bit hard, but I'm progessing, I suppose.

I think I'm the only one that understands him. Well, it seems I do, anyway. I understand his problem, because of what happened to me last year, with Lashanda. It may have been a sort of different situation, but it ended up the same way in feelings, I think.

My mom just recently got out of the hospital for Heart Surgery. I knew she was gonna make it, but I always thought, what if she didn't. Bad part is, I was preparing myself if mom...passed away. I was also preparing myself because I know she was going to be connected to a bunch of machines.

But, she's okay now, and thank god she is. What else on the agenda...Oh! Well. I hang out in a mIRC channel. This chick so pisses me off! She has me on ignore, but she talks about her yaoi, and whatever. I bet I've already ranted about her. But anyway.

I Instant Message her over MSN, telling her Merry Christmas, and she puts me on ignore! That's being bitchy, and...just being bitchy! God, She needs to get a stupid life. At least some kind of life! *sigh* I don't know what to do with her. But I'm not letting her ruin me, no sir.

I really think that's about it.  I'll probably play FFX soon, and then try and beat it tonight, so I can play X-2. Then tomorrow, Chris is suppose to come over, but I gotta get .hack//OUTBREAK, so I'll probably go early in the morning to get it, then Chris will be over, so it'll be good."

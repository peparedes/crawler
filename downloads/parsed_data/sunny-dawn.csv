"event","Yeah, it's been a good while again since I've updated.  I've just been so busy lately that I don't really have time for all this mess.  I feel like I'm overwhelmed with room inspections, CQ, and pt.  My life doesn't consist of anything fun anymore.  When I go to the mall I'm always so worried that a drill sergeant will be around watching me.  The whole brain washing thing worked I suppose in basic.  

I can't wait to leave Alabama.  It's too damn hot here.  I don't think it would be that bad if the humidity wasn't evil here.  I'm so ready to get back to Kentucky for alittle while.  For the 4th I'm goin to Georgia with a few friends from here.  I was going to come home, but it's pointless.  

Stories of Fort Bragg are starting to scare me.  I don't really want to go there because I don't want to go airborne.  Granted that I run my 2 mile in like 14:45 I'm not ready to jump out of an airplane with a friggin ruck that weighs 115 pounds.  It weighs almost as much as I do.  I don't want to.  My drill sergeant really thinks it would be a good idea if I did that, but I don't.  For one, I'm kinda scared of heights.  I really didn't realize this until basic when we did a confidence course.  Not fun, not fun at all.  I'm so scared that I'm just going to fall if I get up really high.  I know, I'm retarted.  

Hopefully, I'm going to be out of here ASAP.  I start back in class Tuesday maybe.  I hope my orders change and I get sent to Fort Sill, OK.  I want to be there with all my friends.  Not in Fort Bragg.  My bestest friend leaves me in three weeks to go to Eglin Air Force Base in Fl.  She's is a dumbass and picked EOD as her MOS.  That wasn't smart at all.  My ""person"" left on May 23rd.  Yeah, I'm really sad.  We talk all the time, but it's still not the same.  I miss him so much.  Hopefully, Im going to get out of here soon and I can go see him.  

I supppose that I may stay in the army for a good while.  Once I think about it, even though I have gotten in trouble for retarded things I've done, It's really not that bad.  I mean, come on, I have abs now.  I wouldn't have them if I had some other job.  It's really okay I suppose.  Lol..I change my mind though on a daily basis.  Give it a few days and I'll be complaining about how I hate it.

I think that I'm going to go get a pair of BDU's today.  So I should probably go get ready."

"event","I feel that I have totally neglected my livejournal.  I had wanted one of these stupid things for so long, and now I'm just like fuck it.  I don't really have that much time for anything anymore.  That kinda sucks.

Anyways, I have surgery on my shoulder May 31st.  I'm scared because I don't want this doctor to fuck me up like he has everyone else.  I'm very nervous.  I hope that it works and I can get back to doing things again.  

I hate being hurt more than anything in the world.  I feel so bad for complaining though.  Yesterday I was reading in the Soldier magazine and there was this article on soldiers who had been hurt really bad, and still wanted to go back to Iraq.  My ass is hurt, but not that bad and I hate this.  I hate that I can't do anything and yes I do complain alot.  I want to go home.  I feel terrible about this.  I mean, I'm broken but not like these guys.  How am I gonna set and complain when I still have an arm to complain about?  

If everything goes good with my surgery I should be out of Alabama by August, in August I go to Fort Bragg, then in Feb I go to Iran.  Yeah, I'm scared.  I'm terrified.  But, I knew it was coming sooner or later.  I guess that I'm just gonna go over there, do my job, hope I don't die, and then come back to the states with all my stories.  I just hope I don't see alot of craziness.  I know that I will so, I don't know.  I want to go over there and make a difference.  I know that sounds retarded, but I really want to help those people.  Like, the little kids and stuff.  I'll want to bring them home with me.  I just hope that I don't have to shoot someone cause that would really mess with me.  The whole thought alone just makes me nervous.  I don't want to come back to the states all freaked out because of what I saw.  Things are gettin ready to get bad in Iran.  I'm not so sure if the Army wants to send me over there.  I just hope that I'll be okay.  

Enough of that.  I suppose I could write about some good stuff like someone that I care alot about.  There is someone that I do care alot about here.  He leaves in like 6 days though.  We came here together and stuff but I rolled in my classes because of being hurt and he finished. He's going to Fort Sill.  I'm really devastated.  I don't want him to go.  Lol, I've tried everything to get him to stay.  I want him to get an article 15 so he would have to stay, but that would be really unfair.  My cousin Eric (a marine) is stationed at Ft.Sill so maybe I'll get to see him when I go out there on leave.  Sad times for me.  I'll be okay though.  Everything will work itself out.

I suppose that's all for now.  I guess that I will try to update a little more often since all I do is sit in my room all day."

"event","Well, since I have no life anymore on Saturdays and I just spend most of the day listening to music and hanging out at the PX, I discovered a new song.  It's probably not you to you guys, but to me it is because I haven't heard real music in forever and I'm just now trying to catch up on everything I missed.  So, I heard Here By Me by 3 Doors Down today and was cryin my eyes out in the PX.  My friend was like, ""wow Helton, you're really emotional.""  I was like, ""Yeah (sniff sniff) I really am.""  Everyone was cracking up, but that song made me really sad for some reason.  

I honestly don't have a reason to be sad, I guess.  In a way I kinda do.  I'm sure everyone knows that reason too, so there is no need to explain.  But, it seems like the further away I am, the worse things get.  It's just not me this time, it's him too.  I really hope that's a good thing.  I know, I'm crazy for even feeling like I do.  I can't help it though.  There is just something about him that I'm going to always love.  I'm such a stupid ass and the majority of ya'll think I am too because I think so too.  That's okay though, I'm content with that.  You guys just don't understand though.  We've both grown up a whole lot since May.  We've made plenty of changes in our lives and that's a good thing.  I think our changes have kinda brought us closer because mine was a little more life threatening than his.  Things are good right now.  I'm happy with us, for a change.  Even though there isn't really a us.  Our situation will always be really confusing.

So, I suppose that I should probably go now.  I've vented alittle bit and kinda feel alright now.  I'm not all sad cry times anymore."

"event","So, last night around 7:30 I hear, ""Come out in the hall with your kevlars on...Tornado drill.""  I was kinda cool with the idea at first because I knew we wouldn't be that long.  Well, that long turned out to be 5 freakin hours out in the hallway with hail the size of golf balls covering the ground, wind goin 90 miles an hour, electricity blinking, and all kinds of other crazy stuff.  I was so scared.  I had never in my life went through anything like that.  I was freaking out while everyone else was all calm and chill layin out in the hallway like nothin was happening and there was a tornado 3 miles away from us.  No, I was very upset.  I hated not being in a hallway with a bunch of people that stink and were bein loud and stupid on top of being scared for my life.  No, never again.

Anyways, after that was all over the let us go back to our rooms and go to bed.  This morning I got up and looked outside and there were freakin tree limbs everywhere, stuff knocked over, and all kinds of other stuff.  I was just like, ""wow.""  But, everything is okay now.  The drill sergeants are making the people who have extra duty clean all that up.  What's funny though is that after they do all that, we're supposed to get severe thunderstorms again today.  How wonderful, right?

But, now for fun stuff.  I got this email from my cousin and it kinda made me think.  It was called some things to think about.



Here are a few things to think about while you are relaxing....... 





Can you cry under water? 





How important does a person have to be before they are considered 
assassinated instead of just murdered? 





Why do you have to ""put your two cents in"".. .    but it's only a ""penny for 
your thoughts""?  Where's that extra penny going to? 





Once you're in heaven, do you get stuck wearing the clothes you were buried 
in for eternity? 




Why does a round pizza come in a square box? 




What disease did cured ham actually have? 





How is it that we put man on the moon before we figured out it would be a 
good idea to put wheels on luggage? 




Why is it that people say they ""slept like a baby"" when babies wake up like 
every two hours? 




If a deaf person has to go to court, is it still called a hearing? 





Why are you IN a movie, but you're ON TV? 




Why do people pay to go up tall buildings and then put money in binoculars to 
look at things on the ground? 





Why do doctors leave the room while you change?  They're going to see you 
naked anyway. 





Why is ""bra"" singular and ""panties"" plural 





Why do toasters always have a setting that burns the toast to a horrible 
crisp, which no decent human being would eat? 





If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares, why is there a stupid song about him? 





Can a hearse carrying a corpse drive in the carpool lane? 




If the professor on Gilligan's Island can make a radio out of a coconut, why 
can't he fix a hole in a boat? 




Why do people point to their wrist when asking for the time, but don't point 
to their crotch when they ask where the bathroom is? 





Why does Goofy stand erect while Pluto remains on all fours?  They're both 
dogs! 




If Wiley E. Coyote had enough money to buy all that ACME crap, why didn't he 
just buy dinner? 




If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, 
what is baby oil made from? 




If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from morons? 




Do the Alphabet song and Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star have the same tune?




Did you ever notice that when you blow in a dog's face, he gets mad at you, 
but when you take him for a car ride; he sticks his head out the window? 


I will write more when I have time."

"event","Well, I get the Red Cross message that my uncle is sick and I need to come home.  Okay, I talk to the drill sergeants and everyone last night.  I found a flight to louisville that's super cheap.  All I'm waiting on is my captain to okay everything.  So, I'm possiblily Harlan bound tomorrow.  I'll be home for like 9 or 10 days.  I hope the captain isn't going to be mean and not let me come home.  I would be really sad.  But, that's all for now."

I can't wait!  I'm ready to get my orders and go wherever it is that they want to send me.  :D!  They said there is a chance that I could be going to either Germany or Hawaii!  That'd be most awesome.  That's one thing that I really like about the Army.  It's that I get to go places.  That'll be wonderful!!!! 

I guess I should go, I have things to do.  Much love homies!  Lol"

"event","So, today was inprocessing.  IT SUCKED.  Oh my gaah, we had to sit in this room and listen to all these people talk all day long.  It was terrible.  Then I found out that I don't start my class until like next week.  So, that means I'll be on details a whole lot.  I don' mind though, it's still a hella lot better than basic.

Theresa and I had a talk last night.  We talked about what's going to happen to me when I get deployed.  I know it's going to happen and all, I just don't want to come back all crazy like the majority of people do.  I don't want post dramatic stress disorder.  I know that I'm not going to be on the front line or anything, but I know that it may come down to me shooting someone to defend myself.  That kinda makes me nervous.  My cousin Eric is really crazy.  He's a completely different person and I really don't want to end up like that.  Theresa told me I shouldn't worry about all that mess now, which I really shouldn't.  I should just make it through AIT and then wait 6 months or however long before it takes before I deploy. Enough about that.

I know that if I keep my head straight and don't do dumb shit I'll be fine.  There are so many people here that have done stupid stuff.  Like, everyone has article 15's and all this shit.  I'm not going to screw up and have to stay here any longer than I have too.  10 weeks is long enough.  There are people here that have been here like 20 weeks and stuff.  They do dumb shit.  OH MY GAAH!  They're so undisciplined.  You wouldn't believe how stupid these people act.  I can't stand how they're always moving around in formation and talking.  There are people here that I don't see how they've passed their pt test.  There is a guy that can only do 20 pushups.  That's terrible.  My ass is going to be going to the gym when I'm finished with everything and I'm also going to study.  I don't want to end up like all these other people.  I didn't join the Army to do dumb shit.  

Anyways, my brother laughed at me today because I started my sentence with, ""When I was at basic...""  I have so many stories though.  I'm sure ya'll will here them all.

Before I go, I must tell ya'll about this lady I saw today.  SHE LOOKED LIKE STRAIGHT ALABAMA TRASH.  It was by far one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life.  She had bleach blonde hair, really high red heels, tight black pants, and a super tight white shirt that just like barely covered her boobs, and last but certainly not least, her makeup...That's all I have to say about that.  I'm sure that you can just picture her.  It was soooooooooooooooooooooooo funny.  

Now, I'm finished."

"event","Well..Basic was fun.  I made it through and did well.   My drill seregeants were actually pretty laid back. I didn't really get in that much trouble.  I did end up doing a whole lot of push ups though because I smile.  

It's hard going from civilian life to soldier life.  There were so many changes that I had to go through.  I really am way more up tight about things now.  On Thursday which was family day I didn't talk to anyone when I was eating and I was done in like 6 mins top.  I've gotten so used to stuff like that it's just hard to come back to a place where I have freedom.  I get my cell phone back Tuesday when I pass my PT test which will be a breeze because I can do 54 pushups, 71 situps, and run my 2 miles in 15:06.  I can wear civilian clothes again, and I only have one person in a room with me.  Oh my gosh, taking a shower in private again is wonderful.  I share a bathroom with four people, but that's a whole lot better than 60.  

Basic was a great experience.  Just like everyone else, I hated it when I first got there.  But, after about 2 weeks I started adapting and things became easier.  I didn't realize how out of shape I was until I got there too.  I've lost about 20 pounds and I've gained some abs!  Yay!  Lol.  My aunt was so shocked when she saw me Thursday.  They said I didn't even look like the same person.  I suppose that's a good thing.

My political views haven't really changed any.  I mean, It's different now when I hear American Soldier, or I watch the news and see that a Soldier has died.  I still don't like George Bush at all.  I'm not scared of deploying anymore because I know what I'm doing.  I'm proud of myself for doing this and I guess that's all that matters.

I'm sure you guys will here more about basic and AIT and stuff.  But right now, I'm really hungry so I'm going to go eat."

"event","So, I have a little less than a week before I leave.  I don't know but, the nervous feeling is way worse now than before.  Everytime it is mentioned to me, I just want to die.  I'm not second guessing myself, I'm just nervous because I suppose I should have a right to be.  What if I can't do this?  What if I get there and they're mean to me because I can't do it?  What if I get there and they tell me that I'm not going to be able to graduate because I couldn't pass the PT test.  This is something I really want to do, but I just have a terrible feeling that I'm not going to be able to.  People keep telling me, ""If so and so can do it, I know you can.""  But the thing is, I'm not so and so.  I'm Dawn who made a C in gym.  This is really worrying me.

I'm just to the point where if I go and there is the slightest chance of me coming home, I will lay on the ground, roll around, and scream and say that I'm crazy.  That way if I do come home it will be because I'm crazy, not that I'm not able to handle it.  I know that is terrible and maybe I am just stressing myself out for no reason at all.  I don't know though.  I'm just scared.  

I'm scared because of not knowing what to expect.  I'm scared because I know that as soon as someone gets in my face I'm just going to burst into tears.  What if I did make a bad decision in doing this?  I don't really think I did, I'm just saying.  I don't want to make anyone who is proud of me, not to be proud of me anymore because I couldn't handle basic training.  

Maybe I should take on a whole new approach at this thing and think that I'm going to get in there and do wonderful.  I really am going to try hard and I'm going to give 100%.  I'm just scared my 100% won't be enough."

"event","Well, I leave for basic in 11 days.  I've been waking up with this sick feeling in my stomach.  I'm scared.  I'm not scared because I don't think that I can handle it, I'm scared because I just don't want to go to Iraq.  I know basic will be hard.  But, that isn't bothering me as much as the thought of going overseas is.  I've worked my butt off for months trying to get ready for this, but I don't know now.  This is something that I want to do, no doubt because of the good benefits and money, but I'm terrified.  Lol.  I know that I'm probably just stressing myself out over nothing.  For the past few days, everytime someone mentions it to me I want to passout.  

This is not fun.  This wouldn't be that bad if I didn't get the sick feeling everytime a commercial comes on tv for the Army, or when I see the Call of Duty thing.  That really scares me.    

Last night I was laying in my bed crying because it hit me last night that this is real.  I can't back out of this, there is no turning back.  I've already sworn in and all that stuff so I can't just show up on my ship date at MEPS and say, ""I'm sorry, but I've changed my mind.  I'm going home now.""  That would be terrible.  

I'm just in for four years and that's really not that bad.  I just keeping assuring myself that I'm going to be fine and that this is a good thing.  

Someone in my family told me that me and Bobby would be the ones who did something with our lives.  I suppose that I should be proud, considering there is only one of my cousins that have done something with their life and that's all out of the whole family. 

Oh well.  I can't get out of it now and I'm stuck, so I shouldn't worry because I know that I'm going to be just fine.  Lol"

Last night around 4:29 I got up because my stomach was hurting super bad.  So, I made my way to the bathroom and now I am dying because since then I've thrown up every 20 mins.  Stupid stomach virus.  A girl I go to church with gave it to Kristan, Kristan gave it to Gracie, Gracie gave it to me and Jeremy, Gracie also gave it to Debbie, Amber, Josh, and Billy.  Everyone I know is sick.  I want to cut my stomach out and just die.  Lol.  It wouldn't e that bad if i didn't have so much stuff i have to do today like, go to walmart and get my christmas layway out, go to the bank and so much more.

Okay, first of all I haven't ran on anything but a tredmil in years and second of all I'm not active.  Sure, I go to the gym..But I don't think that really has anything to do with running in the rain and it 20 degrees outside.  

I ran the mile in 12 mins and 10 seconds..Not bad.  But by the time I was finished I couldn't decided if I had to throw up or if I wanted to pass out.  So I just laid on the track in the rain.  I wanted to die.  I couldn't move my legs.  So now, PT is at 5:45 every morning.  I don't want to.  I'm just gonna go die.  Stupid diets and junk.  Why the heck do you have to run like that anyways?  If I'm in danger, yeah I'm gonna book away from what ever it is that it trying to get/hurt me.  But not just for the sake of running I'm not gonna do it.  Lol.  I think that basic is gonna suck hardcore for me.

On another hand, I'm super excited about coming home.  I miss Harlan and I can't wait to see everyone.  :D!  Yay.  Lol.  Although there is one person that I'm so super happy about seeing, even though I promised I wouldn't see them.  Lol..I'm a bad g/f.

About being a bad g/f...sometimes I really wonder if I am a good one..Lol  I mean, I know he done one really stupid thing and it kinda ruined things.  But he made up for it with the snow.  BUT, sometimes I catch myself thinking about someone else or talking to someone else and it kinda makes me a feel.  But, technically I'm not cheating on him.  What he did was cheating.  I've not went out with anyone or anything since I've been with him. I'm happy with him.  I really really care about him and I don't want to hurt him, but I'm scared about going to Harlan.  that may mess things up..Lol

Honestly, I'm not worried.  Things could be worse I suppose, so I should stop complaining about things like Iraq and start complaining about my breaks going out today.  Yeah, I was at a yeild place, only I couldn't yeild because my brakes didn't want to.  They just stopped working and it was pouring.  I couldn't stop at red lights or for other cars or anything.  I was in tears before I reached work.  See...I could die anytime so I shouldn't be worried about dying in Iraq.  I think that was a sign or something.  I know one thing though, that was one of the scariest things I've ever had happen to me.

I had to fill out this paper today that gave permisson for my name to be put in my hometown newspaper that I joined the army.  That's gonna be funny.  I can hear it now.  Fun times.

Yesterday, I had to change my job or whatever for the Army.  What I wanted to do had no jobs open....So as of now when I get finished with my training my ass is heading to Iraq.  I'm a f'n amo specialist.  What the heck?  I did very well in like repair and stuff on that stupid test I took, so there for I got a bunch of stupid jobs that came up.  I just guessed on all of those.  I didn't mean it.  :(

I'm very scared now.  Before it was just a little bit.  Not now.  I have to go to Missouri for basic then to Alabama for AIT.  I'm so scared.  I don't want to go to Iraq and get blown up.  Maybe they won't need amo specialist for a while or maybe they will because all the other ones got blown up.  
:(.  I've felt like crying since yesterday because now I'm stuck doing a scary job that I can't get out of for four years.  I don't want to die in Iraq.  Stupid president.  Stupid war.  If I die in Iraq, I'm so gonna come back and haunt George Bush.  I'll make his life terrible because it will be because of him that I ruined mine.  I know that I'm old enough to make my own decisions and I knew that this would happen inventually, I am just very scared of what could happen.  I knew that there was a war going on, so I don't really need to blame our stupid president for me going the Army because then I sound like that Owens girls mom.  I could understand if we were fighting a war for a reason, but there is no reason  behind this.  Just higher gas prices and a bunch of speeches that assure us we're doing the right thing.  NUH UH GEORGE BUSH!  Lol.  Hopefully I'll be okay.  I've just gotta keep positive and not thinking about getting killed by a bomb or someone dropping a missle on my me.

By the way, I leave January 3rd."

"event","Well...Today I took my physical for the Army.  Let me tell you.  I was on a bus ready to go to at 5:15.  I was up at 4.  I've had such a long day.  

We get at the MEPS place and there's like 4 girls there and I made the fifth.  2 of the girls were leaving today for boot camp so they didn't have to do the full physical.  The physical was insane.  The lady comes in the room with me and the two other girls, gives us these like blue sheet things and says, ""Completely undress leaving nothing on but your socks.""  Let me remind you, there are no curtains or anything in this room.  She checked our weight, height, and body fat.  Then she sent me first into the ""exam room.""  I had heard many terrible things about the ""exam room.""  It wasn't bad at all.  All she did was look to see if everything was okay.  It honestly didn't take like 2 mins at the most.  After all of us got checked we then had to put our bra and panties on and stand in a straight line and do the physical part, which wasn't bad at all either.  

The whole female part of the physical was over.  After that my hearing, vison, and blood work was done.  So all that's left for me to do is swear in.  That'll probably be next Monday or Tuesday.  I got super nervous this morning.  I can't turn back now.  I already signed my contract.  I'm in for four years.  I'll be fine though.  It's not a big deal.  I'm very proud of myself.

There was more to all this stuff, but I honestly am too tired to type anymore.  I'm eating then I'm going to bed.."

The reason being is because of all the benefits.  I know that boot camp is not going to be easy at all.  But I only have 6 pounds to lose before I leave in January.  I'll only be an hour away from my aunt so she can come see me.  I'm going into human resources.  So there is like a one percent chance of me going to Iraq.  Even if I do get sent there, it'll be okay because I won't be close to a battlefield.  I've questioned the Army for a long time.  No Marines, Navy, or Airforce for me.  Marines is way hard, Navy involves way too much water, and Aiforce is hard.  Lol.  

My sister didn't take the news that well the day I told her.  She said that she didn't want a letter from me or anything and I was crushed.  How can she say something like that?  BUT THEN, yesterday she changed her mind and she told me that she was proud of me and she was sorry.  That made me feel so much better.

I was so tired of everyone telling me that I should do this, this, and this.  I'm 6 days away from being 19, I do not need anyone to make my mind up for me.  This will give me a chance to go places away from North Carolina and Kentucky.  I hope that for some reason they send me to Germany that way I can go to France and Italy.  I'm proud of myself and for the first time I've done something that no one told me to do that is going to be good for me.  Bobby, you're probably mad at me.  But don't be, I love you!  Megan got over it, so can you.  I'm not doing anything because of the war, I honestly don't want to go to Iraq, but that falls in with it.  If I get sent, oh well.  I'll be okay...They teach me to use guns!  Lol :)

Well...I have to get ready for work sometime.  I hate wearing khakis all the time.  Stupid dress code.  I'm in layway...Why can't I wear jeans if I'm going to be climbing up bin to get people's f'n things?  Lol"

"event","I watched Big Fish yesterday and I cried all the way through it.  It makes me think of my dad.  He would always tell me crazy stuff when I was little.  I believed him for a long time.  Then the whole time he was in the hospital and he would like talk out of his head he would say crazy stuff.  One of the nurses told us that when people talk out of their heads like that they usually reflect on things that have happened to them.  If that's true then I hate to have known all the stuff that dad had done.  One morning I was sitting in a chair and dad was like, ""Dawn, do you have your gun?""  I said, ""Yeah dad...I've got it.""  He said, ""Well good..Because if they come in here I want you to shoot them.  They're going to try to steal all the money that I've got put up in the drawer by the refrigerator.""  I said, ""Dad who's going to come in here?""  He said, ""The police.  I'm not going to let them take me to jail""  I just agreed with everything he said, because if you didn't he'd get really mad.  I don't know.  When he did stuff like that I didn't know what to say.  In the past few years I've figured out alot of stuff about my dad that I really shouldn't have found out.  I didn't know how to feel about everything I heard because that's my daddy.  I know what I heard was true because of who it came from.  I just think that was stuff that I should've never found out about.  I mean, I can't be mad at him now.  So I guess it's pointless to even think about being mad.  It just kinda hurt to know that it happened.  I know that dad changed when he started going to church and stuff and I'm sure he was really sorry for everything that he did in the past.  I guess if God can forgive him..I can too.

Yesterday, my cousin and I were talking about me getting married and stuff.  It hit me then that I'm not going to have my dad to walk me down the aisle.  Then I decided I was gonna walk my own self down the aisle because I don't want anyone to get mad at me.  The first person that came to my mind was my uncle Gary but, I'll probably end up getting married here and that's a really long drive.  Then I have my brother and I know that he'd be so mad if I didn't get him to do it.  Then I thought about my uncle David, but he'll probably be doing the wedding. So I think that I'm not gonna need anyone to do it.  I'll be just fine all by myself.  Talking about that made me think of all the stuff that my parents have missed.  I think the hardest was my Musette senior night.  Everyone was all up there with their parents and I was with Caroline's mom.  My sister wouldn't come because her son had a baseball game.  Dillon never played.  He was usually put in the last inning so it wouldn't have killed her to have done that with me.  But oh well like she said she has her own family.  I guess that I'm not family. 

Oh well.  I guess that I should probably start on my laundry so I'll have some panties. Lol! :)"

"event","Halloween is fun.  I went to church yesterday morning.  My uncle preached on how if you're a christan you shouldn't participate in Halloween and made my aunt along with a few other people kinda feel bad.  Not me though.  Lol.  Halloween is fun.  Very fun.  

The mexican's had a HUGE party the other night.  They had balloons and stuff everywhere and decided they were gonna play their music until 6:30 in the morning.  They stood outside all night long and just yelled, laughed and did other stupid stuff.  I was so sleepy because I had to be at work at like 6 the morning before and I didn't go to bed until like 3.  So all I wanted to do was sleep.  I couldn't though.  Shame on the mexican's.  They had a permit to play their music as loud as they wanted and as long as they wanted.  I wanted to kill all of them.  I don't understand what their point was in all that mess.  So I can't wait until the one morning when I have to be at work at like 6.  I'm gonna go outside and just scream and yell and turn my music up.  But, because I'm not a mexican I'll end up getting yelled at by the po po.  Lol.  Oh well.  Ya can't win with them.  They'll come in to Walmart and it's like the all decide to come through my line.  They don't understand english and they have like 2 buggies with all their kids.  The mexicans cause chaos.  Lol

Okay me and my friend drive like 15 mins away from my house to the hill.  We get there and I was cool with everything.  We had talked about some funny stuff on the way there and I was in a fairly good mood.  He says, ""I'm gonna go ahead and turn the car off and we'll set here until it moves.""  I was the skeptic.  I didn't think this was real.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  Not 2 mins after he had turned the car off, we were sitting there and the car GOD AS MY WITNESS started going up the hill.  It was around 10 at night and it was foggy.  I was just tripping out.  I mean, I was in tears.  We went all the way up the hill with the car off.  He laughed at me the whole time cause he's done this 9000 times.  I didn't think it was too funny.  Especially when we went to eat and he said, ""Walk around to the back of the Jeep and tell me what you see.""  I walked around to the back and I saw hand prints and just about peed on myself.  That was by far the scariest thing that's ever happened to me.  

On the way home we had to go back over the hill and I made him drive really fast cause I was scared.  He stayed on the phone with me all night because I was scared.  How sad?  Lol.  I'm a big chicken.  But, wouldn't you be scared too?  

I just thought I'd let everyone know about my big experience.."

I feel like I'm missing out on so much stuff.  There isn't anything that ever happens there though, so I don't have too much to miss.  I miss Courtney more than anything in the world.  I never realized how close we were until I moved.  Sad times.  I haven't cried since I've been away from Harlan.  That's a plus.  I was so tired of crying it was unreal.  I just have to get use to everything.  I drove to Food Lion by myself today.  YAY.  That made me happy.  I'm going to a place called Gravity Hill tonight and I'm super scared.  I'm scared because my friend said that there was a boy who died there in a really bad car accident and now his mom's ghost haunts that hill and when you turn your car off and have it in park your car will go up the hill because his mom is trying to push you over the hill.  He's done it 20000 times and he says it isn't that bad.  I'm very bad scared.  We're going to a haunted plantation house soon too.  That makes me happy.  Yay for Halloween!  Only a month and 9 days until my 19th b-day!  Woo.  I guess that I'm done rambling for now."

"event","Today is my last day here.  Tonight is my last Harlan football game.  I don't really think it had all sank in until last night.  Tuesday night I had to tell my niece bye and it broke my heart.  We were both fine until she hugged me and said, ""I'm gonna miss you skank.."" We both lost it then.  I love Courtney.  She should've been my sister.  I'm gonna miss her more than anyone I think.  She just reminds me so much of me, except she's all sportsy and stuff.  I love her.  

Last night was so sad.  Jered made me cry.  I'm gonna miss all my friends so much.  I'm gonna miss Harlan in general.  I'm so scared.  I mean, Concord isn't much bigger than Harlan but I know Harlan.  It's just gonna be so different.  Ahh!  Lol.  I've cried all day.  I know tonight isn't gonna be much better.  It will be so sad.  I've got the car all packed down and stuff.  So, I really don't have that much more to do.

The more I think about leaving, the more sad I get.  So I'm gonna go to the game and go out to eat with some friends and hopefully I'll be okay, until it's time to go home.  Oh well.  I've got some more stuff to do today so I think that I'm gonna get my sad ass out of the house for a while.  I guess this may be the last entry for a while until I get settled in there.  Bye Harlan."

"event","First and foremost Mr.Fatass Landlord, I do not owe you 275.00 for this months rent considering I moved out on the 29th.  Next, I did not steal your mother's dishes.  I bought my own damn dishes at the dollar store.  

My ex-landlord is trying to say that I stole dishes and owe him rent because he's scared that I'm gonna sue his fat lazy ass.  Anyone who has been to my old apartment knows that my steps are terrible and it was his place to fix them.  I asked him to fix them at least 3 times, but ya know, he's not gonna do anything but sit on his lazy fat ass and yell at his kids.  Gosh I'm so mad.  I'm the one who got screwed out of the whole deal.  I mean, if I sued his stupid head then surely I'd win.  I dare him if I do decide to take him to court, what's he gonna do?  Does he have proof I stole the dishes?  HELL NO!  I didn't steal them anyways.  Why would I want his mother's dishes?  I have my own.  Some people are idiots.

I suppose that I should head up to Cranks Saturday and get my bedroom suite.  How wonderful will that be?  That's a hazard in itself.  I feel so sorry for whoever helps me.  

Anyways...Today on Dr.Phil they were talking about the Natalie girl that went missing on her senior trip.  I kinda have mixed feelings on that.  She was the one who on her own got in a car with 3 strange men.  I'm not saying that she deserved whatever happened, but if you're in Aruba why would you get in the car with 3 men you didn't know?  One of the boys who was involved in the whole thing said that she was drunk and she was dressed like a slut and acted like one.  Her mom went insane and said that her daughter was a virgin.  Well, I have news for her mother...All girls don't tell their mothers what they do.  What mother can honestly say that their daughter tells them everything about them?  I'd be scared to death to tell my mother that I wasn't a virgin.  Who knows what that girl was like?  I feel terrible for her family and who knows where the poor girl is.  Oh well.

Wow...I'm not in a good mood at all and I'm also being very random.  I think I'm getting sick because I can't stop sneezing to save my life.  I also get sent home early from work today because I suck at my job.  So..I don't know.  I hope tomorrow is better.  It should be.  Oh well though.

I guess I'm out!  :D"

"event","For the past few days all I've wanted to do is cry and eat.  It's like, I'll pack a box of clothes then I'll cry and eat a cookie for a minute.  What's wrong with me?  Lol.  I think I'm kinda sad about moving again.  I'm very scared that I'm gonna get all the way to North Carolina and not find friends like I have here.  How many people out there are like Megan or Brittany?  I'm also gonna miss Josh as bad as I hate to say it.  It's just kinda weird that for the past 3 years he's been there through everything then he's just gonna be gone.  I flipped out on him the other night and I kinda feel bad for it.  But I suppose he deserves it.  Anyways.  There are 25 million other people I'm gonna miss so much.  I just don't have time to name every single one of them, but I'm sure they know who they are.

It takes so much for me to listen to Wake Me Up When September Ends by Greenday.  That song is so sad.  I just want to cry everytime I listen to it.  Between that song, Coldplay, and John Mayer my week has been a sad one.  Lol.  

I quit school so I could get enough money to move.  I'm working 40 hours a week now talking to the most hateful people in America.  How wonderful?  1:30 til 9 is insane.  But for 8 dollars an hour I think I can take it.  

Uhm..Let's see.  OH YEAH!  My brother is super pissed about me moving.  Oh my gosh.  I get yelled at everyday about moving so far away.  Why does he and my sister think that they can tell me what to do?  I'm 18 damnit and the guardianship papers only were until November 17th 2004.  Lordy.  I know that I may be stupid and young but it's my life.  I sound like Bon Jovi.  :)

"event","I hate Harlan.  I'm so stupid for not moving to North Carolina when I was a junior.  Stupid feelings.  I had to move back in with my sister because I'm hurt.  I tore the tendon in my shoulder and that sucks.  For no reason like whatsoever I just cry.  I think it's because I'm so frustrated because I can't do anything.  Ah well.  

I have no idea what I want to do with my life, considering that my brother said that he'd buy me a car if I went to college.  Now that I'm going to college, I don't know what I want to do.  Honestly, being a nurse isn't what I want to do at all.  Teachers really don't make enough money.  So what else?  Lol.  This sucks!  Everyone is pushing me to make decisions right now.  What am I supposed to do?  Like, at this moment I think I just need time to figure out what I want to do with my life and where I want to go with it instead of having everyone push me again.  Moving to North Carolina probably wouldn't be a bad idea.  I could go there and work until next year then start in college AGAIN and try to figure out something to do for the rest of my life.

I'm such a whiner.  I hate being hurt because I can't eat.  I've lost 7 pounds since the fall down my stupid steps.  My fat ass landlord is an idiot.  They're the most retarded people I've ever been around in my life.  They so should live in a hollow in Evarts.  That may sound really mean, but these people are just idiots.  Gosh.  You'd have to know them I suppose.

The night before I had company and stuff and I didn't mind being there but last night I just couldn't stand hearing all those weird noises and tripping out.

I have to go to the grocery store today.  I have food stamps and I intend on making the most of them.  It's hard being all on your own.  I mean, I have to watch everything I spend now because I have bills I have to pay and that sucks ass.  That's the only part of being on my own that I really don't like.  Everyone talks about how hard it is and you're thinking that you can do it, but no It's the hardest thing ever.  I'm so broke right now.  It sucks.  

I really want KFC, but instead I'm going to go get chicken and stuff to fix at my house for me and Robin.  It'll be the first meal that I've made at my house.  Anyone who can find my house is more than welcome to come see me.  I don't like being alone, so I love company!  :D

"event","I decided I'd be sick today and not go to school.  I know, I'm such a bad student.  I just didn't feel like getting up super early and spending my day playing with a doll head.  My morning has consisted bathing, watching Mean Girls, going back to sleep, watching Little House, now I'm trying to figure out what's goin on on Days of our Lives.  I use to be so into that show.  But now, I hardly have time to watch it.  Ah well.  

Things have been going pretty good lately.  I'm taking things as they come and learning to deal with them.  Not rushing things have helped alot.  Things are just flowing right along now and I'm super happy with that.

I don't really have much to write about.  Nothing fun has happened in my life.  I still wanna go swimming really bad, but no one can go when I can.  It's okay though, I still have lots of time before summer is over.  

It's almost the 4th!  Woo woo! :)  I'm so excited because it's time for bbq.  Yes..Lol..I'm such a fat kid, but oh well.

I guess this is all."

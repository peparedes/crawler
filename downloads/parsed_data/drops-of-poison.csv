I mean any of you who know me as well as you do, know that I swear a lot...look at my entries, I RARELY EVER SWEAR!  This angers me to an unxplainable extent.

Well let me tell you about my day so far, in Video Broadcasting we started working on our ""Entertainment Broadcast""  oh yes, so long awaited.  SO for the intro, Kyle (editor) had the majority of the staff walk down Main Street...in a slow motion, macho style.  Hah I couldn't do it.  I mean I was thinking Reservior Dogs, they were thinking about some weird award winning movie, that gets ripped off often or something.  So anyway, NO ONE took it seriously, I mean hey...we are the Word staff. =D

I can not wait to see how it turned out, I bet it is great.  Tonight at Late Night...yay!  Haley and the ""Soap Opera"" crew are going to her house to film their little segment, AKA: The Sterotypical Soap Opera...oh yea, it shall be grand.

I am very tired....yes....very tired...couldn't sleep, too cold...

Well I have wasted enough of your oh so important time, and think I will leave you now, hell I might be back in third hour...Creative Writing, I own that one computer! =D

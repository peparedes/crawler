WHAT AM I GONNA DO??? *just get myself a rich boyfriend, get married, have kids, a fancy house, and all that crap.. the worst bit: will have to do all that timewastful (yes, people, I HAVE just invented that word!) cooking!!!*

The whole situation makes me sick. Mainly because everyone thinks she is my sister! *thanks God she's not!*
And my real sister is in Minsk, and I have no idea if she's ever going to come back to Voronezh... Neither I know when am I gonna get to see her..

I hate them. Those irresponsible careless adults (mainly man, but woman can be as bad), who marry, have sex, have babies, walk away with another woman (who in most cases is younger then their wives), get divorced, marry again, have sex, more babies and the story goes on and on and on. The thing is that they don't seem to give a shit!
And - guess who's got to suffer the most?!"

"event","So, today was fun. English Andrea was pretending she couldn't move her head or anything and I was just like yea whatever and listened to music. Second hour we were suppose to work on a paper but no one did it so we're probably going to fail and I just talked to Jordan (whom I can't stay mad at, you gotta love him)Then I went to Sociology and got a pretzel and hot chocolate (that Rick hoarded) and I almost fell asleep watching the stupid movie. Then I T.A.ed and I just wrote to Britt and indulged in music (it was amazing). Lunch was interesting, me and Rachel got burritos which were sooo good except mine got stuck in the bag and then exploded its self and Rachel was eating hers with a spoon and I just laughed at her. We made plans for lunch every day and it is going to be kick ass. Math was fun, just sat and talked to Trey and Tyler. Physics we took a quiz (which I bombed) Then I talked to Britt and came home and made the most amazing food and it was so cool.

When you call Rick's phone it shows up with a girl in a wheelchair dancing or something, it is so messed up. I love it.

I am really bored and in a hella good mood, so call me if you wanna hang out.

"event","Ok, So, I made the last entry friends only because I changed my mind on some things in there and I don't need them being read. I REALLY changed my mind. OK, so this weekend we really boring. Saturday I had to stay home and chill with Anya and what not but I went to Barros and said hi to Rick so I got my social interactment of the day. I really was in the I-want-a-boyfriend kind of mood and I just talking to like a million people. At 3 in the morning I got up and I just had this really strong feeling of ""I have to change my profile"" I have no idea why and in the morning I had to see what I put in there and it was cool but I changed a few things, I am quite the poet at 3 in the morning. Today was cool, I got up and sat around the pool and what not for a while and it was fun and then I went and picked up Britt from work and saw Kevin and it was all great fun. Then we went to her house and I put my pants on inside out... They are so much more comfortable. I tried a backhandspring which turned out fine except for the rug burns on my knees, then we feed her dog mass amounts of turkey because she had no other food (this is all while we are waiting for her mom to call.) Then we found this crazy toy that you have to beat up and it says stuff (what is it trying to teach children?) Then we realized it was the Beast in Beauty and the Beast and it was so much fun, We also listened to music and talked about shoes (odd to say) Her mom still hadn't called so we decided to go visit her at Safeway. We attempted to buy condoms and a pregnacy test but she just laughed at us. Then we went to my house and mom got me a bracelet and a cooll bely button ring. Then we decided to go to Jordan's for ""band practice"" but it was excessively boring and we just sat and texted each other. Then we went and tried to get me new shoes (because I love Britt's) but Mom won't let me get any money. Grrrr. So we went and got a little pizza and she ate half of it and I dropped her off and then I ate the other half. The whole time we were listening to Bright Eyes and talking about STUPID people. So I am going to wear Britt's shoes tomorrow (maybe). I have just been hanging around here eating random things, which reminds me, of all of your five sences, if you had to, would you give up? It was long discussed and me and Brittany way agree on the same one. I just talked to Britt on the phone and now I'm excited, she is goig to give my number to at LEAST 5 emo guys at the Bright Eyes concert. (YES). We also talked about somethings and I vented because I was way mad but I got over it. She so backs me up in everything I do, I love that girl. Anyways, Anya is driving me up the way because she always steals all my stuff and it REALLY is making me mad, I have thrown away so much make up, she has eatin so much of my food and now she has taken my flippin keys. I am going to murder that little girl. I get my hair died again on Tuesday (oh yea) and I am excited, it will be cool. I don;t feel like writing anymore.

"event","Last night I went to Harolds to hang out with Nay and Melissa. They introduced me to this guy (Kyle) and then Jill's mom (the manager) asked if I wanted a job and she gave me an application. So now I'm most likely going to work at Harolds. It was a fun 45 minutes. Some guys offered Nay $100 for her shirt but she wouldn't do it, even though she had a shirt on underneath it. Anyways, Nay wants me to go hang out with her and Melissa at a party but I think my dad has graveyard shift and mom and Andrew are gone so I have to watch the kids. Sounds fun huh? Maybe I'll see if Britt can spend the night or something. My dads keeps saying the superbowl party this the superbowl party that and finally I asked what the hell superbowl party was going on. There isn't one but it is just an excuse for my dad to buy mass amounts of food. We probably won't even watch the game. I might but they probably won't. So basically I gat mass amounts of ice cream sandwhichs. So yea, call me if your bored, maybe we can do something BEFORE I have to babysit.

"event","Interesting day, left school and had to go to the hospital. Turns out I am allergic to Sulfa or something and I have really bad hives, which only occur when I am hot. So I have to be constantly cold in order to not have an itching convulsion. So, I have to stay away from ""Sulfa"" and take oatmeal baths in cold water (the worst thing ever) I guess it will be bad for like the next 3 days. Then I went to the varsity game and snuck in and didn't get caught until the 2nd half. I got kicked out and had to come home and be bored. Oh well. I am freezeing and I itch and it really sucks. LOL, funny story, the doctor had to take a throat swab or something but he didnt tell me and proceeded to stick a giant q-tip down my throat which made me gag like hell and it was horrible. So, I am dying and I'm cold and I should probably take another frozen oatmeal bath but I think I'll cuddle up in my bed with a million blankets and hope the gallon of cortaid, clartin and benadryl will keep me from itching. I have the weirdest problems. Which by the way, I am NOT contagious at all. So give me a call and keep me company.

I am bored and I have to drive around for my parents but I am going to listen to Finch the whole time. So, anyways, call me if you want to hang out or something today, I can do anything until 6. (very purpleish) So call me .

"event","So I applied for a job today and I am going to go do some more tomorrow. It makes me happy actually and I really want one. I want to work at Barro's because you can work your ass off. We'll see. So I just got back from Britts and we swapped some cds and it was beautiful. So many people have my cds, it is almost hard to keep track of. Ummm, update on my life. School is going good. I actually have good grades because I kind of had an epihany of some sort. I can't write about my home life because certian people would read it and that would be no good because I would get yelled at.  Love life is absent, kinda self imposed because I just need to worry about work for the moment. I have a guy I like and thats kind of cool but I am not going to act on it or anything. Not in that mind set. I get to go to Idaho for my cousin, Hannah's birthday party. That will be fun because it will be a whole bunch of little kids that I get to put make-up on and do their hair. (It's a princess party.) The best part is it is a suprise and I love doing that. So, now I am bored. Hummmm. Ok well I shall go and burn some more cds.

April 2nd, The Used, My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail and A Static Lullaby are all going to be here, plus more but those are all I care about. Holy Shit. I am going to go. That one is going to be amazing. Anyways, Brittany was sick today so I had to work AGAIN and I got in a big fight with mom in the middle of church about my car. (I never pay any attention, guess I am going to hell) So there was this guy that was blind and he was singing and playing the piano and the whole time Andrew thought he was retarded and it was very funny expecaially sence he SAID he was blind right in the beginning. Work was boring but I made this crazy ass necklace that is so cool. So now I am at home because I still don't feel to hot. So I just found out I have soccer pictures tomorrow. That will be fun. So yea, call if you want.

"event","Indiscribable day. It felt like it lasted a million years. I so didn't want to get up today like, I was seriously on the verge of tears. I had a dream that I found Russia (man I miss her so much) and that I was going out with Sean, Jordan and some other kid all at the same time. So then in english today, Grant sat with me (sigh). he is going to bring me a cd on monday because supposidly I HAVE to hear it. He plays some instrument (sigh). Anyways, History was beyond boring as was sociology but me and Rick had some MIGHTY interesting conversations. My TA hour sucked and I almost fell asleep at lunch (who does that) and then I DID sleep through math. Physics we had a test and Andrea got REALLY pissed when I told her how her answer was wrong. (She thought 5.9 ment 5 days and 9 hours and then I got Riesner to tell her it was just 5.9 days and she got mighty pissed. Thanks to me she actually passed the test. Then I came home and found some nice comments in my live journal from Sean and so I sent him a nice little comment back and we fought for a while and I was really hurt and REALLY mad but then I fell asleep and I woke up and I had a message from him on my phone and it made me feel bad so I kinda said sorry, I mean here is no reason to fight, he's a cool kid and I ruined our relationship completely and thats totally my fault and I admit it. It just made me mad that I had apologized completely and he said we were cool and then was kind of a hypocrite. I just forgive people really easily, like I'll fight like hell but then I'll either say sorry or forgive them or whatever. I really don't like fighting and this one just took me out of left field. Then I went to Desert Ridge and I walked right by him, I did a double take and it just really blew me out of the water because that was the first time I had even seen him since we broke up. Big mixture of feelings on that one. LOL. I just wish we were really cool. I don't know, lately I am really big on the guy friend thing. Guys make the best friends. So yea, then I hung out with Will and we walked around and went to Islands and it was good, fun, you know. (getting burned out on typeing) But I saw Britt there and she was unbeliveably wired, I have never seen her that wired. Probably because she had Conor. ha ha. I reminded Grant to bring me Perfect Circle or whatever, he likes good music so it must be good. So now I am home and I am really tired again, (yawning as I type) I have a lot of people to talk to later so I can't sleep yet. I have work all day tomorrow. I never get to sleep in anymore. I just got off the phone with Britt and she made a statement that was really true, things are getting way to serious. We are constantly stressing out. I blame it on guys and parents, the two greatest evils ever. I am so sick of stressing out, I am actually not really anymore, like I get these random waves of happiness (I only say this because I just had one) and like I get really excited for all the things to come and just anything could happen with anyone and it makes me feel really good and it gives me a rush. Call me crazy. (yawn) Sp yea, I am really in to Last Prophets and Rise Against right now. I am SOOO EXCITED FOR THE SHOW. I really can't wait like I CRAVE it. I want it so bad. I can only go if someone goes with me and the only one that looks like they are going too is Jordan and I can't really go with him if he takes his girlfriend but I REALLY want to go. I have to. I bought a CD today, I think I bought the wrong one but we'll see. So I am going to upload that and then maybe watch Donnie Darko or take a cat nap before I get bombarded with phone calls and what not. (yawn) So, I love you all.

Sounds vaguely familiar. I just want a guy that won't cheat on me or fight just let me put my trust in them completely. I don't want to have to worry all the time. Just simple, no lies just love. :)

"event","I am completely not grounded and I seriously doubt I'll be grounded again anytime soon. So a lot of fun stuff has happened lately and I don't even know where to start. I got my phone back today and I had 6 voicemails, some were from my dad which is really funny because he is the one that toook my phone away. Some times I just don't get them. I kinda started to miss Darren today, it was unfair to say he was like Jordan it is more correct to say I felt like I could like him as much as I did Jordan, more so even. I feel really bad because I never really got to be real. I was crazy fr a while. I did some bad stuff that only a few people know about. (Britt, Sean and Jordan.) I fought Jordan though and now I have a big dent in the side of my car where we think I got thrown in to it but I am not so sure. I kinda snapped out of my emo depression on sunday I think. I built a little bon fire in my back yard and it made me better I swear. So I feel bad that I wasn't realish with Darren and I kinda wish I could try again but no use wishin on something that won't come true. I am pretty good right now. I don't have any crazy disires to do what I was doing (have no fear). So that was kinda my apology to Darren but it made me mad how he just suddenly turned on me. I want a boyfriend that I won't fight with and I can completely trust and just know he will be there for me when I fall off the face of the earth in one of my parents forced depressions (which are over now thank god) I don't wanna fight about stupid shit. I don't wanna fight at all. Like Britt but a guy. She is the bestest friend ever by the way. I have never fought with her. Anyways, I am very hungry and forgot all the crap I wanted to write about. Salem is sitting on my sholder and it is kinda annoying. Call me because now you CAN!!!!!

"event","Wow, so it has been a long time. I only really do this when I am single. So thus I am writing again. haha.  Darren (very rudely) broke up with me today which doesn't really suprise me but the way he did it shocked me because I didn't think he was the asshole I guess he is. Oh well I didn't take it hard, didn't really hurt, it was actually welcomed. I only held on to him for two reasons, one he was pretty damn cute and two he was a lot like Jordan and I thought maybe he could make me feel the same way Jordan did. Yea, didn't happen. Not bya  long shot. I was talking to Britt and Rick today, they both crack me up. I just decided I need an emo kid, they are the best things in the world. I am grounded right now unitl Wednesday I think. Not really a problem, I needed a weekend to myself to sleep in and chill. I was thinking a lot about Sean today for some reason, there is so much he just doesn't know and I know he thinks I am a bitch and a liar (which isn't completely not true) I just kinda wanna explain what a crazy time I have had lately. Only Jordan and Britt know about the bad stuff. So I am going to go to some concerts and find some hardcore emo kids because thats what I need. I think some how (with the help of Britt) I have seen the light and realize that when it comes to guys, It is emo or bust. I am not allowed to be on right now but I am doing an ""english project"" so I guess it is allowed. Lets see, new things in my life. I have really really dark hair now and it is crazy but I like it. It also has really cool redish streaks in it. It makes my eyes look crazy cool (expecially when I cry).

So, I want an emo kid with the emo hair and plays either the drums or the guitar and is in a band (because that is way hot) I want him to pay attention to me and love me to death. I am not picky. Thats all I need.

Febuary 7th-- Alexisonfire, Rise Against and Tsunami Bombs
Febuary 10th-- Bright Eyes
April 2nd-- The Used, My Chemical Romance and others. 

Thats my plans. 

I need this in writing.

I (Kaytlin Holding) do swear on everything that I will never cheat or lie to another boyfriend. I will never hold back and I will give all I have. This I promise. 

YAY. Ok I am done. I will try to be back on later tonight but we'll see, If I am not I couldn't get past my dad. Give me comments, they make me happy.

Muah... Kaytlin"

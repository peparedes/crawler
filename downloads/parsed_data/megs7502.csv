"event","ok so i haven't written in here in for-ev-er!!  so much has happened!!  my life has changed so much and i'm absolutely loving it.  

ok so first, school's great, but all of their little rules are starting to get on my nerves!!  i cannot stand them!!  they are so stupid!  anywho, i think my classes are going smoothly.  i'm enjoying them.  

work(s) are fine.  i love both my jobs!!  i've gotten a promotion at chick-fil-a twice.  first i took victoria's place which is a HUGE deal!!  and now i'm moving up to be a Unit Training Coordinator (UTC).  i'm excited.  

boys...oh goodness where to start?

well jeff is still being jeff and not understanding that i'm not in love him anymore b/c he's changed so much.  i just don't understand him i guess.  he just doesn't seem like his in love with me, but then again he seems like he does love me.  it's just a huge confusing mess!!  i love him to death, i just don't think we're meant to be together like that, anymore.  

and i so have the biggest crush on kyle!!  he's awesome!!  he just reminds me of what i've always wanted in a guy.  he's smart, funny, adorable!!, and he is just so loving.  he just has the biggest heart of anyone i know.  i wish i knew if he would ever go for a gal like me.  but i guess i'm going to have to wait and see what happens between us in the next couple of months.  lots can still happen!!

ok well i know that's not a lot considering the time i've missed writing in my journal, but that's all i got...what can i say i'm boring i guess.  ok well i have some homework to do so i guess i'll write in here again later!!  bunches, megs"

ok so i went to the movies the other night totally awesome.  i had so much fun.  we went and saw ocean's 12 it was great just don't go to the movie thinking it's going to be better than the first b/c duh that's the rule!  but i enjoyed myself and the movie.  and oh yes he's soooo H-O-T...HOT!

ok so...lol you like how i start every paragraph with ""ok so""...anywho, the whole jeff thing is still interesting i haven't really thought about any of it.  i'm just happy where i am and i don't really want to change that right now so there it is my life in a nut shell...NOTHING!...lol.  ok well i'm off, bunches, megs"

so how was your day?  have you talked to doug today?  i really wanna know what's going on there...you obviously seem to have something why don't you talk to him about it?  and how's your new job going, i've been meaning to ask you?  i miss you buddy let's go christmas shopping!!  i only have 7 days of classes and exams left...yay!!  i really want to  tell you i'm happy for you buddy and i'm glad you're the person you are.  i think you're awesome!!  (and i'm not trying to kiss up, i mean it) you rock my world!!  don't be mad it's okay!!  have a great night!!  love you!!  megs"

everyone at chick-fil-a thinks that me and kyle have this big undercover thing going on.  UMMMMM NO we don't!!!  we just like hanging out with each other.  so i wish people would just stop!!

still havent talked to jeff...lol.

"event","WOW!!!!  so this week has been sooooo interesting.  i bought a car, it's so pretty!!  it's a black 2001 hyundai santa fe.  it's loaded!!  leather interior, cd player, cruise control, split shift, and omg it's just great!!  i love it!!  his name is sebastian.  poor poor shawneequa i still love her she's sitting in the driveway...big shout out to her!!  

chris is starting to irritate me a little.  it's like he knows what buttons to push and pushes them anyways.  this entire past week i've been just shoved to the side.  i'm on the back burner has he once called it when i did this exact same thing to him.  it really just bothers me when people tell you they're going to do something and don't follow through...it's just annoying.  

it's okay to be who you want to be just don't get too many situations as i have going on.  but then again i have everything figured out.  it's difficult not knowing what to do and i pray for you every night buddy...i know that sounds kind of weird but i seriously do.  i only want the best for you.  i know where you end up *wink* i just hope you figure it out.  

kyle's been absolutely amazing!!  we talked for hours tonight!!  he so great.  he is just so down to earth, very intelligent, and simply hilarious.  he's everything i've ever wanted in a guy.  i feel myself holding back for some reason and i don't want too.  i just wanna be like kyle you're just awesome.  he makes these remarks that just make a girl think and uuggghhhh he's just grand!  

still haven't talked to jeff in forever!!  i was supposes to see him monday night, but like i said earlier i don't like it when people say they're going to do something and don't do it...anywho he was supposes to call chick-fil-a at 9 and did he?  NO!!  so needless to say i left when i got off work and i don't know what he's been doing.  it's so difficult b/c i love him i just don't think i'm IN love with him any more.  

love is a word that just seems to be thrown around too easily now and days.  i want to be so in love with someone that it doesn't matter how much money or material things we have.  as long as we have one another i'm happy.  i don't care about all that other stuff.  i just want to be happy in what i do have in life that i worked for to make a success.  

i don't want to wish my life away, but i just wish that i could get on with it.  i want to fast forward 5 years and know who i'm going to marry and have my career and start a family.  i simply want to be settled and be in a stable part of my life.  it feels like it's taking forever to get to that point.  

okay well i have a huge butt spanish test to study for and yes it's 12:14 AM!!  and the class is at...yes 9:30 AM!!  i'm screwed.  oh well.  at least it's almost friday!  bunches of love, megs

P.S.:  i really hate just talking about boys in my journals, but it seems to be the main issue, i'll try to stay away from the whole boy topic next time!!...lol."

haven't talked to jeff in a week.  it's strange but i'm getting used to it.  (ya know not being with him).  i kinda feel weird in a good and bad way both.  i don't know.  it's just complicated.  

saw kyle tonight, his as hot as ever.  i really wish he would just ask for my number i'm too chicken to give it to him.  oh well we'll see tomorrow night.

"event","well i'm balling my eyes out right now over the stupidest thing in the entire world.  ok so in chapel they have like 6 people who stand at the columns and take down names of people who sleep, talk, or aren't paying attention during the service don't get their chapel credit whether they come or not.  well the guy that stands on my column takes down at least 10 names every chapel service and i guess he decided he was going to take mine down.  so i go check my mail--yeah there's some papers, mail, and a letter saying i didn't get chapel credit for monday november the 8th b/c i was either sleeping, talking, or not paying attention.  well that's b.s.!!!  b/c i know i paid attention and i couldn't of been sleeping if i was paying attention b/c the entire service was on BSU's missionaries that went overseas this summer.  and i find all of that really interesting so i enjoyed the service very much more than any of the others.  but NO! i wasn't paying attention b/c some butthole thinks he has to take down names so that he can keep being the dork that stands up during chapel writing down names so that people like me can hate him.  and don't think i won't say something to him tomorrow in spanish b/c yes he is in there.  and now i have to make an appointment with the director of chapel to explain to him why i deserve my chapel credit.  i have enough stress on me to last a life time and now i have to put up with this mess.  not to mention that george is here and that always makes things 100 times worse.  and school, boys, and work all have me upset and really stressed out.  well i'm done now...and i'm hungry so i'll talk to you guys later.  bunches, megs"

ok buddy so you're giving me this massive load of information in your journal and not to me but that's ok here's what i have to say about it...
i love you. (period) and i really don't know what to think, say, or do about it.  i always have and always will.  i don't know if it's more than a friend love or what, but it's definitly on my mind.  ok and so we're going straight now or are you still undecided?  i'm really confused can you tell.  but i do have everything figured out.  

to kyle:
life's full of chances and choices to make...i say take 'em and make 'em.  life's too short to be worrying about the past, just move on and go for whatever falls into your lap at the moment and if it doesn't work out...who really cares?  move on again.  i had fun staying after work tonight and i saw a different side to you...you were kind of nervous and it was cute.  and i'm really excited about tomorrow, going to the movies, it's going to be great!!

to jeff:
i don't really know what to think about our situation.  i mean i love you to death, we've been through so much and you've done so much for me.  i've learned a lot from you and it seems like we're meant to be, but maybe not meant to be right now.  you put me out in the field again and now i'm wanting to see new people and see what happens.  i'm sorry if this hurts you, but you put me through a lot in the past few months and now that i've gotten the ""hang"" of it, you up and decide you want me back.  it's not that easy.  just give me time and we'll see what comes our way.

to myself:
be strong, think fast on your feet, encourage others, and love...always love.  never let a day go by that you've regretted...live that day to it's full potential and strive to meet all of your goals.  and most of all good luck!

to chick-fil-a:
keep your mouths shut!!  everyone don't need to know.  (about everything, not just kyle.)  

to others:
(read ""to myself"")

ok guys well i guess it's time for me to go write my speech, since it's due tomorrow and i have to present it at 11 am.  wish me luck.  and good night.  bunches of love, megs"

"event","yeah so i HAVE figured everything out...at least i hope i have.  and don't give me that crap about you've had everything figured out since the beginning of the summer, if you have then you're struggling getting it across to other people about what it is.  and what's this about you saying you throw me off course??  i don't get it.  but i have got it all figured out and you will all see shortly...hopefully if it plays out right.  (HINT:  i've had a lot of new signs that i think are pointing me in the right direction, but we'll have to see?!?!?!?)

so i don't think i'm going to get to go on my date friday unless it's extreme late.  they scheduled us to work b/c too many other people asked off.  so i work till 9...kyle till 10...chris till 6...tramaine is off...and sarah i'm not sure about.  but we still have to work so it sucks. maybe there'll be a late showing of the movie.

haven't talked to jeff in a while, but he did call me briefly to ask me to come over...what did i say??  NO!!!  and then he wanted to go to my culture event with me, but i took christofur instead he seemed more interested.  

oh and school's going well except for the fat ""F"" i got in u.s. history, but i think i can bring it back up so i'm not too worried about it.

it's been two years since dad's passed away (last thursday) and mom took it rather better than expected so i'm extremely proud of her.  it's not getting easier, it's just she's taking it a little better with time.

sorry for being so jumpy in this journal with my many events, but you guys get it.

well it's time for me to head back to the hills, plus i need to go run so i'm going to do that too. 

P.S.  what's with the ""read in to that more b/c it means so much on different levels and has different meanings""...don't get you sometimes buddy...but i still love you!

"event","ok so today at work was interesting...i had a few convos with the co-workers and they all seemed to be catching on to me liking kyle and kyle liking me.  jason told me he was going to get the dirt from kyle and find out what's really going through kyle's head.  i really don't want anything to be said about it at work but i know that's not going to happen.  i mean this is chick-fil-a we're talking about now.

yesterday me and chris went to the football game and guess who we saw...matt crain...ummm yes hot hot boy!!  got those digits and hopefully we'll be seeing each other real soon.  i think i made buddy mad though.  i didn't mean too.  i just assumed that nothing was happening any more b/c nothing else has been said.  i'm sorry if i made you mad or whatever you we're feeling since you never told me.  love you!!

but i'm extremely tired b/c chris kept me up until 5 a.m. this morning!!  and i so had to be at work at 11 until close!!  i dragged the whole day, but that's ok i got through it.  but i have to rest up for bowling tomorrow!!  night night.  bunches, megs"

"event","waiting is so frustrating....it just makes me wonder.  ya know?  it's like sometimes i don't know b/c of some actions or comments made by a certain person.  (you know who you are).  and it's just seems like the scale is balanced but it shouldn't be...one or the other way is the only way to go.  i just have this feeling and i don't really know how to describe it.  but it will fall into place if it's supposes too.  b/c i'm in no mood to rush things, i just don't want anything to be like last time...comprende?

so i'm really excited about my date next friday with the chick-fil-a crew.  we're going to see some scary movie.  and i'm kind of fond of this one guy and i hope things--do something.  and i wouldn't call this my rebound from jeff...b/c i hate calling it a rebound.  in order to get over someone you have to move on to someone else...and you never ever date anyone that you don't think you could see yourself marrying...right?  right.  

talk about signs...let me just tell you what just happened to me.  so i was on my way home from ngc and i got to thinking (funny ha ha)...lol.  anywho i was thinking about a lot of stuff at once like i normally do and i usually get ahead of myself that's why none of my journal entries ever make any sense...but i was thinking about updating my journal, my mission trip two years ago, olive juice :), and that the subject of the journal entry is key to everything...lol...i crack myself up.  but anywho the sign was that when i thought of olive juice i looked over and out of the corner of my eye i saw a sign that said olive branch on it.  i was like ""wow"" so is that a sign?  maybe not i don't know, but it just seemed weird that it happened at the moment i was thinking about it.  

but i have to go get ready now i'm going to the big homecoming football game tonight!!  what what!!  love you all, megs"

"event","so guys it's been a while.  well i actually don't remember how long ago since i last wrote in here but i'm doing it now!!  hee hee.  anywho, how are things going with you?  me...i'm great.  things are interesting as usual and i love it.  it's so fun being _______ (i don't even know a word for it).  but life's good and tiring...which i guess is a good thing.  

i've been trying to figure something out and i can't seem to put my finger on what to do about it.  it's so complicated...which i don't think it should be and i'm not really thinking too much on it, it's just weird.  (hint: cabrera)

inside joke~  saved!~  the girl (in the cinema) is trying to do something that i think someone was hinting at that i might be doing...but i'm not.  you can do whatever you want to buddy...it's your life and i have no say in it...i'm just the friend here to give the advice.  love you!

jeffro is being weird again.  love him to death don't know what i would do without him...but he just confuses me all the time.  i don't think it's very healthy, but it's amusing.  lol.  we're going to columbia tomorrow and that should over well...i hope.  it's been a while since we've been on a long road trip together so i don't know what to expect.  

well guys my last thought for today is a few quotes~  you must first put up the rain in order to see the rainbow  ~~  love is not to love a perfect person, but love is to love an imperfect person perfectly."

"event","ok so have you ever been so confused that you think something happened that didn't happen, but really did actually happen.  confused?  exactly.  i don't get it with this special someone who doesn't seem to even know his own name if someone didn't say it to him everyday.  i'm a little pissed and i don't really know why b/c i know that nothing could ever happen between me and this person b/c he has completely lost my respect due to his inconsiderate judgment calls.  and don't take this personal buddy...i'm not really mad i guess i'm just venting.  so don't get mad at me and not talk to me for five months...lol!!  i'm not mad at you...i just understand and i'm expressing my opinion.  but i love you sooo much, but you just seem to not know what's going on in your own life, yet you seem to know how to make all of the right choices in life, but you turn and run away from them.  i don't understand and i guess i never will b/c you never gave it the chance.  i love you and i hope you understand that and just don't be mad at me b/c i don't think i could really bare that right now and neither can you.  so be happy and live your life the way you want too.  bunches of love forever, megan

i'm also feeling a little stressed with the whole jeff situation...when am i not?  but i haven't talked to him since sunday and i really don't want to...it's just seems weird i guess.

i joined a bowling team...we're called the wow cows!!  (it's with chick-fil-a) and it's me, sarah v., and bobby.  we all have a grand ole time and it's just hilarious.  i got a turkey (three strikes in a row) on my first game, but that didn't really help us any b/c we were playing for our handicap so actually we needed to bowl as low as possible...which didn't help us at all....

well me and candace went to wal-mart and ingles from ngc...all in an hour and a half....impressive....no?  lol...anywho, yeah and i saw jeff's truck at the village like always...it made me miss him even more than i already was at that moment.  

christofur isn't talking to me about much right now...he says he has something to say but he won't tell me what it is...and he still has my cds!!  i'm 'bout to come after you boy!  lol...well i'm a little upset right now after my spill so i think i'm going to get in the bed...night guys!  bunches of love, megs"

(scared me to death!) and i said ""what...good lord!"" and he said ""start that song over"" (b/c i was listening to one of my new cd's) and it was the song he wanted me to hear!!  (awwwwww!!!) so i thought it was the sweetest thing...so i've been talking about it a lot sorry guys!  but he hasn't done something like that for me in a long time so i am excited!  

my new buddy candace has live journal as well!!  isn't that fun?  so i have to go read hers in a minute!

i've been working like a dog the past two weeks...i've worked a total of 55 hours! i have never worked so much in my whole life!!  but a fat paycheck is coming!

christofur the journal entries....really? is that necessary?  i have no clue what you are talking about half the time i bet you don't even know what you're talking about.  and i'm about to kill you with the whole ""no, yes, no, yes, no"" thing...you know what it is don't play dumb!

"event","have you ever been so in love with someone that you think it's better for you to be apart?  i know it sounds weird, but in order for me to make mine and jeff's relationship stronger i think we need serious time apart.  i'm so in love with him and he just doesn't seem to care any more.  i know he does, it's just the way he has been acting that has gotten me down about the whole situation.  i wish he would just fall in love with me all over again and we could just start over.  i can't even begin to tell you how horrible it feels to be so deeply in love with someone and not being able to be with them.  megs"

I've been going out on little photo expeditions to seek out and find cool stuff to photograph.  This weekend I went down to Olympia to attend my friend Tyler's birthday party.  On the way down I took a side trip into Tacoma.  After unwillingly breathing in the Tacoma Aroma and trying in vain to reach my friend <lj user=""illgoest""> I headed over to the Museum of Glass.  This has got to be one of the coolest structures ever, it just begs to be photographed.  I must have taken well over 75 photos of it from all different angles.

Anyway random thoughts:

It's weird walking through Whole Foods and being able to sing along to <b>The Killers - Mr Brightside</b> being pumped over the stores soundsystem.  Alt-Rock, invading hip grocery stores everywhere.

It's funny around here because you can drive with your cars top off one day that it's nice and sunny and it will be pouring down rain the next day.

The product I'm working on takes a long time to install, almost 45 min.  Good thing I only have to do it every other day or so.

I went to a party and everyone was speaking French...it's cool to know another language.  I suck cause I only know English. :P

UPS has lame hours...they always deliver my packages when I'm at work...it's hard to find the Redmond Shipping Center hours on their website...the center is only open 10:30-6, Monday through Friday.  Which happen to be the exact hours that I'm usually working.  Why not be open 12-5 on Saturday so people who work during the week can pick up their packages?

I still love the <b>Menomena!</b> CD....they opened for the Gang of Four at the Showbox the other day and I missed it.  <b>LAME!</b>

Photoshop CS2 makes it easy to fix things now that they have individual layer histories.  <b>YAY!</b>

I've never been able to play a full game of Texas Hold-Em on my cellphone, something more interesting always happens and causes me to close my phone.

Saw The Interpeter on Saturday...Nicole Kidman is hot!!

I really should take that Math Test to get into the <a href=""http://seattlecentral.edu/proftech/PROphoto.php"">Commercial Photography Program</a> at SCCC.  I've put it off for like a year already.

Well thats all for now folks...look for another post in 6 months or so.

"event","It's amusing contrasting the wide variety of electoral vote maps through the different web pages.  Watching Washington, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and especially Ohio swing back and forth between Bush & Kerry is mildly amusing and downright scary at times.

Once again though, the key state for either party seems to be New Hampshire which in 2000 gave Nader 4% of the votes, Bush took the state 48% to Gore's 47% (a separation of a mere 7282 votes).  

Here are the three Electoral Vote counters I've been watching:

The one by a Professor at Princeton, he takes all the polls and feeds them into a little Java App:
http://synapse.princeton.edu/~sam/pollcalc.html

This one which I find pretty liberally bias, yet it's the quite extensively detailed:
http://electoral-vote.com/

And this one which I would have though would have been the most liberal but seems fairly balanced:
http://slate.msn.com/id/2107683/

One thing for sure it's going to be a close race."

"event","No one seems to have seized on Kerry's assertion that Bush is a small business because he owns a timber company.

It's still early but doing a Google News search is pretty much a dead end with a simple ""Bush timber company"" search.  I had to dig for it but the correct search is ""Annenberg timber bush""

The remark Kerry made is in fact true:
The Annenberg analysis said Bush qualifies under that definition because he reported $84 in income from his part-ownership of a timber enterprise on his 2001 federal tax return. (<a href=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/federal/20041009-0003-debate-factcheck.html"">Source</a>)

Also:
Kerry startled Bush by saying that the president is counted as a small business for tax purposes because he once earned $84 from a timber company he owns.

""I own a timber company?"" Bush asked. ""That's news to me."" Then he paused and added, ""Need some wood?""
That baffling exchange arises from an analysis by the Annenberg Public Policy Center's FactCheck.org debunking 

Bush's claims that Kerry's plans to raise taxes on the richest Americans would increase the tax burden on 900,000 small businesses. <b>The analysis found that the Bush campaign is counting every rich person who has even $1 of outside business income as a small business owner, even if they have no employees.</b> The analysis said even Bush qualifies under that definition because <b>he reported $84 in income from his part-ownership of a timber enterprise on his 2001 federal tax return</b>. (<a href=""http://www.newshounds.us/2004/10/09/factchecking_on_foxnewscom.php"">Source</a>)

Does this mean Bush is cheating on his taxes?  

Is Bush exploiting a huge loophole in the tax code he created?

Or is Bush just distorting Kerry's numbers as usual?

Either way Bush's ""I own a timber company?  That's news to me."" comments should come back to haunt him if the story goes anywhere.  

C'mon press, do your job and dig a little deeper into this. ;)"

Francis Crick was a great man who received endless happiness from his life, his work, and his accomplishments.  I will miss him greatly.

On a side note:
I'm probably being silly about this but I've taken the liberty of making a lot of my personal stuff in my LJ friends only for awhile.  There's going to be some publicity surrounding his death and I'd rather not have my name/life/reflections turn up on while someone somewhere is searching for my grandfather on Google and strays off the beaten path.

"event","<b>The ""Ban Gay Marriage"" amendment has failed miserably</b> in the Senate and will not even make it to the floor for a vote.

The GOP managed to only get 48 of the 60 they needed to get the amendment to the Senate floor.  Sen. John McCain not only broke from the GOP position to take a stand against the amendment he also provided some fantastic quotes.  Based on the actions of past four years it still amazes me why anyone would have voted for W. over McCain in the 2000 primaries.

Here is the CNN article about the amendments <a href=""http://cnn.allpolitics.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=CNN.com - Same-sex marriage amendment fails in Senate - Jul 14, 2004&expire=-1&urlID=11003423&fb=Y&url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/14/samesex.marriage/index.html&partnerID=2001"">grand failure</a>."

"event","Well I hung out with the Americans last night, we went to a bar, drank a little, and headed back to the Hostel.  We all agreed that the Hotel was incredibly dull, so we eneded up watching Class of 1999 (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0099277) on the Euro 4 channel with Dutch subtitles.  It was basically The Warriors meets Pump Up the Volume with a little bit of Terminator thrown in for good measure.  A lot of it seemed to be a portrayl of what the future would be like after the Crack-Cocaine epedmic that swept through LA in the 80's.  The drug was different in name but it was a thinly disguised analogy.

Today I hopped on the Metro (subway) and headed to this fine Net Cafe where I am killin gtime.  My plane does not leave till 4:55pm, I don't have to be there till 2:55, so I figured I'd write some more about my trip.

It's hard to belive it's winding down already, I have 8 days left in which to explore England.  I will be in London from the 3rd to the 6th, then up to Cambridge, then down south of London somewhere to visit my Aunt and Uncle.  I will only be visiting with them  for one night due to scheduling conflicts, my flight leaves at 9am Wednesday morning.  Should be interesting going through American customs.  British customs was a breeze, show your passport, tell them how long are you staying and which part, and then thery stamp your passport and off you go.  

Well Rotterdam is somewhat different fashion wise from the rest of Europe.  I saw a lot of girls wearing stone washed jeans that were bright neon in color.  Several were wearing neon green, another one was wearing day-glo orange.  The 80's are back!!  Also Abba's Greatest Hit's Remastered was Number 15 on the top 25 bestsellers at a music store I went to.  Of course pin-stripes slacks and tops are all the craze in Europe, which I like a lot, I think females look very attractive in pin-stripes.    

Crossing the street in Europe is strange, in French they just jaywalk like there's no tomorrow, the Germans on the other hand are very polite and insist on waiting for the green walk light to go.  Netherlands is a mix of both, but they tend to only cross just before the light goes green.  Here in Rotterdam you have to watch out even if you have a green light because a mad cyclist will come out of nowhere and ring thier little bell at you so you get the hell out of thier way.  Almost been run over several times here in Rotterdam. 

Well it's time to sign off.

More from London,
Alex"

"event","Last night I felt that I should go get the feel of Rotterdam rather than sitting in the Hostel.  I wandered around the neighborhood I'm in till I came across this nice bar called Cafe' Voigt.  It was a really nice place, the decor was pretty minimal, the lighting was a step or two above dim.  A few locals sitting around drinking and a bartender who spoke English.  I decided to play Canadian, see what it's like for out freinds up North.  Apparentley Canada liberated the Netherlands after WW II, so they love Canadians here.  Speaking with a few locals I got a feeling that the Dutch are not as keen on the Euro as thier leaders.  They are defintley worried about Germany trying to manipulate the Euro economically.  After two world wars who can blame them.  Playing Canadian was fun and I even got a free beer out of it.

On the way home stopped off, got a Donner Kabab, they're 4 euro here despite beeing poorer quality than the 2 euro Berlin ones.  Oh well, I was hungry.  Trying to get rid of the last of my Euro's before heading to the UK.

Oh yeah, Rotterdam has their own Space Needle type tower called the EuroMast.  It seems that the Space Needle is not as unique as I thought it was.  Toronto has one, Berlin has a bit TV tower/resturant, and now Rotterdam does.  They all seem to be built around the relitivley same time.  I guess during the late 50's and early 60's it was popular to build large self supporting towers to look over you city.

People here love thier cellphone rings, everytime one goes off it's a different song in the monotone beeping.  It's a selection of everything, little Ricky Martin here, a bit of  Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" over there...somone just have the first few notes of Evenessence's ""Bring Me To Life"".  It's annoying but they only last 15 seconds or so, but just enough time to pick up the tune and get it stuck in your head...La la la, La la la la la.

Today I got up and decided to hit my final two museums in Rotterdam.  I attended the Netherlands Architecture Museum (http://www.nai.nl/e/index.html) where they had a huge exhibit examing traffic patterns and the freeway system from some of the largest citys in the world.  The goal was to design better freeways, ones that help get cars where they neeed to go, but also using the space given to you efficently.  A few groups sought to put parking lots in the collums of these new highways.  Others thought to architecturaly  create a slower speed car via creative landscaping.  On the bottom floor were a bunch of different cars that were assoicated with these major metropolis freeways.  Los Angeles' was a white Ford Bronco, Mexico City was the classic VW Bug, Some huge Netherlands freeway crossing was a old Renault.  You could go sit in these cars while a movie played in front of you featuring traffic in these citys.  The ideas were interesting, I don't know how many of them would make it.

After that I went to the FotoInstitue which held a fairly small exhibit about cars (called Varooom!!).  Lots of pictures taken by Ameturs and Pro's blown up to 9 feet tall.  Each scene featured something to do with a car.  Whether it be a lowrider bouncing up and down, or a union leader assasinated in his car, it was there on the wall in front of you.  It was pretty small, only about 35 pictures or so.  Then there was the very small exhibit faturing bycicles in various competition tour's (Tour de France, Amstel Tour, etc), had some nice pictures there.  It was all in Dutch but I could make out some of the titles.  It really wasn't a museum with a permanet collection, as much as it was an art gallery with different photographic exhibits passing through.  I guess that's why it's an Institute and not a Museum.

Well tommorow I leave for London to meet up with Jake.  I guess my Brazilian friend ran into the lead singer of Coldpaly while in Amsterdam.  Apparentley he had a very ""cold"" personality, she'll let me know all the details in London.  One nice thing about the UK is they use a different plug system than mainland Europe.  I lost my adapter plug in Hamburg and have been borrowing from people ever since (Circus let me use thier addapter).  I'll be able to recharge all my eletronic devices before I head home.  I may even be able to attach a few pictures in England as well.  We'll see how it goes.

Anyway a few links before I go:

"event","Quite a difference from Elephant and Castle, this is a name of one of the subway stops in Rotterdam.  Don't eeven ask me how to pronounce it, I don't know.

Well Rotterdam is certianly a beuatiful city, though I must say this hostel is DULL!!  There were a couple of backpackers last night, talked to them breifly, and there were some people in town for a confrence of some kind.  They all packed out this morning, who knows who will be there when I get back.  Guess I'll find out.  As you can guess I really didn't do much last night, everything in Rotterdam pretty much ends at 6pm.  So I sat around the Hostel and watched some TV with a guy from NYC and a girl from Scotland till I was tired enough to go to sleep.  

In the morning I met a Nigerian artist who was in town for a exhibition.  His paintings were nice, I bought one off him in the morning for 20 euros.  It's an oil painting on canvas, and it fits nicely in my bag so I won't have to worry about sending it home.  It will look cool on the wall above the living room couch in the 6414 house.

Today I went to The Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum (http://www.boijmans.nl) here in Rotterdam whcih contained something like 120,000 pieces of Art.  I toured through the classical dutch painters from the 15th to 17th century, then moved on to more modern works by Rembrandt, Monet, Van Gogh, Degas, Salvador Dali, and Man Ray.  There were some just increidble pieces there, especially the Dali ones (never seen a Dali painting in person before).  The museum was kind of a maze with it's room leading to other rooms which led to dead ends and so on.  It was a very unusal museum to say the least.  Unavoidable was the Moder Art section which is where I saw the greatest piece of Modern Art crap ever.  Some guy had gone out and bough a small cafe table (looks more like a large stool), and a small metal fan, and some white thin cloth.  He had attached the cloth around the table, so it hung down and covered the legs of the table and barley touched the floor.  Then the ""artist"" stuck the fan on the floor, aimed it at the table legs, and turned it on.  The result was that it blew the cloth slightly and created a nice breeze.  I mean really, what the hell would convince somone to purchase this piece of crap and stick it in a Museum?  What the hell is wrong with people, a cheap metal fan on the floor, blowing a cloth draped table is NOT ART.  The video exhibits were equally disapointing, one guy just had an aqua colored square being projected on a wall.  Another had somehow made lines on his that went up and down about every three seconds against a white backgorund.  I don't know why I torture myself by paying money to look at these things.  

I mean what the hell is this, it's a bunch of multicolered aluminum boxes bolted together: http://boijmans.kennisnet.nl/engels/collec/mk/mk8b.htm.

This is Art:
http://boijmans.kennisnet.nl/collec/graphmk/b75364.jpg

Tommorow I plan to go to the Architecture Museum, and the Photography Institute.  I do like the architecture in Rotterdam, they have a lot really nice buildings here.  The Achitecture museum seems like a must do.  After the museum I got caught up in a big rainstorm that was passing over town.  I ran under some awning, swaped out my coat for the parka in my backpack I wandered all downtown, looking at everything, I passed through this great street market (like the once Cindy & Joel took me too in Paris) down by the Library.  Got myself some small cheese wedges of about 5 differnt type of cheese.  Some Blue, some Gudda, and some I can't even begin to pronounce.  

Went to the Library, caught up on the days news by reading the Internationl Herald Tribune (published by the NY Times) and USA Today international.  They have a very nice libary, it's housed in this strange cubist style building with bright yellow pipes on it.  It was very nice to sit down and read the papers on the little scetching tables they have.  They also had a big selection of music and moies you could check out (besides the numerous books I can't read beacuse they're in Dutch).  Seen a lot of people reading the new Harry Potter book, though I haven't seen it availabe in any book stores I've been in (proably sold-out).  Have to pick up a copy when I get to England, I have a long flight home, lots of reading time.

After ending up getting lost in the city's finacial dist, I finally found my way back to the easyInternet Cafe'.  You know they even have computers you can use at McDonalds here.  I know cause I had to go to the bathroom really bad and McD's was the only place I could find a toliet.  Oddly enough they sell Quarter Pounders in the Netherlands despite being on the Metric system.  Seems to e quite popular, I haven't seen an empty McD's since arriving in the Netherlands.  Another thing they have here is KFC, which I had not seen in any other country but England, there's at least three downtown.  Yet to see a Starbucks though, which seems odd for such a large coffee drinking population.

Well hoe things pick up at the Hostel, otherwise I might have to watch TV again.  I finished my books, so there's not much else to do.  I'll keep my hoeps up that some interesting people checked in today.

Well till next time,
Alex"

"event","Let's see where was I, ah yes 2 nights ago.  

Day 1: The girl with the beautiful poetry...

Fininshed doing my LiveJournal entry, wandered back to the Hostel and sat down in the Chiil Zone...kind of a big flat area with lots of pillows next to big windows.  A while later some people joined me, a girl and a guy.  Anyway it turns out she is doing her Post-Doctorate in Physics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  This is the same place where my Brother-In-Law is getting his PhD in Engineering (small world).  Anyway we really hit it off well, chatted about a lot about stuff, she read me some of her poetry.  We played chess against an Austrian guy (we lost), but hanging out with her was a lot of fun, she was a really great person.  We only hung out for that one night, it was a lot of fun, I miss her already.

Day 2: Self-Portrait as a Tree...

Got up, got breakfast (provided by the Hostel) which was pretty skimpy to say the least.  Caught the light rail (very popular in both Berlin and Amsterdam) to the Stedelijk Museum (http://www.stedelijk.nl) which low and behold contained a selection of Modern Art.  I swear to you this may be the last Modern Art museum I will ever visit.  I took the audio tour which raved about the lines, the diaganols, the lack of focus that these pieces had.  Some guy had pasted a color photo of a window on to a black canvas, so it looked like you were in some sort of tower or something.  It was original but very simple.  Then some guy had painted the wall in pastel colors in different vertical and horizontal patterns broken up by black lines.  Then some guy stuck a bunch of junk and enclosed it it a big metal casing with thick glass windows.  This is what some people call art, I can't say I get it.  The starngest one of all was the one where the girl was her art.  There were three tv sets all playing different pieces of ""art"", on set one we see the lady dancing naked to bongos wearing a black veil over her head (the goal I guess was for dance until she was totally exausted and passed out on the floor).  The second TV was her strapped to a surgical table in what could be considered a christ like pose, we only saw her upper torso.  She was being prodded and poked off screen forcing her to scream, the goal here was to scream unitl she passed out from pain or could scream no more.  The final tv displayed her looking at the camrea reciting anything that comes to her mind, this one supposedly goes on for three hours.  Once again, I don't get it.

Downstairs they had a lot of photographs, some of which were really good, some of which were just average.  My favorite title was on this photo somone had taken of this tree at a farmhouse entitled ""My Self-Portrait as a Tree"", that I found to be quite amusing.  I really should do a series like that and try to pawn it off as Modern Art.  They also had a great section of Amnesty International posters...and this really cool poster that I stuck me as very powerful.  It had three empty bullet sheels and one actuall bullet (proably from a rifle) situated on a black background.  Below the three empy cassings was white text, the first one was JFK and listed the date he was shot, next one was MLK and the date he was shot, the thrid one was RFK and the date he was shot.  Below the live bullet it read ""who's next?""

From there I went to the Van Gogh museum (http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl), which was very nice and very long.  They had tons and tons of Van Gogh paintings (including ""Sunflowers"", and ""Van Gogh's Bedroom"") from his various painting stages.  I started from the top and worked my way down, there were lots and lots of great paintings.  They had some Modern Art on display in the lobby where they tried to compare Van Gogh peices to later modern artists.  Overall it was a good museum, very crowded, but worthwhile.  If you visit one museum in Amsterdam, my favorite would still be the Ridjk Museum.

After finishing the museums it was after 5, so the Ridjk was closed.  I walked around downtown for a while, and headed back to the Hostel.  I had just started checking my eamil when I heard somone call my name, it was Marisa, a cool girl from Brazil who had been in the same room as me at The Circus.  I'd given her a Devil Duck with my email on it cause she was way cool.  Anyway we decided we'd go explore the city, we walked for hours cause I got back to the Hostel about 5:30, met her at 6, and didn't get back to the Hostel till 1am or so.  We're going to try and find each other in London because we're apparentley there at the same time.  She's a teacher's assistant at a Private School in San Paulo, Brazil.  We wandered everywhere, we walked up this ship front that had been converted into a bar, we watched the sun go down on the city (which was cool after seeing some Van Gogh and Renior paintings of Amsterdam susnsets earlier that day).  We went to this bar that was well over 150 years old, the bartendress had photos she's gotten off the internet to prove it.  Anyway we stayed out way late and eneded up clear on the other side of town by the time we decided to head back.  Two of the locals infomed us that it was not especially safe to walk back to Central Station, said a lot of bad stuff had been happening latley.  SO we caught a cab, I walked her back to her Hostel, said good night, went back to mine and went to sleep.

Amsterdam is a nice place, but it's very dirty.  Lot's of really scarry looking people roam the streets.  Including the guy who threatened to kick my ass cause I wuld not talk to him.  So he got in my face, threatned to kick my ass, I asked him what he wanted, he couldn't get over the ass-kicking part so I walked around him and moved on.  Obviously what he had to say wasn't very improtant otherwise he would have told me when I finally asked him what he wanted.  Lot of people walk around Amsterdam perpetually stoned too.

Day 3: Rotterdam or bust...

Got up, packed all my stuff, checked out, gave away my map to some new arivals, and said goodbye to Amsterdam.  Caught my train, no problems, made it to Rotterdam.  Now everyone in Rotterdam seems to have a different recomendation on how to get to the Hostel.  Cops said the train, train police said ask the info booth, info booth said catch a bus.  So I cuaght a bus, eneded up somewhere else, got a light rail back to Central Station before taking the underground to the Hostel.  Made it there, checked in, and just wandered on down here.  Rotterdam is a lot nicer, and a lot less sketchy.  There really isn't a centralized red light dist. like there was in Amsterdam, there are coffeeshops but they are few and far between.  It's a nice change from Amsterdam as well.

One more quick thing.  I got a nice system for sorting my regular pocket change from my 1 and 2 euro coins.  I carry around my wallet in my front pocket (especially in Amstrerdam where they have big signs saying beware of pickpocketers), then put all the 1 and 2 Euro coins in my back pocket.  I really like the 1 and 2 euro coins, makes it really simple to pay for things.  Just when you think you have no cash, you check your back poket and there's 8 Euros in coins.  They really should do this in the US, coins last longer and are cheaper to make.  I can't say I saw very many Sacajawea dollar coins.  but I think if they stopped printing the $1 bill and replaced it with $1 and $2 coins people would adapt very quickly.

Well off to go on more adventures...

Day 3: Stones in museums collect no moss...

Well today I went to the Pergamon museum, home of the famed gates to Babylon, whose hanging gardens were on of the seven wonders of the ancient world.  It was quite large in size, took up the entire room.  How did the gate end up in Berlin?  I guess when the Egyptians(?) dug the gates up in 1928 or so they decided they didn't want it.  Immediatley a German historical group persuaded the German Govt. to purchase it and place it in a museum.  I guess the area where it stands has reinforced walls to keep the gates from being damaged in WW II.  The Pergamon museum was full of thousands of ancient artifacts, ranging from greeko-roman statues, to persian carpets, and ancient muslim mosque's.  It's a very nice museum, they even have a electonic walk through in 5 languages for free.  How cool is that.  Took me about 4 or 5 hours to see everything, there was a lot of stuff.

After that I just decided to walk for a bit, a neighborhood (a Turkish area) one of the staff had reccomended was pretty close, so I thought I'd take a look.  I walked about a mile or so before I got to the really interesting stuff.  I passed a few cafe's and nifty resturants but I was more intersted in checking out the thrift & music stores.  I found this really cool gallery that was putting up some comic book art for an exhibition the next day.  The stuff was really good, it was very lifelike and had a vampire theme to it.  i got his website, I'll put it up when I have the flyer handy.  Anyway he had a lot of cool stuff on the walls, I especially liked the drawing of two guys in shriner hats who were standing in front of this classy 60's looking car.  Something about it caught my eye, maybe it was the facial expressions, maybe it was the pose, but it was defintley my favorite of the ones I saw.  Later I went into a punk records shop, I browsed though the music (they wanted 16.99 euros for a used/scrathched Decendants album, not a chance) and almost bought a cool t-shirt.  I had to flip a 2 euro coin on it, it came up tails twice so I moved on.

Walked past this fire station that had hired some spray paint artists to decorate it.  it was really classy looking, lots of cool graphice.  I got pictures which I'll be sure to post when I get a chance.  Got on a S-Bahn which dropped me off at the longest remaining stretch of the wall.  it's about 2 miles long, just a few rail stops south of downtown.  Some kids were spay painting it, got some pictures of that and some of the really good ones (including the famous DDR President smooching Kruchev).  I went to the big sand sculpure exhibit they had on the Westen side.  They had some incredible stuff, somone had carved a giant digital camera in the palm of a hand.  Another had made this huge tower with carvings of people and cars.  It was very very impresssive.

Went back to the hostel via Alexanderplatz (I always want to giggle whn I hear that name), hung out in the lobby and met some canadians, auzzies, and kiwis.  It was a good day, my feet need rest so I went to bed.

---
I'm currentley in Amserdam, it's 1:50am, those who know me know I can't stay up past 2am in any time zone.  I'll play catch up in the morning.  Having tons of fun.

"event","Well I'm back in Lille again after failing to catch my train to Hamburg.  I got my train out of Brugge all right, but I didn't make it to the station in time after picking up my camera from the Hostel.  One more night in France, I'm getting up at 6ish to catch my train at 7:05am. I must have sat in the train station forever before I asked if I should catch the train going to Liege (the first stop).  The lady promptly explained that the train had already left at 14:10, it was about 16:20.  When they help you out they don't usually list the departure time of the 1st train.

So to pass my time in Lille I decided to go see Confessions of a Dangerous Mind at a French Theatre.  American movies are sometimes dubbed over in French, I got lucky this one only had French Subtitles (seems like a good way to pick up some basic French).  The theatre was really odd though, it was like no theatre I had ever seen.  You walk in, there are rows and rows of idetical redish orange theatre seats, the screen is a big white mololith looking rectangle about 30 feet long and 10 feet high almost floating  on the wall in front of you.  The celing is made of these black tiles which appear to be about 6 inches square.  The walls are a hazzy orange color with a big yellow stripe running down the middle on each side.  So your sitting there in your seat, with these rows of identical seats that are empty.  While your waiting for the movie to begin they play weird new age reed music, it's quite peacefull and tranquil.  The lights were dimmed in such a way I really felt I was sitting in some sort of Surrealist art piece at the Museum of Modern Art.  It was a very odd feeling that's for sure.   Overall the movie was better than I expected, but I defintley think the Theatre was the best part.

Also I managed to walk back to the Hostel without getting lost or asking for directions, quite an accomplishmet in France.  The staff here has been quite nice this time, I do miss Brugge, the place I was staying was a quality Hostel.  Still need to wash my clothes but I think that will have to wait for Hamburg.  Going to wear what I'm wearing now, it's faster and they don't smell bad (yet).  It gets dark a lot later here, I came out of the cinema and it was about 9:30, it felt like 6am in Washington, very twilightish.

I'm going to head to bed now, I've got a long day of traveling tommorow.

Au Revous from Lille,
Alex"

"event","Well I'm defintley glad I stayed an extra day, you meet all sorts of interesting people while traveling.  I started off my day wandering around town.  Brugge is beautiful, I'd have to say it's one of those rare gems of Europe.  The churches, the food, the the old relics from thousands of years ago.  Brugge was spared in World War II by some Nazi official who decided it was to beautiful to invade and ruin it.  I guess they named a street in his honor for saving the city though no one can seem to remember where it is.

I was wandering and ended up in the southern part of Brugge.  It's really beautiful and the architecture is just stunning.  One of the more amazing things is this old stone foot bridge just to the south of the main tourist drags that's at least 700 years old.  I really enjoy this city, I could defintley retire here, though I'd have to learn Dutch (or Flemmish, the local Dutch dialect).  Walking around I noticed there are a lot of boats moored up in one canals.  I guess people from all over Europe come and hang out in Brugge while living off their houseboats.  So far the only anooying thing about Brugge is the pigeons.  They don't seem to be normal piegons that you find all over the US and Europe, they seem to be a special hybrid pigeon that's genetically enginnered to be as annoying as possible.  The worst part about them is that sound they make, it's like a ""Twoohoo whooo, Twooohooo wooo"" and you can hear it all over town because they're so loud and there are so many of them.  Kill the pigeons and you'll have a the best town ever.

One of the other interesting things about Brugge is the swans.  The swans seem to have been brought in specially to make the tourists happy.  They only hang out in certian canals, and they have these cute little baby swans that swim all around with the mother swan.  It's sooo cute.  

In the souther end of Brugge they have a lot of beautiful public parks and some classic old houses.  They also have what appears to be the remains of a castle.  I came across what could only be described as a castle entrance, it was situated right across a canal and seemed about the right size to hold a drawbridge.  The rest of the castle seems to be gone, but about 200 yards in each way are two towers that looked like guard towers.  I guess the castle is gone but various parts remain and you can kind of guess what it looked like.  Another popular element around town is living in old churches, a lot of them have been convered into private houses.  Lots of cool things like that.

Wandering around yesterday I came across a movie shoot, it was some action movie.  Didn't find out very much about it, but they converted a small square into a fake bomb blast scene.  It was pretty realistic, they even had a plaster version of the square's main statue which had been made to appear like it had survied the blast.  Apprentley it was a nice day in the city when the bomb went off,they had several people made up in fake blood, also a lot of real emergency vehicles ready to help the victims.

Today I have to catch a train to Lille, pick up my camera, then hop a train for Hamburg.  Luckilly they're not very far apart, but I will proably spend a majority of the day traveling.  I also have to do laundry badly, I'm wearing my last clean shirt.  All the other ones smell like dirty laundry.  Hopefully all will go well and I'll have a day to explore Hamburg tommorow before heading off to Berlin the next day.

I higly reccomend if your visiting Europe that you stop and visit Brugge, it's just an incredible city, like nothing else I've ever seen.

Oh yeah, before I forget...the latest styles for women in Paris are pinstripes and shirts that go below your waist and are cut in a diagonal angle on the bottom.  The shirt-skirts are usually complimented by tight fitting black pants (or pinstriped pants).  People in Europe dress very nicely, I really stuck out in Lille. I also failed to get a snowglobe in Lille, I guess it wasn't a big enough tourist town to justify their own snowglobe.  I got a pretty good one here, along with a cheezy ""It's a small world after all"" looking European flag globe.  It has two very aryan looking children holding hands and skipping, above them are all the flags of Western Europe.  I couldn't pass up on that one.  I'm doing pretty good, still have 4 snowglobes left to hand out.

Talk to you all later,
Alex"

"event","I must say Brugge is very cool, I'm liking it more and more.  It's really just a tourist town but it has a great vibe about it.  There are several enourmous cathedrials all in classic Gothic style, several great museums, and a really cool nightlife.

After leaving off yesterday I wandered around town for a bit, the city is quite striking.  Everything looks straight out of the 16th century (minus the cars and tourists of course).  There are cannals everywhere, and you can take boat tours around the whole town.  I merged into several tourist groups and listened as they explained the history of various parts of town.  I visited the chappel where there is a statue of the virgin mary and baby jesus carved by Michaelangelo (one of the few ever to leave Italy in his life).  After wandering around for awhile I walked on over to the Groeninge Museum where they have numerous paintings from all over the Netherlands, Belgium, and beyond.  When you go to the museums in Europe you can get these little phone type devices that you walk around with, they're little tour guides.  You enter the number next to the painting and it gives you a little history and information about the painiting.  It's quite cool, and they're usually free with addmission.

After the museum I went on a Brewery tour with some French people.  The Brewmister was nice enough to give the tour in both languages.  They don't bottle the beer, it's all sold on sight or packed in kegs and sent to local bars. It was quite a facinating tour, I'd been on one before at the Olympia brewery but this one was a much smaller opperation. After the tour we got free samples of the three types of beer they made there (the blonde, the amber, and the dark).  All were quite tasty.  While I was trying my free samples I got into a conversation with a nice British couple who  had just come back from Munich.  I guess he's the European rep for Hustler Lawnmowers.  They wanted to know all about the US because they were thinking about retiring there (I guess they feel Tony Blair is leading the country to economic ruin).  The man had served in the British army and had faught in the Falklands.  We talked about a lot of things, where we'd been, what parts of Europe were best, etc.  We were there till the brewpup closed, not wanting to stop talking I pointed out that there was a pub within short walking distance that served 300 different types of Belgian beer.  

This was defintley the hilight of the day, they only had 3 or 4 beers on tap but I guess they must have a huge storage area below the bar for bottles.  They had a whole menu of beers that was about 15 pages long.  Imagine that, fifteen pages of beer all of which you can order.  This was also a really cool bar because a lot of the locals actually drank there (always a good sign) so I got to talking to a few of them as well.  They were very helpful in recomending which beers to try, they all had their own favorites.  

The British couple and I continued talking for quite awhile about all things British and American. We met several other Brits as a few Americans all who joined us in our revelrey.  The thing about Belgian beer is that the weakest one is 5.5% alcohol, it only goes up from there.  I tried several different ones and eneded up a bit tipsy.  I cut myself off after a while because I did not want to be drunk while walking back to the Hostel in a foriegn city (it's easy to get lost when the street signs are about 15 feet up on the sides of buildings).  After saying goodbye to my drinking buddies I wandered back to the Hostel which was conveiently about three blocks away.  I settled in and went to sleep.  I woke up this morning with a slight hangover but it went away after I drank some water.

Talk about a great day, get to see incredible art, take a brew tour, meet interesting people from all over the world, then go drinking with them.  Europe is very cool like that.  I'm also supposed to visit Prauge, one of the locals highly reccomended it.  Have to be next time.  One more day in Brugge then off to Hamburg.

Oh yeah, good news, they found my camera.  I'm going to catch a train there, pick it up, then hop another train for Hamburg.  I don't know if it still has all my film and stuff (I hope so).  I don't think they could get into the bad since is was locked with a numerical code lock that was pretty sturdy.  I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

This internet cafe (www.happyrom.com) must be making a fortune, you get about 3 hours for seven euros.  You sit down at your terminal and enter your code.  The machines are behind a big cabinet, the keyboard is glued to the desk along with the trackball mouse next to it.  The chairs are chained the cabinet, and the machines are all running Red Hat 8.0 (Linux).  I would imagine this is a very cheap place to run, there's not even an attendant, everything is automated.

Anyway off to see the rest of Bruge, maybe try and catch the bike tour.  Will let you know how it goes.

Till then...

PS:
Spainards are very loud, bunch of them just walked in and sat down.  The guy next to me shouts really loud whenever something goes wrong or talking to his friend at the next terminal (about 15 inches away).  It's really annoying, but I guess being very loud is a stereotypical Spainish trait in Europe."

"event","So it appears my bad luck on Friday the 13th transfered to the 14th.  I left my camera and luggage in a ""secure room"" that the hostel provided for 1.5 euros.  Well when I was out exploring Lille someone was back in the ""secrure room"" jacking my 35mm camera.  When I came back the ""secure room"" was wide open and the front desk was empty.  That made me feel real confident in the security of the ""secure room"".  Anyway it's gone, nothing I can do about it.  Bitched at the staff for half an hour or so and went to the police station to file a report.

Filing a policie report in a foriegn country where neither of you speaks the others language is damed near impossible.  I tried to explain everything here but it was almost immpossible without a translator.  If anytime in my life I felt like a dumb American tourist it was sitting in the room of a French Police station trying to explain how somone had stolen my camera from a ""secure room"" at the hostel I was stayimg.  The police report proably says somone stole it while I was sleeping, I really don't know.  As soon as I had finished that I caught the first train out of dodge or Lille in this case.

Lille was getting really old, esentially it's a big shopping town where the Belgians come to buy cheap goods that would be expensive in thier country.  Unless you have a lot of money to spend, it's really not that exciting.  Has some really nice architecture and a cool classic book market but other than that there's not much to it.  It's hard walking though a steet with thousands of people all speaking a forigen language you don't understand.

Anyway I made it to Brugge in Belium and so far it's been a better place than Lille.  Met a really nice guy named Bint from Thailand, he happened to be staying in the same room I was.  Anyway he was the first person I met, and he seemed like a nice guy.  So we went and hung out on the town, on the way we got to see the Brugge fire department in action, some builing was smoldering down the street (never saw any flames).  The fire trucks are much smaller here, I'd say about the size of an aid car with about 4 feet added to the back end.  It's quite different, they need to be this way to navigate through the maze of one way streets and tight corridors that are common in many european cities.

We picked a bar at random and sat down had a drink.  I guess he's been on the road for 7 weeks, during that time he'd been to Italy, Austria, Amsterdam, Munich, and a few other places.  I guess he went to a huge 3 day rock festival in central Germany where Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Audioslave played.  Sounds like a cool festival.  We met several Brits who were at the next table who were all very nice.  The bar was situated in a plaza just off from the main church in town.  The plaza has about 15 bars in it, all cramped ito storefronts that are about 40 feet wide. Anyway the plaza is filled with people from all other countries, some of who decided to break into traditional songs when in groups of 10 or 20.  It felt like a soccer tournament might on a good day, whith each teams fans chanting and signing for thier side.  The Itallians vs the French, the Spanish vs the Germans, etc.  It was quite livley to say the least.

Today I plan to go explor the town and find the pub with the 300 Belgian beers on tap, I'd imagine this would be quite a sight to see.

Funny things in Lille:
Seeing a shop called The San Diego Shop selling western gear like you would find in Texas.  A place called Paris Texas that was shut down (might have been a resturant at one time).  Seeing the French equivlent of McDonalds called Quick, had pretty much the same menu.

I'm still annoyed that I don't still have my camera, I lost a lot of great pictures of Paris.  There's really nothing I can do but keep going, I'm making sure I lock up all my stuff to something solid whenever I go out.  Still having fun despite the loss, but it could have been much worse.

I should go out and try some Belgian food..."

"event","Well yesterday Cindy & Joel had things to do during the day, so I was left to explore the city on my own.  If anything going out on my own taught me how things in Paris work.  I started off the day thinking I'd make a quick stop at the train station before heading off to the Musee D'Orsay (Orsay Museum), and if I was lucky get some stamps at a local Tobacoo shop (which is who you buy stamps from in Paris) for postcards.  After about 6 hours I managed to accomplish two of my goals.  

I started off trying to take the Metro (subway) to a train scheduler to find out if I needed to make reservations on train out of Paris.  It looked really easy on paper, just a quick trip down the #3 line.  We'll when I got out I looked all over for the place I was trying to find, I got lost a lot, asking several people directions.  Finally I got to a travel agency, they told me I needed to go to a train station.  So I went to a train station, this was extremely difficult because a lot of Govt. workers are on strike, this means the Metro runs on a very limited schedule and skips stops.  Once there I waited in line with 25 other people for to talk to the two very slow attendants.  Welcome to Paris on strike, expect one or two people to be working very slowly if at all.  Meanwhile more people arrive and they work even slower.  On the positive side, I did have a very nice conversation with a Franco-Polish guy who was in queue (line) with me.

As it turn out you don't have to make reservations for short trips, wasted 45 min in line to find that out.  So accomplishing that, I decided to head out to the D'Orsay.  Again, things always look easier to get to on paper.  I got on the right metro train going the right direction, but apparently it no longer stops at the D'Orsay stop, in fact the nearest it gets is two stops down.  No problem, I've got a map, a compass, and a college degree, I can figure out how to get there from this Metro stop.  Well I got lost several times and probably went the wrong direction for half of it.  Funny thing about French landmark signs, they may point you the right direction but fail to put another sign up when the road splits in two.  Getting lost in Paris is not always a bad thing; the city is littered with all sort of interesting churches and shops that you can only find by exploring.  I wandered what seemed like for two hours (not bad for being two metro stops off), and was about to give up when I saw another landmark sign; the D'Orsay was within my grasp.  Feeling exhausted I stopped at one of the local cafe's for a beer; it was there I learned that the D'Orsay museum was closed, they were on strike.  Welcome to Paris, where it seems everyone is perpetually on strike.  :)

So being let down on not getting to see one of the finest museums in the world, I decided I should get some stamps and mail some postcards to the folks back home.  Finding a tobacco shop that actually carries .69 cent stamps is near close to impossible.  I went to at least 5 different shops; none of them could help me.  After another round of getting lost on Quai Voltaire (where they have an bridge with an incredibly huge multi-arch monument on the end of it) and with the help of friendly tobaccoists I was able to find a Poste.  Again we have this customer service problem, we have one person helping 25 people and another employee (probably the manager) wandering around just watching things and not helping.  Paris is a great city, but they really need to work on their customer service, I can only begin to imagine how the Russians felt under communism.  Anyway the lady sold me .90 cent stamps and not .69 cent ones, proably because I was American.  Oh well, as long as the folks back home are happy.  :)

Later that day I caught up with Joel at the Big Head, turns out there is a huge underground shopping mall under the big head.  They even have little stores in some of the Metro stops it's pretty unique.  From there we met Cindy and her conversation partner (not uncommon to trade English lessons for French ones in Paris), and went up to the church made famous by the movie Amilie' (the part where she makes the guy walk follow the green arrows to the top).  You get a incredible view of Paris from up there, you realize just how big the city is.  

Heading home was a big pain in the ass because of course the Metro workers are on strike.  We must have waited something like 20 minutes for a train, when it did arrive it was choc full of people.  While on the train a dopey looking American? tourist (big fat guy white with a NY Yankees cap, definitely looked out of place) was pick pocketed by some thief.  Luckily for him there were undercover cops on the train, at the next stop he tried to get off the train.  He was subsequently tackled by three people and pinned to the floor and put in cuffs.  The thief was placed on a bench, not more than 30 seconds had passed when the thief tried to escape (still in cuffs mind you).  He was once again tackled to the ground and held till three uniformed police offices took him away.  It was quite exciting to watch.  Nothing much else happened after that, we made it back to the apartment, had dinner, and went to bed.

Today we just kicked it around the apartment because we were feeling lazy and it was really hot out.  Though we did go to this great graveyard just a few blocks from where C&J live.  Jim Morrison and countless other people are buried there.  Jim's grave was rather non-descript and you would have missed it if not for the swell of young people that are drawn to it (myself included).  

Tomorrow will be my final night in Paris; I definitely want to come back.  There is still so much to be seen and done, countless churches to find, endless museums to visit, lots of great wine to taste.

I guess getting work is here is really hard without working papers (think H1B Visas or Green Cards back in the states), so Joel is finding it tough to get a job even as a chef.  The goal though is for them to move to Southern France where Joel would be a chef at nice sit-down restaurant along the boulevard.  Hopefully Joel will find something and be able to get his working papers, I'm rooting for him.  After spending just three days here, I already don't want to go back to the States.  I can see why they are trying hard not to leave France, it's so easy just to hop a train and be immersed in an entirely different culture or a different part of history.  

My next stop will probably be Rouen in the north of France; it's about an hour and a half by train.  From there I'll head to Brogue, then off to Germany to see Hamburg and Berlin.  I'm very excited to see the rest of Europe, but I'll definitely miss Paris as well as Cindy and Joel."

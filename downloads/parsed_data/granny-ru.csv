"event","Arrrrrg! I am so frustrated with some of my classmates right now! I just got done working with a group on a presentation we have to do next Monday and it was not pretty (I'm sure the rest of the group thought it was fine but that's only because they couldn't actually hear anything that I was trying to say). This group seems to have decided what they want all of the answers to be and then done research to prove what they wanted to be correct. Perhaps this is just the scientist in me lashing out but that isn't research (it's politics)! There was a serious problem with knowing the difference between fact and opinion and that lead to some pretty serious oversights also. Overall, it was a pretty horrendous group meeting and seems like it is going to be a presentation where i just spout off the information I have found on the internet and don't bother explaining or going into detail or the presentation will turn into a debate (and probably not a pretty one). I think that what really puts me over the edge in so many of these discussions here is that we look at scientific topics but leave the science out of the picture. We look at biological issues and solve them based strictly on feelings or we look at geological issues and try to apply emotional solutions to them and sometimes things just don't work that way. Usually ranting helps me to vent but I'm actually getting more fired up (and my words aren't working for me) now so I'm going to stop. There may or may not be more of this rant yet to come. Have a great day!"

It is supposed to rain today which would make being inside all day a bit easier but I really want to go fly a kite and play frisbee and then end the day with a good game of softball! That sounds like a great day! Guess I'll be dreaming about that as I sit through 9 hours of class, a potluck and a meeting over the course of the next 13 hours. At least I like all of my classes. I have a little paper due this evening that I haven't started yet so I'm going t be working on that during class today. Well, happy Monday, readers!"

"event","So this morning church made me really scared for what is going to happen at my church when I am gone. On Easter, between the sunrise service and the regular service, we always have a breakfast. All week I have been trying to figure out who was in charge of it so that I knew if people were supposed to bring stuff or not. Turns out the reason that I couldn't find whoever was supposed to be in charge was because NO ONE was in charge of it. No one made the coffee or organized the event. Not a huge deal but still ridiculous. Then, we had an egg hunt scheduled for 9:00 and when no one was there yet at 8:30 to hide the nearly 300 eggs that I made the youth prepare Friday night I hid them (I was not in charge of this either). I don't mind doing these things but soon I am not going to be there anymore and then they are not going to be able to just plan things and not plan on having people there to carry them out. I feel really bad and am really scared for my church but I cannot help them with this one (because I am not going to be there which is why this is an issue). 

My sister-in-laws parents are in town right now and they are awesome! I love when they are in town. We went to the Spaghetti Factory last night for her birthday and it was a great time! Now I am working on lunch for the whole family and that is going to be a good time to! So far its been a good day but it has already made me aware of the issues that are going to come from the next several years at least."

"event","Well, this is holy week and holy week for a seminary student is crazy even if you don't have a church placement (who'd have guessed that, right?). I was talked into chaperoning a lock-in Friday night after the Good Friday service and I think it is going to be great but I also think that Good Friday needs to bring to light some of the suffering of Christianity and so I want to do a Bible study that will make the kids cry but feel like that's probably not a good idea.... Idk... Hopefully the Good Friday service will make me cry and then I can get that out of my system. 

In other news, my grandma has been having some problems with her blood pressure lately and when she went to the hospital last week they told her that if it keeps happening, she is going to have to be put on a monitor for a while and that may lead to a pace maker. So now she is going around telling people that she is getting a pacemaker... NOT WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID GRANDMA!!! So now people are calling me and e-mail me to express their concern about Grandma getting a pacemaker and it just isn't true. My grandma needs a hobby because otherwise she picks something to fixate on and drives everyone crazy. Sometimes its a good thing (usually its a bad thing) but always she gets the story wrong, exaggerates, and makes people go crazy. 

I'm looking forward to this crazy, sleep-free weekend. Tomorrow seining, then fish fry, church, lock-in. Then, Saturday  Cardinals training (for fund raising), games with some friends from home, and then hanging out. Sunday, EASTER!!!!

There's probably more I should write about but that's all I can think of for now and I'm out of time. More ranting to come :)"

"event","Hello again, 
    It has now been almost 3 years since my last post. I cannot believe how high school I was in my previous posts. Since my last post I have graduation from college and am now attending Seminary. I now rarely say the word angst and even more rarely type it. I currently spend 10 hours a week at Nurses for Newborns (which is where I am now) and am supposed to do work on grants and things while I'm there (which I'm obviously not doing). Turns out that once you get senioritis it never goes away. In fact it seems to get worse and worse as I go through more and more school (and I'm not even a senior anymore). I don't really know much else today but intend to start posting things here much more frequently. I tried journaling last fall and I did great for about 2 months and haven't picked it up since so maybe if I try to update here several times a week it will serve the same purpose. Have a great day!"

"event","OMG I'm actually putting stuff in this two days in a row and I just typed OMG!!!!! Well anyway, I have a HUGE history test tomorrow and i'm not looking forward to it. I don't like history and i don't like tests. But.... I get to sleep all day Friday, doodah, doodah! This weekend my sister is coming home and i'm really excited. Plus, swister is going to the competition with me cause she loves me (or something like that) I actually did all of my homework today (except for trig but that doesn't count). Of corse it helped that i didn't have any other homework. Oh well must... sleep.... talk to you later"

"event","So, i decided to set up this journal thing even though nothing ever happens to me. I figured, everyone else is doing it so why shouldn't I? Good reason isn't it? Well that's all i've got to say. Oh yeah and i hate capitalization, punctuation, and proper grammer."

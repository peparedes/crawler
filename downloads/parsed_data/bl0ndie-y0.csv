"event","ok my parents are in bed.

you can leave now

throw rocks at my window

so i can go downstairs and let you in

Follow my footsteps

so the stairs wont creak

Once we reached my room

we let out a sigh of relief

I asked you if you've ever done this before

You said no

I said alright then

we should take this slow

We made our first moves

and now you've got me going

Before i know it

your inside of me as ur body glides with mine

We were like 2 tectonic plates colliding

You whispered in my ear

""Dont be too loud, I wouldnt want them to wake""

I remember that night perfectly

and how I made your earth quake

i'll be your best kept secret
& your biggest mistake"

love that placeits soo cute but anyways i need to go 
to pier one and get a chaira cute one. i duno im just
doing retarded shit with my room im sick of it being
 this ugly tan color its been like this since forever!!
ANYWAYS_

On a better note things have somewhat turned over and 
are bettter _ i miss my friends kbabe dee and starin
i havent seen them in soo long =( but i duno whats goin
on with us -- they seem like they dont give a shit!!

Tomorrow im going to the homecoming festival thing with
My boo David... or bree at like 9ish so i have all day to
pack.. and clean .. and be a lazy bum cause i wont wake up
till like 2 haha its already 5:13

this entry has been a total blah blah of me rambling on about notta
ill have pix from the thing tomorrow and ill update and put pix on



OHHH!! the song ive been looking for FOREVER -- i found ;; well acutally ANTH found it but whatev im excited i like memorized it heh

I'm sittin' here all by myself
just tryin' to think of something to do
Tryin' to think of something, anything
just to keep me from thinking of you
But you know it's not working out
'cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
to leave the rest of the world behind

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back/but I know you did

I'm sittin' here tryin' to convince myself
that you're not the one for me
But the more I think, the less I believe it
and the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
will just kill me if I'm on my own
I know it's not the smartest thing to do
we just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight

I'm sittin' here tryin' to entertain myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration goneit's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything I see reminds me of you
Oh please, baby won't you take my hand
we've got nothing left to prove

And I didn't mean to meet you then
we were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
the way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
No, you didn't mean to love me back
But you did

ya for retards like me its called ;; A lonely September DOWNLOAD IT!

oh and download DHT ;; True love
i love that song


Bye Boo'z ill update tmm."

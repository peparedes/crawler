"event","<p>Well, its been over a month since I posted so I suppose I should probably post something. This was supposed to have been updated more often, but you know, laziness prevailed. So let's get this show on the road.<br /><br />Since beating Half-Life 2 I've finished off 6 more games, so I'll comment on them in bullet points I suppose just to speed this up.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j276/gendo7/sega-megadrive-streets-of-rage-pal.jpg"" /><br /><b><u>06-04-08</u></b><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://backloggery.com/images/bulletcomplete.gif"" /> <b>Completed:</b> Streets of Rage &nbsp;(VC)<br /><br />I actually finally managed to finish off Streets of Rage which had been plauging me for almost an entire year. I had a few cracks at it with Ken, but my partner Ricky and I just randomly pulled it out (or loaded it up I guess, since its a Wii VC download) and beat it. Came out of nowhere actually, considered we weren't even trying to hard. Fun game actually, old school beat em up at its best.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j276/gendo7/hl22007100400225440xx7.jpg"" /><br /><strong><u>06-24-08<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://backloggery.com/images/bulletcomplete.gif"" /></u></strong> <b>Completed:</b> Half-Life 2: Episode One &nbsp;(PC)<br /><br />Episode One was a pretty good continuation of the Half-Life universe, but it wasn't as compelling as Half-Life 2. As most people have said the episode is very short and nothing really new is brought in, but it was still fun.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j276/gendo7/godhanddj0.jpg"" /><br /><strong><u>07-01-08<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://backloggery.com/images/bulletbeat.gif"" /></u></strong> <b>Beat:</b> God Hand &nbsp;(PS2)<br /><br />Ah God Hand, how I love thee. I was a big fan of Clover Studios seeing as they created the amazing and over the top 2D/3D beat'em up: Viewtiful Joe. A game that didn't take itself too seriously and was hilarious and fun because of it. And it was a challenge, which is very rare these days because a lot of games are too easy.&nbsp;<br />They then went on to make&nbsp;the amazing ""Zelda ripoff"" Okami. I use that term in a good way mind you, because Okami emulated that Zelda adventure style to a T.<br />After that came God Hand, and it was the studios swansong. It's unfortunate because God Hand was really a game that only appeals to the hard core gamer. The gamer that has honed his skills over the years and the kind that can take a game that pokes fun at itself, its genre and gaming itself (something very akin to No More Heroes).<br />The game is Hard, unforgivingly so, even on Easy, and that probably alienated a lot of people. Also it has a&nbsp;few problems graphically and play control wise, but not so much to make the game unplayable.<br />Because of these issues, the game probably didn't sell very well, and IGN's completely unforgivable review of 3.0 didn't help sales either. The reviewer really didn't get the point of the game, and I think really sucked at games, because you can't fault a game for being too hard (see: Ninja Gaiden). Look at the rest of the reviews via Metacritic, you'll see a bevy of 80's and the game averages a 73. Decent dammit.</p><p>Anyways, my point is this game is awesome, and it doesn't take shit from anyone. Try it if you fucking dare. =p<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j276/gendo7/space0.png"" /><br /><strong><u>07-08-08<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://backloggery.com/images/bulletbeat.gif"" /></u></strong> <b>Beat:</b> Space Invaders Extreme &nbsp;(NDS)<br /><br />Space Invaders was a lot of fun back in the day, I mean I didn't really grow up around the time it was huge, but I did play it a lot on my Commodore Vic-20! Good times, good times indeed. Videogames on c<span>assette </span>tape, wow.<br />Anyways, 30 years later here comes Space Invaders Extreme, a really really <strong>really </strong>good update on a classic. This is how these should be done honestly. A lot of fun, and I beat it pretty quickly, but still there's HARD MODE. I don't even want to think about that yet. =p<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j276/gendo7/half-life-2-wallpaper.jpg"" /><br /><strong><u>07-13-08<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://backloggery.com/images/bulletbeat.gif"" /></u></strong> <b>Beat:</b> Half-Life 2: Episode Two &nbsp;(PC)<br /><br />What to say about Episode Two? Well, it was waaaaay better than Episode One. I really liked the graphical updates and overall it was pretty damn frantic and fun. Of course, everyones favourite part is gonna be the climactic struggles against the Striders and the Hunters, throwing footballs at their heads and making them explode. Yeah, that was pretty damn awesome. :)</p><p><img alt="""" src=""http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j276/gendo7/mario_kart_wii.jpg"" /><br /><strong><u>07-20-08<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://backloggery.com/images/bulletcomplete.gif"" /></u></strong> <b>Completed:</b> Mario Kart Wii &nbsp;(Wii)<br /><br />Managed to polish off Mario Kart in a few months, slowly getting Gold Cups throughout the 36 Grand Prix.

I don't play many FPS' because I find most of them bland and boring. I like the classics like <i>DOOM</i> and <i>Goldeneye</i>, but I don't stray much. Half-Life was one of the best I'd ever played so I was certain that <i>Half-Life 2</i> would carry on that tradition of awesomeness and it did in spades.<br /><br />I'm almost like 4 years late with this game, but hell if it hasn't held up over time. The visuals are still fantastic compared to todays games and the action is really at an enjoyable pace. I love the immersion you get from it, because you really do get this sense that you're playing as Gordon Freeman. You are him, and that whole silent protagonist thing really works here. Some people don't like it, but I've loved it ever since the days of games like <i>Zelda: A Link to the Past</i> and <i>Chrono Trigger</i>.<br /><br />Just one last thing I want to say about <i>Half-Life 2</i>. It has one of the best, if not the best, endings of all time. I was absolutely blown away by it, and I can't wait to continue on with the series in <i>Half-Life 2: Episode One</i>. I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading, but it was a trip for sure.<br /><br />So, now that I'm done <i>Half-Life 2</i>, I guess I stand at -80! Hurrah! What's next? Probably either <i>God Hand</i> or Penny Arcade's game."

A rather short little game available from WiiWare, Nintendo's download service. 10 bucks buys you around 3 hours worth of entertainment, which was really quite worth it. A very simple but fun platform/adventure game, where you control the protagonist with the thumbstick and the ""wind"" with the remote. Really innovative and fun, a definite recommendation to anybody that has a Wii, that means you. <br /><br />Yeah, go buy this right away!

<br /><br />So I've finally managed to finish off the epic RPG known as Persona 3. It took me a staggering 90 hours but I've accomplished what I've set out to do. I can't believe though that it took me since August 14th of 2007 to beat the game, but then again I did run in to a lot of roadblocks with all the great games coming out. Chief among them were probably Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime 3.<br /><br /><b>What I did like: </b>The art direction and the atmosphere for the game are second to none. Atlus did an awesome job at creating this univserse and I'm really glad to see that we'll be seeing more in Persona 4. The music was fantastic. Poppy and upbeat at times, very different and modern for an RPG for sure. The story wasn't anything with depth but it was a lot of fun regardless. The Persona and Social Links system was awesome too, made for a lot of work getting certain Persona's but the payoff was worth it. The Social Link system has gotta be my favourite part though, I really want to go back and play it again to see the one's that I missed.<br /><br /><b>What I didn't like: </b>Not all that much actually. Sometimes the AI for your party was a little dumb, so that definitely could be improved upon. Graphics wise it didn't push the boundaries of the PS2, but it did what it needed to do I suppose. The game seemed a little drawn out at 80-90 hours.<br /><br />Overall I'd give the game a <b>9.3</b>. I had a great time with it and I have to say it has easily one of my favourite groups of characters in any game ever, RPG or otherwise. All the main characters were great (save for Ken, who was just okay), and I'm actually kinda sad that I have to leave them all behind now. I mean, I do get to play another 30 hour quest in Persona 3: FES, but I will definitely miss all of them once its all over. <br /><br /><br />Mitsuru, Akihiko, Junpei, Fuuka, Yukari, Aigis, Ken, Koromaru, Shinjiro...thanks for the memories. :)"

I'm gonna say overall the experience was pretty similar to the previous games just with some news characters and locales which really refreshed the series. I love Phoenix Wright, and I kinda wish he'd still been the protagonist, but they really weaved a great story around Phoenix, Apollo and Trucy. Everything makes sense, and you understand why Phoenix is no longer practicing law. Though I would love to see him take the bar exam again and step behind the Defenses stand again.<br /><br />Apollo was a great protagonist, and Klavier was a pretty interesting Prosecutor. But he pales in comparison to the likes of Edgeworth, both of the Von Karma's and especially Godot from the exceptional 3rd game in the series.<br /><br />Overall I'd rate the game in the 9's for sure. It's more of the same from the series (not a bad thing!), but its new in different ways. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Now I guess I'll be off to play some Okami or Persona 3. Gotta finish off Persona 3...so close.</div> </div>"

This thing is so much bigger than our own Anime Evolution (3,000 people to 13,000 people), and its pretty much better in every way. Don't get me wrong, I do love AE, but Sakura Con takes the <a href=""http://kotaku.com/assets/resources/2008/03/gingerbreadcompanion.jpg"">cake</a>.<br /><br />So <a href=""http://s167.photobucket.com/albums/u140/rah-bop/Sakuracon08/Valve%20shoot/"">here's a link</a> to a bunch of shots (not mine), from the Valve (Half Life / TF 2 / Portal) shoot on 10 am of the second day. I'm the sole Red Engineer (the one wearing the goggles).<br /><br />Anyways, here's a little breakdown of the con for ya:<br /><br />The Good: HUGE convention hall, lots of things to do, escalators, HUGE dealers room (gotta be like at least 10 times the size of AE's), Penny Arcade, our TF2 cosplay was a huge hit, Cowboy Bebop Spike vs. Vicious Marathon, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (watched a fansub and immediately fell in love)<br /><br />The Bad: Blisters on my feet from the steel toe boots, all the time wasted trying to get from point A to point B with people hounding you for photos, didn't get to do everything I wanted to on my list, maximum occupancy on the 6th floor at one point was full so there was a huge line up for the 6th floor when all I wanted to see was the Bandai panel :(<br /><br />The Expensive: 41 dollar dinner at 13 Coins but holy crap if it wasn't the best dinner I've ever had, 70 dollars for my FLCL Ultimate Boxed Set (well worth it however), spending 400 dollars the whole weekend on merch<br /><br />So I guess I'll just finish off with what I picked up at the dealer's room:<br /><br />2 Wall Scrolls (<a href=""http://www.rightstuf.com/items/2006-06/23/large/ge9654ws.jpg"">FLCL</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.rightstuf.com/items/2008-01/03/large/ge9880ws.jpg"">Haruhi</a>)<br />4 <a href=""http://www.pennyarcademerch.com/books.html"">Penny Arcade Books</a> (all signed)<br />1 <a href=""http://us.st11.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I/yhst-34640480252896_1993_757239"">Penny Arcade Portal Shirt</a><br />1 FLAG Vol. 2 DVD<br />1 FLCL <a href=""http://www.rightstuf.com/items/2006-11/10/large/spfcdvd05.jpg"">Ultimate Boxed Set</a><br />1 Haruhi Suzumiya Figure (pictured at bottom)<br />1 Yuki Nagato Figure (picture at bottom)<br />2 Evangelion Art Books<br /><br />Anyways, that's all I gotta say about that. I'm definitely 100% going back next year because I don't think 1 con a year is enough.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.rightstuf.com/items/2006-11/27/large/4545784040621.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://www.rightstuf.com/items/2006-11/27/large/4545784040621.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://images.jbox.com/f2/nagato_yuki_j51.jpg"" /><br /></a>"

<div style=""text-align: left;"">So yeah I promised that I'd do a little blurb about every game as I play and finish them so I guess now I'll talk about Portal. 

This was the game that everyone said I had to play so eventually after all the persistence I picked up The Orange Box. I was planning on getting it anyways after hearing about how great a package it was. Yeah I'm the guy who never played Half Life 2 when it first came out so this sounded like a fantastic deal.

Now that I've had the chance to sit down with Portal and play it from beginning to end, I have to say I really did love it but since certain parts were spoiled for me it didn't have as much of an impact. Don't get me wrong, I loved the game, just saw some of it coming is all. It's a fantastic puzzle/fps game. It's hilarious, GLaDOS provides most of the hilarity with the final confrontation being one of my favourites of all time. Its not too long either which is nice these days since I don't have much time to game. Not too long, doesn't overstay its welcome, but its just long enough to give you an awesome time.

What an addition to the Orange Box though, honestly this game helps the package go from great to fantastic. Easily one of the best deals in gaming at the moment.

So I guess I'll end with my favourite quote from the game, Spoilers?

the fire pit and I said 'Goodbye' and you were like 'NNOO WWAAYY', and then I

Yeah, the Wii is kicking total ass. Keep in mind the Xbox 360 had a 1 year head start, and Nintendo managed to sell almost half as many Wii's as Xbox 360's in a mere 4 and a half months.

And Sony, well...the people have spoken, and $699 is too much for a home console."

"event","Well since Mike did a little tournament wrap-up I guess I might as well too although I did absolutely horrid. I thought I was running a pretty good deck too. -_-; I just ran into way too much control and drew horribly. My little variation of R/G Gruul Deck Wins which I like to call ""Gruul FTW"" just cause it sounds better, plus it isn't a mirror deck. I like the one guy who gave me a little advice about putting some of my own control in there (Land Destruction).

Anyways, here's how the day broke down...

<u>Game 1 vs. U/W Triscuitron</u>

This guy played pretty fast which kinda bugged me but whatever, I ran with it. Anyways he just let the beats come and eventually Wrath of God'd me. Then I was left with nothing, but I did finally pull out the game. After that though I lost 2 in a row to his blasted 12 freakin' counter spells in one deck, and then he put out a Triskelavus. <b>FUN!</b>

<u>Game 2 vs. B/W Solar Flare</u>

He was nice to play with, I didn't mind him so much. But I guess that's just cause he was a nice guy (the silver haired guy at FNM all the time). He played a Solar Flare which basically tore me apart. Especially when the Angel of Depair hit the board and then he Momentary Blinked it the next turn destroying two of my permanents. I ended up with 0 lands at the end and even got Akroma'd and Adarkar Valkyried once! <b>FUN!</b>

<u>Game 3 vs. U/W Triscuitron (now with Borgardan Hellkites!)</u>

Wow, it's the Urzatron again! How fucking lovely. So i go through the motions knowing that I was going to lose again probably. And I did. He Borgardan Hellkite'd me to death, especially after Teferi hit the board and he Mystical Teachings them right into his hand. The last game I mulled down to 4 but actually came very close to beating him...but no, I lost again. <b>FUN!</b>

<u>Game 4 vs. B/W/r THE RACK! (now with Claws of Gix!)</u>

To make a long story short I actually enjoyed playing with this guy. He was nice, and he just gave off a good energy. Even if I was getting my ass handed to me, I still enjoyed it cause the deck wasn't a countermagic deck. He made me discard randomly with the Hyppie, and then Double racked me one game. Smallpoxed too. I shook his hand and then went down to Sakura Media to down my sorrows in buying xxxHOLiC and Tsubasa manga. <b>ACTUALLY KINDA FUN EVEN THOUGH I HAD MY ASS HANDED TO ME!</b>


So, I'm probably not going to City Champs again because I really had no fun at all. Back to FNM for me! And I'm definately bringing my Storm deck next time."

So Naruto finally got intersting. I downloaded and watched about 16 episodes, and they were alright but after I saw the last couple episodes of the Zabuza arc I was hooked. Can't wait to watch more, so I downloaded all the way up to episode 50. =p

I have a pretty cool/fun Magic deck almost 100% complete now, involving a lot of Storm and spells like Ignite Memories and Empty the Warrens. I know that probably doesn't make any sense to anyone but I just wanted to say it. ^_^ Wish I had more people to play Magic with, although playing with Mike, Dan and Dustin is cool.

So working at Xbox Customer Support is interesting, nothing special but it's work I suppose. Sucks that I'm gonna have to work Christmas Day...but what're ya gonna do?

Turns out I couldn't get a Wii on launch, nor will I be able to get one until after Christmas. That really sucks because I have Zelda and its just sitting there. :( Oh well, once I finally sit down and play it it will all be worth the wait. And yes, I'm open to lending it to people. And yes, certain people are allowed to even borrow the system and the game, in fact I insist. You know who you are.


Man, I can't believe how fast 2006 just flew by...I didn't even get to listen to as much new music as I had hoped I could...

Well, I'm off to read my FMA manga. Goodnight.

Let's see, I got to work at this place called Christmas Forever. A warehouse full of Christmas shit that I basically just took off the giant warehouse shelves and placed on the pallets and then lined them up to be shipped (along with 4 other people). It was actually kinda fun and I'm gonna miss the place. The work was easy and I got to drive a forklift! ^_^ 

But yeah, I have a new job starting Monday!

I'm working at the NCO Group doing customer support for XBox Live! Pretty swank I suppose.

Besides that I picked up Final Fantasy V Advance and I'm currently enjoying playing that, just as FFIII for the DS is being released and FFXII is out for the PS2. Man, too much Final Fantasy! It's gonna take me forever to play it all. Then on top of that the best Final Fantasy ever made (VI) is coming out on the GBA November 30th in Japan. Not sure about the North American release, but I'm fucking psyched.

Also picked up my reserve copy for Zelda Twilight Princess (Lisa read: You're borrowing it off me one day wether you like it or not). And I'm all set for the Wii, and to step into another epic Zelda adventure. :)

Oh, and on another good note I went on a date with that girl I met at my friends party. We grabbed some bubble tea and talked pretty much non stop for an hour and a half. She needed to get back and help her friend so I drove her back to the Skytrain and we parted ways. She got my MSN and we actually chatted a bit today. Awesome.

Yeah, Magic cards, geeky I know but damn fun to play. I have a tournament pack and two booster packs staring at me from my bookshelf. They know I want to open them, and I do, but I can't. I can't until this Saturday's sealed deck event with my buddies. Oh how they torment me! They laugh saying: ""I bet you'd love me to be a foil Psionic Blast wouldn't you?"" (For the record, that is a 60 dollar rare).

"event","Over the weekend (well, two weekends ago) I went to my second anime con and it was absolutely fantabulous. Not as great as the first time, but then what ever is as good as your first?<br><br>However, this was my first time cosplaying so that made it pretty special in its own way. In case you weren't aware I cosplayed as Roy Mustang from Fullmetal Alchemist.<br><br><span id=""_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl0_MessageView_bcMessageBody""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DAY ONE</span> <br> <br> Our first day was hectic as hell, we got to the con around 10 am or so. Jumped out of the car and we were on our way to pre-reg. Funny, the pre-reg lines took forever, while the reg. on the spot line was walk in / walk out. So much for saving 10 dollars by pre-registering... -_- <br> It was pretty damn warm so it was nice that they provided us with free fans in our bags. The bags were gigantic might I add. You could store 100 books of manga in there if you really wanted to buy that many at the Dealer's Rooms! <br> <br> Speaking of the Dealer's Rooms that's what we hit first. Unfortunately registering took too long and we missed the opening ceremonies, so the Dealer's Rooms it was. We had to stand in the long lineup, but it wasn't so bad. I saw a Havoc there and we each acknowledged each other with a nod of the head. The Dealer's Room itself was alright, full of crap to buy...but I didn't actually end up getting that much sadly. Just two volumes of Genshiken (manga), FMA Vol. 11 and a set of little japanese FMA figurines. Pics someday I'm sure... <br> <br> After that we decided to check out some Anime Human Chess. Basically the premise was everyone who participated had to cosplay, and you were essentially a chess piece. Up on stage the players would play, and the characters below would move according to their moves. If one piece took out another they would ""duel"". It was pretty fun actually, lemme post a few pics from the event. <br> </span><br><img style=""width: 361px; height: 270px;"" src=""http://img518.imageshack.us/img518/2379/dsci0117qq0.jpg""><img style=""width: 361px; height: 242px;"" src=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_0980.jpg""><img style=""width: 361px; height: 538px;"" src=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1013.jpg""><br><br><span id=""_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl0_MessageView_bcMessageBody""> Yeah, that was pretty damned entertaining. I think I'd like to participate next year if I can. <br> <br> After that I had to drive one of my friends to the Skytrain station because she wasn't staying for the whole weekend. Then after returning the whole group got together to get our townhouse in order for staying overnight and such.

Basically if you don't know the concept they have 32 guys do a runway ""walkoff"", much like in Zoolander. Do whatever the hell you want to please the crowd, and most people were in costume for it. I'll post some pics of the contestants (the third one is the ""homeless guy"", seems they were short one guy so they pulled some homeless guy off campus): <br> </span><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1205.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1205.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1228.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1228.jpg</a><br><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1256.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1256.jpg</a><br><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1291.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1291.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1298.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1298.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1292.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1292.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1442.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1442.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1566.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1566.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1626.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1626.jpg</a><br><br><span id=""_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl0_MessageView_bcMessageBody""> Well, that was all well and good...but then THIS had to happen: <br><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1703.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1703.jpg</a><br></span><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1708.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1708.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1640.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1640.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1722.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1722.jpg</a><br><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1746.jpg"">http://www.bcphotoforum.com/tempest/081906_ae_D200_1/images/DSC_1746.jpg</a><br><span id=""_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl0_MessageView_bcMessageBody""><br>Yikes. <img class=""BoardFace"" src=""http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/19.gif"" alt=""plain"" _base_target=""_top"" border=""0"" hspace=""0"" vspace=""0""> Anyways, people who went over the line (PG-13) were disqualified.

Then we went off to check out the AMV's that were in this year's AMV contest. Most of them were really uninspired, especially the ones with Simple Plan or Linkin Park songs. UGH! <br> But there were a couple gems, and if you wanna check them out I suggest trying to find a Fullmetal Alchemist one set to Terminator 2, and another called ""Lifestyles of the Animated and Fabulous"". <br> <br> We stuck around and watched some fun and upbeat videos then until we were off to watch Gantz and Puni Puni Poemy.

<span id=""_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl0_MessageView_bcMessageBody"">Yeah, so I went to my second concert last night and it was pretty ****in' fantabulous. I swear, I don't think I can honestly thank this board and its users enough for getting me into such awesome music. <br> <br> Anyways, the concert was broken down thusly: <br> <br> My friend and I arrived at the gates around 4:20 (rofl), as we headed in we were greeted by the sweet sounds of The Arcade Fire being played by the sound guys. Very nice. The venue was just beautiful. Deer Lake Park in Burnaby (look it up on Google Earth or something). So naturally the first place I went to was the merch tent and bought a Broken Social Scene shirt. My friend bought a Sam Roberts one...then we found a place, sat down, and waited... <br> <br> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jets Overhead</span> was the first band up, and they weren't really anything special. They had a couple songs I found good but not enough to really want to buy their album. Fine warm up band I suppose. <br> <br> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Stills</span> played next, from what they played I'm pretty sure the setlist was something like this (completely out of order mind you): <br> <i>Lola Stars and Stripes <br> Gender Bombs <br> Love and Death <br> Helicopters <br> Oh Shoplifter</i> <br> <br> And I'm sure there were a couple more I forgot. They were pretty damn good live, I was happy about that because I do really enjoy ""Logic Will Break Your Heart"". <br> <br> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Broken Social Scene</span> came on stage next and almost everyone stood up, although there were some stragglers that obviously didn't know how good they were. Hopefully by the end they found out though, because their show was stellar. Feist wasn't with them but they had a couple girls up there that did a great job. The songs they played (in no particular order): <br> <i>Late Nineties Bedroom Rock for the Missionaries <br> Shampoo Suicide <br> Cause = Time <br> KC Accidental <br> Stars and Sons <br> Almost Crimes <br> 7/4 (Shoreline) <br> Fire Eye'd Boy <br> Superconnected <br> Bandwitch <br> It's All Gonna Break</i> <br> <br> They did end up finishing their set with ""It's All Gonna Break"" which was ****in awesome. I kinda wished they'd played ""Our Faces Split the Coast in Half"" or ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl"", but with Feist not there I guess it wouldn't make any sense. <br> <br> Finally <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sam Roberts</span> hit the stage and the ground did go completely nuts. Naturally he was the reason a majority of the people went. He was pretty spectacular though, I have to say I really enjoyed his performance. He had a great energy on stage, and he extended many songs just to jam, which was sweet. Paranoia never sounded so good. I whole heartedly recommend any music fans here to check him out. He's one of the best Canadian rock has to offer, and I guarantee you'll enjoy him. <br> His setlist included: <br> <i>Bridge to Nowhere <br> Uprising Down Under <br> Mind Flood <br> An American Draft Dodger in Thunder Bay <br> Hard Road <br> Brother Down <br> Don't Walk Away Eileen <br> Where Have All the Good People Gone <br> Paranoia <br> With A Bullet</i> <br> <br> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Encore</span> <br> <br> <i>The Gate <br> Taj Mahal <br> </i> <br> <br> Overall the concert was just stellar, I'd give it a 9. I'm so glad I went.&nbsp;<img src=""/Images/happy.gif""></span>"

So naturally I'm pretty upset when my team loses, especially when the tournament is every 4 years. I'll admit I had a few tears well up in my eyes...<br><br>So Gary, Leo and Nav come over and we hang out, have a good time. Then the game replay pops up and Gary talks about wanting to see the goals. So I turn it off, frankly I didn't want to see it again. Nothing wrong with that right? Well apparently there is because the bastard gets all uppity and storms out of my house. Later on Nav, myself and Leo jump in the car and chase after him and he refuses to get a lift home, acting like a stubborn jackass.<br><br>I think it was the liqour because he was pretty angry and for absolutely no good reason.<br><br>Anyways I reason with him and try to explain that when you're in my house you have a little fucking respect, especially for someone that's a little dissapointed over the whole agenda at hand (the Italy Germany game). If I don't want to watch it, you can't force me to. And he went on about how I should've left the room and all this, and frankly why should I be ejected from my own room just so you can watch some highlights you could easily download from the internet or watch on Sportscentre?<br><br>Again, I attribute it to the alcohol, hopefully. Because I'd rather not lose a friend over something so trivial. Next time he needs to respect my decisions in my house, even if he doesn't like them.<br><br>*sigh* And that was my depressing day.

"event","Today was a great day.

Starting at around 2pm Gary my friend dropped by with Koala (the girl I like) and her friend Sunny. We all hopped in the car and we were off to English Bay to have some fun on Canada Day!

Well, it didn't all work out exactly as planned...it never does when Gary's around. We stopped off Granville station and grabbed some iced caps before meeting up with Leo. Then we walked for what seemed miles until we hit English Bay. Problem was Gary was supposed to meet up with some people from SFU, naturally he had no idea how to get to them so we meandered around the beaches stopping every once in awhile but to no avail...so we just hung out and eventually grabbed something to eat at Robson Sushi (which I might add was mighty delicious, best japanese restaraunt I've been to hands down!). Thanks Chris for your suggestion! It was you who told me about how good the place really was.

So after that we headed home, parted ways with Leo at Burrard and said goodbye to Sunny at Metrotown. Then Koala, Gary and I headed home a little tired but definately in good spirits. I got the chance to talk with Koala more and get to know her better, plus talking about her costume for Anime Evolution was a lot of fun. ^_^ Now she and I will be going out for dinner and a movie sometime soon...*sigh*

Great day. Best Canada Day ever."

I've been collecting games all my life, however when I was younger I did sell quite a few. Nowadays I hardly ever sell any games seeing as I always do thorough research before buying (or just buying, as is the case with ANY Zelda game).

Please, be my guest and gaze upon my 100+ game collection. Sure it pales in comparison to many I've seen, but its full of classics.

Looks like I'm losing my job. None of it is my fault of course (like last time), it turns out several people are getting the boot and a lot of the companies projects are getting outsources to places like China. Hurrah, I feel great! >_>

I just don't understand my luck, it just seems like I don't have any.

It's so ironic too, I mean I thought I was doing well for once in my life. I even saw one of my former supervisor/managers over at Superstore yesterday and he asked me how it was going and I told him well, he even commented on my looks, as in he said I looked healthy, lol. And now here I sit typing away on the keyboard at my last day of work.

*sigh* Back to square one.



EDIT: Well it seems like there is the possibility that it might not last, the being laid off thing that is. Turns out its because there's a shortage of work at the moment and I could be called back when things pick up again. To put it in context, the two ladies that work there were ""laid off"" in April. One came back 3 days later and the other 7. So I may be back in the near future, who knows.

But that isn't stopping me from applying to new jobs. If I can find something better, then so be it!"

Work has been super. Busy but good. I definately enjoy it more than I do working at Superstore and its nice to be making so much more money. The overtime hours are piling up but its just more and more money in my pocket to pay off my debt and enjoy myself (don't worry Jen, I haven't forgotten about you).

So it looks like yet another Evangelion boxed set is coming out! YIKES! The 10th Anniversary! :O Damn am I glad I didn't give into the Platinum DVDs, I almost was tempted to buy the thinpaks but I said no. Now am I ever glad! This deluxe set will cost around 250 bucks and its gonna come complete with a wicked art box, all the dvds, tons of new extras, two volumes of the manga, a JACKET! and a whole bunch of other swag. I can hardly wait. Of course this means bringing down the money I'm going to the anime con with down about 300 bucks but that's alright!

Speaking of the con, I've convinced the girl I like to come along with me to it. ;) Looks like Dustin's just gonna have to bugger off one day and go hang with the other guys or by himself. Sorry buddy. lol

Finally, today was a pretty hecktic day! :S (06/06/06!!!) Seriously though, it was really busy. At my work it was just a lot of hard work to get all these jobs done because we would have been in a lot of trouble if we hadn't done it all. And technically its not all done, so we'll see how that goes. Then mowing the lawn was a bit of a chore today, damn that fucking grass! I need a new mower.
So afterwards I went to the pop machine to grab a Pepsi and the damn thing wouldn't take my quarter. So I just kept feeding it and feeding it for about a minute until I got fed up and just pushed the coin return. All of a sudden it started raining quarters! :O  A whole 5 bucks popped out so as the coins dropped I just shoved them in my pocket. Weirdest thing ever, but I didn't complain. I just walked to the other machine, bought a pop, and walked off. Haha.

Anyways, my back hurts something fierce so I'm off to watch some anime. Later. ^_^"

It was a really nice place to work at, and sure the work was tough at times but the company made it more than worth it to dredge on at only 9 bucks an hour. Darren was a great boss (supervisor), he made the time pass by and he never interferred with my work. Lorie was good too, she was always pretty cheerful. And Dinesh and I always had something to talk about, he's a good guy.

They've had so much fucking property stolen off them it isn't even funny. Anyways, I was pretty pissed hearing that, but it turns out it isn't as bad as I thought. The Free Hand Controller can move in 3d space, while the DS3's ""tacky-add-on-at-the-last-minute"" only moves in two directions. UP/DOWN, LEFT/RIGHT. So I guess it isn't too much too worry about. Although they touted it as ""amazing new technology"", and ""innovative!"". Fuck right off Sony. Nintendo had the idea long before you.<br><br>Anyways, the fact remains that Sony is fucking dirty and I'm fucking sick of their underhanded tactics. I'm not buying a PS3, until it's really cheap for sure (sadly its the only play I can play MGS4). And if Sony somehow manages to knock Nintendo out with this move I'm giving up on videogaming for good. An industry without Nintendo isn't one I want to be a part of. Sony can go fuck a dog.<br>"

"event","The following is a bit of a rant...but frankly it needs to be said.<br><br>I'm honestly sick and tired of all the Final Fantasy VII crap. I think I've about reached my breaking point, but you know I'm sure it could be worse in other places. I don't have it so bad but frankly I'm getting sick of it.<br><br>Final Fantasy VII was an okay game. It was an alright RPG for its time and I definately enjoyed playing it...but all this praise needs to stop. I'm sick and tired hearing about how its the greatest RPG ever, and OMG! Cloud is so hot, and holy crap Sephiroth is the coolest badguy ever. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NO!!!</span> No they're not. Really! And I'm sick of Square making all this new FF7 crap when we didn't even need it. Advent Children? No. FF7 had a fine ending and it didn't need to be elaborated on. I've absolutely had it with this crap.<br><br>No praise goes directly to where its deserved the most and that's at Final Fantasy IV and VI. These two games did everything 7 did, and they did it before 7 and better than 7 could of ever hoped to have done. They are two of the most shining examples of RPG gaming one could ever play, and nobody seems to fucking realize it. Everyone just hopped on the FFVII train because it was the first one to break into the mainstream, and are blissfully unaware of the classics they're staining by giving unwarranted praise to FF7. I'm not saying FF7 was a bad game...but compared to 4 and 6...it's absolute gutter trash.<br><br>The more this happens, the more I grow to hate Final Fantasy VII, and frankly I'm feeling like we'd be better off if it hadn't existed at all. Square went in a bad direction and still hasn't returned to its glory days. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Go do yourself and favour and pick up Final Fantasy IV, it's out on the GBA now and you can even play it on the PSX too with Anthologies I believe. I promise a great RPG experience, one you won't soon forget.</span><br>

"event","So what's happened over the last little while you say? Well, not all that much actually...<br><br><ul><li>Bought Brain Age, which is helping to ""active my prefrontal cortex"" on a daily basis!</li><li>I have a new hobby in Sudoku. Brain Age hooked me on that, and it's actually surprisingly fun.</li><li>I thought my work shortchanged me...and technically they did. 15 minutes. Bastards!</li><li>Bought a couple new DVDs. Eureka Seven and PLANETES.</li><li>Went and saw SILENT HILL</li></ul><br>Silent Hill...mmm. What a perfect transformation of a videogame into a movie. This was easily the greatest videogame movie ever made. The movie is so much like the game, right down to all the little details I think the director/writer did such an amazing job doing justice to the series. It definately shows that he's a fan of the series.<br><br>I must say my two favourite things about the movie were the soundtrack and Pyramid Head. Although in the end I kinda wished there was more Pyramid Head. He's the fucking man! <img src=""/Images/shocked.gif""><br><br><br>Oh, and I may have lost a friend. But I hope he can grow up and realize that everyone cares for him, because I'd hate to lose him.<br><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000EGELP0.01-A23NLORBGXOLEO._SCLZZZZZZZ_V55474928_.jpg""><br><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0007ZEORS.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg""><img src=""http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000E3L7BE.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V56245421_.jpg""><br>"

"event","So today was nice, although I still have work tonight at 1am. Headed on over to the anime club and I was dissappointed to see that Jen and Jon weren't there. Still, it was a good time. I actually have to say its a lot nicer there then usual...wasn't so noisy...and as bad as it sounds I think I'm kinda glad Esther isn't there. I mean she was a really nice person, but I was getting a little sick and tired of all the talking. Although, that isn't all because people are still talking and being loud and obnoxious. And not only that I had brought something new once and was told we'd check it out...but then I find out some other shows were. Starting to get a little annoyed with all the goings on, a little...I really think all the talking needs to stop.<br><br>Anyways, enough about that! What else happened? Well a bunch of us headed to the food court after and I got some Butter Chicken and stuff, and a good time was had by all.<br><br>Recently I picked up the Gundam Wing collection and it's awesome. I'm really surprised by the difference between the dub and sub, wait...actually I shouldn't be surprised. The japanese language track is much better and I'm really into the show this time around. Something about it just has me more hooked. I'm glad I didn't watch the whole thing in English. Although the english track has a few high points (Scott McNeil / Kirby Morrow), there are just too many lows (especially all the extra's, their acting sounds like nails on a chalkboard).<br>

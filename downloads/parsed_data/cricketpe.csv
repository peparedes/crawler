Sadly, I'm not sure if the 'friends only' posts will make it through or not...so if you happen to post one like that, let me know so I can see if it works or not.

"event","and then I will be done with all my classes besides student teaching and student teaching seminar!!! I won't have to do anything related to school until I student teach next January! I'm not sure that I will know what to do with myself?! I've been a full time college student for EIGHT years! What will I do with all this new found time?! Oh yeah, I still have a full time job. And there's plenty of stuff that needs to be done for the wedding. I'm sure I'll have no problem staying busy.

On the topic of the wedding....I found a dress this past weekend!!! I'm sooooo excited! What a huge relief. I tried on a LOT of dresses and only liked a few of them, so I was really excited to find one I like so much :) I went with my mom and sister to look at dresses in GR. I had a ton of fun staying at my sisters; I absolutely adore my niece and nephew. Even when they're crabby (which Abby definitely was!). I had decided that we weren't going to have a flower girl at one point...but she is so darn cute...maybe I can talk my sister into letting her be one. 

We bought a dishwasher! $50 off Craigslist! You have no idea how much that appliance makes this girl happy. Troy has become Mr. Fix-It. I had no idea he had these skills, so I feel like it's this extra special bonus that I get for marrying him, lol. Since he bought the house, he has fixed the stove, the shower, the dishwasher, the dryer (well, that was at his last apt), and his dad fixed a lawn mower for us. Troy was going to work on it too, but that was the day our shower decided to quit working. Who knew he could do so much?! I am SO lucky! AND he's a really good softball player. He's been averaging a home run every game this year (I haven' t actually done the math, but it seems like it at least). I just sit on the bench (I do the stats) and grin and think..yep, that's my fiance :) 

Well, that's all I can think of for now. I only slept for about 3 hours last night because I was working on a paper, so I'm not really 100% with it today. I would love to take a nap, but I fear I would sleep through my class tonight."

"event","I've been thinking a lot about the issue of changing my last name after we're married. I don't know why, but the idea of losing my last name makes me very sad! Maybe it's because I always imagined I would be in a graduate program and be published under my maiden name, so I would keep it for that reason. While I have left the field I was in, I do have my name on a couple of presentations, and hopefully after this summer on at least one article. If I change my last name, no one would associate me with that work. Which doesn't matter a whole lots, since I don't plan on continuing to do research in that field, but still! So there's this huge part of me that wants to keep my maiden name; for those reasons and because it's ME! I love the fact that I have a huge family and sometimes people will recognize me as a relative of such-and-such. 

On the other hand, I want to have the same last name as my kids. And I don't particularly want to hyphenate their last names, that seems like&nbsp; pain. That's the same reason I don't really want to hyphenate my own name. But I don't want my husband and kids to all have one last name and I have another one; it will seem like I'm the stepmom. I've seen some couples online who will give every other child a different last name, or boys get one and girls get the other. That seems kind of silly too...I would like all my kids to have the same last name. 

I don't know what the solution is. I've thought maybe about just adding his last name to the end of mine, so it would be FirstName MiddleName MaidenName MarriedName. Then I could be like Hilary Rodham Clinton or something when I sign my name. That seems kind of like a pain as well. Who knows....it's just something I've been thinking a lot about lately."

"event","So maybe I'm just a mean old lady, but the neighbors at Troy's house are driving me NUTS! They're kids who are probably like 10-12ish are always playing in our backyard! The yard is fenced, with a gate, mind you. Apparently the caretaker for the woman who lived here before us would let them play there because their backyard is all driveway and garage. But you know what, we're new neighbors. Have a little respect for our property. And the parents just watch them do it! I think it's incredibly rude to go into a neighbors yard, ESPECIALLY since there's a fence! Troy has asked the kids to leave twice, but they are out there playing as I type this! Maybe I should just let kids be kids and not worry about it, but if these kids get hurt, I'm pretty sure we'd be liable. I don't know, the situation just makes me uncomfortable. But I also don't want to be the mean neighbors that everyone hates. The kids are great, but to go onto our property without even asking permission is just too much for me. I just think it's rude."

"event","We made a decision on catering. We decided to go with Ryke's. Hearthstone was AMAZING, but they were just too expensive and they had fewer flexible costs. We can work with Ryke's to lower the cost if we want to, whereas we're stuck with what Hearthstone gives us. Is anyone really going to notice the difference? Probably not. The food will be great regardless. 

I also might have found a dress that I like! I went with Troy's mom and sister to look at bridesmaid dresses for her (I'm letting them each pick their own dress, but the same color and designer). We were talking with the lady about my frustrations with dresses because I haven't really found one that I like. And the night before I had Troy look at some dresses and he was pointing to ones that were not like anything I'd tried on. So she brought in this one dress that was something I like and that Troy would like, wasn't strapless, and it fit perfectly! I'm waiting to see the pictures of me in it before I decide for sure, but I'm definitely leaning towards that one right now! 

Things are slowly coming together! I can't wait until classes are done when I can get more of this stuff done and out of the way!"

"event","We went to Muskegon this past weekend to meet with all potential caterers that our reception venue would allow. It went well 50% of the time. Our first meeting was with Ryke's and it went great! We sampled some appetizers, he showed us his kitchen (he was SO excited to show us his kitchen; it was cute), and then got to sample some cake and fillings too. We made a sample menu and did a budget. It was expensive, but not too much over our intended budget and I think we could get it lower if we wanted.

That afternoon we were supposed to meet with Tudor. Our appointment was at 4pm. Well, after waiting 15-20 minutes, a lady shows up and said that the woman I was supposed to meet with lost her dog and is frantically looking for it; she's in tears and can't come. But this lady didn't have keys and didn't really answer any of the questions we had either. A guy showed up saying they found the dog, but the lady was waiting for the people who took her car to look for her dog to come back, but she will be there as soon as possible. She finally got there 45-50 minutes after our scheduled appointment. She brought us in and basically didn't say anything except when I had questions. You would think that she would be trying to sell her business; telling us all the reasons we want to use her. Nope. She hardly said anything. It was almost uncomfortable because while I did have a few questions, I mostly was expecting her to do a lot of talking and to fill me in on the things I might miss. This place seemed cheaper, but after doing some calculations, we've decided that they aren't cheap enough to justify the poor business practices (only a $200 difference) so at that point, we ruled this place out.

We were supposed to meet with Sue Ann's at 10am Sunday. We got to her home office, which is where she gave me directions to, about 5 minutes early. The house looked dark, but we went and knocked. No answer. We stood around for about 10 minutes, walked around to the side door to see if maybe we should be using that one, but nothing. I tried to call the number I had, but it just rang and rang and finally beeped as if the answering machine were too full. We waited until 10:15 before giving up and leaving. Unimpressed. I had a scheduled appointment with her! We even called my mom to check the phone book to see if she had a different office we should check out. Nothing! Ugh, totally ruled her out. 

That afternoon was our last meeting. It was at Hearthstone, a VERY nice restaurant that I never even knew existed! It was great! We each got drinks and then we tasted a salad and 5 of their homemade salad dressings. They were ALL amazing. Then we got to try 4 different types of chicken with sauces, 2 types of potato, and a pasta. Delicious!! They were all so amazing. And it was a TON of food! We seriously got to eat a whole meal for free! They definitely have the best choices and were amazing! They are a little more expensive, but we have to wait until she sends me the estimate with the labor costs to see what the difference really is. They don't charge as many extras, so even with a more expensive buffet, they might be cheaper. 

So we've narrowed it down to 2. I still wish they cost half as much as they do, but I'm really excited about both of those caterers; I think we will have really yummy food at our wedding :)"

"event","It's been awhile since I posted! Since then, we had a bit of a scary incident with my new nephew. He needed a surgery when he was only 10 days old! Apparently his intestines didn't develop properly, so they were bound up and not everything was able to pass through. He started throwing up bile :-/. So they had to make an incision in his stomach, pull out his entire intestines and run their fingers along it to get rid of any kinks, then put them back in. Yuck! Apparently he was really, really lucky though because with some babies they have to remove the intestines and then they have a bag there for the rest of their life. And some have liver damage from it. And some even die! I am sooooooo happy that Micah is going to be ok; I just feel horrible for my poor sister! They're all home now and he's doing well though, so that's good!

Troy and I are going home next weekend to meet with caterers. We are doing tastings with 2 of them and just meeting with the other 2. I finally went through and filled in estimates for everything in the wedding budget and had a bit of a freakout. It was WAY over budget. We cut out some unnecessary things and cut our guest list some, so it's a little more reasonable now. It's still a couple thousand dollars more than I would like, but oh well. I thought the biggest bummer was that we're going to probably have to cut out a honeymoon until later. It makes me a little sad since traveling is my most favorite thing ever, but I'd rather have more of my friends and family there than anything. Besides, Troy's parents offered to let us go up to the condo and hang out in Traverse City, so that would still be fun. We go there all the time, but hardly every DO anything. We just stay at the condo and play video game (not my idea of a great time...) so it would be nice to actually see some fun things. Too bad it will be December because there's a ton of fun summery things I want to do up there :) I'm sure there area just as much fun wintery things though too!"

"event","I think we might be finally getting things worked out for our reception! We really wanted to have it at the <a href=""http://www.harbourtowneyachtclub.com/www.harbourtowneyachtclub.com/harbour_view_room_rental.htm"">Harbour Towne Yacht Club</a> because it's in a GREAT location. It's located right on the channel between Muskegon Lake and Lake Michigan, and I just adore the drive to it. You drive right through this cute little part of town and right by the Pere Marquette beach and the lighthouses to get to it. If we were having a summer wedding, it would DEFINITELY be great because everyone could go to the beach between the wedding and reception! We're still hoping to get some pictures at the beach because Troy and I both had a senior picture taken at the same tree there and I think it would be fun to have a wedding pic taken there as well. His cousin is a professional wedding photographer in Muskegon, so he did Troy's senior pics even though Troy lived in SE Michigan...see, we're meant to be :).<br /><br />Anyways, we were having troubles because the yacht club had been planning on putting a bigger kitchen in so that they could do their own catering, in which case, we would be required to use their catering. Considering that their liquor costs are cheaper than other places, we were hoping their catering costs would be as well. Apparently, the project plans were way over budget, so they decided to nix the idea entirely. So, since they have finally made a decision, we can book them knowing that we don't have to worry about their catering costs being unreasonable (since we hadn't seen a menu yet) and they are going to let us get an outside caterer from their list of people. We haven't filled out the contract yet, but I do believe that's where we're going to have it! They are definitely a little more than we were hoping to pay, but we absolutely LOVE the place, so I'm excited. They also can't hold quite as many people as I would like, so it may be tight and we're going to have to narrow our guest list, which isn't something I'm too excited about doing. I want everyone to come; it would be so fun!!!"

"event","My new nephew was born last Saturday, March 1 just before 3:00am. His name is Micah Robert McDonald. I went and stayed at my sister's house on Wed-Fri to help her out. I had so much fun with Abby and Micah! It made me feel much more confident with my ability to be a mom someday; I did pretty well with Micah! I even took a shift with him while Jeff and Susan slept and I did pretty well, despite the fact that he was fussy and hardly slept the entire time. I even changed a diaper by myself! 

I didn't get nearly enough done over break, but I did have a lot of fun! I tried on dresses at 2 stores; I'm so overwhelmed with dress shopping. I'm not sure why I feel so rushed to find a dress, I know I have plenty of time; maybe because that's the first thing people ask about (well, right after they ask if we have a date...). Susan said if I wait 4 weeks, she would love to go with me to try on dresses in Grand Rapids, so maybe I'll just wait till then. I trust her opinion above everyone else's and I don't feel as bad asking her to go with me like I do everyone else. I have seen some nice dresses and I know the type of styles I like, but I just haven't found one that I'm super thrilled about. Also, I despise the service at David's Bridal; I love the cheaper prices, but I think they have to be cheap in order for anyone to buy from them. It takes like 3 hours to try on 4 dresses because they are helping so many people at once, so it takes forever. 

Also, I am officially addicted to wedding blogs and all things wedding planning related. Ugh...I never wanted to be like this. But since I'm not the most creative person in the world, I've been perusing websites for ideas and I now have an entire folder of wedding blogs that I am subscribed to on my google reader. While I should have been getting a lot of work done over break; instead, I found myself going through wedding websites. Pathetic..."

"event","Troy and I went to Muskegon this past weekend; it was a lot of fun! We stopped to see a friend's new baby on the way; oh man, she was so small I was afraid to hold her! I don't remember being this afraid of Abby when she was born, but Abby was usually swaddled, so she wasn't as floppy and she seemed bigger. 

On Saturday we got to see the hall we're hoping to use for the reception. It was soooo pretty; I like it a lot! It's on the Muskegon channel and it's also really close to the Pere Marquette Beach on Lake Michigan. Too bad we're not having a summer wedding; then it would really be a ton of fun! I think it will still be really beautiful in the winter though :)

I'm a little worried about our guest list. We just have way too many people. I've been told you can assume a lot of people won't come, but I'm afraid to invite more people than the hall will hold because what if they all come?! I don't know what we would do! We've got like 50 more people than the hall will hold right now, but that's assuming everyone brings guests and kids and such, so hopefully we can get it down. 

We also went and watched my cousin play hockey in GR and hung out with a bunch of family. It was nice to see them all. We went out for dinner afterwards and had some great pizza. 

We also met the priest who is going to marry us. He was very, very nice. He talks like me; I think our wedding might be pretty fast for a Catholic wedding if he always talks like that! I think we got off pretty easy for marriage prep; in Toledo you do an all-day conference, but I think then you also meet with the priest whose marrying you a few times. Well, the priest whose marrying us said that was all we had to do, so we only have to meet with him about the actual ceremony. I'm glad it was so easy, but I'm also a little disappointed; I wanted to take the marriage inventory, I thought it would be fun to think about the things we're forgetting to think about. Oh well, at least we didn't have to go to 6 different meetings like some people I know!"

But with trying to save money for a wedding, I figured it couldn't hurt to keep working there since he pays well. I went to AA last Friday to meet with him and get some work done and got lots of very exciting news! He said he would hire me full time for the summer, which is GREAT because there's no way I'd get a job paying that much anywhere else. He also said he's going to try to give me a raise so that all of his grad student employees are making comparable amounts. Hooray for that! So perhaps saving for the wedding won't be as bad as I keep thinking. Maybe we'll even get enough money to be able to go on a honeymoon, which is by far what I am most excited about. Yay trips!"

I thought since I was only staying one night, taking the train would be easier and more relaxing than driving. It went ok, but it was so cold that the cars were frozen, so we left much later than scheduled. Then it had to drive really slow because the weather was so bad. However, I got back to Toledo only a little over 2 hours later than expected; at around 2am. 

So then Troy is driving me to my apartment and we got into a car accident. Some man driving a minivan taxi decided to either turn right from the left lane or change lanes or something just as we were driving by him. Fortunately, Troy is an excellent driver and managed to keep us on the road and not into a light pole, but the side of my car is all dented in now. So we had to wait for the cops to come and everything. No one was hurt or anything, and Troy and I actually joked around quite a bit while we were waiting for the cops to finish all the paperwork, but it was around 3:30am when I got home. I didn't get to sleep until at least 4am. I'm sleepy now.

Although, now that I'm home she's just out playing in the living room, so I guess she didn't miss me that much. 

We went to our pre-cana (marriage prep) class yesterday. It was a nice program, but it was very, very long. We were there from 8:15am till 5pm-ish. I think it might be better if they had split it into two days because I was pretty burnt out by the end of it. We compared answers on some questionnaires, learned about money, lots of pretty common sense stuff about how important communication is, heard couples who had been married a long time talk, learned about wedding music, and more. The other couples who were at our table were pretty fun, so we had a good time. We went to a friend's friends' house to watch the Super Bowl immediately after pre-cana. What an exciting game! It seemed faster than normal too, which I definitely appreciated. 

I might be going to visit Rosie this weekend. She is going to be in Chicago. I can't leave until Friday night at the earliest though and that is if I completely miss celebrating Troy's birthday. So we'll see how it will work out. It would be nice to see her because I don't get to see her often and she wants to help with wedding stuff, but I'm also very behind in everything and am not sure how to make it all work."

I really like the house, although there are lots of little projects to work on which I'm kind of excited about. We got a really nice note from the daughter of the previous owner, she told us that her father built this home in 1954, so we are only the 2nd owners of the house and she hopes we love it as much as they did. It made me feel a little sad for her, because I imagine moving all the stuff out of her childhood home was difficult, especially since the reason they had to do that is because their mother passed away. It was very nice of her though. 

Also, I think I might be taking on a little too much this semester. I'm taking 5 classes, as well as doing GA work at UT and also doing work for Sushil at UM; each are supposed to be about 20 hours of work a week. I am also tutoring for physics twice a week (about 5-6 hours total). And I am trying to plan a wedding. I have NO idea where I am going to find the time to get all this done, but here's hoping I'm able to! I also subbed last week at St. Clement.

I'm subbing this whole week for my cooperating teacher from my methods class last semester. She was going on an anniversary trip for the week, so she asked if I would sub since I already know the kids and I actually have a background in math and science, which most subs don't. Well.....I'm exhausted. I've only subbed for 2 days, but this is the first time I've actually taught for entire days. I only taught one class during methods. The teaching is fine; the kids are great, they're behaving well (because I know them well enough to call them out when they don't) and overall it's great. But I am definitely NOT used to getting up this early anymore. Or standing that long in dress shoes. I wish dress shoes were more comfortable. I'm definitely going to have to invest in some more comfortable shoes when I student teach. 

This past weekend was super busy! Friday I drove around doing all sorts of errands. I registered for a church that right by the house that Troy's buying. I also got us signed up for marriage prep; they do it very differently in Ohio. We just go for one day and that's it. They only do it 4 times a year, so we're going to the one in two weeks so we can get it done. Hopefully it will be fun!

I drove to Grand Rapids on Friday night and met my sister for dinner. I was planning on going to Muskegon, but they got hit by so much snow that I ended up staying the night in GR. It was snowing so bad that we even decided to leave my car at the restaurant and have her drive us both so I could help her make sure she was staying on the road. Hooray for rumble strips, because you couldn't see a thing. Of course, since I stayed at my sister's house, my niece decided it would be a good day to wake up at 5:30am crying like crazy. My sister says she's normally great, but I swear she's bad every time I stay there, lol. She sure is cute though. I finally got her to say my name; she calls me ""Pappy"". I feel like I should be a grandpa. I supposed t's might be a little difficult at this point.

Saturday my mom and sister went to a bridal show. I was hoping to get price sheets from a lot of places in one place so I could hopefully save time later. I definitely got a lot of info, now I just need to sit down and do some calculating. I wish weddings were just a little more inexpensive. Oh well, it will work out I'm sure! I decided to drive partway back to Toledo on Saturday night, so I stayed at Monique's apartment in East Lansing. I had a TON of fun. Brett and Monique's sister were over, so we just chit chatted a bunch all night long. My brother was visiting a friend at MSU, so he stopped over for awhile too. On Sunday I went with Troy to a Magic prerelease tournament in Garden City. We played as a team in the main event and ended up getting 6th place! I was pretty excited; I had a lot of fun. 

Well, this was way longer than necessary. Time for bed; I'm still exhausted."

We'll pass along more information as we figure it out :) <br /><br />Troy's e-mail to co-workers:<br /><br />To those that are interested, I have a small  announcement to make.&nbsp; I bring this news to you, not to ellicit the women's  congratulations and the men's condolences, but rather because half of you would  kill me if I kept it a secret.&nbsp; </span></font></div> <div><font size=""2"" face=""Arial""><span></span></font>&nbsp;</div> <div><font size=""2"" face=""Arial""><span>This past Sunday I  got engaged to my girlfriend, Patty, who got so excited she&nbsp;can now hardly  remember the incident.&nbsp; I am not sure she noticed that I was holding a  ring, because she gave me a huge hug and said ""Of course!""&nbsp; I had to pry  her off me a few minutes later so I could make her look at and try on the darn  thing.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I was asked by my friend's wife what the ring looked like,  and though I picked it out and remembered it exactly, I was at a bit of a loss  when she didn't like my reply.&nbsp; ""It is silvery...and sparkly...and had a  bunch of diamonds on it!""&nbsp; So feel free to ask me any other  questions.&nbsp; Also, the wedding is tentatively scheduled for this November or  December, and will probably be in Muskegon, MI.&nbsp; No other details have been  decided on at this point, but we are excitedly working on them.&nbsp;  </span></font></div>"

"event","The semester is finally done!! I am so glad to be able to relax a little bit. I still have some GA stuff to do, but I'm done with all my classes. I'm going to Ann Arbor on Monday and it sounds like I am going to be handing all my research stuff at UM over to the new post-doc. As much as I like the income I get from there, I will really be glad to finally be completely done with all that stuff. I hope to spend next week finishing up all those loose ends and then finally cleaning my apartment; it's a disaster right now. 

Troy has been looking at houses to buy. I am very torn on how I feel about that. I know it makes sense because I know he has a good job with good benefits and until he gets more experience, it makes sense for him to stay and work in Toledo. But I know that as long as we stay together, that means I will end up staying in Toledo too. Toledo's not bad, it's just not a place I thought of as somewhere I'd stay for long. I thought more about it as a place I would get my teaching certificate and then move somewhere else. I get kinda depressed when I try to think of Toledo as ""home"". Hopefully once I get a job and make some friends here I will like it more. Let's hope at least, otherwise it's going to be a long 5-10 years."

"event","Wow, I've totally neglected writing in this thing. I still check it almost daily to see what my friends are up to, but never take the time to write what I'm up to! It's been a VERY busy semester. I'm taking 4 classes (which really aren't that bad), doing 2 field placements (getting over 200 hours in the classroom), working as a grad assistant at UT, and still continuing some of my research from U. Michigan. It isn't as bad as it sounds, but I always feel like I have a gazillion more things to work on. For one of my field placements I had to teach a class for 3 weeks. It was the first time I've actually taught in a classroom. I was very nervous, but it went very well. I was lucky in that I was placed in a very small Catholic middle school and only had 14 students in my classroom. I'm glad my first teaching experience went so well though because it definitely built my confidence and made me feel really good about my decision to leave the Ph.D. program for teaching. I definitely think I made the right decision, but I guess we'll really be able to tell when I get my own classroom. 

I've still found time to have some fun this semester though! This past weekend I met Troy out in Las Vegas; he was there the previous week for a conference and flew me out to spend the weekend with him. We had a great time, we saw a Cirque du Soleil show, went to the Tournament of Kings medieval dinner show, and wandered the strip. It was definitely exhausting, but tons of fun! We also went to all but 1 of the UT football games this semester because we have season tickets. We were able to go to the Notre Dame vs. Michigan game in Ann Arbor too; we were disappointed that Notre Dame lost, but did enjoy watching people step in the puke from the drunk girl a couple rows behind us. Seriously people, watch where you're walking! 

Well, it's definitely about time for bed; I just thought I'd update since I noticed how long it's been!!"

"event","It's been almost a month since I posted in here. I just discovered the coolest thing ever! Something my English major friends might especially enjoy!!! This website (www.dailylit.com) is so neat! They have a whole bunch of books, mostly classics, and you can sign up to have a small portion of it sent to you through e-mail or RSS feed every day. What a great way to read books for people who are too busy to find time! And you can read it quicker than what they e-mail them to you by requesting the next entry right away. I am going to read Emma first; I've always wanted to read that :)

And on that note, if you are a fan of RSS feeds, which I've never used before, I discovered Google Reader today. So cool! I love everything google and I'm subscribed to a Google Educator discussion group and they have tons of ideas for ways to use Google Reader, Google Notebook, etc in the classroom. Granted, this is assuming your classroom has technology, which I know is rare, but I really find their ideas fascinating. Anyways, Google Reader lets you keep track of a bunch of RSS Feeds in one program that you can view from any computer and it will show you what you have/haven't read and it updates automatically. And if you download Google Gears, you can view Google Reader offline, so you can read through them all on your own time, even if offline. 

Ok, enough on all the new technology things I've discovered, I was just so excited. In other news, I got a new phone because I lost my old one (and everyone's phone numbers too, so please give me yours!!). I got one of the new version Chocolates, for free because I was eligible for the New Every Two thing. I like it a lot. I found a program that lets me sync my Google Calendar to my phone so I have my calendar with me all the time, which I love. Crap, I got back to talking about technology stuff again, lol. 

I finished my Education classes for the summer; I really liked them a lot. I start full time on August 20; way too early for classes in my opinion. I'm excited to get started, but also wish I had more of a break from school over the summer. Oh well, I'll be done soon enough!!!"

Troy found out he could get Thursday and Friday off work, so we left Tuesday night after my class and headed to Traverse City to spend time with his family at their condo up there. We mostly just hung out there until Friday when we drove to Muskegon to go camping with my family. There was lots of relaxation and hanging out and it was great!

This weekend is going to be even better!!!!! I am flying out to Colorado on Thursday morning to visit Rosie for her birthday!! Dusti and Paulie will be there too. I'm so excited to see NMU friends, I miss them so much! It should be great times, I wish I was going to be there longer so I could see more of Colorado, but I'm mostly excited about just seeing friends for this trip. The last (and only) time I was in Colorado was when I was 8 years old and went to visit my Aunt Bev with my sister Susan. My Aunt passed away when I was in high school, so I have to admit the idea of going to Colorado makes me a little sad, but I'm still incredibly excited."

"event","This past weekend was a ton of fun. On Friday Troy and I made a last minute decision to go scuba diving because we realized we actually had a free Friday and that's when the dive shop does Friday night fun dives. We decided to buy dive computers because they make diving a lot more fun and hassle-free. The water was pretty darn cold, the surface temp was ok, but when you got below 20 feet it was like 50-55 degrees. We had wetsuits and hoods, but not gloves, so my hands were freezing. I think it will be worth it to buy some gloves of my own. We had a great time though and now I can't wait to go again. 

Saturday was uneventful; I spend the day doing laundry at Troy's place where it's free. On Sunday we went to the Toledo Zoo with John and his girlfriend Kelly. So fun! I love going to the zoo :) We saw pretty much the entire thing, but we didn't get to see the polar bear cubs because there was a really long line and we decided to spend more time seeing the other animals. After that Troy and I drove up to Utica where we met up with Dane and Barb for dinner and video games at Dave &amp; Busters. Another former Mountain House resident was there as well. We had enough tickets leftover from the last time we went there (Amanda's wedding) to get 2 beer glasses, which was pretty fun. 

Good times were had! Now back to work and school :("

"event","I moved into my new apartment yesterday! Oy, it was a long day. Rob and Amanda helped me load in Ann Arbor and Troy's family helped unload in Toledo, which was wonderful, because I had enough stuff to thoroughly stuff a 16 foot Budget moving truck. Ugh. Pudge didn't like the move very much, she was so nervous last night that she had diarrhea that stuck all over her fluffiness, so Troy had to take a shower with her last night at 1am. She does like the big windows with sills that are the perfect size for her to sit on though. I really like my apartment, but it's a huge mess right now. 

I'm not a fan of Uhaul. I didn't know how their whole reservation thing worked, but I made my truck reservation online last Monday (to use yesterday). Last minute, I know, but since it let me make a reservation, I assumed I would be able to find a truck within a reasonable distance from where I lived. Well, they don't tell you where you have to go to get it until sometime before 6pm the day before you need it. They wanted me to go to Inkster, MI to get a truck, which is 40 minutes away according to google maps. That sort of defeats the purpose of saving gas money when I have to drive almost as far as I'm moving just to get the truck. So I called to see if there was anywhere closer, etc and the lady got snotty with me about how it's first come first serve and I just made my reservation on Monday. That's fine, I understand, but it would have been nice to know earlier that I would have to drive so far, so that I could shop around for trucks with other companies. So I called around and Budget had a truck 2 miles from my place in Ann Arbor. So I called the place I was supposed to pick up the truck to cancel and that lady got all snotty with me because ""google maps lies, it only takes 25 minutes from Ann Arbor). That may be true, depending on WHERE in Ann Arbor you live, and either way, 25 minutes is still 50 minutes total of driving my car there and back to pick UP the stupid truck. I wasn't impressed. Then right after I got off the phone with her, snotty lady #1 called me back and was like, ""You cancelled?!"" Darn right I cancelled! I&nbsp; found a truck right by me for the same price with a different company! So, moral of the story, either make your reservation with Uhaul super early, or use a company like Budget because they treated me very nicely and had a truck ready for me 15 hours before I needed to get it. 

The TA position isn't what I thought it would be. It's not a TA position at all; the lady said she's not going to have me teaching at all. I won't even ever go to the class. All I'll do is find her articles and do other stuff she doesn't want to do to help her prepare for her class. I wasn't very thrilled. The whole reason I decided to go to UT was so because of the TA position and the opportunity to get college teaching experience. Oh well. I started my first education class last week. I like it a lot, but it's only 2 weeks long and we have to read 2 books during that time. I am almost done with the first one, but have barely started the second. It wouldn't be so bad if all we had to do was read, but we also have to do lesson plans, etc; and the class meets from 9am-2pm, so it doesn't give you a ton of time to work in the evenings either."

I'm not sure what I'll be doing or teaching or anything yet, but they're short a faculty member right now, so they really need help. I'm really excited about the opportunity to get some college teaching experience!! In this program, I will get my M.Ed. (or maybe Ed. Specialist since I already have a Masters) while i'm getting certified, so then if I really like education stuff, it would be easier to get a Ph.D. if I wanted to be a math ed professor. I'm super excited. 

I also was apartment searching like crazy this past week. I think I finally found the place I'm going to get. It costs a little more, but I'm really really excited about it. It's close to downtown Toledo and it's in a 13-floor building that used to be a hotel. The apartment is a 1-bedroom on the 8th floor. One whole wall of the living/dining room and bedroom is just huge windows. I think it will be really fun! It's just short drive to downtown where there are lots of fun restaurants and the Mudhens stadium. I'm not moving for another month, but I'm really excited about it! The only downside is that it doesn't have a dishwasher, but I might buy a used portable one because of my eczema my hands have a hard time with dish soap. 

So hooray! Lots of fun :)"

I decided to enter the teacher education program at Siena Heights University. It's a pretty nice, quick program. I will only have one class this summer; it meets once a month on a Saturday. Then this fall I will spend 2 days a week in the classroom and have a night class that meets twice a week. Then in the winter I will student teach while taking another night class. So by May 2008 I should be certified to teach secondary education math and physics. I'm really excited, but worried because while I have a job for the summer, I'm not sure what I'm going to do after that. I'm sure it will all work out though :)"

"event","I have become the most lazy person in the entire world. I know I don't need any more classes for my degree at UM, so I just don't feel like doing anything anymore! Oh well, I justify it by reminding myself that starting this summer I'm going to be taking a ton of classes, so I deserve a break. Or something like that.

I've been looking at apartments in Toledo to see if I can find one for July that's reasonably priced. I don't know why I feel like I need to look 6 months ahead of time, but it sure is a good way to put off doing real work. I'm trying to convince Brett to move to Toledo and be my roommate because it would definitely be cheaper to get a 2 bedroom place, but I'm looking at 1 bedrooms as a back up since I don't know how keen Brett is on the idea of moving. I visited a 1 bedroom yesterday and wasn't super impressed. It was ok, but I've just gotten spoiled at my current apartment because it's super nice. Ah well, I'll keep looking and see what I find."

We heard Walmart was going to release some on Sunday morning, so on Saturday night we went to the one that is open 24 hours that is right by Troy's place and got the LAST ticket that they gave out! So of course, all day Sunday was spent playing it. It's definitely a lot of fun :)"

We were out and about doing some shopping, so we found 3 geocaches while we were out. Seriously, it's a good time, you should try it. I've been using www.geocaching.com but there are a bunch of other gps games sites. They have it so you can download google earth and then see where there are geocaches that you can find...I was finding them all over the world tonight. I know what I'm doing on my next vacation :)"

"event","It's been awhile since I posted again. Not too much is going on. School has started. I decided to take only 2 classes this semester, so I'm taking Thermodynamics and Space Instrumentation. The Space Instrumentation class is pretty cool because we're designing, building, and launching a weather balloon. Hooray for something hands-on!! Troy is helping me out a lot with that class, which is kinda fun too. 

So in exciting future life change news: I've decided to leave the Ph.D. program at Michigan. I know that a Ph.D. in space science isn't going to lead me to what I want to do in life, it's too research oriented. I don't want to spend my life doing research and sacrificing my family, friends, and personal life to the extent necessary to be a successful planetary scientist. So I'm going to graduate in April with my Masters Degree! I originally had no intention of walking at graduation, but Bill Clinton is the commencement speaker, so I'm tempted to just because I think it would be neat to hear a former president speak. I haven't decided yet though, so we'll see. 

I'm planning on entering a program to get my teaching certificate at the University of Toledo. If I'm going to switch programs, I might as well do it by moving to Toledo so I can be closer to Troy! UT has a really neat licensure program for people who already have degrees where you get your teaching certificate and M.Ed. in less than 2 years. And since I will already have my M.S., they said I would get an Educational Specialist degree instead. I could potentially be student teaching by next January, but depending on money and whether I decided to get certified in both physics and math, I may take longer. 

UT also has this really neat UT3 program where, for every year you are in the program, if you teach at a high-needs school, they forgive 1 year of your student loans. Sounds like a great way to finance my education to me! They also help you get a paid internship while you're in schoool and they were really excited about my background because they have a space mission simulator program that they thought I would be perfect to work at. They also said I might be a good person to help out with summer science camps that they do or to help make shows for the planetarium. I was really excited about it :)

So things are going pretty well :)"

"event","My dad got out of the hospital yesterday finally. We're doing our sibling Christmas this Saturday, so it's nice that he'll be out by then. He's still having some minor problems, but hopefully they'll all get fixed eventually. Troy and I stayed at my dad's last night to help take care of him. 

Troy and I had a good time in Traverse City with his family. We didn't do anything too exciting, just hung out most of the time. There was no snow up there, which was quite disappointing. 

We left to come to Muskegon on Christmas Day, spent most of the night at the hospital with my dad and had dinner at my mom's house. The day after Christmas we went to Kalamazoo for Troy's family's  extended family Christmas. All were good times. 

Troy is the winner as far as presents are concerned. He got me a handheld GPS, so now I can go geocaching. I decided shortly after moving to Ann Arbor that it would be a fun way to go hiking because there aren't nearly as many fun hiking places as there were in Marquette. It's like a treasure hunt, so I can't wait to try it out."

"event","My dad is back in the hospital again. They checked his chest x-ray at his last appt and admitted him immediately because he had fluid in his lungs. They've already drained at least 1.3 L. Craziness. Hopefully this will be the reason he's had such a hard time breathing and hopefully if they fix this he'll be lots better. He gave them a scare this morning though because he's on morphine for pain and they gave him a sleeping pill last night because he has trouble sleeping at the hospital, but apparently he wouldn't wake up this morning. His breathing got really shallow and he wouldn't respond even when they were shaking him to wake him up. Apparently they got him awake at some point, but they took him off the morphine and all painkillers. He did say it was the best sleep he had gotten in a long time, but I hope he never sleeps that well ever again! 

I am SO jealous of Annika and Monique and all you other people who are done with school already and get such long breaks! My last final isn't until next Wed and I have enough research and stuff I need to get done that I'm going to stay until Friday at least. Then I start classes on Jan 4, so we get less than 2 weeks off pretty much. Sucks. I miss the 4 weeks off we got at NMU. Even my older sister who teaches high school gets more time off than me. So not fair."

"event","Troy and I got back from Hawaii tonight! We had such a great time. I'll post pictures to my photo website later sometime, but a quick rundown of some of the highlights:

-went SCUBA diving, had so much fun we decided to go a second time; we saw white-tipped reef sharks, tons of green sea turtles (HUGE ones!), a hawksbill sea turtle (not native to that area; the first our dive master had ever seen in Kauai), a baby green sea turtle (so cute!), lobsters, eels, and tons of other fish and coral. 
-went on a helicopter ride around the island, the helicopter had no doors, it landed at a waterfall only accessible by helicopter where we had lunch and went swimming
-explored all the cool places on the island that we wanted to see, saw tons of waterfalls, some caves, Waimea canyon, and lots of beaches
-got to see lots of friends: Sandy, Amanda, Dusti, Jeff, Kelly, Ociel, Auntie Kai, Uncle Norm and the rest of Jeff's family including most of the people I met when I stayed on the Big Island
-got to watch Jeff's family put the pig in the Imu for the luau
-had Thanksgiving on the beach; spent the whole day there and bbq'd for dinner too
-got to be a Hawaiian princess for a day; Auntie Kai made us dresses for the wedding mass and luau (well, not a wedding since they're already married, but same idea) and got to wear a haku (a lei for your head)
-got to see how incredibly talented Jeff's family was, the luau was basically a bunch of performances including some hula dancing and lots of music and singing

I'm sure I left some stuff out, but overall it was a great time. I'll let you know when I've put the pictures on my website (be patient though, I must get caught up with school first)"

"event","After some very rough times traveling, we finally got to Kauai this morning. Wow was it an adventure getting here though. Our flight in San Francisco got delayed by an hour and a half, so we missed our connecting flight in Honolulu. We had to wait in line forEVER to get our new booking and we were going to have to wait until the next morning. They did put us up in a very nice hotel near Waikiki (although we got in so late and left so early we didn't get any time to enjoy it) and gave us each $13 for food, as well as taxi vouchers for travel to and from the airport. After we got to the airport this morning, we had a ton of problems with the e-ticket check-in and then found out that we didn't have seats assigned to us on this flight, but that the person at the counter where we boarded would tell us. We did end up getting seats, that were even exit row seats, so that ended up being very nice. Then after we got to Kauai, we had to wait over an hour in line to get our car rental. Mind you, there were only THREE people in front of us. Someone needs to work on efficiency at that place. However, they were out of the type of car we rented, so we were upgraded to a convertible. Not bad!!! Then we found out that it was a PT Cruiser convertible. Still a convertible, so it's awesome, but undoubtedly the ugliest convertible ever, in my opinion. Beggers can't be choosers though, so we'll take it. After we got to the hotel, we had problems checking in because we were supposed to check in last night. I called the hotel last night to explain the situation and talked to someone and they said they would write a note and let them know. Well, whoever I talked to apparently wasn't really a front desk person because no men were working and no note was written, so we had been shown as no-shows. I explained that I did indeed call. The only problem was that they had given our room away and no garden view rooms were available. So instead, we were upgraded to an ocean-view room! Not bad! So while it was a challenge getting here, we are settled and enjoying ourselves. Troy is looking up some info about helicopter and diving tours now, then we're heading out to check things out!"

"event","Even a funeral is good times with the Egeler's. Troy and I went up to Traverse City LATE Thursday night so we could go to my Uncle Fred's funeral on Friday morning. The funeral was really nice, people told some really funny stories about Uncle Fred. My uncle was in the military, so during the burial they did the 21 gun salute (perhaps fewer guns, i didn't count) and gave my aunt a flag. That was the first time I'd seen that, it was very nice, though the guns pointing over our heads made me nervous even though they were shooting blanks. After the funeral, there was a luncheon at Peegio's because my uncle was friends with the owner, in fact the owner paid for the entire luncheon. It was a lot of fun and I got to see tons of Egeler's. After that Troy and I met up with his grandparents for dinner before meeting back up with my brother and cousin to have some drinks for Uncle Fred. We went to 2 bars at Grand Traverse Resort and another one near there. We had a really good time. 

On Saturday we did some wine-tasting and bought some wine before heading down to Muskegon. We went straight to the hospital and hung out with my dad for awhile. Then we went back to my mom's house and went to bed. Sunday morning I got my picture taken with my cousins to give to my mom and aunt as a Christmas gift (one of my aunt's is paying for it as her gift to our parents). So we shopped a little at the mall and had lunch before going back to the hospital to see my dad again. He's doing pretty well, though not as well as he thinks he should be doing. Apparently his pneumonia has gotten a little worse, so he's really frustrated with how difficult it is to breathe."

"event","One of the major worries with my dad's surgery was leaking where they reattached my dad's stomach to his esophagus. Today they did a scan after they made him drink some sort of a tracer that would show any leaking and it appears there isn't any at all!! Somehow my dad made it through this surgery where there's almost a guarantee of complications with no complications that we know of so far!! I'm so excited. He's still in ICU, hopefully he'll get moved to a regular room soon, but at least he has good care while he's in ICU. 

I managed to get my meetings and such rearranged so I can go to my Uncle Fred's funeral on Friday morning. I'm not sure if Troy and I are going to head to Traverse on Thursday night or super early on Friday, but we're going for sure. It will be nice to see family, despite the sad reason for the gathering.

And my Uncle Fred passed away Tuesday morning, so I'm trying to figure out how I can leave here early enough to be in Traverse City for the funeral on Friday. My dad is still in ICU, so he won't even be able to go to one of his favorite brothers' funeral. He is still doing well for the most part though, they're slowly removing tubes from him. Oh! I have some pictures of my sister and I with my dad the morning after his surgery if you want to see them. On a happier note, I had dinner with Monique and Monique from NMU last night. They were in town from Lansing to see a concert. It was definitely nice seeing them. 

I did have a good weekend (which is part of the reason that very little homework got done). Friday I went to Toledo so that Troy and I could meet with the travel agent about Hawaii (one week from Friday!!!!). Then on Saturday we drove back up to Ann Arbor to go to the UM vs. Ball State game with Dan and a friend. Then we just hung out for the most part that night. On Sunday I had to meet with my adviser and then Troy surprised me to celebrate the fact that we've been dating for a year. He got me a very nice necklace and then took me out to dinner at The Chop House, which was way fancier than any place I've ever been. After dinner we got dessert (my treat after the expensive dinner) at La Dolce Vita which is the dessert bar/restaurant attached to The Chop House. Then we went to the movies and saw Borat, which definitely contained a few scenes that I could have done without EVER seeing, lol. It was a lot of fun; that boy spoils me far too much :)."

"event","So I just realized that I hadn't updated this about my how my dad's surgery went. It went as well as could be expected. Last Wednesday was a LONG day; we were at the hospital for 14 hours. I actually saw someone I graduated with though, so that was kinda fun. My dad did very well through the surgery, although they had to keep him on the ventilator overnight, which made communication quite a challenge that night. 

Since then, they've taken the ventilator and quite a few tubes out of him. He's even been out of bed a few times and walked to the nurses station and back at least once. He's still in ICU because they're watching his heart rate and blood oxygen levels. His surgeon has said that so far there is no sign of leaking (one of the major concerns after the surgery) thus far. I believe either later this week or next week they will do some more tests to see if there is any leaking though. But so far he's doing pretty well!

Also, they got the pathology reports back. The chemo and radiation had completely removed the tumor in his esophagus. Also, they found no cancer cells in his esophagus or in the lymph nodes that they checked. It doesn't mean the cancer is completely gone, but it's a very good sign!!!"

My dad is going to have his esophagectomy next Wednesday. In all my stress from school, I haven't really had time to worry about that yet. I guess the surgery is actually really invasive, they're removing 2/3 of his esophagus and then moving part of his stomach up to connect it to the remaining esophagus. He's doing really well with everything, so hopefully everything will go just fine, but now I'm starting to worry about it (like I always do). His regular surgeon is doing the surgery, but they're even having a surgeon from Detroit come just for my dad's procedure. Finding that out I think is what finally made me realize how serious this surgery is. I thought we were home-free after his last surgery, but now we just have to make it through one more!

I'm trying to decide what I should do as far as going home and such. Next week is actually not too bad in terms of homework and such. I'm thinking that I might go home on Sunday so that I can spend a few days with him before the surgery and then stay through the following weekend, so that I can help out with everything after the surgery. It's on a Wednesday, so I would want to stay at least through Thursday and at that point, I might as well stay for the weekend."

It was pretty fun, but I got nervous a lot because the visibility was really bad and I had a hard time staying with the group. The first thing we did was our skills with the instructor on the wings of an airplane. Bob (the instructor) took me down first because I was sick and was worried my ears wouldn't pop. Troy was supposed to come down right after me, so I thought he would be next to me on the plane. So while we were down there, I would get nervous and hold his hand and whatnot. Well, turns out, the guy next to me wasn't Troy at all. Talk about embarassing!! I still don't know who it was next to me. Ah well. It was a good time. We did 3 dives and we're doing 2 more tomorrow. Should be fun!

Yesterday we went to another wedding for a guy Troy works with. It was outside, so it was pretty cold, but the reception was nice and warm. Troy went up with some other guys he works with and when Paul threw the garter, everyone moved away, so Troy felt bad and picked it up. They had the girl put the garter on his leg. She knew he had a girlfriend there, so she was nice for the most part; she did use her teeth at one point, but then she apologized afterwards. It was pretty funny; all the guys kept apologizing to me because he took one for the team. Good times were had though!"

And it was the first time in 2 years that Rosie, Sandy, Amanda, and I have been together and the first time in at LEAST 3 years (maybe more, I'm not even sure) that all of us and Dusti have been together. It was a riot. Pictures will be posted later sometime on my smugmug site, but I haven't had time to download them yet. 

Some highlights: 
-Auntie Kai (Kelly's mom) asking Troy if he was coming to Hawaii for the reception so that she could grill him to make sure he was good enough for me and continued to give us a hard time (teasingly) all night long :)
-Kelly's grandma talked to me about Hawaii the whole time during the rehearsal and invited us to come anytime we want even after the reception
-Amanda's sister Audrey, who is VERY ill was released from the hospital with a nurse for the day so that she could be in the wedding. Almost everyone in the church cried as her cousin pushed her down the aisle. 
-Someone announced that the Tiger's were going to the World Series and everyone cheered loudly during the reception
-drinking a glass of $500 champagne because I was at the head table
-the server at the head table, Maggie, was AWESOME. Rosie loved the mushrooms and asked Maggie to bring any extras, so she stole the meat plate from the groomsmen and dumped all the mushrooms on Rosie's plate :)
-going to Dave & Buster's after the rehearsal and again before we left on Sunday
-going to a bar with the whole wedding party and friends between the wedding and reception and starting to drink at 4pm
-seeing lots of NMU people and reminiscing about the great times in Marquette
-talking with Kelly's parents (Auntie Kai & Uncle Norm) and Jeff about the Hawaii trip 2 years ago and being blamed repeatedly for Amanda and Kelly meeting each other
-talking with Jeff about all the great times at Notre Dame
-partying until 1am when the reception ended, even though I was tired by 9pm
-wearing 2 in spiky heels and everyone laughing at me as I attempted to walk, then having BLACK feet by the end of the night, because they didn't last long once the reception started
-Amanda's dad coming back to the reception after taking Audrey home and seriously boogying (sp?) down! It was hilarious :)

And the sad part: Saying good-bye to some of my best friends because who knows when we'll all be together again :("

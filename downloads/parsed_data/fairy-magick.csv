spanish eyes 
 
I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back, I know he cannot see
My hands trembling, I know he hears me sing

[Chorus:]

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand; at least he was a man

[chorus]

[Intermediate:]

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall

[chorus]

[Spoken:]

Tus lagrimas de tristeza
No me dejan olvidarte
Your tears of sadness
Will not let me forget you

Sunday best and broken glass 
Broken down from the bikes and bars 
Suspended like spirits over speeding cars 
You and me were kings over the parkway tonight 
And tonight will go on forever while we 
walk around this town like we own the streets 
and stay awake through summer like we own the heat 
Singing ""everybody wake up (wake up) it's time to get down"" 
(everybody, everybody wake up its time to get down) 
And when I pass the bottle back to Pete 
on the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh 

I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (cut me open) 
So we can stay like this forever (sun poisoned) 
And we'll never miss a party (this offer...)
cause we keep them going constantly (...stands forever)
And we'll never have to listen (new haircut) 
to anyone about anything (new bracelet) 
cause it's all been done and it's all been said (eyeliner) 
we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get

The hell out of this town 
Find some conversation 
The low fuel lights been on for days 
It doesn't mean anything 
I've got another 500, 'nother 500 miles 
before we shut this engine down, 
we shut it down

Eighteen forever (first kisses)
(your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation) 
So we can stay like this forever (new stitches)
(you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed) 
And we'll never miss a party (collar weekend)

I've just completed three dance exams and am totaly exhausted. I think Im going to have a very last minute circle tonight with my closest friends from the coven. Oh, today me, nez, leany and oona had a big converstaion while we were waiting for the bus. We were telling each others good points and bad points it was funny. Oh well better go get prepared for tonight.

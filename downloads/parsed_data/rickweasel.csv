"event","Sorry if I cant post this here but we are in need of some high school extras&nbsp;for our feature length independent coming of age comedy &quot;The Backseat.&quot; These scenes shoot in Lawrence, Bayside, and Dix Hills. Extras don&#39;t need to be available each of these days, but full availability is a plus and betters your chance at getting serious screen time. All of these extras will be heavily featured in the background throughout the film. There&#39;s no pay, but there will be free meals and IMDB credit (optional). This is a great opportunity to be a part of a movie that wi<div class=""text_exposed_show"" style=""display: inline; "">ll tour the festival circuit and find distribution.&nbsp;<br /><br />DETAILS:<br /><br />MONDAY August 27th we are filming at Lawrence Middle School. 195 Broadway, Lawrence, NY 11559.

The call time for extras is approximately 9:30 AM.<br /><br />WEDNESDAY August 29th we are filming at Five Towns College. 305 North Service Road, Dix Hills, NY 11746.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />High school social outcasts Roy Offerman and Larry DiMarco struggle to find a drummer for their new punk rock band, Witness My Jehovah. As Roy will learn, sometimes finding the answer to one problem only brings about a host of others. Immediately after finding a drummer, Roy is plagued by a raging case of hemorrhoids. This causes his parents to be confused about his sexuality, and starts up all sorts of new rumors at school. In the most unexpected place, Roy meets his dream girl Samantha. As Roy and Sam&#39;s relationship develops, Witness My Jehovah lands their first big gig at a local music venue. When things don&#39;t go as planned, Roy is faced with some of the biggest decisions he&#39;ll ever have to make.<br /><br />For more info on the film please go to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2184956/"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" style=""cursor: pointer; color: rgb(59, 89, 152); text-decoration: none; "" target=""_blank""><span>http://www.imdb.com/title/</span><wbr />tt2184956/</a>&nbsp;Thank you!

"event","I just notice I public post to journals.  meh i can change it but whatever.  So this will be my last public post.  Just so people know. 



I am still at work!  I came in at 8:30am and wont leave till like 1ish maybe even 2am, and i have to come back in at 6am.  Ohh joy.  I really dont mind because they ok the overtime and this will help me A SHIT LOAD!!!  What can I say I really want to go to NYC again.  wow i am really hungry again....So I might move to second shift because this will help take the classes i need that are not given in the after noon. So if I get the classes the will be the following.....

ENGL 100 - FRESHMAN COMPOSITION ( 3 Units )
PHIL 120 - ETHICS ( 3 Units )
PSYCH 165 - INTRO HUMAN SEXUALITY 1 ( 3 Units )
And a Math class

So yeah full time student and worker.  There was an acting class i want to take but its in the evenning and i would have to take that at night.  I miss acting.  Unless you count work.  ""Free fake Smile for all there dumb demands"".  

Its never busy here where i work at night..well not all the time so as long as it stays not busy, then i can do all my homework at work. that is awesome!  My English class is going well my first essay won best essay of the class, which was kind of cool.  I wrote about the time i got my ass kicked.  It got laughs.  Which i think thats why it won. haha.  I dont care because i got an A+.  This last essay i got a B+ which surprised me.  Now for essay number 3 I am aiming for best essay again.  Its an evaluation about anything.  So I am doing it on Buffy the vampire slayer.  Haha yes this will be easier than...well it will just be easy. haha.  So yeah i am aiming high.  I should be working on that right now actually.  

Crap. i am getting tired. I need coffee.  If anyone wants to get me a cup or like a gallon that would be great!


Until next time I remain Rick weasel......"

"event","Her fingers flexed slightly, lashes fluttering as she willed herself to wake. She was just so warm, and comfortable, it seemed like a crime. She snuggled closer to whom ever she had her arms around, dimly aware of the draft on her arms and back. Sleep was just about to engulf her again when, she realized...<i>Who am I with?</i>. She paused. <i>Oh god...don't open your eyes...just dont!</i> her only thought, her body seizing up with a slight trepidation."

"event","She was watching the red liquid swirl in her glass with a bemused expression. They'd been sitting in the common room for a good ten minuets, but for some reason, the floor was still moving. Confused as hell, she swallowed the rest of the cup's contents, and fell to James's chest, ""J-James"" she stuttered. ""We're on a boat. You never told me you could"" she paused, blinking. ""Sail."" 

She couldn't tell if they were sitting on the floor, or a couch...or an emu...she just knew James, was fluffy, so she crawled ontop of him, straddling him as she laid her head down on his chest. ""Haha. I think the motors broken"" she mumbled, listening to his heart."

"event","She was curled in a rather worn chair in the back of the library, four large books open at her feet, a dusty volume over her curled knees. She scribbled furiously, fingers covered in a fine layer of ink as she completed her History of Magic essay.

It was getting close to nine, but she didn't want to be in the common room. One of them would be in there, so she wouldn't.

She sighed. She was tired, and worn, and delirious, and...just not herself. Her writing was even cramped and stressed. She considered pulling out her book of poetry, scribbling out a few thoughts, but it was still lodged under her pillow. Thinking of her bed made her ill, for some...strange reason. She shook her head, looking over what she had written. 
None of it made sense. She grabbed a new roll of parchment, and started over."

A sigh escaped her lips as she settled back into bed, listening hard to make sure James got back all right before removing her book of poetry and quill from a bag next to her bed. She paused, words floating so fast through her mind she didn't feel she could catch just one."

"event","Her hair spilled down her bare back as she laid on her stomach, back open to the sun's fury. Her arms were crossed over her rune homework once more, several diagrams at her elbows and under her nose as she dosed uncommonly peacefully, head rested on her arms and the rest of the muddle.

The squid provided a light breeze of sprinkling water as he too seemed to be enjoying the sun just as much as she was."

"event","She fumbled, and slipped, the hem of her robes catching and tearing as she slipped on the stairs. <i>Fool!</i> she scorned herself, touching the small scrape on her knee. She forced a few deep breaths, and hunched, wipping a few tears away as she glanced to her poetry, scatterd about the stairs in a circle around her.

<i>Molly is just being stupid, dont get in a twist over this</i> she pleaded, fresh tears being blinked as she struggled to hide her words.<i>Just...talk to her...</i> But she had tried that, didnt she? She didnt know why Molly was so cross with her. What if she and james were getting to know each other better? She had neglected them both equally, she thought with a bitter tremble.

<i>Yes, you fool.</i> Her pages fell from her hand, and she shook her head, and leaned back against the wall, staring at her mess as new tears fell.
a quote, a few steps below her seemed to be grinning at her, teasing her when she felt her worst.

<small><i>So we reach into the raging chaos and we pluck some small glittering thing, and we cling to it, and tell ourselves it has meaning, and that the world is good, and we are not evil.""</i></small>

""You utter fool."" She said aloud, staring at the parchment."

"event","She saw James come in to the common room, but refused to say anything as she lowered herself in her chair, lap conceal by several rune translations, transfiguration homework and, tucked underneath it all...her book of poetry. One page devoted to her newest creation, the other half to a quick note to Molly. They really hadn't talked in a while. It was almost impossible. She feared she had hurt Molly in her absence, and didn't quite know how to apologize. 

She watched james ruffle his hair, and then turned back to her poem.

<i><small>Do you have everything you want?
You can get up and give everything you've got
You can't run away from yourself.</small></i>

She glanced up to James, a pained look as she finished and started a letter to Molly, promising herself to send it as soon as possible. 

<lj-cut text=""Owl to Molly""> 
Molly?

I do hope you arent angry with me. I am sorry for not being around. I really want to know how you are. Do you think we could talk before we get old and wrinkly?

Much Love
Lily.
</lj-cut> 

She thought briefly of tearing out one of her poems to send with Molly's note, but thought better of it. She slid from underneath her pile of work, and crept out of the common room to the owlry."

"event","She hummed softly, sitting down in a far removed chair in the common room, setting her bag down with a heavy 'clunk' to the floor beside her. Her last class was finished, and all she could think about was the large amount of charms work she would have to get done by dinner. She leaned forward, and stretched, pulling a tie from her hair and let it fall in a great auburn mass. She smiled, and leaned back into the chair, her hair providing a very lovely pillow."

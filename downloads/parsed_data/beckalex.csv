"event","These are my New Year's Resolutions for 2011:

1. Keep doing what I'm doing because it's working.
2. Exercise more.
3. Write in my journal at least three times a week.
4. Write daily even just for a few minutes.
5. No more stupid boys, holy god.  

But the REAL resolutions are (in no particular order):

- Get a teaching job when I'm done with my credential.
- Get my own place."

"event","<p>I'm on a road trip with keli and her mom in the south. Right now we're on the road heading to Chapel Hill, NC and tomorrow we're going to continue on to Williamsburg and Jamestown, VA which I am super excited for since I love all things Colonial America. Then we'll head back down to Chapel Hill for a night and continue on to Charleston, SC for two days. From there we're heading to Andalusia and Savannah, GA before flying home from Atlanta.</p><p>I have to start cleaning out my room. My parents want everything decluttered because they're prepping to sell the house within the year. And tons of books and...stuff from my whole life I haven't gotten rid of. This is where a huge chapter of my life ends and a new one begins as I'm headed to to London for a Ph.D. in history - a dream I've had since forever. You know whats crazy? I applied to 11 American schools and 3 Canadian schools only to be accepted to one Canadian school in the great white bumfuck north, which i turned down. I applied to seven schools in the UK and i was accepted to six of them (rejected by Cambridge). What's up with that, universe? I'm headed to King's College London. It was a super tricky decision between that and University College London, which is higher ranked but the prof at KCL is very well-known in the field and all of his students have gotten good academic jobs. </p><p>When I'm done I'm thinking of starting a side business of graduate school advisement. It's a huge thing to do undergrad college advisement but no one does it for grad school and frankly someone needs to. By the time I'm done i'll be a pro having done grad school and professional certification both in and out of the States. Yeah, I'd say I'm qualified.</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

1. Was 2009 a good year for you? Why?

Surprisingly enough, I'd say it has been. 

2. What was your favorite moment of the year?

Lots of events, not exactly moments.  I had fun traveling and school has been nicely active this year. 

3. What was your least favorite moment of the year?

To be a cliche, probably when Damian told me he didn't want to ""do this"" anymore.

4. Where were you when 2009 began?

At Damian's grandma's.

5. Who were you with?

Damian and his family.

6. Where will you be when 2009 ends?

I have no idea.  I hope to be with friends. 

7. Who will you be with when 2009 ends?

Like I said, I hope to be with friends.

8. Did you keep your New Year's Resolutions of 2009?

I didn't make one.

9. Do you have New Year's Resolution(s) for 2010?

I don't think I'm making one.

10. Did you fall in love in 2009?

Nope.

11. If yes, with who?

...

12. If yes, do they know?

...

13. Are you still in love with them?

...

14. You regret it?

No regrets!

15. Did you break up with anyone in 2009?

As everyone knows, yes, with Damian after just under 5 years. 

16. Did you make any new friends in 2009?

I reconnected with Keli and became friends with her friend, Carina.  I also got really involved in the Associated Graduate Students of History as the secretary and became good friends with Rebekah, Darren, and Brandon (even though I was already sort of friends with Brandon).

17. Who are your favorite new friends?

See above.

18. What was your favorite month of 2009?

Maybe this one so far.  October was pretty good too.

19. Did you travel outside of your country of residence in 2009?

I did!  Australia and New Zealand, which was super-awesome.

20. How many different states / provinces did you travel to in 2009?

I've made it to Washington, Hawaii, and Nevada.

21. Did you lose anybody close to you in 2009?

Well, Damian and I broke up.

22. Did you miss anybody in the past year?

Yes.

I liked The Road, The Hangover, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, District 9, Inglorious Basterds, and Star Trek.

24. What was your favorite song from 2009?

Uh...according to Last.fm it was one of the tracks from the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince soundtrack.

25. What was your favorite record from 2009?

The above-mentioned soundtrack.

26. How many concerts did you see in 2009?

Just one - Trans-Siberian Orchestra last weekend.

27. Did you have a favorite concert in 2009?

They blow my mind every time!

28. Did you drink a lot of alcohol in 2009?

Not tons, but the AGSH sure had me drinking lots of wine. 

29. Did you do a lot of drugs in 2009?

I smoked some nice pot at the end of last semester, courtesy of Sherwood. 

30. How many people did you sleep with in 2009?

Just the one.  None since.

31. Did you do anything you are ashamed of this year?

Nope. 

33. What was the worst lie someone told you in 2009?

I'll be a cliche again: ""Of course I still love you.""

34. Did you treat somebody badly in 2009?

No.  I don't think I treat people badly.  But I think I hurt Richard's feelings when I told him I didn't want to date him (in a much nicer way than that, of course).

35. Did somebody treat you badly in 2009?

Damian sure jerked me around nicely.  If he stalks my livejournal, I sure hope he knows that not even Gil was that much of a jackass.

36. How much money did you spend in 2009?

A lot since I traveled a lot.

37. What was your proudest moment of 2009?

I had lots of good praise from my professors this semester. 

38. What was your most embarrassing moment of 2009?

None really, but the other night at a party I got drunk on accident and shot the pool ball off the table a few times in a row in front of Brandon.  Smooth. 

39. If you could go back in time to any moment of 2009 and change something, what would it be?

No regrets, baby. 

40. What are your plans for 2010?

GRADUATING and applying to Ph.D. programs.  Everything else is just gravy.

"event","Tonight I went to go see the movie, Precious, with Keli.  Unfortunately it was only playing at the Arclight Sherman Oaks, where Damian works.  I decided to to buck up and go because I shouldn't be letting a guy hold me back from seeing a movie that's playing at the one theater!  

&lt;lj-cut Text=&quot;I don't think I need to warn you about what kind of post this is...&quot;&gt;
Just in case I had a whole plan of what I'd do in case I ran into him.  I wasn't sure I'd see him since he technically has class Tuesday and Wednesday nights, but I've had suspicions for a few weeks now that he's dropped out of grad school because I haven't seen him at all.  My plan was to play it cool, act nonchalant, be happy while slightly aloof.  Be cordial and show that you're now happy regardless of his presence as if he doesn't matter.

<p>Keli and I were sitting on chairs looking with glee at a poster display of animated movies.  We were hilariously recounting which movies we love, which we hate, and which we need to see.  Well, more of what SHE needs to see.  Then suddenly I feel a tap on my shoulder.  I jump and boom!  I look up and it's Damian.  He's all smiles saying &quot;hi&quot; and I freeze up, my hands fly to my face, and I know I am expressing nothing but shock and sheer terror.  This is the first time I've seen him since August.  He looks the same.  I tried to remember my &quot;cool&quot; act but it's flown out of my head and all I can do is a couple of attempted smiles that turn into grimaces.  He just chuckles a little and tells me that &quot;it's okay&quot; or something like that, smiles again, and walks away.  He doesn't look back and I can't stop watching.  I sit there for a few moments and then run to the bathroom where I proceed to burst into tears.  

I've been doing great.  I've been happy, jovial, outgoing, and have barely spoken about him in months.  Then tonight I am regressing and weeping in the bathroom.  I did not go after him, I did not look for him, text him, etc.  Overall, I think I have played the role of Dumped Girlfriend very well as I've completely avoided begging, pleading, cursing, bitchtastic emails/voicemails, and shit in the mail.  But tonight I was crying in the bathroom like a teenager...even if it was just for a few minutes.

I don't understand why I still reacted this way and I don't understand why I still miss him.  He's working at a damn movie theater, making barely more than minimum wage, and living with his mother in Sylmar at the age of 26.  Since he's working tonight, it's clear that he dropped out of school like I thought.  Not a catch, while I am awesome.  Yet why do I miss him?!  

I have not been on any dates since summer, I have not hooked up with anyone, and I have not rebounded at all.  Now I am thinking that maybe it's the only way for me to move on.  The problem is I just don't know how to do that.  I don't have it in me.  I have no game with guys and no one goes for anyways so part of me just doesn't see what the point is.  I can't seem to get past the joking-slightly-flirty stage.

This is kind of awful because I have it in my head that he's dating up a storm or completely in love with a new girlfriend or sleeping with anyone and everything while I am here completely alone and shall remain so for the foreseeable future.  Back in August he said he would keep in touch with me, check in, email, call, etc.  However, he has done absolutely NONE of that (although neither have I) and yet he acts friendly when he sees me and then walks away without looking back.  I don't know why this is so awful and conflicting for me, but it just is.  We were together for just under five years and yet it seems like I was so ridiculously easy to completely throw away.  I have been doing so much better these last couple of months but that 30-second moment has made a huge chunk of myself fall down.  There's still this tiny part of me that hopes that we will get back together and that everything will change for the better.  I wish that part of me would die so I could stop feeling this way.  

I know everyone wants me to be happy and completely move on and I'm trying!  I've been doing so well, but I feel like I just can't shut off this part of me no matter how hard I work at it.  I want to be happy, I want to be completely moved on, but it's moments like these where I feel like none of it is happening and I just don't know what to do anymore.  Sometimes I feel like this will never end.

It's just a setback.
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

"event","Today is the first day of fall.  Obviously not by calendar standards, but my standards.  I can always tell when the fall season is starting by the way the light streams through my window.  On my first day of fall the light always looks slightly different.  It's more of a soft light rather than the harsh late-summer light.  Even though it may heat up again soon with the inevitable Santa Ana winds, fall is here and it's here to stay.

My school posts have all been regulated to my other blog, annewasinnocent.blogspot.com.  The title refers to Anne Boleyn.  After showing Keli both seasons of The Tudors it was appropriately on my mind.  I've always been somewhat of an Anne Boleyn sympathizer.  

In the past four weeks since I've updated I've gone on three dates from guys on the internet, all of which were unsuccessful.  One was creepy and had brown teeth; one was obnoxiously opinionated, had bad breath, and grabbed my boob (!); and one was enjoyable and I actually hoped to hear from him again, but I didn't.  It makes me wonder if I'm going about this the wrong way or if I'm doing something wrong.

I've run into Damian once since school started.  He came crawling back in late August saying he was wrong, I was right, and he's so so sorry.  He said he wanted things to work, he's lost sleep for weeks, all he can think about, etc. etc.  Two days later he takes it all back, says it was all spur of the moment, and never expected anything.  Needless to say, I spent a couple of days upset.  When I ran into him at school, he was horribly cold and distant.  I don't know this person.  How could someone you spent five years with suddenly become so hateful?  I've been thinking back to this time last year when it never once crossed my mind that we'd ever break up.  Then November came where it all started to crash down.  Now I have start all over again with someone else I find...IF there's someone else I find.  I'm feeling a bit disheartened at the moment, I must say.

I would love to go abroad and spend some time by myself for a while."

"event","Hello all!

I have started up a new blog separate of this one specifically for graduate school stuff.  Essentially, it's kind of a survival-guide that details my own experience in grad school while offering generic advice that could be good or bad.  I'll still be updating this one, of course (not that I update often enough anyways, haha).  

If you're interested in checking it out the link is:

http://annewasinnocent.blogspot.com

It was quite the collaborative effort: My friend, Keli, did the lovely header and Carly came up with the blog title.  Pretty sweet deal.

Overall this summer has been pretty successful.  I'm completely recovered from my surgery and I've lost ten pounds thus far.  My relationship with Damian has obviously ended (his loss!) and I went on a couple unsuccessful dates.  I have also returned from being a world traveler and now I need to start replenishing my savings somehow.  Here's to staying positive for life's grand adventure!"

Well, there's a new American Girl debuting in the series.  A Jewish Russian immigrant girl named Rebecca.  Of course I am going to have to read it to see how ridiculous and glamorous they make the lovely tenement life.  Why did this make me laugh?

"event","Yesterday was my breast reduction surgery and I feel ten times better today.  

<lj-cut Text=cut for friend page politeness"">

So yesterday I woke up at 4:30 because I had to be there at 5:30.  I had to take off all my jewelry, including earrings, because apparently the metal can burn your skin during surgery.  Who knew?  I sure didn't. 

When I got there, I was super nervous - especially when they started prepping me.  It happened really fast!  They kept telling me to calm down because my heart monitor was beeping really fast.  Like I said, I was pretty freaking nervous and I told them that.  So they put something in my IV to calm me down and after a few seconds I felt myself relax.  ""I'm about to get surgery,"" I thought.  ""Eh, who cares?  Whatever!""  The next thing I knew I was waking up.  When I woke up I was in a pretty decent amount of pain and I kept begging for something to make it stop so they put something else in my IV, which helped a lot.  After that they wheeled me into recovery where I slept for a little bit.  I went home at around 11:30.  

My aunt, Leslie, stayed at my house all day because she's a surgical nurse and wanted to put me on a medication schedule and keep watch.  She was super-helpful!  I came home and ate some rice pudding (nothing solid in case I puked) and took my medication.  I'm on an antibiotic that I have to take three times a day for the next week, I  have vicodin for pain management, an anti-nausea medication in case I feel like I have to puke (once again, which I haven't), and a sleeping pill in case I can't sleep at night.  I've also got two herbal remedies called arnica and bromelain, both of which help with bruising and swelling.  I'm taking vicodin around every three to four hours, even if I'm not hurting, because the body heals much better and faster when it's not in pain.  Other than being tired, the vicodin isn't giving me any side effects.

I went back to the doctor this morning to have my bandages changed.  I'm in a surgical bra (which is surprisingly REALLY nice and comfortable) and I have drainage tubes that have to be in until Wednesday.  Ick.  The nurse changed my bandages and said that I'm recovering remarkably well.  I risked a glance and was relieved to find that the girls don't look nasty or awful in any sense at all.  I'm going to be HOT once I'm healed.  I was a DDD pre-op and I should be a C post-op, but that will take a few months to truly settle into a new shape.  

Overall, I am so happy I did this and it was totally worth it.  Some friends of mine sent me texts to wish me well, which was really nice, and my grandparents came over for dinner in the evening.  Damian, by the way, has not texted or contacted me all to say he hopes I'm doing well.  *sigh*

Frankly, I'm glad this semester is over.  It has not been a good one overall.  I did not get along well with Dr. O at all and although I liked Dr. G as a professor, I couldn't get into the class subject (Enlightenment/French Revolution).  Then there was the whole boyfriend issue.  *sigh*  We're pretty much broken up, although he wants to try to give it another go.  I'm not sure how I feel about, but I don't deny that I'm hesitantly open to it.  If certain things change and if, IF we're able to actually move past this, then there's a possibility that things could work.  However, I am not holding myself back.  I'm sticking to the PLAN as my stepdad, Mitch, calls it.  Working out, getting in shape, traveling to Hawaii and Australia/New Zealand this summer along with a possible trip up to San Francisco, etc. etc.  I'm making this summer all about ME.  Trust me, that's a new concept.  I spend so much of my time focusing on other people that it's kind of weird for me to just focus on myself.  It's been almost two months now, and I'm finally starting to adjust to ""singledom"" as they call it.  I'm going out with friends more, doing more things, and I've reconnected with my old friend, Keli, and that's very awesome.

In other news for those of you who don't know:  On Friday I am having breast reduction surgery.  This is something I have been thinking about since I was 20 and my doctor has been really insistent that I look into it because over the past two years I've begun to develop back/neck/shoulder issues.  My doctor said all of that will just get a lot worse and that surgery would be beneficial.  So I'm finally biting the bullet and DOING IT.  I'm a DDD cup and my surgeon says he will be able to get me down to a full C cup.  And I can't deny that for vanity's sake I look forward to being able to wear and fit into nicer clothes.

Next semester should be better than this one class-wise.  I'm going to be a TA for Dr. M's 470 Colonial America course while taking his colloquium on Atlantic history.  I'll also be taking the colloquium on the US South with Dr. B and I hear she's awesome.  My focus is the Colonial Atlantic South, so this will be perfect.  I need to come up with a thesis topic so I can get rolling on that - I'm hoping my classes next semester will help me out.  My goal is to finish in three more semester and apply for Ph.D. programs in fall of 2010 for the 2011 year.  As of now that's a little ambitious because I still need my seminars, but if both of the ones I need are offered next spring I should be good to go.  My mom just got her Bachelor's (she graduated today!) and she's starting her Master's program in two weeks - Marriage Family Therapy.  It's quite possible we could be graduating with MA degrees the same semester!"

I got a B- on the first one, a C- on the second, and a C+ on the third one.  I have to write the fourth one today.  I've gone to the professor's non-existent office hours twice (""by appointment only"") and still have no idea what she wants.  I was too clinical with the first one and needed to take a step back and be free with it.  I was too flowery and unprofessional with the second one - ""Not what I would expect from a graduate student.""  This last one I don't analyze enough. 

I feel like this semester has been overall completely unenjoyable and unsuccessful.  I am almost at the point of wondering what the hell am I am doing here.

I thought, ""Hm, I will buy a book on AH and see if it gives me any inspiration or ideas of what direction to dive into thesis-wise.""  

As I expected, I found AH books on a grand total of two subjects: Pirates and Cod.  Now, since I don't give a crap about cod, I went for pirates.  There were two books.  I picked one  up, scanned the chapter index, and turned to the bibliography.  I saw that the author only cited secondary sources and I immediately shivered and put the book back.  The other book's bibliography was nothing but primary sources.  I felt immense relief and gleefully paid for it.

As I walked out of the store, I was hit with the sudden realization that I have officially turned into a history snob.  Grad school has finally succeeded in turning me into a historiography snob."

"event","So apparently people think it's impossible to read for fun while in college, let alone graduate school.  I have a tendency to disagree with that.

My main point of view when it comes to grad school is through the lens of history at the master's level.  This semester I have to read a grand total of 30 books for school.  Last semester it was 20.  The semester before it was 14.  The number keeps going up (but so does my courseload).  In general, I am reading two textbooks a week in addition to the assigned readings for the course I am a TA in.

Personally, I can still easily find the time to read for pleasure.  It just doesn't happen in huge bursts of time like it used to.  Instead of sitting and reading for hours and hours on end, I take the book with me and read bits of it in my car if I arrive at my destination early.  I read a bit if I'm eating a meal by myself.  If I arrive to class early, I will read for a minute or two before other people arrive.  And at least once I week I carve out some hours for fun-reading.  It's possible, I swear.  You just have to work at it a bit.  This is mostly in response to someone asking me yesterday in class how I'm humanly able to read anything besides classwork."

"event","The medievalist is back on CSUN's staff next semester - she's been on maternity leave.  This means I can FINALLY get rolling with my primary area of focus: European History (Medieval-Early Modern).  And how do I get to start off my focus?  With a graduate course on the Black Death.  Awesome or not?  I think awesome.  As of right now it's looking like my thesis topic will concentrate on medieval medical practices among the lower/peasantry classes - midwifery, superstition/herbal based remedies, wise women, etc.  I would also like to explore disease and medical history in post-Black Death Britain.  

I emailed Dr. A last week asking him if he would need or like a TA for his Western Civ post-1500 course next spring and he emailed me back this afternoon to say he'd be ""very pleased"" to have me as his TA.  We're going to discuss ideas on November 18.  This will be great experience - I'll be able to start building a C.V. and this will look great for future Ph.D. applications.  I feel so...professional."

"event","So I tell my one of my two bosses that I am putting in my two weeks notice because I got a substantially increased bookload for the semester.  And plus, secretly, I've been unhappy and dissatisfied with the job.  Here's her reaction in a nutshell:

- Please don't tell me your going to tell me that you can't work anymore.
- You can't do this to me.  You can't do this to me!
- You are SCREWING us, Rebecca.  You are SCREWING us!  You are going to SCREW us!
- This is your last week here.  I don't want to give you another PENNY!
- If I had known that this would happen I never would have hired you in the first place!  People who used to work here asked to come back and I told them no because I said Rebecca is working.
- I was depending on you for Mondays and Wednesdays and now you're letting the whole store down and SCREWING us!  <i>[she does like that word, doesn't she?]</i>
- Thanks to you, this summer has been a complete waste of money!

The whole time I stand there unable to believe her totally uncharacteristic outburst.  I stand there with my hands slightly raised and I just calmly say over and over, <b>""I'm sorry, I didn't anticipate this, I understand, yada yada yada.""</b>  I ask her if she even wants me to finish out the week and she just snaps, <b>""I can't even answer that - I'm so pissed right now!""</b>  I just give her my resignation letter (which was a very nice letter from me <i>thanking</i> her for hiring me back for the summer even though I have to leave...ironic).

I come back from my break SUPER pissed off and somewhat shaken when she gestures me to come into the back.  I expect a further lashing and I think to myself, <i>""If she goes off again then I am walking out right now.""</i>  Turns out she wants to <b>""apologize for losing it back there.""</b>  I just nod and say, ""Thank you.""  She says that she understands why I have to leave and that I'm not doing it on purpose to make her mad and that she wants me to finish out my two weeks.  She says she's been stressed because her husband is having his second risky surgery next week, the business is struggling, the economy sucks, etc.  I just nod and say something like ""I understand.""  She says I've been a good worker and that she and everyone else will miss me, etc. etc.  I point out that I wanted to give notice now before they really came to depend on me this fall and before I would undoubtedly become overwhelmed and quit right before the November sale.  She nods and says she appreciates and understands that.  Basically, she feels bad for flying off the handle and wants to part on good terms. Also, she would be more than happy if I came back to work over the holidays.

Notes I can make to myself about this encounter:
A) You don't know peoples' true colors until they get angry (thanks, Rico).
B) Thanks, Boss.  Now I KNOW I've made the right decision in leaving.
C) Never, EVER will I work in that store again under any circumstances despite the fact that most of the coworkers are cool.
D) When you spout out angry bullshit, you can't ever take it back no matter how hard you apologize."

"event","I've had the hardest time finding something good to read for....say....the last year.  It's driving me a little crazy because I hate having nothing to read as I go through things so quickly.  I would be going a lot crazier if it weren't for the fact that I've managed to find readable material just in the nick of time.  It seems that most fiction coming out in the past few years are all written by authors who graduated from the same crappy creative writing course.  I don't really like reading nonfiction because unless it's for class, I read strictly for fun.  I don't usually have fun reading nonfiction unless it's a cool, different type of history, or if it's an amazingly scary book about some rampaging virus.  My education is so amazingly reading intensive that I don't have the energy to read to learn outside of school.

However, here are some good books I've read that have kept me mostly sane in no particular order:
- <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> by Margaret Atwood.  This was good because it was so amazingly fucked up and the whole time I would wonder if it could possibly come true.  Religious extremists coming to power and reducing women to baby-making and other menial tasks.  Freaked me out and I couldn't stop reading.
- <i>Sepulcure</i> by Kate Mosse.  This book was a cross between historical fiction, fantasy, mystery, and thriller.  I was skeptical when I started because the New York Times' best-seller lists usually fail me, but I was thoroughly intrigued by this book and it reawakended my old passion for French history (the time before British history became my intrigue).
- <i>World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War</i> by Max Brooks.  This was...interesting.  A little hard to follow because it was written as if it were a series of interviews, but overall it was a quite engrossing tale about a virus that makes the dead become undead.
- <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> by Khaled Housseini.  Absolutely amazing.  It was about the lives of two women living in Taliban Afghanistan.  Once again, amazing.
-<i>Life As We Knew It</i> by Susan Beth Pfeffer.  Teen speculative fiction.  A meteor hits the moon and knocks it slightly closer to earth.  The results?  Endless tidal waves and tsunamis, destroyed oil refineries world-wide, earthquakes, insane weather, endless volcanic eruptions from volcanos all over the world (live and extinct) due to the more intense gravitational pull - the result of which is nuclear winter starting in the summer.  I don't know how likely any of the scenarios were, but it was still damn interesting.  
<i>The Dead and the Gone</i> by Susan Beth Pfeffer.  Same premise as Life as we Knew It, but this time it takes place in New York.

There's more but I can't remember.  That must mean that they weren't quite as memorable.

I've also started writing again.  I used to write all the time when I was younger but that practically ceased in college.  I've taken upon myself to start it up again because I've always wanted to get published.  If so much crappy ""literature"" is getting the greenlight, then I have to have a shot...right?  If TWILIGHT could become a hit, then I HAVE to have a chance!"

"event","....part of the tip of my middle finger last week.

<lj-cut text=""story + pictures for the reader's pleasure"">

I went to Sushi Agoura to hold three seats at the bar (me, my mom, brother Matt).  As I was scooting myself into the seat, my finger got caught between the cushion and bar of the chair.  The edge pierced through part of my nail and in shock, I ripped out my finger thus sealing the damage.  The pain seared through my whole arm and blood was pumping into my other hand as I tried to conceal the wound.  After freaking out in the bathroom and having one of the sushi chefs bandage my finger, I had no choice but to wait for my mom practically out of my mind with pain.  When my mom arrived, she asked if I needed to go home or to the ER but I had already caused such a public fuss that I just wanted to be left alone.  Besides, the pain was so intense that I couldn't even really think of coherent answers to her questions.

The next day I had to go to the doctor where they proceeded to give me a tetnus shot, antibacterial medication, codeine, and doctor's note excusing me from working for 2 days.  I work in a shoe store - can you imagine that I'd be able to fit shoes?  I think not.

About a week and a half later, my finger has healed quite well except the tip is numb but when I bump it, pain shoots up my arm.  Oh joy.  The doctor says it will heal fine but my nail might grow back funny and it may take a while for full feeling to return (if it does at all).  No stitches...there was really no piece to stitch back on.

Onto the pictures, which I took tonight so they're not that gross.

My finger in it's daily protective bandage: a splint, two bandaides, and neosporin.

Side view.  You can see how it's nicely flat-topped, as Fred calls it.

"event","I had my student teaching orientation today over at Flory Academy in Moorpark.  I have been assigned to do my intro to student teaching at Abraham Lincoln Elementary School in Simi Valley for the 3rd grade.  Student teaching goes Monday - Wednesday from approximately 8 - noon.  Then on Tuesday, Wednesdays, and Thursdays I have class.  I will also have seminars every other Monday afternoon and supervision meetings every other Thursday afternoon.  

In the meantime, I have dropped Theory and Historiography at CSUN because it will conflict with the biweekly Thursday seminars.  However, I am still taking my Colonial American history class on Wednesday nights because that has no conflicts that I can forsee.  Looks like for at least this semester and next semester I will only be taking one class at a time at CSUN.  I feel a little lame, but I think two Master's classes with student teaching would just be too stressful.  I have 7 years to complete the Master's anyways.  That's not going anywhere (yes, I am pretty much comforting myself on the slight dent in my pride of dropping a class).

In the meantime I have mostly been chilling.  I've been sort of cutting out food from my diet...well, not really cutting out - more like cutting back.  Eating better pretty much...like having half a sandwich instead of a whole sandwich, making my coffee drinks sugar free, etc.  I have also added 30 minutes of cardio into my daily routine.  Last night I watched the first half hour of Pirates and the time went like <i>that</i>.  I've always hated feeling sweaty (which is the main reason why I've always had a tendency to avoid exercise).  It makes me feel itchy and gross.  However, Damian told me I smell good when I sweat (take that as you will) so that's a decent redeeming factor.

Having left Jack's Shoes I have more free time on my hands for reading.  I am currently reading <i>The Pillars of Earth</i> by Ken Follett and I am enjoying it, much to my surprise.  I couldn't imagine how a 900+ page book about the building of a cathedral could be interesting, but I was wrong!  I've been in a reading funk since I got bored of Anne Perry back in September/early October.  This book is the first real good book I've read since <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> by Khaled Hosseini (which everyone should read).  I read a book last month called <i>Keeper of the Crystal Spring</i>.  It wasn't that good at all, but it was JUST interesting enough to keep me going.  I've started and put down at least six books in the last month.  A few weeks ago I went to Barnes and Noble with a pen and paper to scope out the shelves to make myself a reading list.  I made a pretty decent one...let's just hope the books will be up to snuff.  After I finish this book I will probably read the sequel, <i>World Without End</i> and after that I want to read <i>Innocent Traitor</i>, which is about Lady Jane Grey, the Nine Day's Queen.  

That is about all I got to report for now."

<u>HIST 601: Theory and Historiography [required]</u>
<i>That Noble Dream</i> ~ Novick
<i>Knowledge & Postmodernism in Historical Perspective</i> ~ Appleby
<i>Imagined Communities</i> ~ Benedict Anderson [after reading the intro to his book in my seminar class, I swore NEVER to have anything to do with him again.  He returns to haunt me.  Let's hope and pray that the rest of the book is more interesting than his stupid introduction.]
<i>Cheese & The Worms</i> ~ Carlo Ginzburg.  [I had to read his book on witchcraft and it was the worst translation I ever had to sit through.  I hated it and it made me hate him.  This book has two translators.  They better have done a good job or else I will never go near him again.]
<i>Communist Manifesto</i> ~ Karl Marx 
<i>City of Quartz</i> ~ Davis.  [I'm not too into California history, particularly LA history, but hopefully this ends up being interesting.]

"event","Well, I have officially applied at CSUN.  Now all I have to do is wait until after Thanksgiving to found out anything.  Woot.

I start student teaching next semester.  Whee!  That means these stupid foundations courses are FINALLY almost done.  Thank god for that.  My last observation at Colina is next week.  My favorite class to observe is Mrs. Kennedy's 6th grade English/Social Studies ELD class.  They're so adorable!  And they like me because took the effort to introduce myself to them in a mixture of English and Spanish.  

Steve offered me my job back with the promise of making me an assistant manager, but I said no.  Too many hours required of me.  Instead, I am applying to work part-time at Jack's Shoes.  It looks easy, laid back, flexible, and requires less hours of me.  Not to mention I'd get a killer discount on shoes, which is awesome because they sell tons of Danskos shoes and those shoes are expensive (but worth it since they last FOREVER)."

"event","Someone please tell me.

I have just completely filled out an application to CSUN for a Master's in History for the Spring 2008 program.  I have emailed Professors Fels and Klein asking for recommendations, which are due November 1.  

I can't do a Master's in Education.  I just can't.  I am so frusterated in my classes.  You have no idea.  I still want to be a teacher and I want the credentials.  But I really, really want to be studying history, not education.  

Should I do both?  Have I just made a crazy rash decision?  Do I know what I'm doing?  What if my professors decide not to write me recommendations?  What if they think I'm not a good enough student to recommend to a Master's program?  What if they question my motives and think I am just impulsive and make rash decisions without properly thinking them through?

But doesn't it make sense to pursue a Master's in a subject you have passion for?  A subject you love?  A subject you're good at versus a subject that bores you and pisses you off constantly?

Maybe I am crazy.

*Edit 10:46 AM: Professor Klein wrote me back saying basically he'll be glad to provide me with another recommendation.  I have sent off rush orders for my transcripts at USF, Goucher, and Moorpark.  My statement of purpose is completely written and ready.  All I have to do now is wait for stuff to get to me and wait to see if Fels still has my recommendation saved on his computer like Klein did.  Oy."

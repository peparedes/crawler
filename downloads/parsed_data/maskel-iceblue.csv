"event","so Cameron is way into Ayn Rand. he posted something on his facebook - I'll link it in a second <a href=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=118014357230>here</a> - that Andie replied to that got me thinking. altruism. it's just another form of control. it's the way that someone can 'help' you out and stake a claim in how you live your life, giving you 'advice' on what to do. when my sister and I were growing up, we would boss each other around and give commands that we expected to be followed all the time. mom would always tell us, 'take care of yourself, don't try to control your sister.' well now that we've grown older, we use those words right back to her. she was trying to meddle in my life two days ago, telling me I should leave to make it to a time commitment on-time. I ended up shouting, 'mom! take care of yourself! it's my life to live how I want!' and her response was, 'I'm just trying to help.' which really, no she wasn't. she was trying to control me and my choices in life. true, that the 'help' was on a small scale, but it builds over time (thus the shouting). today Andie claimed that altruism came from religion and it got me thinking. I claim that it comes from the desire to dominate. humans have changed every thing they have ever touched, mountains blown to bits, forests cut down, ancient pyramids built up high. we have within us the desire to control our environment, not just ourselves. altruism probably began as a condition-filling requirement: you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. it was so successful that it became one of the foundations for much of religion and how people raise their children. but secretly, wrapped in the tiny kernel in the center of altruism, is the fact that it was born of true selfishness (which is how it's managed to stick around for so long). why simply have self-control of your personal life when you can have control of so much more? instead of teaching our children to do kind acts out of the goodness of their heart, we should teach them to 'take care of themselves' alone. they might want it, but that doesn't mean they have the right to control another person's life."

"event","just went snowboarding for the first time in my life. pretty exciting actually. you're supposed to go down the slope with your board parallelish to the ski lift. I did that just fine on the Bunny Hill, but that was short, I still fell down, and I didn't know how to stop or steer. whenever I fell down I was panting too. like I'd just hardcore worked out. and Eric and Katy were still breathing normally - not that I envied them or anything... so Eric and Katy had faith that I was good enough for the run Duck Soup however, so we slide/walk over to that lift and start going. they explain to me how to 'leaf' which is putting your weight on your heels and shifting your weight from foot to foot so that your board is directly below you and perpendicularish to the lift. good quad workout. anyways, I become competent at leafing and then start to have trouble standing up because my muscles are used to being lazy and are complaining about the amount of work I'm making them do. plus I continuously fall down. superman style, on my stomach. I fell once on my ass at the Bunny Hill, but I hit hard and I definitely cracked/bruised my ass because it's been hurting all day since that particular moment. so I preferred to fall superman style. but then after lunch, I must have eaten too much, or my metabolism seriously sucks because the next time I fell superman, I felt like I was going to throw up it hurt so much. so that made me want to quit. I went on the Duck Soup run once after lunch and stopped because I felt so sick. it was horrible. I'd rather fall on my already-in-pain ass then fall on my stomach one more time. I kept getting super hot too, so when I quit, I went and laid in the snow next to the parked buses and just cooled off. when I got a little chill, I went into the lodge and I ended up taking a nap on the red leather seats they have. I even drooled a little. slightly gross. the bus was open at 3pm and I was on it at 3:05 to finish my nap and hopefully stop drooling all over. I think the bus ride back made me stiff. I was fine except for my butt before the ride. o well. it was really fun. :D"

"event","I had a dream recently that my totem spirit animal was a tiger, but then later in the dream it switched and was a bear. so then even in the dream I was confused as to if it was a bear or a tiger. what do you think?

well which one did you feel more attached to?

idk. see in the dream it was a person/friend - I dont remember how it started out but then it changed into a little figurine that I could hold in my hand. it was a tiger when I was by myself looking at it, but it changed into a bear when I tried to show it to someone

I think youre going to just need to have another dream to figure it out. sometimes thats what it takes

I suppose I could be both... ? but yeah. another dream might clear it up better

I mean. the first instinct I had was that maybe your spirit animal changed around people. like. when you get around other people. your personality changes. but that seems odd. cause you don't seem to be that type of person

o. but I totally do. lol. spot-on nina. I feel like I become what the person needs/wants me to become - within reason. Im not going to totally change the way I am. but I do act differently for and with different people

well thats probably what it is. do you find yourself going from more calm and peaceful to more... I don't want to say agressive but more large of a personality and a stronger person?

well Id more say like Im truly me when Im all by myself. no one to change the way Im behaving. when I hang out with other people, sometimes I get a bigger personality depending on if the group dynamics call for it. Im kind of like a filler...

like kevin. he does the same thing

yeah lol. he does. maybe thats why when we hang out its awkward - but not you know?

haha probably. you guys just don't know what to mesh into

but I love it cause we totally understand. so its not truly awkward at all

"event","every night that you sleep, you dream. usually you never remember these dreams unless you can lucid dream (LD) or something. that's rare though. well ever since Sunday, I've been remembering all my dreams. well not all, but long snippets I guess. anyways. last night's dream involved Elizabeth so I decided to write it down. the dream started in Springfield at this Fin diner place. basically burgers, shakes, and fries place that still lets you order from your car if you want. I had this giant SUV type Jeep thing. kind of like Victoria's Jeep, but dark in color. so I'm standing the parking lot talking to mom? and dad? and Rachel? and I get in my car and Rachel gets in the passenger seat and Joy - my stepmom - and my dad get in the back seats and we're driving on Franklin and I'm going fast and my parents and Rachel are thinking that I'm going to fast - which of course makes me angry, so I drive faster and we're whipping around the slight corners and I'm in the lane to merge onto Ferry St Bridge but I wanted to go downtown so Joy's yelling at me to take a right and at the last second I drive over the dividing curb and I'm smiling like a maniac and everyone else is holding onto their OH SHIT handles and somehow as we're passing under the bridge the car disappears and we're suddenly on roller blades and there's this pipe that you skate/grind down to get off the bridge, so there's literally stick people in roller blades vying for their turn to grind down the pipe. I shove people out of the way and grind down ending up on the side walk and Rachel has morphed into Justin, so he's busy grinding down too and Joy has changed into Liz who's wearing a wedding dress and having hysterics because I'm in her wedding and am busy skating around instead of trying on dresses. dad has morphed into Uncle Tom and he's scowling at me, trying to make me come into the dress shop so Liz will calm down. and then the dream ended. yay for alarms waking you up.

"event","Just before I left Oxford for the Tiv in West Africa, conversation turned to the season at Stratford.  ""You Americans,"" said a friend, ""often have difficulty with Shakespeare.  He was, after all, a very English poet, and one can easily misinterpret the universal by misunderstanding the particular."" I protested that human nature is pretty much the same the whole world over; at least the general plot and motivation of the greater tragedies would always be clear - everywhere - although some details of custom might have to be explained and difficulties of translation might produce other slight changes.  To end an argument we could not conclude, my friend gave me a copy of <i>Hamlet</i> to study in the African bush; it would, he hoped, lift my mind above its primitive surroundings, and possibly I might, by prolonged meditation, achieve the grace of correct interpretation.
     It was my second field trip to that African tribe, and I thought myself ready to live in one of its remote sections - an area difficult to cross, even on foot.  I eventually settled on the hillock of a very knowledgeable old man, the head of a homestead of some hundred and forty people, all of whom were either his close relatives or their wives and children.  Like the other elders of the vicinity, the old man spent most of his time performing ceremonies seldom seen these days in the most accessible parts of the tribe.  I was delighted.  Soon there would be three months of enforced isolation and leisure, between the harvest that takes place just before the rising of the swamps and the clearing of new farms when the water goes down.  Then, I thought, they would have even more time to perform ceremonies and explain them to me.
     I was quite mistaken.  Most of the ceremonies demanded the presence of elders from several homesteads.  As the swamps rose, the old men found it too difficult to walk from one homestead to the next, and the ceremonies gradually ceased.  As the swamps rose even higher,  all activities but one came to an end.  The women brewed beer from maize and millet.  Men, women, and children sat on their hillocks and drank it.
     People began to drink at dawn.  By midmorning the whole homestead was singing, dancing, and drumming.  when it rained, people had to sit inside their huts: there they drank and sang or they drank and told stories.  In any case, by noon or before, I either had to join the party or retire to my own hut and books.  ""One does not discuss serious matters when there is beer.  Come, drink with us.""  Since I lacked their capacity for the thick native beer, I spent more and more time with <i>Hamlet</i>.  Before the end of the second month, grace descended on me.  I was quite sure that <i>Hamlet</i> had only one possible interpretation, and that one universally obvious.
     Early every morning, in the hope of having some serious talk before the beer party.  I used to call on the old man at his reception hut - a circle of posts supporting a thatched roof above a low mud wall to keep out wind and rain.  One day I crawled through the low doorway and found most of the men of the homestead sitting huddled in their ragged cloths on stools, low plank beds, and reclining chairs, warming themselves against the chill of the rain around a smoky fire.  In the center were three pots of beer.  The party had started.
     The old man greeted me cordially.  ""Sit down and drink.""  I accepted a large calabash full of beer, poured some into a small drinking gourd, and tossed it down.  Then I poured some more into the same gourd for the man second in seniority to my host before I handed my calabash over to a young man for further distribution.  Important people shouldn't ladle beer themselves.
     ""It is better like this."" the old man said, looking at me approvingly and plucking at the thatch that had caught in my hair.  ""You should sit and drink with us more often.  Your servants tell me that when you are not with us, you sit inside your hut looking at a paper.""
     The old man was acquainted with four kinds of ""papers"": tax receipts, bride price receipts, court free receipts, and letters.  The messenger who brought him letters from the chief used them mainly as a badge of office, for he always knew what was in them and told the old man.  Personal letters for the few who had relatives in the government or mission stations were kept until someone went to a large market where there was a letter writer and reader.  Since my arrival, letters were brought for me to be read.  A few men also brought me bride price receipts, privately, with requests to change the figures to a higher sum.  I found moral arguments were of no avail, since in-laws are fair game, and the technical hazards of forgery difficult to explain to an illiterate people.  I did not wish them to think me silly enough to look at any such papers for days on end, and I hastily explained that my ""paper"" was one of the ""things of long ago"" of my country.
     ""Ah,"" said the old man.  ""Tell us.""  I protested that I was not a storyteller.  Storytelling is a skilled art among them;  their standards are high and the audiences critical - and vocal in their criticism.  I protested in vain.  This morning they wanted to hear a story while they drank.  They threatened to tell me no more stories until I told them one of mine.  Finally, the old man promised that no one would criticize my style ""for we know you are struggling with our language,""  ""But,"" put in one of the elders, ""you must explain what we do not understand, as we do when we tell our stories.""  Realizing that here was my chance to prove <i>Hamlet</i> universally intelligible, I agreed.
     The old man handed me some more beer to help me on with my storytelling.  Men filled their long wooden pipes and knocked coals from the fire to place in the pipe bowls; then, puffing contentedly, they sat back to listen.  I began in the proper style, ""Not yesterday, not yesterday, but long ago, a thing occurred.  One night three men were keeping watch outside the homestead of the great chief, when suddenly they saw the former chief approach them.""
     ""Why was he no longer their chief?""
     ""He was dead,"" I explained.  ""That is why they were troubled and afraid when they saw him.""
     ""Impossible,"" began one of the elders, handing his pipe on to his neighbor, who interrupted, ""Of course it wasn't the dead chief.  It was an omen sent by a witch.  Go on.""
     Slightly shaken, I continued.  ""One of these three was a man who knew things"" - the closest translation for scholar, but unfortunately it also meant witch.  The second elder looked triumphantly at the first.  ""So he spoke to the dead chief saying, 'Tell us what we must do so you may rest in your grave.' but the dead chief did not answer.  He vanished, and they could see him no more.  Then the man who knew things - his name was Horatio - said this event was the affair of the dead chief's son, Hamlet.""
     There was a general shaking of heads round the circle.  ""Had the dead chief no living brothers?  Or was this son the chief?""
     ""No,"" I replied.  ""That is, he had one living brother who became the chief when the elder brother died.""  The old men muttered: such omens were matters for chiefs and elders, not for youngsters; no good could come of going behind a chief's back; clearly Horatio was not a man who knew things.
     ""Yes, he was,"" I insisted, shooing a chicken away from my beer.  ""In our country the son is next to the father.  The dead chief's younger brother had become the great chief.  He had also married his elder brother's widow only about a month after the funeral.""
     ""He did well,"" the old man beamed and announced to the others, ""I told you that if we knew more about Europeans, we would find they really were very like us.  In our country also,"" he added to me, ""the younger brother marries the elder brother's widow and becomes the father of his children.  Now, if your uncle, who married your widowed mother, is your father's full brother, then he will be a real father to you.  Did Hamlet's father and uncle have one mother?""
     His question barely penetrated my mind;  I was too upset and thrown too far off balance by having one of the most important elements of Hamlet knocked straight out of the picture.  Rather uncertainly I said that I thought they had the same mother, but I wasn't sure - the story didn't say.  The old man told me severely that these genealogical details made all the difference and that when I got home I must ask the elders about it.  He shouted out the door to one of his younger wives to bring his goatskin bag.
     Determined to save what I could of the mother motif, I took a deep breath and began again.  ""The son Hamlet was very sad because his mother had married again so quickly.  There was no need for her to do so, and it is our custom for a widow not to go to her next husband until she has mourned for two years.""
     ""Two years is too long,"" objected the wife, who had appeared with the old man's battered goatskin bag.  ""Who will hoe your farms for you while you have no husband?""
     ""Hamlet,"" I retorted without thinking, ""was old enough to hoe his mother's farms himself.  There was no need for her to remarry.""  No one looked convinced.  I gave up.  ""His mother and the great chief told Hamlet not to be sad, for the great chief himself would be a father to Hamlet.  Furthermore, Hamlet would be the next chief: therefore he must stay to learn the things of a chief.  Hamlet agreed to remain, and all the rest went off to drink beer.""
     While I paused, perplexed at how to render Hamlet's disgusted soliloquy to an audience convinced that Claudius and Gertrude had behaved in the best possible manner, one of the younger men asked me who had married the other wives of the dead chief.
     ""He had no other wives,"" I told him.
     ""But a chief must have many wives!  How else can he brew beer and prepare food for all his guests?""  I said firmly that in our country even chiefs had only one wife, that they had servants to do their work, and that they paid them from tax money.
     It was better, they returned, for a chief to have many wives and sons who would help him hoe his farms and feed his people; then everyone loved the chief who gave much and took nothing - taxes were a bad thing.  I agreed with the last comment, but for the rest fell back on their favorite way of fobbing off my questions: ""That is the way it is done, so that is how we do it.""
     I decided to skip the soliloquy.  Even if Claudius was here thought quite right to marry his brother's widow, there remained the poison motif, and I knew they would disapprove of fratricide.  More hopefully I resumed, ""that night Hamlet kept watch with the three who had seen his dead father.  The dead chief again appeared, and although the others were afraid, Hamlet followed his dead father off to one side.  When they were alone, Hamlet's dead father spoke.""
     ""Omens can't talk!""  The old man was emphatic.
     ""Hamlet's dead father wasn't an omen.  Seeing him might have been an omen, but he was not.""  My audience looked as confused as I sounded.  ""It was Hamlet's dead father.  It was a thing we call a 'ghost'."" I had to use the English word, for unlike many of the neighboring tribes, these people didn't believe in the survival after death of any individuating part of the personality.
     ""What is a 'ghost?'  An omen?""
     ""No, a 'ghost' is someone who is dead but who walks around and can talk, and people can hear him and see him but not touch him.""
     They objected, ""One can touch zombis.""
     ""No, no!  It was not a dead body the witches had animated to sacrifice and eat.  No one else made Hamlet's dead father walk.  He did it himself.""
     ""Dead men can't walk,"" protested my audience as one.
     I was quite willing to compromise, ""A 'ghost' is the dead man's shadow.""
     But again they objected.  ""Dead men cast no shadows.""
     ""They do in my country,"" I snapped.
     The old man quelled the babble of disbelief that arose immediately and told me with that insincere, but courteous, agreement one extends to the fancies of the young, ignorant, and superstitious, ""No doubt in your country the dead can also walk without being zombis.""  From the depth of his bag he produced a withered fragment of kola nut, bit off one end to show it wasn't poisoned, and handed me the rest as a peace offering.
     ""Anyhow,"" I resumed, ""Hamlet's dead father said that his own brother, the one who became chief, had poisoned him.  He wanted Hamlet to avenge him.  Hamlet believed this in his heart, for he did not like his father's brother.""  I took another swallow of beer.  ""In the country of the great chief, living in the same homestead, for it was a very large one, was an important elder who was often with the chief to advise and help him.  His name was Polonius.  Hamlet was courting his daughter, but her father and her brother...[I cast hastily about for some tribal analogy] warned her not to let Hamlet visit her when she was alone on her farm, for he would be a great chief and so could not marry her.""
     ""Why not?"" asked the wife, who had settled down on the edge of the old man's chair.  He frowned at her for asking stupid questions and growled, ""They lived in the same homestead.""
     ""That was not the reason,"" I informed them.  ""Polonius was a stranger who lived in the homestead because he helped the chief, not because he was a relative.""
     ""Then why couldn't Hamlet marry her?""
     ""He could have,"" I explained, ""but Polonius didn't think he would.  After all, Hamlet was a man of great importance who ought to marry a chief's daughter, for in his country a man could have only one wife.  Polonius was afraid that if Hamlet made love to his daughter, then no one else would give a high price for her.""
     ""That might be true,"" remarked one of the shrewder elders, ""but a chief's son would give his mistress's father enough presents and patronage to more than make up the difference.  Polonius sounds like a fool to me.""
     ""Many people think he was,"" I agreed.  ""Meanwhile Polonius sent his son Laertes off to Paris to learn the things of that country, for it was the homestead of a very great chief indeed.  Because he was afraid that Laertes might waste a lot of money on beer and women and gambling, or get into trouble by fighting, he sent one of his servants to Paris secretly, to spy out what Laertes was doing.  One day Hamlet came upon Polonius's daughter Ophelia.  He behaved so oddly he frightened her.  Indeed"" - I was fumbling for words to express the dubious quality of Hamlet's madness - ""the chief and many others had also noticed that when Hamlet talked one could understand the words but not what they meant.  Many people thought that he had become mad.""  My audience suddenly became much more attentive.  ""The great chief wanted to know what was wrong with Hamlet, so he sent for two of Hamlet's age mates [school friends would have taken long explanation] to talk to Hamlet and find out what troubled his heart.  Hamlet, seeing that they had been bribed by the chief to betray him, told them nothing.  Polonius, however, insisted that Hamlet was mad because he had been forbidden to see Ophelia, whom he loved.""
     ""Why,"" inquired a bewildered voice, ""should anyone bewitch Hamlet on that account?""
     ""Bewitch him?""
     ""Yes, only witchcraft can make anyone mad, unless, of course, one sees the beings that lurk in the forest.""
     I stopped being a storyteller, took out my notebook and demanded to be told more about these two causes of madness.  Even while they spoke and I jotted notes, I tried to calculate the effect of this new factor on the plot.  Hamlet had not been exposed to the beings that lurk in the forest.  Only his relatives in the male line could bewitch him.  Barring relatives not mentioned by Shakespeare, it had to be Claudius who was attempting to harm him.  And, of course, it was.
     For the moment, I staved off questions by saying that the great chief also refused to believe that Hamlet was mad for the love of Ophelia and nothing else.  ""He was sure that something much more important was troubling Hamlet's heart.""
     ""Now Hamlet's age mates,"" I continued, ""had brought with them a famous storyteller.  Hamlet decided to have this man tell the chief and all his homestead a story about a man who had poisoned his brother because he desired his brother's wife and wished to be chief himself.  Hamlet was sure the great chief could not hear the story without making a sign if he was indeed guilty, and then he would discover whether his dead father had told him the truth.""
     The old man interrupted, with deep cunning, ""Why should a father lie to his son?"" he asked.
     I hedged: ""Hamlet wasn't sure that it really was his father.""  It was impossible to say anything, in that language, about devil-inspired visions.
     ""You mean,"" he said, ""it actually was an omen, and he knew witches sometimes send false ones.  Hamlet was a fool not to go to one skilled in reading omens and divining the truth in the first place.  A man-who-sees-the-truth could have told him how his father died, if he really had been poisoned, and if there was witchcraft in it; then Hamlet could have called the elders to settle the matter.""
     The shrewd elder ventured to disagree.  ""Because his father's brother was a great chief, one-who-sees-the-truth might therefore have been afraid to tell it.  I think it was for that reason that a friend of Hamlet's father - a witch and an elder - sent an omen so his friend's son would know.  Was the omen true?""
     ""Yes,"" I said, abandoning ghosts and the devil; a witch-sent omen it would have to be.  ""It was true, for when the storyteller was telling his tale before all the homestead, the great chief rose in fear.  Afraid that Hamlet knew his secret he planned to have him killed.""
     The stage set of the next bit presented some difficulties of translation. I began cautiously.  ""The great chief told Hamlet's mother to find out from her son what he knew.  But because a woman's children are always first in her heart, he had the important elder Polonius hide behind a cloth that hung against the wall of Hamlet's mother's sleeping hut.  Hamlet started to scold his mother for what she had done.""
     There was a shocked murmur from everyone.  A man should never scold his mother.
     ""She called out in fear, and Polonius moved behind the cloth.  Shouting, 'A rat!' Hamlet took his machete and slashed through the cloth.""  I paused for dramatic effect.  ""He had killed Polonius!""
     The old men looked at each other in supreme disgust.  ""That Polonius truly was a fool and a man who knew nothing!  What child would not know enough to shout, 'It's me!'""  With a pang, I remembered that these people are ardent hunters, always armed with bow, arrow, and machete; at the first rustle in the grass an arrow is aimed and ready, and the hunter shouts ""Game!""  If no human voice answers immediately, the arrow speeds on its way.  Like a good hunter Hamlet shouted, ""A rat!""
     I rushed in to save Polonius's reputation.  ""Polonius did speak.  Hamlet heard him.  But he thought it was the chief and wished to kill him to avenge his father.  He had meant to kill him earlier that evening...""   I broke down, unable to describe to these pagans, who had no belief in individual afterlife, the difference between dying at one's prayers and dying ""unhousell'd, disappointed, unaneled.""
     This time I had shocked my audience seriously.  ""For a man to raise his hand against his father's brother and the one who has become his father - that is a terrible thing.  The elders ought to let such a man be bewitched.""
     I nibbled at my kola nut in some perplexity, then pointed out that after all the man had killed Hamlet's father.
     ""No,"" pronounced the old man, speaking less to me than to the young men sitting behind the elders.  ""If your father's brother has killed your father, you must appeal to your father's age mates; they may avenge him.  No man may use violence against his senior relatives.""  Another thought struck him.  ""But if his father's brother had indeed been wicked enough to bewitch Hamlet and make him mad that would be a good story indeed, for it would be his fault that Hamlet, being mad, no longer had any sense and thus was ready to kill his father's brother.""
     There was a murmur of applause, <i>Hamlet</i> was again a good story to them, but it no longer seemed quite the same story to me.  As I thought over the coming complications of plot and motive, I lost courage and decided to skim over dangerous ground quickly.
     ""The great chief,"" I went on, ""was not sorry that Hamlet had killed Polonius.  It gave him a reason to send Hamlet away, with his two treacherous age mates, with letters to a chief of a far country, saying that Hamlet should be killed.  But Hamlet changed the writing on their papers, so that the chief killed his age mates instead.""  I encountered a reproachful glare from one of the men whom I had told undetectable forgery was not merely immoral but beyond human skill.  I looked the other way.
     ""Before Hamlet could return, Laertes came back for his father's funeral.  The great chief told him Hamlet had killed Polonius.  Laertes swore to kill Hamlet because of this, and because his sister Ophelia, hearing her father had been killed by the man she loved, went mad and drowned in the river.""
     ""Have you already forgotten what we told you?""  The old man was reproachful, ""One cannot take vengeance on a madman; Hamlet killed Polonius in his madness.  As for the girl, she not only went mad, she was drowned.  Only witches can make people drown.  Water itself can't hurt anything.  It is merely something one drinks and bathes in.""
     I began to get cross.  ""If you don't like the story, I'll stop.""
     The old man made soothing noises and himself poured me some more beer.  ""You tell the story well, and we are listening.  But it is clear that the elders of your country have never told you what the story really means.  No, don't interrupt!  We believe you when you say your marriage customs are different, or your clothes and weapons.  But people are the same everywhere; therefore, there are always witches and it is we, the elders, who know how witches work.  We told you it was the great chief who wished to kill Hamlet, and now your own words have proved us right.  Who were Ophelia's male relatives?""
     ""There were only her father and her brother.""  <i>Hamlet</i> was clearly out of my hands.
     ""There must have been many more; this also you must ask of your elders when you get back to your country. From what you tell us, since Polonius was dead, it must have been Laertes who killed Ophelia, although I do not see the reason for it.""
     We had emptied one pot of beer, and the old men argued the point with slightly tipsy interest.  Finally one of them demanded of me, ""What did the servant of Polonius say on his return?""
     With difficulty I recollected Reynaldo and his mission.  ""I don't think he did return before Polonius was killed.""
     ""Listen,"" said the elder, ""and I will tell you how it was and how your story will go, then you may tell me if I am right.  Polonius knew his son would get into trouble, and so he did.  He had many fines to pay for fighting, and debts from gambling.  But he had only two ways of getting money quickly.  One was to marry off his sister at once, but it is difficult to find a man who will marry a woman desired by the son of a chief.  For if the chief's heir commits adultery with your wife, what can you do?  Only a fool calls a case against a man who will someday be his judge.  Therefore Laertes had to take the second way: he killed his sister by witchcraft, drowning her so he could secretly sell her body to the witches.""
     I raised an objection.  ""They found her body and buried it.  Indeed Laertes jumped into the grave to see his sister once more - so, you see, the body was truly there.  Hamlet, who had just come back, jumped in after him.""
     ""What did I tell you?""  The elder appealed to the others.  ""Laertes was up to no good with his sister's body.  Hamlet prevented him, because the chief's heir, like a chief, does not wish any other man to grow rich and powerful.  Laertes would be angry, because he would have killed his sister without benefit to himself.  In our country he would try to kill Hamlet for that reason.  Is this not what happened?""
     ""More or less,"" I admitted.  ""When the great chief found Hamlet was still alive, he encouraged Laertes to try to kill Hamlet and arranged a fight with machetes between them.  In the fight both the young men were wounded to death.  Hamlet's mother drank the poisoned beer that the chief meant for Hamlet in case he won the fight.  When he saw his mother die of poison, Hamlet, dying, managed to kill his father's brother with his machete.""
     ""You see, I was right!"" exclaimed the elder.
     ""That was a very good story,"" added the old man, "" and you told it with very few mistakes.  There was just one more error, at the very end.  The poison Hamlet's mother drank was obviously meant for the survivor of the fight, whichever it was.  If Laertes had won, the great chief would have poisoned him, for no one would know that he arranged Hamlet's death.  Then, too, he need not fear Laertes' witchcraft; it takes a strong heart to kill one's only sister by witchcraft.""
     ""Sometime,"" concluded the old man, gathering his ragged toga about him, ""you must tell us some more stories of your country.  We, who are elders, will instruct you in their true meaning, so that when you return to your own land your elders will see that you have not been sitting in the bush, but among those who know things and who have taught you wisdom."""

The sun, symbolised by a young prince, is required to return to the princess the symbolic attribute which symbolises the union between the spring sun and nature, a fecund marriage from which will come the flowers and the fruits. Cinderella is the debris of an ancient religion or, as Andrew Lang says, the 'diamond dust of a myth.'""

"event","so Rachel went today to High Priestess Piercing to get titanium earrings and to repierce her 3rd hole. they had us waiting for awhile. I was thinking about tatoos that I would get one day. I was thinking about getting star outlines around all the moles on my tummy. cause right now it sorta looks like a constelation. so if I had stars around all my moles it reallly would be a constelation. I got really excited and happy thinking about that. and the guy was like, 'yeah could be anywhere from 80-200 dollars.' it was wonderful. but I'm not 18 yet and I don't think mom would go for tatoos. :(
I also want a serpent/snake tatoo and a pheonix tatoo. :)"

"event","ancient hunters
ate the 'strength' of the animal
the 'intelligence'.
so is it an ancient reason
why Jesus has us eat
his 'body'
and drink
his 'blood'?
very pagan, thanking the animal
for the kill
and it's sacrifice of death
so that the hunters can eat.
<br>
<p>we aren't so much
'here and now'
as we think we are.
<br>
<p>we're so fucking 'civilized'
that women are weak.
what happened to goddesses
like Diane?
the virgin silver huntress
or Hades' wife?
the Queen of Death
or Hecate?

"event","So I spent the night at Brit's after working with horses for four hours. Both activities were highly enjoyable - though my full tank of gas is now below half mark. I'm always happy hanging with Brit, but her life... hits rocks and I always feel really bad when she gets upset etc cause I care about her. I love you! I really do *hug. I hung with Justin and college friends and family today and that was really fun as well. Lyle told the most hilarious story during dinner and every single one of us starting laughing and someone leans over and asks 'Can I have a brownie?'. I heart family and friends. ^_^ I put in a job application for Market of Choice on Willamette and I'm nervous. I have stuff on hold at the library that I forgot to get. I miss certain family and friends. I have to read seven books before school starts. Capture-the-Flag is quite fun. Blisters are not. I wrote a cute/silly poem."

"event","Prom was very fun. It happened on the 20th. I actually started the night with a headache. I went with <lj user=""thor4life""> and surpriseingly enough, for dinner sucking horribly, it was quite fun! ^_^ We walked to prom cause we'd parked a little ways away. And <lj user=""chris_redfield8""> yelled at a group of people downtown and I got nervous, but they said something we couldn't hear so it was cool. Then dancing was fun. I was kinda wondering if Kevin was having a good time and then ""Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy"" came on and despite his protests of ""This song is forever ruined (etc)."" he seemed to loosen up after that and we had fun. He wanted pictures and so I was stubborn and made him pick. Then Justin drove him home. Yay good night.

First time ever being drunk. I went to the hotel with Tulcie, Amy, Josh, Preet, Justin came and Juven showed up later. Tulcie wanted everyone drunk. She was the hostess. Josh made me a drink. I was buzzed. Amy made me a drink and I was drunk. Wearing Amy's Looney Tunes boxers and a black tank top, we got up and danced to a commercial. Tulcie tried to take the rest of my second drink away but I wouldn't let her. ""No! You don't just want to try it! I know what you're doing! I did it to Bethany last night!"" I promised no more drinks. Later, when Tulcie offered me a drink, I said ""No more alcohol."" She brought me 7-Up. Josh brought me a water and tucked me into bed when I was falling asleep. It worked out so I got the whole room to myself. I slept in the bed closest to the bathroom. ^_^ But I slept like a rock! When I woke up I had a little headache. I filled the coffee pot with water and drank the whole thing while watching <i>Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>. I was bored. I also decided that drugs make me tired. When I was twice stoned I just wanted to sleep and when I was drunk I just wanted to sleep. Funny. Tulcie and Josh woke up and dropped me off at home after an interesting encounter with grandmas in the elevator. Wow, they pissed me off and made me laugh at the same time!!! I took a bath and threw up twice in the tub. At least I waited till I was home. I cleaned it and took another bath. lol

I wake up at 5 am on Monday and try to go downstairs for water. I pick up the waterbottle, fill it, as I'm trying to drink it, I'm walking up the stairs, accidentally turned on a light, which I can barely see because my eyes are shut or I'm only seeing black. I manage to shut off the light, then I hear a big noise and next I know, I'm lying on the floor with my left heel really hurting and my legs bent sideways, my arms awkwardly thrown, and my precious water seeping onto the carpet. Mom comes out of her room and stands there. I hold up my water and say ""I need water"". I rest while she fills it and brings it back. ""Can I shut off my alarm and sleep in mom?"" She says yes. Nice.

I'm out all week. Turns out I have mono. This sucks. I might not be able to go back to finish school. I have SAT on June 3. I won't be able to say bye to all my senior friends. I'm trying to go to bed when it gets dark outside. And drink lots of water."

"event","I threw a party for Cinco de Mayo cause mom was out of town. Sarah was going to come and help me clean right after school. She saw alcohol and put 1 and 1 together and got that I was having a party. She asked if she could bring some of her friends over. I said five friends would be fine. She and Howie wanted Chris, Matt, Stephanie and others. They left. My friends came. Sarah came back with before mentioned people and Sammi and Nirvana too. Amy told Tulcie that I didn't want them there (which was a lie). Tulcie came and talked to me and they all got into my hottub. She basically pressured me into kicking Chris and Matt out. Howie was arguing with me, wanting them to stay. I was actually fine with them staying, but Josh was the muscle and he was like you have to go now. So Sarah's whole group left. I felt really bad for kicking them all out."

"event","I'm an observer in this dream. And I've had variations of this dream before. Not all the same details, but same thread.

Three people in an underground room. Dark, rocks and rubble all around. A figure flashes past and scares the younger girl. The boy runs into the tunnel and the older girl helps the younger one into the tunnel. I'm closer to them now and can see their faces. Dawn is at some stairs that lead down only with a pencil in one hand, searching for what she knows is a female vampire named Darla. Buffy and the boy finish what they were doing in the tunnel and Buffy says, ""Careful, Dawn."" Darla pokes her head in and Dawn screams, jabbing the pencil into Darla's eye. Darla roars in pain and takes the pencil out as Dawn starts climbing down the stairs. Buffy jams her pencil into Darla's eye, searching for the brain, to kill. Darla jerks away and runs. Buffy and the boy climb down as well. Now, abovegorund in bright daylight, walking out of a big building that looks important, Dawn is being led by a new girl, out to safety. Walking by some pillars, gunfire is rained upon them. The girl falls on Dawn, protecting her. The boy had walked out as well and the fired at him too. Must kill everyone. All three lay, silent. The gunmen, satisfied that they are all dead, get up to check the bodies. The girl and guy get up, startling the gunmen who leave. There's a street musician laughing at Dawn and crew. The girl goes, grabs a sidewalk advertisement, and slams it into his head several times, until he's been knocked unconscious. A car pulls up. Dawn starts walking away. The guy and girl follow asking, ""Where are we going?"" Evan and another boy pass them on the path. Dawn keeps walking, ""To a book shop."" The girl and guy sigh, continue to follow her. They're in the woods now and pass a knoll/beaver dam looking thing. They go inside. There are theater seats and a foot of airspace leading down behind the chairs. Next I remember, Dawn is climbing up a dark, dank rock face. She'd transformed into a gecko/lizard thing. She hadn't found what she was looking for and didnt bring anything up with her. The girl says, ""Are you climbing or do you need a belay?"" Dawn's already up and sitting on the ledge, looking out the window at a female bear walking up the drive with a basket. Dawn was human again. The guy looks at where Dawn is looking and he turns into a bear too. The female bear opens the door and freezes. Dawn says, ""Hello, we're looking for a book.""

*Dawn, Buffy and Darla are all Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters, created by Joss Whedon and team"

Dante, my boyfriend in the dream, was sitting behind me, but they both seemed farther away. Dante noticed that I was staring at the black guy and got suspicious. I thought, 'Oh, no! I hope he doesn't find out I kissed someone else!' I look to a different guy, Terren, and find him looking at me too. I'm surprised and grateful. I get called to the front of the room {and I'm somewhere else. Definitely a basement-type place. Don't remember what happened except} I'm there with friends and Terren's there too. We hook-up, because Dante's already mad at me. On our way to Terren's house, I check back in the classroom. But Dante's gone."

"event","Thursday was my first day of summer with no school,  no classes, and no work to do. *side note: OMG! IT'S FUCKING HAILING - BIGGER THAN MY FINGERNAIL!!!* So what do I do? Hang out with Eric? Rachel? bake cookies? NO!!! I go to get my wisdom teeth pulled out!!! <sarcasm>Oh, what fun! Because I didn't want to go camping this summer! And I look totally hot with chipmunk cheeks! And drooling just turns Eric on! And I just love the fact that I can only eat yogurt, pudding, and the white part of hard boiled eggs!</sarcasm>

So I've spent the weekend at home, making Eric watch movies to get 'cultured', and not believing school is out. I feel like there's homework I should be doing.

It was lucky today was Father's Day, because we had lunch at Grandma's apartment palace and they were serving really good hot cross buns. I dipped mine in milk in order to eat it. Dad came down from Albany, Aunt Kathleen, Uncle Tom, and Liz were down from Bend for a wedding, and Uncle Dick, Jacob, and Gina came to lunch too. It was fun and at the same time boring. I was ready to leave as soon as I put my fork down, but oh well."

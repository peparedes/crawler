"event","wow you know how valentines usually sucks when you dont have a real valentine? well just so the world may be warned it sucks no matter what! so today is valentines day and i had to job shadow which wasnt bad bc i wasnt at school for half the day and then i had to go to school and every one has flowers from there friends and stuff and im all left out...sniff sniff...but after school i run over to joels and well i got him good today! he wasnt expecting a thing!!!! thank you allan! ne ways i hung out there for an hour and a half untill i had to work yes work! on valentines day... well moving on work sucked bc it was monday and no one comes in on mondays except when i have the slowest new girl ever!!! so not only were we incredably busy but i had to do my tables her tables my tickets her tickets and calm down her customers that were pissed bc of her... but joel came and sat in the waffel house for 3hours and 8 mins with me while i worked...so sweet i love him so very much...but at this point in time he hadnt given me any thing so i was kinda pissed about that...so...every thing is a mess in the waffle and the next shift people come in and start complaining so i had to saty after 30 mins to clean up the new girls messes!! then i went out to my car with joel and he gives me 4 roses (3 for the past 3 months and 1 for the future) and a card he made! very sweet but im still pissed bc of waffle drama...on the way home i have the music really loud and im singing like crazy and going way to fast and guess what happends...i get pulled over! my first ticket for going 21 over...bad cara...so now joel is waitingfor me at my house and we only get to spend 15 mins together :( but it was a great 15 mins bc i love him so much and he loves me! but yes valentines is great when you live in neverland but if your here on earth chances are it will have its major ups and downs...I love you all and HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!"

"event","Every Time
by: Joel Bowman
Every time i look into your eyes i feel loved
Every time i kiss you i feel like i belong to you
  belong to you   belong to you

Every time when i go to sleep i toss and turn 
cause you are not next to me
Every time i'm scared i call and you are there to comfort me
  comfort me   comfort me

So i thank you for being there
  to hold me  to hold me
and i pray to hold you forever and ever
  even into heaven

so this might be the best present ive ever gotten...for all you guys that have no idea what to get for that special someone...a song or poem from the heart is most deffinetly a good thing!!

thank you joel i love you so much"

In the land that is plentiful 
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

Blessed Be Your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed Be Your name

Every blessing You pour out 
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

Blessed be Your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's 'all as it should be'
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name
On the road marked with suffering 
Though there's pain in the offering 
Blessed be Your name

Every blessing You pour out 
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord

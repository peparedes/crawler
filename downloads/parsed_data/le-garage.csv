<center><small>It's warm.</small></center>

p.s. i saw a guy that had hair like albert hammond jnr.



lolol. i keep such stupid stuff. i found my huuuuuge bundle of photos i keep and there's ones from my 14th birthday sleepover with Lauren, Karen, Kathleen and I. It's so funny, Kathleen's hair is short and Karen's is long. There's a picture of Kathleen, me and Lauren all standing on my bed in flannel pyjamas with our arms round each other like WOO!! hahah i remember we watched the last episode of sex and the city that night too. and lolololol the funniest thing EVER kathleen was taking a picture of lauren karen and i and my mum came in and karen lmao i don't even know what she was doing but she was wiggling around on the bed sqealing and we were all laughing too much to tell her to stop and that my mum was standing watching like wth's going on. it was so funny.

it's so odd how much has changed in the last year and no one could have ever imagined it. so what the hell will things be like this time next year?

time is one hell of a headfuck."

"event","ok slightly more coherant entry than last time, but yes I did get Strokes tickets, yeah baby. 

Soooo. I was going to update with all the exciting things happening in my life but then i realised there are none :) Except I'm going SHOPPING with Kate tomorrow at HALF 12!!1! Early for me :P Anyhow. Ok so exciting things...wait. None. So I'm going deep.

I love suburbia. I love pavements and puddles and people smoking and newsagents and things that aren't talked about by glamorous people or in Hollywood films. I love trains at night and tubs of vaseline. I love carparks and trainstations and sofas and livingrooms. I love bathroom cabinets and freshly changed duvets. I love sharing ice cream out a tub and eating the whole lot. I love happy times. I love remembering things. I love being sad just so something can make you happy again. That feeling of remembering you are happy and that life is good and there's something to look forward too even if it's just listening to a song that can make you happy for three minutes. I love when you meet new people even if it's just for two minutes. Freinds of friends. Just introductions even if you only see them once. People at gigs who smile at you or help you up when you're knocked over. People who talk to you even though they have no idea who you are. It makes me smile so much. I love books and bookshops and when you buy a new book and you carry it around all day and you go home and do your thing and then you finally get to start reading it and it's just something completely new, something you've never done before. I want that on a bigger scale. 

i also love leg wazing for charity ;] Superman!!!!! <33333333

"event","Hello my pretties =]

wellll this weekend has been pretty uneventful.
On friday Karen, Lauren and I went to Kate's to see her kitten!! Indii and Poppy! They're actually the cutest. We took lots of stupid webcam pics. I shall post them later ;] Not all 300 though...
Thennnnn we all went our seperate ways until kate came up to mine and we walked down towards the Beanscene and who did we meet but Gianni! Soo he came with us and Kate and I to meet Lauren. Kate & I got our caffe mochas and found out the Ronelles are playing in the Beanscene next friday (!) so we're going to that. After HARRY POTTER!! Yes, I am cool.

Soooooo we met Euam and Kathleen and meandered down to Lauren's. I did the geekeiest thing, I got my lip caught on my brace lmao. 
Yeah Lauren's t'was fun. We fucked about watching music channels then Kathleen straightened Gianni's hair, which he suprisingly suited :P 
Afterwards I had to stay at my gran's and I watched Maximo Park on Jools Holland :D and Daniel Radcliffe on Johnathon Ross! He's so geeky! I love him :D It was so good. I admit it, I'm actually rather excited about the new movie. Make rather very actually. Ahem.

Thennnnnnn went to mon pere's yesterday. Cats were shit scared of the fireworks, poor dears. I felt sick so I went to bed and listened to Pulp and the Smiths all night. Asleep is just the most perfect song ever. I love it. The way Morrissey doesn't quuuuite pronounce the ""p"" at the end of ""sleep"". Sigh. And I just love all of Different Class :]

Anddddd today I was chucked out of my house due to the plasterers and stuff putting scaffolding all the way up the stairs, therefore giving us no access at all to the bedrooms, bathroom or computer. So in fact I've not been in my house all day, as I am at Lauren's right now. I'm meant to be doing her french homework. I've done half of it lol. We're discussing my odd family. I love it =] 

Lalalalaa. I have done no homework yayyyy go me. I'm hoping to get limewire tonight. Whoop.

"event","Ok I really can't be bothered writing all about Gianni's like I said I would and I really do want to write about every single moment of contact any of us had with Fergus but I'm not going to, I'll leave that and continue spazzing about it with Kathleen & Lauren. But highlights included - 

-Actually hearing Gianni playing guitar. He is acutally so amazing at it :] 
-John playing Don't Look Back Into The Sun =]
-Singing along to James Brown, Queen, the Who and THE CLASH. I was sitting next to Fergus at this point and sharing a beer with him and Karen. But that is beside the point.
-Fergus playing Wolfman on bongos and not knowing it lollll
-Playing frisbee in the street at 3 in the morning lolol then losing it in someones garden lolllll
-Racing around Green's carpark and feeling like hooligans at the phonebox in the early hours 
-Watching the Sing Language people on music tv lolllllll! 
-Quotes Of The Night ;] They were so hilariously funny at the time I promise. -

Sean - ""I love the sound of a can opening. It's so attractive.""
Gerrard - ""I don't like eating sausages in other peoples houses.""
Gianni - ""I know we're not twelve year old girls in our underwear but....let's have a pillowfight!""
""It's because I have such good relexes"" *falls off bed* lolllllololol
""Karen, your family are just like the VonTrappe family""
me - ""Except they're not being chased by Nazis""
Gerrard - ""Muhmmgmpogpph.....""
Gianni - ""Imuphhgh uhimphh..."" [this was about half five and they were losing the ability to speak.]

I'm sure there was way more but I can't remember right now. 
-Gianni being such a morning person! lol! We all woke up at around 10 after 2 and a half hours sleep and Gianni was wide awake and made us all bacon sandwiches awwwwww ^_^ 
- Gianni's bird foot slippers looooollllllllll

Ok there probably was way more stuff [including ever interaction with a certain drunk boy] but that's all I'm gonna bore you with =]

And I love Kathleen's indieness back YAY!

Indie boys at it like rabbits, baby ;]
that's the way we like 'em. 

Sooo today Kathleen & myself are no doubt going to spazz about that certain drunk boy once more and watch Disney/chick flick movies and eat chocolate and stuff of that variety =]

Today was fun, if, a little wet. Skully & I ventured to the West End to go to Watermelon, which is a rather quite little shop. Went to try and get Lauren a present too, in Oscar & Felix or whatever, then realised we couldn't afford anything at all lmfao. Damn, so many dead ends! Exrament bag, please, Kathleen. Hahahhhhhh. We were so poor we were thinking of stealing from the rubbish outside the Beanscene bit. Hahah, I hadn't been in that wee bit for ages, I used to go with my dad & Helen all the time 'cos there's this wee antique shop where Helen got some of our furniture. And I remember when we lived in Penicuik (sp? hahah) there used to be this shop called ""Junk Shop"" and it wasjust the most amazing wee shop and upstairs there was an antique book shop, I loved it. Helen bought original copies of a few Dikens stuff & other stuff. Aww man, good times they were. I loved that house. I could probably still take you there from the Royal Mile. If you ever want. Hahah, even though I don't live there any more...I've had quite a few houses...3 with both parents, 2 with my mum, 4 with my dad. Nine houses. Then we're moving somewhere in the country when Brian stops work late in a year or so. Then I'll move out. 

Anthony Corr is listening to the Clash. <b>wtf</b> According to Kathleen anyway...I don't have such people on my contact list, thanks v much. Rock The Casbah...intersting. Hahah, weird, that song reminds me of one of my Dad's flats 'cos I remember listening to it for the first time and knowing it was the Clash. & That was also the first place I listened to the Cure. Good times, I tell thee.

I can't stand Michael McDevvit.

I have just found Carl singing Can't Stand Me Now on his own. His voice is sexy but rather sad, if thruth be told.

Well LAUREN'S BIRTHDAY TOMORROW! She'll be as old as meeeee. Only not quite.

"event","i wish i could marry the Smiths. 
I wish I was Morrissey. I would have such a wonderful way with words.

Actually saying that is probably kind of creepy, what I mean to say is, I wish I has a way of words such as Morrissey's.

i'm scaring myself. 

you know who i like. no that's wrong. 

rawrrrrrrr. 

i'm awake. 

i like feeling like i am morrissey. not in a creepy way, but just when you put words together in a normal sentance and they sound good. 
i sound like such a freak. sometimes i wonder about myself but then i realise i hate thinking about myself hahah.

<P>Soooooo what's been happening? Got my hair cut this morning, I have a fringe again. Well I can, but I can move it about. Flexible fringes. I like. Weird, the girl who washed my hair is Kelly Callender's cousin, and goes to the same school as me. We had a wee chat. And my hairdresser (John, who is lovely btw) his wife came in with their wee baby, she's so cute! Anyhoo.</P>
<P>Went to EAST KILBRIDE!!!!!!!1!111!!!!!! I never go there. With my sister and her wee pal, aren't I cool? I got a yella n brown stripey polo-top type thing. Noice. </P>
<P>Mmmhhmmm. Oh yeah I got Oceans Elven, Mean Girls, Dodgeball and Donnie Darko on DVD. Woop woop.</P>
<P>THEN I got home and packed my suitcase 'cos I'm off to Spain the morra!! HUZZAH!! Ach, that reminds me of Skuwyin. Missin her so I am. Och well. She'll be back when I'm back =D ooh this is where I am going. <A href=""http://www.openholidays.co.uk/accommodation/can_geroni.htm"">http://www.openholidays.co.uk/accommodation/can_geroni.htm</A></P>

<P>Ohh, I met Katie today, what a lovely wee thing she is =) Awww she is lovely.</P>
<P>Hmmm, I was so sure I had something interesting to say for once but I can't remember. </P>
<P>G8 rally in Edinburgh tomorrow.....I'm very very glad I'm not going. It looks scary. So many people in like, one street. They've closed off Arthur street like they do at hogmaney and there's going to be more people in those streets than the whole population of Edinburgh, probably...sigh. Well at least I'll be on a plane....</P>

Today was allright. Had dayfever though >=( So did Lauren awwwwww she couldn't wear make up awwwwww =P Mrs McBearty asked her what an orgy was today, followed by ""My experience of an orgy was........"" which should never ever EVER be said by any English teacher. Oh sigh. Lol, we saw everyone rehersing for the school show (My Fair Lady) and first break Kathleen was in her ballroom -scene outfit then at lunch her cockney outfit lolol awwwwww. Good luck to everyone in the show by the waaaaaay. I'm seeing it on Wednesday should be a larf n a harf. 
Sooooo after school Euan and Sean and Johnny and Michael McDevvit or however it's spelt were being like GUYS! Sean rugby tackled Euan to the ground lolol :P Aye, so I didn't want to walk with Michael McDevvit so I walked up to Ross'ss's's' with Macadam to try and get him to buy school show tickets which he didn't but we went in and met his sister who is lovely BUT I LEFT MY PHONE AT ROSS'S >=( I think...anyhoo, Macadam went home and Ross's sister, Ross and I walked up the road and Ross was given life advice by his sister awwww ^_^ Ross andhis sister talk the same. Not like, accents but like, tey word things the same way sort of. I dunno how I noticed that :\ anyways. I need my phone back :| 
Soooo I came home and watched the Smiths who were on MTV2 and I danced along to Panic while making my dinner and eating strawberries. Nice. I CAN'T EVEN MAKE CHEESE ON TOAST! Omg, that actually really upset me, I burnt it and all the cheese went every where. Oh sigh. I really am pretty much useless. 

Soo my dad phoned and said he's gonna try and get tickets for Franz at T @t he Fringe, I hope the wednesday though, cos Arcade Fire are supporting that night ^_^

Under the cut :)

Lots of Pete.
<lj-cut>
So, the Skanky girl and her fat friend were in front of us. Skank left to go to the toilet and she came back ans starts like, pushing us. Somehow, I can't remember, she ended up arguing with Annie, who had done nothing wrong at all, but then she just turned round, pissed off. We just kinda stood there in silence, and then we heard Skanky say ""They don't know Pete's ma cousin, A 'hink a'll phone 'im and tell 'him tae get these lassie chucked oot ur somethin. But keep quiet about it 'cuz Kate's here and a 'hink there's press around.""

What a fucking load of bullshit.

We just stood behind her, laughing our fucking asses off. But then, she got her phone out, so we'r like, let's see what she's gonna do now. So The Fat Friend says something like ""Does he know your in the crowd? Phone him and tell him yer rightin front of his mic!"" and then skanky goes ""Yeah, a'll ask him if he's goat any smack on him too""
Oh.my.fucking.god. what a fucking load of shite.
All the time we were listening to her dillusions, there was this DJ, Joe Malik, or something, and he played really good stuff, the Strokes, the Cure, the Doors and then he played Time For Heroes and everyone went crazy, it was so lovely just to hear everyone sing all the words. 
Then. The fucking Fire Engines/River City guy came on.
I'm not going to spare too much time writing about them, they were just awful. The ""singer"" was about 40 something and bald, wearing god knows what, doing all this sleazy, Iggy Pop style dancing, it was just awful. But ohmygod, skanky and her pal were like, dancing, jumping up and down and screaming and shit, and then she starts shouting ""GEEZ A DRINK!! OI! GIVE US A DRINK!"" to the guy, so he threw a bottle of water to her and she goes ""Pete must of told him to do that!""
OhMyGod, we were just killing ourselves laughing, she was just completely dillusional. And her bra strap snapped lmao.
Finally the first act went off. So the lovely little DJ came back on ^_^ and played more good music. And still, Skank and Co. danced and jumped. Fatty, who was about 40 and right in front of Annie, kept jumping up and down, jiggling her ass in Annie's face, practically, and Annie found this so disgusting she shouted ""I'VE GOT AN ERECTION!"" and was then told to control herself by Kathleen. But then, fatty herself turned round and so politely said ""Gonnae move back! Are ye tryin tae shag us up the arse ur somethin'?!"" to which Annie replied ""Oh yeah, it's just so irresistible! I can't control myself!"" completely straight faced, it was so funny, but Skank and Fatty didn't seem to think so, and Skank replied ""Du know how tae fight?"" and she ended up threatening Annie and completely causing a show of herself. But in the end she turned round and shut up. And I got a smile of one of the emo boys. But that's irrelevent. Anyways. Then finally, after more dillusions from Skank (""Just act like fans, take pictures and stuff"", ayr, sure mate), Pete came on. 
He came on, acoustic guitar in hand. Suit and tie. He apologised for being a bit late. Then he played. 
I can't remember everything he played, but here are a few, in almost the right order.

~ East of Eden
~ Don't look back into the sun
~ Mockingbird
~ Arcady
~ I Love you (but you're green)
~ Time For Heroes
~ Albion
~ Can't Stand Me Now
~ Should I Stay Or Should I Go? (theClash)
~ the Good Old Days
& more that I can't remember right now.

He played libertines stuff.

He played Up The Bracket stuff.

He played Don't Look Back Into The Sun. 

He read everyones letters, took everyones gifts with thanks, he was just amazing and wonderful and beautiful.
Everyone just adored him, even the skank couldn't ruin the night for us. I got photos, I got a video of ""Albion"". 
Everything was just perfect, he couldn't have been better. All acoustic, all Pete. 

I don't really know what else to say about it, I can't really put it into words.
But, the gig ended, and Pete left the stage. 

Everyone left the venue on a total high, you could feel it. It was like Pete brought something in the air with him, everyone was buzzing. 

So we got outside and we went down to the stage door, down this wee alley thing. Some people were already there, some followed us. After a fwe minutes it there was quite a small crowd of us, and there was a group of studenty looking, lovely looking, indie looking boys, who we had seen in the queue with us, 
started singing, I think they started with the ""shoop shoop, shoop de lang de langs"" from What Katie Did, and within a few minutes, everyone was joining in, singing and laughing in the drizzly rain, everything from Time For Heroes, For Lovers, The Man Who Came To Stay to This Charming Man by the wonderful Smiths and Someday by theStrokes to quoting Max Carlish, and laughing at the stupidity of it all. It was strangely, but wonderfully, beautiful, in a way. 
Then one of the guys, called Alan I found out, found a ladder. A very, very old, wooden ladder. Alan was rather small for his age. He proped the ladder up against the stage door, and climbed up, with people holding onto the ladder for dear life, and managed to grab hold of this wire that was going across the building and sort of tried to swing his way up to a window on it, but it snapped and he just fell onto the ladder again. So he gave up on that plan. Then someone found traffic cones and tried to use them as microphones, singing into them. One of the guys, they were calling him Peter, I dunno if that was his name, of just cos he was singing like him, he was the loveliest guy, he had a blue blazer and lovely hair, and he carried a brown leather statchel filled with lollipops and biros, and he carried an umbrella everywhere, he was just the cutest, he was also english, I think he must of been a student. Anyways, he asked me if I'd seen Pete before and I told him and he told me he was at that gig and got beaten up by a security gaurd :| I was like, riight....why? and he goes ""It was so fun!"" I was like awww.iloveyou ^_^. Except i didn't say that...And a blonde guy tried to chat Annie up with the line ""I'm sorry, but do you have a tissue?"" and by luck, Annie did, and the guy waslike ""WOAH THANKS SO MUCH!!!"" and gave her a hug and 2 kisses on the cheek, and by the time we left Annie was half convinced it was fate to meet him again in Glasgow ^__^ There was so many more people, and just the little conversations, like the guy who sort of looked like Gordon from Bloc Party, but with glasses, who kept having to come back and chase his friend because he wanted to leave, but his friend didn't, there was so many little things that made everyone feel so, I don't know how to put it really, sort of, conected with each other, everyone was just so happy. 

After a while, we left all the indie boys and girls and went home, still on a complete high.

I applaud you if you read all that.

I'm going to do a pretty long entry about Ayr, so for all you lazy people who can't be bothered to read it, here's a very much shortened version.

One of the best nights of my life.

<lj-cut>

Right, so. 

Macadam and me got the 12 train into town, in the hope of buying Karen a, truth be told, incredibly late birthday card, and to get everyone from their band to sign it for her, without her seeing. Which was looking to be pretty impossible. So, we got into town and wandered round in the rain looking for a card, which we eventually got, then we ran all the way to central through puddles and hitting people with umbrellas, to get the band people in central before they left. So we got to central and it proved to be our lucky day as KAREN MISSED THE TRAIN!! :D So we could get all the band people to sign it without the worry of her seeing us. And I met Ivan! :O not see him in like, forever. Anyway, we got everyone to sign the card, blah blah blah, even a random emo called Martyn :\ anyway. Yeah so, me and Madam got the half two train back to Williamwood and o.m.g it was packed full of football fans, half D.U.F.C and hald Celtic :| so we thought we found a almost empty bit to stand in at the celtic bit, but then it got packed again, and it was pretty scary cos it was all these men drinking and yelling football chants and stuff and we were just standing like :| ..... but then they got to Mount Florida and the wole carriage just emptied. Like, completely. It was so strange. Anyways. 

Got back to Laura's, and then we went up to Kathleens. Yay :D So we got all ready and set off to Ayr :D 
Driving taking pictures, fun fun fun. 
SO. We got to AYR. I am sorry. but seriously. I am NEVER going to live in Ayr. We found the town hall there was no one there so we just stood about, and tried to spot out of towners, it was so easy, because everyone who had some sense of indie/style about them, you could tell was there to see Pete. It was absolutely freezing so we went into this little coffee house, called Pandora's or something, and even though the woman was just shuting it up, she made us tea and got us cakes and stuff, awww ^_^ So we went back out to the cold, and warmed up cosiderably. THEN. Macadam got the camera out :D lmao, we did our girl band/gangsta poses and felt like tourists. Then some obvious out of towners, due to their wonderfully indie sense of style, started to stand around the other side of the doorway, and then omg, this security guy came over and said ""If you're here for the preformance, can you join the queue please"". and we're like :O no way!! But 'cos there was only a group of pretty hot guys in front of us. So we joined the queue which grew considerably, and involved some sneaky photo taking of the indie boys in front of us. Then O.M.G. Then we met THE SKANK. This girl, and I use the term loosely, she was past it, one of the guys in front of us was wearing this really hot hat, and this skank was (who, btw, was wearing a tiny denim skirt, a tiny black halterneck top, knee high pointy boots, and a Playboy bag. In Ayr. It was freezing. She also looked like a rat/heroin addict of 40 years) anyway, she was like ""hey you, let me wear yer hat!"" and he's like :\.....""why...."" and she said ""aww jist go on!! pleeease!! I'll make yer day if ye let us wear it!"" and he's just like :| ""no.."" and kinda turned away. Sensible boy. I so didn't take a picture of him. He had the fair trade logo on his hand, I mean, how could that not be hot on a young guy? 
We had been standing in the cold for almost three hours, and Annie decided to go to the ""Clubhouse"" (the place to be in Ayr, guys!) for the toilet, and oh so typical, the queue started to move. And Annie had the tickets. So effin typical. But, juuuust in time, she got back before we went through the doors. We were told to go upstairs and we got given wristbands, which I am still wearing btwz, and we were shown through to this hall. And we realised, it was a gig. Like, a proper, support act, beer drinking, etc, etc. So we got into the hall and people were just starting to stand around and we got to second from the front, right in front of the mic. But, lo and behold, the Skanky girl was in front of us, with her 200stone friend. 

I'm going to leave it there for now, and I applaud you if you read it all
LovePeace&Happiness

5th Paragraph down.
Didn't happen. He didn't say that.
I was there. 
Second from the front. 
Big update later. 
But.

Someone in the crowd shouted ""PETE! A FUCKING TRUE FUCKING LIBERTINE!"" or something
and a skanky girl in front of me shouted ""FUCK THE LIBERTINES!""
and pete looked at her, sort of shocked, and said ""fuck the libertines?"" as a question to her. Not as a statement.

"event","To be lost in the forest 
To be cut adrift 
You've been trying to reach me 
You bought me a book 
To be lost in the forest 
To be cut adrift 
I've been paid 
I've been paid 

Don't get offended 
If I seem absent minded 
Just keep telling me facts 
And keep making me smile 
Don't get offended 
If I seem absent minded 
I get tongue-tied 
Baby, you've got to be more discerning 
I've never know what's good for me 
Baby, you've got to be more demanding 
I will be yours 

I'll pay for you anytime 

You told me you wanted to eat up my sadness 
Well jump on, enjoy, you can gorge away 
You told me you wanted to eat up my sadness 
Jump right 
Baby, you've got to be more discerning 
I've never know what's good for me 
Baby, you've got to be more demanding 
Jump left 

What are you holding out for? 
What's always in the way? 
Why so damn absent minded? 
Why so scared of romance? 

This modern love breaks me 
This modern love wastes me 

Do you wanna come over and kill some time? 
Throw your arms around me"

<br>
<br>
I am now a Level III certified rowing coach. Whooop de doo, basically;
rowing coaches still get paid very little to have far too much
responsibility for the physical safety and mental and emotional
well-being of our rowers. It can be a life and death sport.&nbsp; I get
paid $15/hour, after ten years of coaching and holding a Level III
certification in the US and Level II in Canada.<br>
<br>
Do what you love, basically.<br>
<br>
I went to the USRowing National Convention in Baltimore last weekend to
take the Level III course. It was a good weekend.&nbsp; I got to meet
several national team coaches and athletes and talk to some very
talented and intelligent people. The coach of the women's crew at Navy
was pretty remarkable, actually, and very inspiring.<br>
<br>
Some of it was annoying, though.&nbsp; Here's an example:  

""What do junior boys think about all the time?  Junior girls!""  

<br>
<br>
Yeah. Unless they're GAY, you insensitive twit. Like some gay teenager
doesn't have it bad enough, their coach is going to pass THIS message
onto them, boy or girl.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The USRowing coach education system needs to have a few things added, in my opinion, to wit:

<br>
1. Don't fuck your rowers (this is such an enormous problem and the
topic was given a grand total of 30 oblique seconds, with no
discussion)
<br>
2. Don't assume your athletes, your colleagues, or anyone else for that
matter, are exclusively heterosexual just because it makes you more
comfortable to think so.
<br>
3. Learn about and maintain appropriate emotional boundaries with your
athletes. If you don't know what that means, then you need to find out.
<br>
4. Teaching others requires you to understand yourself, which is an
ongoing process and would be greatly assisted by a good therapist. <br>
<br>
Yep.  That'll really go over well with the old boys network that currently rules the elite coaching ranks.<br>

"event","I spent eight hours yesterday playing paintball.&nbsp; What better
place to be in November in the Pacific Northwest than out in the woods,
sliding around in the mud and dead leaves, shooting at your friends
through the brush?&nbsp; Nothing better, nosiree.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To add to the surreal quality of the day, The Perfect Man provided a
grill and some meat that he had killed, and so I found myself eating
charred wild antelope for lunch.&nbsp; With my bare hands.&nbsp; It was
really tender and tasted wonderful.&nbsp; And went well with M&amp;M's
and potato chips and apples and all the other stuff we brought.&nbsp;
Food tastes better outside, I think.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Of course, I am so sore today that I could barely walk.&nbsp; I think it was all the crouching and
the running while crouching and
the fear and adrenaline coursing through me while I was crouching and
running.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going down
stairs is a jarring experience, I have to keep my legs straight and sort of Frankenstein my way down
using the walls.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I had a really great time, though.&nbsp; I discovered that I have the
mentality
of a sniper.&nbsp; Crazy Bob, in contrast,
played fearlessly and suicidally and would often put down his gun and
just run for the flag, hoping that he would be fast enough and his
teammates would provide cover fire and
maybe even that god would protect him. He had some spectacular deaths
as a result, once with his gun held overhead and his body shaking with
the impact of many little paint bursts at once, like a scene from a war
movie.<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><br>
<br>
The most surreal part of the day, though, was on the drive home.&nbsp;
I was dozing in the back of the truck and we were talking about
antelope and how their antlers are really not horns, but densely matted
hair.&nbsp; I mused something aloud, asking why would that have
evolved?&nbsp; And The Perfect Man said ""Because it was
Created that way.""&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I had forgotten for a moment that he is a devout Christian and takes
the Bible literally, or nearly so.&nbsp; I don't know if I imagined the chill in his voice.  It was like peering through
the brush and seeing someone you think is on your side taking aim at
your head.<br>
<br>
Later on I encouraged him to go see Brokeback Mountain.&nbsp; I told him that it was a cowboy movie.&nbsp; <br>

"event","My stepgrandfather died this week.  I visited with him this summer and knew it was probably the last time I would see him.  My stepbrother sent the email to my sister about Granel, which she forwarded to me.  I do not grieve for him, we were not close, but I do remember him.

My mother is not going to the funeral because her ex-husband and his current and previous wives will be there. It makes me think about my family.

This is part of my family story.  All of these things are true.  

My mother Nancy is an alcoholic, though she is currently clean and sober and has been for many years. She married twice in her life, both times to men who were also alcoholics. 

Jim, my mother's first husband, was a smart, handsome, charming man. Witty and warm, he could make you feel like the most beautiful and intelligent woman in the world.&nbsp; He also had a bad temper and a sadistic streak and could inflict as much damage with his wit as he could with his hands.&nbsp; Jim had extramarital affairs with more than one of my mother's friends and probably other people as well during their entire decade of marriage, apparently. My mother says that she remained friends with the women who slept with her husband my father because <span style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">by god, your father was not going to take my friends away from me too.</span> 

My father died of brain tumors when I was a senior in college. He never remarried and though he had a couple of relationships after divorcing
my mother none of them lasted for very long.

We were raised Episcopal but there was no real faith in my family.

When Jim and Nancy divorced my mother married Lew, an old college flame, within a year; this raises the question of whether they had been in touch before the divorce, whether my mother had an affair of her own before her first marriage ended. Most likely she did, at least emotionally. Lew was a handsome man too, quieter than my father but also had a bad temper.  He was a big man, built like a quarterback, with big hands.  I don't think he was happy unless he was using his hands, mainly to garden or use tools related to gardening, or to hold guns.  Lew had at least one affair during his marriage to my mother with a woman we nicknamed ""Crazy Mary"" who lived in Philadelphia while we were living in Lancaster. I am pretty sure he also had an affair with one of my mother's friends, Judy. After divorcing my mother, Lew had a long relationship with Judy and my mother and sister both remained friends with her. Lew is now married to Crazy Mary and raises sheep in Vermont and is apparently still drinking and Judy has apparently gone a little crazy herself.

Mom went through alcohol rehabilitation while I was in law school and has remained sober since then.  She does not have an answer to the
question ""Why did you drink?""  She still lives in Lancaster. She maintained a relationship with Nana and Granel for more than twenty years, since she was divorced from Lew.

There are some deep feelings that stir quietly as I write this. 

Though I am not grieving for Granel, I spent some time today remembering him.    

He had very big hands.

He loved the Muppets.  

I remember that we used to watch the Muppets together and I remember that he would laugh at the two old men up in the balcony. I think they
were his favorite characters. He said that TV would make you ""mush brained"" but that the Muppets were ok. 

That's how I will remember Granel.

I wondered what it would be like for a life to end.  Would there be things left unresolved or does death resolve everything?"

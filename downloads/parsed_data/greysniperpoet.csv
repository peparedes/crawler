i told him that i thought our relationship was summed up in the She Wants Revenge song, Tear You Apart. it's sexual, it's kinky, it's about two people that are drawn to each other undeniably. 
B came back with Depeche Mode's ""It's No Good"". Oh my goddess, this just blows me away with all the feels: 

I'm going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above
The gods decree
You'll be right here by my side
Right next to me
You can run, but you cannot hide

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'cause it's no good

I'll be fine
I'll be waiting patiently
Till you see the signs
And come running to my open arms
When will you realize
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide
Open up your eyes
You can't turn back the tide

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'cause it's no good

I'm going to take my time
I have all the time in the world

Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me

"event","i've been re-reading Stephen King's <u>Dark Tower</u> series; it is one of my top favorite stories, and i don't consider myself a King fan. i'm done with the first five, but the sixth and seventh book are the long and arduous and painful portions of story--i haven't been able to touch them yet. i've read other books in the meantime, but book six is there by my pillow every night when i climb into bed. it's a reluctance to finish it, a wistfulness to remain at a point when the characters are still safe and happy and strong, and perhaps a hope that it will end differently this time combining with the fear that it will not. 

every person is on a quest. 
this is our life, our only life we are sure of having, and we don't know how long it will last or what will happen to us along the way. there are elements of control, parameters of possibility; which seem to widen and narrow as we move along. 
i have been realizing that accepting adulthood is in many ways accepting the compartmentalization of the possible realities available to you as you move forward in time. perhaps feeling dissatisfied with where life, chance, and your choices have lead explains how loving children become callous adults. we are so far past the day when a person could read every book every published. we have to decide where we will specialize and invest our time, and each decision makes it harder and less probable we will be able to accomplish the thing on the other end of the spectrum. 
few people are fortunate enough to have a strong sense of purpose, and even less have the opportunity of achieving their purpose. through the support, sacrifice, and encouragement of my family i am a rare soul who has both.
for so long i was approaching that actualization. but now, the large part of my life i spent striving to begin my career is over. i am starting my third year of 'living the dream', and presumably the only thing stopping me is me. i find it daunting in the cusp of the year; the deep solitude of Winter (such a shift from the buzzing dance of life the other three seasons) provides time to reflect and prepare for the activity to come, but it also gives space to hesitate and feel overwhelmed with the weight of what is ahead. 
i'm not alone, right? many people struggle to take the next step before them. so why do i feel like such a failure in those moments? i think of what my parents have done to prepare me, all my loved ones who are proud and excited to see what i make of myself, and finally the expectations i have for myself and my vision of who i may be; and the fear of disappointment is a wave covering my head. 

THREE WEEKS LATER

I have finished Song of Susannah (the sixth book). I am shaking off my paralysis and jumping back into the fray. I have taken action. I have rallied my support structure. 
'one step at a time' is the mantra.
if Roland's ka-tet can take on the Crimson King, i can handle my end of things, right? 
i am trying to set aside worrying about all the things i do not have time for (will i ever finish that novel??) and focus on dividing the monuments of my life into small steps. 
i am so lucky. i have family and friends who love and support me, a fantastic partner who goes to great lengths to make me happy, and a life i chose (as much as one is able). there is no reason to rush, i am living my dreams and i must soak up every precious moment. 
perhaps it is good to have these moments of feeling overwhelmed, to feel shaken and humble and desperate. when i gather my strength to push on it is with the sense of perspective easily lost in the rush of life, and with a renewed pride in where i am in this time--this moment. 
i sing your praises, Oh-Universe.
i celebrate my part in THIS; i pray that i add to the balance of good and love."

holding the ghost of you
close to my heart, 

you still live there
still laughing and crying
dancing or solemn  
a simultaneous compression of every remaining memory of you,
a clockworks of regret nestled tight and quiet.

i cannot stop
hoping the ghosts in you
have been left far behind;

dried up in the desert;
even less than a memory:
no witness to your freedom--
bound like wings on race horses,
twinkling in your soft elephant eyes,
curling the corners of your lips where once they pressed down.

your metamorphosis immaculate and unyielding. 

i cannot stop 
holding the ghost of you
as a talisman,
as one holds a coin fervently
before dropping that wish into unknown depths,
willing it to rise as a star in another world."

the radish gone woody, the green leaf lettuce is bolting to seed.
council of tomato grow dark and stately, proudly topping their heads with golden blossom crowns;
the sugar snap pea playfully winding its fingers along the trellis;
the squash leaves bursting from their hills as chloroplastic fireworks.

The rain is overwhelming. Spring cried her eyes out in the end, 
inches of water standing in the yard, in the garden, around the manure pile.
A mysterious well has replaced the asparagus. 
Dog racing through puddles, regarded by tomato plants as fountain statuary,
long streamers of water thrown behind his romping feet. 

Merry Summer Solstice, the heat of Day, the Sun, Life-bearer to Earth--much welcome.
Such joy in the green moss dancing under willow branches whispering
a home-coming spelled in fireflies, sung in frog-song,
repeated in the memories of lichen layers along the rotten apricot stump.

Now we come full circle, back to the starting point;
where we can now see the shadows of what has come before,
where we can now trace the shape of things familiar,
we balance the longest night in one hand and the longest day in the other.
Rejoice in the beauty of every

"event","Chicago neighborhoods, crowded blocks with apartments, old wood and bricks. Meteors striking the earth, leaving hazy and overcast dread, the smell of smoke and dust. Packing and searching begins. Searching for necessary tools, vehicle, and my people, so many things thrown in sacks and piled in the living room. Found my sister with msynthropes and ruffians, surly and tripping on acid. I manage to get her and Willie Nelson back with the others. I am trying to coordinate, delegate, and be efficient. I search for my station wagon, manuver it in place, the streets are empty and cluttered, the buildings full of people huddling against the end. The dread of the next big impact looming, palpable. I expect to fight to protect my cargo--the abandoned streets scream for calamity. I assign loading positions, and start to feel like we're are making progress to getting underground well-prepared. That is when someone tells me that they had put acid in the water, and it's only a matter of time till I lose the ability to function. In this escalating apocalypse, my hopes unravel and my skin crawls as I grip every failed senario. 
I wake up, feeling helpless and short on time. The winds howl with Spring and snow."

"event","In my dream I was traveling in Columbia with you and my mom. You were pleasant, gentile, and finally speaking to me. I was so relieved to have a normal conversation with you that I didn't even panic when I realized we had stumbled onto some plot by the local government involving the local water supply, and that the wrong people had found out that we knew. I was shoving things into a bag, trying to get your nose out of a book before the hit squad came to silence us. Some little girl warned us, and I only had to shoot two people with their own guns before we escaped. 
My mom was more savvy than I expected, but she was always like that, and somehow or another I lost my tevva's.

"event","I spent three amazing weeks in Korea, and came home to a busy work schedule, food poisoning, and 14hrs of time difference to adjust to. not only did i have amazing chance to explore Korea as a country and cultural experience, but i also was able to grow closer to B and share some wonderful moments with him.

from long years of being with partners who readily give lip-service but hold arms-length otherwise (the kind who make the end of a relationship a unilateral decision that they will send you a memo about later), i have really developed issue with validation and the apparently-inherent insecurity of relationships. when i have any sort of inkling that something is not on the level or less than perfect, it is quite literally a fight against a knee-jerk reaction to keep in perspective and not 'fall down the rabbit hole' of assumptions. it is even worse when my partner has the same insecurities, mine being not uncommon at all, and we exacerbate the situation beyond recognition. i lose perspective and can't enjoy what i have in the moment for fear of what i might lose in the future. i have grown to value one thing above all others; honesty. the honest truth, no matter how far it is from what i think i want to hear, is still infinitely better and causes much less pain than false niceties. the truly difficult struggle in my love of honesty is discovering how to correctly encourage it with one's reactions even if the information you are receiving is painful. and even more so, if i do feel that honesty is the best policy, shouldn't my most honest response be embracing its revelation? and being present, and accepting change is mediation practice. but, when a fellow you have been in love with for years finally tells you that he doesn't think he will ever feel the same about you, smiling may not readily be an option. and that's ok. but accompanying that initial sting is relief, and an understanding of how hard it is for somethings to be said; because, you care so much about the other person that it is not about rationalization, platitudes, or saving face. 

so what do i have? i have a man who cares about me as much as he can. who cares enough to tell me the whole story when i ask, when it would be easier not to. who has been a close-friend for almost ten years. someone who never asked for my love, but who has never pushed me away. someone i genuinely feel comfortable around, and who i fundamentally feel deserves to have unconditional love. someone who has shown numerous times that he is willing to travel across the country or planet to see me. someone i've had countless adventures with: http://greysniperpoet.livejournal.com/2006/10/15/; http://greysniperpoet.livejournal.com/2008/02/27/; http://greysniperpoet.livejournal.com/2008/06/09/; http://greysniperpoet.livejournal.com/2011/01/11/. someone who wants me to come to Korea and spend three weeks with him. someone who's open to what might be. someone who values who i am. someone who is a good person to the core, even if he doesn't see it. what i'm attracted to in people is simple but hard to find: brains, wit/humor, and a strong moral compass; i've never met anyone who matches B in maximizing those qualities, and he's become the standard by which i measure everyone else to some degree. 

all that i really lost was expectation, which is more of a blessing. not being concerned with how things will end up lets me refocus on what is right in front of me. that's what i need, and what B's always been good about; not letting me get sucked into my own neurosis too far, and i've always valued that. we had this talk early in my trip, so i was able to cry a little, thank him for his honesty, and fully enjoy the rest of my vacation. and B feeling like he didn't need to worry about leading me on, allowed him to be more affectionate and in-the-moment as well. he even took me out for a romantic date one evening, which was very sweet. he is a spectacular person and i'm happy to be in his life however he wants me. and when i am with him, it is enough. he treats me wonderfully, and i want for nothing with him. if i can keep myself from feeling inadequate for not being able to be his absolute 'everything', then i am very happy with what we have together. it might not be a conventional relationship, but it is a relationship of some sort that has been developing and growing over the last five years. probably the closest thing to a happy ending i will ever have. a part of me knows that i won't be able to trust anyone new again enough to fall in love. i think that chapter of my life is closed. i am ok with that. i have wonderful friends who have had their heart broken a dozen or more times before they found their 'one', but after three solid knock, i'm done. i just can't go through that heartbreak again. and i'm ok with that. i have a career starting, which i have to devote myself to; i have wonderful friends and family who make my life very complete; and i like who i am."

"event","I am in a state of transition and flux. 
But that doesn't really mean anything when you think about all the matter of existence moving through time; everything constantly changing, every reality a single result of infinite possibilities. 
That doesn't even really mean anything in the context of my own life. I feel that I should say that I am in more transition than I have been in the past? But that doesn't feel right either. Looking along my own timeline, I see events and adjustments that have slowly defined me, so many changes. I moved every four years growing up, and that frequency has only increased over the last several years. I drew the Fool, indicating new paths and a warning for caution, every time I touched the tarot all through law school. I've passed through foreign lands, bunted my broken heart from one lover to the next, wrestled gauntlets of loss and pain. I have experienced my hair short and long, I have worn many faces, and I have seen more of the world than most.

I don't know why I feel like now is special, or different, or more variable than any other time in my life--but that is exactly how it feels. 

I wear the mantle of my profession, my lawyering wizard cowl; that is probably the largest new variable. Being on this new playing field as a fully-fledged 'adult' makes every try a little more poignant, exhilarating, independently me. I've cast my die, and have been sorted. 

The weather and the wheel of the year anchor me. Each moment is unique, as is my experience in it. It has finally become properly cold by Chicago-standards. Imbolc nears. My thirty-first year approaches. My new year includes ventures; somewhere between cleric and mercenary. This city becomes more familiar as I continue to find my place in its workings. I feel more connected to some aspects, but overall, there is a deepening sense of isolation. but maybe that is what i have been seeking--solitude in the city. A way to feel alone even though I am surrounded by thousands and thousands of people. That was the sense of peace I had back in Kansas, the relief of being alone, and away from the mass of humanity. Any yearnings I have for companionship do not last, any inkling I develop falls flat; I am content with my felines and occasional gathering with friends. 

Yesterday was cold and dry, any exposed water has been frozen for days. I saw a pigeons, drinking water that had flowed into a crevice of the sidewalk from a potted plant, their heads pressed against the ground so that their short beaks could reach the liquid. I walked a few steps on before I decided; I turned around and poured half my water bottle on the sidewalk, and the half dozen seemed to appreciate the gesture by readily drinking. Are we all like that? A bare survival, wishing, without hope, for kindness and generosity to grant us a chance; allow us to make the movements we feel we could if we only had help managing that first step.

I am trying to change things, however I can. I am trying to leave a legacy of good acts; I have chosen career over children. I feel like I have leapt into a great void, friends and family tethering my free fall into something slightly more aerobatics. I just hope this pays off--that I am able to accomplish what I believe I am meant to, and maintain a personal happiness inside myself. For once, it feels like I am not waiting for my life to start, the day-to-day is now what I had been striving for. Everything feels so different this year. I am hoping that it is a good thing."

"event","It has been forever since i posted. i've been getting my firm up and running, which hasn't left time for much else. i was working through most of the end of the year on contract work, transitioning my business entity in the evenings and weekends from LLP to LLC. paperwork abounds, but in a series of timed explosions.

spent nearly three weeks away from Chicago over the holidays. first time i'd been out of the city since Aug. what a relief. driving to Kansas, listening to music, skype chatting with Brendan, rolling into a place that felt normal and organic. Chicago is a city where the buildings are so close to the streets and sidewalks that you can literally smell the insides of the buildings as you pass. people crammed into every space; full of life and adventure. lifetimes could be spent exploring all the corners. a modern version of what i always imagined when our d&d characters came to a bustling, trade city. out of the city, the openness of the sky, the lack of people, the sheer space was such a contrast. i felt like i had laid a weight down by leaving the city, i felt a sense of belonging that i had not realized i had been missing. i drove into the sunset as i cut through Hannibal, MO on my way to I-35. The sun was a cherry red, the first time i had seen a sky full of stars since Aug, proudly accompanied by a brilliant, silver crescent.

i visited with a few friends, went to dad's storage unit to fetch an electric blanket he'd been wanting, and drove out to friends' farm before the winter storm warning started. After my mom died, dad packed up all the furniture, bought an rv, and hit the road with Mongo, our family dog. Opening that storage room smelled so familiar, my grandmother's cedar chest filled with richly-scented blankets, the wood of the twin beds, bookshelves, and entertainment cabinet that my dad had made. as my sister and i grew up, i was usually the woodshop assistant, to help with setting long clamps, holding tape measures, bracing boards while they were being hammered into place, and walking plywood, in a straight and even path, into the table saw. i watched my dad create these pieces and then experienced them as a part of our lives growing up. it was the smell of home, and i missed my mother.
my friends' farm outside of Lawrence has also become a home over the last few years. it's a place i can go to get my hands dirty with earth, and put energy into something physical. armed with spade, shovel, and rake, i spent some time hacking, pulling, lifting, and pushing one part of a humongous compost pile onto another portion, grateful that i did not come face-to-face with snakes that might have been upset at my disruptions. happy to move and jump and grunt outdoors as the winter winds began blowing on my back, breathing in time to my movement as i celebrated life and earth and my embodiment of both. sweated in the sauna after darkness had come, listened to the wind howl, and dunked my head in cold water--icy tendrils pulling gasps from me, steam rising from my heated flesh. the smell of dried grass and promised snow. stars. and in the morning, there was white everywhere, dry and powdery, with the wind whipping it into drifts. we kneeled in the snow and tucked new blanket corners under limestone rocks to protect the row-covers from the dropping temperature, the wind playing havoc at every opportunity. it was wonderful.

i celebrated Yule, as is custom; gathering with my pagan family, giving thanks for the time we have together and all the blessings in our life, staying up all night, feasting, untangling a giant ball of yarn, hugs, and singing up the sun at dawn. as is custom, i call my dad after dawn, so that he can thank us for bring up the sun, and i can assure him that it will arrive on schedule in his time zone. then, giggling and exhausted, there is a breakfast, one last gathering before the holiday is concluded, and the rest of the world starts again.

it was great to visit with friends, some of whom i have known since high school. i never get to see everyone for every visit, but i spent a couple extra days in KS this time to catch up with some extra people. and with people you stay in regular contact with through the magic of technology, it's so warming just to share the same space and share absolute ""real""-time. had a chance to join my bff's family tradition of the making of the tamales, which was tons of fun. and my interest in the process was well-rewarded with all the secret recipes! That's right, i now possess the knowledge to make authentic, Mexican tamales! *yum* and aside from the rocking bonus of getting to spend time with Crystal, her family has gotten used to me, and they are a blast to hangout with.

after some extra hangout time with C, i flew to Denver, CO. i arrived late in the evening, and proceeded by bus to Ft. Collins, where i was picked up by cousins and delivered to Loveland, CO, where Aunt Clara and Uncle Monty have established their elder hall. what followed were several jam-packed days of extreme, family fun-time. there were a dozen cousins in from other parts for Christmas (several from Texas, Hong Kong, and KS). my dad, their 'Uncle Ben' (technically 'Great Uncle Ben'), and my sis from Tucson, other first and second generation cousins in the area, and my aunt and uncle made for quite the Norman Rockwell moments. it was delightful! i did get peopled out by Christmas day, but i had such an amazing time. it was such a closeness; family is so special. i felt so moved when i looked around a room of about thirty people could see the history and kinship that exists. how inherently similar we all are, yet each unique and distinct. i feel so proud that all of my cousins are doing things that they are passionate about. My family, both immediate and entire, are so important to me, and i love any time that we get to spend together. this was the first time that some had been able to visit in 5 years. We are all such a part of each other, and warmth of togetherness for the Holidays was palpable. *ahh, warm and fuzzy*

oh, and there was lazer tag, which was excellent! second round was boys vs girls, and the ladies won! ;) my ladies so smart! Trina was a little hellion, no surprise. ;) vicious as a fox! we went to a really cool micro brew, and Uncle Monty brought us home growlers for dinner the next couple nights. we did a little hiking, which was so much fun. it was great to hear stories and share stories, and there were some great group hugs. 

after all of this, i jumped into my dad's truck with Trina, and the three of us headed down to Tucson. we passed the semi-truck carrying the K-state football team's uniforms for the bowl they played, and that made Dad's day. Dad could tell he was getting sick on the ride down. then Trina came down with a nasty cold. both had fevers, and dad wasn't getting better, even after they put him on antibiotics. they were pretty sick the entire time i was visiting, which was a shame. i had one day where i needed to take a nap and had a short fever, but i didn't toss it or anything. we still had some good hangout times, and managed to go see the Hobbit. We listened to some recordings of grandma telling about her life (amazing woman!), and Trina found some old tapes that she and i had made when we were little (spectacular as well as poignant), and this was the first year that it was ok to actually talk about mom and have it not be too painful. i made my dad watch The Royal Tenenbaums, and he thought it was weird but enjoyed it. i was able to do a little hiking, but not much.

i left Tucson new year's morning, and that afternoon, Dad went to the hospital because he wasn't feeling any better and we were getting worried, i suppose his stubbornness finally wore out. it was really hard to not be there, but i would have just fussed over him until he yelled at me. he spent two days there before they finally found something that worked, and he is much recovered now. Trina kept me updated, and i made my way back to KS. it was great to come (second-)home to Crystal after all that adventuring, and decompress with her for an evening. originally, i would have driven home, but instead i lent Black Mamba, my truck, to my cousin for the next 5mos or so (fighting oil pipeline in TX). the next evening, i boarded an overnight bus, and headed for Chicago. got in at 6am, David was kind enough to pick me up. i dropped my things off at home, said hello to the kitties, changed into lawyering clothes, and headed downtown. so ensued a law-firm extravaganza that i have had little respite from. i will blog about those adventures on my semi-professional blog. 

well, it's almost my birthday. soon i will be 31: strange to think about. i am in a much better place this year as compared to last, for which i am very grateful. but after all that people-time for three-weeks straight, followed by crazy-busy-ness; i'm pretty drained and need to recharge. i feel that i'm getting to where i need to be and i am loving the journey, but it is difficult and soul-consuming more often than not. i just hope i can keep up the pace and generate business that will sustain me so that i can keep giving back to the community. when i am stressed out, i have violent, epic dreams; with battles and monsters and armaments. i feel like i have so much responsibility in my waking and sleeping; i have been having a hard time finding my quiet space. i worry about failure and about letting down my family. i worry that what i am doing is not enough to generate positive change. i have a list three million miles long and it grows faster than i can finish tasks. but this is what they programmed me for in law school; to triage, to sustain under pressure, to dig deep and plow through till things are better. i read Ender's Game in Tucson; at least i don't have it that bad. my next big mile-marker is my trip to S.Korea at the end of Feb. it will be three-weeks with the wonderful Brendan."

there is so much to do and i can't seem to get in front of it. sure, i know that this is will probably be the toughest point of setting up my firm: this working two-jobs, build your presence, network, organize administratively-thing. and while my to-do list is a million miles long, i have made significant progress in the last two months. the tough thing is the instability of this temp work. i was on a project for nearly 6 months, which finished in the beginning of june, since then it has been short and inconsistent work. death by a thousand cuts. 
luckily, everyone is very encouraging, and when i feel like this and throw up my hands: i feel the warmth and love of people in my life and can't help but be steadied. 
i've gone all-in on this bet, and i'm holding out for the payout. i still think i can do it, but i know how much more has to happen first before is suppose to click. i'm taking all the right steps, i just need to believe in myself and keep walking. i'm doing this for myself, but i'm also doing this for my mom and dad; for my sister; for my friends; for the people i want to help receive health care services, access to diagnostic testing; and for the benefit i can make on the world around me. that will be my legacy. ugh, when am i going to catch a break? :)

what else?

:::: break a couple weeks ::::

I am better. I've stopped grinding my teeth. I've made some headway with networking and getting my name out there, and that feels good. Blogging has slowed down, but that is because I have found a decent project, and I've had a lot of meetings this month; so that's a good thing. It's nice to be a little more stable financially after the rocky summer. I have even had some nibbles on lab jobs.

The place I am working now seems like a good setup. They made sure I had access to the bike room and shower facility (which even has a steam room), and the supervisors treat us well. I have been receiving my weekly veggie delivery (local organic seasonal, delivered to my door for ~$14/week), which has made for some yummy cooking. 

There are a lot of events coming up: mountain goats concert, one-shot game with some friends I've made over the last year, and my 6th annual V for Vendetta party with my bff coming in for that weekend. I feel like I am starting to make some good friends I'm Chicago, which is great. I saw the cat circus a couple of weeks ago, and went to the black cat ball last week. 

With all my firm work and full time job, squeezing in a few social events is about all I have been able to manage. I've been a hermit in the romance department. There is a guy I met early in the summer, who is incredibly sweet and I enjoy his company. He basically comes over during the weekend, and we hangout, cook, go out, and he'll usually spends the night on my air mattress. We don't kiss or even hold hands, but we'll snuggle during a movie. It's a strange place, but it is pleasant. He satisfies the domestic, companionship needs I have without pressuring me for more. I still feel like my heart is too broken to be moved. I haven't been attracted to the idea of a lover, and haven't found anyone who I really want that way in a long time (well getting close to a year, which is long for me). Buddhist nun seems like a better outcome at this point.

:::break a week:::

Went to the Mountain Goat's concert last night, and they were amazing as always. I love John Darnielle, he is an amazing and inspiring person."

"event","""Damn These Vampires"" --The Mountain Goats
Brave young cowboys of the near north side
Mount those bridge rails
Ride all night
Scream when captured
Arch your back
Let this whole town hear your knuckles crack

Sapphire Trans-Am
High beams in vain
Drive wild broncos
Down the plain
Push up to the corner
Where the turbines hiss
Some day we won't remember this

Crawl til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me

Tie those horses
To the post outside
And let those glass doors open wide
And in their surface
See two young savage things
Barely worth remembering

Feast like pagans
Never get enough
Sleep like dead men
Wake up like dead men
And when the sun comes try not to hate the light
Some day we'll try to walk upright

Crawl til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these bite marks
Deep in my arteries
Crawl til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me


The long-time, horror element of being vampirized is that it takes you past an invisible line, which forever renders you damned. You have been changed from what you were, a mortal who could and can redeem themselves, into a creature that is removed from that lineage. It doesn't matter if you were a good person before, it doesn't matter if you did not consent to being changed; there are no extinuating circumstances and no knights to ride in and save you. This is similar to the legal concept of Strict Liability. (In criminal law, for instance, there is always a mens rea component to a crime; aka, your mental culpitude. It makes the difference between a crime of passion and cold, calculated first-degree murder. With somethings, it does not matter if you were aware of something, if the condition is met, you are guilty/liable. Manufacturers and sellers of products are strictly liable for the performance and safety of their products to a degree. It doesn't matter if every step was perfect and employee acting appropriately, if someone gets hurt from your produt--they are liable.)
Is this how my heart and soul work?
I think that part of the reason I was unable to break away from my first relationship (all 7.5yrs of it!), was because I had lost my virginity to him and hated the thought of losing that picture perfect story of staying with your high school sweetheart. There was a purity aspect to it, that now, looking back, seems ridiculous. I blame our society's puritan morals and princess movies. seriously, those movies are completely unrealistic. Ala Keat's Ode to a Grecian Urn, if the lovers could catch each other in their chase around their urn, the relationship would become pain and disappointment. It is that moment of rapturous puppy love which is only truely pure if crystalized and immortalized. Fast forward past the Happily Ever After a few years, and let's see where things are! In Buddhist practices, it is essential to accept the impermanence, and therefore the precious aspect of every moment. Change is life and life is change. Accepting the inherent beauty of change allows us to quiet the mind, set down our burdens, and become the Buddha. So in some ways, embracing something fully is a good thing. But then when the change comes, are you ready? 
I feel like working on this last breakup (which is now officially longer than the actual relationship was), has been a blessing and a boon. I am generally pretty happy with myself, where I am, who I am, how I operate; but I lose part of myself when it comes to romance, and I become an ugly, co dependent thing.  Decided that I am tired of this shortcoming and that I would really put in some good 'me' time to hone in on my insecurities, and really shine some light on them until they are gone or I know how to control them. I did a few months of cognative behavioural therapy, and I felt like it gave me some good tools to try for a while before I go back for more. I also recently discovered neurological language programming, which is perfect for me. I visualize and spatially-orient very well, so visualizing problems, and tying emotions to conditioned responses is a promising resource to add to my toolbox.  
I continue to feel as though I have been shoved past some point, and I can never go back. every relationship is full of positive experiences that i am grateful for, but each one exacts a toll that is more and more severe. i was over my first relationship (7.5 yrs) after about a month, getting over my lawschool boyfriend (1.5yrs) took four or five months, but this last one feels like it is never going to go away. how many times can a heart recover from such a break?
i don't want another real relationship until i've 'fixed' somethings with myself, and until i stop thinking of HIM as the lost love i want back. i mean, i'm glad we broke up, even if it wasn't on my terms. we had both become exactly what we said we didn't want to be: co-dependent, which is not a pretty thing. but even though i'm happier and more satisfied without that relationship, i'm still in love with him, and he is still the person i wish would walk through the fucking door sometimes. i'll never find someone as amazing and special as him, and that eats me up inside. i hope that if i work hard to better myself, maybe someday we can actually be friends and i can have him in my life again, but in a healthy way. i still see him as some perfect demi-god. i don't even really know him, but i would like the chance. not now, but maybe months or a year from now. maybe then i'll be ready--ready to see who he is and still accept him. to be that long-term friend that he wants to cultivate. how's that for the pollyanna perspective?

but none of that will mend the cracks in me. 
i walk amongst the spoilt, 
i eat the foods of corpses.
goddamn you, for what you've done to me."

"event","it was a delightfully rainy day today in Chicago. the kind of day we should have gotten in the late Spring season. instead we hadit became a day of cooking. for the first time in a very, VERY long time, i purchased beef from the grocery store! i procured 2lbs of 97% ground beef for a meatloaf. 

my meatloaf: beef, onion, garlic, oatmeal, egg, tomato paste and ketchup,and seasonings. 
<img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/558900_816079169309_287552656_n.jpg"" />

i also made a large batch of beans and rice, so even after a hearty dinner with a friend, and sending them home with at least 3 meals worth of left overs, i still have at least two, probably three, meals left. oy! 
there is a flash flood warning until 1am. for all its coolness, Chicago often has drainage problems in the residential areas. this may contribute to something else i have seen in the streets of Chicago: SINKHOLES!!! I was biking to my friend Nick's place (i may have mentioned my bar study buddy from last year), and there was a private (not city) vehicle sitting in the middle of the street (I believe it was off Damen around the Roscoe Village area) with its blinkers on. just behind it, the asphalt was starting to cave in, and there was a hole approximately large enough to fit a dining room chair through. When I was biking home (post BBQ) a couple hours later, the hole had doubled in size, and there were cones and police vehicles surrounding it. I did not have my camera, or I would have taken a picture. apparently it was not large enough to make the news, because i have not seen reports of it.

now being from Kansas, i've always thought of sinkholes as some sort of scary, unpredictable phenomenon that will swallow you into the bowels of the earth! fast-running underground streams, eating their way through salt layers in the bedrock. who knows when or where it will happen? it has never seemed like a 'man-made' thing there, and the only ones i could think of were always out in the middle of no-where. but as seen above, sinkholes are an urban monster as well!

http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Bulletins/214/08_app.html#APPD

but they have a mysterious and eerie quality to them. i liked the sinkhole in Garden State, particularly. possibly inspired by the ones in Guatemala (and Venezuela):
<img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://kidsblogs.nationalgeographic.com/kidsnews/assets/news_images/sinkholes-holes-ground-2010-guatemala-city-lg.jpg"" />
they also inspired the book Into the Lost World, when they were discovered in the 1970s.
<img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://static.environmentalgraffiti.com/sites/default/files/images/http-inlinethumb49.webshots.com-43248-2921426120102347975S600x600Q85.jpg"" />
and as a geneticist, I think that bottleneck/founder populations are fascinating!

the causes of sinkholes are known: they occur from dissolved salt and/or sand layers in earth, which create spaces that inevitably cave inward. certainly a frightening prospect! with Chicago's cold winters, small water main breaks are likely, and that breeds sinkholes.

anyway, in other news: in the last month i've had my dear friend Brendan visit me from S. Korea (he's been teaching English there for the last year, and is going for a second), and i went camping in Kansas (wonderful Gaea with wonderful friends). I have my first paying client, and the website is up (albeit still under construction).
i have started growing my hair out. it will be a gift for my dad, since he's always liked it long. it is still very short, but beginning to get shaggy. it is going to drive me crazy."

"event","I was having someone over for dinner for the first time this weekend. And, as when someone new comes over, it is interesting to see how they are around the kitchen. This is determined by what they do while I prepare a meal, how comfortable they are conversing, and whether they have a similar notion as to the spacial orientation of my kitchen utilities and utensiles. For some reason, I get really excited about this stuff, and it is not even related to the primary purpose of this rant. It helps to set the stage; in that, this person enjoyed my organization methods and I started thinking that I should do a little set of posts about how I organize my life. I really enjoy discovering how other people's brains work, specifically how they perceive and process things differently from me. Maybe this will be a good opportunity to start dialogue. :)
I must admit, that it is awfully quiet on lj from my perspective. At least, most of the friends I follow have shifted their regular, digital expression to fb. Not that there is anything wrong with that; I really appreciate the connectedness that fb allows between people. And while it is not as abreived as Twit (I will never sucumb to that idiocracy!), it is still a place for daily, adventure updates and insights, and not long prose or narrative forms where a person can really take the time to lay out a segment. Buffalowmn, for example, has a delightful tone and canter to her writing style. She is clever yet succinct, and always engaging. I miss her regular lj posts diving into the books she`d been reading or her little daily rituals. Posts that were not only an in-depth examination of life, but also with the care and benefits of reflection. Sometimes a good lj post is cathartic for the author, letting them make connections and admit weaknesses--an unburdening, and opening of doors to the sunlight. Sharing that experience is part of the human condition. It is amazing that such things are possible so readily in our time.
This summer I told myself that I was going to be more regular on lj again. I've been on here for a very, long time, and I think that it still has a place in my life. I really dropped off in law school, but hey, give me a break! ;) anyway, that's where I am with that."

"event","i realize now that throughout my childhood and into my adult(still don't feel right using that word) life, weather, particularly storms, have influenced my perception of nature and the impermanence of existence. in California (4-8yo) we lived in the mountains outside of Lake Tahoe, the winter snowfall was deep and plentiful every year. one summer, it snowed in July. with drops of perhaps 3'-4' several times a winter; learning to play in the snow was a 'must know' for any kid. whomever invented those water-proof snowpants deserves an award. my sister and i would pile, scoop, throw, pack, dig, construct, and flop-upon snow with great abandon. in the delicate springs, i discovered i was allergic to dogwood trees when i kept trying to climb them (being the only climbable, non-great pine in the yard).

in Tennessee (8-12yo), we had the all sorts of weather. one winter was marked with a ferocious ice storm that took out power for days, and covered the world in several inches of ice. we couldn't reach my best friend on the phone, so my dad and i got into his truck and drove over there. they lived outside of town, in a heavily wooded region, and there were ice-covered branches all over the road from the soft-wood trees of the South--unaccustomed to the weight of any ice, much less 2""-3"". i remember my hands burning from pulling branch after branch from the path of my dad's truck. we eventually had to go home for the chainsaw and discovered that they had gone to town and stayed with her grandma for the night. her family came to stay with ours because we had a propane heater. our neighbors came as well, i think we had a dozen people in our living room for a couple of nights until the power came back on. 
TN was also the placed we lived when my family was hit by a tornado. that is a rather long story, but the houses surrounding ours were mostly destroyed and we had no power or water for two-weeks. the red cross fed us, and 'rubberneckers' drove through our neighborhood to gawk at the devastation. everyone was safe, though. 

Oklahoma (12-16yo) is also called Tornado Alley. spring storm season, green skies, and swirling purple clouds were an expected transitional catalysis from winter to summer. the King of All Weather: Gary England (total legend: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_England ) protected you with his benevolence and grace. and where we lived out in the countryside (land abutting cow and horse pasture, 5 miles from town), we could look out over the lands as the weather swept through; magnificent! my love affair with the wind began there.   

Japan (24-25yo) is a very seasonal nation. i delighted in the school principal when he would share with me that such-and-such flower had blooomed, which meant that fall was arriving. <img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5744/2488/1600/Picture%20007.0.jpg"" /> i also had to leave the country one day early because there was a typhoon coming in, and they were worried i would be stranded. and also the Earthquakes! it feels like a part of your fundamental confidence in reality is shaken when the Earth herself becomes unstable beneath you. 

Kansas (16-26yo, -1 for jpn). words will never be able to describe the majesty and wonder that is Weather and the Sky in Kansas. it is transcendent, and your heart will find it's home there. truely, the land of Ahhh's. :) <img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://lh6.ggpht.com/-VAEULV9EXrI/T4BVV-luhEI/AAAAAAAAHDQ/330UtHqd2eI/Photo0244.png"" />

throughout most of this (not japan or after moving out of my parents') there was the WEATHER ALERT SYSTEM. it is a box with a speaker, three buttons, a volume knob, and an antenna. you turn it on and it is set to the national weather services's emergency alert radio station. you can set it for alarm, and it will wail at you and then tell you the weather watches and warnings for your area in a computer voice. 
my dad brought me our old family one when he and trina came to visit. he's so worried about me living off by myself and he knows i don't watch tv (so would miss warnings). so now i have a wailing machine in my kitchen so that i can safely grab the cats and run down the stairs when a tornado comes crashing through Chicago. awww, i love my dad, and i am grateful that i have had so many unique and diverse experiences in my life. blessed be!"

"event","i'm working this weekend. considering i haven't worked during a weekend for over a month now, i consider it fair play. at first i was really excited about having two fridays for 4th of July week, but i was not counting on how much it would SUCK TO GO BACK TO WORK ON THURS AND FRI!!! :P oh well. i spent my fourth on the beach. i failed my 'reapply' roll for sunblock and ended up with a light burn on my shoulders and chest. but i did borrow my friend's giant umbrella, which was the why i only had a light burn from standing out in the water rather than full roastage from 4hrs of heat-of-the-day sunlight. 
growing up, my parents (especially my dad, who HATES it when his fair-skinned daughters get burned) would not even let us go swimming until it was past 3 in the afternoon. and we still had to wear sunblock. but since a majority of visible aging is caused by collagen break down via UVA, i'm pretty ok with my sun-caution at this point. and now that i'm 30, i like to thank every poor liquor store attendant or bar bouncer who cards me. 

chainsaw has been on a much stricter diet for the last month, and i think he's playing more and being a little more active. it's hard to tell if he's losing weight since i see him all the time. my dad thinks i should get some string and measure him around his middle, which is a good idea that i have not implemented. with independence day, there were of course an abnormal amount of fireworks. velcro noticed them and was entirely fascinated. and both cats, no surprise, are thrilled that i got a/c this year. i am entirely grateful for promising them last year, because the heat this year has been redonkulous. we had three days in a row with triple-digit temperatures. oy! the heat broke this afternoon, and the temp plummeted a good 25degrees into the low 80s. my new project is in a part of downtown that is difficult to get to via bike, and there are no shower facilities available. so i've been doing my p90x videos. tonight, i hopped on my bike and headed to my friend's for some grillin'. the weather was delicious!! between the lovely bike rides to and from, and the food, beer, and chattenins (yes, i made that word up)--i'm feeling quite content at the moment."

"event","i had a lovely weekend a while back and wanted to share!  
Friday: finished work, exercised, and played 5hrs (five hours) of magic cards with some great guys next door! my neighbor has a weekly game with friends that occasionally lands at his place. i haven't played in a large magic game for years and years, and these guys are super into their magic! they had accessories that made me look like a novice (like playing mats to put their cards out on, and one guy had DARTH VADER card protectors): i knew i was in good hands. i arrived around 730, around 1230 i was calling 'uncle' (to walk to my bed 20' away) and they were surprised i was leaving so early. :P maybe next time i will prepare for the shmorgishborg-orgy of magic that they are apparently used to. it was pretty great.

Saturday: got up pretty early and started cleaning. i made myself a light breakfast, and enjoyed my morning. R biked over and we went down the street to her friend's apt for a pre-dyke march brunch. apparently, before THE Gay Pride Parade! there is the Dyke March. i know, it sounds angry. militant even. counterpoint this to what i'd kept hearing about THE Parade being entirely to commercial. Sure, it should be as loud, flamboyant, and celebratory as possible. but there were complaints that 'pink-wash' was rampant in recent years. Anyway, R's friends were the most dressed up and diverse group of women; each embodying a different aspect of the queer spectrum (though certainly not all). and the gathering pre-march was delightfully familiar. 
   Having lived in a number of different small-ish towns, i have come to recognize a common energy to gay pride events. community-minded, visibility, first-Am speech flexing, a group-mentality of camaraderie, and plenty of pride. the Dyke March participants were not all butch females. there were all sorts of different people there to be together and support acceptance and tolerance through visibility. a group had pre-made signs for people that wanted to grab them: i swooped up a ""Bi-Pride"" sign, and was pleased as punch. the march went through the 'little Vietnam' area (~3blks south of my apt, and a favorite grocery destination), and generally around the neighborhood south of me: Uptown. it is a highly diverse and semi-rough area for the north-side of Chicago; the route was about a mile even. it was fun seeing all the people marching and spectating, signs, and dykes on bikes (hott!). at the end we were back in the park where we had gathered. there was free food and bands. i hung around for a little while, then headed off down the redline train. 
i've made a new friend who is a BIG gamer and we get along splendidly. i'm totally excited to yoink him into my burgeoning gaming group as a fellow shadowrun enthusiast. i met up with him, G, for some sushi dinner at Itto (http://www.ittosushi.com/), which was wonderfully authentic. everyone working there was japanese, and there were plenty of japanese patrons. the Agedashi Tofu (always my indicator of good japanese) was FABULOUS!! after running around outside for several hours, plenty of sushi and beer was the perfect way to recharge for the rest of the night. Next, G and i headed downtown to the Chicago theater. he originally bought two tickets, and when he started asking around, i was the only person who was excited about both the opener and headliner. opener: King Crimson Project (what's left of a progressive rock band from the 70s); headliner: Dream Theater (really talented heavy metal band). it was SO MUCH FUN! it has been quite some time since i've been in a headbanging situation. a couple of years ago i was able to do some moshing at the marilyn manson concert, but a while since my last headbanging fix. :) because the bands were basically from two different generations, it was really neat to see all the father-son combos there. plus, metal concerts are funny with all the black band t-shirts that everyone wears. i screamed my head off, threw the horns, bounced around ecstatically, and banged what little hair i have to the beat. afterwards, grabbed some beers and a late-night meal, and headed home. 

Sunday: THE Pride Parade was sunday. met up with G (he'd never been either), and took the train down to the area. it was just what you might expect: a jam-packed, parade atmosphere, with men in boys' shorts aplenty, and all the rainbows you could hope for. it took us nearly an hour to squeeze through two blocks of people and then cross the street to stand with some other friends that were there. during that adventure, with all the people there, i happened to run into my partner (of our firm), which was pretty awesome. i even stood in the direct sun for about two hours watching the parade once we were at our set viewing spot with my friends. it was good energy, and i'm really glad i went. the people and floats in the parade were mostly politicians, and local organizations and companies. i didn't feel like it was a horribly 'corporate' event, which was a relief. leaving, and getting away from all those people was also interesting: it felt like such a vacuum to suddenly be walking on a street with just a few pedestrians per block. there were late lunchin's, and then G and i looked at shadowrun character creation for a while back at my place.

this weekend followed the two weekends of my family visiting. and, as you can see, i did not have time to get much done. i've been playing catch up since, it feels like. everything was in order in time for my boardgame party (which was last weekend), where we played 4hrs of the Battlestar Galactica game among other things: and it was AWESOME!!! i think i make a ridiculously good Admiral. :)

i feel like my life is alternating between having all these great experiences, and these short low-points where i hug my plushy shark pillow and cry myself to sleep. does everyone feel this hopeless and desolate inside sometimes? i suppose it will get better, though i am not sure how. i feel like a whiner to complain because my life problems are pretty small comparatively, but they still hurt the shit out of me. yesterday for instance: i went to the beach with R and her german boyfriend who is visiting for two weeks. it was a great time, and R is so lovely and sweet. but then my evening plans took a raincheck and i crawled into bed and watched all the fireworks from my apt (the entire horizon was teeming with colored explosions), snuggling with someone's jacket they didn't want back and feeling thoroughly miserable for myself. he gave his secret blog name to someone else, and now he's using it for his semi-public love letters, which makes me feel just fantastic. argh, i should never have looked (pony already said i should avoid looking back like a plague of zombies with the plague), and a restless night of bad dreams was my punishment i suppose. 
add on top of that, a wonderful skype with my dear friend B (he's teaching english in Korea), who told me that he's planning on settling down in asia after he returns to the US to finish a writing program. i suppose our relationship is horribly complex in its utter simplicity. i have been in love with him for a very long time, even though he has never lead me on (in fact, being quite adamant that he would never be able to love me the way i would need him to). so i go from having a nice chat with him, to upset that he hasn't asked me to move with him to asia in the future, which makes complete sense. i don't know why i have to validate myself through a romantic relationship, but there is a part of me that really likes and wants intimate and permanent companionship. i want to have someone to come home to; someone in bed every night to curl against. why is it so hard to find someone? it seems like other people have little difficulty finding their special person(s), while my love life is some-sort of painful cycle which gets worse with every go around. i give up on love, i reject that it will ever be kind to me. it is no longer worth the pain it causes and the way it makes me feel in the end. love is dead for me. eh, this is what therapy is for, i suppose."

"event","this may be more than obvious given my previous posts, but i've been going through a break up. the guy, while amazing, suffers from a case of vaguery due to wanting to hurt me less. the result is that he's been reinforcing my hope of things, and then the conflict comes because we are in different places. and now he will graduate (which i will probably not even be invited to), and move far away. i thought that he would remain a person in my life. never mind the fact that he's seeing someone else now (so am i), my heart aches over the loss of his company. and i feel rejection over how he has successfully pushed me away over and over again without batting an eye from my perspective. can i really mean so little to him now?

ok, i promise to stop whining about this non-consequential things i put my stress into, and discuss real life! i have a partner for my firm!!! he's also a new attorney, in my field (but not my niche), and we get along splendidly. we've filed for our partnership with the state, picked out a logo (thanks, you-know-who!!), and ordered business cards. GEEEEE!! it's great to have someone to do this with; i've always worked best in a team-setting. 

additionally, the contract/temp attorney grunt work i have been doing for the last 5 months is wrapping up this week. i already have a new grunt job lined up, which is nice because i like the paychecks, but bad because i have no break between. 

my dad and sis came up to visit me last weekend. they are taking a long, long road trip to escape the Tucson heat for a while. they stopped in KS on their way up. this week they've been visiting family in Indiana and Michigan, to return to Chicago this coming weekend for some more time with me. then they'll go up to Minnesota, then Colo before heading home. last weekend was fun. the two big things we did: Andersonville street festival and Chicago blues festival. see, Chicago is a fantastic summer-city! there are free concerts practically every evening downtown, and with ~50 neighborhoods in the city, each with their own weekend festival, you can get overloaded with how much fun there is to be had! think Zabu at the Con in The Guild. ;)
Andersonville is the neighborhood next to mine (i'm on the lake, in Edgewater), and it is a delightfully LGBT neighborhood, with some of the best restaurants around. <3 ! my dad had quite a dose of homo-culture walking around Clark street: it was pretty awesome! i'm proud of how cool he is with a lot of things considering he's turning 74! and with three of us, we could indulge in ridiculously bad food and split it three ways! :) Blues fest was similar. we brought a blanket, plenty of water, and tried out some food-things while we listened to some pretty smokin' blues. the people watching, as always, was marvelous! ;)

in other news, lfd with my friends has been particularly rocking lately. we usually are missing a fourth, and have to put up with the AI, but lately we've had a full house. i usually make us play on advanced difficulty (practicing for the zombie apocalypse), so when i kick it down to normal, we are utter badasses! even though i'm starting to make friends here, i still don't have that core group of long-time friends here yet; you know, the one's where you don't have to put on any social niceties because they've known you forever and are comfy with you? i get that fix over LFD once or more a week, and it often makes all the difference. :) aww. feeling sentimental. *sniff*

on that note, time to workout (decided not to bike today) before sitting in front of a computer for 9 hrs. :P hope everyone has a great day and an even better weekend!"

"event","Hadn't i compromised every fucking step? did you or did you not have all the control and power from the beginning? where is the mother fucking respect that i deserve in these final extractions? have fun with your midget (proud of the fact she resembles a 12yo. really?!), jap-o-phile (i never understood those people), wanna-be--i'm sure you'll have plenty in common (when all she has is some shitty BA in JPN culture/lit ...real keeper)--before you self-implode all over her too. your breaking point is so fast, it makes my head spin. when i have finally processed things and am ready to build a friendship with you, you have already hit the panic button and ran away from the messes you've made, again. way to go. you apparently only believe in second chances when it comes to yourself. you will never find someone as clever and capable as me. someday in the future, when all you have is a loyal dog, i hope you look back on all this and feel regret, pure regret for what you did wrong and the friendship you missed out on. 

Pro Tip for guys: 
do NOT tell a girl that you love her only three-weeks into a relationship. 
do NOT subsequently respond to her hesitation by saying that she can trust her heart to you because you will not leave without trying everything possible first. 
do NOT bottle everything up when you realized that it is not what you want, and allow months of unsettling and challenging distance and blowups to erode her sense of confidence in the relationship. 
do NOT then independently decide to end the relationship without following through on promises made previously.
do NOT 'try to be friends' by making vague excuses about your instability, when what you should be saying is that she's not the person that you want.
do NOT decide independently that your pathetic attempts at friendship are a failure by simply not replying when she is under the impression that you are still on speaking terms.
do NOT use the previous reasoning as an excuse to hide that you feel guilty about the fact that you maybe-kinda-like someone else now.
DO feel horrible. Absolutely retched about what a fuck-up you are, and how unnecessarily painful you made this whole process. You go to sleep at night telling yourself that you are the Galahad, when in reality you are a coward, a dishonest coward. (discuss that in group therapy)
DO tattoo a warning label on your body so that future lovers can be warned to never let themselves anywhere near you emotionally. 

the funniest thing in all this is that i do not have your hangups. i am capable of accepting you, caring about you, and being your friend. i am fierce, tenacious, and good in a fight. yes, i am FUCKING PISSED right now with how you handled things, but that does not ultimately change the way i feel about you. swallow that cold pill; that i can see past your momentary shitty actions and still recognize your worth. this is the real high-ground, and it is that sort of acceptance which allows people to build lasting relationships; not the good-weather associations you always seem to stop at. good friendships and romances require both parties to be willing to fight to keep them, because that is the only way they will last; maybe someday you will actually stand-up for a relationship in your life and keep it instead of walking away like you always do. i'll be here when you're finally ready to be a friend, because i never walked away. 

you're welcome for the best blowjob you will ever have in your life."

"event","I have not had a substantive update in eons. it's hard to decide where to start. 
perhaps a short summary: took the bar last week of july last year, started dating an amazing guy; scraped by on odd jobs until i received my cert of Bar passage; i was sworn in Nov, decided over the Holidays to start my own practice, was released back to wild by amazing guy post-new year; been working a good-paying contract job since Jan, setting up my practice (now with partner!), and finally ready to exercise my 'single' status again. Travels over the last year: friends' wedding in Portland in Sept (i introduced them!), KS for half-marathon in Oct, KS and Tuscon for Yule/Christmas, annual pagan festival over memorial weekend. I've had friends come visit (thinking particularly of epic-ladies' weekend with Crystal, Katy, and Jen), and my Dad and Sis will be here next weekend. Showing and introducing people to the splendors of Chicago is a total blast. for example, next weekend is the Chicago Blues Festival: all weekend, and free. :D if nothing else, i feel like i have friends and family that are a blessing in every way. I am loved, supported, and cherished for being me. sure, we can all wish to be millionaires, but brass-tacks--i'm hard pressed to need more in my life now.
it's amazing to transition out of student-mode again. I have more to do than i can ever manage to get to, but deadlines i set are now my own, and I can bask in the full meaning of 'weekend' again. 
I am now an attorney. I have finally become a professionally-licensed person; thus making me an 'adult', i suppose. I do feel more 'grown up', but only in the sense that i feel control over my own person-hood in a way that i did not before. the time of waiting is over, my life has ripened, and my legacy will be built on the next three decades of work. i just hope that i can find the opportunity to make the changes i want. it will be sometime before i have the client base needed to practice full-time, but it will eventually happen. i am too determined for it to not become reality. 
Chainsaw and Velcro are good. They are horribly spoiled in our tiny studio; i even got them A/C this year (I'd rather not have it, but they were so miserable last year) and a cat stroller for trips to play in the park. my tiny apt is very cozy for me, and I renewed my lease for this next year. my neighborhood has lots to offer, and being so close to the lake and the lake-shore trail is immeasurably beneficial. the place i have been doing contract work has a gym with shower, so I have been biking to work half the week (which works out to ~50mi and saving ~$10 on public trans per week). biking in Chicago is similar to driving on a busy highway when the weather is agreeable. I've found that i relish the cold/wet days because i have the bike trail largely to myself. Lake Michigan is most spectacular! aside from the lack of salt in the air, you cannot tell that it is not the ocean (yes, double negative!); and the color of the lake is a different color practically every day. there is one part on the trail close to downtown where the waves will splash up very dramatically when it is windy in the right direction--i always whoop and holler when i bike through the water because it is so exhilarating.
i am still building a friend network. i miss the comfort of my friends back in KS and WA. i've been thrust into social situations with strangers so often that i am a practiced hat at it, but it is draining. being able to sit in a room full of people and feel completely at home is a rare thing to be cherished. i think that is why my annual memorial weekend in KS is so important to me. this year, i took a whole week off for it, and it was in every way spectacular! spent time with my bff, dinner with old friends, did some gardening out at Cedar Springs, ate steak with T (grilled on open fire!), soaked up as much peace and greenery as my soul could handle, tranced-out dancing to drums around a bonfire, drove black mamba (pickup) around the county roads, bbq'd with friends post-camping and laughed so hard that my stomach hurt, and managed not to get sunburnt! 
this past Nov 5th i had my 5th annual V for Vendetta party. i believe there were ~a dozen attendants. C came to town for it, and we cooked up quite the epic spread! chicago, being so large, is a city of mixing cultures. common knowledge is a plethora of holidays/celebrations/events that i have never heard of before. neighborhood festivals are also a 'to-do', and a person can go to one every weekend all summer and probably not get to all of them. like some sort of LARP, vampire power structure, the city is divided into local fiefdoms that correspond with the ~50 distinct neighborhoods. you can cross a street in chicago and be in a completely different neighborhood that is entirely distinguishable from the one you just left. tucked away eating establishments are a treasure to be discovered, and everyone has an opinion on where to go for the best-*insert food type*. 
additionally, it is interesting to see the differences in how people live in a big city versus smaller towns of which i am accustomed. people want to individualize themselves in the throngs of people, so you see more daring outfits. i've noticed that many people are apt to yell at you if they decide you are inconveniencing them. there is anonymity in a crowd, but there is also a commonality that i have seen rise to the occasion on crowded buses and trains where one person is rude. ultimately, i am consistently awed by just how many people are here! i can't go anywhere without thinking about all the other people who are here living their lives too. their distinct perspectives are so different from the person standing next to them. 
well, i will attempt to be more regular in my postings. perhaps next i will share about my bay-window garden! :)"

"event","ok, i'm going to get geeky for a sec: in Stargate SG-1, Samantha Carter is not only a brilliant astro-physicist, but is also a way kick ass lt. colonel in the Air Force and stunningly beautiful. :) Sam is always turning down alien men, fellow physicists, and gov't agents who hit on her. the one fellow that she would be interested in, Jack O'Neall (Richard Dean Anderson), is unavailable/impracticable because they are both in the military. There's a whole episode where Sam has a concussion and hallucinates a conversation with her dad who tells her to stop being afraid of love! (very dramatic) then Pete comes along, a very cute police officer, who seems to be perfect and very devoted and into her. they even get engaged, but a few weeks before the wedding, Sam realizes that it's not what she wants. eventually Jack falls out of the picture when he's promoted to general and stationed as an advisor to the president. 
every now and again, the teams has adventures involving alternate universes, and the writers ALWAYS love showing different Sams. Inevitably, the other Sams have always married one of the other male characters, and their universe is always way worse off. SO, what's the big picture here? Sam has an amazing career saving the universe on a regular basis, is brilliant, capable, dead sexy even in her BDUs (she has less than a handful of cleavage shots in the whole 10 seasons), and completely unattached. I love it. It's so very reinforcing and stands in contrast to so many other stories. 

Bar prep is awful, but it will be over soon. it is literally the biggest test i will ever take in my life. it's not that the test materials are difficult, but that you have to basically know EVERYTHING! specifically, i have over 30 different topics of law to know, some of them bigger than others. ugh. as of this week i'm finishing new material, and for the next >2weeks i will be shoving it all in my brain and taking practice essays. and as soon as that's over, i'll be finding a part time job while look for a real associate position and await my Bar results (Oct). I'm also going to start studying for the Patent Bar, which I can take whenever, and then I will be allowed to submit patent applications to the USPTO. because you can only take the patent bar if you have a science degree there are not a lot of attorneys who can't, so it is a good commodity to have!

I keep not finishing this post. A lot has been going on. My little sister's brain chemistry changed two tuesdays ago, and she called me scared, looking for help. something was definitely wrong, and she couldn't communicate, had to use strange vocabulary, the color yellow was making her cry--some really abnormal stuff. so she took my advice and went to the hospital: this all happened fourth of july. they released her last night, and she's going to need time and support to re-stabilize. the medication they gave her has helped with some of the communication stuff, but it basically looks like a combination of stress; her severe, long-term sleep deprivation from her night-shift job; and unprocessed grief from mom's death five and a half years ago. but she's excited to learn about and work on what's happened, and she's glad she went to the hospital. i'm very proud of her. 

so, at some ungodly hour tomorrow morning, my dad is going to get in his truck and drive from Tuscon, AZ to Baltimore, MD (should take about three days). He's going to give her a big hug, then load up her stuff in his truck, and hitch up her car. then he's taking Trina and her cat, Bowie, back to AZ. she can rest, stabilize, and relax; start seeing MH providers; and spend some proper time with dad. in a month or so, if she's feeling ready, dad will help her enroll in the local community college so she can take a few classes and keep working on her degree. he already has their exercise routine planned at the local gym so they both stay healthy. I love my Daddy sooooo much! he is amazing and my total hero. i can only hope to be half the parent he and my mom have been to us. 

so-yeah, things have been kinda stressful, and i've had to get all 'lawyerly' on the phone more than once with hospital staff. but once dad is there, i will be able to put all this stress down for a while and refocus on just my bar prep stress. ;)

Today, i took a full MBE test. AKA, i just practiced day 2 of the bar, which is 200 multiple choice questions in 6hrs, with an hour break in between. i did it in 4, and i scored within passing already, and i'm just now entering the stage where will start memorizing. so, good stuff. i also copied (at the bottom) one of my graded practice essays (somehow i imagine that Turtle will find bar testing essays interesting *wink*), this one is an enclosed essay where you get a 12-25 page 'case' packet of fake evidence and fake law. you are usually asked to write a brief or letter based on what's there, and you have 1.5hrs. on day 1 i will have one of these kinds of essays, and then nine, 30minute essays, three of which will be Ill specific. the smaller essays are where you dump your lawyer-talk and factual analysis. should be fun!

I have two weeks left: plenty of time to memorize THE LAW if your a WIZARD, like i am!! (i don't know if i mentioned this before, but when i graduated law school, they put a sweet wizard hood on me--no joke! there are pics on my blogspot /link at top/)

I took last weekend off and went to KC for a long-planned trip w/ C's fam down to Roaring River Missouri State Park! it was a pretty nice time! it's an underground-spring fed river, so it's very cold and clear. they stock it with trout, and you can play in the river too. there were ~40 family members there, and they are a big, fun Mexican family! C's family has a core group of aunts and uncles in the center of everything, and so it reminded me of my family get-together's. Hmm, i'm going to start planning the next one for my family soon if someone doesn't beat me to it! I got proper sun, but not burnt. and no bug bites or poison ivy! i ate way too much yummy food, and probably only studied a couple hours a day tops. :) drank plenty of water and cheap beer. and, of course, always good to hang with crystal! 

my tomato plant is huge, but it keeps dropping it's blossoms! i'm going to try some more 'tough love' on it and not water it quite so much, see if that helps. my basil and cilantro are yummy-yummy, and i grab them to go with dinner pretty often. been enjoying my p90x workouts again: talk about nice and sore the next day! anyway, hope ya'll are good if i haven't seen you or spoke with you recently. i look forward to being a normal, social, and productive member of society in the VERY near future!! whoot! 

MPT Essay (""**"" = the comments from the person who graded it): 

(copied from handwriting)

Date and Heading

Dear Mr. Henry Bowman,

Thank you for your letter expressing your client's concerns over the upcoming annexation of Acadia Estates. However, your legal position does not give TWS any current rights in providing water to the area. To be territorally protected under 7 USC 1926(b), your client must be 1) a qualified association, 2) have a loan from the federal govenrnment for the area, and 3) have provided or have available services to that area. FWS v. Orangevale. While TWS is an 'associattion' in that it is a non-profit retail water supply corporation, section 1926(a), and it does have approximately $1.4 mil in loans due to the Federal government; the loans are only for El Dorado Co. and TWS does not satisfy the service requirement. **This is a good beginning paragraph stating your reasoning for denial.**

to satisfy 'service' under the Act, TWS must have a 1) legal right to provide water to the area, and 2) physical ability to provide water to the area prior to service by the City. Klein WC v. Stewart. TWS only has a CCN for El Dorado Co, and not Bluewater Co, where Acadia Estates will be located. TWS only applied for their expansion a few days ago, and will not have adequate sevice pipes built for more than 2 years. state law requires that continuous and adequate service be proven by TWS before an expansion CCN will be issued. Franklin Code section 450 and 457. So no legal rights currently exist.

TWS also do not satisfy the physical ability requirement The Court of Appeals has looked at similar cases and found that existing water lines more than a mile from the area is too far to be considered physical ability. Klein WC v. Stewart. Your client's lines are more than three miles away. Also, Acadia Estates will require a main water line of at least 12'', whereas the TWS line along highway 45 is only 6"" and already servicing 100 homes. 

Conversely, Bluewater has a 12"" pipeline less than a quarter mile from Acadia Estates, and could have water to the area within a few months--which is certainly a reasonable time. Because Bluewater also has $4mil in loans to the federal government, the City would satisfy all the requirements to be protected from any attempted encroachment by TWS. Bluewater's water service qualifies as an association, has loans for Bluewater Co, and has physical and legal ability to service the area. 

Finally, from a practical standpoint, TWS lacks actual harm, and therefore standing to bring suit. Because they as yet have no entitlement to servicing the area prior to the issuance of a new CCN, they cannot claim any harm. All harm asserted in your letter is purely speculative. If you file a suit against the city in this matter, we will move for dismissal with prejudice, and also seek Rule 11 sanctions for our fees and costs for handling this frivilous suit. 

Sincerely,

Applicant

**Overall, this was very good. However, you make your writing more effective and structured, I would recommend providing more subheadings through your essay. Remember that the graders will have a checklist in front of them with criteria of which to grade. The easier you make it for them, the more points you will get. Provide headings that introduce the point you are going to make or the law which you will apply.

Overall, though, good**"

"event","ok, my last semester of law school was insanely busy. my trademark moot court competition was a huge success: my team took 3rd regionally, 9th in the nation, and we had the 5th best brief in the nation. this is up against ~15-25 schools per region (4 regions).

i continued to see W up until a few days before graduation when he shipped off for basic training in the navy. he was the perfect rebound, and as i rushed headlong into finals and graduation, i felt like i was back in a place similar to when i first started law school--namely, that i was ready to be by myself and focus on myself. in other words, not seeing anyone. 

graduation was a blast. dad, trina, and crystal came out for it. then dad, after driving all the way up from tuscon, az, caravaned with me to chicago and helped me move in. he's so amazing. it's kinda scary though, because he'll be 73 this month, and he's starting to get tired more easily and his hearing is not as good. he's definitely not used to taking it easy, so this is a big change for him. i can't wait till i can get some property and build him a little house next to mine, then he can winter in az and i won't worry about him as much. 

everything has been so back to back lately. i've been working on bar prep, and it's ridiculous. it's not that it's terribly difficult material, it's just literally over EVERYTHING, so it's alot of memorization in a very short amount of time. besides exercising, it's about all that i do. i don't even have weekends. 

going to gaia for heartland was amazing as always, and i've vowed to go for the entire weekend next time because i won't have to drive three days after taking finals. :) of course i met a guy while i was there, but who knows what will come of that. this guy was really really into me at first, but now i think he's lost interest. it's frustrating because i want to find some one, but kind of a relief because the last thing i want right now is to worry about a long distance relationship (which always have gone so well for me in the past). but for all my independence, i really like making someone happy, and i like to have someone to snuggle with at night. i'll cast it to the wind and let things fall where they may, i suppose. i wish it would just happen already; that someone would decide that i was the one for them, and be downright unmovable. oh well. 

my chicago apartment is great. i'm all moved in except going through a bunch of papers and putting them in my filing cabinet. the cats love the bay windows, and their cat tower is front and center so they can snooze and stare to their hearts' content. no more yard, but i did take them to the park on their leashes (carried them there in a basket) to play in the grass and watch the birds and bikers. it went well, and i think i'll try a weekly outing with them. maybe someday they will actually be walked on their leashes, which will simplify things greatly. 
people are pretty nice here, except my neighbor across from me keeps borrowing things, and it's getting annoying because i feel like i'm starting to be taken advantage of by her. the lake trail is right outside my building, and running and biking are the way to go. i'll restart my p90x videos soon, but for now i'm enjoying being out in the wind and doing some serious people watching on the trail.

the bar is the last week of july, and after that i'll need a job to get me by while i hunt for a career-position and await my results. until then i'm doing little else but studying. feeling very zen for the most part, but occasionally i get rather lonely at night. my tomato plant is dark green and growing like mad now that i gave him a larger pot and he has the bay window (south facing) to bask in. i also got some lavender, rosemary, basil, cilantro, and catnip. chainsaw's the only one interested, and he wants to nibble on the lavender of all things! oh, and he's also on a diet now that i can feed them separately (velcro's food is up where chainsaw can't jump to), and doing better than i thought he would. 

wishing everyone well, and will likely post more again now that law school is over. thank goddess, it is actually over."

"event","well, i am officially 29 as of Jan 27th. I'm looking forward to 30 because it's becoming the new 'coming of age' year, i think. like hobbits and their 33. and to think that a few hundred years ago, you were a fully functional adult at 12! that is a place hard to conceive (not pun). i feel like i didn't even figure out who i was until i was 24-25 in japan. and that was primarily because it was the first time i'd been on my own and lived alone; and that gives a person time to think and find their inner light. ever since then, i've been healthier and happier (*tempered with the realities of law school, please*), a gradual transitioning that is never completed. the Journey. i think this is what life is for me; trying to enjoy every moment as much as i can consciously, as well as grow in beauty/complexity. humanity is capable of the most extraordinary things, and i am human. 

semester continues to rock as far as my schedule. i've been able to find time to workout every day; and it feels great. it's been hard to get motivated for some of my projects because i never really had much of a break over the holidays. but it's getting better because my schedule is so pleasant compared to what i'm used to. i have been very pumped about my national trademark moot court competition. it is next weekend. our region competes at the 9th cir. court of appeals in san fran! :) i've been getting very high feedback from our practice judges (professors and intellectual property attorneys), one attorney said i was the best speaker out of the 8, and my coach from last semester, Dean Williams, (who has seen me speak ALOT) said that i was taking it to a new level. :) i am totally going to get a big ego at this rate. 

my research projects as a research assistant are pretty sweet. just really getting into things now: there are two large crates of starter reading before i even get into the new stuff! classes are good. the best is definitely employment discrimination, professor beckett is SUCH a good professor! i wish i'd known sooner, i'd have taken her earlier.

W was a great idea. :) he's been very good medicine; see him a couple times a week (generally weekends so far), very cute and sweet but i don't feel obligated at all. he brought over this cute bean bag turtle for me to 'borrow' and he invited me paintballing for valentine's weekend. and just so gosh darn handsome--gracious! i've gained a new appreciation for baseball bodies (i've always been partial to soccer bodies before). 
still getting over emotional breakup stuff, but really feeling 'normal' again for the last month. 

more than anything i'm looking forward to finishing law school, and moving to chicago to take the bar! i will be in a cool, new city; i will be able to focus on just bar prep for almost two months, then i will be DONE! it will be a luxury to not have 5million things going on at once, well before i start my practice, that is. i'm going to LOVE being an ip attorney; i know it's what i'm supposed to do! the law just clicks with me, and i get really passionate about it. yeah, the job market sucks; but i'm one of a few people with a science background, and i'm very specialized into what i want to do. it'll happen. and it will be great to be in the midwest. and i'll be able to head down to ks with greater frequency than from washington. i will find an adorable yoga studio, and a farmer's market. i will find a pub, and get a bartender who knows what i like to drink! anyway, (museums, biking, public transportation, food, ect!) i await that time with much anticipation! 

not sure what else... my tomato plant is doing well, but getting a very tall branch. later today i'm having photos taken of me for my graduation announcements. if you would like one, please send me your address. :) ok, take care!"

"event","does anyone else think there's something different between the general mourning of a relationship and the rejection/validation thing? well, the second part of that just got alot easier, which is good because i'm two months out from the break up.
i had to cut off talking to r a little over two weeks ago. i'd reached my limit, and he'd been progressively treating me poorly. but doing that felt like a whole new loss, and i felt extra bummed out. 
delena to the rescue. 
d came to town for the weekend, and we went out to watch improv and then karaoke. at the improv place was a really cute guy volunteering there as an usher. D's known him for four years, so he's not a crazy person. but he is 21, has never had a girlfriend, and is shipping off for navy basics 5 days before i graduate law school. delena didn't have to nudge either of us much; we hit it off pretty fast. anyway, he's very good looking (baseball body, blue-blue eyes, and lovely nose), and let's face it: i'm single and i'll do what i want. we saw eachother again later that weekend, and went for a walk through the park on a relatively warm evening, talking for almost 2hrs. 
we made plans for this weekend, and it was a blast. 
friday evening i took him to melissa's birthday party, and got to show him to my girlfriends and watch evil dead 2. he took me home, and when he left, he 'casually' left his hat for me to wear/borrow. :) we hungout again today: starting with the Spoo5k cemetery run, then indian buffet lunch, then trigun eps on the couch, then cute snuggles in my room, then grabbed sandwiches for dinner. he walked me to the door and kissed me good night. i think he will be the perfect rebound, especially if he keeps calling me gorgeous and saying i have beautiful eyes! oh, and he's always kissing the tip of my nose, which is also very cute.
he's going to take me paint-balling, and i'm going to be a hiking/running/workout buddy for him to get ready for basic this summer. his name is william."

"event","Winter break was lovely! the company was great. we cooked till the cows came home and crawled into the oven! i don't usually eat meat, but everyone else does, so over a week and a half we cooked: 16lbs turkey, 2 whole chickens, 8lbs of liver, 3lbs of bacon, and 20lbs of meatloaf! oy! let's just say i'm thoroughly meated-out!

we went out on snowy hikes: bowl and pitcher, dishman hills, and mount spokane (this one was snow shoes!!). saw the pony for the longest amount of time since we both left ks for grad school; it was much needed. before everyone descended it was just dad and i for a few days, which was great. i can't wait to purchase property so dad and i can live together! separate houses, of course. :) sweet brendan drove all the way from GA, and hit every patch of bad weather possible here and back. erika stayed the longest, and we had a great time with just the two of us around new years. 

after that the house emptied, jeff returned, and he and i dug into our moot court brief writing (i'm doing trademark, he's doing international). and that's where things have been until yesterday when the other roomies made it home. today is the first day of classes for my last law school semester; and i couldn't be more happy about finishing! my schedule looks great too, but busier than i had originally planned. 
grades from fall were satisfactory! i pulled a 3.57 for the semester, which puts me on the Dean's list again. highest grade: admiralty law! that's right, my international whaling regulation paper was a smash! ;) 

been missing ryan. his company can be hard to beat, and i had become used to talking to him regularly. it's a very very good thing that we're so far apart right now, because we would be spending time together if we were close and that would end badly. we've discussed how we're both glad for the distance because we are both adjusting to not being a couple. hopefully with time and distance we'll be ready for a solid friendship to start up in the summer. 
i've had a hard time understanding what i'm feeling about him alot of the time, and have been working on it in meditation. it's hard to believe that it's only been 1.5mo since we broke up! ryan even thought it'd already been 4 months, when we spoke around his birthday. he's going through a process too, which while understandable, part of me wants to scream, ""but isn't the point of you breaking up with me because you are 'over' me?"" of course, it's not that simple.
mostly i'm trying to actually process this transition without becoming bitter about romance. 

this semester, i have three classes, a trial set in march, and a moot court competition in feb. i'm also being a paid research assistant for a professor, and still doing club prez stuff. sunday's will be job hunt day as i plan my migration to chicago! 
anyway, that's me."

missing friends and family. wish i had time to go visit everyone and call more often. i think that will be a big advantage to just having a day job, even if it's 60+hrs a week: it's less than law school. i get weak in the knees just thinking about having weekends again. a regular schedule = happiness. 
looking forward to getting alot done this break. the tree is up, and dad, pony, erika, and brendan will be joining me for a good 'ole family christmas. :) and i've decided to run a holiday-themed rpg with them while everyone's here! :D should be alot of fun.
feeling good about things in general, but i can certainly tell i'm going through an adjustment period. not that i've had much time free beyond studying, but i've been enjoying some increased solitude over finals. weekly solstice choir practice is really fun and cleansing!"

"event","it's taking me some time to decide where to start. things have been crazy busy. the spring semester ended very well; i was placed on the Dean's List for my good grades. Honduras for spring break was very rewarding. I made the highest score in International Intellectual Property, and the second highest score (1 of 2 A's in the entire class) in Constitutional Law II. Bam! My roommate Sean and i made a garden, worked-in over 20lbs of compost we had made over the year, and planted all sorts of things (tomatoes, tomatillos, swiss chard, zucchini, onions, carrots, sugar snap peas, radishes, corn, acorn squash, lettuce, and string beans). we left the watering up to rommie Jeff, because we both had summer externships. Summer was interesting. First, Ryan graduated, and moved to Madison, WI to study and take (and pass!) the bar. I went to Lawrence, KS to work in the Douglas County District Court with an excellent judge. 
R and I slugged our way through finals (we had two classes together), then hurriedly packed his stuff. he graduated the weekend after finals, his parents came in and packed like superheros, and I was able to work on packing my truck (Black Mamba)for the summer. three days after ryan's graduation, we both take off together in our vehicles, drive all day, and camp in a forrest north of Yellowstone. My cats have their own tent to play in, but go in the car to sleep in case of bears. that night suddenly became our 'last night' before we were officially in a long distance relationship. 
I stop at my dad's, stay the day and night, then make my way to Loveland where my Aunt Clara feeds me, and my Cousin Sarah shelters me, and it was lovely. Make it to KC, C's house to be specific. She was amazing enough to put up with my two cats on top of her two kittens (who recently turned 1 yr!) for the entire summer! *applause* I had an interesting summer in two homes: at C's in KC with the kitties on the weekend, and at Tuck's in Eudora for the work week. Before the heat advisories got crazy, i did some biking to work. it was nine miles one-way, and through a classic slice of Kansas: beautiful! I would shower in the female police officers' locker room and change for the day; hope that my biking clothes would dry out during the day, then put them back on and bike back when it got late enough to cool off. and yes, i still have my mountain bike, the Blue Mare. she's very ...sturdy. i've decided that when i get my first paycheck as an attorney, i will get myself a nice road bike: i'm really ready for the extra speed. :) 
it was nice hanging with T and C for the summer. there was alot of cooking. C and i were all about the veggies, T and i ended up being half and half (which worked out). i had my own room at both places, and the back and forth hopefully made me less of a burden. i had issues with my financial aid, and didn't receive my summer check until the day before i left Kansas. thankfully, i have the best dad in the world.
at court, i worked on some pretty interesting and intense cases. i watched a high publicity trial. it was a worthwhile experience. it was nice to work in lawrence, but i found that i did not have very much time to do the fun things that i had planned. i was able to go to pagan rituals with my group, and i did some house sitting at Cedar Springs: which was amazing! i learned so much this summer about gardening: i'm itching to start doing my own thing!
over the summer R and i managed to see eachother once a month. i got to see Madison (sweet town!) and show lawrence and Camp Gaia to him. he was able to meet alot of my friends, even a sauna pot luck was held. it was most excellent. when i left kansas at the end of the summer, the cats and i went up to madison for a few days (i biked, and he rented a canoe for us) then drove across to my dad's for a few more days (hiking and huckleberry picking). in case you are wondering: the cats have harnesses, and i loop their leashes through the passenger 'oh shit' bar. they can go where they want, except in my foot well. they were both very good travelers. 
everyone was happy to get home. J had done a great job watering the garden, and there were all sorts of things growing! we managed to get a TON of food from our garden over the last few months, and had been enjoying tomatoes until just last week. the cats, who had done very well the few times that i had taken them out to the farm and let them free-range for a day, started having more yard privileges, and i'll let them out during the day for sometimes up to an hour in the backyard by themselves. they chill, eat grass, and chase falling leaves or bugs. if they leave the back yard, they have to come inside. i always have to pick up chainsaw, but i can snap my fingers, and velcro will run inside because he doesn't want to be left alone. 
school started with a fury; particularly because i began my work on the Nat'l Health Care Moot Court Competition. we (team of three) had a month to research and write a supreme court-style brief. ours ended up being 60 pages long. it was intense. as soon as that was turned in, we had a month of oral argument practice for the Nov competition. during this semester, i also put in 20hrs every week in the clinic. i have a limited license to practice law in the state, and my professor supervisors assign me cases, and i do the legal work. we take low-income clients. i primarily do family law cases. i've taken depositions this semester, and had a motion hearing before a judge. for classes i'm taking: non-profits, patent prosecution, advanced trademark, and admiralty/maritime law (i have to write a 30 pg paper for that one: on whales!).
the long-distance relationship thing hasn't been going very well. we have seen eachother once in the last three months: that was for my cousin's wedding reception in kc. i flew into WI, watched R get sworn into the bar, we visited my Aunt Francie and Uncle Art, then drove down to KC for the weekend. it was nice to show him around, and even better to be with him. but when we're apart for more than a month, we seem to have a hard time feeling like we're even in a relationship. anyway, between his campaign work during the midterm election (and job hunt, and student loan payments on the horizon, and ect.), and my moot court competition R feels like he might be done with 'us'. this just happened in the last two weeks. he's been honest about his feelings, and is planning on flying over here next weekend so we can end things in person. i really couldn't ask for more. and it's not like he cheated on me or anything, like the d-bag. i've had a splendid and romantically-epic time over the last year and a half, and i hope we can have an equally amazing friendship. 
that's where i am now. i have started work on my second moot court competition (this time it's trademark!), and my admiralty paper is due in a couple of weeks. 
for christmas, looks like my dad, erika, and the pony will be joining me! :) i'm getting a tree and a turkey, and we'll hope for snow."

"event","Wow, it's been a LONG time since i've posted!! sorry, but fall semester was totally nuts! i was taking hard classes, working for a judge here at superior court, and still logging in time at the AG's. then as soon as finals were over, i hopped on a plane to KS and spend two wonderful weeks there with friends and family. i flew back to spokane for a couple of days, then hit the road with ryan and our friend sean for some lovely camping and hiking in the redwoods. and now the new semester is underway! i'm taking cool classes (constitutional law II, International IP, IP transactions and licensing, conflicts of law, professional responsibility, and good ole' legal research and writing) this semester, and only working at the AG's (the clerkship was only for a semester).

Still in the safe haus with my roomies, and it's great. the four of us have committed to the next year together as well, which will be swell. it's been nice to come home to people and the cats and to feel like it is my home as well as theirs. i'm still biking to and fro all the time, but with a new backpack that has more pockets and is water resistant! didn't take yoga AT ALL last semester (sad but true), but i'm taking it tues nights with ryan this semester, and it's lovely. 

had a birthday this week just past. i am officially 28. my birthday reminds me of my mother, for obvious reasons, and i wish that i could fill her in on everything i've been up to; i miss her terribly at times.

the cats are good. velcro has become more and more ""normal"", but i'm certain at this point that he's autistic (probably thanks to my d-bag ex who gave him kitty drugs when he was tiny and undeveloped mentally). fortunately, he's a cat, so it's not a huge disadvantage. my roommates love him, and he gets along with them in his own way. chainsaw is also good, and becoming quite clever with opening doors and hiding places. chainsaw gets along with my roommates as well, but his house nickname is ""fatty"", but (as his mother) i still don't see it. he loves ryan, though, and it's always cute when ryan comes over and chainsaw wants kisses from him. :)

and yes, ryan and i are great! :D i can't believe it's been ~10months since we started dating! he makes me incredibly happy on a regular basis, and i hope i do the same for him (i think i probably do). i'm trying not to worry too much about what will happen after he graduates this spring, because i have another year of law school one way or the other, but we're hoping it will work out with us together. i dunno, i may have found my hippie life partner, stay tuned!

what life have i outside of law school? besides occasional msgs or calls to friends and family, and LFD2 with crystal and the pony on friday nights, not much. for instance: i studied fri till 6, took a break till 11 (playing computer games), then read cases till ~130am; woke up at 9, and have been here at school working till about an hour ago when i became completely unmotivated. :P there will be a full day of studies tomorrow as well. /shrug/ this is my life. 

i hope ya'll are well, hope things are going great for you. if i haven't spoken with you in a while, forgive me and shoot me a line whenever!

oh, and i thought obama's state of the union was really good, but hated his environmental portion: nuclear, ""clean"" coal, biofuels, and offshore drilling?!?! who the hell are you kidding?! everytime i hear him say anything about the earth, i come away from it feeling like i've been listening to bush! eewww! i don't understand why he panders to the republicans when it's the environmentalist democrats who got him elected. it should be a top priority! ok, that's my 2cents."

"event","wow, my summer has been flow by in a very summery-type way. 
next week i take my final for federal indian law, then head out on a long road trip with ryan to stop at many national parks (great redwood, yosimite, death valley, grand canyon, and zion) for hiking and camping, and meeting his parents (eek).

my dad came to visit just after i moved into the house. we had a great time, but it was a short visit. then crystal came to visit for nearly a week, and that was a blast too. while she was in town we had our house party, and it was way fun. my roomie sean got a 16gal keg on amber ale from the local brew: northern lights. the next day there was 5gal left, which we proceeded to drink the next day in the lawn via beer pong with the sprinklers on. yay, summer! 

i've been biking hither and tither, and it has been grand. i love hoping on my bike in the morning and flying around town in warm-weather clothes. the low humidity of the area is nice because while the sun is super hot, the shade and the breeze are quite refreshing. river front park, the park in the middle of spokane abutting the north side of the downtown area, has always been a big part of my time here in spokane. i bike or walk through it every day practically to get to and from home, school, and work. the grass is well tended and it's lovely to head to a green and lush field after work, find some shade, and read. 

right around when i was moving i banged my left ankle on three separate occasions. it's still at least twice as big as my right ankle. i'm going to try to get it looked at before the trip since i'll be doing so much hiking. 

so, i'm in this house with three guys from school. so far so good. we've settled in for the most part, and the house is really cute. i've started a compost pile in the back and we've set up a clothesline and a bike lean-to. it's nice to live around others again, i haven't done it in while. and i've certainly never done the college house scene. i'm enjoying it. we live about 4 blocks from school, a block from a dive bar that does karaoke, and 200 yards from the grocery store. my summer class, which my roomie jeff is also in, is W R F from 530-830pm. on thurs nights (tonight) we've (about 8 of us; rommies plus other friends) gotten in the habit of going over for the karaoke night, taking turns buying cheap pitchers for eachother, some of us singing occasionally, then walking home. we don't have AC, and i live in the hottest room in the house, but i love it! all you need is a little fan blowing on you and it's just fine. i bring a sweater with me to work and school to hold off the unnatural cold. 

work at the attorney general's office has continued it's trend. my attorney let me write the persuasive memo in support of a motion for summary judgment in federal court! it was a TON of work in a short amount of time, but i got it done, AND i think i dd well! we have to file it next week! my attorney said from the beginning that we likely would have to go to trial on this (aka the motion for the summary judgment), but it will be close. so it's possible that i might convince a federal judge to go our way! 

oh, and i was awarded a scholorship for IP law, so that's pretty cool.

well, that's about all that's been going on with me. i hope ya'll are well! :)"

my trip home and to the tetons was AMAZING! so much so that i felt completely out of place when i got back to spokane. i got my final grades. they were ok; except contracts for some reason--it killed my GPA! :( but summer class and classes in the fall should make things up. got re-connected with spokane by hanging with the puma posse (elena, lindsay, and melissa), and gettting to ride my bike again for the first time in two weeks! 

things continue to go well with ryan and i. it's funny (funny's not really the right word), i feel that i am a fairly well put-together person (as in: i know myself pretty well) except for this whole ""starting to build a serious relationship"" thing. it's like a muscle i haven't used since i was 18. i find myself reacting to a situation, but when i stop and think about it, i realize that my reaction has nothing to do with reality, but is more of a long-forgotten reflex. it's really strange! i'm learning who i am in this sphere of life, which is good, but it is also a challenge! ryan's been there every step of the way, being so understanding, wanting to talk about it, and letting me find what works for me (since i don't know and have been discovering it). he's just amazing. we're feeling out schedules right now: we want to see eachother several times a week, but not all the time (i love how independent we both are). it's such a contrast from perhaps having about 30min apart over the 5 days we were in the tetons together, which was great but is not how we want to run things all summer! anyway, so i'm discovering him and myself in all this and it's such a good thing. i really feel like we're doing this right, and i can't wait to see where it takes us. 

i have 20 days till i move into my new house with my new roomies. i'm really excited! but besides getting my boxes out of storage, i haven't started packing yet! i better get on that. ;) ok, i'm off to work outside today in comfy clothes (contrast from a/c and business suits the rest of the week). who knows what i'll get up to this weekend, except one day will be things i need to get done, and one day will be with my man (hiking and chillin no doubt).

i've posted picks from my trip on the blogspot (oasis pics link at the top of my lj), check them out if you like. love and hugs to all-a-ya'll. kansas peeps: i had a great time, and i miss you already. all other peeps: i hope to see you soon and send you mental hugs in the meantime. :)"

"event","ok, finals are over!! i've finished my first year of law school!! whew! i think it went well, but i won't know till grades get in at the beginning of june. 

i officially have a ""man"". he's in law school, focusing on environmental law, a hiker and biker, he's wonderful on the guitar, we've been on a blues kick together (i've been rocking the harmonica!). he's amazing and we resonate off eachother. i've basically been floating through these last 3-4 weeks. his name is ryan. 

i'm in kansas! i spent the weekend after finals finding a truck camper shell from a salvage yard--which is super sweet! then three days of driving to get here. it's camping this weekend, then chilling in ks in general till thurs when i head for the tetons. ryan's flying into the tetons on sat, and we're hanging out with my dad and going hiking then driving back together. we both are working at the washington state attorney general's office this summer. 

anyway, this was short and sweet. oh, and there are pics up on the blogspot if you want to check it out. wish you all well!"

"event","welcome to finals. 5 tests, 2 weeks, no life. well that's not entirely true, but close enough. it's a marathon to the finish line. i think the hardest part is productively studying right after a test (three-hr essays worth the entire grade), when your brain is mush.

took my first this morning: civil procedure. i think it went pretty well. 

i have some other awesome news, but it's not time to share it yet. all in good time. ;)

went out last weekend, drinking and dancing to blues was phenomenal."

"event","*i wrote this yesterday but was too busy with my research test to remember to post it*

OK! at 9am on wed morning, wearing a suit, i turned in my final memorandum! no more while i be up till 4am writing a paper for three days in a row! 
now it's the research test tonight (think library scavenger hunt), then last week of class next week. so, after tonight it's just getting ready for finals from here on out! whew!

understand. it's not like i didn't get right on my research paper. i worked on it long and hard for the past two weeks between all the regular school stuff. by the time i'd turned it in i was running on about 8 hrs of sleep in the last three days. tues night i only took a 1.5 hr nap, and it was time that i really needed for working, but it had gotten to the point where my brain was mush and it would be faster to nap, then work faster. 

when things get that crazy for that long, it starts to become about endurance, pacing, and efficiency. you can't just work without sleep for a week straight, and you need time in there (even if it's short) to relax or you'll burn out. yoga on tues night was great before burning through that night and the next day. we did a meditation exercise about meeting the divine mother in our heart chakhra. suddenly i was in cedar springs and weaver was large and growing near the sauna, the divine mother appeared to me in the form of G*. janice, who was leading the class, first had us focus on who she was and what she looked like, then how she saw us and what she thought of us. a wave of love washed over me and i lost it. it was a humbling and powerful experience, and i really took the energy from that to get me through the night. 

it was great to turn in that paper, which everyone in the class had clawed their way through, and come out the other side. i made it through classes. then went with some classmates and my contract's prof to this presentation we were putting on at the business school about identifying legal issues in business planning. it went well.

i'd been wearing a suit all day for the presentation that evening since i wasn't going to have time to go home and change after the 9am paper due date. i finally got to change into pjs, chillax with a friend, then get some sleep. 

oh, and i finally got a summer job. looks like i'll be heading to kansas after finals till the end of may, stopping to see dad coming and going, then coming back to spokane. i'll be working for the washington state attorney general's office, in the torts division in spokane. it will be some great experience! then i'll be taking federal indian law in summer school, and in july i'll be moving into a house with some classmates. i think chainsaw and velcro will love running around a whole house and looking out all the windows from almost every angle. and at somepoint in the summer i'll be house sitting for one of my favorite professors. :) should be a good summer."

"event","ok, after a weepy phone call to my dad (for the record, everyone at school is half-crazy with the workload, there's been spontaneous weeping all week), hugging chainsaw (who always tolerates it when i'm sad), ranting on lj (see previous private post), running (goddess, that felt good!), and knuckling down in the law school library for the past 6 hrs (yeah, and i'd make it 8-9hrs if they didn't have to kick me out at midnight); i'm feeling better. 

it's not this guy in particular (god knows they're plentiful: quantity), its the total lack of quality in the whole damn batch! ok, i know that's not true. i'm just so bleeding tired of this hit-and-miss shit. why can't the perfect partner just walk up to me and already love me forever? that would make things so much easier. *sigh* i know i'm sounding bitter, and that's kinda how i feel at the moment. i don't think it will last; i'm too much of a hopeless romantic to actually be hopeless. 

ok, back to work. just one more hour till they force me out! i'm making good progress on my research. i actually bought coffee drinks for these next couple of late nights, which is shocking for those who know i never drink coffee. i just hope i don't become addicted; coffee is not someone i want to have as a common bedfellow. ;)"

"event","had a long dream this morning with francis in it. it's amazing how meeting one person for only a period of about 3weeks can really change your perspective in life. 
just as i was hitting the first year of being single after my only real relationship (7.5 years of it, mind you). after going through the dating scene for a year and becoming thoroughly burnt out on it. something about being on the cusp of leaving and leaping into a new life phase left my heart more open, less cautious. 
and could it have been more perfect to meet at a camping music festival at gaia, dancing around a bonfire to drums on a warm kansas night?
francis taught me that romance: real, raw, sweep-you-off-your-feet romance; is alive and well. there was something breathtaking about seeing him again in lawrence after he'd biked 50 miles to come see me. and something surreal about him cooking me breakfast the next morning. 
he proved to me, at last, that there are men out there who do fit into this fantasy ideal in my mind. and that i will never have to settle for less than ""just right for me."" i think the next time a francis rolls/dances/hikes up to me, i'll know it. until then i'll be content to myself, living this independent existence; looking forward to the day that i find someone who complements me (not completes me).
so, thank you, francis."

"event","so over the last year/ year and a half, everytime i pick up tarot cards, the fool pops up. he is a symbol of momentum and change, but also of caution. pay attention to where you are going or you might slip and fall. i think the fool has become a reminder to me to keep it on task for law school.

this semester has been ""ugh."" too much to do and not enough time to do it. my friends from school feel the same. plus, awesome things to give me an excuse to do other things: honduras, erika's visit, and dana's visit. 

i've been taking this ""women in the kundalini"" class at my yoga center. it's been lovely. 5 women ( i am one of two under 60) meeting to explore the chakhras through different exercises then talk about our thoughts and impressions together and trying to figure out what we are telling ourselves. it's fun!

anyway, last week we did this hearing exercise for the 5th chakhra, and one of the bells (a small, stumbling cow bell) i realized was the fool popping up again! i explained to the rest of the women what the fool was in my life right now, and how this semester i was working to strike that balance between too much and too little work, and that i currently felt i was a too far towards the play side of things. 

then yesterday i mentioned this overwhelmed feeling to a prof and he said that's exactly how i should feel. that made me feel a little better and a little more accepting about it all. 

later that evening i had a meeting for this volunteer project i and a few other guys from class are helping our contracts prof with the business school. we're doing a presentation about identifying legal issues in business planning. anyway, sitting around the table, brainstorming up this presentation was so much fun! i felt that excitement and joy inside me that i used to get everytime i debated in high school. this is why i want to be an attorney!

sure i love learning, which is a good thing since most of my life has been spent in an academic setting. but i'm finally to the point where my pure love of study can no longer support this load i'm bearing. i needed this affirmation; this reminder of what is coming when this is over. i'll finally be able to start a career doing something i LOVE, doing something i am passionate about, and doing something that i hope will make a difference in the world. 

this reaffirmation fed into last night's kundalini class. we were working with the 6th chakhra: the mind. for all the mental exercises i found i was being very analytical and organized about things; and while that was limiting to an extent, it was also liberating--i felt free to move about in the constructs of my mind. it feels like home in there still. i've been so worried about losing my soul and my creative nature through the law school process, but i don't think that's a fear anymore. i think i am already creative in a way that is completely compatable with my future as an attorney. and that feels pretty good. :)"

"event","well, i made it back! alot has happened! so, let's do the sensible thing and start from the beginning and go to the end. 

people on the trip: jenna (foul-mouthed sailor), lorien (high-spirited queen of having fun), brian (big sweetie), ben (on his way to being grizzled), meredith (sassy trivia master), greg (laid-back wise-one), megan (generally amiable and relatively quiet), abby (goofy and sweet), eldy (pint-sized group mom, also native honduran), julie (quite and unexpectedly hilarious), leanne (nurse and master mediator), brad (goof), and genna (me). 

there had been snow on the pass to seattle, so we pushed back our departure to 9pm. the drive to seattle was fast-paced with three cars and a dozen people. we arrived at jenna's parents' house in the wee hours and crashed in their basement for a few hours of sleep before getting up the next morning. i took a shower. their house has an amazing view of downtown seattle (with space needle) and mt. rainier. after finally getting out the door and to the airport, there was a little trouble with a cop running the numbers on jenna's beatup car wrong and thinking it was stolen, which was ridiculous. we finally got through and onto the plane. take off was brilliant, saw mt. rainier and mt. st. helens. i must hike up them now, they look so cool! 

long flight to atlanta, got there around 8pm, went with the group to a motel they'd decided on and had dinner before smitha picked me up. had tea at a fancy coffee shop before crashing sometime after 2am, only to get up at 6am to head back to the airport. 
back through airport security and onto honduras! 

saw honduras from the air, it was green and lovely! it was so nice to land and be greeted by warm and humid air. someone remarked when we landed that after this point there would be no more toilet paper in the toilets; honduran toilets can't handle it for some reason, so your tp goes in the trash. we grabbed all our bags and met eldy, who had flown in earlier to see her family. she'd already rented the cars (an suv and busita). we loaded up and headed out. there was an amazing amount of trash and litter everywhere. the city, san pedro, that we were leaving was crowded, hot, and impoverished. the driving is interesting. pretty slap-dash and the signs and passing lines are really only guidelines. lots of small beat-up trucks. and it seemed like alot of people just stood around on the side of the road and watched cars going by, this must be entertainment. also, alot of stray dogs everywhere. 

we eventually moved out of the city and into the mountains, where the breeze was cool but everything still warm enough to keep the windows down. it was soooooo nice to ride with the windows down and my flip-flops on! it was about 4hours driving to get to lepaera, lempira. the town/villiage we were to stay in was adorable! the family we stayed with, cheris (i think i'm spelling this right) was kind and welcoming. the father, cheris (he goes by the family name), is an auto mechanic, his wife was very motherly over all of us and also a teacher at the school we were working with, the eldest daughter is married so wasn't around much, but the son, armando, is in high school, and the youngest daughter, marlen, still in grade school (4th grade). cheris had also taken in a boy about his son's age, marvin, who worked in the shop. and there was also hector (tito) who worked in the shop and lived in the back building with marvin. tito is 20 and muy guapo. ;) 

the landscape was beyond breathtaking. but there was litter everywhere where people lived. without proper trash service, people just drop things on the ground. also, the water was unsafe to drink, everyone had to purchase water in bottles and bags, and the water only ran for part of the time (usually turned off during the day so mornings frequently became a race to wash up before everything went down to a trickle). for this service group, the city/school decides what project they want us to work on; this year they wanted us to paint the inside of one school's gym, and two classrooms in another school. now, given all the need that i could see around us: the litter, the lack of clean water, ect, ect; i couldn't figure out why they would want us to paint a gym! after all the money and time we'd put into getting ourselves to honduras, given all the skills and strengths available between the 13 of us, why painting? it felt like something easy for us to do. i mean, it was work! it was alot of painting! but i am hard pressed to see how some oil paint on some cinder blocks would help the lives of these people. 

where i did feel that we made a difference was with the school supplies we'd brought to some 150 children, and in the interactions we had with them, the family we stayed with, and people in the village. 

oh, and i totally want to marry tito and make him my hot, latin husband!

the evenings were best! we'd work all day and get on eachother's nerves, talked about bowel movements at every possible moment (you go somewhere that it's dangerous to get the runs, and then everyone's asking at every meal!), and just generally tried to take it all in and enjoy the hell out of it. well, we'd get done, then there would be some sort of fantastic honduran dinner, and it would slowly get dark, but the the temperature would be perfect! and the mountains would stay visible, then the full moon would rise over them, and Orian would hang to the side, as the international space station orbited by. my, god! it was beautiful. then it would be cold and good honduran beer on the pourch, playing drinking games, playing soccer with the family, or just talking about whatever, learning more about eachother. taking it all in. sleeping on mats, in sleeping bags, right next to eachother with the windows open all night.

after those days in paradise, we headed out, for COPAN. my pics are up, check em out people! it. was. sweet.

so, the trip was great! on the way back we had time for a meal in ATL, and then when we landed in Seattle at midnight on a friday night, i started getting sick with food poisoning! the car i was in was driving home that night. i ended up miserable in the front seat, the leanne having to pull over every half an hour or so for me to be sick (one way or the other) on the side of the highway. then, 40 miles out side of town, the driver swerves while leaning for her cell phone, we start fishtailing, and then roll/flip 3+ times in the grassy median! i had started bracing myself on the ceiling of the car when we started rolling, and as we rolled, the windshield blew out and dirt and glass was everywhere! we landed upside down, and the roof started to collapse under the weight of the vehicle! i unbuckled my seatbelt and was out through the broken window in a hurry! four people got out: leanne, julie, brian, myself; but meredith couldnt' get out, her shoulder was messed up. brian couldn't do much either because he had big pieces of glass sticking out of his hands. we covered meredith with sleeping bags while a truck driver called 911, it was around the time that the ambulance was showing up that my adrenaline started to wear off, and my sickies were back. my blood pressure was so low they put me on an iv and took me to the hospital. well, we all went to the hospital one way or the other (admitted or guest). they ended up putting 2L of saline into me, and injecting me with stuff for the nausea and whiplash. but hey, i made it out pretty well! we were all alive, and that was great! 

so, after 31+hrs of traveling, i finally made it home for a shower and INTENSE sleeping!

"event","wow. last week was one of the longest weeks i've ever had before. and not just for me; most of my classmates (if not all) expressed similar sentiments. it was one of those weeks where everything has piled up at once, included multiple makeup classes from different teachers and a mandatory 1.5hr comp research training class we had to sign up for.

then this weekend was /shrug/. 

next week (not the one that's about to start) is spring break. i'll be in honduras helping people in a small mountain village, and trying desperately to study whenever i have free time. 

i've been feeling this strange combination of overwhelming resolution coupled with persistent bleakness. i feel like i'm struggling to the surface at times. i feel like i'm losing something of myself at times. i feel very much alone most of the time, and it's not even that bothersome; but the fact that i feel so resigned to it makes it somewhat horrible. 

some friends from school and i are thinking of getting a house for next year. i think i'm finally ready to share my living space with other people. /grin/ i've been living alone for over 2.5 years now, and it's only just now starting to lose its bliss. yes bliss: living alone for the past few years has been wonderful for my self growth, and i've really come to love quite time alone. i think the cats would like to have a whole house to run around. none of the other guys have pets, so they'd be the rulers of the roost, so to speak.

last weekend's rugby game went well. i played very well! last week i biked to school without my ski mask on for the first time in about 3-4 months. O_O spring seems to be slowly making its way to spokane, but there is STILL dirty old snow on the ground from mid dec, despite the rain's best attempts. 

friday i had another altercation over the table i like to sit at. people stressed out on papers are weird. but this time, things actually ended with the other person apologizing and seeing things my way! yes, i actually changed a law students mind: it is possible to move mountains. 

i have no patience for someone who asks you out to coffee but then stands you up. no patience whatsoever. 

i want to make a clone to hold down the fort for a month so i can run off to a yoga ashram to meditate and work earth with my hands as my mind is a swiftly flowing stream.  been listening to Krishna Das alot lately (thanks rain and gladrial!). 

i miss mongo."

So, Mongo, the adorable puppy we adopted when i was 12, has just passed away. he was a great, great dog, and a member of my family for the last 16 years. 

when we adopted him from the shelter in OK, my sister and i insisted that his name start with a ""M"" because he had a german shepard-sort marking around his face that looked like the letter ""M"". so, my dad came up with mongo, as in ""Mongo just pawn in game of life""-mongo. 

he was very smart and loving. rather weary of strangers through most of his formative years, me mellowed out to be a complete sweetie to everyone. happy and loving; once i went for a whole year not seeing him, and he was soooooo happy to see me when i finally got back from Japan. one time he tried to snip at my aunt dot because my little sister, katrina, was crying and my aunt was comforting her, but mongo must have thought that my aunt was inflicting the suffering. you could run him anywhere, and he never actually needed a leash; he always stayed close and he always came when you called. 
when he slept outside on nice evenings in OK, he would sleep under my parents' bedroom (amazing guard-dog) and my dad was/is a snorer. after a while, if you pet mongo on the head, and he liked it, he would make a goofy snoring sound: absolutely adorable. 

anyway. i'll be putting up a whole blogspot entry soon with all my mongo pictures, and a really sweet video of him from christmas. so heads up.

"event","well, this has been a crazy-busy week. and right now, i'm hanging out in the portland airport for my 2-hour layover before heading to kansas for a long weekend! :D i'm so excited! so excited in fact, that i forgot my camera this morning. (oh no's!)

and all of this is coming to you from my new laptop. she's a beaut! if you're not big on comp specs, skip the rest of this paragraph. small, slim, lightweight with fingerprint access, bluetooth, built in camera (erika is excited about doing video chats on skype) 2.24Gig processor, 4GB of dual core memory, the 8700 nvidia graphics card, and 500GB of harddrive space! WHEEE! why the upgrade? my other laptop is over three years old now and has been buggy for about half of that. and my battery hasn't held a proper charge for sometime; i get about ten seconds after it's unplugged to plug it back in. the last straw was when my comp didn't properly load my exam software for my contracts final, and i unexpectedly found myself writing by hand (blargh! bluebooks!). plus, so many profs and classmates use the latest word (.docx), which i can't open, that it became necessary to get something new. i've minimized vista's shitty whistles as much as possible, and i think it's pretty workable at this point. 

anyway, been working hard. but somehow not finding as much time to study as i'd like. my first rugby game of spring season is next weekend. whoot! this seasons goal: tackle low (aka don't break my sternum cartilage again). summer job stuff is still going on. at this point i've decided to head back to kansas for the summer. i miss my peeps and the prairie too much. i'm shooting for either a fed level judicial clerkship or a paid internship at an IP firm. either would be great experience as a 1L (first year student).

well, folks, think i'll close this down and play some civ4 while i eat my mac&cheese&tofu&tomato&spinach that i brought with me, and a lady at a mexican cafe was kind enough to microwave for me. *hugs*"

""but i'm going to be 40!""
""when?""
""soon!""
""in 8 years!""
""but it's there, just sitting there like some big dead end!""
this is how 30 is feeling to me. but hey, if meg ryan can do it, so can i! ;)

i don't know how many of you keep up on BSG, but you should! it's in the last half of the last season and holy crap it's good! or should i say: goooooood! :D 

if i could be any fictitious character ever, it would probably be Kara (Starbuck) Thrace. she's strong-willed and stubborn, but she always does what she thinks is best, and she's a true warrior. sometimes i wish i was more of warrior and less of an intellectual. but perhaps this is just me trying to mentally escape from anymore civ pro reading. ;)

i ended up missing two days of classes this week. first, on monday i had surgery. it was a really minor thing, but they had to sedate me so i was pretty out of it for the rest of the day. over the next few days i was all doped up on the pain meds they gave me, and it started to make me really dizzy and nauseous, even though i wasn't even taking the full dose. i was feeling increasingly crappy, so the doctor put me on antibiotics, which i started on thurs, and felt so awful that i couldn't even read. so i went to the doctor, and she assured me that the incision looked fine and to stay on the antibiotics (duh). i slept most of thursday, and by friday the antibiotics were doing their job, and i was my chipper self again. 

for my birthday, about 10 of us went out for dinner and karaoke. it was a nice time.

THERE IS STILL SNOW ON THE GROUND FROM DECEMBER! this rock-hard ice-snow needs to melt so we can get a fresh drop that i can take my new snowshoes out on! :)

i'm currently just a few weeks from my visit home. i'll be in downtown lawrence on the 13th of feb if anyone wants to wander that way. otherwise, i'm pretty busy making up for the time i didn't get to spend with people for yule. 

things are so busy at school. it's really the extras that i haven't gotten to; like summer job stuff. hehe. oh, and there's a letter to a friend that i've been trying to sit down and finish, but i haven't quite found the time. hmmm.

so, greetings from the ice-crusted world of spokane! (i hear ks is enjoying temps in the 70s today *sigh*) seriously, i'm enjoying the winter wonderland, i just wish we'd get some fresh snow around here!

"event","<P>Oh my, it's 2:06am and here I am writing a journal entry. How pathetic is that? Well, its not half as bad as what I'm going to tell you. So, just bear that in mind...yeah. </P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Another attack on a broken heart. ""> </P>
<P>Okay, we went to the airport last Friday afternoon and I <STRONG>knew</STRONG> that James was flying to New Jersey on the same day, but I was hoping to God it wasn't around the same time. The <STRONG>last</STRONG> thing I'd ever want to see is him with Heidi. I knew he didn't go stay at a hotel like he promised he would, why would he do a thing like that when she was so willing to have him sleep over any other time? I didn't think my heart could take actually seeing them together.</P>
<P>Anyways, so we get there and I was looking down at my bag praying&nbsp;for a fun&nbsp;vacation to&nbsp;take my mind off of things. That's when my&nbsp;psuedo-happiness took a turn for the worst. My sister&nbsp;gasped and grabbed me and pointed out the window shouting, ""Ohhh...myyy...God....look!"" I looked and saw James. He was&nbsp;with her next to her red car. They were smiling. If you'd have asked anyone, they looked like a&nbsp;happy couple. </P>
<P>I&nbsp;felt my heart drop out of my&nbsp;chest and jump right back in it...if you know what that&nbsp;feels like, I'm sorry. My mom was thoroughly disgusted and told me, ""He better not come near you. Don't look at them, it'll only make it worse..."" Well, I looked. I couldn't help myself. I was every bit of 50-60 feet away from them, but I could make out everything they were wearing, doing, gesturing, etc as if they were under a microscope. I felt my heart beating faster and faster and this overwhelming sad feeling fell over me. </P>
<P>I don't know if I was sad to see them together, or upset that I had no one to be giving hugs and finger-lock-togethers (as I call them). I was fine when I saw them hugging, but I saw him lean in to give her a kiss. They kept doing it and I felt like a stalker. I just couldn't look away. My mom rushed us inside the building and I was forced to stare out of the windowed doors as they looked lovingly into each others eyes and he touched her face with just the perfect amount of body talk to say, ""I'll miss you..."" </P>
<P>I can't say what hurts worse: knowing that another girl is kissing the boy I was in love with until a month ago, or knowing that until a month ago, I was <STRONG>her</STRONG>. If you've ever seen the ending to the movie Garden State, it's exactly every airport scene James and I have ever met. In fact, our first airport moment was at the Newark airport on the SAME steps they shot the movie on. After a week of meeting each other and falling in ""love,"" we were both in tears and saying our goodbyes. He&nbsp;pulled me close and kissed me every time. He kissed my forehead&nbsp;and told me he'd miss me ""sooo much."" We sat on the stairs of the Newark airport at 5 in the morning holding each other and whispering ""I love you""s...</P>
<P>I stood there for no more than a minute watching the two of them (him in an outfit <STRONG>I</STRONG> picked out and considered one of my ""favorites""). All of those memories of saying goodbye and running over to him to give him a giant hug&nbsp;when I flew in to New Jersey, or when he would arrive in Arizona, came rushing over me. After a while, we were checking in at Delta and he was at some other airline check-in. I would swear to it that he looked right at me for a long moment, but when asked later, he said he never saw me there. </P>
<P>With that last look, we both went our seperate ways and I flew into Florida and&nbsp;he to New Jersey. I couldn't help but wonder what his lips taste like now; it's been so long since he kissed me. I wondered how warm his hugs are now...he hadn't touched me in months. I also wondered why they both said they're&nbsp;""just friends."" I've never&nbsp;in my life, nor do I plan&nbsp;to, kissed a ""friend"" the way they did to each other. I felt so left out of the circle; lonely. I felt cold and sad and for the first time, I realized that Heidi&nbsp;is a real person. </P>
<P>I knew she was&nbsp;a real living human being, but it never occured to me just how ""real"" she was. I just&nbsp;kept pushing her in to the back of my mind as some internet fling James never&nbsp;really got to ""be"" with and that they didn't really have what he and I had together. How wrong I was. Anyhow, every negative bone in my body wanted to call her an ""ugly whore,"" a ""bitch,"" a ""slut,"" etc...but I couldn't. She's none of those. She's just another girl James lured into liking him; who wouldn't? At first impressions, he's a really nice (and caring)&nbsp;guy. </P>
<P>Anyhow, my entire vacation was fixed with fake smiles and forced family photos showing how ""happy"" I was. However, back in the hotel room, in bed at night, I was different. I cried myself to sleep twice thinking about what I'd seen at the airport and how happy he seemed to be with her; like the thought of <STRONG>me</STRONG> being the ""real"" girl was dead. Everytime thereafter when I tried to eat, I felt like I was going to throw up. My mom was surprised. I was eating less then my sister who eats like an anorexic on speed. </P>
<P>On Monday, my aunt and her husband and kids left the hotel and went home. When my mom and sister were at the pool, I got the stupid idea to call James and tell him that I saw him at the airport. I held back tears as long as I could, but they came out anyways. He had Jennifer with him and they were driving around to find job applications and the connection kept going out. I didn't want to call him back, but he called a few times. The tone in his voice was so...""blah."" He didn't seem like the old James who dropped everything he was doing to help me feel better. Hell, he didn't even seem too concerned. </P>
<P>Although, I did hear Jennifer go silent after awhile. I think she may have heard me cry and I'm ashamed of that. There was one thing I wanted to know. I asked him how he planned on proposing to me (yeah, we got that far in our two years). Its something he always said he knew he was going to do, but wanted to surprise me with <STRONG>how</STRONG> he was going to do it. I knew that if he answered that question and told me how he planned on asking me to marry him, there'd be a 100% chance that he really didn't love me anymore and that we'd never get back together. Well, he did answer it. </P>
<P>He told me he planned on asking me in the middle of Times Square during New Year's...just like I'd always said I wanted. I broke down and had to get off&nbsp; the phone. Later that night, against my mom telling me not to, I called him. I was out on the hotel balcony looking down at the pool. The Sheraton Safari Hotel had a great view of the 70 foot snake water slide from there. Anyways, I called him and it was just friendly chatter. He told me he wanted to be at my graduation, but I was glad he wasn't because he would have been there with her. He told me about looking for a job. </P>
<P>Somehow, we got on the topic of how much ""does"" he like Heidi. I asked if he'd done anything more than kissing with her and his line went silent. I could hear nervous laughing on his side and he said, ""Yeah..."" I asked if he did anything that involved going below the waist. He got silent and kinda laughed saying, ""I can't talk about this, Jennifer's right here..."" I just told him to answer <U>yes</U> or <U>no</U> and he said, ""Yes...once, but it was weird..."" I held my breath and again the tears came. All I could say was, ""James..."" with a sad undertone. </P>
<P>I apologized for calling and hung up before he had a chance to say goodbye. I stood out on the balcony looking around at all of the people walking around and how pretty the moon was. I waited for my eyes to dry up and my&nbsp;face not to be red from crying. I went and sat on my mom's bed still feeling numb and tried to eat a piece of pizza. I told her I was going to throw up and she looked at me and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" And I went in to the bathroom, locked the door, stripped down, turned on the water to full blast heat and got in. I tried holding back tears and just sat on the bathtub floor.</P>
<P>I pulled my legs into my chest as tight as they would go and still felt my heart hurting in my chest, even with my legs crunched up trying to stop the pain. I held in big gasps for air and cried to myself. I didn't like the water on my face; it was hot. So, I leaned against the cold tile. After about 10 minutes, I couldn't feel the heat...just pain all over. Then, I stopped holding in the gasps and cried with dry heaving. My mom heard me and tried getting in. I screamed for her to go away and leave me alone. </P>
<P>Eventually, she broke the lock on the door and with tears in her eyes and her voice breaking she said, ""Kaylin, what did he say to make you do this?"" I pulled the shower curtain closed and told her to leave. She sat down on the floor next to the bathtub and switched the water to warm, instead of hot while I tried to hide myself with my legs. She pushed my bangs out of my face and asked me what he said. I told her what he said and that I didn't want to live anymore. I told her the only thing that could end my pain is if I die or he dies and if he died, I'd be even more sad. Her face just fell and she turned the water off, threw a towel around me, and hugged me telling me he's not worth it. </P>
<P>I just kept saying ""Two years. Two years."" I told her that I was with him for two years and gave him everything I had in the first week of knowing him. She put into perspective a few things for me. She said, ""Think about when you guys first had sex. It had been a week. Now with this girl they've barely known each other a month and he's getting into her pants."" He's just horny. It's not love. If it ever turns into a relationship between the two of them, it will be based on lies, manipulation, and cheating on someone he claimed to have ""loved."" </P>
<P>My sister looked like she'd been crying and sat on the floor next to my mom just looking at me. My mom said she's taking me to a psychiatrist when we get back to Tucson (which means I'll be going soon) to get me a prescription to help with my depression. She said it's become ""too much"" and he doesn't care about my feelings enough to stop hurting me, so she won't let it go on untreated. </P>
<P>The rest of the week was okay, but I don't remember much of it because it's late and I was so focused on writing this long ass thing. If you read it all, good for you. Okay, that's all. </P>
<P>Bye.</P>"

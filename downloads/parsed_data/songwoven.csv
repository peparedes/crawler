"event","Matt Hickman asked me out on a date... of course I said yes! (HOT)
Jake asked me on a date. Of course, I stupidly said yes...
Alyks told me he liked me and had wanted to ask me out, but was transferring to a different college. (WTF?)
Jon mailed me a sweet care package with a DVD and handmade paper. And for some reason I told him we could go on dates... but why not? I mean honestly... we're practically a couple now... erm... in some ways...
Danny messaged me from Norway for about 15 minutes while in an Internet cafe.
Peggy's son is HOT...
I had a dream about JEREMY of all people last night.
Sean Peters is an amazing dancer and is foolish if he doesn't audition for West Side Story! 
Adam's auditioning, good for him. I don't know how good his (or my) chances are though. 
My daddy's the best.
My little brother is such a cutie! Girls are going to be all over him in a year or so...
I just mistakenly called Justin ""John"" oops. But he laughed, so okay."

"event","My head hurts like hell. 
My mind is all woozy... whoosh...
Wanna talk to Jon... 
Dan's on his way to Europe. 
Going out with Jake and Pete tonight... that'll be interesting, especially since Jacob and I still have a spark, and I KNOW he's still in love with me.
I don't know what I'm going to do there, mom says I should go ahead and casually date him. But how many guys will I be casually dating by next year! Good grief!!! 
I want my Jon, I already miss him :( Won't see him for at least a month and a half or so, who knows when I'll see Danny... how is it possibly to like so many guys at once? Am I normal? 
And AUGH... my HEAD! FUCKER!"

"event","The key seems wrong... like notes miswritten on the wrong sheet of music... somehow the harmony has faltered, been lost. 
Home is strange to me now (as is this infernal headache that won't FUCKING go away.) 
I am strange to me sometimes... I'm a foolish, foolish girl and I dont half deserve the things I receive. I don't know how to describe this year. It seems surreal sometimes... I can't believe it's over. I've come closer to accepting myself this year and yet it seems like I'm even more in hiding. 
Things with Danny are... stable? I don't honestly know why I stay with him... is there any real emotion on my end? I think so sometimes... and others, I just feel so incredibly ambivalent about him. It doesn't seem to much matter to me if I date him or not, and yet... his good opinion of me is somehow so important. I WANT him to think me perfect, wonderful, sweet, kind... I WANT him to believe I'm ""the one""... even though I'm fairly certain he's not MY one... 
And then Jon...
Dear, sweet, wonderful, beloved, faithful, kind, hopeless Jon...
I've put him through so much, and yet he still blindly, selflessly loves ME for exactly who I am. How lucky can a girl BE? Girls DREAM of guys like him... the ones who will worship you without putting you on a pedestal, the ones who would literally die for you... and yet, when I get the chance to be with that guy... I run! 
He said in his diaryland that maybe boyfriend/girlfriend isn't enough for what we are when we're together... maybe he is right... 
I know I'm scared of his love... I'm scared of its brightness, its beauty, its passion... its perfect surrender... maybe one day I will feel worthy and proud of that...
Sadly... I have to admit that my fleeing was originally for shallow purposes... he's right to be upset that I can be ""seen"" with Danny but never him... my poor Jon... I'm too much the material girl to have been happy with the sloppy, free-spirited, out of place person you were... and now that you're becoming this polished, charming and HOT guy... I can't reveal my shallowness by suddenly being willing to date you now that you're ""presentable"" (by MY standars... which mean NOTHING).
I don't know where to go from here. 
I just know that it took ten minutes here to realize that I want desperately to be back THERE in his arms..."

"event","Saw a thing on Jon's diaryland, a title without an entry... something about how so many things change and yet they stay the same.
This seems to strike me as particularly fitting at this point in my life... 2 years out of high school, two years into my college career. I'm so very in the middle, so very HERE and yet not somehow. Things seem so surreal sometimes. 
Why am I not like other people? 
Why am I not satisfied with what I am given? How is that possible? How can I NOT be happy with the things I have been given? And yet, I never seem satisfied. 
Where am I now? What has changed in these two years? 
I'm still an incurable flirt, still love boys far too much sometimes. But I'm more experienced now... 
I'm still bright, but A's are no longer the end-all and be-all of my scholastic life.
I still love theatre passionately.
I still sing.
I'm not into science any more, I'm not as influenced by a desire to be what others want me to be. 
I'm a little wilder, but a little calmer too. 
I've experienced heart ache, and I've dealt out some heart ache. I've lost touch with old friends, but made some new ones. Some amazing new ones...
I've learned what true love is, and I've ignored it. I've truly loved and been ignored.
I've experienced passion. I've had affairs. I've laughed, smiled, cried and screamed a thousand times it seems.
In short I have found little pieces of who I am, but I'm not sure how they fit together."

"event","Ok so most of you reading this (to the best of my knowledge) are aware of what happened Friday night. Well as if it happening that once wasn't bad enough. We had to go and do it again. I have felt like shit since about 6ish this morning when Nick got up and walked out! All I wanna do is cry. Bryce and myself have talked and agreed that last night went to far and the way we treated Nick was all sorts of fucked up. We have agreed that for the best we are not going to allow this to happen again. We will remain friends and hang out, I am determined to kick his ass in Halo at least once! I am just so glad he is on the same page as me, now the hard part is going to be getting Nick to forgive us. That is all I really want, even if I never see Bryce again! I want Nick back. I just wanna talk to him and tell him how I feel, and that sadly means I would probably fess up that I have liked him for months and it just killed me to watch him get up and walk out. I would tell him that I do like him that means I should have never allowed anything to happen with Bryce. My only defense being that Nick just needs to understand how much I don't like myself these days and how low my self esteem has been and to have a cute guy throw himself at me it is really hard to say no, and I know that it hurt Nick in the process but my heart has been aching for two days now over it."

"event","ok I don't even know where to begin...I am in a weird ass mood and all I wanna do is cry and tell people off. I just wanna start texting people and tell them how I really feel! And I know I shouldn't. I needed to talk so I texted one of the few people who I would still be up this time of night(Nick), only problem with that is that he is one of the people I would like to be honest with and kinda want to but don't want to at the same time. I want to tell him that I think he is hot and I like him and that I hate that he thinks my friend (that he doesn't even know) is hot...FUCK ME! I wanna fucking tell off Norm and tell him that they way he and his girlfriend treated me was all sorts of wrong and that I did not deserve it. That I am fucking glad he loves her and that is a damn good thing cuz neither of their fucking crazy asses would ever find anyone else to put of with their shit! Like I said they are both fucking crazy and I wanna tell Norm he might wanna learn to take grab of his own fucking balls and tell his girlfriend to fucking let go once in a while! Oh and then there is the fact that I recently found out that my first love is engaged to be married and his fucking girlfriend is fucking pregnant! I mean honestly are you shitting me? I bet I don't even fucking get invited to the wedding! And we used to talk about me wearing a tux and being in his line! Ha ha ha fuck that!
I am so fucking bored of my lazy ass bro and his nasty ass ways my house currently smell like someone ate something rancid puked it up and pissed in it! And when I tell him the house smells all he can fucking say is I know! I am about [  ] this close to cleaning up all my shit pack up some essentials and find someone to bum off of for a while and believe I can fucking find someone who will be willing to give up a couch! I hate living away from my mom! I miss her! I am glad that she is fucking happy but that makes only one of us! I am so not happy with my life! I am fat and only getting fatter! I work at a dead end job and I am having no luck finding a new fucking job that I will like, I used to fucking like my job and it has gone down the shitter since about thanksgiving! I want fucking out but I just can't bring myself to do it! I wanna take charge of my own life! I hate depending on others to fucking live...I am fucking 19 years old and with practically nothing to show for it! I have half-assed my entire life and I know it. That is not a fucking good feeling! I could just cry right now! This is not a good night for me to be alone I just realized...this is a dangerous time for me...I just don't what to fucking do and I haven't felt like shit runover twice in a long time and I do tonight! If you have read this far I am fucking amazed you stuck with it. I hope I did not make anyone uncomfortable with my swearing but is kinda how I feel...if you made it this far you fabulous and I love you for it. I think I will be done bitching now and no I don't feel any better so don't ask!"

"event","Alright so my last entry was vague and lame. Pretty much I made the decision that I wanted to clean up my life and that I was going to try and stop drinking and start going back to church. Ok well I have slowed down a LOT on the drinking but sad to say I have not put a complete stop to it. I have gone to church once and would also like to work on that one, but now that it is the new year I am not positive as to when it starts. I need to call someone and ask about that. 
I am also kinda surprised that I did not mention in my last entry the fact that my mother was getting married later that month, well she is married now and living in Orem. My house is a lonely one! and it is a damn good thing that my mom is my landlord or I would be living on the streets, in a a card board box. 
Ok so now that I got you caught up a little...
Today was a depressing day! OK so I have been depressed a lot of this week but today is kicking its ass. I don't know what to do with myself! I really just wanna pack up and move and quit my job and go start clean somewhere new. It is a good thing I am poor cuz I HONESTLY would probably do both of those things if it weren't for the money. I really would like a new Medical Assisting job, that is what I want to do but I really think a part of me is holding me back from really getting out and looking for a job because I fear that I am going to fail at it! I quit things before I can fail at them and I haven't decided what is worse, to quit or to fail? I really just wanna get my life together but I am not sure how I am going to do that."

I have many feelings going on right now and I am having a battle inside myself! I am not ready to talk about what it is yet, as much as I would love all of your input on the whole thing I think I just need to make this decision on my own and I know that it is going to be one of the hardest ones I ever make! I think I will lose some friends and some fun times but at the same time I know I will make new friends and I think I would be happier down the road...I just don't know!

Ok well on a completely different note I just got back from a 10 day vacation to Philly, PA. I stayed with some family out there. I won't lie to you, I was bored most of the time and wishing I were home but at the same time it was a nice break from the realities here at home. The reality of my home is not a happy one for me right now! It is hard for me to explain do to the fact that I am not sure I understand it all myself. 

Ok well I think I have rambled on sufficiently for today..."

But I always am, that and I have had permaheadache for like a month now and beginning to wonder if I should talk to my doctor about it. So yeah. My sad story of the day...ok so my mom has been on vacation with her boyfriend all week and I honestly have not noticed too much, that is how often I see my mom these days. I don't understand it, my mom and I are really close (I don't too many 18 year old girls who can honestly say that there mom knows all their shit...and I mean all) but I hardly notice that she is not around. Ok well now that I have shared my sadness with you I will be done updating for now. I wish you all a fabulous night."

"event","Ok so I am updating and not at work this time. You should all be proud of me! Ok so I finally think Logan is coming around...maybe. I just don't know! We were texting most of the night saturday and still didn't do anything (instead we spent the whole time trying to figure something out to do). So then I text him a couple of times Sunday with no response, so I am thinking I scared him off the night before. So I decide to just totally back off for a couple of days (but only a couple cuz we are going to the baseball game together on wednesday). So today was a half day for me at work, I got there at about noon, I ate lunch and had just sat down to start making call when I get a text. And what are the odds that it is from him? It says ""whats up doc"", so I am all happy that he text me first. His next text asked me when I got off of work (I am freakin happy now) so I ask him why, and his answer was not exactly what I was hoping for...basically he ran outta gas and was hoping for a ride. Oh man I was frustrated but because I wanted to see him I left work early to go and save his butt. It was ok I guess, we talked about stuff and things. He can't tell me that I can't find his house anymore. But even after I save his butt he didn't ask me to do anything tonight, and he knew I was doing nothing. I do know that I was the first person he asked to come save him, so he had to be thinking about me right? So what is your opinion? My grandma does not think that this is a good sign, but my mom does think it is a good thing. Logan is a shy, quiet guy and my mom thinks that I should be happy that is thought to ask me for help...I just don't know...any bright thoughts on the situation?"

Well I am at work right now and telling my co-worker of my downfall with Anthony...yeah well what can say we are an open office. Ok well I haven't had a good full nights sleep in like 3 night because I have severely burned boobs, I think it will be pretty hot when they peel. Sorry, I had to stop writing there for like 10 minutes and look busy, the doctor came back from her dentist appointment. She has gone home now, so now it is time to kill time. Ok well not a whole lotta time cuz we still have to do garbages...and we should be filing but oh well. Ok well I have decided that I need new pictures for myspace so it you have any cute (I said CUTE ones, Carisa) you should email them to me so that I can have them. Ok so this is going to be a pointless update but still an update. Ok I don't know what to write about, you all should give me a topic for my next update. That is it!!!!!You all should give me topics for my updates and then maybe I will update more cuz I will have something to talk about! Hahaha that is all of your homework so do it! Or you will all fail! Ok well it is now time to retrieve garbage so until next time I love you all! MUAH!"

Is that so wrong? I just have to keep telling myself that it is their loss (whether or not I believe it myself) and it only helps a little. 

Oh but better news...Anthony is moving out...they are signing the lease today (hopefully) and he will be out shortly enough. For those of you who know me could be curious as to why I am happy about this, or maybe not to. But I guess for those of you that keep up on my crush drama you could also see why I am happy, but I must say you are wrong!

"event","Ok so I was at HOSA (Health Occupation Students of America) Competition up in Layton this weekend, ok so thursday day to friday night. There was easily over a thousand students there and we were all staying in hotels up there for the one night. I was lame for the most part, but when we didn't have to be anywhere for our competition we were aloud to go anywhere we could walk to. So day one we went to opening ceremony strait off the bus (which was an hour of sitting there in our business attire not paying attention and clapping when everyone else did). So when that got done we all went and got our rooms, so me and my ""roommates"" for the night scored! we got a suite like our teachers and know one else did, our teachers didn't even know that we did until we told them. So we were probably the only room that didn't have to share beds (due to having a couch). So most of us had to go taken the written test portion of the competition at 4, so when we got done with that we all went out to dinner and walked to the mall. At the mall I bought blue fuzzy flip flops and my snotty/bitchy Juan Diego roommate told me if I bought them and wore them she would lock me out of the room, I bought them anyway and told her I would do what I wanted. We were going to go to a movie but the same girl decided we were going to have an O.C. party instead and all sit around in complete silence (unless she was talking) for an hour. My other roommate wouldn't shut up and she is one of the people that always has to ""1up"" your stories...hers is always worse. So at about midnight I put on my headphones and rolled over and went to sleep. So the next morning I get up and go down stairs for breakfast and eat all alone. I went back up stairs and showered and got all dressed up in my scrubs and lab coat and headed over to my personal competition. I didn't study at all so I was pretty sure I was fucked! So as everyone before me came out (I was last to go) they said it wasn't too bad but af course couldn't tell me what it was. So I went in, and the stuff I had to do was easy enough, a blood draw on a fake arm and a throat culture and agar plate, but of course I fuck things up cuz I have a judge breathing down my neck and everyone feels like an idiot talking to an arm, so I move on to the throat culture and agar plate where there is a different judge (I liked this guy better) so I did my thing and walked out. I was glad it was over and I had the next 3 hours to go do whatever the hell I want, which turned out to not be a whole lot. Went to closing ceremony and sat through everyones name that got 1st 2cd 3rd and then the top ten of every category. Well we finally made it to me and I tied for 5th out of 13 people, so I guess it could have been worse, especially without studying. So that was that, we got on the bus and went home. 
I must say if you have read all this shit you must have been hoping for something good or juicy well I am sorry to disappoint you either that or you are one bored fuck and for that I am also sorry.

"event","Ok so yeah basically about the kid I told you about in my last update stopped writing back, not sure why but I have a few thoughts in mind as to why...Oh well, so yeah I still have my couch dweller. So much for just one night, oh well I kinda just don't notice anymore. The only reason I have for wanting him to move out is that he got mad at me one night cause he was bored of hearing my ""feelings"" from everyone but me; so I was really tired and burst into tears and went down into my room and wrote him this long note (I do better with feelings in writing and not face to face)... he wrote me back the next day and said that once he moved out we could take a ""whack at it""...so that should be interesting, if he ever moves out. But he is again talking about me moving into an apartment with him (yes separate rooms). Ok so I know the kid means no harm but I feel I have a stalker coming on, I am just to nice to say ""BUZZ-OFF"", which is why I ended up on a date with him in the first place...feel free to ask...if you don't work at JC (or use to) it will mean nothing to you, but for those of you who have you will understand!

I was so excited. My mom told me that I couldn't message him because of the type of people he hangs out with now. Ha ha ha you know me, of course I messaged him! I told her and she just looked at me as to say ""what did I tell you"" ha ha ha oh well; she looks at me and says ""don't count on him writing back!"" Well guess what, he did. He has no idea who I am, oh well! So I thought I would mess with him a little more, and I didn't tell him who I was quite yet, I still wanna see if he can figure out on his own.

Ring 2: Some scary parts (damn you Logan) but overall LAME
Robots: It may be for kids but I liked it very much
The Phantom of the Opera: If you haven't seen this one yet you are in trouble with me
Wedding Date: it was ok, I kinda liked it
Work And The Glory: Haven't seen it yet but I will get there

Ok so that is all the movies we currently have at jordan commons...

"event","OK so that entry before work clearly never happened. So my good friend Liz just reminded me so here I am updating. I actually got back my score for that life changing test today and I passed...yay I am so proud of me I passed the easy test. OK so I don't think I mentioned that I got my hair done on Friday and it turned out way darker than expected...I kinda freaked and cried for an hour. Everyone tells me looks good and it is  ok now I think I might actually like it and I am considering keeping it like this for a while. 

OK in other news, I had a party for two of my friends moving away (tomorrow, I am going to miss them) and a b-day party for another friend. I was so much fun! Most of us got pretty damn drunk, my mom got more drunk than I did...he he he duh! So yeah we only had one guy pass out on the toilet (he could not walk on his own) and one kid threw up all over our front door it is nasty. Then there was my crush (why he is my crush is still a mystery)...oh my gosh he was so so drunk and could only kinda walk on his own. I spent most of the night babysitting his drunk ass or he would have raped somebody. He doesn't remember much of that night. For  being such a crazy/horny guy he can actually be quite gentle. He held my hand a lot, he would randomly kiss my hand, he would play with my hair and just kinda sit there next to me and lay his head on me. He would protect me from one of the other guys who was a dick to me last party, it was so cute. So when he left he kissed me, a real kiss this time and it was one of the best kisses I have had in a long time, it was so soft and gentle. To bad he didn't remember the next day, and I know he didn't remember because he asked me if he kissed me...I asked him if that would be a good thing or a bad thing, he said neither (ouch) so I told him that he had. So he clearly does not really like me that was just the alcohol talking all night! Oh well I have a feeling it is better this way. Ok so yeah this is a pretty lame update but anyway.

OH and for all of you who actually read this no one I work with is to know about this party so that no one gets into trouble...namely my mom. 

MUAH I love you all ~ Jen"

Tomorrow is going to be just as bad because tomorrow will involve listening to all the cute stories from the people who have someone. So I have a life changing test tomorrow and I just can't focus on studying! What is wrong with me? Ok so this is going to be a very short update...wanna know how short...this short!"

I am doing ok (kinda really gotta pee at this very moment)(sorry I am sure you just don't care) I am stressing over my state tests coming up this month for my medical assisting class, and the sad thing is that these stinking test could very well be life changing which scares the beegeegbees out of me! So yeah I am in my tech class right now and I should be doing homework but I suffer from boredom and not being able to concentrate (what is new...nothing!). So yeah I am having fun, my friend who is sitting on the computer next to me was bored so I told her that should become a faithful reader of my live journal so to her, Thank you Angie friend! So I am officially the only person in my class to not get blood during blood draws, how sad is that...it is sad. Well ok I am going to be done now, and I think I am going to go hit up the bathroom so I can be all better! Muah I love you all!

So yeah, in tech yesterday we started blood draws! My partner in it had really hard veins so I failed...my teach is still giving me full credit cuz I had really good technique. The girl doing it to me (I have shitty veins myself) and the first try she go0t nothing and they were fishing for a vein, however on her second try she was successful, we were all so proud. It hurt and I am not sure why but oh well what can ya do? It was funny she forgot to put the gauze by my arm before she pulled out the needle and this big drop of blood popped out and started running down my arm and my teach like yelled ""catch it!""...he he he I found it funny, and then I realized that I was feeling a little light headed. Ok so yeah I have no idea what all else to talk about so yeah I guess I will just be done for now! Muah!!! I love ya all to death!

"event","Hey everyone who actually reads this...so thursday night was my works MegaProm. I went with a good friend of mine, Anthony. He is a great guy, he is so sweet and he always has me laughing. ... . Ok yeah those dots are in place of a sentence I would love to have right there but it is one that just not anyone can read; think what you may but I promise you nothing dirty goes there. Anyway I got ready over at my friend karlie's house (this would make it easier for our dates to pick us up). We had fun getting ready and her told her dad that he should threaten them when they showed up (I don't have a dad to do it for me so at least one date I go on should be threatened by a man), but he didn't, it would have been funny. Her parents did give the guys a hard time before we came up the stairs though. So Karlie and I are all excited and we know our dates have surprises but we can not tell each other what they are...he he he. So we go up the stairs and turn the corner and there are our dates standing there all handsome and cute (my date rented a tux, and the vest and tie matched my dress). We go over to them and say our hellos and the guys pull out a dozen roses from behind their backs...it was sooo cute! I so excited, I had never received flower from a guy before! So Karlie's step-mom took pictures of us, ya know all that cheesy parent stuff. So we went out into the SNOW and got into the car and headed to work. We walk into work holding our roses and on the arm of our date, it was great. We walked around alittle and everyone commented on us, it was a little weird. So we went down to where the dancing was and signed up that we were there, and decided to go eat. Ok so we are all there in formal wear and they had messy finger foods! Please explain the logic behind that one... So after we got done eating we went and had our pics taken. I did the electric slide in heels, that was bad! So yeah we danced very little. The guys didn't really wanna be there (the music was lame). So we got in our one slow dance and decided it was time to head back to Ryan's (Karlie's date) house to watch movies and hang out. We got there and all changed into real clothing, we had to rip Karlie out of her dress cuz the zipper was stuck. So yeah we watched a couple of movies and ended up all falling asleep. I got home at about 4 in the morning..."

"event","First of all I would like to apologize to all of you who actually read this! 
So yeah my tongue is no longer swollen so I am not talking with a lisp anymore...let me tell ya that was fun at work...NOT! So not a whole lot has been going on, you know all the normal stuff: work, STRESS, school, STRESS, homework, STRESS, sleep, oh and did I mention STRESS! Yeah there was a possiblity of me getting kicked out of tech because of my grade well let me tell ya I doubted myself...it was a C last week, so yeah I got my final grade today and it was an A! Hell yeah! So yeah now I am just stressed over my English grade, can I just say that I do not understand Macbeth and having a HUGE final today on it that pretty much determines my grade scares me. I do not feel very confident with how I did on that final, I know I got one question right - Who wrote Macbeth? - I knew that one! My mommy told me if I got that one wrong she would have dis-owned me! Sad huh! 
Ok so I have a question for you all and I would love an opinion on it...the love of my life and myself are in this little battle of who is better looking Orlando Bloom or Brad Pitt? So yeah let me know who is better looking in your opinion and why...
Oh and in other new our works MegaProm is coming up (on thursday) and I am no longer going stag! The guy I wanted to ask actually asked me the other day...apparently his other two dates (yes two) didn't end up working out. So yeah I am excited! He is crazy and popular, he plans on going all out for this, meaning wearing a tux and most likely a top hat and cane! So yeah I will have to try and pics for you all to see. I just have one fear with going with him and that is because he is popular and a nut that I am going to get left behind in the shadows...hmmm oh well.
So this turned out to be a really really long entry, I had no idea that it would be this long and I must say that if you are still reading and you have made it this far you really need a life...just playing I love you all! MUAH!"

And before any of you ask yes it hurt, what the hell would you think when you push a bigass needle through a fleshy part of your body. It cost a lot of money and I sat there for two hours by myself cause the wait was that long...the guy right before me got his nipples done (ouch and you all thought I was stupid). So yeah that is my update for today, so if any of you have any questions just ask them...what can it hurt and I love reading the comments you all leave."

"event","Sorry it has been a couple of days...so yeah I am so afraid that I am going to get kicked out of the tech center. I know if I do get kicked out I will have no one to blame but myself, and that makes me sooo disappointed in myself. So yeah, Logan is still being a pinprick! MALES! I hate them and yet love them all at the same time. So they screened White Noise last night at work...it was scary at parts...but I never actually screamed. I am proud with how well I handled it, maybe I am not as big of a wimp as I think I am. The couple corner wanted me to sit with them but it just didn't feel right, that and it was very depressing...I told them no, thank goodness that I was already invited to sit with someone else so I didn't look completely lame! Yes and I named my blanket Fred and he is my protector (but possibly gay, he is pink in color). Ok yeah so I love you all, thanks for caring and reading!"

"event","Ok so yeah I hate em! Ok so last night at work I was giving a break (the Gem Hall if anyone cares) and my crush,Logan, started to walk by for his break but turned around when he saw me and spent his whole break at my podium talking/flirting with me (luckily it was pretty slow). So right after that it was my break so I walked him back up to box office where we stopped and talked again for a while, and he was doing ok with the flirting at this point (he does suck at flirting, but I was warned I can't say I wasn't). For the rest of the night he would give me little flirtatious looks everytime he saw me. So I was thinking there was a cause for hope...I think I thought too soon. I got off a little early so I thought I would invite him to a free list movie with me...I got two tickets and wrote on the back of his to come join me when he got off and passed it to him (how 5th grade). So I went to the movie and everytime I heard the door I would turn and look and guess what it was NEVER him, he didn't even come to tell me that he wasn't going to stay. WHY do I do this to myself? I am such a loser...anyway..."

"event","It is now the year 2005! Wow how time flies, it seems just last year that everyone was getting ready to party for the big 2000...So yeah my blind date was fun (all 17 hours of it). He took me to dinner and it was way tasty. His parents were out of town so we had to go let their little puppy out for a potty break, (oh my gosh that puppy was so cute) we hung out there and watched a movie, Dodge Ball, before heading over to my friend's house for a party. I could tell through the whole movie he wanted to hold my hand...but he was shy...so finally during the last 20 minutes or so of the movie he got the guts to hold my hand. After the movie was over and we were getting ready to leave for the party he pulled me in for a hug and then kissed me, so we kissed a few times and headed to the party. We got to the party right around 11:40 and he got to see me for who I was with my friends (drunk friends might I add). So at midnight he didn't dare kiss me cause my bro was in the room; and to be honest I was kinda glad he didn't (the guy I have a crush on was also in the room) it would have been awkward. Actually he did a whole lot of nothing while at their house. So when he was leaving he asked it I wanted to go with him and watch some more movies, so I did. I was debating on whether I should go with him where I was sure I was going to get action or if I wanted to wait for him to leave and jump on my crush and just hope for some action...I went with the for sure action. I will tell ya I think my date was slightly disappointed with the fact that I would not have sex with him cause he was expecting it...oh well too bad for him. So yeah I vote I never hear from him again...he didn't even tell me nice to meet ya, I had fun, or that he would call me so yeah I was obviously not the piece of ass he was hoping for. Yeah...but the high light of the night was all of us at the party going outside to see people's fireworks and getting into a HUGE snow ball fight, none of us were prepared for a snowball fight none of us had gloves or coats on...it was so cold but I haven't had that much fun in a long time. So yeah if anyone wants more details than what I just gave yeah just let me know and if you are lucky you might get them."

So today I had to work, it started slow but by the end of my shift it got way busy, which is too bad, I wanted to go home early my head felt so congested (it has since I woke up this morning) but oh well what can you do in the busy season and it wasn't that bad all things considering. So yeah I am going to hang out with some friends tonight that I haven't hung out with in forever! It should be interesting. So yeah tomorrow consists of: possibly shopping for clothes, shopping for a car, going on a blind date, and partying to bring in the new year. It should be a long but good day. I can't believe it is almost the year 2005...I graduate from high school in the year 2005! Crazy! Ok so yeah I think that is all the random stuff for today. I gotta go get ready to hang out."

So yeah I hate being lied to, I have trust issues as it is but why lie when it is over something simple that the truth would hurt less? Sorry people bother me lately. So yeah here I am sitting in my pj's at 1:ish in the afternoon with nothing better to do (unless you count homework as better) than sit on the computer and listen to rain hit the window and my dog snoring...I am so putting on some music...So anyway yeah, I have a day off of work today and it is great. I was going to go get my tongue pierced today but I am having barbell issues...ok and maybe being a bit of a whimp...well yeah maybe I can talk myself into going today, I work in the morning but nobody needs to understand what I am saying anyway."

I am going to get kicked out of the tech center if I don't get my big butt in work mode. To bad I enjoy hanging out and partying with my friends over doing my homework. That and I have been working alot! This pay period is going to be a pretty good one. I work 5 shifts this week and one of them I am getting paid time and a half :-)! and if I work new years day I get time and a half for that too. The money will be nice cuz my two paychecks this month weren't so hot. Well ya, so I need to go check on my laundry and get looking presentable before work tonight."

I went and got my paycheck (depressing, it was half of my last pay check) but I had a great time walking around and flirting with guys while distracting them from there jobs. It was great until my manager walked up behind and asked what I was doing...I told him that I was looking at movie times...not sure he believed me though. This isn't a good time to get into trouble anyway, it is time for evaluations. But evaluations = pay raise. I can't believe it is almost Christmas it just doesn't feel like it. I still need to wrap presents...hmmmmmm maybe I will go do that while I am home alone. Ok well I am off to wrap presents."

Two of the girls decided that it was our leader's ""birthday"" today just so she would get sang to, everyone played along it was fun.

They get to watch a cool movie, all I got to watch was A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickons... unless you count us watching Elf in my tech class against administrations rules (he he he it pays being in high school and having a kick ass teacher).

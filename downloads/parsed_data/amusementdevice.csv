<p>It started off alright. But then&#8230;<br />
I would like the last 8 hours back, please. Hello? Last 8 hours? Can I&#8230; Can I get those please? I know I invested them in something that I thought would generate products of happiness and enjoyment. But I can see that backfired and I&#8217;m left a little emotionally empty.</p>
<p>So, can I have them back? I suppose I can just go to the White House and ask for an emotional bailout for the bad entertainment choices I made. They&#8217;ll buy that, right? What if I tell them my ego is too big to fail?</p>"

Just exaggerated.  My vision has gotten a little worse.  Not enough for anyone (except me) to be concerned, but enough to warrant new lenses and frames.  I&#8217;ve never quite been happy with either pair I currently have.  Though I will save them as backup glasses.  Just in case.</p>
<p>My new ones mark the next evolution in custom glass wear.  And they have a bronze look to them.  I&#8217;m really excited.  Will post pictures in a week (when they arrive).</p>

"event","Yesterday was hard.

Strike that.

Sleeping during the day is hard.  Especially when the temperature is above 70 degrees.  And as I work third shift at a hotel, I sleep during the day.  This invariably means that I will only get about 4-6 hours of sleep... assuming I try and do so as soon as I get home.  This is because around 12-1, the general temperature begins to rise and everything is made damp with sweat.  The slightest noise from those I live with will jolt me out of bed.  And from there, my rest is complete.  Regardless of the time.

Yesterday was a little better.  I slept until 3.  6 hours.  Not bad.

I was invited to the shooting of a motion picture... as an extra... which sounded really exciting.  16mm film.  lights.  sets.  special fx and make-up.  but each set was taking a long time.  and after 5 hours of watching, they informed me that they were not going to get to the scene we (the extras) were in until the following day.  In the morning.  at 9:00 AM.

So.... my day went/goes as follows:
3:00pm - 5:30pm: prep for shoot, breakfast, brush teeth, sit in traffic
5:30pm - 10:30pm: Wait around on set.
11:00pm - 7:00am: work
7:00am - 9:00am: breakfast, busy, brush teeth, don't go to sleep
9:00am - 1:00pm: Wait around on set.  hopefully they will get to the scene I'm supposed to be in.
1:00pm - 2:00pm: Go home, brush teeth, go to bed (hopefully)

23 hour day.  I know I'm not getting paid for this.  And I've already incurred a parking ticket because I didn't read a sign.  Is this what life in Hollywood is like?  20 hour days.  Eating once... maybe twice.  working between shoots.  Delays and disaster.

I'm already tired.... and it's only halfway through my day.

And I miss my girlfriend.  I barely got a chance to talk to her today.  Text messages while waiting on set.  I miss her.  I love her.  I think I've heard her voice almost every day for the past... at least three months... every day.  to not hear her voice today really spun me around.  Don't like it.

I REALLY love her.  Things have been so incredible lately.  Even when the days are horrid, with her, we persevere.  She is absolutely amazing.  And I would do anything to be able to see her today.  But it's Thursday.  She doesn't work.  And I will be passed out (hopefully) from 2 until 9.

Here's hoping it goes by quickly.

"event","Starbucks might be the worst drip coffee in the world.
Which is terribly unfortunate, as I live in a place with a Starbucks on every other corner.  Until you get downtown.  Then they double up on every block.

Someone once told me that Dunkin Donuts had the best coffee ever.  I never wanted to trust it.

But my love of coffee might just send me into the open arms of another brewer.

I must leave this dirty trick named Starbucks.
For that matter, her disgusting cousins, Tully and Peet are really no better.


Someone please tell me:
Where in this dark roasted town can I get a good cup of black brew?"

<p>It&#8217;s a studio.  It&#8217;s small.  It&#8217;s not too expensive.  And it&#8217;s downtown.  Walking to work will keep me in shape.  But then again, so will the YMCA that is two blocks away from work.</p>
<p>After living a life that wasn&#8217;t really mine for so long, I finally feel like I&#8217;m back on track.  After almost a decade of self destruction and a year of recovery&#8230; I&#8217;m starting over.</p>
<p>It feels really weird to be 30 and have almost nothing to show for it.  At times I feel like an absolute failure.  At others, I look around at the faceless people who <em>hate</em> and fall and surround me and realize that I am still and more alive than ever before.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rough.  I feel alone a lot.  I have my core. My triforce of power.  And they each support me in their own way.  With love, adoration, creative release&#8230;</p>
<p>I feel low.  I&#8217;m at least a third of the way through my life&#8230; and it feels like I&#8217;m just getting started.  I&#8217;ve never done this before.  Only the one life.  And I have nothing to compare it to.  So I have no idea if I&#8217;m better off or worse than anyone else.  And I won&#8217;t ever know.</p>
<p>But restarting at 30&#8230; it&#8217;s scary.  How much of my life did I really lose?  How much can I get back?</p>"

3:36 am Monday April 13th, 2009</p>
<p>I could hear here snoring from around the corner.  I thought a guest might have left their room door open.  I was chuckling quietly to myself as I round the back hall of the 7th floor.</p>
<p>I could smell the bar before I saw her.  In that instant before sight, all I could think was some fat, smelly, drunk, homeless guy was asleep in the corner.  My hand slipped into my pocket to grasp my radio&#8230;. but I seemed to have forgotten it.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t need it, though.  Beside her bare feet were a pair of Nike running shoes.  She&#8217;d obviously used them for running.  They weren&#8217;t recovered.  They had a worn look, but not a discarded one.  Her blue jeans had no signs of wear.  No holes.  No faded white spots.  My jeans have been dirtier.  Not much&#8230; Her jacket had only seen a couple winters&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there were no holes.  Only slightly faded.  Only slightly worn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, wake up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her vibrant purple scarf was being used as the world&#8217;s most ineffective pillow.  Like how a paper plate would cushion a Honda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, are you a guest at the hotel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8221; She looked at me, then at her surroundings.  Her eyes were starting to focus.  The haziness behind them dissipating like mid day on the morning fog. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only been homeless a month&#8221;</p>
<p>I started to feel sick.  She looked like she could have been my grandmother.  Short, stylish white hair.  Thick glasses.  It wasn&#8217;t designer, but her hand bag didn&#8217;t look cheap.  She closed it and pulled it close to her, embarrassed.  She looked as though she were about to cry.  I really hoped she wouldn&#8217;t.  My throat closed and my stomach knotted.  Even if I wanted to throw up, it wouldn&#8217;t have gone anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not on drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know.  Did I say it?  I couldn&#8217;t tell.  I knew if I opened my mouth she would see the pain in my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t steal anything, you know?  That&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m here.&#8221;  Her voice was beginning to crack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that you did&#8221;  It was all I could say.  I wanted to say more.  But what?  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to ask you to leave the hotel&#8221;.  My eyes unfocused.  It was all I could do from letting my emotions tear me down.  But she was already putting on her shoes.  I didn&#8217;t have to say it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a bad shoulder&#8221; She could have been my aunt.  She wasn&#8217;t out of shape.  She was barely dirty.  She really looked as though she had been on the street for only a couple weeks.  The knot in my stomach tightened.  She was putting on her shoes with only one hand, and then trying to tighten them.  Should I help her?  Would that be mean?  Tying this 50 year old woman&#8217;s shoes for her.</p>
<p>I escorted her to the elevator.  Out the lobby.  SAY SOMETHING! Help Her, Moron.  I became distracted by the news man in the lobby.  She was in front of me now.  I pushed the button for the door, it opened for her.  She used her opposite arm to brace the door so that it wouldn&#8217;t close on her shoulder.</p>
<p>My stomach turned.  I looked down.  When I glanced back up she was gone.</p>
<p>That is the face of the homeless today.</p>

I don't know if you are one of those people, but I find it very rude when 

a) you are standing with a few of your friends, Bob1, and Bob2. Bob1 turns to Bob2 and says, ""hey, want to come over this weekend and sleep over?"" You are standing there wondering if Bob1 will ask you too, but they don't. Bob2 replies, ""ok, sure, and we can go out to lunch too!"" You think, ""gee, thanks for inviting me."" 
b) you are standing with Bob3 and Bob4, your other friends. Bob3 looks at Bob4 and says, ""wasn't it so fun this weekend when we went to Six flags?"" (and this has happened to me before) Again you think, ""gee thanks for inviting me!""

So, in conclusion, if you are one of my friends, NEVER DO THIS TO ME PLEASE BECAUSE IT MAKES ME EXTREMELY MAD. But my point is that on LJs, people feel like they should put their whole life on them, so you find out that your friend had a sleepover with one of your other good friends and then went to a concert with them. Or that someone had a party and didn't invite you.
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with doing something without one of your other friends, if you want to spend time with each other. But just don't put it on your LJ and announce it to the whole world. That is just rude to anyone who reads it."

"event","Okay, this is going to be a long entry. Or maybe I will do it as a bunch of separate entries. Here we go...

Reason 1: THEY ARE A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

                    Why? 

          Because I bet a million people spend half their lives online up dating their livejournal. Think about it! How much time do YOU spend at the computer on your livejournal? How much time do you spend reading other peoples'livejournals? And what is the point anyway? If anyone can think of a really good reason to spend half their life with their livejournal, let me know. Why would you do that? Is your livejournal your ony friend? Do you feel spiritually connected to it? Do you feel obligated to up date it? Do you feel like you should read your friends' livejournals? WHY? If your friends have something to say to you, they will TELL you. Because they are your friends. If you feel like you should read your friends' livejournals. STOP. STOP NOW. If your friends are too afraid or lazy to say something to your face, then you shouldn't be friends with these people. 

          The only reason I can think of for a livejournal is if you have a friend across the country. This way, you could leave each other messages on a joint livejournal account. It would be like sending letters, but would get to each other instantly. Also, that way, you don't have to wait for the other person to sign on AIM or something.

          Anyway, back to the waste of time. Yes. It takes long er to type something than to say it. Call your friend and tell them a funny story. Don't write the whole thing up on a livejournal for them. Take what I am doing right now. Do you even know how much of a waste of time this is? I should be working on my history essay or studying for my test, but I am writing a LJ entry. How dumb! :-) I think I will continue later! Goodbye."

"event","Well, it is Ash Wednesday, and I am supposed to be fasting. You know, I WAS. But then, I got a headache, and there is one thing for sure and that is that I do NOT want to get or even feel sick. So I made some graham crackers with peanut butter and chocolate chips, a good filling snack. I tell my mother I am thinking of Jesus in my heart. She says, ""You know, you could have at least sacrificed the chocolate chips.""
Oops."

"event","When you leave, he walks you down the stairs and sees you out the door. He says bye to you, and says he will see you soon. Then he thanks you for coming, and watches you as you climb into the car. His hands are poised on the door, itching to close it, but he remains standing in the door way, stares at you as you put on your seatbelt. He looks at his toes, avoiding your eyes, listens as the motor starts up, and waits for you to edge out of the driveway. As soon as you are on the street, he closes the door. Then he locks it, walks back up the stairs, and forgets about you. Until next time."

"event","Yes, honors chem people - I admire you very much for being so smart and spending a lot of time on the project and sacrificing all this stress. No, I am not an honors chem person. But, I sympathize with you. All I can say is:

1)Think of how relieved you'll be once this is all over. Think of how happy you will be when you pass it in, and you will be FREE of the stress. And think of what accomplishment you made, and what you contributed to human society! Just think! Maybe you'll feel a little better.
2)You're brave
3)You're smart
BUT...
4)I'm glad I am not you :-)"

Well, basically, I SHOULD be doing math homework, but I'm not. That is how it always is, I find. Tomorrow I will probably find myself with way too much to do and then get mad and annoyed at myself that I didn't do it today. Then my mom will get mad too. Then yell. Then come and say sorry. Then lecture me. (""I'm sorry, but..."") Yep. That is how it always is.

Well, to conclude, maybe I should do my homework as it seems I won't be going to bed earlier than 10:00. I am already getting pissed at myself for procrastinating. Who invented that anyway? I hate that person!"

"event","Well, I WAS going to go to Laura's nhouse for the Superbowl, due to lack of a TV in my house. But, my annoying mother decided that I couldn't because I didn't do my CHORES or practice my french horn. So, I could either stay home or go to someone else's house where there wouldn't be anyone I knew and basically I would sit and do homework. So I decided it was either Laura's or nothing. Then my mother was encouraging me to go with the rest of my family to this other person's house, even though she wouldn't let me go to Laura's. I don't get it because either way I wouldn't be doing my chores, oh, and I also practiced before they even left! 
And now I'm really bored because there is nobody to talk to and nothing to do, and I am really annoyed at my mom. Plus, everybody is watching the game (and I am not a sports fanatic, but I would rather be having fun and watching it for the commercials or something than be here. alone. with no one to talk to. and nothing to do except chores.)"

Whatever. So how is everybody's life?
Too much math homework, that pisses me off. NINE proofs in one night. sooo annoying. I hate math, but wait! According to my mom, ""I have a special talent for mth AND english that most people don't have. You are so lucky!"" BS. A 51 really is talented. My sister is the talented one. Have to stop, love to all, thanks for reading!

Anyway, I am really happy besides that fact that tomorrow is Wednesday, the WROST day ever, but I guess as long as I make it through math and long block band I will survive, because I am watching movies in two of my classes anyway. Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Yay history Mr. MURPHY!!!!!!!) and Carol's journey, weird move, but in the lecture hall so I can fall asleep! Mar har. 
Well, I should go to do damned math."

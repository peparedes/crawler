My New Best Friend
Retold by Kimberly Kirberger

Today I met a great new friend
Who knew me right away
It was funny how she understood
All I had to say

She listened to my problems
She listened to my dreams
We talked about love and life
She'd been there, too, it seems

I never once felt judged by her
She knew just how I felt
She seemed to just accept me
And all the problems I'd been dealt

She didn't interrupt me 
Or need to have her say
She just listened very patiently
And didn't go away

I wanted her to understand
How much this meant to me
But as I went to hug her
Something startled me

I put my arms in front of me
And went to pull her nearer
And realized how my new best friend
Was nothing but a mirror."

"event","i just put my hair up to start this entry, it's like i'm getting down to business and what not. 

i think this whole college dilemia came to a head tonight. i really have tried to make this all better, because i can't handle unsolved problems, i want everyone to be happy and to have this great old compromised solution. well, that never becomes a reality for me. i'm biting my lips, i guess i really am worried about this. 

how can you honestly go from being, like, best friends, to suddenly not knowing the person, and not even knowing where to begin when it comes down to leaving a voicemail for the other person. it's gotten to the point where i don't know which, if any, is the better option. i could try to work back to being friends, let the bygones be bygones, and so on and so on, and try to work at this thing called ""friendship."" i could also just leave it. and right now, i just want to pick leave it. i am content with what i have now, in parts, and i know that if i try to go back, and salvive what we had, i'll only be let down in the end. 

and i can't quite tell what i hate worse. do i hate the fact that the friendship we had was so superfical, and artifical to the point that where it hit a bump, we couldn't get back on track? or do i hate the fact that i would have rather dealt with that, and sometime, once i was ready, move on from in.

and this all ties into the fact that in a mere few months, i will be living with her. and i have enough stress with the fact that i won't have mine own space, and my own room, and just things that are mine. like my own shower, and stuff, it'll take serious time to get used to that. i know that people probably don't believe me, but i do like to do things on my own. like, sit and my bed and just think, and just sit, sometimes. and that just sitting is going to be interrupted, and almost non-existant. and that scares me. and then i am going to add onto that living with someone that doesn't speak to me, and is simply to busy most of the time. and that also scares me, because i don't want to become super-depressed, and end up moving back home, the last place in the world i would ever want to be. people tell me that i should just cancel the roomate thing, but i can't explain it, but i simply can't.

i guess i'll just sit around, hang in here for another couple of months. i'll wait to august, see how the summer goes, and wait and see what happens. i'll pray for the best, but also set myself up for the worst. 

i'm just hoping that somehow bed, bath and beyond and target and the rush of college preping can bring some part of this back together. time wil tell."

"event","today went better. and everything is slowy sifting back into the way everything always is. and, for now, i am content with that. and i talked to cameron last night, after this whole ordeal, and honestly i really think he could have said anything, and it would have been okay. thank you, cam, because i'm not sure what exactly i would have done without you last night, honestly.
on much happier notes, now, i fully enjoyed my math homework. yes, i said enjoyed in the same sentence as math, but honestly. i understood it all, and it made sense, and i was allowed to use my calculator, it was amazing and shocking. 
and tomorrow it's back to the whole tennis practicing, which i am semi-looking forward too. we'll see how i feel afterwards.
so blair and cam and bill and i went to the premiere of ""white noise"" tonight. and i'm so not a scary movie person, at all. and i almost broke cam's bones in his hands, but he's okay now. and the whole rest of the while i was with them, they were constantly scaring me, and i was simply just scaring myself. i never did the whole halloween-scary-movie sceen as a child, and i sure as hell don't do it now either. my lindsay lohan cd even scared me in the car on the way home. yeah, that's how nerdy-scared i can get.
bed time, i supposs. it would be the ""good"" thing to do."

"event","it seriously comes out of nowhere. i can be so content, so happy. one moment. and then, suddenly, with the next word, or phrase, it all blacks out, and i get upset. 
it has happened twice tonight. and that's why i'm writing it down, because maybe this way i can juts write until the feelings simply go away, or the simply get to the point where i am content with them.
i think it all started this morning, and like, i had a good day and all. but this was in the back of my head the whole day, a constant memory, flooding back at random times during the day. it was so spartic, one moment fine, next moment i'm overcome with memories and emotions that i haven't really thought about it months, in a few years.
i remember the day so well, it's like it was yesterday, i can replay it so clearly in my head. but instead, it was seven years ago, i was only ten years old. and now i'm seventeen, and no matter how much i tell myself that everything is okay, and that i am over this all, i am really not, and i'm sure that this will follow me for a long time. 
when i was young, i loved being home by myself. it was the only time that  i got to be by myself. i would mainly get just sit around and read and watch mtv(which for me was racy at the age of ten). january is a cold month, and i've never really handled the cold very well. i just remember sitting in my family room, watching tv, and just sititng there. my dad and sister were at her soccer practice, and usually i would go with them. i didn't go that day, and i can't remember why, but i figure it had to be that it was too cold outside for me to sit and watch them. so i stayed home, and waited for my mom to come home from work. she comes home, normally, at like 4 or so. she came home, walked in quietly, and was extremely quiet. the rest, i guess you could say, is history. breast cancer. 
i think the reason it hit be so hard today is that it has been seven years. she is considered a ""survivor,"" but i don't really consider her a survivor. because it is still with her everyday, and it will never go away. another thing, she wasn't suppossed to make it to my graduation. and that is the part that really gets to be. like, what if she wasn't here, my senior year, and i had to do it all by myself? i don't think that i could have really handled that. 
and as i think about it, and sick taste fills my mouth, and i have brushed my teeth like 5 times tonight, to try to get it to go away. it's this metallic taste, one that makes me sick, and one that leaves my mouth dry. and as i sit here, with all this, i still can't get over everything. i have tried so hard, for so long, and regardless, it doesn't go away. 
and i re-read the journal that my mom, sister, and i keep while she was going through her chemo, and i completely lost it. in my little ten-year old handwriting, i tried to describe how i felt, and so did meg, and my mom just wrote about what she looked like, and what she felt like. i don't pity myself, not at all. i think i am just scared to death that one day i will be told the same horrible news that she was told seven years ago, and i'm not sure that i would be strong enough to fight it. and that will haunt me until i know i am safe. you know that fallout boy song, i don't know the title off the top of my head, but the lyrics are ""take this to your grave, and i'll take it to mine."" well, i have a feeling i will be taking this to my grave, one way or another.
considering that it's me, i guess i should try to look for some bright side to this all, and the only thing i can come up with is that she has been alive for seven more years, and she beat it. it's left her raw, and haunted, but i guess i should be thankful that some parts of her are still with me, with my family. 
i guess only time will tell, and that this will all go away in a few days, and the shock-period will be over, and i'll go back to living my everyday standard life, as best as i can. everyday is a new day, and i should take it one day at a time, but that day seems to live on with me forever...i'm just waiting for a new one to surface.
so there's my first big entry, because i needed to get it out, and just basically talk to myself, and that's what this typing has let me do. and i'm glad that i did, because now at least i got it out, and i am going to talk later, but i needed to get this out with myself first. this is the first time i keep what i was feeling to myself for a while first before needing to talk to someone, because i need to know where i stand on this all.
and i tried to call you. and i wanted to talk to you, but i couldn't, because you where with other people. and i know, hands down, that if i told you that i was having a mini-breakdown, that you would have stopped and talk to me. but i am so happy with everything that i just didn't want to bother you. stupid, huh? i guess i just felt alone tonight, and i haven't let myself feel that way in a while. and i missed your voice on the phone, and i wanted to tel you this all. but i decided i would spare you listening to me, and let you read it. because it will take half the time to read it then to listen to me tell you all of it. and then, you were with her. and i don't care about her anymore. but still, at that very moment, and with everything in my head, i just got a little upset. and i know that everything there is done, and i don't give anything about that all. i really am over that, and i think you know that. the only reason it flared tonight was that when i ""needed"" you, you were with her. and that's why i am glad i wrote this all down. just read this, and know that i still want to talk to you. and know that i am not the slightest bit upset with you...i'm just a little emotional right now. i seriously need a big hug.
well, tomorrow i get back to my busy-body life. YAC planning committee, just what i sincerly need, and tennis. more things to fill the void that the cancer has created. i like to get away from it all. and tomorrow, it will start to dissapear..and slowly but surely get better. but i just thought i would let you know."

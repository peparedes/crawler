"event","Bluebeard's home grooming tip for the day:

Don't try to shave your own head with electric clippers without a good mirror setup to see the back of your head. I just did, and I bet it looks like a dog chewed on the back of my head. I cant even wear a hat to hide it or anything, because i went and fucked up the bottom part. luckily my lady will swing by for lunch and fix my head so i can leave the house without being apprehended by the god damn idiot police.

I havent worked this week yet, which sucks. The school districts down here don't look at subbing as a full time profession, i guess. So i may end up with some garbage retail situation to make good hours this holiday season. this is not what i want to do, but it is what i have to do to pay the bills. sad. i thought for sure i was done with jobs like that. Its shitty having a job that you are good at, satisfied with, and genuinly enjoy just sort of dry up. 

The director of the camp i have worked at the last few years took a new job being a camp director at a camp for special needs children in texas. however, unlike most summer camps, this camp runs YEAR ROUND. that would be the bet job for me in the world. full time summer camp? i can't even imagine it. but, texas. hmmmmm. to be honest, a full time camp job would be enough to get me to move to goddamn texas. there is no offical job offer, but he and i have discussed it, and he told me that he needs to scope out the new camp first, to see who stays and who goes. but that isn't really even an option till next fall anyway. 

I made crab rangoons the other night as part of a dim sum meal. instead of making the usual rangoon of wonton skin wrapped around some stuff, i put the stuff in a dish, and fried the wonton skins into litte chips. it was a deconstructed rangoon, and it was great. i used a lot less oil (though since the skins were still fired, it wasn't any healthier) and i saved the trouble of setting up a deep fryer. also on the dim sum menu for the night were spicy lettuce wraps, egg drop soup, thai peanut chicken, and little chicken vindaloo bites. 

on to indian dish names. I dont know what to call my inidan food. i improvise a lot of sauces on my meat, and i'm not sure what to call it. chicken masala? chicken curry? for this one i'm going with vindaloo, because it's pretty hot. some are easy, saag aloo has spinach and potatos, and biryani has rice and veggies in it. its the meat dishes i struggle with naming. 

also, my dal still sucks. i'm sure i could use a pre packaged spice mix, but i'd really like to get the flavor that i like from scratch."

On the upside, my full work day is over at 1:30, so i can come home and play the new katamari all afternoon. I've never taught highschool before, and I bet it will be easier than junior high, because these kids will have had a few years to deal with thier hormones, and come to terms with them. Also, being a young man when all the other subs seem to be old women may help my cause too. And the two ponies I will be standing on when I ride into the algebra room today will dazzle them with all thier sequins.

Last night involved an indian feast, chicken masala, basil fried rice, and tomato dal. Amy said she loved the dal, but i cant get over this one taste that's in it, that's been in it evey time I make dal. I need to hide out in an indian restaurant, because there is some crucial flavor element i am missing. HOWEVER, the chicken and the rice were top notch, in no need of reform or tweaking."

"event","3:05, just got back from campgrounds. There was a hole in the tent, or somesuch, and the tent was filled with at least an inch of standing water. Not yet knowing about the water, I stood up to pee, and exactly when i got all the way up, a lightning bolt hit so close to me that it couldnt have been more than 50 yards away. It was blindingly bright, and my ears rang afterwords. It was the closest i have ever been to a lightning strike, especially considering i was outside. It was jarringly loud, and woke the whole tent up instantly. It was at this point that we noticed that standing water. which had soaked the sleeping bags, the bags with out stuff in it, and all the clothing we had removed before geting into bed.

my pants were wet, so i had to strike the campsite in my underpants. I had on two hats to copmensate for the temperature; it was mildly effective. In case you hadn't assumed as such, i was drunk as a bastrard throughout this whole sordid tale. I am currently both drunk, and hungover. It is an inadvisable condition to be in. 

On a positive note, my campfire dinner was excellent. lemon basil fish, and saag aloo."

"event","I find that white wine vinegar and soy sauce have an interesting relationship. Both are quite unpleaseant by themselves, but when used in conjunction with other foodstuffs become quite managable. And together, they sort of cancel out each other's nasty flavor elements. I find that they are best used together as a base for a simple sauce, or a marinade as i find my self using it for more often. 

Last night's meal was made in abscense of honey. In the past i have used soy/WWvinegar as a base for a honey mustard sauce, and it turned out quite well. Actually it was the best when instead of using a corn meal or bread crumb base for cooking the fish, i combined the honey mustard with a coating of finely crushed walnuts. mmmmm.....

Either way, I had no honey. my thoughts lately (aside from spine crushing boredom, fears of a repo man, and passionate soul fire hatred for the fucking crooks we have in the federal government) have been that if i cant rig a good recipe from the seasoning stock i have on hand, then what the hell sort of cook am I? So i substituted a healthy dose of spicy goodness into the coating, changing it from a honey mustard marinade to a spicy mustard marinade. It turned out rather well, though i admit next time i would have marinated it stronger, and longer for a more prevalent mustard flavor to be a counterpoint to the heat. 

Had i the properly stocked pantry, i would have made my favorate side dish for spicy whitefish, a spinach nut dish with no suitable name. Sautee garlic and crushed nuts in olive oil for a bit, then add a healthy dose of spinach leaves. Once wilted, add a good sized chunk of feta cheese and heat it until half of it has melted, and half of it remains in chunks. Eat it while its hot, becasue it doesn't cool off well."

"event","Something today has me slightly unsettled. Not unsettled as in I ran over someones dog and drove away, but less than that. I guess much less than that. today i am unsettled about commercial items, and my involvement with them. 

When i think about corporations, whether or not they are consumer operations or not, i get very bad thoughts in my head. And rightly so as rampant capitalism will lead to the dollar being the only thing with any value at all. No morals, no good deeds, no caring for those less fortunate. Money. Money money money. Some would argue we very clearly live in a society of that nature already; if not it seems that it will certainly be in our future if no control is checked over big business. 

And thus todays quandry. I am having an internal conflict over my recent aquisition of the new <a href=""http://www.homemadesimple.com/swiffer/usenglish/products/flick.shtml"">swiffer carpet product</a>. I saw a commercial for this product, and it was purchased for me after a conversation with someone in my life who has money to spend. I certainly cannot afford things, and the purchasing thereof. I dont have a vacuum, and my carpets were getting a litte funky - this seemed like a wonderful poorboy solution. 

I like it, it works well, it does exactly what it seems it should. But i feel sort of dirty for having a brand preference. I have used thier products before, and have always been pleased with the results. I do enjoy a clean public area. I don't enjoy taking part in this process, being properly targeted by marketing gurus, advert hours and so forth. It would be better if things were a bit more quaint, where I could enjoy the purchase and use of a product without feeling like i've taken part in some sort of dirty american ritual. I need to be able to dance on the fringes of this filthy americanism without plunging headfist into the abyss, stumbling out, dazed, mubling about sam's club and the bachelor. 

The other prong of my forked troubles is my aging, and feelings of domestication. Having my own apartment gives me the sole responsibility of its care and upkeep. My room can be cluttered, but I do enjoy keeping relativley clean public quarters. And so I need to trouble myself with cleaning devices, and things of that nature. I was going to say something about oooh, what if my younger self saw me, blah blah yak. But then I thought, who gives a dick what my younger self thought? My various younger selves did and said lots of stupid things. Fuck them. I will go ahead and confotably enjoy a new cleaning product. Yet still, I feel older and more settled each time something like this happens. The truth is, I am older, and I am more settled. Keeping young is a mental game. More on age later."

But i asked them if they would consider hiring me next year, and they said - and i quote - ""hell yes"". The job is teaching in a specialized school for these kids alone, either as a full time teacher, or as TA. If you dont know, teaching assistants make dick-all for pay. 18k a year, and your on the top of the TA heap. They offered me 30 a year with full benefits for a TA position. And that's not even considering a full time position, which i could have in the city of chicago with my current sub teaching certification.

Long story short, i may on a one year sabbatical from chicago living. Cause thats a pretty good offer to me. I like the orginazation, I like the kids, and i'm pooping my pants with excitement at the possibility of not being poor.

"event","ok, i look at porn, no shame in that. not obsessivley or anything, but on a more than a weekly basis, lets say. as of late i've been noticing this one video floating around - or rather a type of video, i assume all made by the same group. there always 5 or 6 videos that run the same story. 1- girl shows up for date. 2 - girl says ""why don't we just fuck instead. 3-5 various acts of fucking. 6. girl lets out big obvious orgasm hoot, then gets right up and says ""i have to go"". guy says ""wait, can i finish?"" and girl laughs, leaving. 

now. i can understand the idea of being physically humiliated during sex, or peed on, or beaten about the head with a ball peen hammer, or whatever else might get your rocks off. these are not ideas I myself wish to take part in, but i can at least concieve of someone somewhere liking them enough to masturbate to. but the idea of an unfufilling sexual encounter? its such a buzzkill, why would you want to crack one off to this? It's on what i believe to be a male forum for dirty picture and movies - what i believe most if not all image oriented porn sites to be. now, if it were aimed towards women, i could see it being pleasing in a dominating revenge sex kind of way (and that very well be what is the case here).

but it exists, and i have seen it for a few weeks in a few different places - so i feel that it must cater to some man somehwere. Which leaves me with this conclusion - no matter how unfufilling or non-sexual it seems to me, if it exists, someone wants to masturbate to it."

more importantly - as the outdoor nature specialist i get to be in charge of the camp animals. so this means i get to pick any animal pet i want for the summer. within reaosn. it has to be something that can be gotten in the area, and it cant be too expensive. also, i would like a beast that isnt too hard to take care of. so i might get a pig. i think having a pig on a leash would be really cool, and it would make the summer much more interesting. also, i think i a wingless duck may be cool. a duck on a leash? it would rule.

the school i work for today sucks ass, becasue they start at 7:45, as opposed to 9. if i was a kid and i found out my school started that fucking early and it didn't have to, well, i'd probably be a mad little kid. and its not like it gets out early or anything oh no no no - it gets out a half hour later than some of the other grade schools. 

but, 615...and you're all ready - you must have been up since 5:30. 

oh well, why yes I have been. in having to set my alarm clock ealier than the 7 hour (to which it never leaves due to every other schools start time in the district) i ended up changing my real clock forward an hour, which you all know will magically wake me up at a real time of 525. so at 525 -thinking it was 625- i got up, showered, drank lots of coffe, and got into the car (and drove for 5 minutes). this is when i realized there was a time discrepancy. the car clock said 6. if i woke up at 630, how the fuck was it 6 right now? my first thought was - the time changed. and no one told me. and someone changed my car without my knowledge. this idea was quickly discarded. and then i wordered - have i been looking at the wrong time for months, and never noticed it? i mean, i guess i am a space cadet sometimes, but that seems extreme. so i check my phone. 6. god damnit.

this is just another in the string of things that fuck with my waking routine that are ultimitly my fault. did i change my clock like a doofus without realizing that it was an hour later than i thought it was? yes. would i like to try to blame this on someone other than myself? it sure would be nice not to have to take the blame. so now i get to sit around for an hour and wait while my clocks re-align themselves, and it becomes time for me to go to work. for real.

but, the real story here is this: today on the way to work i saw one of the coolest things so far this year. maybe ever. i was driving north on des plains, past the giant, mega giant cemetary that takes up almost all of north riverside. on the sidewalk to the right of the road, right next to the cemetary fence, there was a beat up old blue toyota with its flashers on slowly driving on the sidewalk. well, the grass and the sidewalk, as sidewalks aren't made for automotive travel. 

as i drove by i looked into the car, wondering who it was. maybe it was a cemetary curator, looking for something, or a lost member of a funeral procession. no -  it was a guy wearing a skull cap, but pulled up off his head, so it was just sort of resting on the top of his big ol' gourd. he was kinda ratty lookin , with an unkept beard and such, but the real treat was this: he had an eye patch, and was smoking a big cigar. due to his actions, my immedeate assumption was that this was in fact a giant blunt. why else would you drive slowly down the sidewalk with your blinkers on? he didnt look worried or anything - he looked like this was something he was very comfortable with, and did all the time. 

was this a weed pirate? a vengeful grave robber? that big guy from cypress hill?

it will be shrouded in mystery forever."

  and in the good news, i called apple today and as it turns out my computer was fixed for free, and the hard drive wasn't damaged in the least. and since apple wants me as a return customer (unlike jacobs twin honda) they didnt charge me the 50 dollar data transfer fee - no data had to be transferred. oh, they could have assesed the fee. without a doubt they could have walked with my 50, and i couldnt have said a damn thing. this here, this is the difference between good and bad business. one may make you more money in the short term, but you will never ever have a loyal customer base if you treat them like shit. 

if any large charitable organizations would like to sponsor my life, donations will be accepted cash or check. thank you."

"event","i have work. lots of work, all week kind of work. which is a welcme suprise - i was thinking i would have to wait it out. i didnt. it was awesome. i just got a call for work this coming monday at julian junior high school. percy julian junior high school. percy fucking julian. what a stupid name for a junior high, really sissified sounding. well, friday at julian was fine, but it was because i had a student teacher do al the work for me. that happens from time to time apparently. theres a student teacher, and she does all the work. and i do what? sit. and doodle. occasionally telling a kid to be quiet and pointing silently at thier desk, which i would assume has home(school?)work on it. sometimes it doesnt and i just point anyway. they look down, then back at me. when they do that, i open my eyes wider, and look all serious, and just point harder. that gets em every time. 

i find the grade school work much more relaxing. 4th grade seems to be the best blend of intellegence and independance age grants you, but very very few hormones to make everyone a big sucko. maybe i'll restrict myself to grade schools and just take on a third district. who knows.

 i had a class of fourth graders go ape shit over me, and they would yell things like ""your the best teacher ever!"" right to my face - i guess they liked me. they said the same thing to thier teacher, and to the principal. ""hire him as a fifth grade teacher! DO IT!"" they yelled as i took them through the hallway. i didnt tell them to say it or anything, they just thought i was cool. i'm not taking the job lightly or anything, dont get me wrong - i take it about 89 percent seriously. i get all the work done, i punish kids who are asswipes, but at the same time, if someone says something genuinly funny, i wont stay all serious. well, for those of you who know me, i pretty much act like myself having a good time in the classroom. not good time party animal WOOO kick over a chair or anything, just having a good time. some of the grade school teachers are really angry all the time, and do a lot of yelling. which may be good for the kids in some sort of kids love structure and punishment sort of way - but kids like to laugh and have a good time while they learn every now and again too. 

i roped my dad into going shopping with me, to the one and only store in the universe that can fit me for pants - rochester big and tall. it was rad, i got three pairs of black pants. i got way nice, slightly less nice, and dockers made of teflon. those are gonna come in handy for some of the rowdier little kid classes. you never know when a 6 year old is gonna have too much fun at gym and throw up on your pants. at least, thats what FDR always said. 

hopefully ill be moving to lyons township (BAH BAH BAAAAH!!!) soon. maybe not next week, but the week after that. having a bedroom again will be nice. the floor is getting more comfortable every night, but that cat isnt sleeping any more. and now that it knows we are play pals, he wants to jump on my face at 5:03 am, and paw at my beard. its ok, that one of my few complaints. 

if the biggest problem you have involves kittens, according to my book at least - your life is smooth sailing."

"event","well, the waiting portion of work is finally over, as the lyons township and oak park school districts called me this week and told me that they wanted to put me on the sub list. which means that as soon as i have a TB test done, and my criminal background check goes through - they can call me any time of day or night to request my services. i assume in the beginning there will not be many days of work, as they don't who i am yet, and there's only the two districts - but eventually i will be geting regular work. now i really have to start altering my sleep schedule. i need to be up by 6 every morning to recieve calls. i think it would be a good idea just to be up at 6 to get myself in a steady pattern. i wouldn't want to get up at 1230 one day and 530 the next - it throws me off.

Im looking for jobs and such, ive been certified to teach as a substitute teacher in suburban cook county, a startling amount of responsibility to bestow on my head. MY head! im nervous about this, not because i have to start soon, or that im afraid of children or anything - but because i don't think they're going to give me any sort of training or prep, except on a day to day basis. i get to pick what subjects to teach and viola - i am a english teacher. viola, i am a history teacher. and that first day i show up, theyre just going to assume, like all other subs, ill be full of meatballs.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

no, really though. like other subs i'll be full of marrow and opium!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA>>>!!!!!!!!

no, but seriously. they simply hand me the teachers lesson plan and send into the wild blue yonder. the wild child yonder. luckily, i am a highly trained child entertainer. and information giver. and fight diffuser, shoe tyer, and home sickness destroyer. not that everything i know about kids will be useful, but i think i am a touch better off than someone who's sole experience with children is none, because they hatched from an egg, and lived in a hollow tree, where they recieved thier bachelor degree from the university of online at pheonix, and then the fist contact they have with children is to come from thier hovel into the classroom. ive got the leg UP mother fuck. 

this all also means that ill be in chicago sooner than soon. well, not that soon, its all pending employment, and what have you - but ill be in the greater chicagostan area soon enough. which will be a nice change in that i can get the food i want to eat, and to cook with - yet on the other hand i have been spoiled for five years on small college town traffic. im going to have blood squirt from my eyes in anger the first time i get back into real traffic for two hours or so."

"event","some friends of mine came to me, looking for knowledge. they came to the right place, for they sought to exact revenge against a roomate of thiers who does a number of repulsive things. so, in light of this, i have some new pranks which are to be aimed at a roomate who has the unpleasant tendancy to eat all your food. and some other shit, too. 

1) make bratwurst with onions, and upon completion, use a small hypodermic needle to inject the entire length of the sausage with ipacec oil. leave it in the refridgerator till he comes along and eats it. make sure you tell him to drink some water once he starts vomiting, as he will need it to avoid a slight case of dehydration.  

2) leave some seven up and seagrams in a easily found location, but spike the seven up with lemon flavored fleet enema powder. it's supposed to bring it on in 30 minutes. again, try to encourage them (in a subtle way, to avoid having your head split open with a hatchet) to drink some water. it helps.

3) remove the top of the roomates office style chair and pour uncooked shrimp into the hole, then put back the top of the chair. it will smell terrible in afew days (weeks), ive done something similar with a fish - but thats a whole different story.

4) leave out a bottle of jagermiester, with a majority of the contents of the bottle replaced with soy sauce. if you leave enough jag, it will cover the smeel for the most part. the reaction of 7 people who just toasted to a shot of kikomans is pretty swell. 

5) buy a bag of the cheapest looking beef jerky you can find, and replace the contentrs of that bag with a bag of ol' roy dog treats, which look uncannily like cheap jerky. while i didn't taste it myself, i cant imagine it tastes like real human food. in a similar scenario, once i had a roomate who owned a dog (buddy), and purchased dog treats for buddy that looked just like the cheap cream colored imitation oreo cookies. but they tasted like sand, as dog food isnt flavored for people. i tricked a guy (nick urban) to eat the whole bowl of these cookies while in a drunken stupor. so, my throry is that all dog food tastes bad. 

6) melt some chocolate, and drizzle it over cotton balls. they will look exactly like choco-balls. and will tatse like ass. it would be even better if you used unsweetened confectioners chocolate. then it would tatse like serious shit, as opposed to chocolate flavored cotton. 

7) put a clear colored life saver in the shower head, and it will leave them sticky when they get out of the shower. be careful not to use a colored one, or they will know something is afoot when the water shoots out bright red. 

8) leave a water bottle in his the fridge, but fill it with vodka. after a night of drinking most people drink a lot of water, and quickly. usually half the bottle is gone before they realize what is going on. 

9) make some brownies, but add a whole tube of wasabi paste to the bowl. it works better if your roomate is a bake nut, as the greenish tinge will probably be interpreted as weed brownies, and devoured with speed. 

have a good day."

also, i opened some mail i had laying around for a while, and two of the pieces turned out to be birthday letters apologizing for coming late - which i thought was ironic, because i felt bad for opening them late. hmm. everyone was sorry, i guess. 

 I have rediscovered my love for the following: 

A) cooking. not that i really forgot it, but ive experimented and made a couple of really tasty dishes of late, and gotten some compliments on the dishes i have shared with people. so i have new confidence when it comes to the preparation of meals - and i no longer feel stuck in a rut, where i only have one or two meals to fall back on in a pinch. vegetable chicken stew, bangers and mash, garlic chicken pasta. bam! 

B) writing in my paper journal. i went through a period of writing creativly - and that was a shift from a prior habit of writing journal type things in a big sketchbook, with the occasional doodle. well, the other day i went back to the big sketchbook with the idea of writing down my feelings, and not trying to hide them deeply in humor. it worked just fine, like puting on an old hat that you've always liked, but that never went and stopped fitting. sometimes hats do that, they stop fitting all of a sudden. for no reaosn. fuck hats like that, who needs em. anyway, the writing is nice, as i think im being more honest and in tune with what im really feeling day to day."

i met a girl at a summer camp i worked at a couple of years ago. we talked, and flirted, but nothing ever serious came from it. she was fairly aggressive in getting me to spend time with her, which i counted as a posititve sign, but then whenever i tried anything she said that she didnt want to, and that she thought of us as best friends, so on, so forth. nothing happened over the course of the summer, and we left on speaking terms, exchanging screen names. 

so, nothing for the whole first semester, and ive almost forgotten about her - and out of the blue in the beginning of february, she sends me an IM. she's talkin this, she's talking that. she misses me, she wants to hang out, yadda yadda. so im wary, as she used a bait and switch trick before on me. but then she starts talkin about how i can come on valentines day, and we can be valentines, and we can kiss, and how fun it will be. so i think ""all right, thats a good sign - theres no way this can fail"" she lived in champaign, which is about 45 minutes from where i was at the time, and on the 13th, or 12th of february, i drove out to spend the weekend with her. 

so, i get there, and we exchange gifts and the like, i take her out to dinner, etc..  anyway, the whole time she is bitching about one of her roomates, walter, who antagonizes her constantly, and who she claims is a total asshole who ruins her living condition (due to the fact that one time they hooked up, apparently). so i talk her down (constantly) and things seem well. the first night, she lets me sleep in her bed, but she puts a pillow between the two of us, and subtly refuses all my advances. 

this continues on till the second night, on valentines day - we're lying in her bed, and walter yells something through the walls. she goes into his room to fight with him, and i lay in the bed for about 15 minutes. she comes back in, and we continue talking. then, about a half hour later, she goes into walters room again, presumably to yell at him. i lay in the bed for something like a half hour, and finally she comes back in. and this is what she says to me - ""hey, you can watch t.v. or something, but im gonna go blow walter. dont be mad, we can hang out when i'm done."" she really said that, im not kidding. so i got up to leave, and she didnt understand why i was mad, but her roomate came outside (the other girl, not walter) and apologized, saying she usually doesnt know what she's doing. it made me pretty mad, to tell the truth. but in retrospect, i guess it was pretty funny."

I decided to call his bluff and sit back down. he smiled at me, and reached out to shake my hand - yes! this is it, i won! but when i reached out to take it, he faked me out and rushed his hand back to smooth his hair. i got played by them man.   

the waves hit in frothy repetition, and from these waves i emerge. everyone is staring as my naked form unfurls, and as i look down upon myself in amazement. with resolution i march towards the concession stand and ask for a refreshing beverage. 
""sir, please put your swim trunks back on"" says the boy behind the counter.
what is this? these poeple require cloth to protect them from the elements? weaklings. i decided to wrestle the boy, to assert my animal superiority. as i leapt over the counter, he screamed and poured the hot nacho cheese onto my chest. it burned quite badly, but i was able to escape the clutches of the local authorities due to my newfound searing slipperiness.
I never once went back to the wave pool on meth.

"event","looking back at the life i have lived, it seems to me that a number of funny/heartbreaking/poigniant things have happened to me (not that i'm unique or anything).

it is now time that i will share these stories with you. some will be funny, like the one i will share today. others will not be funny, more pathetic combined with humiliating (""i have to blow walter"", for those of you in the know). these are not made up, and are only embellished as much as my memory permits, given the inevitable holes it is riddled with. 

i did not make this story up

one time in junior high, i was invited to a sleepover party for someones birthday, or perhaps for another occasion - it's not very crucial. anyway, at the door of this party, one kid we all knew was giving out chocolates, but not whole bars, just little ghetto wrapped individual pieces of a chocolate bar. after a bite, i decided something was fishy with my individually wrapped chocolate piece and i passed it along to the kid who told everyone he would eat thier chocolates if they did not. he ended up eating 5 or 6 pieces, maybe more - who knows. on goes the evening, mostly spent playing some sort of strategy game on the genesis. as it turns out the chocolate was indeed a laxative, and most of us had to go the bathroom at some point or another in the course of the night, but nothing like jordan (eater of the chocolates). he was in the WC for hours, or so it seemed. he was never really far away from the group, as the loo was quite close to where we were, and so the laxative givers were mocking him the whole time. after a while he decided he had flushed his system clean, and he came to rejoin the group. as he came out of the bathroom, he crapped his pants, and it was a nasty messy sort of business. infuriated, he pulls down his pants, pulls off his tighty-whities, and slings them (full of nastiness) at the laxative giver. it was a primitive sort of simian assult to enact revenge against those who wrongly imprisoned him in the bathroom for the majority of the evening. it was also really gross, but i couldnt stop laughing for hours. it was surreal, in a fecal terrorism sort of way. 
anyway, being 12 was fun."

was startling to open the window 
and see them there. Immobile, but
staring right back as if to say
&#8220;fuck you for ignoring us, we&#8217;ve been 
around for way longer than you 
have. Who the hell are you?&#8221;
a challenge from the mountains?
what was I to do? I opened
the emergency hatch, things began
zipping about the cabin &#8211; children
screaming, adults screaming. I
grabbed an airline blanket, held
it by the four corners.
&#8220;fear not brave passengers! The 
challenge shall not go un-avenged!&#8221;
I leaped out the exit door,
and began to float down.
now the mountains became unsure
they had never really been directly 
confronted before. &#8220;hey mountain!&#8221;
I yelled
&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;
&#8220;I said, hey mountain&#8221;
&#8220;Me?&#8221;
&#8220;are there any other mountains here?&#8221;
&#8220;&#8230;.well, no&#8221;
the mountain seemed a bit sheepish, 
all bark and no bite, what a
shame
I kicked the mountain as hard 
As I could &#8211; &#8220;who matters now, huh?
You like that bitch, you&#8217;re a hill!&#8221;

&#8220;please stop, I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;

"event","ok, i will now introduce you to the saga that was the power cord of my iBook. it stopped working a few days ago, under normal working conditions, i didnt put it in the toaster or anything. I was mad, and i didnt want to have to buy a new one, because the price range for new ibook power cords is something like 80 dollars. so i check my warranty information, and it turns out that i am still under the purchase coverage that comes under the first year. i call apple yesterday at about 4 in the afternnon. the guy on the phone was really friendly, and he said that i wouldget a new one free of charge in the mail, overnight none less. all i have to do is send the old one back to them, free of charge. so this morning hwen i get up, there is a small package from apple waiting for me in the kitchen. it took them 18 hours to get the new part to me. jesus h tapdancing christ!! thats some customer fucking service. needless to say, i am very impressed with the level of service that apple gave to me, and i am very happy that i am currently using one. 
  in other news my roomate eric spent a little time with the PC, which for all of you who didnt rememebr was an unworking piece of ass shit. anyway, he was able to erase everything, and install windows xp without any problems. seemingly. though it is windows, so eventually i will have to wipe it clean again. but i finally have my ideal computer situation up and running. i have the pc hooked to the net, and it is my AIm/ browsing machine, and the mac functions as everything else. and since it's xp, it can transfer to osx pretty easily. 
  also, i am sick. which blows becuase i was going to go to indiana this weekend, today actually - but i dont want to roll in there coughing and spitting and carrying on like im a plauge bearer. maybe it will clear up, maybe don wont care. who knows.

  i found a cool store in canada called roots. it seems like a fairly trendy place, not as bad as abercrombie, more like trendy clothing just for canadians (or so i hear from my canadian co-workers). anyway, i like them because they carry clothing in my size, even pants. not that i have to wear capes and mu-mu's due to my girth or anything, but i am a burly fellow, and it is very hard to find a consistent supplier of XXL clothing. but today i found a pair of pants for only 25 american dollars, and theyre cool! holy fucking shit, batman! anyway, finding pants is this huge chore for me, because most stores only carry up to a 40 waist size, and big and tall stores only carry dumpy fatass old man docker taper leg pleated khakis. a lose-lose situation. so to find a normal looking pair of pants at a normal young people store is an amazing thing to me. 
   my kids this session are much more of a pain that last time - there are just some real whiners and botches in this group, nothing like that last ones, who were all just kids wanting to have fun. so anyway, i am ready to be gone from camp by this point, i miss home, i miss my friends, i miss katie - it just seems about time to get back to the semi-real world. but, being at home will be no cake walk, as i have to find employment to pay my bills. i could easly spend 3 or 4 months doing fuck-all, but then i would just piss away all the money i have right now. i dont want that to happen. so...i need a job when i get home. i have 10 or so days left or avoidance, and then i will have to go and face me some bull-shit. sigh.
  things will be fine once i figure out what to do with the rest of my life. there are lots of people at camp discussing european travel at some point in the summer following this one, and while i want to travel and see the world, i just dont know how plausible that will be in terms of my life plan at this particular moment. not that i have an intricate and expansive plan to work with, i just dont know if it's the right thing to do now. i'm young. i have lots of time to go do fun things and explore. who knows where i'll be. stop thinking so much. stop worrying. live for today. cherish the moment. your birthday is coming up soon, just enjoy the celebration, and the rush of summer stories that are going to come with the fall, and the falls return of your regular friends. be happy. yes. i have lots of good things to look forward to. the rest of my life will come in time. stop worrying. live. breathe. things are good.

i've really been missing home.. and with all the stress of finals, and being sick (which just sucks because my mommy isnt' here to make me all better :( ... ) and everythign else combined...it's killing me..

things are stressful w/ friendships, relationships, and everything inbetween right now.. so that makes things worse.. i really miss teresa and all my friends from home...
i just wish that whenever something goes wrong i could just run down the street into the arms of my bestest friend (T-face of course)... i just miss the constant support of those who i KNOW CARED! its really tough here, i've only known these people at most four months.... and a lot of times they aren't who u think they are or they pretend to be... which makes it really dificult to trust them... which makes it really tough to feel comfortable talking about my problems ...

ugh.. overall i just miss home...
i miss my friends, i miss my family... 

ugh.. i wanna go home!!!"

"event","<P>oprah is a genius.. there is this guy that wrote a book called ""he just isn't that into you"" ... six simple little words that could change your life... basically yesterdays show was about how if a guy really likes u and is really ""into"" u.. u wont have to make excuses for why he isn't there or why he doesn't call.. there should be no mixed messages, if he likes u he'll show it... <BR>that is something i'm working on thinking about.. it's tough to take sometimes.. but why waste your time on someone who really doesn't care as much as u do? there was one thing he said ""don't waste the pretty"" one of his co-workers was talking about some guy who was supposed to call her but didn't and she was just gonna call him because maybe he was <EM><STRONG><U>busy</U></STRONG></EM> but that is just an excuse.. he said to her, 'you are so pretty, why are u wasting your time and beauty on him.... don't waste the pretty'.. </P>

<P>oh this is the start of something good, don't you agree?<BR>i, i haven't felt like this in so many moons, you know what i mean?<BR>and we can build through this distraction, as we are standing on our feet...</P>
<P>so since you wanna be with me, you'll have to follow through with every word you say<BR>and i, all i really want is you, you to stick around, i'll see you everyday, <BR>but you have to follow through... you have to follow through...</P>

"event","this is such a funny email from my mom from her friend.. lol oh man :)

This is so true.  I can't stop chuckling... 
I want to thank all of you who have taken the time and  trouble to send me 
  your damn chain letters over the past couple of years. 
  Thank you for making me feel safe, secure, blessed, and wealthy. Because of 
  your concern... I no longer can drink Coca Cola because it can remove 
  toilet stains.  I no longer drink Pepsi or Dr Pepper since the people who 
  make these products are atheists who refuse to put ""Under God"" on their 
  cans. I no longer drink anything out of a can because I will get sick from 
  the rat feces and urine. 
  I no longer use Saran wrap in the microwave because it causes cancer.  I no 
  longer check the coin return on pay phones because I could get pricked with 
  a needle and infected with  AIDS.  I no longer use cancer causing 
  deodorants even though I smell like a water buffalo on a hot day. 
  I no longer go to shopping malls because someone will drug me with a 
  perfume sample and rob me.  I no longer receive packages from UPS or FedEx 
  since they are actually Al Qaida in disguise. 
  I no longer shop at Target since they are French and don't support our 
  American troops. I no longer answer the phone because someone will ask me 
  to dial a stupid number for which I will get the phone bill from hell with 
  calls to Jamaica, Uganda, Singapore, and Uzbekistan. I no longer eat pre- 
  packaged foods because the estrogens they contain will turn me gay. 
  I no longer eat KFC because their chickens are actually horrible mutant 
  freaks with no eyes or feathers.  I no longer date the opposite sex because 
  they will take my kidneys and leave me taking a nap in a bathtub full of 
  ice. 
  I no longer have any sneakers -- but that will change once I receive my 
  free replacement pair from Nike. I no longer buy expensive cookies from 
  Neiman Marcus since I now have their recipe.  I no longer worry about my 
  soul because I have 363,214 angels looking out for me.  I no longer have 
  any savings because I gave it to a sick girl who is about to die in the 
  hospital (for the 1,387,258th time). 
   
  I no longer have any money at all, but that will change once I receive the 
  $15,000 that Microsoft and AOL are sending me for participating in their 
  special e-mail program.  Yes, I want to thank all of you soooooooo much for 
  looking out for me! I will now return the favor. 
  If you don't send this e-mail to at least 1200 people in the next 60 
  seconds, a large bird with diarrhea will crap on your head at 5:00 pm this 
  afternoon and the fleas of a thousand camels will infest your armpits. I 
  know this will occur because it actually happened to a friend of a friend 
  of a friend . . ."

college life is going pretty good for the most part.. i came home this last weekend and i had so much fun! it was sooo nice to see everyone and it seemed like me and my mom really got a long well :) which definatly made it a good trip.. we had a few.. disagreements.. but i knew those would happen! lol oh well.. i really miss the people from home.. i went to the trenton mb comp. and it was awesome! Franklin MB is awesome!!... especially the colorguard!! hooray.. it was really nice to go see them and get all those hugs!! :(.. i miss them all.. and i miss colorguard in general.. :( :( that was kinda sad.. but they got second and went up like 8 points?? great job! hooray! then i went and hung out w/ people from church! i miss them too! i actually found myself missing justin.. wow lol!! haha jk justin u know i love u! lol so it was cool to see all them, julie justin phil and i were all back from college! then i hung out with my BEST T!! oh man.. i definatly miss her waaaaay too much.. :( but i love her and she is doing well and thats good :) :) hehe um.. sunday morning i had caravan report! and it was great! and i had soo much fun.. and i didn't cry.. until the very end we got out into the narthex after the recessional.. and katrina came up to me w/ tears in her eyes.. adn i was gone.. adn JULIE TOO!! haha the three of us were pathetic.. adn we were told that plenty of times by justin! lol thanks!! :( haha it was all good... but then the kickoff for 04-05 youth group happened.. we played a bunch of games and it felt like old times.. tehn kath went through the schedule.. and i was like oh man hay ride! i love the hay ride.. adn i totally just realized.. i don't do that anymroe.. i'm done.. no more.. and that made me soo sad.. all of a sudden i just wanted to leave adn go cry by myself somewhere.. it really sucked... so then we went home and steph was there.. it was good to see her! then we went to mrs. fraske's viewing... that was tough, poor trevor. i feel so bad for the family.. i can't even imagine how tough that all was.. and i really wanted to go to the funeral but it was today and i was booked all day w/ classes and other stuff.. i miss trevor a lot too.. i miss my daily hug before lunch :( i miss my roosie from dave.. i haven't talked to soooo many people from franklin.. i talked to danny williams today! i havent actually talked to him in a looong while.. :( tehre are just soo many people i'm going to lose touch w/... i talked to allison casey out at NYU!! oh man.. 

life here is pretty good.. i'm doing ok.. making friends.. :) its tough though.. to know things will never be what they were before.. but it's ok .. it's just called growing up.. i guess... it kinda sucks every once and a while.. but u know.. i guess its just gotta happen.. oh well i miss everyone sooo much and i love emails and phone calls and if any of u EVER need me.. i'm here for u.. here being in albion.. but lol i'll always listen :-D if you want my address or email or phone numbers just IM me Panda8895.. i'm sure u all have that.. lol haha oh well.. i love u all.. :( miss u all too...

"event","Well first off I'll start with today :) then i'll talk about my trip and then other random things :) haha i'm so tired

Today i taught preschool at church. it was alright, there is a little three year old who doesn't talk too much but she's such a cutie and she calls me 'panda bear' as opposed to 'ms amanda' like the other kids? lol it's SOO cute!! went to taco bell for lunch :) saw bob! i miss him he's so funny then i came home and set up my printer/scanner and my internet on MY computer! hooray!! 

COLORADO WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER!!

i was sooo worried going into this. but it was amazing! 

sunday we left early early in the morn. flew to colorado took a bus ride there hungout in front of the campus for a loooong time but it was fun before we checked in and then we took our stuff to our room (I LOVE MY TERESA SO MUCH SHE WAS AN AWESOME ROOM MATE!!!) we ate dinner(food was alright but VERY repeatative over the whole week) then went to a meeting at Lincoln Center (that's also where 'keynote' and worship are held-so u know) we were the only group who had to walk there because we flew instead of driving like all the otehr groups***sidenote: we took 45 youth and 4 chaperones; arkansas took 56 total but other than that we were the biggest group.. some groups had like four students and some had like 20 all different sizes*** so we walk to LC which was about 1.5 miles away(we walked about 10 miles a day because we went to LC 2x a day and the dining hall was sorta far away too) so we sang some songs and let me tell u I GOT GOOSEBUMPS from singing.. if u just stop to listen u can hear 400 others singing at the top of their lungs with passion :) it's amazing! then we had our first rec event. it was just in the cafeteria and they had music and ice breakers and games and stuff :) fun! so then we went back to our hall(Ingersoll) and had devotionals which was short because we didn't ahve too much to talk about then to bed :)

monday we had our first day w/ the routine we had to learn. t and i woke up early to shower but a little too early o well then breakfast which was always delicious then keynote. we had a man speak about the theme of the day 'found by god' he'd explain it w/ a skit and some songs. we also had 'energizers' which were awesome!! this lady named Cindy was so cool. I can't even try to explain them they were just that cool. ::::BREAKFAST 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 :::BREAKFAST:: haha :) so then after keynote we went to small groups. there were about 20 or so people in our small groups ( i had Liz and Alex W. in my small group too) and we also had 'search groups' which were about 6 people from our small group in a little group. I met some really great people from my small/search groups whom i really hope to keep intouch with. after keynote we had about 2 hours for lunch and just chillin. sometimes we'd play cards or just hangout and talk or stuff. then was another small group session. after that we had a big break from like 4 until 6:30 and we had to eat dinner sometime in there. then we had worship (our group would all walk together) and before worship they projected slides of pictures the photographer took through the day. worship would start out w/ Inho playing his guitar and we'd sing :) then came teh sermon.. i wasn't particually looking forward to it but it came.. the pastor steve poos-benson? got up on stage w/ his black robe on and he stood behind the podium and said 'sit back and relax' and he tore off his robe and kicked off his shoes and bob segar 'old time of rock and roll' comes on and we all jump up and start screaming and dancing! he was awesome i never felt bored during the sermons so after the worship we went back to the rec event which was the 'olympics' it really helped build our small group up. that's when i started talking to Jared. ;) hehe u'll learn more about him later. so then we had devotionals. we got in there and played the song 'undignified' and we all got up and danced and jumped and sang!! it was awesome!! then we went to bed.. or did we? i think that was the pixie stick night!hahah so listen Teresa and i decieded it'd be a good idea to eat HUGE pixie sticks at like midnight and play cards w/ justin jonathan and zack but it wasn't lol we ended up w/ a mess of a room w/ cards EVERYWHERE!! we were crazy.. lol

tuesday was the same as monday except the kareokee. Liz and I taught Jared how to play euchre.. and he beat us.. :( which kinda is not good considering he just learned! lol so kareoke i have to say our group was awesome.. we had t and katrina up there for 'it don't impress me much'; kristen seamen up there for 'i love rock and roll'; brennan and pete up there for 'newyork newyork' and they were ALLL amazing! :) really and truly amazing :) hehe and devotionals that night was really really cool. we had a really special close night that i think everyone needed :)

wednesday was different. the morning was all the same all up until like after lunch i think? it was our day off so we were gonna go to the rockies and hike but it rained so we couldn't but we went to a look out point and took pics and stuff and that time was really cool for me. then the worship was pretty solemn the theme was 'lost?' and so it was really touching. the rec event was kinda cool but it could also feel kinda depressing at times. it was all very very quiet and on your own and a night of reflection which i definatly needed :) 

thursday was the same as monday and tuesday. durning our free time i hung out w/ my friend Jared. it was a lot of fun. the rec event was in the middle of the day. Teresa, Jared and I were playing with hoola hoops and these nylon tennis ball things? lol but then it really started to rain so we had to go in. but we went out in the rain for a little bit :) after that was dinner and then worship. after worship was a concert. Paula Larke kinda scared me a little.. she was fun and pumped us up but kinda vulgar. she was good though i really enjoyed hearing her message. then devotionals and bedtime :)

friday was our last day. it was tough to say good bye because i made soem really good friends. i met a girl from arkansas who had the coolest accent!! lol but we had a great time and i wouldn't change anything. after dinner was a dance and it was fun. then worship. it was really touching and amazing. i loved the singing. at the end we all got little glowsticks and inside the LC we stood in lines that formed a cross and sang amazing grace. and i cried (I LOST TO KATRINA!! :( haha) but it's ok.. i cried a lot that week. all 400 of us walked back to the dorms. devotionals were really tough.. we had senior night and every comment meant sooo much and i love everyone who went on that trip. **tell everyone how much they mean to you and how much you love them, sometimes u don't even know how much u can mean to someone** well some really mean people who worked there came in, in the middle of our stuff and told us we had to leave. it was terrible... i don't understand. they were people teaching at a christian youth conference and they basically said to our faces that they didn't care what we were doing, we were even in teh middle of a prayer and the guy came in again and yelled at us.. it was aweful i have never seen such a poor demonstration of faith.. but we finished our stuff at the air port the next day... we never did sing friends...:( 

saturday we had to say our final goodbyes... very very tough... and we left for the airport. it was my birthday and they sang to me a lot :) i love u all thank you!! morris's and us went to buddys for dinner.. it was a lot of fun :)

i want to say thank you to everyone on that trip. it was amazing and the most life changing experience i've had. for someone who thought they had a pretty good faith.. wow i mean WOW!! it was so powerful. 

i want to say thank you to my friends as well. u helped me through the week. 

teresa i know there will never be a real goodbye for us. but i want to say u mean the world to me and i love u with all my heart. u were teh best roomate i could ever ask for and i love u

to my seniors.. i'll miss u so much...i can't believe it's all over.. :( wow

to others.. i love u... thank you...

Try to avoid putting the song title in the line. Then, have your friends comment and see if they know the songs.

1. I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
2. Reach down your hand in your pocket, pull out some hope for me
3. Oh here we go time to shake that a** on the dance floor

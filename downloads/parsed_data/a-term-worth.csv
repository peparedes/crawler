His breath deep, slow, attentive, until he stood, looked forward and did not look down again. 

It was customary after supper for the family, of three, to accompany each other to their warm beds to talk about the missing and the missed.

Spoken to like ghosts but felt like people. Remembered as bodies but seen as souls."

Open roofs are sultry forts used to keep in the pain

Concerned for the one you love
Callous fingers used to pick you up, never felt the same

Felt your soul pass through my vein's

Gathered up our things
Cold bit our necks so we moved in quietly

Makes me stutter, unclear

When life's demands they makes you weary
Toss and turn all your joy

Slut zone:
Population: Every guy you knew you could never spend an hour giving a damn about.

But the only thing I'm jumping into right now is pity for you weak.
If only you could see yourself feeling so damn bad for yourself
Feeling horny and passionate at the same time.

if only you were as cool as yourself.

And you act like you like this
Its a scene and it sings
With your Polaroid captions
Whitty remarks
You laugh with each other
As you lay in your arms

And snap it goes
Another memory floats like snow
It's melting on your tongue 
Sublime and trite

You put your faces together
And you smile real big
And you act like you like this
Is on a movie screen
As your grin grows wide
And pops into place
It's your life inside a lie
And gone without a trace

And snap it goes
Another memory floats like snow
It's melting on your tongue
Sublime and trite"

In the cool wind of carelessness
And with a handle of love
An innocent bystander waves cautiously in my eyes
Saying ""Are you enlightened? You never used to wear this disguise?""
But the problem runs deeper
I've made this place my home
Burned the bridges carrying water and supplies all along

My head was filled with ideas I couldn't quite hold on
Unmediated signals passed through miles of line long
I trudged through the swamplands
Barreled through the falls
Messed up my position
Now I know I'm in the wrong

I cradle your shoulder blade
While my arm goes numb and I can't escape
Why would I want to?
With the sun rising outside of your window
The only dream I've had tonight rests her head upon my unforgiving relentless heart beat
And every second is another chance to wake you up
It wouldn't be so bad
Maybe this heart is beating just to wake you up
But you really don't need that
Content in your wonder world and harmony
Well this harmony and all the discord colliding in one instance
Where you know that one and one make two
Just as much as they don't.
Maybe, they just make one

But everyday babies die in hospital closets
Closed up with stitching sealed up with plastic
Bags filled to the brim with our grim future
Not my future
See, I remember a time when I didn't care
No, I lied, I did care, a lot
But then the caring and concern turned into anger and denial
""How oh how did we end up here!""
And I remember again
My eyes are coming wide open
But nobody wants that to happen
Where my former princess in chief is waiting for me to shape up
Forget about my summer of white
Because it's all I could see
White beautiful blindness currently playing my favorite play list
Of Pavement and Soco Amaretto Lime
I can't go back and I won't ever look back
There is too much at stake to be the bearer of that cross again
I already have someone to do that for me
Now, I can look at now, I can look forward
I can breathe again without wondering why I still do
But my brothers know a different story
They know a 14 or 10 year old's impression of my burn-out self
I make them sad, I make them disappointed when they look to me
I am your model for the future, son number one
And boy, I'm hoping Mom and Dad didn't think they got it wrong
For every distorted reality I have is made a little more clear
All because of them
I can't help but love them all
But I'm always trying to run out of that cold steel garage door
All while still allowing my lysergic pipe dream to continually cough up nightmares
Depicting the fallacies of my young adulthood
My statement to the world
My middle finger to anything in my way
Yet I remain stoic, numb, uncharacteristic to the world around me
So I talk to make it better
I fill my lungs to make it stronger
I ride my box spring mattress to the only freedom from the day
Where I know that you used to lie too
As a teenager with your long hair
Bell bottom jeans, and worn out baseball you threw at the ceiling
I wish I could tell you how much we're the same person
But you already know, just not how I do
I just know that my future means we'll all be okay
I am just a phase right now
Slowly oscillating into a dream
That one day will become a reality
Until then, I sit in my own hospital
Healing, healing, and healing"

"event","I really njoyed Fadia's article on Albert Namatjira in her Livejournal.  This was a fantastic link to Alf Dubbo as they both are very similar characters.  As Fadia states, Albert Namatjira was one of the first Aboriginal artists to be influence by the western arts just like Alf Dubbo.  This led me to wonder if perhaps Patrick WHite was influenced by Namatjira in his creation of Dubbo.  We know that Dubbo is a who White wishes he himself was artistically as well as being partly Blakean.

I remember doing work on Namatjira and being saddened by the fact that he was ostracised fromboth his Aboriginal community and the white Australia.  He was forced to live in a middle ground in a time of great racism as he attempted to socialise with both niches of society.  It is sad how how world often works."

"event","Kath has once again made me think about my life and where i stand in my relationships with people.  She has started by talking about the old saying ""If you love someone set them free.  If they come back they're yours.  If they don't, they never were.""  This is a very interesting statement but i much preferred her second attemppt at the quote syaing ""If you love someone set them free.  If someone loves you, don't fuck up"".   This i found both amusing and interestign as i began to think about Love itself and how hard it is to find a person that firstly doesn't annoy the shit out of you when you spend longer than 24 hours straight with them and secondly who you don;t annoy the shit out of in the same situation.  cdouple this with actually enjoying their company, being attracted to them, finding them interesting and entertaing as well as having that little inexplicable spark.

Love is not something to be messed with and kath has said it perfectly.  If you somehow manage to find someone who loves you, then don't fuck up because chances are you will regret it."

"event","This week i will try my hand at a review.

I have just finished watching the first episode of the third season of LOST.  Now for all of my subscribers you will know that i am a LOST bandit.. I go crazy for the show, an di just can't really explain it.  They never reveal any answers but continually pose questions and i realise this is extremely annoying.  But like a heroine addict who swears to quit sticking needles in his arm i sit in front of a screen and soak up 40 minutes of the best show currently on television.

The first episode of season three starts with a bang and you get to see the mysterious Others, and where they live.  They don't really live in tents, but have this Leave it to Beaver suburban area whre they live very normal lives.  A little too normal actually (book clubs and muffin baskets normal).  Jack, Sawyer and Kate are being held captive and haven't really been asked any questions.  They seem to be being held in this sort of old zoo type thing where i swear they must have been doing tests on animals.  This backs up my theory that the Others are military scientist type people who are testing everything from humans to animals to fish.  CRAZY i know.

The first episode left me hanging on the edge of my seat and quite frankly i can't wait til next week to see what happens.  No doubt there will be more questions asked and zero answered but that is the beauty of it.  I'll try and keep everyone updated.

And sucked in to anyone i just ruined it for.."

"event","Kath begins her ive hjournal post by discussing the differnces in beliefs between Mrs Jolly and Miss Hare.  They obvioulsy have some very big diffrerences in what they term faith.  Mrs Jolly isa very typical Protestant who believes that it is far more imprtant to make appearances at Church rather than having an internal system of faith.  Quite franly these people shit the hell out of me.  I tend to believe that going to Church or mass is a very important factor in the Christian faith but not if you simply go to be seen and are an empty vessel not listening or taking in anything useful.

Miss hare has th eright idea in a Blakean sense.  She sees the beauty in all things, from a thunderstorm to the grass.  Chances are she probably thinks worms are beautiful too.  No that is a great way to live ypur life.  Cherishing everything that comes your way and never rejecting anything that God has put in front of us.  Everything has beauty because they were all created from nothing.  I would like to see Mrs Jolly create a universe!!

In short we should all try to see through the eyes of Willia Blake and maybe we will all be better off because of that.  If everything we see is beautiful there would be a lot less problems in the world."

Freezing actually.
That there's no warmth anywhere,
Except for in our minds.

How much longer,
do we have to wait.
Before someone lights a fire.
Doesn't have to be big.

It will grow, hopefully.
People will be warmed,

the mistakes that we made."

"event","It is interesting to look back over the past five years and to see were the world has changed, either for the better or worse.  This day five years agao was obviously a very scary time for each of us as we all watch events out of our control unfold across the globe.  I personally was extremely scared about where the world was heading.  I was only fifteen and could still see that there was a dark future ahead for most nations.

In five years i unfortunately still have this sense of forboding.  Nothing really has changed on the terror front (except for the fabrication that Iraq was somehow involved) and there doesn't seem to be an end to these surreal wars that are fought in foreign territory.  Nobody seems to care what happens as long as it doesn't happen here.  However, i think we need to wake up because sooner rather than later we will suffer.  America has, Britain has.. we aren't that much further down the list.

Nothing really has changed.  The world is even more firghtening than before and all i hope is that we see the futility in our actions before it is too late to change."

in response to your comment about Theotormon being self-absorbed yet not understanding what he truly wants, nor how to achieve it, i agree with you as well.  theotormon is stubborn and this is emphasised by his rigid-ness in Blake's image.  The straight lines symbolise a sense of inabilty to understand and empathise with other people.  Oothoon has a beautiful soul and is the epitome of the intelligent woman, but theotormon is a so much a product of a patriarchial society that he does not appreciate her independence or intelligence.

Blake would be a happier man in this day and age but not completely happy as some men continue to act like theotormon.  Sad really."

"event","I really enjoyed today's lecture discussing ""the Visions of the Daughters of Albion"" and in particular the film we watched regarding blake.  I was worried we were never going to see the end of the documentary.  Thisfilm realy brought to light many of the facts about Blake which i wanted to know and i was impressed with what many of the people had to say.

i liked the part when one of the men were speaking about when blake died and one of his friends went to close his eyes so that the vision would stay in.  I have to agree with the gentleman who stated blake's vision is still alive today and continues to affect those who are privy to his work. I know that i am a better person after reading Blake.  he allows readers to become in touch with their emotions and this is a rare trait as the world we live in becomes faster an more fantic.  I know i rarely have time just to sit and think about life as i always have a dead line.

Just another rant about god knows what."

I put it down to Blake trying to say that Theotormon is as stubborn as Newton (science) and rigid in their beliefs.  They won't accept any other points of view and it is this flaw which stops theotormon from moving on and accepting Oothoon for what she is.  They are both drawn with very straight lines and evoke feelings of a person with a hard exterior and little emotions.

P.S. Sorry about the size of the image but i am not very good with this sort of stuff."

The towers stood tall 
which i knew would fall. 
Like a thief
i stole your money
spent it on something bloody.
United we stand tall
divided nation that's all.
Nothing wrong with division
it was my number one vision. 
I killed your family
brother sister son and more.
I am the media 
fed you with the lies 
you wanted to hear. 
You elected me twice
and i took away your democratic right.
I have a dream
no not one Martin Luther King
wanted to see.
But a dream that America
will be the number one oil land.


This poem by Nike really caught my attention today, because she sums up what most people are thinking in present day society.  For instance, the true intentions behind the many wars which the United States are involved in, either directly or indirectly.  And due to this, Australia, as an ally of the big U.S. of A is also part of these wars.

I really enjoy the fact that Nike has been able to state all the negativities which i see in the Bush government and is able to put them in a poem so effectively and concisely.  She analyses Bush's dream to go to war so, and the lies he spread to gain a support from the people.  As well as the fact that he has divided his nation as well as the world on the issue of war, which is upposedly attacking terror, but is also lining the pockets of the American government.  This is not a morally correct war, and many people do not see this as it does not affect them in the slightest.  It occurs a million miles away and they only see the disaster on CNN.

People should not believe the lies they are told by by a governmentwhich wasn't even democratically elected.. Ahh Florida.. Whenever thinking about the issues that face the world i am often reminded of that cliched expression:

The only thing needed for evil to succeed is for good people to stand-by and do nothing."

"event","For this week i thought i would try my hand at a review.  I recently watched the movie ""A History of Violence"" and was pretty impressed by what is saw.  The movie was about a small town diner owner who turns into a hero when he stops a robbery.  However, when this occurs he becomes somewhat famous and is later visited by gangsters who think that he is someone they used to know.  This someone they used to know caused them quite a bit of pain a few years ago and they want revenge.  Following this, the viewer is left to decide whther he is the person they think he is or not.  i won;t spoil the surprise.

This movie was very enjoyable.  I liked the fact that it did not drag on like most movies these days tend to do.  it went for a stock standar 90 minutes and everything was wrapped up nicely.  I also felt that nothing was left unaswered not was too little time spent of anything.  I really do not like these epic movies of todays standards that ast for 3 hours and they go no where.  Only to have 17 sequels or spin offs.  The movie may have been a little too gratuitous but not too me.  It was an honest movie, in terms of the mans family and how they deal wit the situations confronting them.  Nothing waas made too cliched and the flim was original to me.  However, i will probably find it was a remake of some John Wayne film.  Nevertheless i recoomend it to anyone who is looking for a good friday night in."

Letely i have been looking at Nike's livejournal and so far i have liked and enjoyed what i have seen.  She obvioulsy has a talent for poetry and this is evident in the thousands of poem's she pumps out on her livejournal.  The scary thing is they are very good and much better than i could ever hope to achieve.  I guess it is because she writes from her heart and is not scared to let people read her inner most thoughts.  I personally find this difficult and am constantly worried about what people will think when they read my livejournal. I don't know why i do this, it is silly, but i do.

Anyways, enough about that, i also wanted to say that i think Nike may be on to something with this whole ""Words"" idea, hehe.  I take her poem to mean, and i could be wrong (high possibility) that she believes that actions are necessary in todays world to fully understand somebody.  We express ourselves with words and a lot of the time these can be very useful in expressin our emotions but they can be tainted.  People can lie and they can cheat, however, actions speak for themselves.  I believe actions truly define a person and their goals, and ultimately you will discover if they are selfish or selfless."

"event","The daugters of Albion is rather depressing isn't it.  The parts of the poem we have read, which isn't that much, and the parts which i understand, which is even less, reminds me somewhat of discrimination and oppression.  I really do not have much experience with discrimination, either as the discriminator or the discriminatee but i am sure it sucks.  The fact that a poor woman can be raped and then held to blame is a travesty and once again William blake is ahead of his time by criticising this aspect of society.  As well as this, not only is Blake tackling a big issue but he really does it rather well doesn't he.

I wonder what blake would criticise in present day soiety.  No doubt the wars that seem to be popping up everywhere, and no doubt the discrimination which still exists.  He would definitely still attack organised religion, maybe he wrote the Da Vinci Code.  i suppose Blake is still getting his message across long after his death.  I know that he has been able to get through to at least the students at ACU Strathfield.  As well as that, i have been telling everyone who will listen about how good he is.  As an artist and a poet.  A bit of a jack of all trades.  Make us all look like idiots really doesn't he.

"event","I was just looking over fadia's livejournal and was quite impressed by her ideas and thoughts on Blake, and the different personalities he has.  Fadia has had a look at the various faces of Blake, such as ""Blake the Hippie"" or ""Blake the womans lib"" and i find it quite funny yet true as he was a man who believed in a world free from oppression and corruption.  All aspects of the world we are still attempting to achieve.

Blake was definitely a man ahead of his time.  I am not the only person to think this, because if you look through our class' livejournals, nearly all people say this.  Blake created his art so that the world could understand his emotions and view his opinions on society. In nealry all his ""Songs of Innocence and Experience"" Blake is attacking a flaw in society.  I believe that this was his way of showing the world's imperfections so that they could be remedied before it was too late.  This was a symbol of love for the world as Blake knew that all hope was not lost for society and that it could be saved.  

Blake saw himself as the defender of the British empire, however i think this title is too small.  Blake continues to save the world through his poetry as he points out our flaws so that we can see our mistakes and remedy our flaws.  the fact that his poetry and art is still having this effect today is a testament to his talent and ability."

He has once again redefined my views on Livejournal through his whacky and crazy image of William Blake.  how he gets the evil computer to do his bidding i will never know.  But he has made a very witty, funny and entertaining image of Blake explaining himself, his vies and his life.  This is a very exciting image and one which i know all people in our class enjoyed.  Everybody definitely got a laugh and were in awe. in fact i saw some people turn green with envy.

Jordan continually excels with livejournal and i just wanted to send him out a congratulations for the work he has done in making us all look bad.  Even though i do this for myself most of the time.  Jordans work is prrof that livejournal works for some people as a means for expressing themselves.

Thank God jordan was born in this day and age, rather than the time of william blake cause he would have probably been labelled a whacko just like our friend the poet.  But just think how scary it would be if he was born in the future when computers are going to be more powerful. he might just control the world, nay the universe."

All I want is your understanding
As in the small act of affection

Is almost everybody's question

And I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

I prefer peace
Wouldn't have to have one word of possession
But essentially I'm an animal
So just what do I do with all the aggression?

[Hook]
Well I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

[Verse]
Life is a one-way street, and if you could paint it
I'd draw myself going in the right direction
So I go all the way - like I really really know -
But the truth is I'm only guessin'

And I've tried
Everything but suicide
Oooh but it's crossed my mind

But yes - it's crossed my mind

I decided to put this song on my livejournal because it is fukn sweet.  This is a great song with great lyrics and whenever i listen to it it always gets me thinking.  Nothing bad but just gets me thinking.  DJ Dangermouse is very good and i recommend lots of his stuff to anyone.  Im sure you all like the Gorillaz.

i often think that music is the poetry of today and it really one of the best ways to express yourself in the modern world.  Some musicians have wonderful words which mean so much to listeners and it is this similarity to poetry which i relaly enjoy.  Often i just find myself listening to the words rather than the beat and this is generally what attracts me to a song.  I can empathise with the composer of a song or just enjoy the concept of what the messagethey are trying to get across.  This is also what attracts me to poetry, the fact that a writer can put so much emotion into words that flow so beautifully.  The imagery from poetry is the key for me and Blake does this without a flaw.

Well Done Kath, i know this is just a simple poem but it really does capture the mood of when a mistake is made and all you want in the world at that moment is for time to go backwards 30 seconds so that you can erase your tragic mistake.

Good Work Bucko."

When the bickering had finally stopped the once happily married couple were left to pick up the pieces of their now seperate lives.

It had been a marriage based on love for the first year.

However this ideal had changed as their lives grew further apart through various career changes.

As Susan's career had developed so had Mark's resentment of his higher paid and respected partner.

Their relatiosnship drifted until only one common ground remained, the most important of all.

Their eight year old daughter was an sad victim of their failed love.



Blah blah blah... Maybe ill go on with this in the future."

Also it isn't a bad idea to vent some anger through poetry, especially through live journal as other people can read it and back you up.  I am sure that many poets use poetry to vent and this is what allows them to write great poems as the subject means more to them and they have a passionate feeling.

When passion comes into something that you are doing it means that you can, in this case poetry, write with more significance and it will undoubtedly produce a much better poem.  This is the case in many poems.  For example Blake in the School Boy and To Spring clearly had a passion for what he was writing and the result was fantastic.

But saying that, i wouldn't want to piss Kath off at all and and ill make sure i dont.

"event","The School Boy was a poem which i completely understood and even agreed with.  It was also a very enjoyable poem and reminded me of the poetry which Wordsworth wrote.  It had simple language and great imagery which i really enjoy because it allows me to be drawn into the poetry as well as empathise with what the poet is trying to say.

In the School Boy, William Blake has stated that he views the current process of education to be detrimental to children as it does not allow for children to act in the way that they should be.  Instead of being outside and playing and learning from experience they are forced to sit inside and abide by too many regulations.  This takes away a child's independence, freedom and imagination.  When children are no longer students they wont enjoy learning as it has subconsciously been made into a boring chore.  As well as this they won't be able to learn as they won't be able o stimulate themselves.  They have been handed all stimulus and when they are studying individually they will not be able to independently learn.

Lets hope that we as students don't end up like this..

However it seems that whatever he has created it is of a ridiculously high standard.

I already wrote a post about it but i couln't help but commenting on yours as well, just because i found it so interesting.  SOmething about the way a poet describes nature really captivates me.  For instance, Wordsworth last year really moved me in Expostulation and Reply.  I was in a daze too that day just because the poem was so large and took so much time to figure out.  Lucky we all worked through it together getting it piece by piece.

Although i am a man i can understand where you are coming from with the talk about honour having negative connotations but i do think that honour is something many people should aspire towards.  With ""The Garden"" i found that i really liked the idea of nature as an escape which protects us, gives us shade and food.  And when the world becomes so much, the soft grass will catch us when we fall.

I really did like this poem, but i thought it was very difficult to fully grasp. I might need another reading in a garden where i will be confronted with hallucinations."

But it really was a great poem which reminded me of Wordsworth and his love for nature.  Nature is such a integral part of the world that it is nice to be reminded just how much it should be appreciated.  Nature gives us beauty, escape, safety, life and they are all described throughout The Garden.  I really appreciate the fact that Marvel describes the garden as an escape which gives everyone saftey and nourishment.  Protection is necessary for everyone, even the gods and this is described well in this poem. The grass will catch us if we fall."

My parents have been together for over 30 years now and i often wonder how people can achieve such a feat.  Not only to stay interested for so long but to constantly continue working through the tough times and not give up.  It would be tough in a world where society constantly tempts people.

With relationships more my size though it is interesting, as Jenna said how they can sour so quickly and inexplicably.  I have known situations when the guy is so keen on a girl or vice-versa and then it just alters and they avoid each other like the plague.

It was very well acted and  performed and allowed me to gather a further understanding to the play as i was originally struggling with themes and the plot etc. etc.  I have seen Hamlet performed by the Bell Shakespeare company before and that was fantastic as well, however after growing and learning in the last few years i found it much more interesting and easier to understand the play.  It is much easier to understand the play when it is acted out in front of you, rather than just reading words on the page.  Television has ruined my imagination.

This play though was performed extremely well and i really enjoyed the outing.  it was not only good to go watch a Shakespearian play performed well but the setting was also nice as was the company.  I also thought that the fact that the man who played Hamlet was also the director was another plus.  Hamlet is one of the toughest parts in any Shakespearian plays and has a ridiculous amount of lines.  However he played the part very well whilst also having to worry about the other characters and his directing.  this proves that he is a major talent and let's hope he can go far as a thespian."

However as Jenna states, it is funny how through these moments comes a clearer vision when all of sudden it feels as if the world is better and that finally maybe the fog over your life has lifted.

it really is an odd thing that sometimes a terrible depressed feeling is often the catalyst to people overcoming their grief.  I wonder if it is because we have finally reached the end of the road and have no option but to go back towards happiness.  Who knows.  i sure as hell don't.

I appreciate the fact that the wisest character in most of Will's plays is the fool or the person pretending to be crazy.  It almost makes the message being sent that much more meaningful because it is delivered by the most unlikely of characters.  For instance the message of love sent by Feste is made much more obvious seeing as though it is delivered by a fool.  This is a useful technique employed by Will as he allows the messages in his plays to be delivered with more power and meaning so that the viewers and readers can completely understand the issues and ideas in each plays."

"event","I really was interested in Dyana's thoughts concerning Harry Potter and whether the novels will become classics of literature in the future.  They are reasonably well written, but it is worth while to bare in mind that they are designed for young adults.  They are very interesting and have a large ammount of excitement and advneture and i have to say that i am a big fan.  However, they are not of the same standard of Tolkien either in imagery or the story line.  Lord of the Rings is a classic because Tolkien basically created an alternate universe and many readers are drawn into the story completely.

My opinion of the matter is that i hope the Harry potter series do become considered classics as they are merely a great read and offer a high level of fun and adventure.  As well as this, they offer key ideological representations which young adults benefit and learn from.  the fantasy genre lends itself to ideological representations and for that reason, the more harry Potter novels that are read the better.  they allow readers to let their guard down and be takn on a journey which is simple and pure."

Well the Bears have been on a winning streak as of late, with 3 wins out of 3 games and they look to be playing stronger and defending better then ever before.  This week, against the Baulkhalm Hills started out terribly as the Bear went down 6 quick runs to their opposition.  However, this was the last of the Bailkham scoring as the Bears lifted the intensity and began clawing their way back into the game.  This started with 2 runs in the second inning, followed by 3 runs in the third.  However, the Bears comeback took a turn at this point as two more innings went past and the score remained at 6-5 in favour of baulkham.  But the Bears were determined to maintain their winning record and and in the bottom of the final inning managed to squeeze in 2 runs to tae the game away from their opposition.

This win can be credited to a ""never say die attitude"" being exhibited by the Bears in a game where they could have admitted defeat from the outset.  Some noatable performers on the weekend where Pauly who got three hits from three at bats and Hags who defended at third base remarkably well.

Next week the Bears play Concord away and spectators are more than welcome with celebratory drinks always on offer post-game."

Now for all you people out there who have seen and know of the Sopranos then you all know how good the show is.  Unfortunately it isn't on the air right now in Australia.  But it is on in the U.S. and through the power of internet i am able to watch it ad free.  But that is another story for another time.

Now the show is based on the mob boss of New Jersey named Tony Soprano.  The show follows his life with his two seperate familes.  His first family consists of his wife, daughter and son.  They have their own problems which are good to watch but not nearly as exciting as the problems of his other family.  Tony's other family consists of fat, italian men who get their chubby little fingers into every pie possible.  Through this he has accumulated quite a large wealth and a lot of enemies.  Now in the 6th season he has to contend with ongoing hassles from the FBI and i won't spoil the show but he has a turn for the worse.

The show is extremely well written and has drama, action, and comedy galore.  I mean if you guys ever wanted a good show to watch than this is it.  It really is fantastic.  The shows producers want to end it on a high note so it is rumoured that this will be the last season.  However they did say that last season as well.  But seriously guys this is a great show and you will find that after an epsiode you won't quite understand its relevance in the scheme of the entire story but at the end of each series, each episode is tied in perfectly.

Well i have had my rant, now go out and watch it and if anyone else is a keen Sopranos fan then watch them again and get ready for season 6.  It's AWESOME!"

They are supposed to have easy lives and never have to worry about anything.  But ot only does Hamlet lose his father but it was his uncle who did the dirty on him.  And after this he has to appear insane so that he can get revenge.  This is while everyone is telling him to hurry up and get over it.

And i dunno if i would seek revenge for a death, it would be a tough decision.  But Hamlet does live in a different time.  He had to do it for his honour.  But the life of someone else is not what i would want to take, all in the need for revenge.  I mean i have seen enough movies to know that the bad guy who is actually the good guy doesn't become happy once he gets revenge."

Besides if there is one thing my father has taught me in life it is don't shit where you eat.  Complete and utter honesty is not always worth it.  Being polite is often more worthwhile and civility is definitely a necessary gift to be able to travel through life.  Therefore i disagree with some poets who think honesty is valuable above all else.  Because sometimes being honest to the point of being rude is just too damn trouble, even if it would be fun."

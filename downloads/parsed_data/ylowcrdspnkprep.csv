"event","someone felt this way about me

She don't know how much I need her; 
She don't know I'd fall apart, 
Without her kiss, without her touch, 
Without her faithful lovin' arms. 
She don't know that it's all about her; 
She don't know I can't live without her. 
She's my world, she's my everything, 
And she thinks she needs me.

I've been working a lot lately and considering my job is pretty mind dumbing and anyone could do it, I've had a whole lot of time to think about things.  Think about my life, how boring it is, how I can't wait to get out of here.  Experience new things, new places.  So far I'll be in anyone of the following places: california, new york city, boston, philedelphia, texas, or florida.  Some places I know people.  Some places I'll be all on my own.  I don't know where I'm going but I hope it will clear things up, make me grow up some more.  Figure out what's really important to me, and hopefully get me away from all the daily bullshit, or at least give me new bullshit.  Relationships are interesting lately.  I don't exactly know where I fit into the equation in a lot of them.  Romantically, or just friendships.  I guess all I can do now is focus on the art.  Get more done.  Everyone likes me, I've got the skills, now I need the numbers.  One thing that I'm really happy about though is that I'm being wicked responsible.  Paying off my debts and getting Christmas out of the way.  Jeremiah and I are getting better.  I really like that.  I didn't notice how much I missed him.  Somehow, he always finds a way to make me worry less about things.  Dave is still wonderful.  I don't know how things with this shall work out though.  In the begining it was grand, we talked all the time, about everything, and it was never akward, or silent.  Now I feel like I'm bugging him.  I don't know.  Chris is just being stressful.  It bugs, me so much.  I say effort, he pulls away more.  I think maybe it's time I give up completely, surrender.  Somehow for me it's always a loosing battle, and my army is wicked tired.  I don't know quite yet if I'm going to New Hampshire, I still need to talk to Caitlin, but I hope so badly that I get to go.  It would be so rad.  Family is getting better.  While my mom and I are having some problems here for the most part it's just badass.  Let's just hope things stay good."

So first with school, hella hard, and annoying because I have so much shit that I have and am suppose to be doing and I'm so not doing shit.  I honestly don't want to do anything, but like I just feel like I'm getting more and more behind, cause I know that's what's happening.  I need to get my butt in gear

Chris and I aren't together anymore.  I don't really wanna get into a whole lot of detail about that one.  Hurts too much.  You all know how much I cared about him, reading previous entries.  But life doesn't always go the way you want it to.  Things will get better; I hope.

Work.  Omg, stressful, I don't get enough hours, but everytime I work, I'm the only one working.  GOD DAMN IT!

Miah, I miss this boy with all my heart.  It's so nice having a relationship with him again.  We are good, which makes my mom happy.  Plus, he's still wicked hot.

Jerrod, always confusion, but we deal.  Things will work out, no matter how long it takes me to get better.

Alex, we are friends.  I can't love him anymore like he wants me to.  Not right now.  I see friendship for me and him.  I know it hurts him to hear that, but I just don't feel the same.

Caitlin, there is just nothing there no more.

"event","Well, sorry about not ever updating this guys.  It's been wicked busy around here lately.  After finding out about Amanda being pregnant and then returning to school and work.  It seems like I don't have a whole lot of time to just sit down and think.  But that's okay because I love being around people.  Except right now.  I've been awake since 5 this morning because of my little brother.  Screaming and pulling my hair.  At around 7 I finally gave up on the idea of sleep.  I've spent the last day out here, at my dad's house, and it's always a reality check.  I want a lot of stuff.  I know that sounds ridiculously selfish.  However I don't understand how I can ask my dad for something every so often, something that doesn't cost that much, or something that I could really use and he says no.  Yet his wife is able to go out and spend 100 dollars on Tommy clothes on my 1 1/2 yr. old brother who doesn't care that his pants cost 40 bucks.  Yet if I ask for something it's coming out of my Christmas or Birthday presents.  It's like I don't ever deserve to get anything unless they have to buy me something.  I feel so worthless.  Like I don't matter to anyone.  I hate this feeling.  Yet it's so hard to not feel this way when people that are suppose to love and care about you don't give two shits.  

School, is good.  While for most of the day I just sit there because I'm too lazy to do anything of importance or try to work in class, it's nice to be around all the people.

Since I know your going to read this, Caitlin, I don't quite care what you do or don't do anymore.  So have a nice year.

Amanda and everything is good.  Baby weights about one ounce right now, and it could fit in the palm of my hand.  It makes you realize how amazing life really is.

Chris is just wonderful.  I love that boy with all my heart.

Alex and I are friends, and it's the most awesome relationship ever."

"event","I'm exhausted!  The past week has been brutal.  I was upnorth at my cabin from the 14th to the 22nd.  It was boring and it was fun and it was not the same as usual.  It was someone relaxing, except for the fact that I missed Chris.  Oh, and the fact that I found out one of my best friends is pregnant the day before I came home.  That was wicked emotional.  I'm happy for her though, and she's keeping it, which makes me really happy.  She's also being healthy, major plus!  Which leads me to the next thing, we went shopping today.  Which for me, is a sport.  9 hours, of shopping.  It's amazing, my feet are so sore.  The best pain I've ever felt!  Which I bought because school starts, and that's my favorite part, not getting registered and getting books and all of that shit, even though you get to see lots of people you don't remember who all want to hang out with you, it's always about the clothes.  Yes, I am excited about school, for like the frist week, then it basically blows, but for now, I'm looking forward to it.  Had a fantastic day followed by a great night.   MMMMMMM <3 Chris.  That's all I have to say about that.  Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings!  Next, a list of things I love, cause I'm thinking I'm gunna be in a good mood the next couple of days, cause even though I've gone back to work I work like 3 hours.  I love being me!  Ha ha ha ha ha!"

"event","Yeah, so lots of stuff has been happening, lately.  However I'm certainly not about to type it all out!  So if you care to hear what's going on you better call me tomorrow during the day because my nights, are pretty much booked and then Satruday I leave.  So this is kinda my reminder to all that I'm leaving from Saturday the 14th early morning and I'll be back late night on the 21st.  I shall miss you all!  Especially my baby <3 Chris.  Anyways, I will try to say good bye to everyone before I leave, but if I don't, Much love, I will miss you, don't forget me, and keep rocking out lovers!    Love always,me"

"event","Summmer is almost gone, and I feel like I should have done so much more with it.  However I know it was way less stressful that if I would have tried to work and do art.  Soon though, I go back to school, and work, and everything that I hate.  Not that I hate school, or the people there, or working on art and not procrastinating, but I just hate all the stress it causes.  So anywyas, laziest day ever.  Woke up wicked early to talk to Chris before he had football practice, then woke up when he got home from practice and just bummed around with him.  Took a 3 hour nap and then woke up to do some laundry so I can be all packed by Friday night to go to my cabin on Saturday.  Then I shall be gone, from the 14th to the 21st.  Ya'll can sure try calling my cell phone but I doubt I'll get reception in the middle of the devil's green hell of back woods Wisconsin.  Anyways, I'm looking forward to the next couple of days, cause I get to hang with my friends before I leave.
List of people I need to spend time with:
Chris
Alex
Jack
Kristin
Amanda
Trevor
These are the key kids, plus I also must talk to my dad about the new cell phone, because it would be pretty ducky to get it when I get back.  Who knows?  So anyways, good day thus far (thanks Chris)  But now I think i'm gunna go and work on something.  Yeah I don't know what that would be either but oh well.  Hit me up kids, if you wanna chat or hang before I leave.  And my random question of the day:  How is every guy I know at football practice or at work right now?!?!?!?!?!?!"

"event","Updating this, because i've gotten pretty bad at it, and Chris said that I should.  So interesting last couple of days.  I went and saw my dad, step mom and little brother.  I have mixed feeling about this.  I feel bad for him that he has them as parents, neither of them have any idea what they are doing, due to the fact that the kids they both already have they never once took care of.  Then I have this feeling of jealousy because my little brother gets so much from my dad that I never got, and not just material things.  Like, I'm glad that he is getting everything that he deserves but my dad never paid for my schooling, gone to my sporting events, ANYTHING!  I felt so unloved and deprived and now I see how he is with Evan and I feel like maybe I wasn't good enough for him.  Stupid I know, but I can't help feeling that maybe he didn't pay attention to me because of something I did.  I don't know.

So now on to better and more fun things. Chris!  I love him soooo much, he keeps me sane.  I haven't had a chance to talk to him the last couple of days, and I missed him, but he's worth whatever wait.  We have ridiculous amounts of stuff in common and he's soo amazingly sweet as proven in previous entries.  I'm talking to him right now and he just makes my heart melt, and I shall be seeing him soon(with caitlin apparently so she can yell at clay for not liking her) and never leaving his side ever!  But anyways, I love him.  And he makes all things better.  Yay for me!

Trevor, now this kid, I don't know what the hell is going on.  Says this ""ya know what.. youre the most perfect girl ive ever met.. im simply spoken, crazy about you... i dont mean to hurt you or be an ass.. i think higher o you than many people ive known from preschool... i simply wish i knew for sure that you were real.. ive been sitting here for a whole 5 minutes just looking at your sn.. and im sorry i geek so fast about stuff.. i just dont expect it i guess.. i love you i love you i love you.. sleep well.. youre beautiful.. dream pleasent.. youre amazing.. drouse nicely... youre everything any guy should ever want"" and then says he never wants to talk to me again.  What the FUCK?????  I mean he's a nice guy, a friend, that's it.  (Don't freak out Chris I WANT YOU!!!!)  I just don't know what the hell do, cause I want to be his friend, and he keeps wanting to not talk to me.

The situation with Clay has been resolved, finally, he's talking to me.  It makes me feel better, and less stressed!

Caitlin, miss her.  end of story HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVE!!!!!

yeah, leave comments you punks, otherwise there is no point for me to write this!"

"event","So interesting turn of events lately.  Alex, Miah, Clay and Chris, and Caiti.  Let's start off in alpabetical order for these situations.
    Alex.  God only knows what ever we were but now we are nothing, which is some cases is very good.  I don't think I care half as much as I used to about him, for the simple fact that he doesn't care two shits about me.  What a wonderful wake up call to life.  We always fought, we always hated each other, but continuously I went back for more hurt, like the retard that I am.  It's all done now.  We probably won't ever talk again.  Unless one day he is on drugs and decideds to call or im to say something completely ridiculous.  With all the bad stuff that happened, I'm still going to miss him a little.
    Caiti.  Again the fight about how she should be home.  She knows it.  Just doesn't feel like coming back.  All the people that want her back don't matter.  This next year is going to be so wrong without her.
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i'm so pissed your not here
LivingInUrLtrs: i wish i could just take you with me, like you could do this year here with me  
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and you should come back like you said you were
LivingInUrLtrs: i can't  
LivingInUrLtrs: maybe i should word that differently...i wont  
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: i know you won't
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: cause you can come home whenever you want
LivingInUrLtrs: im sorry  
LivingInUrLtrs: you deserve better...im being selfish
That was our conversation.  Enough has been said on this topic though.  She knows how I feel.
    Clay and Chris.  Wonderful guys.  I met Clay first, and I liked him.  He was wicked cute.  Then I called him one night and met Chris.  There aren't words to discribe how amazing this guy is.  6 hours we were on the phone and never once was it akward.  Nothing.  Now I have to choose  between them.  I know who I want, but I want my friendship with both of them.  Clay is sweet and adorable and my big pappa.  He's a boy who you constantly have to yell at to talk but who is gunna let me live in his car.  Chris is everything.  He's sweet, romantic, hilarious, caring, and my favorite battleship partner.  
Clay: your an awesome person, pretty, killer accent, and your just the type of girl that every guy waits for.... even though you live far away
Chris: you are always the topic that brings everything alive
Chris: and put a smile on my face
Chris: you are the te only thing i have thought about this morning
They both want me to be with the other though.
Clay: exactly... prove's my point that you like him, so i dont think we should talk anymore, because i dont wanna get in the middle of yall two
Chris: im not telling you to choose im telling you to talk to him and when things go wrong or yall just stop talkng i will be here
How do you respond to this situation?
    Miah.  He's back.  That's all there is to say about that."

"event","I haven't written in here in a long time.  There's so much to say, but I have no words, Jeremiah is semi back, and that is heart ache waiting to happen.  I can't get over him.  Just hearing his name, makes me fall in love all over again.  I don't know what I want to do about him.  Alex, he's leaving, slowly.  We don't talk and when we do it's for about 2 minutes before he hangs up on me.  I can't stand loving him, but it hurts when I don't have him around.  I want to say something smart, something that will make everyone realize how much pain I go through for those who I love, those who don't even notice it.  I can't, because I'm just not that smart.  Happy birthday Sami!  I'm going back to my state of depression now.  Good night."

"event","I've spent the last couple of days with my friend Amanda, doing all sorts of crazy stuff.  We've driven all over this state and called kiss fm more times then I can count.  We started hanging out last Tuesday night, and I've been with her ever since.  I feel kind of bad because I know other people have called and wanted to talk or hang out with me, but I haven't hung out with her in almost a year and I miss her.  She lives kinda in the middle of no where, so it's easy for me to just space out and think here.  Mostly about all the shit that is usually bothering me.  Not having my best friend here to talk to.  Not ever knowing what Alex and I are, whether we are fighting, talking or if he even cares about me.  Where the hell my life is going.  It's all boiling down to pointlessness right now.  It's like if no one cares what's the point in trying.  I'm always there for other people but I always get yelled at when I'm not in a good mood, or do something I've always done and now it's wrong.  I've also realized that I'm very forgetable.  I'll call and start talking to someone I haven't talked to in a while or im them and they won't remember me at all.  I'm begining to think that if I just disappeared one day no one would really notice.  A lot of people around me have issues, like wanting to give up on life, just end it or they get mentally or physically abused.  I've never really been physically abused, but definately mentally abused, and I have thought about giving up so many times.  It's almost become a daily thought.  I could never do it.  But sometimes I wonder what the hell would people do if I just left one day?  Always being the shoulder to cry on leaves you in a bad situation cause you never see the persons face when yours is buried in their t-shirt.  No one remembers the person they walk all over while trying to get to someone else."

"event","So, I am kinda realizing that taking off for the entire summer has some draw backs.  Before I had school, and work, and friends to keep me busy, keep me from thinking and worrying about things.  However, now I have so much time on my hands, and so little to do, that I have been thinking about a lot of things in my life.  I don't exactly know what I'm doing.  I have no idea what I am going to do with my life.  In a year I'll be in Florida for school, hopefully if I get accepted into the program, but I'm not all to sure that I will.  I don't have very much confidence in my skills cause I don't think it really matters all that much to anyone around me, so I am finding myself caring less about it.  No one really knows or understand what I do, therefore it becomes be littled and makes me feel like none of it matters.  I don't have a drive to work at all.  I don't have a drive to do anything.  I wake up, and go tanning, then eat lunch, then chill online, then eat dinner, then nap, then chill online, then sleep."

"event","I'm kinda lost at this present time.  With certain people and with myself.  I am proud of very trivial things, and don't know much about my own life.

Caitlin: I want you to come home.  I don't know why your not.  I talked to your mom today and she says you don't want to come home because you don't want to hurt your dad.  You hurt your mom when you left here.  You went out there.  You grew up, made mistakes, and found the part of yourself you were searching for.  You told us you were coming home.  What do you still have out there?  You found out that you and Sean wouldn't work.  You and Mikkenna aren't friends anymore.  Why?  Why won't you just come home.  So what if you hate Pat Fredricks?  Everyone does!  Think about it.  Since forever I have pictured all the big social events and just hanging out getting ready to leave together, everything has always been with you.  If you didn't picture it that way then I don't know what to say.  Doesn't it seem not right?  I need you here.  Your my best friend.  You went out there and experienced all of these things that I wanted to experience with you.  Now, you've grown up and changed and I miss it all.  I miss being able to call you for no reason.  Please come home.  We all miss you.  Your family misses you.  Your friends miss you.  I miss you.

Alex: Doubt you'll read this but I just want to reiterate what I told you all last night.  All of those things you said to me hurt me more than you will ever be able to imagine.  No one has ever told me anything like such, especially the part about how I deserved my mom.  I'm sorry you don't want me to care about you.  No matter what though, I am going to.  Like it or not.  I know I can't always make you happy, but I try my hardest.  I just don't understand you.  You want people to care about you, and when you do have someone (me) you push them away.  I think what I want more than anything from you is to just tell me what I am to you.  Tell me you either meant what you wrote me in the bp: hey baby, im just sitting here on the phone with you and i wanted to tell you that i love you. i know that ive been stubborn about saying it and i said i didnt want to get attached. just hearing your voice makes me so happy and it makes me feel like im the most important person in the world.  Or stick with the go to hell, and that I'm a bitch and can be replaced.  Pick one, or create for me a middle ground and tell me what it is, because at this point I am so confused about everything and I don't know what to do with you.  I can't even have a good conversation with you because I don't know what to say.  Help me out, please!!

Then there is school.  I have no idea where I am gunna end up and that scares me.  I am so unsure of my future, and about myself.  It seems like I don't really matter to a whole lot of people.  I want to know what I am besides paintbrush and trucker hat.  Cause right now, that's about all I'm seeing."

"event","Alright so last night, had to most akward and crazy dream ever.  It was so crazy!  So here is how it happened, with minor details missing because you never fully remember your dreams.

So it starts out with me talking to my mom on how you drive to my friend Justin's house from my house, but for some reason he lived downtown near the Italian Commuinity Center, but in my dream that part of town was the ghetto.  So I guess I had to make a stop somewhere on the way to his house and I was driving there with my friend Shaun, from work, and some other guy.  Well, so we are driving and then all of a sudden we are standing on a street corner.  We start walking and at first we are just walking the streets, but then we walk into a building, but it's like a hospital from the 20's that looks like a house with all of these sick old dying black people all over the place.  Then we walk down the stairs to go back outside and we keep walking and then we come to a bridge underpass.  Now it's really late at night and it's dark everywhere.  So we start to walk under this thing and all of a sudden all these homeless people start latching onto us.  So we kick all of them off after we get out from under bridge and keep walking.  Then we get to a corner and Shaun recognizes the neighborhood and wants to stop by his guy's house.  So we then start walking down the street and get to this guys house and his entire yard is filled with snow, and everwhere else it's summer.  So we go up to the house and this lady in her like 30's or 40's comes out and starts yelling at us, how us young kids are ruining her business and how she's gunna show us.  So she goes back in her house and the other guy who was with us pulls out a gun and then the old lady come back and she has a gun and before the other guy has a chance to shoot her she shoots all of us and we all fall back off her porch and so I start to die, and I pull out my phone to phone my best friend Caitlin so I can say goodbye and so she knows that I'm dead and can tell my family and everything and then the lady shoots my phone away and then I die!

"event","Well, woke up yesterday morning at Caitlin's with the most sore neck I've ever had.  It hurt a ridiculous amount.  Saw that I got a text from Alex saying that I should call him if I was awake at 3:34.  I haven't talked to him since and I'm kinda worried but I don't want to call him because I tried talking to him on the internet and he wouldn't talk to me.  I think he's kinda mad at me.  So then me and Caiti chilled for a while and I watched tv and hung out online while she took a shower.  Then we headed outside for an hour to get more tan.  After that back inside to make sandwiches and watch some tv with her mom before they all left for dinners because they all had plans.  So Caitlin drove me home around 5:15 and I just chilled and watched tv.  Read some more of the book Caitlin borrowed me.  Then at 8 I started watching I love the 90's 92 and 93.  Always a fun time.  Hung out with my brother while I was watching it.  Somehow we got into a conversation about how I'm not attracted to black guys.  Which leads me to my next event lsat night.  I have already typed it out to enough people that I don't feel like typing it out again so here it is in aim form.
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: however my brother just walked in
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i am SOOO FUCKING PISSED at him
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so he comes up to me
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and is like my friend curtis wants to holla at you
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: < doesn't like black guys!
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so i'm like i'm online and on the phone
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: i'm not going anywhere
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and we had a discussion earlier in the night about how i don't like black people
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and so he grabs my arm and drabs me down stairs
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so i go down there
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and he says nothing to me
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and this other black guy is down there
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i'm like i'm leaving
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and he's like no your not
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and won't let me leave my own fucking basement
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so i'm like whatever so i am just standing there
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: on the phone c
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: cause i figure if i get off the phone then i'm complete shit out of luck
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so the other guy that won't let me leave runs into me
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and goes to give me a hug and i give him one back really quick
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and then he won't let me go
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and starts grabbing my ass
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and so then i leave 
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and they keep calling my phone to go downstairs
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i don't answer
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so my brother comes up here
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and is like your going in the hall
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and drags me out there
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: litereally
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i'm still on the phone
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so the guy who wouldn't let me leave was there
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i was like i'm on the phone
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so he takes my phone
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and is like she'll call you back
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and hung up on my friend
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and then is like tried putting his name tag on me and started feeling my boobs and when he felt that i didn't have a bra on lifted up my shirt
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: to look
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i'm like i've known you for like an hour
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i don't like you
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: get off of me
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i tried pulling my shirt down and such
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: but no luck
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: he won
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: so then he pushes me to sit down
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and starts putting his hand between my legs
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and then tried kissing me
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and then asked if we could be friends with benifits
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and then why my friend finally called back 9 minutes later
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: he started poking my side
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and boobs
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and grabbing my ass
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and i felt so dirty
YlowcrdsPinkPrep: and violated

Then I talked to Mike, my friend, not brother, on the phone.  I love him so much.  We were on the phone until like 8 this morning with about 2 hours of that us just sleeping.  We talked about everything.  He makes me feel better about things, especially all that, that happened.  But now I am done and feel hungry so I am gunna go make some lunch.  Try and forget about all this and stop feeling so belittled."

"event","Well, today I was productive, and it felt nice.  I went to bed at I am guessing around 3.  Woke up at around 4 and shut my computer down cause I was downloading music and having a half assed conversation with C.T.  I fell asleep with Alex, always nice.  Then I woke up again at 9.  Called and woke him up, got the not so happy for it to be morning Alex.  Finally got out of bed at like 9 and took a shower, it definately woke me up.  Then I bummed around the house for another like 2 hours because my mom is never on time leaving for anything.  Got to Caitlin's house at around 11:30 and then headed to the park.  Had a grand day swimming and tanning.  Got nice and bronze.  :)  Then went home at around 6:30 to Caitlin's house.  We chilled and ate dinner, then headed to the book store.  She picked up two new books, while I was trapped in the bathroom.  Oh, what an interesting story!  Lol, but anyways, got out of the bathroom and got to talk to one of Caitlin's NH friends.  That was 2 seconds of pure fun.  Honestly it was.  Promise.  So then we stolled by my house, picked up some goods.  Came back to Caiti's and burned me 13 cd's.  Good Shit!  Then I talked to my mom when she got back from hanging out with my aunt and talked to her about getting some money to go tanning tomorrow because it might rain outside and I need to keep up this tan I got started.  Then I told her how I wanted to possibly go out to NH for Caitlin's birthday and she told me that we would look into it.  So I'm MEGA excited about that one.  Now I am just updating ya'll on my wonderful day.  Before I go back to hanging out with my bestest friend for the last 72 hours she's here.  *TEAR*"

"event","I know you want me to be happy, but I don't think it's meant to be.  Everytime I do something I just keep getting hurt.  I got in a fight with Alex 2 days ago and it made me feel horrible.  That I had messed up with him.  No matter how horrilbe he makes me feel, no matter how contradictory he is, I'm the only one that feels bad.  So we talked yesterday, many times, and I thought we were better, I talked to him this morning and everything between us was fine.  Then I got on here.  His away message: im sorry ashley. please forgive me. i wish i had never done that, i didnt know how you felt about me and i now know how important you are.  Such a slap in the face.  He was right, he doesn't need me.  I am as indespensible to him as a paper plate at a picnic.  I really do give up on love now.  I am tired of being hurt over and over again.  Yesterday and this morning I spent 11 hours at my step dad's brother house.  We are usually only there until 2 in the morning, however this time it was 4.  Caitlin was suppose to go with me, but she didn't.  It was nice though, because I got to hang out with Brandon.  We played basketball until like 1:30 in the morning.  Then I sat there miserable for the next 2 and a half hours because my mom was to drunk to want to leave.  I can't stand her.  I think for the rest of the summer, I am just going to lock myself in my room, work on art, and work out.  I need it.  I need to eat though too.  I realized this morning that all this stress makes me not eat.  In the past 3 days I had a vanilla coke and hershey bar from the gas station and some propel water at the picnic thing.  I know it's bad, but I can't help it.  I am never hungry.  I constantly have a headache too.  My mom just came up to me too and yelled about me being on the computer too much, so this will most likely be my last post, not that it matters.  No one reads this.  But if there is someone who does, I am sorry, but I don't think I can be happy, everytime I try I fail, so thanks for sticking with me, but you can leave now.  It's not worth it, and neither am I.  Bye guys."

"event","I feel like I have messed up, my 7 minutes in heaven are up.  Two days ago, I was being jealous.  I admitt it, because I hate that I can't have more.  Now I am afraid, I ruined all that.  After I was jealous, I was just mad and frusterated.  Frusterated about a lot of little stupid things, so I was a bitch.  Now it seems like you push me away.  That I am nothing more than some random girl that you talk to.  You told me to never give up on love, but I fear that you have given up on me.  Don't give up on me.  I am sorry.  I am sorry that I was a bitch.  I am sorry that I wanted more.  I am sorry for every little thing I have done to ever make you mad or hurt you.  I can't stop thinking about you, because I am so afraid I have done something wrong.  We haven't said I love you in over 2 days.  Please, I love you.  Don't forget that.  Don't give up on me.  Don't give up on whatever we are.

come up to meet you
tell you i'm sorry
you don't know how lovely you are
i have to find you
tell you i need you
tell you i've set you apart
tell me your secrets
ask me your questions
oh lets go back to the start

running in circles
chasing in tails
heads of silence when apart
nobody said it was easy
it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be this hard
oh take me back to the start

i was just guessing
numbers and fingers
pulling the puzzles apart
questions of science
sciene of progress
the left speaker's loud as my heart
tell me you love me
come back and haunt me
all in a rush to the start

running in circles
chasing tails
coming back as we are
nobody said it was easy
oh it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it was so hard
i'm going back to the start"

"event","Well, comfortable day all around.  Woke up at 8:30 when Alex called.  That was fun; made me realize how much I hate mornings.  Talked to him until about 10, then just sat around watching tv and downloading music.  Then my momma got home and she took Mike and I around to do errands.  Then we decided to go out to eat dinner when Caitlin called.  So my mom asked if she wanted to come, and she did, so we met here there.  It was a fun time.  Caitlin and I were talking about how John Mayer was kinda old cause he's like 28, and my mom looked at us like we were crazy cause I 28 really isn't all that old.  So then I was like, well not really because with how old my step dad is compared to my mom and how young my step mom is to my dad I could technically date someone who is like as old as 32 or as young as 5.  So then I decided to make the comment that tomorrow I was gunna go up to seb's and hit on the 5 year olds in the pal program, by offering them suckers.  My mom couldn't stop laughing, which made it a whole lot better than the sex comment I made earlier in the day about how Alex wants her to buy my birth control.  That was interesting.  So anyways, now Caitlin is over, chilling because I needed an emergency make me happy girls night because my last journal where I actually wrote was ubber depressing.  So tonight, we chill and then Saturday night, who knows what time I'll be getting home because I have a family thing to go to but Caitlin's going and she is gunna drive down there so we will most likely be able to leave early, super sweet cause it's mega boring.  Then Sunday we might be leaving for the Dells.  That will be great fun because we would go to Noah's Ark, the largest water park in America!  Then spend the whole day there Monday and head home Monday night.  Caiti and I are ubber excited.  So, yeah, gunna head out to go take my shower and you bitches better comment I SWEAR TO GOD!!!!!"

"event","I can't figure out my fucking live journal.  I want to update it; I want to make it pretty and I can't.  I haven't worked out lately and I feel gross.  I haven't worked on art and I have no drive or inspiration to do so.  I keep writing these fucking things hoping someone cares enough and comments on it but no one does; or if they do they don't comment so it's like they never read it at all.  So if by some freak change you read this anyone comment even if you say hey I read this and stop complaining you whiney bitch; just FUCKING COMMENT!!!!  I suck at school and am not looking forward to being back.  I want my best friend here forever and she leaves in 8 days.  I don't eat a whole lot and I know that's wrong.  I have been stressed out major lately, and all I seem to do is think to much.  I have a wonderful boy, but I ask to much, or I expect to much in general.  I don't really ask anything of him, more so I just think it.  I want a fairy tale which will always be just that; a fairy tale.  I'm scared I won't get accepted into school.  Scared I won't find my true love.  Scared I will fail everyone around me even more so then I already have.  Just Scared."

"event","Did absolutely nothing today.  Nothing at all.  Woke up at 11:30, and called Alex to see if he was awake.  Didn't answer.  Went out to the frontroom, watched ubber amounts of tv.  Called Alex again to make sure he was awake for his hair cut appointment, which he was so I wasn't as worried.  Watched some more tv and made a pizza to avoid doing chores.  Mom got home and told us she would take us to Noodles for dinner cause she couldn't take him to the dmv.  Excited as fuck about that because I haven't eaten there in a while.  Not since I went with Jack and Sam and Caitlin and Britt and Katie.  That was a long time ago.  But Alex is going out tonight with friends.  It should be fun for him.  He can pimp out some ho's or something to that effect.  It's weird.  I know we can't be anything.  I want it though.  The more I think about him, the more I want the title.  Won't get it, but I can always have wishful thinking.  No one can take away hope.  I know how important I am to him, he told me he would chose me over a car, which I know to everyone in the world doesn't mean shit, but not Alex.  Cars are like his soul mate.  It means a lot to know that, but it still hurts knowing that he goes out and could meet someone and I would have no ground to hold.  I got nothing because we aren't anything.  We are more then friends, but nothing else.  It's confusing, but I'll deal.  This is the hardest part of being a girl because for a while we will be content with whatever we can get or have but in about 5 minutes we want more.

Then yesterday, again not a whole lot happened.  Sat around during the day and hung out with Mike.  Made some phone calls and then started working on some stuff for school.  Caitlin came over last night, took me to Subway.  I wanted it so bad.  It was good.  Then we made her cd.

Random fact that I failed to mention a while ago.  Got my test scores back; average.  Got yelled at for being nothing special.  Always fun."

"event","So Caitlin is mad at me, which Shannon and I figured would happen.  Everytime she comes home, or leaves there is always a fight.  Shannon and I headed down to Summerfest yesterday and it sucked so much.  Absolutely nothing to do, so we left.  Caitlin was going to meet us down there, so we called and told her we weren't there anymore and she was upset but didn't tell us.  Tried guilt tripping us into going back down there because now she would have to sit in her mom's booth for 5 hours, because with as big as the fest is she couldn't find one person to hang out with down there.  I feel bad for not being down there with her but I just didn't want to be down there.  I couldn't find my cousin and the seats for the Jet and Rooney concert were full.  No point.  I hate that we always get in a fight though, cause it's always about stupid stuff.  Stuff that doesn't even matter.  Shannon and I offered for her to hang out with us, but she couldn't because she wouldn't have a ride to her work party, but she drives.  She could have asked her mom for the car and driven herself.  I didn't want to spend another entire day down there, I already did that for the Dashboard concert.  I love her to death but I refuse to keep doing things I don't really want to do.  Yeah, I am happy she's home but I'm not going to do everything she wants just because she's home.  That's crap."

"event","Well, today something important kind of happened.  I saw my little brother Evan for the first time today.  I went down to the Summerfest grounds and bought my hat and walked around and then Shannon and I left and walked to Grand Avenue and ate some lunch/dinner at Applebee's.  So we tried calling her mom to get a ride out of down town, but she wasn't home, so we just started walking up Wisconsin Ave.  Caitlin tried calling me but I didn't feel my phone vibrate and then she called Shannon to inform us that the fire works that we wanted to go and see tonight weren't going to be going on.  It was nice of her, but we think she's mad at us.  So we get to Starbucks down by Marquette and I decided to call my Gramma to inform her that we didn't need to park in her drive way because it was close to Hart.  So she's like oh your dad's here hold on you can talk to him.  I'm like great (very sarcasticlly) so he gets on the phone and is like hi where are you? and I'm like I don't know I'm at 16th and Wisconsin.  So he starts freaking out about how I'm about to walk through the ghetto so he is like just stay on Wisconsin and I'm gunna come and get you, and take you home.  So I am like fine, cause I wasn't exactly liking the thought of the 5 mile walk home, although I need it cause I haven't worked out at all lately.  So Shannon and I go into Starbucks and holy shit, who's art work do we see on the walls???? Katie Phiffer.  So she gets her coffee and we head out.  Walking down Wisco. Ave. my dad comes to get us, so I'm all excited to go home and what does the bastard do?  Drives me to my fucking gramma's so I can see my little brother AND step mom, who I hate with a passion.  I was so pissed!  Seriously, I spent over 2 years avoiding her for a reason.  He's a cute kid, and when I saw him I felt bad.  One, for never seeing him, despite my feelings and two, that he has to have my dad and step mom as parents.  So then I go to Shannon's and start talking to Alex.  He was hanging out with his friend so Shannon and I colored my hair.  As it got closer to being done he got in a worse of a mood.  So as soon as my hair was done, Shannon took me home, and I tried to cheer him up.  It didn't work to well.  But he talked to another one of his friends, and she made him better.  So now, I get the happy Alex.  It makes my day better knowing that he's happy, but for the most part it sucked.  I mean, fourth of July and I didn't even get to see fireworks.  They are my favorite. :(

"event","Sitting here, with goosebumps because I'm cold, and I don't know what to do.  Someone out there needs me, and I can't be there.  I have failed.  I am sorry.  I have given my all but it didn't help.  I hoped to keep this person floating, realize a little something about life; that they are valued even if it doesn't seem like it, if not by a lot of people, by me.  I care, I love, I value.  It's not enough.  So know that if no one else is there, if no one else believes in you, I do.  I will miss you if you leave.  I will cry and hurt unmatchable amounts.  I LOVE YOU!!!!!"

"event","Hey kids, well was awake until about 6am today.  I just couldn't find a way to get to sleep, so after Alex fell asleep on me, which I love cause then I know he's completely peaceful.  So then I got online and bp'ed Alex, give him something good to read when he woke up.  So then I called Hudson, woke him up at like 5 in the morning his time and made him talk to me while I feel asleep, he's a good kid.  So then I thought I set my alarm to get up at 10 to talk to Alex before he works.  Well, that didn't work to well, so he called me as he was driving to work.  Talked to him, kinda got him to settle down from the drama with his mamma.  *thinks self is awesome for rhyming that*  So then he gets to work and I let him go cause he's late and everything.  I lay down for a little while, however I couldn't get back to sleep so I decided to get up and watch Bad Boys 2 cause he wants me to see that, well my brother decided to be a douche and take all of our dvd's with him fishing.  So I call his phone twice and he doesn't pick up.  So about 10 minutes later he called the house and my mom started talking to him, so I got the other phone and was like ""WHERE ARE ALL OF OUR DVDS???????"" and he was like ""I have them with me""  so I start freaking out and my mom starts yelling at me how I am irresponsible for not have asking for them before he left and all this crap.  It just makes me sick.  Seriously, I mean, like, he's the one who took the damned things.  And I decided that I was going to rearrange my daily schedule.  I was planning on seeing Jet and Rooney tonight at the fest, with my cousin Kristin and her friends and then Caitlin, but I seriously am so sick of being pushed and shoved around.  So my new plan is to get the money my mom is going to give me, go down to summerfest, get my John Mayer trucker hat, leave the fest, and kick it with some friends until harts fireworks at 9:30.  That or I'll come home early and be like I couldn't find Kristin and just hang with Alex, cause I know he's not doing anything and I love spending time with him.  He always makes me smile. :)  So anyways, speaking of random acts, my dad just called.  He called to wish me a happy fourth and to let me know that he was going out of town for a week.  He always calls to inform me of these things like I care, but before this he hadn't called me since before like June 9th, cause I talked to him while I was doing portfolio class.  I really don't understand him.  He tries to make himself an important part of my life but he won't let me have the one thing I want; seeing my little brother Evan without having to see my step mom.  Evan is now 1 year and a little over 2 months old and I have yet to see him.  Pretty sad if you ask me, but it doesn't really matter cause my opinion and feelings don't count much when it comes to my dad.  But now I'm off to shower.  Love you all, Me

Comment!!!! (Alex) and good job Caiti I'm proud!"

"event","Well, ordered subs, picked up Shannon, Lucy and friend, and drove down town.  All to sit there for an hour and a half in the pouring rain.  I was completely soaked.  The entirety of my pants and shoes and socks all dripping wet and sloshing as we walked back to the car and for the 6 lays of shirts I had on, 2 tank tops, 2 long sleeve shirts, a sweatshirt, and my blazer the back on all of them were wet.  Only my hair was semi dry because I was under an umbrella the entire time.  So we got home two hours after we left here and I stipped down to keep from getting sick with the drastic change my body has gone through in the past day and a half with weather.  So now I'm home and rested because Alex was still at work so I took a nap after entertaining him at work for a lil bit.  Now, I'm just sitting here talking on the phone with Hudson and waiting for Alex to get home so I can hang with my boy.

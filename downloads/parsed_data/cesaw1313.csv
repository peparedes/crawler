"event","I'm sitting in the library studying for toften he one test I have to get at lest a d on to get a d in the class and that is all i want to pass has said has that may be.  The girl whom I had a crush on for years got a boyfriend and i will always wonder what would have happened if i would have just asked her out. I am not saying we would live together forever but maybe we would have had one great date or maybe she would have said no,  I think about it now and realize that id she would have said no--Sarah or chirs would have gone to the bar and got tanked with me. At least came with me while I got tanked.  Which I did all sorts of drunkes Tuesday-Thursday.

I still don't have a job.  All my friends who are gradurating either do or are going to law schools or grad schools the few friends i have. I often get scared that I will not find a job or end up alone. ending up alone scares me more I know someone will hire me and i will be able to live in at lest middle classrooms for a while happily, more happily if i had someone to share my middle classrooms with.

Bringing me to my next point. their is the girl i may or may not like. It might be the loneliness i fell. I like her enough to find out if i lIKE LIKE Her but she is young-which does not bother me. I don't have cuts as seen by coffe shop girl so nothing will ever happen.  Then there is also the girl whom I see everyone on campus at the coffes shop at the gas station. She is pretty and has red hair that is mildy curly along with freckles on her face. I do not know her name,her age, even her eye color we have never been that close to each other. the thing is if i had guts or self-estemm i would at lest go talke to her about what. somthing lame-like asking her to watch my computer while i went to the pisser, i say bathroom or restroom, or somthing more classy then pisser, but i don't so i'll go back to studying and wondering about all three of them.

"event","I'm sitting in the libary where I make goals formyself. Than also procedd to never making them. Like add two pages and fix the paper.  I am still on the second paragraph.  Find a job, I looked on one website.  then i realize i wish i could just be a writer.  But I'm not good at it and everyone is a writer today with bloging ans such. I don't let anyone know about my livehourjouranl people know i write in a journal but i never let them see the journal, and when i do i know they can not read my handwritting.  
    I also have so my in my mind maybe in i clear i can do some real work.
1.I might fail school-i have never been this close to failing a class in college ever.  I have to graduate 
2. I have no Job and will soon be an unproductive member of society
3. i have so many thoughts-I might be brooke
4. I can not ask this girl i haved a crush on for years out-she might say not, I will regert this forever
5. I am losing my mind with so much work to do."

I've got a broken heart
I'm glad you're happy

Do you still miss me when everything is quiet in your room

Wipe off the tears I shed since I have been alone
Lay your head on my shoulder

"event","So, i was playing on the internet and listen to my Itunes when two things happened about four hours apart. 1st i got a note, via facebook, from this girl i traveled Europe with. Whenever we where up late on a bus or early and had nothing else to talk about we would fight over the meaning of Konstanie. Which started playing on my itunes and brought me to write this. I mean she said it was about his fuck buddy and she is still wrong and i said it was about his 1dt real girlfriend which it is, and then it mad me sad cause i started thinking about my frist real x girlfriend 


I can't imagine all the people that you know
And the places that you go
When the lights are turned down low
And I don't understand
All the things you've seen
But I'm slipping in between
You and your big... dreams
It's always you and my big dreams

From the couple times we talked i heard stories that i just fucked   up then i don't remember the last time i remember what my  dream was about.                  Sometimes I remember having dreams just nothing else but i had one. the only    times i remember having dreams are when they include her 


And you tell me
That it's over
But I can't stand here in a patch of four leaf clover
And your restless
And I'm naked
You've got to get out
You can't stand to see me shaking
No, could you let me go
I didn't think so

And you don't want to be here in the future
So you say
The present's just a pleasant
Interruption to the past
And you don't want to look much closer
Cause you're afraid to find out all the hope
That you had sent into the sky by now had... crashed
And it did because of me

I mean one of the last things that was said during our relationship was ""I like you, we just have no future together"" and that after it was over while we had a lot of fun and thats all we wanted 

And then you bring me home
Afraid to find out that you're alone, no
And I'm sleeping in your living room
But we don't have much room
To live

This is just ironic cause when i went home with her i sleep in her living room

And I had dreams that I would learn to play guitar
Maybe cross the country
Become a rockstar
And there was hope in me
That I could take you there
But dammit you're so young
But I don't think I care
And if I hurt you then I'm sorry
Please don't think that this was easy

And then you bring me home
'Cause we both know what its like to be alone, no
And I'm dreaming in your living room
But we don't have much room
To live

I still went to vist her three times affter we broke up. WHy? cause we didn't want to be alone.

Konstantine came walking down the stairs
Doesn't she look good
Standing in her underwear?
And I've been thinking, and I've thinking, no
But she's been drinking
And it doesn't get me anywhere

We fought over alchol so much when.where. what was right it was sad.

My Konstantine came walking down the stairs
And all that I could do
Was touch her long blond hair
And I was thinking, what I was thinking ya know
We've been drinking and it doesn't get me anywhere

she become more free and less self aware? when she drank so i would get her drunk. then fell bad about it just let her sleep all over me in very uncomftombale position for me, because i felt remorse for getting her drunk 

This is because I can spell confusion with a K
and I like it
It's to dying in another's arms
And why I had to try it
It's to jimmy eat world
And those nights in my car
But this time I'm alone, and I don't see those stars
I'm not your star?
Isn't that what you said
What you thought this song meant
You thought this song meant

we had a long inside joke about things in cars to any country song, or derks bently 

And if this is what it takes
Just to lie in my mistakes
And live with what I did to you
And all the things I put you through
I always catch the clock it's 11:11
And now you want to talk
It's not hard to dream
You'll always be my Konstantine

i fucked up and i have to learn to deal with sometime hopefully so. and every time the clock hit 11:11 or 4:44 i make a wish 

They'll never hurt you like I do
No, They'll never hurt you like I do
No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No

i hope no other boy can, well no i hope he can he jsut doesn't hurt like i did i mean out of the nineish months we dated i mader her cry at least twenty times that i remember, so there was probably more. i like to know how many weeks when we where together that she didn't cry. about shit i did or said or didn't do

This is to a girl who got into my head
With all these pretty things she did
Hey Baby, You know that you keep me up in bed
It's to a girl who got into my head
With all the fucked up things I did
Hey maybe baby, you could keep me up in bed
My Konstantine

she did keep me up in bed, and she still does now

Spin around me like a dream
We played out on this movie screen
And I said,
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you
Did you know I miss you

God, I miss you

she knows. and after we broke up we had a chat and i don't remember much about it. I member a couple things how we hugged at the end. How ""no you where a great boyfriend, you treated me like a queen. you will probably be the only guy to buy me flowers""

And then you bring me home
And we'll go to sleep but this time not alone, no no,
And you'll kiss me in your living room, oh
And you see, no, that I've been missing in my Living room
Cause this is what I miss, what I miss
We don't have much room
I said, does anybody need that room?
Because we all need a little more room
To live

Cause if you think about it i just want to go back to her room and that last quote i bite my tongue and changed the subject instead of asking ""if i was a great boyfriend why did you break up with me, or you didn't/don't desver to be treated like a queen, or something like that. your played mr sweet guy i'm sure lots of guys will buy you flowers your worth it.

My Konstantine

she's my konstantine"

so i won't tell anyone what i did on new years.  but lets just say as it got closer and closer and midnight this is all i thougt about.  so i left and watched law and order till i feel asleep. i thougth about how i should be over it. if there is anyway for us to get back together.  with will just mean that i next realtionship is already dommed to faill. how i've actully never kissed anyone on new years eve ever. then only time there was sombody i realy cared about and wanted to i wasn't able to be with her. i had to work and everthing so it sucked.  this semster will probarly suck like all. i just hope i'm able to one get into study aboord, second i hope i get a summer job in lansing to go with my intership and that my next trip to chicago and is as great as the last one."

Then Saturday was homcoming i got totaly wasted. It was great and me and this chick ,Emily, hit it off.  She was very very arttartcive and we shared alot of smokes and then i got her number, cause thats how I roll.  then i was leaving the game and would have been kicked out, cause i had a fifth of jack in my hoddie pouch, but i was leaving so the guy let me keep it.  Then i woke up four hours later without my gloves, hat, ID,or phone.  I found everthing but my phone.  So, That sucks big balls,  Then i went to pick up my car from my friends apartment and the clutch is fucking sucks 300 plus labor so like four hunder bones for that to be fixed. 
  However, chris let me use his car today to dive to east lansing pick-up my sister then go to the Lions-Bills game.

I don't think we will ever talk again. And its my fault.  Whatever i can just come here and do homwork and the everyother weekend cudle with brigette and then evulatnly we will make out and then hook up- then she'll get a boyfrined and i'll be all only till the breakup/ or i go to europue.  whatever - and there is this carrer fair and i'll go-with my luck she th ex and then not be able to funtion for hours and that is just so sad. this joural will be my new grilfrend i'll just till it everthing for the whole world to see if they want.  
  The sadest thing is she was my best friend.  That whenver i see couples i think aboout how happy they are and how happy we where for nine months and think about how most  of the time one of them  will get there life destoryed
  My roomate daves brother me alot. well actully all of them do today is the frist time of hven't herd about AKwhate the fuck ever in how long.  Thats only they talk about fuck it is just a stuip fake fratinry. Yet i'm using there carrer fair. But david brother me the most. He hits on all my female friends. He put a move on tammy when we where dating. I SHOULD HAVE PUCHED HIM WHEN I FOUND OUT i didn't becuse she moved to the other end of the couch. i was gone for the weekend. and she hates vioncle and i am in love with her but i think if he put a move on her again and she shriged him off she would ig he went for it agin i would punch him. Also when i had brigete over i was gone for like two minutes he hit on her. The way the night had played out it was kinda looking like i liked her with i kinda do -but i we me and her know it wouldn't work out- but still what nerve well whatever.  I hooked up with one more then anyone else has, he never will, and i never will again, but i have, and me and brigtee sleep together, no sex, jsut sleep and cudle and 
as the year goes on we will again and we wil makeout- she plans on do that somtime, so maybe i won't jsut so she'll want to more, and that might ruin our friendship."

I mean that what i want to do with my life is travel,  the tricky part will be find a way to make that a succefull living and make friends when i been gone all the f-time but i make them i sure i would. My aunt use to work for the un and has been literly everyone she has only NOT been to four countries and Anatrica whatever the hell that counts has.  That might be the inn i need.  Caused affter all its not what you know its whom you know so i figue that the more travel slash experince i get know i will have a better shot at getting this done.
   today my frined briggte asked me to go to her concert she play viola in  orchersta and we got out of hell lacrosse pratice we jsut ran for 45 minutes early so iwent.  She was exctied and gave me four two hugs and then a goodbye hug later.  She wouldn't go play pong with me she had to study and then i told her i was faling to classe or which i not but i have low grades and a 113 in econ 306 but she said she would never go out with me ubless i got my grades out..It might it sound as if it was a daing thing so i quickly interjected and sad for pong and that you never go out with me anyways.  then as i was about to leave we had a long stare and i thought about kissing her but i didn't.  I didn't want the check, i thought about tammy, anbd i don't want her, briggete and i her to go down that same path.  then i told her about the facebook ruine my life story whatever i gett tanked tommrow and not call the x.  Oh and i think this brigettte chick digs me becuse i then i procced to tell her how i can't move on- to another realtionship untill me and tammy are at least on speaking terms.  before i was done she said then call her or maybe i just want brigette to want to date me, to help my self esteem.  side note i work with proably the 4th hottest girl i ever met and become friends with not seen but know name and such.  so next time i have plans for affter work i'm asking her to go with me i think. but a no would be bad and aquired unless its a party case then you can throw out bullshit reason why not to go. she's smoking"

I mean that what i want to do with my life is travel,  the tricky part will be find a way to make that a succefull living and make friends when i been gone all the f-time but i make them i sure i would. My aunt use to work for the un and has been literly everyone she has only NOT been to four countries and Anatrica whatever the hell that counts has.  That might be the inn i need.  Caused affter all its not what you know its whom you know so i figue that the more travel slash experince i get know i will have a better shot at getting this done.
   today my frined briggte asked me to go to her concert she play viola in  orchersta and we got out of hell lacrosse pratice we jsut ran for 45 minutes early so iwent.  She was exctied and gave me four two hugs and then a goodbye hug later.  She wouldn't go play pong with me she had to study and then i told her i was faling to classe or which i not but i have low grades and a 113 in econ 306 but she said she would never go out with me ubless i got my grades out..It might it sound as if it was a daing thing so i quickly interjected and sad for pong and that you never go out with me anyways.  then as i was about to leave we had a long stare and i thought about kissing her but i didn't.  I didn't want the check, i thought about tammy, anbd i don't want her, briggete and i her to go down that same path.  then i told her about the facebook ruine my life story whatever i gett tanked tommrow and not call the x"

"event","so i broke down and called her last night. i didn't want to be i had to and it was a terrbrl call
<BR> i realize where not getting back together anytime soon, if ever tear. that upsets me but there are some reason
1. ilm to messy for her. she has a point and i want to be less messy
2. i don't care, i don't and i should
3. she just doesn't want any boy rigth now, so i need to give her some space and she did say that whenver she thought of how i was a bad bf she compare me to her ex and i blew him out of the water.  So, hopefuuly she'll compare her next bf to me and i'll win.
4. i have trust issue- this last two will be the hardest
especly because i'm heartbroken right now. and she still wants us to be friends ""better then most of my friends"" she told me last night. so  i think thats what its at for now. and if my fellings for her don't change by thanksgiving time, i'll jsut tell her and she if she's up for trying again, and if not then i'll have to take some time away from her. this hold situion is just horrible and i mean i'm only twenty hav eno long term plans for anything right now. i just know that she owes me a kiss and a cuddle and i can't wait, but have to till august"

Then went out fro breakfast and affter when she was leaving i got a nice long embrance with the head on the shoulers and we kissed, it was great. I don't know what is going on woth us, we fight, we talk, we kiss, i love her dearly.
<BR> then yesterday i was going out to a party and she wan't me to call her when i got back. i think that is love or very close to it,  imean how many people want you to call them when you get back from somwhere safly
   Then on tuesday night she is going to the bar. with one of her friends you use to have a huge crush on her. this i am worried about.  i mean when she gets drunk she gets friendly, but doesn't everyone.  so i just hoping nothing happens. i mean i know where broke-up so it could. but it would brother me. more then if it was a differnt kid. this kid was mean to her and such and she would barly talk to him for awhile. so i mean its nice that she can frogive, because i know if we ever get back togeher she'll have to forgive me of alot. but at the somtime i just don't like him. he knows this about her and is very desperarte for a woema. I just hoep that nothing happens and do show her that i don't worry. becaus  i worry to much and i know it, if i worried less i think it would help me in genral, and help me and her, become what we where a cute, happy, couple that was in love. so i won;t ask her to call when she gets back, i'll jsut have her tell me about it on weasday, anyways she's suppose to call tonight, so we can finallise are new york plains,. and maybe i can get some more insight into this bar thing"

Even since she is just an hour away. the main reason i didn't get to see her is because her family is to fund of me, they have there reason. i can even understand some of them.  What makes me mad is tommrow she stopping by and i get to see herm but just for like an half hour tops.
<bR> That doesn't make me mad.  This does. She has her own car and could have left tonight to see me longer. the reason she has to go home is to get  a nap in befor she works her six hour day. That i can understand to. she's been busy all week.  However she knows she can sleep on her old places couch. Is more then welcome at my place. She could have either of our couches, or even my bed.  I guess i'm just that impornat to her anymore.
<br> What makes me mad is i called her to be mad. Tell her that if i'm not worth her take some time out of her day then i guess she can just go back home without stopping. I was able to get  a jab in out her family out if it was ok if i came in aug.  Becuase where going to a tigers games, hopefully.  i don't think she caugt, i hope she didn't, now that i think about it.  I just hate how i was mad at her and couldn't be mad at her. i jsut hope everthing works.  Either we get back together or i get over her. I mean i think over time i will, However you hear old people talk about the one that got away, or the wish the could chage to get back. I don't want that."

<br> i think i will play things the cool way. by either today or tommrow when we talk till her that she doesn't have to see me.  That if she wants to get on her way home i understand becuae of tghe traffic and such.  also i might tell her that she should see linday or lancey or her frien dben.  becuase she gets to see me in a month and then three weeks later fro an entrie wee.  that i was part of the reason she and ben never hung out.  they used to be make-out buddies,  but they stop whever either one of them got a bf/gf.  becuas ei have trust issue and would have flipped out if she saw him. hopefulyy she'll say sumthing about how she doesn't want ben to be make-out ben anymore
<br> agin with my sick and twisted mind.  that maybe she'll she make-out ben and start to talk and then cuddle and then start to make-out. then stop realizing she still has felling for me. which she does as i do her"

   So, my life has been very complexed lately.  Me and my girfriend. well ex-girlfriend just broke up. The thing is there are alot of reason and none of them are that good.  Excpet we weren't happy with each other anymore.  So we sora brok up for a week.  Then realy broke up.  However, we've talked every day since.  Somtimes for hours other times for minutes. Last night we where talking and she said well to you want us to date again and i said no.  Which is werid becasue i;m still in love with her. Maybe i don't like her as much as i think. Better maybe i love her so much to realies  she not happy with me as her boyfriend and to let her go. Becuase if you truerly love somthing let it go and if it loves you it will come back.  
   Two make things worst, or better.  We have in the week since we broke up.  Planned a trip to New York. One of the reason we broke up was she is gradtuing next year and has a job lined up in south carilona.  She can't do distance, she tried and failed.  thinks it her fault.  I'm not sure it is.  i be willing to give it a try.  
 This could be a good thing. Neither one of us has dated many other people.  In a way i know she wanted to.  i think i do too.  I know that will compare all my future realtionships to this one  Since she compared to me her last BF, she will compare her next one to me. I hope ones affter that as well. Becuase that will mean she still looking for someone better at loving her then me.
   In a sick and twisted and maybe wrong way.  i want her to date others.  have fun and have a couple long-term over half a year realtionship and everthing that goes with that.  as i hope i do.  That we both find sombody that makes us forgert about the other one; or we get back together.
   I never been as close to anyone, ecxept my sister (maybe), as i am to her.  I just hope that we will still cuddle next."

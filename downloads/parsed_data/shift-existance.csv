It's amazing how when you're at home you can spend countless hours on the internet..Looking at porn, reading about corrupt politicians, viewing funny comics, watching midgets fight over a beer..But at work when emails goes down and all you can think to do is sit and be bored."

"event","Wow. It's been a long time since I've written here or anywhere else. All this time has passed and I can't think of a single thing to say. 

Ah. This.

For 2 years I have not seen my daughter. That's right. For half of her life I haven't been there at all. Yes, I know I should feel horrible about this and I do. I even ran away from everything. I packed up and left and went and was gone. I think about her all the time, and her mom too. I care more for them than anything else I've ever known, and it still isn't enough. I don't think I really realized this until very recently, when I saw Marlene and Madison for lunch. Let me start by saying Madison is incredible. I've never smiled so much and felt so overwhelmingly good inside as I did for a few hours this week, when I got to eat with her and talk to her and look at her. She astounds me with her clarity, her comprehension, her vocabulary. (Which beats the shit out of the vocabularies of some people I know 5 times her age) Since this day I think I'll be able to see her alot more often, and Marlene too. I think she sees that I'm more open, patient, accepting...and less volatile than I used to be. I think for the first time in years she can trust me. 

I feel kind of opened up. Like a long awaited breath of fresh air after spending too much time under water. 

There is so much more to this, but so revealing. I think I'll keep it for myself."

"event","My job is a horrible joke. I work for a company run by some ex republican senators and congressmen. We kiss the righteous ass of Ed Gillespie and fill his coffers with plundered money sweet talked away from old men and women who count on our government for everything. These are people that worked hard and paid taxes their whole life under a false sense of security. A portion of what the elderly on social security recieve monthly from their government is practically begged back out of them by numerous republican organizations, all set up with a different name, but all going to the same greedy GOP. I am a bleeding heart liberal. Hell yes we should take care of the old and down-trodden. Hell yes we should work hard as a united group to bring up the poor, the uneducated, the under privaleged...If a portion of my earnings can go to use in welfare programs that will someday level the social playing field in the US and breach the gap that seperates the poor from the rich then I'm all for it - We are in a steady decline as a country people. If nothing changes, and fast, our future is bleak. I'm not talking about our foreign policy, which is definitely another reason for alarm - and I could go on about that for hours without end. I'm talking about the USA. What you see every fucking day as you wake up, go to work, go to school, see the RICHEST COUNTRY on earth living in poverty! Meanwhile our leaders strive only toward their own agenda - which I assure you isn't our well being. These men, sitting proudly in thrones built by the sweat and tears of the american worker are only looking at the economics of our country. They only understand one language, and that's mathematics. People who fought in honorable wars of the past are no longer looked after by the country who's ideals they risked their lives to preserve. George Bush won the christian demographic in the 2004 election - duh. This man is the anti-christ! He's leading our country closer and closer to the edge in so many ways and so many older people are PROGRAMMED to blindly follow. I love when I call someone who's smart and questions our leaders, someone who's pissed abotu the GOP wholeheartedly funding Arlen Spectre to take the place of Tom Daschle! Republicans hate Daschle, but the smart ones are at least pissed about his predecessor. Arlen Spectre isn't a true republican. He's a man who can be bought, as his wavering opinion demonstrates. Spectre took over only so he could support Bush's plans for the Supreme Court. This is the first time in 80 years that we've had a republican president and a republican majority to congress. The Republicans are ousting the Democrats! It's almost a hostile takeover! Instead of guns however we use money and influence. Instead of armies we use brainwash. Bush is installing through his various contacts a very pro-Bush government that is NOT concerned with you or your life. You are but a single digit in a number that's infinite. The GOP has a huge surplus after the election, we lie daily telling supporters that we are in a 1.2 million dollar deficit after our noble battles through this past election cycle. My job encourages me to bend the truth in order to gain a dollar. The worst part is I'm very good at it, and out of necessity do a decent job even though I try not to. I'm scared for our country. We've gotten to large for ourselves, just like Rome. This cannot go on indefinitely, and on our current course I feel this house of cards will fall very, very soon. I see lies and half-truths everywhere I look from the people who we have given the power to make our decisions for us. I'm drunk and frightened."

"event","I want to write about someone I respect more than anyone else in the world. If I had to name a hero, it would be this kid. My little brother Tom. He's the kid in school you didn't know until he stepped up and helped you out of getting your ass beat by whomever it was in your school that gained his reputation beating asses while all your friends stood idly by, too paralyzed with fear to help you out. He's the gentle giant, and if his neutral expression wasn't so friendly you would be intimidated standing before him. Don't be fooled though, just because he's outwardly friendly, helpful, intelligent...that does not mean he can't beat some asses when the situation calls for it. 
I just spent 2 hours on the phone with him in Fort Bragg, NC. I'm surprised that despite my faults my brother still holds me in the greatest of lights, respects my mind if not my actions, and has great faith in me for the future. It's especially refreshing when everything else you hear from friends, peers, parents is negative or apathetic. He gives me strength and clears my vision when my eyes have become clouded. This kid is a great pillar of strength physically and mentally, and easily overlooks the faults in everyone he meets...I think he got different genes than me. I am cynical and cold and unforgiving and mean and uncompromising. Go me! 
Anyway, just wanted to say thanks to my bro, and all the people in my corner."

"event","Early in the AM after absolutely no sleep my thoughts are either lucid or blocked. I really should have slept due to the fact that I have an interview for a new job in about 2 hours. I currently live in At Paul, Minnesota. Since I moved here in July I haven't done much of anything, but that's par for the course I guess. I'm not sure what my problem is...I spend countless hours lying awake all night thinking about what's stopping me. It's internal. It's a self-erected wall built to stop anything from getting in or out. I'm amazed at people's accomplishments because I can't even get past my own inner struggle. My goal in moving here was to get my feet on solid ground and focus my gaze far ahead of me, where I'd like to be. Mostly all I've done is reflect on the bridges I've burnt, the people I've hurt, the things I've forced myself to miss. The ones I love who wont talk to me anymore. My attention instead of looking toward the future is locked on the past. 
I wish I could make amends for all the things I've done wrong and heal all the people I've hurt. I see within myself such great potential, but it's locked away somewhere where I can't reach it. I'm a self serving individual by definition of my actions, but my nature is such the opposite. I'm happiest when I'm building for someone else. I'm content only when what I have can be given to who I love. 
Isolation only makes this wall stronger. I need to get out. 

Anyway, I have plans. They may finally be starting to take shape as reality. I'm working, saving, sober, alive. I am coming home to Salt Lake on December 27th and staying for 7 days. I look forward to seeing my freinds and family again after losing the chip that's been imbedded in my shoulder. I only hope they can forgive and recieve me well. Long term plans?? Save even more, come home permanantly in July and start a real life. I want to get married, buy a house, own a friggin RV, build something for my children so they don't have to start from scratch. Starting from scratch sucks. I've been looking into grants for college, something I should have started doing about 6 years ago. I've been working out regularly, being relatively healthy other than smoking. Ugh. I'm afraid of going home and resparking my romance with drugs, one former lover I'd just as soon forget about. These thoughts are all randomly and put together haphazardly, so for anyone who may come across this and waste enough time to read it..sorry. 

One more thing...I wish I could share this city with someone special. It's so big and new and beautiful it's almost a shame to go at it alone. Being in the city all alone reminds me of how absolutely alone I am. Maybe being alone is good for a person sometimes, but that doesn't mean they have to like it."

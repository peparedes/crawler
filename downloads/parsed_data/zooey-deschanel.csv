Abandon came out yesterday and it's getting mixed reviews. What do the critics know anyway? I made a quick stop in at Jay Leno during the week to promote the movie. I got to meet Greg Kinnear. He's like amazing and really handsome in person. I was such an idiot on the show. The public is probably wondering now how I'm able to feed myself with utensils. I just get so nervous. I mean, I don't want to look stupid but in the end, it makes it worse. Oh well. What else have I done? I guest appeared on Frasier. That was a really interesting experience to say the least. 

Alright, I'm tired of typing now, I'll elaborate on some other things in a later entry. Oh, and before I go, how come no one told me <lj user=""charlie_hunnam""> got a journal?!"

"event","I know it's been about a month since I've updated. I just haven't had the need to come online but here I am. I know you're all sighing with relief. Well, maybe not. A girl can dream though. 

Hmm, so what's new? I was in <lj user=""jimmy_fallon"">'s music video. That was fun and interesting. I especially loved dressing up in all these weird outfits. Not a big change from my personal life though.

Um, I just finished wrapping Abandon with <lj user=""katie_holmes""> and <lj user=""benjamin_bratt"">. I played her roommate in the movie. I'm kind of afraid now of becoming labeled the ""sidekick"" chick all the time. I mean, that's pretty much all I play. It has it's good points though. All the attention isn't diverted towards me and I play pretty likable or scene-stealing characters."

"event","Go see The Good Girl. I'm in it, as well as some other fine thespians such as <lj user=""jake_gyllenhaal""> and <lj user=""j_aniston"">. We've been doing promotion like crazy. I don't read the reviews much so I really don't know what the critics and public have been saying. I really don't give a shit anyway. All I know is that we all had a great time making the film. Well, at least I did."

Hey, I'm Zooey. You might have seen me lurking around such films as Almost Famous, The Good Girl, The New Guy, and Mumford. I have yet to become a household name. Be nice to me and I'll be your best friend. Make me icons and I'll take you out to dinner. Buy me a paid account and I'll . . I won't finish that sentence. Use your imagination."

The really most most most important<br>for you is that she/he is romantic. You love it<br>to get love letters, red roses and be in a<br>romantic atmosphere. He/She must make you think<br>that you are the most beautiful of all. When<br>he/she is romantic she/he has you got in his<br>hands. When he/she tells you all that he/she<br>feels for you ,you are devoted to him/her. At<br>this point you are easy to be tempt. Your heart<br>is soft and pure and you would never cheat as<br>long as you love your partner. But if he cheats<br>you, you are not hiding your feelings and show<br>how much she/he hurt you because you trusted in<br>him/her and never thought he/she could do this<br>to you.PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you<br>think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You<br>can always message me or tell me how I can<br>improve that quiz.

why would you keep liking someone if they didnt like you? 
why would you keep trying to get the person if they don't like
 you for who you are?there will be more....why waist your time 
when you won't ever get them? if the one you like doesn't like 
you for who you are, then why waist your time?

ME
i sit there in a corner rocking back and rocking back and forth as i sit there i am thinking to myself i got problems, can't fix them, when will i die i don't know why,i cry for 2 hours rocking back and forth, rocking back and forth, i hear the wind blow, i feel blood dripping off of my head, i smell a man in my room, i look into my mirror and i see a man just about to stab me in my heart i move a litttle but not enough and the man stabs me in my heart, i gush out with blood, i am dead, i am dead.

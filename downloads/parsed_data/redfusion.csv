"event","<B>The Egg Project</b>

I made all-day eggs today:

Starting with cold eggs, place them in boiling water and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Leave them for six to eight minutes depending on the size of the egg.  Because my stove is frustrating and I had trouble getting the water to come back to a boil after the cold eggs brought it down, these cooked for 7:30.

Immediately place the eggs in an ice bath with <I>lots</I> of ice.  I didn't use enough ice, and it melted very shortly after the eggs were added, which meant that the yolk stayed warm.  The idea is to cool the eggs down fast enough that although the white is hard-boiled, the yolk stays soft -- even runny, if you're on the short end of the window.  I was aiming for runny; between the 7:30 boil time and the insufficient ice, I didn't get it.  (Keep reading, it turns out I am happy with what I got.)

Leave the eggs in the ice bath for 3-4 hours.  Peel them and put them in a marinade.  It's worth noting that although these eggs were fresher than I usually care to use for hard-boiled eggs, they peeled just fine after a morning-long ice bath.

The traditional marinade is one part soy sauce to one part water to half part sugar (I used maple syrup, I'm out of sugar), with an addition of dark soy and slices of ginger.  I made one batch of that, and one batch of spicy marinade: one part Louisiana hot sauce to one part water, bolstered with Marmite and maple.

Leave the eggs in the marinade for 3-5 hours.  Afterwards, they look like this:

Inside, they look like this:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktepi/1367821611/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1054/1367821611_e138e8aba6.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""INT. Eggs - Day"" /></a>

The white picks up some of the taste of the marinade, but not enough to ""pickle"" it, which I was a little afraid of.  You do get a distinct vinegar taste with the hot sauce eggs -- a little less than what I hoped pickled eggs would taste like, in other words far far less than what they do taste like.  The spice is not as strong as I expected; next time there will be booster shots of habanero.

With the soy sauce eggs, the ginger is prominent (I used fresh, which may have something to do with it).  I don't taste any maple in either egg, or any particular sweetness, so I don't know how necessary it is.

But here's the thing.  Look at the yolk.  It looks like an underdone hard-boiled yolk, the kind of thing we hate to find when we're making deviled eggs -- it looks like it should be chalky on the outside, rubbery on the inside ...

... and oh my God is it not.

This is unlike any egg yolk I have had.  It's unctuous.  It's creamy.  None of the chalkiness of a hard-boiled egg, even on that edge there where it sure as hell looks chalky.  None of the runniness of a fried egg either, though.  It's its own thing.  It's ... it's like the pork belly of egg.  This is awesome."

"event","I asked about this on eGullet, but I'll ask here too:

Has anyone slaughtered and cleaned a mature hen?

My mother has two dozen hens that aren't laying anymore, and told me I can have any of them if I ""take care"" of them myself -- killing and cleaning them.  I'm good with a knife, and I can get a duck down to its constituent parts in a couple minutes, but I've never had to eviscerate or de-feather anything.

Mature poultry is really only good for braising, and judging from the many roosters I've cooked, the breast meat isn't even good for that.  So it's not a <I>bargain</I>  exactly -- there'd be a lot of labor for little meat.  Though it is still meat I won't find elsewhere -- it's perfect for coq au vin, which I don't bother to make anymore since I don't have an Asian market I can buy rooster from.

If I pass on this, am I missing out?"

"event","I made a big batch of feijoada, the national dish of Brazil.  It's not fully authentic, particularly in its presentation (no farofa, etc), but I've never cared much about authenticity, and food cares even less.

<lj-cut text=""Many photos; click to enlarge.""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktepi/1131679456/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1333/1131679456_6367ebba05.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_2132"" /></a>
Prep: green pepper, garlic, onion, garlic scapes, linguica (a Portuguese sausage; I'm not a hundred percent crazy about this brand, but it's what I can get), spare ribs.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktepi/1131679486/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1281/1131679486_802cc2de0d.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_2133"" /></a>
Prep: Pork tails and smoked pork hock pre-cooking in simmering water.  Feijoada is made with virtually all of the pig, and traditionally uses fresh, cured, and smoked pork.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktepi/1131679494/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1345/1131679494_e1d46f0122.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_2134"" /></a>
Prep: Black beans.  Forget about soaking.  Russ Parsons disproved the soaking myth ages ago.  You don't need to soak beans and you can season and salt them right from the start as long as you don't add anything acidic like molasses or tomatoes.  Bringing beans to a simmer, covering them, and putting them in the oven for 60 to 75 minutes will cook them fully.  In this case, that's what I did before continuing -- though I could have opted not to precook them, I did while the pork pre-cooked.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktepi/1131679496/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1370/1131679496_0713259430.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_2135"" /></a>
Combining the meat and the beans, with some added broth.  As you can see, the Dutch oven is very full.  I could have used fewer beans, but wasn't very particular.

Everything goes back in the oven at a low heat for a few hours; the vegetables get sauted briefly.

Cracklins are really good with rich bean dishes, so here's a pot full of water and pork skin; the simmering water cooks the skin before it cooks off, and the skin fries out in the fat that remains.

The finished feijoada.  A lot of times the meat will be kept whole; I let it break up, and fish the bones out.  Notice the difference between how it looks here and (if you can tell) how much thicker it'll look when it's plated.  It didn't cook further -- that's just from sitting for a few hours and being reheated, it thickened up when it ""set.""

This is the fond left in the pot from cooking the cracklins.  We'll return to it some other day, but I'll tell you right now that it's going to be used as the foundation for the sausage gravy in biscuits and gravy.

"event","I don't think this is of any particular use to anyone reading this, but a friend getting her first apartment asked me for advice about cooking for yourself affordably, so to sum it up --

Stop buying boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Where I live, they're the same price as steak, literally three times the cost of chicken on the bone, for the luxury of someone else's thirty seconds of labor.  If I can't talk you out of cooking white meat, at least stop overpaying for it.

The best bet, really, is to buy a whole chicken.  It only takes an hour to cook, only two or three minutes of which require any attention from you.  Cold chicken is better than cold beef or cold pork, and you can make chicken salad, chicken sandwiches, chicken soup, chicken fried rice, during the week.  It'll cost you about the same as lunch at Taco Bell.

Stop being grossed out about food.

Stop being grossed out about food.

Stop being grossed out about food.

You can't be an adult if you can't cook, and you can't cook much if food makes you say ew.  Most people think raw chicken is weird to handle at first, but you get over it quickly unless you continue to indulge in the revulsion.  It just isn't a big deal.  If food grosses you out, you'll wind up spending more paying other people to touch it for you than you are on the food itself, even if you're not eating out -- and that's just ridiculous, especially for anyone on a budget.  This is why so many people rely on unhealthy things like Hot Pockets for their fast cheap meals -- they don't require premeditation or physical contact with ingredients.

Stop thinking in terms of recipes.  If you think in terms of recipes, you won't get past ""oh I can't make that because I don't have X.""  Take some of that leftover chicken and toss it in the pan with leftover rice, soy sauce, and whatever vegetables you have around.  Don't skip fried rice just because you don't have any eggs or onions.

When you're first starting cooking, perceived time-consumption will be greater than once you're used to it, and you'll come home feeling unmotivated and will wind up ordering pizza or eating ice cream.  Either fight that for a few months, or shift as much of your cooking to the weekend as possible, and get over any reluctance about eating leftovers.  Making something like a chicken -- as opposed to a pot of stew -- is an especially good thing because it's flexible, you can do multiple things with the ""leftovers.""

Stop being grossed out by food!  Given the speed with which some people abandon leftovers, you'd think that cooking actually reduced the shelf life of food.

With the exception of lasagna, Asian noodle dishes keep better than Italian pasta dishes.

Learn to make soup, because it's pretty easy to make a single serving of it.

Rice poisoning is not uncommon.  It's caused by bacteria which thrive in cooked rice left at room temperature for long periods.  Don't leave your pot of rice on the stove overnight -- put it in the fridge.

Keep rice, noodles, a bag of frozen peas, a sauce of some kind, and Zip-Loc freezer bags on hand.  The best way to buy meat is to buy the ""family packs"" (when applicable) and redivide them among the Zip-Loc bags, freezing everything you aren't going to use the next day.  The bags are handy for leftovers too.

Like I said, this is probably all obvious to anyone reading this."

The problem: the eggs stuck to the bag!  I peeled one off so I could show you the extent -- where the egg sticks, it's like an overcooked fried egg, unsurprisingly.

"event","<B>Savu Smoker Bags</b>

The deal with these is that they're heavy foil bags with wood chips (and ""hardwood syrup and natural sugars"") in the lining, so that you put food in the bag, seal it, put it in a very hot oven to get the smoke going, and let it smoke for a while.  No smoke sets off your alarm, the food cooks, bingo.  They're single-use.

It looks like you can fit about two, two and a half pounds of food in the bag comfortably.

This is essentially an oven bag + smoke, which means you're steaming the food -- instructions for chicken call for removing the skin, which would just come out flabby and rubbery otherwise.  That's a major limitation, but for some things it won't matter.

I got four bags.  I want to try a variety of different things -- like what happens if I fill a bag with chili?

<B>Bag One:</b>

<B>1 ear, corn on the cob</b>

Nicely smoky.  Tasting it, you understand why they warn that smoked foods are carcinogenic -- this tastes pleasantly bad for you.

It's a little overcooked since corn really doesn't need to cook as long as the other items, but that's not a big deal.

<B>Hot Italian sausages (uncooked)</b>

They're so hot that the smoke flavor is very light, but it's there.

<B>1 hot dog, skinless</b>

No real noticeable smoke flavor, despite being the smallest item in the bag.  Is it because of the mild smoke flavoring in hot dogs?  Is it because hot dogs are already cooked?  I don't know.

So far: This is a pretty light smoke -- the kitchen smells smokier than the food tastes, though there's no visible smoke around -- but the smoke is definitely there.  The steam issue means this will be a very different process from a barbecue pit, or even a home smoker -- but I'm looking at it as potentially analogous to the Bialetti Moka: it isn't espresso, but it certainly isn't plain coffee either."

"event","I had slow-cooked pulled pork for dinner.  This is the only time of year I can find skin-on cuts of pork here, so you better believe I take advantage of that -- cooked skin-side-down, at the end of ten hours the skin of the pork picnic was unctuous and rich from the fond at the bottom of the pan.

This is a fatty cut of pork, so I like a very vinegary sauce.  This was very very simple, but worked perfectly:

1 part ketchup
1 part cider vinegar

And then smoked maple syrup and Crystal hot sauce, in equal proportion, until it tasted as spicy as I wanted it to.

The ketchup is just to thicken it enough that the bun doesn't get soggy -- this isn't a molasses-y tomatoey barbecue sauce, this is very vinegary.  You wouldn't want it on chicken, I don't think, except maybe a very fatty thigh.

Peppadews -- which are spicy, a little sweet, crisp when cold, and lightly pickled -- are an amazing complement to pulled pork, I found out.  Tomorrow, with the leftovers, I may eschew the sauce and just chop up some Peppadews."

One thing worth noting about this breakfast -- skirt steak hash with fried eggs -- is that fingerling potatoes simply do not make the ""crispy everything sticks together"" hash.  I got the ""loose and moist and tasty"" hash.  Which is fine, but when I make corned beef hash, for instance, it's the other I want."

"event","Some of my favorite burger things, with Memorial Day coming up:

1: If you aren't grilling, use cast-iron.  Not a covered pan, no finishing in the oven, none of that.  Hot cast-iron that's almost (or beyond almost) smoking when you put the patty on it, three to five minutes a side for medium-rare to medium, depending on how cold and thick the patty is.  Ideally, salt the burger on both sides, it helps to form the crust -- and the crust, the deep dark layer on both sides, is why you're using cast-iron instead of winding up with some grey patty.

If you have so many people over that you need to use the oven broiler to crowd 12 patties in at once, so that you're really just steaming them (which is what's going to happen if you don't have three inches between each patty), <I>send many of those people home.</I>  Or don't do burgers.  Or do them a couple at a time and make people wait.  Burgers are sandwiches made to order, and so they're actually kind of terrible for large groups unless you can stagger the eating enough that someone can just sit there making burgers, and people will materialize to eat them as you do.

2: Grind up bacon to mix in with the patty.  If you chop it up and freeze it first, it grinds just fine in your Cuisinart or stick blender.  The more well-done you cook your burger, the more noticeable the benefit here is: it ""bastes the burger from the inside"" (that's Dad Talk for you, but basting a burger is not actually something you want to do), which keeps it from drying out at the extremes.

3: Food does not magically stick together and become a patty just because you pushed it a little, or we'd all be doing that to oranges all the time just for fun.  If your beef is too lean, not only is it more likely to dry out, it's more likely to fall apart; sirloin is likely to fall apart because of the lack of connective tissue (which is what you <I>want</I> in burgers) compared to ground chuck, beef, or round.  Hamburger recipes that use any kind of binder or filler like breadcrumbs and eggs are

a) not hamburgers, dammit, they're just small meatloaves -- and those can be good, but they're no more the same thing than a ""hamburger steak"" is a steak

b) often the product of Depression-era meat-stretching techniques or granola-era meat-leannening frenzies.

Beef tastes good.  Good burgers take advantage of that instead of covering it up.

4: Okay, this is horrible.  This is terrible.  <I>Do not do this.</I>  But there's that place that's been on the Food Network and whatnot that does butter burgers.  No, not Culver's.  Yes, I know they call them that.  That is not these.  Culver's just butters their buns.  These use butter ... as a condiment.  Like a big pat, big <I>hunk</I> of butter, enough for six damn ears of corn, just sitting there on the burger.  It melts and pools up on the plate.  Add some hot sauce and it's this crazy Buffalo sauce thing.  I can't bring myself to use the quantities of butter I've seen used at that place, and even the (only comparatively) modest amounts of butter I've used make me go ""oh fuck, I better not do this again for a year.""  But you know what, it's probably not <I>much</I> worse than bacon, cheese, and mayo, none of which you will want on a burger that is as dripping with butter as freshly-dipped lobster.  And it's probably still lower in fat than a Big Mac or something.

5: Heinz 57.

I only tried it the year before last, having never really thought twice about it before.  I'm not sure I had even known that Heinz 57 is a non-ketchup Heinz product.  It's <I>great</I>.

6: Pimento cheese stuffed burgers.

Make two thin patties.  Put a cold lump of pimento cheese on one of them, and press the other down on top.  Err on the side of using too little cheese.

7: You actually can baste the burger after all:

Once in a while I want a really spicy hamburger, and there is a particular kind of spice I love -- the spice, sweetness, and saltiness of Louisiana hot sauce, which is like a slightly tamer Tabasco sauce with, to be honest, fuller flavor.

After you flip the burger -- while using cast-iron, because if you did this on the grill you would probably kill somebody -- shake a lot of Louisiana hot sauce on it as it cooks.  Like, a lot.  Bathe that motherfucker.  Cover it in sauce, to the point that the sauce that has dripped off the patty is reducing and will stick to the sides and sort of glaze everything."

This is for my benefit.  P.S. to me: bookmark the fruitcake tag.

Soaking in cupboard: home-candied blood orange sections and Barry Farms candied orange peel, in homemade triple sec with Regan's orange bitters.

(This will go into a chocolate-orange-cinnamon fruitcake, which is largely the same as my chocolate-cherry fruitcake but sub candied oranges for the dried cherries, add Ceylon cinnamon, clove, and bergamot oil, and use triple sec and lightly tea-infused whiskey as the alcohols.)

Hershey's new premium dark chocolates look like they'll save me a bundle on fruitcake this year, because -- from what I can tell trying one by itself, not yet baked into anything -- they seem better than Baker's, Lindt, or Ghirardelli, and are cheaper and more easily available than anything else."

"event","Ramps are wild leeks, native to North America, rarely if ever cultivated, and found most commonly along the Appalachians.  Supermarkets aren't likely to have them, but farmer's markets sometimes will.

They're pungent, maybe a little like the armpit of an onion when they're raw, closest to garlic than the rest of the allium family.  You use the bulb, the purple stem, and the green.

This year, I've done this with ramps:

Froze some.

Pickled the bulbs of others, like pickled garlic.

Chopped one up and covered it in olive oil (previously seasoned with marjoram, thyme, peppercorns, pepperoncini, and oven-dried tomatoes -- this was leftover oil after I used the last of the tomatoes, preserved in the oil last summer).  I'll use that seasoned oil on sandwiches, probably steak or cold roast beef.  Maybe pork roast and raab.

Fried potatoes with bacon and ramps, the classic ramp dish.

Eggs scrambled with ramps and bacon.

Puttanesca sauce: tomatoes, a little carrot (like as little as you would use of garlic in ordinary tomato sauce), diced kalamata olives and ramps, onion, anchovy, tuna roe, crushed red pepper.  Believe it or not, the olives overpowered the ramps here; I tend to favor a puttanesca that's heavy on the olives and allium, with everything else in the background."

"event","The smell of <I>fresh</I> rhubarb (both ""not cooked"" and ""recently picked,"" not this $12/pound stuff they had at the grocery two months ago) reminds me of growing up.  I had no idea rhubarb was something you could buy, at the time -- most of my friends didn't know what it was, even, except that it grew at our house on the other side of the raspberry patch.  I grew up eating it raw.

It wasn't until later that my mother made pie with it, though she may have made some for my grandparents and sent it home with them -- I knew they'd had it before.  I had asked her to make a grape pie, and she said I wouldn't like it; she was right; asked her to make a raspberry pie, she said I wouldn't like it; she was right; asked her to make a rhubarb pie, and when she relented, I loved it.

Anyway, I got a bunch of rhubarb from my mother's rhubarb patch -- a different one than the one just mentioned, different house.  I frozen a third of it -- which as you know if you've done it, is practically like cooking it, because when it thaws it'll be soft and will have released seemingly its own volume in liquid.  A third of it went into a strawberry-rhubarb pie.  The rest I'm fiddling with a bit, and I'll get plenty more in the next month:

Roasted rhubarb
Rhubarb with duck
Rhubarb gastrique
Rhubarb with custard
Rhubarb with fish -- it's sweet-sour the same way pomegranate is, so it's perfect for Platonic fish
Rhubarb khoresh (a meat stew with rhubarb)

I also have a bunch of raw rhubarb sitting in a jar of sugar.  As the sugar leeches the water out of the rhubarb and turns to syrup, I add a little more sugar.  I'm trying to get and use that <I>raw</I> flavor, the same way I've done with strawberries in the past.  I may make sorbet with the result, I may just combine with cold water for ""rhubarb-ade"" (maybe with some added lemon or lime juice)."

"event","More stuff you probably can't make because you don't have my idiosyncratic kitchen:

Okay, I've been hooked on this yuanyang stuff: a mixture of coffee, black tea, sugar, and milk.  You can have it hot or cold.  I've made it a ton of different ways, with good tea, not-so-great tea, drip coffee, Moka, milk, half and half, condensed milk, basically whatever I happen to have handy.  I like it to have just enough strong tea to be noticeably tannic, with just enough coffee and sweetness to tame the tannicity.  That's the balance I aim for.

So anyway.  I'm low on sugar.  I have a cup of sugar, and four lemons, which means I want to keep that sugar for lemonade, dig?  It's why I have the lemons.  I don't want a hot dog bun situation on my hands, where I use up the sugar and have these lemons unaded.

My kitchen has lots of almost-sugars in it.  The honeys and syrups don't count, because their numbers have dwindled: corbezzolo honey and New Zealand honeydew are not things you use in beverages, and they cost a fortune; birch syrup, smoked maple syrup, and bourbon-barrel-aged maple syrup are also prohibitively rare.

The syrup that resulted when I candied some vodka-soaked watermelon, I used that for a pitcher of cherry Kool Aid.

For the coffee, I almost used this strong strong vanilla bean syrup, and I might for another batch; but in looking around, I found an ingredient I don't use much: Filipino caramelized coconut milk.  It's gooey and brown and thick, and it's just dulce de leche made with coconut milk instead of dairy milk -- cooked down with sugar until it caramelizes.

""Never had coconut coffee,"" I thought to myself, ""but then again, I'm adding tea, too...""

So hot black tea, drip coffee, caramelized coconut milk, they all went in, and for good measure I added a few heaping teaspoons of a Filipino instant ginger drink.

It's really good.  You probably can't make it at home.  I probably won't be able to make it too many more times, since I don't have a Filipino market nearby anymore."

Melt <B>dark chocolate</b> in a double-boiler with just enough <B>milk</b> to thin it.  Pour over <B>vanilla ice cream</b> and top with <B>good peanuts</b> such as Trader Joe's blistered peanuts, which are far and away the best peanuts I've had for the money.  My easily-found alternative would be Planters Cocktail Peanuts -- you want the salt.

If you've never had <I>really good peanuts</I>, I recommend you find some.  Usually when we spend A Little Extra on food, it's to get something unavailable in cheaper forms -- ribeye steak, duck, Meyer lemons, saffron.  It's easy to forget that almost everything can be a little bit better when it's prepared with a little more care, whether we're talking about the strawberries from your farmer's market, the grits ground in the mill down the street, or a nice fresh bagel.

If you were to ask me the best way to spend your $20 snack budget, I'd tell you: P.B. Loco cinnamon-raisin peanut butter and bread to make sandwiches, really fresh juicy citrus fruit, and really good peanuts.  (And a bag of Kettle chips if you have money left over.)  Just off the top of my head, I can vouch for the Feridies and Virginia Diner brands, both of which may startle you with their prices (about twice that of Planters, in my experience) -- but if they don't grow peanuts where you live and all you know is Planters and Tom's, you will be amazed at how <I>crisp</I> peanuts can be."

Chicken wings rendang (chicken wings covered in curry-seasoned coconut milk and cooked until the fat breaks out of the milk).  My least favorite rendang, actually -- I was surprised, I envisioned something awesome, but the coconut milk had a greater tendency to ""curdle"" this time, and even once the fat had broken out, the wings never got uniformly crispy.

Lunch today, made last night:
Ragu on linguine.  You can and should make a ragu out of almost anything: in this case, I took the giblets from a duck (which, in classic factory-packed style, meant one kidney, one heart, one neck, and two livers), lightly floured them, and cooked them in a little bacon fat (and added the crumbled bacon) -- deglazed with pinot noir left over from a previous meal, added caramelized onions sitting in the fridge and a pimento (chopped up) left from when I made pimento cheese -- added half a can of tomato paste leftover from making posole -- duck broth from the duck carcass -- and cooked for six hours.

Rich, excellent, could've maybe used some garlic -- but with the exception of the linguine I'm having it over and the two slices of bacon, every ingredient was left from a previous meal."

Make your corned beef however you like; I roast mine after draining it in the fridge for a day and a half, because I grew up with overly stewed corned beef and had to move away from it to learn to like the cut again as anything but a deli meat.

Anyway, while it's cooking:

Simmer a bunch of potatoes until tender.  Put a few straight into the fridge in order to make hash tomorrow (they crisp up better than raw potatoes, which have a lot of moisture not yet cooked out; potatoes are wetter than they look).

While the potatoes are simmering, fry six pieces of bacon (this is a lot of colcannon, I'd say it's a piece of bacon per medium-to-small potato) until super-crispy; remove bacon and crumble.  In bacon fat, fry shredded kale, chopped scallions, and chopped young/spring onions with tops, for about ten to fifteen minutes.

Mash potatoes with butter and half-and-half or cream (or milk and more butter) and sufficient salt.  Add potatoes and bacon to pan with kale mixture, until you have a mixture heavily flecked with green -- don't dilute the kale too much, feel free to hold some mashed potatoes back.

Reduce heat to low and hold in non-stick or cast-iron pan until the corned beef is ready, stirring every half hour.  This will dry the colcannon some, making it a little richer."

Reviews usually go to <lj user=doctorpop>, but cocktail stuff usually goes here, so ... I dunno.  Most of y'all read both anyway, I think.

This is the new gin from Tanqueray, and it ought to be available nationwide now -- your liquor store may have it on sale, mine did.

According to Wikipedia, the rangpur is a hybrid between lemons and mandarins -- and contrary to the green-themed packaging and promotionals for the gin, I think it's actually orange.  That's all right, though, the gin has a highly highly limey note to it -- rather than being flavored after distillation, like the Seagram's flavored gins, this actually includes rangpurs, bay leaves, and ginger in with the traditional gin botanicals (juniper etc.), and has as much lime character to it as something like Bombay Sapphire or Citadelle has pineyness.  

It's a pretty remarkable gin.  Tanqueray makes good stuff to begin with -- Tanqueray Malacca was my favorite gin of all time, and both Tanq and Tanq 10 are in my top 5 or 6.  This is a smooth, smooth, gin, lower in alcohol than most.  Since discovering that I like gin and tonic (or gin and club soda) more than martinis, there have only been two gins that I'll drink straight: Malacca and now this.  I can't overstate how smooth it is -- if it were sweeter, it'd be like a liqueur.

Good straight.  Good with tonic.  And good in a Negroni.  There are cocktails where the lime note might be weird -- an Aviation, maybe a Salty Dog -- or where you'd want to adjust things (changing lemon juice to lime juice, though in the Aviation's case that might be ... odd) -- but boy, this is nice.  You're going to want a bottle of this when the weather gets warm."

"event","<B>Saffron-Vanilla Roast Chicken</b>

This is the best roast chicken I've made.  I'm warning you, though, that it isn't radically different from other roast chickens, and since the brine was more expensive than the chicken itself, I'm not positive it's worth making again.  I imagined something with a vividly yellow/orange skin, but that didn't happen either.

I brined a whole chicken for two days with a pinch of saffron and a fresh bay leaf; half of the salt in the brine was the vanilla bean salt I made last summer, a ground-up vanilla bean sealed up with kosher salt.

After 48 hours, I took it out, butterflied it (cutting along the breast and breaking the backbone), and let it dry at room temperature for the day, pouring off excess brine as it dripped out.  I find that chicken skin has trouble crisping if you don't do this, and as it is I still had a very moist bird, enough so that after resting, the skin was no longer crackling-crisp.

Roasted it at 450 for about 45-50 minutes.  With the help of the brine, and the cooking method, the breast was still moist and juicy -- enough so that I'm using the leftovers in salad -- and the thighs were fully cooked.

What you have is a bird sort of <I>perfumed</I> with saffron and especially vanilla.  There's a taste you can't quite place at first, which is the vanilla/chicken combination.  It's good, but again, this isn't a strange radical chicken dish that'll hit you over the head with innovation.  It's just fundamentally sound roast chicken."

1 pound <B>oxtails</b>, seared until browned.
1 duck's worth of <B>duck skin cracklings</b> and <b>chopped giblets</b> (heart, kidney, liver)
1 bottle <B>cheap beer</b>
1/4 - 1/2 cup <B>fond</b> from several roasted chickens and turkeys
1/2 cup <B>good barbecue sauce</b> (Rudy's)

Water to cover, 225 degrees all day, boom."

1 cup dried white hominy, soaked (or 1 can, I guess -- I've never used canned hominy)
1 can coconut milk
curry powder (I used Penzey's maharajah blend)
cayenne pepper, optional
1 teaspoon salt, roughly

Cover hominy in coconut milk in a pan and add water until completely covered.  Add enough curry powder for the liquid to turn yellow, and add the salt.  Don't taste for seasoning.

Cook covered for about three hours, until hominy is fully cooked through (it will still be firm).

Remove cover and cook over medium-high heat until coconut milk has cooked off, releasing some of its fat; fry until the coconut milk has reduced enough to coat each kernel of hominy and has turned golden.

It'll be more intensely flavored the next day, after the hominy has had a chance to soak up the seasoning."

<B>Super Bowl Chili</b>

1 1/2 pounds ground beef (80 - 85% lean), browned and drained of fat
1 pound beef shank, browned
4 slices bacon, crumbled (and drained of most of their fat)
1 can cannelini beans
1 can pinto beans
onion, Cubanelle pepper, ""long green chile""
cumin, thyme, pepper, Tabasco sauce, cilantro, garlic
demiglace, water

275-300 degrees for four hours, shank meat shredded and bone removed, 350 degrees for two hours, and then sat overnight

Tasted, reseasoned (salt, cilantro, Tabasco).  Topped with one 99-cent bag of Fritos, crushed, and more Tabasco sauce.  Baked at 375 for one hour.  Served with cheap shredded cheddar cheese.

By the next day, it's like this ... block ... of meat and bean, thanks to the gelatin of the demiglace.

<B>Gumbo z'herbes</b>

I've been craving gumbo and craving greens, and ingredients for the former have been accumulating in the freezer, so even though gumbo z'herbes (a greens gumbo which is not actually quite meatless) is a Lenten dish, I decided to make it for Carnival.

Right now stock is simmering with a hambone I had set aside for just such an occasion, a goose neck, a duck neck, and chicken wing tips.  I'll make a little shellfish stock from shrimp and lobster shells too.

For greens I have collards, kale, beet greens, carrot tops, dandelion greens, and celery leaves.

For meat, smoked chaurice, tasso, and lobster tail.

Veggies: okra, onion, garlic, Cubanelle pepper, maybe chile, maroon carrot."

<B>Roasted lemonade</b>: take about 6 lemons, halve them, put them in a pie plate or some such, sprinkle with a couple handfuls of sugar and near-cover with water; roast at 375 for an hour-ish; puree pulp, two of the lemon halves, and more sugar to taste, strain, and add the juice of 2 fresh lemons.

I don't know.  Whiskey sour and Bellini, but with a bitterness, too, an edge -- roasted lemonade, as I've posted previously, has a bitterness to it similar to white grapefruit juice.  

I'm sure rum, tequila, or brandy would work too, but I don't particularly want to mix that many spirits up in my head tonight."

"event","<B>What I'm making lately</b>

Yesterday I broke down both a goose and a duck:

Skin and excess fat (primarily from the goose) went into a big cast-iron pot, covered with water, simmered for a few hours until the fat was all rendered out.  I put the cracklin in a bag in the fridge after eating a few ow-ow-hot bites with Tabasco sauce.

Legs of both birds were covered in rendered fat and cooked all day in the oven at low heat, and have been bagged in the fat.  Some of that will go into a cassoulet with knockwurst, sauerkraut, and white beans.  Some of it I'll have with pepper jelly, greens, and grits.

I skinned the goose breasts because the subcutaneous fat is SO thick, but left the skin on the duck breasts; those will be frozen for later meals, unless I decide to make a sandwich of one of the duck breasts.

The giblets and necks are in the fridge, haven't decided what to do with them -- probably I'll save the necks and make a gumbo or greens with all three frozen necks (there's a turkey neck in there) when the weather gets very cold.

The rest of the birds have been roasted until very brown and went into a total of three stockpots to make a ton of stock.

Non-bird cooking: the store had Melissa's (Melinda's? I always forget) Meyer lemons, which cost an arm and a leg but which I mean to get my money's worth out of: I have three of them simmering with vanilla bean right now for marmalade; one is being candied (I might make it two); one went into drinks; and that leaves me with four I haven't spoken for yet.  Infused vodka and/or limoncello is possible."

"event","What I made today:

Lunch: Chicken wings marinated in Goya mojo criollo, lemon juice, and Tabasco chipotle.

Dinner:

Peanut stew:

Turkey breast (left from the turkey the other day, with the confit and all)
Peeled chopped yams
Smoked chaurice sausage
Chopped piri piri chiles
Minced fresh ginger
Chopped beet greens
Smuckers Natural chunky peanut butter (this is good for cooking with but seems like it would be weird to use on a sandwich: I love the SN creamy, but the chunky is new, and the oil is even more prone to separating -- but it separates above a thick layer of chopped peanuts, making it even harder to stir it back in; very weird)
Allspice, black pepper, salt, ground Tabasco chile

Normally you'd have tomato, onion, and garlic in this, and maybe carrot too -- I'm all out.  And with the sausage, I didn't want to consider okra or bay leaves, or it might seem too much like peanut butter gumbo.

Anyway, it's so good.  Warm and spicy and hearty without being too starchy (even though I served it over rice), very like gumbo in <I>that</I> respect."

"event","Y'all done with those turkey leftovers?

All right, lately:

Jambalaya, with the leftover ham from Thanksgiving and some smoked chaurice sausage.

Fried smelt.  Smelt is a cheap fish that looks like a large sardine.  Historically it's been a staple food in a lot of northern cultures, so they sell it here once in a while and I picked it up while it was available.  It smells very fishy as it cooks, but is actually about as mild as haddock or cod once cooked -- so bland as to be boring.  I used a lot of hot sauce and lemon to eat them.

Crabcakes with the bechamel as a binder.  Okay, but again bland (this was a day of bland seafood).  With good fresh crab that might have been okay.

Boiled shrimp: 1 bottle beer, 1 bottle Malta Goya soda, cayenne pepper.  Tasty both hot and cold.

A variety of very basic grilled cheese sandwiches: fresh mozzarella, basil, prosciutto, and seasoned oil on a kaiser roll, pressed; cream cheese and 2 year cheddar on pumpernickel; fresh mozzarella and salami; etc.  Dinner is either one of these or I'll go out for a steak bomb, haven't decided yet.


Also: it is <B>Repeal Day</b>, the anniversary of the end of Prohibition.  Celebrate appropriately.  I had a Sazerac this afternoon and I'm figuring on a Tom Collins tonight.


I just got a digital camera on the cheap from ebay, so expect food photos in the future."

Dr Pepper (particularly if you're at one of the many soda fountains where the Dr Pepper is good but the Coca-Cola is weak)
Lager

Of all of these, iced coffee and Starbuck's liqueur are the only ones I hadn't heard of before trying them myself.  So don't give me that look about the lemonade; in parts of Europe, the local soda companies sell pre-mixed 50:50 citrus-colas."

Hot dogs for lunch.  Yeah, you'll notice I eat a lot of hot dogs and hamburgers.  It's just a thing.  I rediscovered the greatness of a great hot dog a couple years ago thanks to Boar's Head natural-casing franks, and the novelty and joy haven't worn off yet.

Dinner: The local store last night, where I had to go for rye flour, had these <I>enormous</I> pork chops.  I mean a pound each and what must be two inches thick.  What the hell would I do with those, I thought; let's find out, I decided.  So I bought a package of two and popped them into a brine today of apple cider slightly diluted, salt, burnt sugar syrup, and bay leaves.  Tonight I butterflied a chop, seared it, and put some of that rabbit stuffing in before roasting it.  I'm typing this before it's done, so I won't post the entry until I've eaten and I see how it came out.

Stuff I made today:

Rye gingerbread, aforementioned.

Three fruitcakes using my <a href=""http://redfusion.livejournal.com/35605.html"">base fruitcake recipe</a> (well, you can derive one from it) cut into a 2/3 size to accomodate the amount of butter I had in the house:

""Some kinda Italian thing"": pine nuts, hazelnuts, citron and orange rind, cherry-infused bourbon, crushed Amaretti cookies.

Mexican Hot Chocolate: cocoa, 4 oz chopped chocolate, pecans, orange rind, ginger, allspice, Penzey's baking spice, ground chipotle, candied habanero syrup, rum.  Can I just say I love that habanero syrup?  Deciding to candy those habaneros to exploit the amazing flavor of them was a terrific idea: the heat here is so much more specific and complicated than generic chile pepper.  This is a fruitcake with a building heat, no stronger than ginger or cinnamon at first bite, but it creeps up on you.

Cherry-Chocolate: cocoa, 12 oz chopped chocolate, pecans, orange and citron rind, dried tart cherries, cherry-infused bourbon.  This one is <I>chockfull</I>.  I'm waiting for it to cool down to see if there's even enough cake to hold the fruit and chocolate together.

Okay, so how was dinner:

It was good!  I could have roasted it a few minutes less, but it's pork, everyone errs on the side of caution with pork, even me."

"event","Crap crap crap.  I forgot to write down what I was doing while I was making the gingerbread, and have made two fruitcakes since this morning.  This is my best guess at reconstructing it:

I riffed on <a href=""http://frenchfood.about.com/od/breadspatries/r/painep2.htm"">this pain d'epices</a> recipe, and:

Subbed sorghum for the honey and some of the sugar syrup.
Subbed half a can of Coca-Cola cooked down to syrup for some more of the sugar syrup.
Used 2/3 cup rye flour.

Used this spice blend instead of what they list:
1 teaspoon ground ginger (maybe a bit more, I did it to taste)
1 teaspoon ground aniseed
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon French four spice (which includes, importantly, white pepper -- it is noticeable, nicely so, in the final product)

Added a shot of bourbon (rye type; rye whiskey would be an even better choice, but Eagle Rare was on sale).

Added 1/3 cup candied diced orange peel.

I think, I think, that covers it.  

The final product is dense, but dense and dry-ish like rye bread, not dense and moist like a brownie.  It's still bread-type gingerbread, not house-type, but it's almost ... biscotti-like, you know?  Not to that extent, but in that direct.

Pronounced ginger heat, with the bitterness of the orange peel working spectacularly with it.  The anise and white pepper are the flavor notes after that, and then everything else -- bourbon/rye/otherspice/sorghum -- is a background.  Molasses, especially blackstrap, would push that dark sweetener note further forward I think -- but I like it like this.  Of course, it's the last of my sorghum, and good luck finding that in New Hampshire.  But that's all right, I made enough to freeze, I think, especially since it's surely too strong to be a hit at Thanksgiving."

Gee, can you tell what I used for molds for these four mini chocolate ""bars""?

Dark chocolate, four flavors:

<B>Candied kalamata olive</b>.  Actually <I>very good</I>.  It tastes like chocolate and olive ... and yet it's very good.  No, seriously, this one surprised me.  Mind you they're <I>candied</I> olives -- I had previously soaked kalamata olives in ice water overnight to draw some of the brine out, and then candied them over a two-week period, dried them, and have now diced some of them for the chocolate.

<B>Sesame seeds and coarse salt</b>.  You barely taste the sesame -- I used one of those sesame salt shakers, you know? -- but the salt with the dark chocolate?  Very nice.

<B>Aniseed</b>.  This was a no-brainer.  Awesome, except for the seeds being a little harder than I'd like.  But so good.  Maybe I'll grind them next time.

<B>Green peppercorn</b>.  So much better than Dolfin's pink peppercorn bar.  Seriously.  This works nicely.  A little too crunch -- again, maybe I'll grind them -- but the taste is less overwhelmingly peppery like Dolfin's offering is."

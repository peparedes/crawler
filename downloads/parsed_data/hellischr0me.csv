"event","SOO...I was going to buy a house in Mississippi (right over the border a few miles from Memphis). I even went and got approved on a loan. Then,&nbsp;it dawned on me.....HOUSES ARE EXPENSIVE!&nbsp;Mortgage...property taxes....income tax in Mississippi....home maintenance.....mowing the yard.....homeowners insurance......etc etc. I decided&nbsp;ex-nay on that&nbsp;idea-ay! Maybe one day....but not now and not in Memphis! My&nbsp;goal is to be out here another 2 years TOPS. Then I'm going to be HOOOOOME-WARD-BOUND&nbsp;just like John Denver.

OH and I had to tell a creepy old man (45-50ish&nbsp;I'm guessing?)&nbsp;to stop calling me at my desk (he works for the same company). We&nbsp;talked briefly&nbsp;at orientation. For some reason he thinks it's appropriate to call a 24 year old girl he doesn't know at her desk and ask to come by her house? Actually, I documented telling him to get lost in an email...over the company's server. High Five Heather!

I'm coming home on Memorial Day weekend! I hope some people are going to be home!"

"event","&nbsp;So I'm sick today. I've slept 16 hours of the last 24. My head throbs.....my muscles hurt...even my gums hurt. Eww.

On a more positive note!...My last day at my hellish CPA firm will be next Wednesday. I'm so super excited. My new job will start on December 31st in Memphis. I'm scared/excited/hopeful etc. I'm pretty sure this is a good thing. It feels right anyways. I can't help but feel a little guilt over ""throwing away"" a job at a place that 300,000 people apply at each year. But, a ""great opportunity"" doesn't necessarily mean you'll be happy doing it. The work actually wasn't that bad....the bad part was working with assholes. The ones that like to smile at you then talk about you as soon as you walk away.&nbsp; I can't imagine what has been said since I put in my notice....oh well....life goes on.&nbsp;

I need to see some people this weekend! And I will make that happen...Jennifer and Shanna come to mind."

"event","So Im pretty sure I remember someone posting about how ridiculous it is that there is this ""protest"" going on right now...but I'm going to add my thoughts on the subject anyway. Some people think that by not pumping gas on a designated day (ie. May 15th..today) that they will somehow hurt oil companies...and send some sort of message. Well..ummm...this just won't work. I know all the ""protesters"" hearts are in the right place, but this is not the way to get their message across. The fact is..oil companies are big...they aren't going to be hurting if you decide not to buy from them for one day. 

BECAUSE, big oil understands one of the simplest economic concepts...inelastic demand. People buy gas b/c they have to...they pay 3 bucks a gallon b/c there is really no other alternative at the moment. Big oil doesn't care if you pump gas today b/c they know that you either pumped extra yesterday in preparation for today...or you'll pump gas tomorrow b/c you didnt do it today. It all balances out....they get the same amount of money...you get the same amount of gas. IF people are tired of gas prices and want to hurt oil companies..they should develop fuel alternatives...or buy electric cars....or a bike. SO, I pumped gas today...why? b/c I was out and I need to go places. 

I did hear something pretty cool today though...it seems that the Japanese are researching the viability of using Sake to fuel their cars...can you imagine if Sake poured out of the Service station pumps instead of gas??! This seems like an alcoholics and an environmentalists dream all at the same time yay!"

"event","So, the past few months have been incredibly hard. EVERYTHING I have known and clung to has changed. Considering I don't handle change well, it's turned me completely upside down. I'm dealing...not happy about it by any means..but I'm hoping everything will turn out better this way in the end. I ended a relationship with a person who didn't treat me well, but made me feel like I had somehow provoked the treatment. I'm starting to realize that even though I'm sure I made mistakes, I didn't ""deserve"" to be treated that way. It's better to be alone than with someone who doesn't treat you well...granted it's a huge adjustment. I'm sure it would've been way easier to just stay in it b/c it was safe and it was what I knew. I took a chance though. And it was really hard and still is. 

Six years is no small amount of time. Some marriages don't last that long. I grieve for how it was in the beginning... everyday. My heart hurts.  But I started to realize that I was growing up. It's time. It's time to start doing instead of just preparing to do. It's time for a little follow through. I couldn't wait to start my life anymore...waiting on someone else to decide to start theirs. I've realized that I have neglected myself in an attempt to put my full attention on someone else. Note to everyone: don't do this it's called codependence. 

Anyway...I'm ready to be over this...too bad you can't rush that stuff. I will find out what makes me happy, independent of someone else. Seems simple enough..but it's harder than you'd think after being ""half of a whole"" for so long. I lost myself..but I'm finding it again. 

So here are some things that I'm sure make me happy (I will add more as necessary):

1. The colors blue and green.
2. Art
3. Music
4. Dry humor
5. Animals...dogs preferably
6. Walking in dewey grass barefooted in the summer.
7. Fireflies
8. That time in late May and early September, right at dusk, when it just gets cool enough to
   put on a sweater...but can still wear sandals. 
9. Thinking about being a kid...playing in the sandbox and on the swing-set.
10.Big piles of dried leaves 
11.Digging in the cool moist dirt to plant things.
12.The ocean.
13.The way that driving the stretch of highway between Atlanta and Chattanooga feels so familiar  
   like home.
14.Mom hugs.
15.Yoplait Strawberry Custard-Style Yogurt
16.Shy people that open up one on one.
17.Cuddling"

My mom bought a ridiculous amount of security equipment for my apartment...making me feel almost safe again. These include a blinding floodlight, mace, two door-jam bars (similar to putting a chair under the knob), AND a motion sensor that turns on my bedroom light and chimes when creepy people enter the bushes.   ......that last sentence is far to long by any standard...I won't tell if you won't.

I lost my bottom retainer. CURSES. This makes the 3rd time in 6 years. I swear they're shifting already. Tomorrow I go get putty shoved down my throat while they take ""impressions"" of my teeth. (Shouldn't they save these impressions for habitual retainer losers like me?)

I have learned that China is becoming ultra-picky when it comes to who they'll allow to adopt Chinese orphans. Apparently, you are no longer allowed to adopt if you take antidepressants, are single, have net assets less than $80k, or are obese (a Body Mass index of 40 or more). While this is sort of comical....it's utterly ridiculous at the same time."

Pros of burning bridges:

1. Ill live on Oak Street close to school.
2. My roommate's friends won't be lame-os.
3. I'll live in an awesome historic building.
4. I won't have to be present at 18 year old drinking parties....(potential said roommate has an  alcoholic little sister)
5. The new roommate is already a member of my circle of friends.
6. The old potential roommates family is scary especially her dad...and I have been given the impression that they'll be over all the time. Cartman did say ""Poor people tend to gather in clusters""...ha jk.

Cons:

1. The old potential roommate will hate me and probably never talk to me again.
2. She just got out of the hospital with an ovarian cyst ""attack""
3. She said to me ""Thanks for moving in with me Heather. Now I can pay my mortgage AND eat.""

Things to do: 


This week
Tomorrow: Get an oil change as soon as place opens, then take car to be worked on b/c of a CRAZY jerking transmission (worried this could be bad)

Thursday: Take new puppy dog (6 week old Boston Terrier!) that still doesn't have a name to the vet. Take Buster to the other vet  for his shots and teeth cleaning.

Friday: Get a haircut for graduation and buy something to wear TO graduation. Study for GMAT

Saturday: Study for GMAT test

Sunday: Graduate at the Mckenzie Arena at 2, family time, more studying

Next week:

Study all week until Thursday when I drive up to Knoxville to take the 4 hour test.

Friday: Register for classes and get conditionally admitted through the graduate office w/unofficial GMAT scores from the test I took the day before

August 21st: Start Grad School!

"event","Joel (Michael's littlest brother) came over last night with nasty hickeys all over his neck. This is disturbing for so many different reasons. One of the reasons being the fact that his girlfriend can't even drive yet. TEAR-""They grow up so fast these days."" I'm 22 years old and can honestly say that I've NEVER had to wear a turtleneck to cover up ""certain markings."" He tried to elaborate about what happened after the hickeys, but I didn't let that happen...bluck. While he was here, he informed me that I am a hard person to get to know. Yes I knew that, it's because I'm shy..always have been. I'm thinking that the fact that I'm ""hard to get to know"" must make certain people think that I don't have feelings. Hmmm...well I do."

"event","We just had our first run-in with THE DEPARTMENT OF ""HOMELAND SECURITY."" Michael and I got some brochures from the French tourist office today in the mail today. The envelope had been SLICED open with a letter opener on both ends (as to easily slide the contents in and out). It was then placed in a clear plastic bag that said ""Your mail was damaged in shipment."" 

All I can say is that I hope they have gathered some information from my mail that helps THE WAR ON TERROR. I most definitely DON'T MIND AT ALL that my personal freedoms are being taken away- I mean, it's not like I used those stupid things anyway."

"event","I watched this show on Thursday night about a family of WEIRDOs who had 14 kids. The show was on TLC and called ""14 children and Pregnant Again""...GROSS! The Duggars live in Arkansas and are happy with ""whatever the lord gives them."" I think the lord should give them some contraceptives. Anyway, the strange part about this whole thing is, the family has named EVERY child a name that starts with a ""J"". One name that stands out was ""Jeddah""...uhhh. AND, the family home-schools all the children at the kitchen table and hold church services in their house. Does anyone see a parallel with a certain unnamed local family?? I can't help but feel bad for these kids, because they aren't learning the things that they need in order to function with ""normal people."" In one clip, ""Momma Duggar"" was teaching the five year olds a workbook lesson on ""BANKRUPTCY."" I think I was learning to tie my shoes at five...but whatever. I told my dad that seeing that much wholesomeness sickens me. He said that I'm probably just warped. There was something about seeing all the kids get excited (wet themselves excited) about going to to the grocery store in their bus that made me sick/sad. Everyone should check this show out, because I'm sure TLC will play it again. OH AND UPDATE! SINCE THE SHOW..TWO MORE KIDS HAVE BEEN BORN! I'll bet you can't guess what their first name starts with!"

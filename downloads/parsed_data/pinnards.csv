They saw me in the distance and stopped their grass sniffing to wag their butts and wave their tails like they'd been expecting me the whole time! I went over and patted them as they jumped around and the puppy wound his leash around my leg. I don't know who was more excited, me or them! hee hee. Silly doggies."

"event","A couple of months ago, I was in New York for the weekend and hung out with Anthony and his friends, a brazilian couple. Aside from learning you can get decent massages in seemingly dodgy joints in Chinatown, I also found out it's a lot more troublesome to get a hold of a fake Louis Vuitton than the real thing. 

I met up with the group after they had gone shopping on 5th Avenue and were ready to hit Chinatown. They were on a whirlwind tour of all the New York neighbourhoods. As soon as we get out of the subway, Renato pulls out his iphone to find an address--a friend had given them recommendations on where to go for the good fake stuff. We head over there, ironically carrying the real goods from 5th Ave.

The girl (I forget her name so let's just call her Jane) is looking for Louis Vuitton and apparently they don't just put that outside on display, you need to specifically ask the store clerks for them. We find the little alley of stores their friend told them about and enter. On both sides, shops are filled with bags and ""Hello miss, you wanna buy bag? Miss?"" echoes everywhere.

Jane beckons me to a shop and asks the store keeper to show me an LV wallet. She walks away because they only allow one customer at a time to check out the stuff. The guy pulls out some boxes from a black plastic bag and very briefly flashes some wallets at me. I'm not interested and move on.

We soon come out into a back alley where Jane is talking to a little Asian guy who's showing her what looks like a menu of bags. She studies it for awhile and then points to something. Then he says,""Ok, come with me,"" and we follow. 

The guy's son insists on coming along too so his wife joins in the trek to take care of him. About a block in, someone asks how far we have to walk to which the guy says, ""You want LV you have to walk."" We all just look at each other, shrug and continue on. It's kind of exciting.

Then the guy stops suddenly and says to me and Anthony, ""You two stay here, two at a time,"" and tells the brazillian couple to go with him. They climb into an SUV with tinted windows or something so we can't see inside it. 
 
Me and Anthony sit by the curb with the little Asian guy's wife and kid. Anthony asks if there's a trap door on the bottom of the car and stairs that lead to a big room with lots of bags. The wife laughs and says, ""If only!""

She says it's not like it was before where you could just display LV bags in your store, you've got to be very careful. I ask why just LV? She says it's cos' they have agents who go around checking if you sell their fake stuff and they sue you for it. Apparently the other companies aren't so strict with it and all they do is come round and confiscate the stuff you have. She also says the reason people are so enthusiastic about fake LVs is the company hardly has sales whereas other popular brands like Coach offer good discounts pretty often. 
 
As we're talking, the kid runs off and knocks on the car window. The mom quickly shouts for him to come back and he does. Then her walkie talkie goes off and it's her husband asking what's going on. She tells him it was just their son. They hang up and she tells her son not to do that anymore, ""It gave daddy a scare.""
 
After awhile the brazilian couple come out of the car carrying something in a black plastic bag and the Asian guy follows. 

At this point I tell the Asian couple I'm a reporter and ask if I can do a story on them. They're concerned at first about the use of their real names but I'm able to allay their fears. We exchange contact information and when we're about to leave, the guy says that what they're doing is helping people-- getting them branded stuff that's cheap.  

I'm amused. I ask Renato how much the bag cost and he says they'd bargained for it down from $160 to $100. He seemed pretty pleased."

"event","So I guess when people really need to talk to someone, they will talk to anybody. I was heading home from Atlanta where I'd been covering a conference and went up to a bar at the airport to check out the menu. 

This nice lady next to me moved her stuff off a chair so I could sit. I ordered a bunch of wings and a good glass of extra spicy bloody mary (cos' the lady had one and it looked very yummy-the power of suggestion right?)and waited. Then the lady spoke to me. It started out like a usual conversation at an airport--do you live here? where are you going to? what were you doing here? She thought I was 20! *scream* I learned she was from Equador and she was visiting her family and now she was going home. And our conversation the whole time was intermittent. She'd ask something, and I'd answer, I'd ask something and she'd answer and then I'd go back to sipping my drink and eating my wings. 

Then at one point she sighed and said, ""I'm sad"" -- kind of a weird thing for a stranger to say. Superficial conversations almost never get emotional. So I had to ask why and then the floodgates to her life story were opened. I swear I didn't ask that many questions but I soon learned that her parents and her older sister had moved to the States when she was just 15. Her sister had married an American and I guess brought her parents over. She remained behind because she had no visa to move permanently and so she was taken care of by her uncle while her family made arrangements to get her a greencard. 

I think by this time I know her name is Cara...or was it Clara? Anyway, she enjoyed living in Ecuador, being a teenager and not have her parents around to boss her about. And every year or so she'd make a trip to the States to see her parents. This particular trip was 6 months long. She's 30 and she's already got her greencard and the luxury (in my jealous eyes) of moving to the States permanently or staying in Ecuador. This was the trip where she'd make her decision. And, being at the airport heading to Ecuador, it was clear she'd made it. She had a cat, an apartment,good friends, a good job as a reporter and a boyfriend (of 6 months--they met 2 weeks before her trip)who wanted her to move in with him and marry him. 

If she moved to the states, she'd have to get a blue collar job, it wouldn't be a good life, she said. And yet, if she moved to the States, she'd be able to enjoy her mom's cooking and the warmth of her family that she had only now, way past her teenage years, begun to appreciate. She teared as she thought of this and had to dab her eyes dry. 

""But you can come and visit often,"" I offered. 

Yea, but it's very expensive, she said. Apparently over a thousand USD, about as much as it would cost me to go home during the off-peak season. 

But there was nothing to resolve. She had made her decision and felt it was a good and wise one and she was looking forward to her life with her boyfriend who she'd been talking to for 2 hours every day while she was away. She would just have to get over missing her family.

She asked me for the time and then got her stuff together. She said she needed a smoke before the flight. We hugged goodbye and that was it. 

It's weird because I constantly think about the things she has had to over the last few months. How much longer should I stay away from home? But that's a story for another day. I'm just amazed at how much of her personal life this girl from Ecuador let me in on and I didn't even get her last name."

"event","so please bear with me if i make no sense or bore you to death. feel free to skip over (not that you needed permission) but if you appreciate any bit of this, please let me know, i feel like there are cobwebs over my hands and keyboard for not producing anything other than at work.

And speaking of hands, I was watching Malcolm Gladwell give a lecture on what we can learn from spaghetti sauce (it's <a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce.html"">here</a> if you're interested) and noticed his hands are kind of like a cross between <lj user=dieseldawn>'s hands and my friend Anthony's hands-- long, straight, medium-width, rectangular fingers that are sort of bendy yet pointy at the same time. Have you noticed how  someone's hands are a more significant part of someone's personality than their smile? I think so anyway. 

Before you get all predictable on me and accuse me of having a hand fetish, I want to say there is nothing sexual about my appreciation of hands. Just look how much character they have! The way they rest in default position, the way they grab, point, gesticulate, even curse. Ching's hands,as I mentioned, are long, straight, medium-width and they're bendy at the tips but they're also very wiggly the way she wields them. The initial motion to grab things tends to look like an octopus reaching for something with its tentacles(not an insult ching! it's character!). She doesn't often fold them at their mid-joints. My friend Anthony doesn't either but his hands, though similar in shape are stiffer, not wiggly. <lj user=superen>'s hands are small but stronger and sturdier looking. When she holds a cup full of water, it doesn't look like it will ever spill. My hands are sort of skinny, pale and of a very average length. I think they're boring and they don't hold things or grab things in a cool way like other people's hands do. they're just sort of functional. oh dear, what does that say about me?

And moving on to a similar topic, are we really left-handed or right-handed? Are some things just a right hand's job or a left hand's job? I've been having a cold lately and I realised that when I blow my nose, I use my left hand. And because my thumb for some reason hurts a little, I tried to use my right hand but it just didn't feel...well, right.

And that's all I have to say about hands."

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - Not even Santa Claus is safe as the violent Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro celebrates the Christmas season.

Drug traffickers in a Rio slum opened fire on a helicopter carrying a Santa to a children's party, apparently mistaking it for a police helicopter, police said on Tuesday.

""They thought it was a police operation and started shooting. Luckily, nobody was hurt,"" a police official said.

The helicopter had to return to its base after the attack.

Two bullet holes were found in its fuselage.

Police said the pilot, contracted to take an actor dressed as Santa to the party in the Nova Mare slum, was flying over the neighboring Vila Joao shantytown when it was fired upon on Sunday.

Santa later returned to Nova Mare by car to distribute Christmas presents.

Most of Rio's 700-plus slums are controlled by drug traffickers and are not regularly patrolled by police, who instead go into the slums in military-style raids, often using helicopters and armored vehicles."

"event","For about a year or so now I've had a pretty decent, stable job. But I've been living like a college kid (well, probably worse than today's college kid). My tiny studio apartment consists of a coffee table, an inflatable queen-size bed, a 15ish-inch tv and a floor lamp.

It's not that I can't bear to part with my money, it's just, I want to keep the things I own to a minimum so I won't have trouble moving again when the right opportunity calls. I even keep empty boxes in my store room in  preparation for the day. 

Meanwhile, my hair has been falling at the normal rate of 100 a day (give or take 50, seeing as I have a high sushi and therefore soya sauce intake). My carpet has taken it upon itself to hold on to all of it and I think by today it has held enough hair to make a wig. 

I bought a tiny Black and Decker vacuum cleaner many months ago but gave up trying to suck all the hairs out of the clutches of my crazy carpet. My efforts were futile. 

I finally gave in a week ago and bought a proper household-sized vacuum cleaner online. It arrived at my door step today and I spent an hour on hair suckage as soon as I got home from work. From corner to corner, up and down, left to right, I made sure every single tiny hair got sucked up. I didn't even spare the spider in the corner (oh d-d-d-dear Ch-Charlotte!)

I can't begin to explain how awesome it feels to finally have a clean floor. Now all I need is a full-length mirror and I'm all set!"

"event","WARNING!! THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE NEW TRANSFORMERS, READ NO FURTHER.

So I took half the day off to catch the new transformers movie. Totally worth it. I have my gripes but first the  good parts. Man, when I first saw Optimus Prime I almost cried. Yes, I was one of the dorks in the audience who actually clapped when he appeared on screen. Oh man. There he stood, with the same voice, tall, powerful and not dead like when we last saw him. AWESOME! I was impressed with the special effects and beaming at the sound of transformation. Cool that they chose the Hoover dam as a location (aside from the fact they wrote it into the plot) cos' I've always thought it looked like there was...yes, it's coming...wait for it...more than meets the eye. 

That said, the line was too cheesy for a real life movie (as opposed to a cartoon) and it was used 5 times too many. MEGATRON IS NOT A PLANE!! Starscream is not all grey and he has a high pitched voice! Soundwave is much bigger than that and makes a low sound. I don't remember Ironhide being British either. There were wayyyy too few transformers! I didn't quite remember who Bonecrusher was so I looked him up and found out he's a constructicon, a part of Devastator. but wasn't Devastator a separate robot in the movie? Arg! Anyway,it was definitely not a big enough reunion. It does seem like they set it up for a sequel though so we'll see how that goes. 

Am still very excited from the movie and would watch it again. Also want to watch the old one again. They made humans look worth saving. And if I took anything away from it it's that when the D.O.D fails, the autobots will save us!

Now let's discuss!!"

"event","Chief: Gunman kills at least 21 at Virginia Tech

(CNN) -- A lone gunman is dead after police said he killed at least 21 people Monday during twin shootings on the Virginia Tech campus -- the deadliest school attacks in U.S. history.

""Some victims were shot in a classroom,"" university police Chief Wendell Flinchum said during a news conference in Blacksburg. 

Police believe there was only one gunman, Flinchum said. 

Spokespersons for hospitals in Roanoke, Christiansburg, Blacksburg and Salem told CNN that they were treating 29 people from the shootings. 

Sharon Honaker with Carilion New River Medical Center in Christiansburg said one of the four gunshot victims being treated there was in critical condition. 

""Today the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions,"" said university President Charles Steger. ""The university is shocked and indeed horrified."" 

The killings mark the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, surpassing attacks at Columbine High School in 1999 and at the University of Texas in 1966. 

One person was killed and others were wounded at multiple locations inside a dormitory about 7:15 a.m., Flinchum said. Two hours later, another shooting at Norris Hall, the engineering science and mechanics building, resulted in multiple casualties, the university reported. 

The first reported shooting occurred at West Ambler Johnston Hall, a four-story coed dormitory that houses 895 students. The dormitory, one of the largest residence halls on the 2,600-acre campus, is located near the drill field and stadium.

Amie Steele, editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper, said one of her reporters at the dormitory reported ""mass chaos.""

The reporter said there were ""lots of students running around, going crazy, and the police officers were trying to settle everyone down and keep everything under control,"" according to Steele. 

Kristyn Heiser said she was in class about 9:30 a.m. when she and her classmates saw about six gun-wielding police officers run by a window.

""We were like, 'What's going on?' Because this definitely is a quaint town where stuff doesn't really happen. It's pretty boring here,"" said Heiser during a phone interview as she sat on her classroom floor.

Student reports 'mayhem'
Student Matt Waldron said he did not hear the gunshots because he was listening to music, but he heard police sirens and saw officers hiding behind trees with their guns drawn. 

""They told us to get out of there so we ran across the drill field as quick as we could,"" he said. 

Waldron described the scene on campus as ""mayhem."" 

""It was kind of scary,"" he said. ""These two kids I guess had panicked and jumped out of the top-story window and the one kid broke his ankle and the other girl was not in good shape just lying on the ground."" 

Madison Van Duyne said she and her classmates in a media writing class were on ""lockdown"" in their classrooms. They were huddled in the middle of the classroom, writing stories about the shootings and posting them online. 

The university is updating its more than 26,000 students through e-mails, and an Internet webcam is broadcasting live pictures of the campus. 

The shootings came three days after a bomb threat Friday forced the cancellation of classes in three buildings, WDBJ in Roanoke reported. Also, the 100,000-square-foot Torgersen Hall was evacuated April 2 after police received a written bomb threat, The Roanoke Times reported. 

Last August, the first day of classes was cut short by a manhunt after an escaped prisoner was accused of killing a security guard at a Blacksburg hospital and a sheriff's deputy. 

After the Monday shootings, students were instructed to stay indoors and away from windows, police at the university said. 

""Virginia Tech has canceled all classes. Those on campus are asked to remain where they are, lock their doors and stay away from windows. Persons off campus are asked not to come to campus,"" a statement on the university Web site said. 

Before Monday, the deadliest school shootings came in 1966 and 1999. 

In the former, Charles Joseph Whitman, a 25-year-old ex-Marine, killed 13 people on the University of Texas campus. He was killed by police. 

In 1999, 17-year-old Dylan Klebold and 18-year-old Eric Harris -- armed with guns and pipe bombs -- killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado."

The art of losing isn't hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

Lose something every day.  Accept the fluster
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.

Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant
to travel.  None of these will bring disaster.

I lost my mother's watch.  And look! my last, or
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.

I lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.

---Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
I love) I shan't have lied.  It's evident
the art of losing's not too hard to master
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

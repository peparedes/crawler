"event","That's what I feel like yelling... just standing there ans screaming hate. Why? Easy, cuz I'm in a shit mood that I can not shake. I probably brought it on myself... How? I dunno... worrying about stuff that I shouldn't? What kind of stuff? Well, like... what my parents will think when I go visit my bf, what his parents will think when I go visit him, can I afford it, where will I stay, and other things...

My parents aren't exactly all for it... and my dad is strange... or at least acting strange about it... one thing really got me... I said that my dad was strange and my bf was like ""Yeah, I noticed although I wasn't going to say anything"" that just upset me... 

My mood went downhill really fast and I can't keep on task... sudoku was raping me tonight... and there was two of us doing the puzzle.

My finger is now killing me... I'm typing a lot with my left middle finger, because the knife attacked my left index finger, so it's been hard compensating for it and now the muscle at the base of my finger really hurts.... A lot of typing errors are being made... x.x driving me insane.

And... instead of caring about this, I should be looking into going to bed for the night, because I have classes at some point in time tomorrow. I am tired, but I don't want to go to bed in this crap mood... I don't know how to shake it... and now I want to cry... random mood to cry... this is about the third one tonight and it's driving me.

My bf has gone quiet again... I can't talk in any of the chat rooms I'm in... I just can't deal... ARRGH! Drives me...

I was writing earlier... surprisingly... but now that's gone... I've lost the want to do it... and now... now what? I am rambling in my LJ, making no sense.... jumping from topic to topic and back again...

well this never helped one bit.... screw it..."

"event","Hi... I am home, safe and sound... finally... I have a little story for you all, about a little adventure I had getting home... My 13 hour travel time turned into 36 and here is why...

On Wednesday night, I had one hell of a time getting to the airport. I called for a taxi and that never arrived. I called all the other taxi companies in the yellow pages and could not get one to come get me. Finally, at 11, Kate got convinced to bring me there. I got there at about 11:30 and the flight is supposed to leave at 12:30... so I was good right? Apparently... not so good as I thought. I lost my cell phone and then as I am checking in my bags, the dude tells me that I am on standby... because of the runway conditions, the plane can not take the full load as planned, and it's not looking too promising that I would get on.

 Well... I never got on... So the woman at the desk had to rebook my flight and do whatever... I basically had two options... I could fly out to Toronto the next morning and then stay in a hotel, or I could fly out to Halifax and stay in a hotel there. All because of the connection to Gander... 

So.... I choose to stay in Halifax. I got to stay in the Calgary Airport for the night, and not really get any sleep. The next morning, I fly to Ottawa... in executive class. I was asleep before we ever got off the runway. I slept most of that flight and then got off in Ottawa. Only to get back on the plane and fly to Halifax, again with this whole executive class deal... pretty sweet... 

So, I get to Halifax and go to one of the agents and am like ""What do I do about this whole hotel deal you are supposed to book me?""a d he gives me a look, but I give him my itinerary, and he's all like ""Ok! let me get this for you."" He gives me this voucher thing, tells me to get my bags and get some shuttle. So, I go and struggle with my bags and go find the shuttle... I end up staying in a Hilton... 

Then I got up the next morning and went to the airport. It's all this self-service ticket thing and I am trying to get mine and the screen is going ""I can't get your information."" There was this guy helping people and I am like ""I can't get my ticket and I don't understand."" He looks at my itinerary and tells me to go in the Executive line and I am like ""Oh..."" So, then I got all ready and flew into St. John's this morning. I only had about maybe 30 minutes in the airport before we boarded a pencil and flew to Gander...

 So... other then the whole cell phone deal, it ended up being a nice adventure... I got online to check my mail... I received an e-mail from Kate... She found my cell phone! Thank the Lord!

It's good to be home... finally... wee... thats my adventure for you all..."

I got about 10 hours before I got to get up and if I sleep for all of that, well... I WON'T sleep for all of that, but if I try to, it'll kill my body and then I have to work 8 hours tomorrow and I'll be thrown off. And that just will not work.


and and and and and and and and and and and and and and there's only 7 days before I am back home again. I can not wait. :D It's going to be great. I just wish I could take the boyfriend with me. :( Oh well, we've surrived long distance this long, we can keep going after I move."

"event","ARRGH. My mood is friggin bouncing around tonight! One minute I'm perfectly happy and content, the next I am ready to cry. What the hell is wrong with me?!

&gt;.&gt; I'm ready to dance to ""Where The Blacktop Ends"" and ""One Way Ticket"" but yet... ready to sit here and cry at the same time... I am so confused. And I don't know what to do. I wish I had warmer clothes. A walk would be nice, but it kinda snowed here today. Like a nice bit. According to the weather network, we got about 10 cm (about 4 inches). And it is like -9C and the windchill makes it feel like -19C. Joy... and I shoveled snow today with only jeans a sneakers on. Legs just about froze. So, yes. I can not go walking because of the lack of clothing. I will have to find some way to bundle up tomorrow, when I leave my house to go pick up my external hardrive and some juice. Hmm... I will have to fins a way. But, I still lack boots. which sucks. but, then again, 11 days and I'll have my boots back.

On that note... I started packing today. I bought those space saver bag things, where you vacum the air out of em, reducing things down. They work wonders. I have two done u and packed away... in my small suitcase. I predict that I will be a-ok with packing everything into my suitcases to take home. I have like four more of these bags and should be able to get all my towels and my blanket and pillow into them and then into my suitcases. We were thinking at first that I was going to need to send home a package, but we will see.

I might be buying myself a silver, 2BG ipod nano this week, after I get paid. I am still thinking about it, but I think I can afford it. And I want one before I go back home, because then, I can listen to it on my way home. You know, long flights and waits at the airport... might want something. I like my music and would listen to it all the time if I could. (I can't at work. ;_;)

Yes... so thats that for today... wee...."

"event","Ok... I am about to update this and I don't knw what kind of mood I am in. Like... work was not the greatest and my muscles -hurt- but yet I think I am ready to bounce off the walls... I think I have my boyfriend to thank for that. It's great to be able to come home and him be online and me say ""I've not had the best day"" and him to just make things better... make me smile.

So, yes... today I put in my two weeks notice at work. If I get the transfer between now and November 7th, they will let me know and I will go to work at the Cotsco out home. If they don't hear, then I don't get the transfer and I go home to live with my parents. I'm fine with this either way, since my plan was to go home and live with my parents anyways.

I got word yesterday that I am definatly going to be back in school in January and I am excited about that. I am going to finish my degree in biochemistry and I am thinking about minoring in French, seeing if I can't get my bilingual status. That might open some doors for me here and I like that idea.


Umm... well... umm... I should be sleeping... but I am not sure if I am tired or not... so... anyways... here I go."

Just gotta say... looked at my friend's page... was covered in posts from Wolfzero and as I was reading them, I was going ""I don't give a shit..."" and didn't finish reading them... I guess me and him just grew apart really fast...

I've been writing on and off and I am worndering if I should start using LJ as a place to post stuff... I think it would be interesting... if, say, once a week, I posted a story or a chapter for people to read... and comment on if they wanted to. Or not if they didn't want to.

""No man is worth your tears. Even if he is, he wouldn't make you cry in the first place.""

These two quotes have been on my mind since Dan made me cry the other night. The first is from a song, and the second one is something I have heard a couple times. But, they basically convey my feelings right now. And, even though he doesn't read this, Dan... YOU SUCK! You lied to me, you led me on and you hurt me. But not anymore. Because a) You're not worth my tears and b) I refuse to cry over someone who thinks he's all that.

"event","Ok, I have come to the conclusion that, even though I am not a klutz, no matter what I work at, I will come home with injuries. Always. I am currently sporting two band-aids on my right hand from injuries at work today, as well as a cut on the other hand that does not require a band-aid, but hurts whenever it comes in contact with anything. I have a band-aid on my ring finger. Now, this is not that bad of an injury. Just a random cut from a box. But it took out some skin and cut it enough to bleed.

The other is wrapped around my hand, because the injury is on the palm of my hand, right under my pinky finger. I took some boxes back to the baler today, and as I was opening the door, it nipped a bit of my hand between it and the box bin. It gathered the skin up into the little mound and then it turned into a blood blister-ish thingy. But, as it was already punctured (because the skin stretched and ripped when it got nipped), it started to bleed almost right away. And so, it hurt a lot right after and I can't grip anything well. It hurt a nice bit because I kept hitting it when I unloaded carts for people and then when I had to puch carts in. :/

The cut on my other hand it just one I got from a box, while doing a box run. It's on the side of my finger, at the second knuckle. So, reverytime I rub my finger over it, I can feel it and it sometimes hurts. It's all good. At least is't not burns, right?"

I'm still jobless, and been having second thoughts about the break up... actually had to leave the network he's on... it hurts when I don't know what I feel or want anymore... of course, I didn't exactly tell him that. I mean, it was all fine at first. We got over it (or I did and he seemed to) but then, something changed in me. And yeah... it just turned all weird. It doesn;t help that I just moved here and don;t really know anyone to hang out with, nor have I met some new dude that I think I can hit it off with. I'm just usually sitting around the apartment with my bro's girlfriend and then with him and his friends when they come over.

We went to see Clerks II last night. I enjoyed it, was good times. Wasn't sure if I was going to, because I didn't like the first one. But it was all good, hanging out with my bro's friends and watching a movie I actually laughed at. I have never had a theater experience like the one I had last night. There was no freaking out if someone made a sound during the movie, and they cheered at things that were making references to other movies the dude had made. It was all good, tho. I had fun.

Now, I just need a job and a life. Hmm... Here's for hoping."

I felt like shit, because as much as I tried to explain that it was me that had changed, he blamed himself. I was so upset over that, because it was something in me that had changed, something in me that I can't explain. I just stoped caring about the relationship, stop caring that I missed his calls. And it hurt to act. I just couldn't go on acting that it was all fine and dandy between us, so finally I told him. And then he blamed himself. After we hung up, I sat on my bed and cried. Then I went hanging out with some of my co-workers.<br /><br />My roomate and I were getting ready to go to bed, and she was drunk. She was talking about how it wasn't too bad to get drunk and I told her that it didn't sound like it and that right then and there, I almost wished I was. She was like ""Talk to me."" cuz she knew something was up. I explained it to her, told her everything, even tho she knew some of the stuff before, as we had talked. After, she was like ""We're doing a shot!"" I kinda laughed at her, but then she grabbed my hand and pulled me downstairs. I didn't put up much of a fight. We got to the kitchen and Ash was screaming ""She's doing a shot! She's doing a shot!"" We ended up getting pictures of Ash and I taking a shot of vodka. My first real drink. Then she gave me some fruitopia and added a shot of vodka to that. I drank that and she mixed me a drink of fruitopia, vodka and rum. I drank that. My first real drinks, even tho I had been thinking of trying some anyways. I guess I just had to be in the right mood, and I was last night. While we were drinking (Ash was having some with me), we ended up talking and I told her things that I probably wouldn't have had I not had the drinks.&nbsp; I got a bit tipsy, as it was my first drinks and elavation makes the effects of alcohol all that much more worse (I am living in the mountains). It was a bit funny. I don't regret it. And I love what Lesley said to me last night. ""Don't drink over some guy, drink cuz your girlfriends are here.""</p>
<p>So... that was&nbsp; my night. Well, that and the fact that I walked to Petro for ""comfort food"" with a guy who was tipsy and a girl that was drunk. That was a bit funny. Oh well. Thats that.</p>"

"event","Ok... What a day I have had... Where to start? This day has been... eventful... to say the least. I have been... going out of my mind for days... What with Rin coming and all. BUT! Let's start off and list the events.

Event 1: Got a phone call, offering me work away. I, of course, accepted it. That means... I move across the country in two weeks. I am so excited. Was... soooooooooo excited.

Event 2: Got in a car accident on the way to the airport. Everyone is ok. My friend, who was driving, got hurt, but not seriously. She has pain in her back and neck, and hip. It was a really scary time.... and to know that if my friend hadn't seen the guy, I would not be writing this now, and maybe never... yeah... freaks me out. What happened, we were turning left, in a turning lane and the signal light on, across three lanes of traffic. Two lanes stopped to let us go, so my friend started to edge out, making sure nothing was coming down the ramp, from the cross-town arteriole, into the third lane. She never saw anything and started to go. Then, all of a sudden, a black SUV comes speeding out of nowhere. My friend sees him, puts on her brakes... slams into him. We don't move, he goes FLYING across the intersection, past the curb and the sidewalk, up onto the grass. Yeah... the driver's side of the car took the impact. Myself and the other passenger was ok, but my friend had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.

Event 3: I got to the airport and met Rin. Oh man... what a time I was having. Here was my friend back in the hospital, her mother there with me and waiting for Rin to get in. I was going out of my mind, didn't know what to do. Just had been in a car accident, still in shock.&nbsp; The flight was delayed a half hour. :( Then... she was the last one to get off and they wanted to send her trough customs again, to check her bags out... just a random bag check, but still. We finally got out and all the fun times...

Event 4: I went to work and passed in my two weeks notice. That was weird... cuz I was still in shock form the accident, and Rin being here. Took me forever to get myself calmed down and get it wrote, then I went into work and haded it in and... phew... yeah... 

Now... I need to pack my clothes, get my things ready to be brought out home, to mom and dad's house, and I need to buy some things before I go... the next two weeks are going to be crazy insane weeks. I ahve to work on top of all of this and I am not sure how everything is going to go... 

I am surprised that I have no crashed yet... I just need to... get over the shock. Ok..."

"event","I am going out of my mind! I am so excited! Tomorrow, in less then 24 hours, Rin arrives! I can not wait!! AHH!!! Wee!!! Oh man... there is no way to calm me down... at all... and I have to work til close tonight. I am going to be bouncing off the walls!!! It's going to be an insane night tonight. AWEE! I wonder who else in the the drive-thru with me... I know who is working in the kitchen...

AND! I got a couple phone calls about work away. I feel really really good about the one I had today... and it's manking my nervous... adding to the allready abundant energy I have... I seriously am going to be bouncing off the walls tonight. This job, if I get it, I start in about two weeks. He has to give me two weeks so I can give my current work two weeks notice. So... that would mean... me moving in about two weeks-ish. 

AHH THE ENERGY THAT I HAVE!"

"event","Ok... I swear... if someone else tries using Rin to guilt trip me into staying, I am going to flip! Someone else even says anything mildly guilt inducing about Rin, I will freak! I have had enough of this!<br />
<div align=""justify""><br />It's not like I don't feel bad enough. Here I have been, for months telling her to come here, that I would do everything I could to help her get here, found a place for her, prayed like crazy for it to work out, worried and hoped that it would work out. And... to be like ""You're coming and a month later, i'm going to leave you."" makes me feel really bad as it is. But, I just feel the need to go away. I can't explain it... but I just really feel right in going, really need this. And... people have tried using Rin to guilt trip me, have said things that have made me feel guilty about leaving... Rin keeps telling me that if I have to go, go. That she isn't upset that I want to go. Yes. it'll suck that we can't spend more time together, but... things are not exactly the way we planned it, anyways.<br /><br />So... No more using friends as a guilt tripping method to get me to not move! Thats that!<br /><br /></div>

"event","Thus commences my job hunt. I have looked and applied for a few jobs away... Hoping to find more of interest tomorrow, to apply again for.  I really want to work in a hotel... 'Hospitality'. Maybe my McDonald's customer service experience will help me out... I hope so anyways. The store manager promised to give me a good reference. Yay!

Now, thats not to say that hospitality is the only thing I am looking at. I am searching everything in the city that my brother is living in. Most I can find is managerial positions, something I don't have experience in. I don't have experience in retail at all, so... yeah. I will keep looking.

I should look into getting my First Aid training... hmm... this would be good. Maybe if I call my friend, who does such things, she will be able to tell me, and help me figure out about getting it. Or maybe just contact the organization she volunteers with. I know they do it. Hmm... Ideas, Ideas."

"event","Ok... first things first... I fianlly admitted to myself that I was not happy with the fixed shift I am on. I listed off everything I didn't like about it. The bad now out-weighs the good. The reasons I first went into it over, have seemingly disappeared. I figured this out Monday night... Tuesday evening I was in having a meeting with the store manager at the mother store. She told me that there was no problem and that I could be back to the mother store week after next. Thank goodness.

Next thing... I am heading home this weekend... Tomorrow night, to be exact. Kinda nervous about this weekend... and I have a feeling one of two things is going to happen:
1) I am going to want to stay, not come back here.
2) Get into a yellfest with my dad and not want to stay.

Dad is against my boyfriend and I... He's said some rude/nasty comments about it... It hurt, and I need to let him know... I just am not sure how it is going to turn out.

Next thing... You know the saying ""Want something to bad you can taste it""?? Well... ok... I have three things... Rin coming here... I want that so bad... and it's supposed to happen in two weeks, so YAY!

The next thing... my boyfriend coming to visit me... oh lord, what a dream I ahd about that last night/this morning. And... I think about that a -lot-... almost as much as I think about moving... and thats the third thing... I am ready for a change in my life, and I want to move away... across the country... and well... it seems to be on my mind most of my waking hours nowadays... I am thinking of July... we'll see how that goes."

"event","I was at work today... and I heard the song ""What's Left Of Me"" by Nick Lachey and the lyrics 'I'm half the man I thought I would be, but you can have whats left of me' really got to me. Especially the first part. And... I know that this is not what the song is about, but it got me thinking. Just... about life in general, and where I am... and I realised, that no, I'm not the girl/woman I thought I would be... but I don't regret what decisions I made that brought me to where I am. No, I am not the doctor I thought I would be... but apparently you have to go through a lot more then I had first thought you did. But thats all ok. No, I am not curing cancer... Heck... I'm probably helping more people get it then anything...

But... there has been so many changes in the past year... I never imagined I'd be where I am today... but there is nothing I regret about what decisions I made to get here. Now, that is not to say that I don't regret things. There are two really big regrets in my life... one of them life-changing, one of them not so much...

And I ahve no idea why I wrote this... I think I just needed to get it out, write it down... heh."

"event","I HATE MONDAYS! And, no, it is not because it is the day after the weekend. At least, that is not the direct reason, there many be some indirect reason, such as, it's the day after the weekend and so,m shouldn't be too busy at work, so there's a shit schedule.

Ok... why do I hate Mondays then? Because, I am the only person in the kitchen at work, from 7 am to 11 am. Now, this might not seem bad... but... Trying to deal with breakfast customers, do the 'prep' (make salads and fajitas and such, set kitchen up for lunch... it just really drives me. Changeover -never- goes well. I can never seem to get the frozen out and put down in time. It all has to be done before 11 am... right before the next person comes on. And... as it is only me and the manager working, there is no way she (yes... there's only one male manager at our store) and she's the one taking orders, so... 

I hate working on Mondays.... drives me insane."

"event","OK... Since it has been over a month since I have updated, I think I will just update... Been thinking of updating for the past few days... heh. Ok... here goes.

Life has gotten a little less hectic, what with school finally over (I passed my course) and that no longer on my mind constantly. I have fixed shifts at work now, getting almost 40 hours a week. I open kitchen Monday to Friday, and it's not bad. I'm enjoying it so far.

Right after exams were over, I went home for a week. I really really needed that time off, to just sit back and relax, have nothing to worry about. I ended up woth 8 days off, spending Easter Sunday at my friends, doing my exam with her on Easter Monday, then going home that Tuesday. It has really helped me calm down about a -lot-. I am no longer worried about what may or may not happen in September, or August, for that matter. I have accepted that there are many uncertainties in my life right now. I may not be going back to university in September, because if I am not in the faculty that I want to be in, I can't really do any of the required courses, and then it is nothing but a waste of time and money.

I have been thinking about going away, for work, but I haven't decided on that yet. I want to wait awhile. I have two reasons. One being the fact that I want to wait untila really good friend of mine is safely here, in this province, and the other being that I want to wait for my letter from the university, telling me wether or not I am into psychology. No, I'm not going to get into the stuff about my friend. It's too much. But, I will tell you why I am waiting for the letter. I want to go away knowing that I can stay away fro work as long as I want to. If I go now, and I get my letter in july saying I am in, I will drop everything there, come the end of August. I want to know that I am not in and go away for however long it takes me to figure out what it is that I want to be doing instead.

After being able to accept these things, I have been feeling a -lot- happier lately. Been able to talk to the boyfriend a lot, even got to call him (he lives in a different country), my friend is home from India and been able to hang out with her, have a laugh. Getting excited a lot lately. Oh man... *bounces around excitedly*"

"event","So, anyways, this week has been absolute crap. My computer has crashed and I haven't got it fixed yet. Work's been total crap mainly. I broke down Tuesday night. The first time I ahve ever felt that way at any of my work. And I mean I -broke down-. I was basically crying and I told one of my managers things about me that I have told no one, or only my boyfriend. It's been horrible. Yesterday at work, I was in a bad mood all day. They put me in kitchen when I did not want to be in it. it was a brutal, crazy busy day, and we were all ready to curse and scream by the time we got off.

I have been absolutely stressed over the computer, work, hours at work, mid-term and assignment thats coming up next week, and because of the bombings in India. I know that last part may seem strange randomly coming from a Canadian, but, my friend is over there and no one had heard from her since the day before the bombings, so we've been kinda worried. She's ok tho, I got word from her last night and she was no where near the bombings. But yeah... crazy, stressed times.

My mood has been really weird, because for a few days I was what I would call unfeeling, just existing, and it was all fine. But now, the mood has gone back down to crappiness. Today hasn't been too bad. I really haven't done much, though. Went to WalMart and ended up seeing a couple old friends. Was kinda nice. But theres been no real improvements on my mood.

And I really do not wish to work this friggin overnight tonight. I have about a half hour to get ready and get to work. I know one of the people that will be on tonight and I am glad he's going to be there, and I know what manager is on. It just happens to be the one that I talked to the other night, the one where I broke down. So it might be all good. I just wonder who will be in the kitchen with me... I hope a decent worker or someone who I can joke around with and someone who will make the night a good night. Hmm... we'll see. But I better head off..."

"event","I think I wish to know what kitty is at but I am too tired/sore to move and find out... Heh. Just got in from work. My ankles and my feet hurt. They are so sore. Being on your feet for long periods of time HURT! *nods* So yeah... anyways... I closed counter tonight. It was interesting because... well because it was my first time, I had someone training someone else and they did a lot of my work for me, every time I tried to do something I would get smacked with customers, and it felt like I didn't do anything. I was late getting out, but meh, because they cut me back an hour and I didn't want them too. I wasn't supposed to close counter, I was supposed to pre-close kitchen. But, yeah, something happened and I ended up out on counter. It wasn't too too bad.

Today I didn't freaking want to move. It was insane. And then the snow started and I was -not- moving unless I -had- to... like to go to work. And then the snow stopped, so it was all good. But then... it started again. It couldn't make up it's mind. By the time I got off again, it had stopped. But it had been wet, sticky snow that had been falling, and the roads weren't plowed, so I was walking home in about 3 or 4 inches of snow. That's a crazy amount when it's wet and sticky and you are sloushing through it to get home at 12:30 in the morning. AND I DON'T WANT ANYMORE!!!!

And so yeah... todays been a lazy day. And nothing really interesting was happening. Talked to my boyfriend an awful lot. My mood hasn't dropped, a very good thing. It's not improved back to crazed, happy, dancing lover or anything, but it's not going backwards either. It was pretty good today. Not great, but not bad either. Anyways, I'ma stop blabbin about nothin and most liekly sleep..."

"event","Yeah... ok... confused is probably the best way to describe my feelings right now. Not confused as in not understanding something, more confused as to what I feel. I'm frustrated, nervous, worried, yet releived, maybe kinda distressed, a bit of happiness in there... it's really weird and confusing. Hard to deal with...

I'm all frustrated over my internet. It's now acting funny after I moved it and thats driving me insane. The someone seemed to be trying to push something on me, and it kinda seemed like my boyfriend was in on it too (mot purposfully) and I knew the diff, but it just threw me right off. And then I got mad at said dude and started accusing my bf. wtf is wrong with me?

Ok, so then, I accused my bf, then he stopped talking to me. And then I was so freaking nervous and worried that he was mad at me and that he was just not talking to me because of that. So I went off to clean my room, found myself very restless and blah because of this.

So I came back and talked to him. And he's not mad. And so there is my feelings of relief.

I am distressed over... a load of crap going on around me. Work isn't the greatest, Shave For The Brave and solicitation crap, and I am so behind in my course. I feel bogged down.

I am not sure about the happiness... it's just one big jumble of feelings and emotions that I am feeling and needed to get out without actually talking to anyone."

So yeah... I'm not really in a mood today. I want to be out and about but I don't want to move from this house... does that make sense? I'm actually feeling better today then I have in the past week. I really needed these past few days off from work... it hasn't been going so well.

Even thinking about my boyfriend hasn't helped me much. Weirdness.... Usually it helps to improve my mood, but at work, it only ends up turing into me wishing I was home talking to him...

The only reason, is because of half a lap I had to do to get to the change rooms. I walk on an indoor track at my university. So it's all good. Then I went to chemistry, and hehehe, wrote a friend a letter instead of paying attention. Then I fell asleep on a bench before my math class. Went there, and learned. Then I came home, ate, got on irc... wireless got evil and kept disconnecting me.. But oh well...

YAY! I got to talk to WZ tonight! I was happy! and now I'm hyper happy! But tired at the same time.. so I'm soon going to bed.. So yeah.. nothing special happened today..

I can;t wait to read those! But I got to finish one book before I start another, so thats why I have to finish the Harry Potter one.

"event","Ok, so last night wen ok after. I finished my chemistry stuffs and relaxed a bit before going to bed. It was an ok night. Today was ok, I guess. Chem lab was a bit long, but we were in pairs, so it was all good. Tutorial was helpful. I learned something! Then I had a math test. I think I had a clue going into it, but I was finished it early, so I looked over it about a  million times and changed some answers and things.. I think I did ok,. I HOPE I did ok... Then i went to physics, to see if the prof was going to tell us where we had to take our test... it's posted on the web, so I left after I ate my dinner, which was about 10 mins into the class. Then I waited for a friend that never showed up for her book, then I went and walked 4.3 km. I felt really good after that, and wants to do it again tomorrow.

Tonight I just relaxed and bummed on the internet, as well as worked on one of my stories. So it was an ok night... Kinda.. Man o man. I was on irc, chatting away and WZ ain't there! ;_; He always makes me happy when I'm not so happy. And right now I'm not so happy... I was talking to someone and we mentioned the time, and the time difference. And I'm in a time zone thats a half hour in the difference, instead of an hour (YES! There are those types of time zones!) And then, I was joking as to how this was the second one I had to tell about such time zones.. the last never believed me for a long time. So then all of a sudden, we were talking about opinions af Americans and how opinions of others don't count.. Whoever came up with that was evil, cuz Everyone's opinion matters! And then! They were talking about flaming Americans and then they were talking about fighting and I was shit.. I technically started this and they're being stupid. So I got a bit frustrated with them and said ""Screw this"" and left. and Yeah... Cuz I mean.. Geez.. Opinions matter, and don't flame Americans just because they don't believe everything you tell them thats true right away... I've noticed I can say a lot of lies on irc and ppl will believe it in a second, but the minute you start telling the truth, they question you. I haven't told lies to anyone I've liked on there, but People that creep me out, or I don't think I like, I can say weird things (Like Xlandia.... Long story, but There's someone that knows what I'm talking about)and they'll believe me. So yeah.. weirdness that annoys me.. Thats why I'm annoyed now.

Ok, this is the last thing I'm doing before going to bed.. I'm dropping.. ok so yeha.. that was my day/night.."

This assignment is not hard, but for some reason I read, think I got to do it one way, get half way done that way and find out it's NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DONE THIS WAY! So here I am, being frustrated with myself over it. I had to take a break, but I soon go to go back and finish the assignment as well as do a lab.. I don't think the lab is going to be too hard.. I think there's only 3 questions to it.. easy shit.. Titration's. Thats fun stuff if you don;t screw it up. 

GRR ARRGH! My explorer keeps going to the other webpage I have opened on me, refusing to let me work on my journal! ARRGH! And ARRGH! I'm trying to show a friend the pic I now have as a background and it's not on the website anymore.. thats weird.. anyways...

Today was an interesting, not half bad day. I went to the Girl's group that I've wanted to join but couldn't cuz of time conflicts. It was all figured out for today and I was HAPPY! and then I missed physics cuz of it, but oh well.. I don't care.. not really.. and Then I walked to the hospital after and that went well! And then the last hour before I got my ride home, didn't pass that slow.. it was an ok hour.. although I never got to go get me some money after.. I'll do that tomorrow.

Well thats all for now.. I might be back to let out my chem frustrations again... w00t! I gots me somewhere to complain!"

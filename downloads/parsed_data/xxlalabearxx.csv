<P><EM><FONT color=#33ccff>for the past 4 years something bad has happened around the holidays, death,sickness,accident, exct...i dont know what the fuck it is with me and my family...ok so i am begining to see that i am a very unlucky person, i dont know what it is but i have bad luck with alot of things....</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ccff>i hope christmas is a good turnout and not a huge let down...yea i know its a bad attitude to have well not really but lately ive been alittle down and out, things i hope and pray happen might not happen, there is one thing and one thing only i wished for to have on christmas and if it doesnt happen i unno what the hell to do...</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ccff>i never wanna give up on life, theres two people that i can say i live for, i dont care what other people think of me, and i never look to please people..but lately ive been wondering what i can do to make myself better to be around...i never dreamed i would ask that question to neone and im not asking neone on here im just venting...about what im thinking...</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ccff>then i think and wonder where i stand with people...my whole life ive stomped on things ive had, i hate myself for that, im blind to the world around me and all i ever really wanted was someone to help me out and help me through hard times and be there for me, and quide me when im wrong...ive never really had anyone actually care for me...i grew up alone, my brother was never there, nor was my father, my mom worked around the clock making sure we had food to eat and clothes to wear...she did the most amazing job ever and i wish one day i will some how beable to pay her back or show her how much it helped me out, and how much i really admire her for the work she did...</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ccff>i had three very important missing factors growing up, and it hurt me in the long run...i hate most of my past, i do have alot of sweet memories i could never possibly let go of, but being that my past was the way it was it held me back from learning alot of things that would have helped me in my life now...</FONT></EM></P>

<P><FONT color=#009900>another excitement is that in april or march my mom is sending matt and i to cabo ontop of our 18th birthday snowboarding trip...so im pretty damn excited well lets say ""im thrilled"" ... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc6600>for once in my life i have found something that makes me so happy, and that something i just cant let go of, hes helped me through some of the tuffest obsticals, and without him i dont know where i would be...over the past few years hes become a bestfriend to me, and eairlier on in my life best friends didnt exsist i guess i have a totaly different meaning behind a ""bestfriend"" hes a hero and someone i could never stop loving, my grandfather calls him my mirical sent to me for a reason, and a soul i cant let go of...and in so many ways i believe him, everytime i look at him theres so many things i wish i could say and so many things i wish i could do, but i choke up and loose my words....</FONT></P>

ive been sitting here thinking about random ass things and trying to
picture myself living life in my 20's yes i know that may seem alittle
weird but i am a person that thinks about weird things like that, i was
out talking to my mom and she wasnt as mad as i thought she would be
about running up her credit cards but yea...she got some other credite
statements and we had charged up like $100 more dollars, so im up to
like $375 but yea shes not going to make me pay it back like i thought
she would, instead she is ""solving the problem"" and getting me my own
credit card so i wont have to use hers on trips we go on and what
not....most people might go, oh she is so damn Spoiled but the truth of
the matter is as that im really not, i look at it this way, ""if i was
so damn spoiled and got everything i wanted and more i sure as hell
wouldnt be here today, i would have my own house, with housekeepers and
whatever else comes with it"" but in all reality i WILL NEVER have
housekeepers and if i do they will be at my house once a week if there
lucky, that is what we are for =) haha...right now im not the best
housekeeper cuz i choose not to be but when im married or whatever that
will all change in a heart beat, cuz by then i will have a husband to
cook for so that right there will make me take the best cooking classes
available, my own house that i can do anything that i want to,
""rearanging and decorating"" is one of my favorites, but right now i
dont have my own house, so in that case i cant just one day say ""hey im
moving this there and buying this to go in that room"" cant do it....so
yes thats why i sometimes try and picture myself living life older then
i am now....also today i was driving back from the town of sebastopol
getting my mom some things from the store and i was getting ready to
turn at the stop light that will take me back to her house and i
thought to myself really how thankful i was to have my car, and how
thankful i was to have the people i do have right now in my life,
because without a car to depend on and people you can turn to at any
time u need them to talk to or whatever life is a shitty thing, a car
can allow u to take off and go somewhere if and when you need to and
people u love and trust can help you through the worse times life
shares with you...<br>
i think i have said most of the big things i was thinking about right then and there but trust me theres so many more ""major<br>
&nbsp;things on my mind but i unno ill save my feelings for later on...<br>

i went to la, and it was yet another shit ride home, we didnt get to my
house this morning tell 5:00am yeah i kept taking wrong turns and
everything....u know its like this ""no matter what i do i always fuck
up"" in other words I AM NO NAVAGATOR!&nbsp; yeah every trip is always
so interesting, but neways we got to aunt lori and uncle nicks house
friday night at about 10:30pm got up eairly saturday morning and took
off to watch joe and lexx fight in one of there judo tournaments, that
was a blast, i was able to be there for both of my brothers, not to
mention it was lexxs first tourny n he took 3rd!!!!! yay!!!!! i was
happy i was able to go...and lets see oh&nbsp; yea joe took 1st place
so it was all good....</span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153); font-style: italic;"">hmmm then that
night we stayed at matts dads house and yes that was interesting, but
not as bad as i thought it was going to be...we went to see the movie
doom, and didnt get back home tell 12o'clock ish that morning or night
or whatever you wanna call it, n the first thing i did was go to sleep,
and have some crazy dreams that scared the shit out of
me....haha....and then in&nbsp; the morning matt swares he came in to
wake me up and see if i wanted to go with him but i guess i was in some
dead sleep or something but i woke up and he wasnt there so i was all
weird about it cuz i didnt know where he went and his dad was looking
around for him, but yea i just kinda felt weird about being there in a
house im really unfimiliar with it just makes me feel weird....</span><br>
<span style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 0);"">the trip all
in all was pretty good, i mean theres things i wanted to do and places
i would have loved to take matt but it didnt happen, not enough time
and it sucked cuz i really did have stuff planned out in my head but i
guess theres always next time, if there ever is a next time....the way
back home all i wanted to do was cry, i just got to thinking about so
many things and some things i couldnt even figure out what they were i
was thinking about, and the rest was just how this trip would have been
so much better, and how much i ador, admire, and love the person i was
so fortunate to take this trip with, and how im trying my hardest to
make things better, and try to relax...but its so hard cuz these
feelings i have i just wish i could flat out tell them face to face and
i would if i knew he wouldnt react in a bad way but right now its so
hard to tell...everything feels like its gunna be okay and all my heart
wants to do is make everything okay, and for me i just wanna let him
know really how i feel instead of saying ""oh everythings ok"" or ""im not
thinking really about anything"" and if i am its always something totaly
different then what i am really thinking, but how am i suppose to know
how he is going to react if i told him how much i love him....how am i
really supose to know??</span><br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"">hahaha
the highlight of my trip was petting the turtles....""we where being
turtle hunters"" at the commons AHAHAHA i found out and saw the true
definition of TURTLE-HEADS....</span>"

and what not, told him what i got matt last night and what i wanna put
in his stocking this year for christmas, yet again i made my grandpa
cry, i wasnt even meaning to he just cries when i talk about matt and i
weather its good or bad he thinks we are the most beautiful gift god
could ever give, god i hate times like this, here i am trying to talk
about happy thoughts of things i wanna do for him, and something i
wanna put in his stocking and he tells me this ""ever sence the day you
called me saying, grandpa i have a boyfriend now and i think i found
someone right for me"" and after that he described everything the exact
way i said it and it made me cry cuz this is someone i love, someone i
would do nething for, but ahhhhhhhh......i dont know why i had to get
that fucked up thought that he doesnt care nemore about me, when really
he did and i think he still does, but omg....how could i fucking do
this to myself, i found someone who i do love to pieces, i found the
one person that makes me feel good about who i am, i found the one
person that my grandfather accepts to know end, which has never
happened, and finialy someone i can apriciate every little thing he
does for me and not have the feeling of ""did he just do this to make me
feel better"" or ""am i going to regret this later on""<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i was so scared he wasnt coming home, i was so
scared he was gone forever, and i was so scared he went down there and
would never speak to me again, what i did is something i can never take
back, even though people go ""oh dont worrie about it just brush it off
your shoulders its no big deal you didnt do anything with any other
guy"" me i cant brush it off this is someone i would give my life for, i
would jump infront of a semi-truck for him to protect him, i would
stand infront of a gun for him, if someone wanted to take his life they
would have to get through me first, he goes i go too, they would have
to take my life before they took his, just like at the hostility
concert, if those guys wanted to swing at him they would have to swing
at me first, i stepped infront of those fuckers even though matt told
me to never do it, i did, cuz i love him and i didnt wanna ever see
anything happen to him, granite i was intimadated when they where
talking to there like 10 girlfriends telling them to fight me and
danielle and pointing to us yea i was alil intimadated cuz i didnt
wanna have to spend my night in a fight but i would if i had to....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well finaly this leads me back to me and grandpas
conversation, he asked me what my top wish is and i told him, i told
him that one day i wish that everything can go back to the way they
where when i was so happy i couldnt help myself, having everything be
ok again with the one person i love, then he asked me what i value most
in him and i told him everything that came to my mind and what i see in
him, he always tells me ""there isnt a night that goes by that i dont
pray for you two"" and he always says ""if i can accept one man as my
grandson it would be him"" how am i supose to choke down his every word?
i cant i just cant i ball my eyes out everytime he speaks such clear
words while hes crying, i asked him tonight ""grandpa your crying and
everything but i dont understand why you slur your words but when it
comes to matt and i you speak crystal clear"" he said ""because if theres
one thing in this world next to my wife that makes me more happy it
would be you and matt, you guys have blessed me"" but ok im gunna stop
there before i cry yet again, but yea i guess thats pretty much it....<br>

"event","<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"">do you ever find yourself talking to yourself when your driving about things that are on your mind?<br>
~well i do quiet often~<br>
do you ever think about everything you have going for you but look at them in the most positive way's possible?<br>
~i do~<br>
they may sound dumb but i do both those things almost every day, and
tonight was alittle different, okay dont get me wrong i love my mom to
no end but i just cant be around her that long, it almost kills me
inside to see my mother strugle the way that she has been for the past
3 years, my mom the one who gave me life the one i can tell anything to
and the one i love so much makes me sick sometimes, well not so much
that but i havent had a mom for along time, ALL my moms time is taken
up day by day and hour by hour, i hate it i absolutly hate it, she says
hurtful things to me that she could never take back, and she has dont
things that have hurt me so much to the point it almost costed me my
life, but i am one ""that learns to forgive"" i have almost fully no
questions about it forgiven everything she has ever put me through and
am working my heart out to move on with her and i's severed
relationship...my mom and i are constantly at eachothers throats
everytime we are together and i cant stand it, i come here hoping her
and i could work some issues out between us but it never fails ""fuck
you im through being a mother"" every time....<br>
this one leads me back to my first question about the talking to yourself when your driving well tonight i was driving and i got a txt message from matt and granite it was only ""hey"" it made my night just fine, tears rolled from my eyes, but i couldnt respond with what i wanted to say but hey its all okay now, and i just looked at the simple ""hey"" he sent me and i couldnt help but think yet once again about how much he means to me and everything i wouldnt mind doing for him....ok so tonight i drove off to get something to eat in a not so pleasent
move when the one person i would give my life for, the one i would do
anything in my power to make things okay, and to help out if needed,
the one i honestly could never live without pops into my head,
everything that is going on flashed through my head like lightning in
the night sky, and hit me like a thousand and one bricks of ice, i
thought to myself ""i dont know what he is going to think but the least
i am going to do is try and make his day tomorrow a bit britter then
the usual day"" so i did as ""mommy"" would say ""i set off on another
spinding spree"" and i did just that....saw things again that he had
mentioned to me he needed and all that jazzy stuff and i got them, my
goal YES PEOPLE I HAVE GOALS OF MY OWN TOO!&nbsp; ""i am going to learn
how to work on cars"" even if it kills me im gunna learn, in fact some
nights i find myself dreaming of working on cars and learning about
them..i may act like its ""yuckie"" but thats not how i really am, sit me
down with some nifty little spray cans and show me how to do it and ill
try my hardest to succeed....i am throwing away my old personality or
""ewww get away"" and im transforming into the personalitly that is deep
down inside ""fuck the bugs, fuck the spiders, and fuck the snakes, i
wanna get all into the greasy dirty sweaty mechanic shit"" yes i am
going to change in a few ways, and theres some people that tell
everyone that there is no way you can ever change yourself ""WRONG""
there are many ways u can change yourself, you will always and forever
be who you are, but theres always room for throw away flaws in your
personality, self image, exct, but you will always be the same person
you where the day you where born....<br>

all of the sudden am an emotional disaster i unno exactly why i am but
it sucks, i just sat down with a pen and paper and started writting a
poem that was suppose to be all happy and as i was writting it trigured
a bunch of horrible thoughts and memories from a phone call i had one
night with matt, it really sucks cuz the whole fight we had that night
then when my friends where trying to get me to look over and look at
him and omg....every single word we said that night is ringing in my
head and ahhhhhhh everything thats ever brought me down in my life is
coming back and i cant stop it....i walked outside and through down my
pen and paper and just started running as fast as my short legs would
let me but it didnt work, hyperventalation started in while i was
trying to consentrate on my breathing and trying to think of other
happy things but it just doesnt work right now, well im calming down
now but i just wish i knew why all of the sudden all this emotion is
being trigured, i hate thinking about bad things and the worse thing of
all is every single damn word being replayed in my head....what is this
just a game????<br>
im really not as dumb as i seem but ive found that when someone playes
with my head and my heart i begin to flip out but never in my life have
i ever had this happen.....its like i dont wanna go up to his house and
cry i dont know what im gunna do...i dont want him to see me like this
and i deffinatly dont want him taking this the wrong way and think that
im blamming him or hes a fault for this its just i dont know what to do
in this kind of situation....<br>
sometimes i thank god that im the way i am, i use to have so many
friends and now i dont and im totaly fine with that, i dont care what
my ""x-friends"" thought of matt cuz to me he has been my biggest
blessing, and my old friends just didnt understand just how much i
cared for him, and the fact that we would always ditch i really dont
care but god....and thats why i lost all the friends i use to have but
who cares cuz i never looked down on them for who they where with i
would never do such a thing but they did that to me....<br>
then ive been talking to someone i havent talked to in for such a long
time it seems ""jeremy"" and i unno him and i where just talking about a
bunch of different things and ahhhhhhhhh i just wonder sometimes if my
life is just a ""big joke"" <br>
i dont wanna loose my heart anymore and i have so much on my mind and i
just want things to go back to how they use to be but i cant just do it
at the snap of my finger, but i really dont wanna be everyones ""fool""<br>
sometimes i feel like everything is going just fine then something
happens and the last thing i want is nevermind im gunna stop right
there.....<br>

damn essay i have to write and praying i get accepted into the beauty
college i really wanna go to, yes it is what i want to do for awhile, i
would love to become an esthetician it would be so great and its not
only because of the money, its something i really want to do....then
there is life in 6 months on my mind, i am in a strong depate i talked
to my aunt and she wants me to pack my shit and move down there as soon
as i am done with my schooling but my whole goal was going down there
with money saved so i dont have to stress about my living situations
and what not, but then i look at it this way, i wont really have to
anyways but i wanna be able to feel good about myself and proudly say
""im supporting myself"" errrrrrrrggggggggggg yea im kinda going alil
crazy but ill be okay....<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"">hmmm then theres matt, last night
i was in a bitchy mood for a few reasons not really because of him,
well first off two nights ago i had a really great night, one of the
best nights ever, i wanted to tell matt everything im about to say and
one day i will if i really remember but yea here it is, well ok wait
""matt if u read this, this is what i wanted to say but as usual i was
scared your mom would get wind of it""<br>
the other night when i had you over it made me think about some things
and one of the big things was how much i miss having you around, just a
night we didnt go out and spend a bunch of money but it was a night of
smiles and laughter something we dont get that much nemore....it just
seemed the other night there was alot of tension and i am totaly
respectable about that cuz of jakes surgery, it didnt seem like u where
in the greatest mood and when you said ""im sorry if im being an asshole
to you"" i accepted your appoligy....yes i was disappointed about the
fact that we didnt get to go out to the movies as we had planned but
its fine, the biggest thing is though, i miss having you come out to my
moms every once in awhile, when u do it makes me feel good, n now
theres actually something kinda fun to do here besides come to get
money and leave ;) haha the hottub and i just wanna thank you for
spending that time with me here it made my night and my week....<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(153, 153, 0);"">so theres things in life i have
missed out on both as a child and now and for now its catch up time for
me in alot of areas...theres things in life i just cant live without
and people in life i admire in so many different aspects but i unno, i
just do so much thinking and not enough speaking sometimes but i unno
for me theres a time and a place to do my talking....yes everyone i am
a comfort freak if im not comfortable in a certain situation i shut up
and trip on my words but hey i dont care....well i do but i dont at the
same time....<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 153, 51);"">i just wanna some how some way
get all my feelings out on the table and just start over, the past has
been such a beautiful thing well most of it, but i think its nearing
the time and point to start over <br>
<br>
""the end of one chapter and the begining of another""<br>
<br>
let the past be the past and only the past theres only room to build a new clean future..<br>

have a feeling today is gunna be a really good day...i woke up pretty
energized and feeling rather lucky so we will see what happenes =) i
unno it was the weirdest thing, last night my so called step dad was
laying in his bed in the middle of the night literly choking to death i
mean i could hear it, it was creepy but yea i should be use to it by
now i mean he had a stroke and now he cant do anything for himself, so
that happened and i kept getting these weird thoughts in my head of
""god will he even make it through the night?"" i have never herd him
cough and choke that bad in his sleep but oh well....so then this
morning i wake up stretch and think to myself about this feeling i have
carried with me all this morning ""damn this is gunna be a good day, and
im really feeling lucky"" i unno i havent felt this way in a few months
so lets see if my day goes as planned.....then last night i had some
weird dreams but im not gunna go into depth but some were funny and
others were seriously great.....ok thats all....hope everyone has a

feel like this one is going to be kinda long but oh well if u feel like
reading it, its all up to you. okay well first off im at my mom's house
tonight yeah kinda shity but hey i guess its something i need to do
weather i like it or not, she is my mother but no he is not my
""biological"" father but i guess you can still count him as a step dad
even though i hate the thought of it but oh well ""allana deal with it
only a few more months to go"" </span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 153);"">hmmm so let's see i came home
and my mom wanted me to get the mail on my way in so i did, our
neighbor had came to me at the end of the driveway asking me to please
keep my eye out for her two missing dogs, so i said ""ok no problem"" so
here i am at my moms this afternoon knowing the stress and feeling of
having animals missing, shit there part of the family sometimes. a few
mins later i go driving down the driveway and all are dogs are barking
like crazy so i walk out to the back side of the property and there
they where, two beautiful dogs laying next to myshia, relief i felt
""yes i found the ladies dogs"" FUCK ARE MAIL CHICK SHE SUCKS!!! yea it
was the mail lady she was late delivering mail and she doesnt know how
to shut a damn gate behind her ugh! yea this lady had a package on her
porch, an open gate, and two lost dogs that could have gotten run over
if i hadent have found them, but hey there safe....<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 204, 255);"">ok so here is my main thought
of the night: is it wrong to feel like you have grown with, been
through everything together, seen it all together, basicly have
conquered the world it seems ""together"" is it wrong even though we
arent official or anything is it still wrong to have the feeling come
over you ""i just want to cuddle up right beside him or take a trip up
the the lookout just to feel safe and clooser to eachothers hearts and
talk, discuss whatever needs to come out?"" but i mean heres the other
thing sometimes when im beating myself up over something all i want to
do is express myself to him but in a way that truely shows the way i
feel for him deep inside my heart and god theres nights where im just
dying inside and i just wish i could rest my hand on his cheek and kiss
him beneath the night sky..may sound retarded to some but honestly i
dont care, this is one person that has saved me from so much bad shit
and someone that has transformed me into the better person i am now,
not the person i was 3 years ago. meeting him was the best thing i have
ever done and i told him this a few nights ago and he told me it was
very touching to hear me say that, but theres so much other stuff that
i wish i could just say to him, things i have told only one of my
friends and my stupid journal but god why do i always think ""omg what
if he doesnt really listen or what if he thinks that was just the
stupidest thing hes ever herd?"" i know its not like that and alls i
want is nothing more then to just be able to open up completely to him
and tell him anything and everything ive thought about sence ""july 15,
2005"" ever sence then my head has been a whirlwind of thoughts, and so
many feelings i never knew i would ever have, the feeling of love, and
the feeling of watching something you love so much you would give your
life for, be in such pain because of my own mistake. i have thought so
hard it hurts, i have searched my soul inside and out so many times i
cant even count and i faithfully promice everything will be different
and never will i ever make a mistake as terrifying as the one i did
before that almost caused me my whole world..i am growing older and i
know im not getting any younger i have so much more to live for and so
many more memories to create and i would give anything to open up and
just be myself once again...anything in this world, anything at all...<br>
<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"">my
grandmas trip was delayed yet another week, god she is someone so
unique i just love to watch her every move someone that truely has
amazed me ever sence i was a little girl, yup she is my grandpa and i
only get to see her maybe once a year if im lucky and god i miss her
like crazy, ive been so excited shes coming and something always keeps
on happening and it sucks. oh well thats life too. why cant life just
be easy for one day? it will never happen and thats fine i guess but
errrrrrrrr i want her to come to california where she belongs =)<br>
<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 153);"">my
grandpa is home again but god he worries me, every day sometimes every
second of the day i am constantly thinking about him, what would happen
if ann where to give me a really terrible phone call? i just dont know,
he is 89 years old and the best grandpa on the planet, a best friend,
and a hero, one of the two people in this life of mine that i can
truely say ""i am thankful to have you in my life"" i just wish i could
have these two people forever and ever in my heart locked up tight, i
wish death could never even take them away from me but its the only
thing that can, even when he does go he will always be in my heart. i
have spent countless hours in my short life ive lived so far, talking
him tell his eyes cloose, hugging him tell he wants to fall over,
crying cuz i am sitting there watching him cry, and writting poetry
about one of two people i love more then anything, i just wish i could
read every poem i have ever written about him but its almost impossible
i would get to many ""what did you just say"" or ""i didnt quiet hear
that"" but i would still do it if i could.<br>
<span style=""font-style: italic;""><font size=""3""><span style=""color: rgb(204, 204, 255);"">so
im thinking of posting some poems i have written about different things
in life, and things that have held me together as a person, and yes it
was a request from someone that reads my livejournal and also something
i have kinda been wanting to do but im not gunna post to many cuz
things i write have strong meaning to me and are kinda personal so im
gunna keep them to a minimum...<br>

"event","sence ive been home today which hasnt been that long sence like 630pm
my mom has been constantly yelling and screaming at me, this fucking
sucks im like all BLAHHHH and i want nothing more then to leave this
hell hole but yea im just gunna wait out the storm and see what
happens...i mean having her look me in the eyes and say ""i am through
being your mother your nothing but trouble to me"" doesnt make me feel
any better....and some people wonder why i never dress really nice n
this is the reason for instance yesterday i came home to get a dress
and she looks at it then looks at me ""oh this one will make u look
really sluty"" like my god damn goal is to look like white trash or
something???? i dont get it....i mean i dont think ive ever seen her
this angrey aboutn god knows what in my whole life and it sucks cuz i
dont know why the fuck shes so angrey and ahhhhh i just cant handle
this anymore im gunna go crazy or end up in the hospital again or
something and i really dont want that ever again in my whole life....i
am so unwelcomed here like its against ""her law"" for me to stay here in
a place i use to be able to call HOME now its like i dont want anything
to do with it but at the same time i do...i unno....oh and get this
haha im almost 18 and i have a FUCKING BED TIME!!! in my car but i
refuse...unless she wants me to run out of gas or something running my
car just for the heater all night long AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH......
k then the other night matt and i had a chilling phone fight but that
all passed, lexx took me home after the football game and granite i was
scared to go near matt fearing i would cry and fearing he meant every
word he said and the way he said it but he didnt, the first thing he
did was come down to lexxs car and give me a hug and say sorry...that
meant something to me....then we went to the lake at like midnight and
had a really beautiful talk....we cuddled and talked about how we
wanted things to start over but from square one...i told him some of
how i feel for him...some of the things on my mind....some of how some
of the things he says hurts me....lets just say i spilled alittle bit
of everything....but still not as much as i would have liked
to....everytime we venture up to the lake and sit together beneath the
starry night sky a feeling comes over me and it amazes me and makes me
think deeper about the real reason why i wake up each and every
morning, its him....and being with him under the starry night sky with
the lake in the distance makes me think so hard about everything thats
been going on, his tender touch and the everlasting stillness of just
him and i in the middle of nowhere is a wonderful feeling i cant
explain, he told me over and over again dont ever be afraid to cry
infront of him, but for some reason i feel so out of place when i do, i
hate showing such weakness to issues i may not want people to know hurt
me on the inside, but in a sence its a better feeling to beable to go
up there just him and i and get it all out, cuz up there, theres
nowhere to run and hide when i shed every last tear, and i do cry
almost every night but i usualy choose to hide it from everyone, so i
run and hide mainly in the bathroom, cuz so many feelings come over me,
but its not that they are feelings that bring me to my knees in a
depressed way, some are feelings that come over me of how thankful i am
to have certain things and certain people in my life, tears of joy, and
tears because of certain things that have been said to make me think a
few more times, so theres happy tears and said tears then theres the
tears that i dont know exactly why there there but yea...i unno if any
of this made any sence at all but i need to go before something else
happens"

was a tuff day for me....well first off eairlier on at the mall matt
and i kinda got into it n it always hurts me everytime we exchange
unkind words or whatever....then he went to his moms nail appointment n
i started feeling really sick i mean blahhh....so i went to bed i
couldnt handle staying up much longer so i layed down for like 2 hours
n omg wowah my stomach was in such huge knots n i was so sick....<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"">so my biggest thing im working on
right now is getting over my anger i have towards ""girls"" yesterday
matt thought i walked away cuz i was jealous or something but really i
wasnt the least bit jealous it just seemed like he was wrapped up in a
conversation so jake n i left the body jewelry stand....i mean we can
only stand there for so long.....so him and i ended up getting into it
at sears, i mean yea i feel totaly uncomfortable and the real reason is
as that i get hurt easily n theres nothing i can do about it right
now....i had a past stupid relationship where we broke up but still
hung up and one of the times we were hanging out he started making out
and cuddling with this other chick so i fear something like that
happening again, i mean i dont think matt would ever do that at least i
hope not but yea i mean this is someone i love n someone that can put a
smile on my face no matter how mad i may be....but i unno i just feel
uncomfortable around any of his friends that are girls cuz i dont wanna
see nething happen.....n this feeling came upon me on new years last
year a night i will never live down i just hope this year it will be
ALOT better....last year broke my heart n it was so hard to even look
at him, n now still almost one year later i still cant talk to the girl
that caused me such pain....<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"">so yea im just trying to overcome
certain things but its kinda hard but oh well i gotta do what i gotta
do, another thing i can never tell is when someone is trying to make a
situation better im blind in that respect n it sucks, cuz everytime he
tries i fall right through the situation and break the glass, im the
one that has to suffer the fact that he said he tried again and i
ruined that try....i love this guy more then anything i will never stop
i cant its impossible theres so many things hes done for me so many
precious moments and tons and tons of memories that only most dream
about, we have done more things then some married couples n we get to
do all the things so young n its so nice to be so lucky to make
memories n go places most cant go to....i value are relationship so
deep but its so difficult feeling like im on the other side of his
world, everything we do would be so much better if we were together if
he was a part of me again, n my mood was never like this when we were
together, it seems like im so unhappy n so sour all the time n i
realize that but to me its so hard cuz all i wanna do is hold him n
tell him my deepest truest feelings n how much i love him, but
everytime i think about it i hold myself back cuz i dont wanna express
myself n have him take it in a bad way or ""im coming on to strong"" i
wanna ease back into things but its so hard when u have so many strong
feelings for a person....and better yet a beautiful past....</span><br>

i dont think im the smartest person but i also dont think im that
stupid...so im about ready to get off so i check my myspace one more
time to see if leah ever got home n i see i have a stupid message its
from matt n i open it n it totaly doesnt sound like him and omg i
seriously think im loosing my head...im already not in that good of a
mood my mom is a raving bitch n i seriously hate feeling like im living
under the devils roof....i hate being here cuz it depresses me...no
doubt about it i love my mom but shit i dont know what to do
anymore....i feel like i dont belong anywhere....the happiest part of
my life ever is coming back on me like knives....i wanna be happy
again....no one knows what its like for me right now.....no one has the
best life n theres so many people i just wish i could be
like....especialy matt....i wish i had a ""real"" family but instead the
only family i have is his n there not real....he has a loving and very
strong mother...he has the most beautiful baby brother, n jake, n he
still has a fatherly figure that has been there for him....so many
things just hurt me to think about....his family is the closest thing i
have ever had to a family and now i just feel like an outkast
sometimes....not just to all of them but to the world....</span><br>
<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"">im a troubled person i know
that n im not scared to admitte to being troubled....but my whole life
i have been on my own...my mom was never home....i failed out on school
year after year cuz i didnt have people there to help me and guide me
through my eairly stages of life....i didnt always have the best of
everything....now money has turned itself into an object but really on
the inside that isnt me.....i grew up without so many things and now
that im able to have those things i tend to use it to my advantage but
then it gets old...like tonight i just wanted so bad to tell my mom to
shove the money up her ass cuz whenever she does really nice things for
me somehow some way it all comes back in my face and haunts
me.....haunts me so bad it hurts....</span><br style=""color: rgb(153, 255, 153);"">

understand my true feelings and what i really mean....i mean now i feel
like i fucked up again, i ordered something for matt that i thought was
really cute n now im wondering what if he doesnt like it....or what if
he reacts in a bad way??? how am i suppose to know....?....its one of
those things that i fell in love with and now im having second thoughts
about it in case he doesnt like it....now im scared about that....</span><br>
<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 204, 255);"">this is the worse part of my
life i mean just like i got done writting to one of my friends ""i never
know what ends up or what ends down"" im incomplete without the biggest
thing thats ever happened to me n thats matt, i mean i would die for
him i would do nething for him anything....n if i cant now i would find
a way and do it....i love him and sometimes it kills me inside to not
be able to hold him like i want to....alls i want is to make new
memories and start over from sqare one....i live each day on a prayer
and never ending faith....hes all i have in this world....the only
thing that makes me feel complete....n the only thing that keeps me
here....but most of the time i dont think he realizes what a huge
impact he is on me, n what would happen to me if he wasnt here for
me....just like i told his mom when i broke down at her work
outside....n matt if u read this please try and understand some of it i
know it probably doesnt make sence looking at it but yea....but i sat
there and told her how i feel like im drowning in regret...one thing i
did costed me everything n it was the stupidest thing but the biggest
wrong thing ive ever done....""i know i lied to u n i know its hard to
trust n so hard to forgive and i know theres no room for ever fogetting
cuz i know i never will as long as i live, im so sorry n i know i lied
n i honestly with all of my heart would never ever lie to you ever
again, theres no room to fear you cuz i found its nothing but an
intimidation but matt i love you and i wish you could see my true
feelings...""</span><br>

<span style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 153);"">growing up i never had true
friends, i never had anyone that ever looked out for me, i never had
anyone to look up to no one to tell me right from wrong, instead my mom
would beat me, my brother would tell me how stupid i was, my so called
friends where fakes, and my dad was never there, i suffered so much
emotional and physical pain and now its all coming back to me, so many
years i hid from everyone i acted like everything was ok and now
everything isnt ok....i was so happy two months ago, now im thinking to
myself how i can get back to that stage in my life, but i cant theres
only room to build a future and i just hope my future holds the biggest
part of my heart in it, i think he holds my whole heart, even if he
doesnt feel like accepting it right this second but i cant get it back,
hes the only one i could ever love.....<br>
<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 204, 255);"">i have a hero, i have a soul
mate, i have someone i can never stop loving, theres still alot of
things im missing in life and i hope someday i find whatever i havent
found yet....<br>

No one knows what it's like<br>
To be the bad man<br>
To be the sad man<br>
Behind blue eyes<br>
And no one knows<br>
What it's like to be hated<br>
To be fated to telling only lies<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
But my dreams they aren't as empty<br>
As my conscience seems to be<br>
I have hours, only lonely<br>
My love is vengeance<br>
That's never free<br>
<br>
No one knows what its like<br>
To feel these feelings<br>
Like i do, and i blame you!<br>
No one bites back as hard<br>
On their anger<br>
None of my pain and woe<br>
Can show through<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Discover l.i.m.p. say it [x4]<br>
No one knows what its like<br>
To be mistreated, to be defeated<br>
Behind blue eyes<br>
No one knows how to say<br>
That they're sorry and don't worry<br>
I'm not telling lies<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
No one knows what its like<br>
To be the bad man, to be the sad man<br>
Behind blue eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>

well im really board getting ready to go back up to matts....uhhh last
night i had a bunch of really shitty dreams i unno they where just
really weird and some i woke up to with tears coming down my face why i
dont even know? who the hell cries in there sleep? well i guess i
do....uhhh i unno im still at this confusing state of mind i dont think
anything with that will change sence im always in the dark no matter
how hard i tried....hmmm last night matt and i had dinner with the
grandparents it was pretty good...i was so cloose to taking them aside
and talking to them but i dont feel like crying infront of them or
giving my grandfather a heart attack....k well when everything first
happened i told my grandpa everything and for the first time in my life
i saw a tear fall from his face....couldnt stand that sight....i told
him everything and i cried and that made him cry,....for the first time
in my life ive found something that makes me happy and feel so strong
and im not gunna loose it forever....i just dont have the heart to tell
my 89 year old grandpa and hero that matt and i have been apart i just
cant do it,...my whole family loves him to death and im not about to
have them think twice and if i told my grandparents were apart i know
he would have another heart attack....theres to much at steak and i
just cant do it....alls i know is im gunna do this.,...hearing what my
grandma said last night im never going to be a bitch to him ever again
unless there is some damn good reason....he means far to much to me and
every morning and night its so hard i miss how it use to be but i cant
kiss him i know he wont go for it and im not going to....i always feel
like asking but no i dont wanna be so needy or whatever that would be
classified as....but this morning i wanted so bad to atleast kiss my
hand and put it on his forehead but no....didnt happen....im a chicken
and afraid of some sort of rejection....but im so set on a few tasks i
must conquor in order to even make it anywhere....and im pretty sure i
know where im gunna start.....</span><br>
<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">for the first time in my life i
felt like i was accepted and had a place....a thing i could call a
family unit something i have never really had before and when i did i
was so young and some memories i dont even wanna think about cuz it
hurts so bad...lets just say i had a hard ass child hood with no real
place....i always lived in fear of being alone and the fear of what
tomorrow would be like...theres things i miss so much but most of my
memories are bittersweet and so hard to think about without a million
tears and painful feelings tremble through my body....it was 2 years
ago i found a place and the cloosest thing to a family ive ever
had...matts family....matts mom made me feel like everything was ok but
for some reason i was always scared to talk to her or scared to go to
her for advice if i ever needed it but she was still always there for
me....things have changed from then tell now and i feel like things are
coming back together again....jake and nicholas mean so much....mommy
is my mommy and matt is someone i deeply love and a hero to me....but
there the only thing in life i try and live up to and its so hard
sometimes...i told jake that i feel like sometimes im not good enough
and i feel like everytime i get up i fall back down...and he said its
all in my hear that its not that way and he loves me but if only he
knew all my reasonings.....then i think to myself maybe im trying to
hard....but i dont know what that feels like honestly....im not a
people pleaser and i never will be cuz its just not me at all....but im
at the point where i want something so bad it kills but i dont wanna
pass up the opertunity of proving myself and who i am....my mind is set
on things i have to change and things im going to change and if it
kills me inside and out i will do it....atleast i would die pleased
that i changed the person i am to the person i need and want to be...in
other words the real me...<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">somethings about my childhood that
make it so hard for me to push myself and go after something i want
reflect alot on my past...well as far as never really having a family
unit my brother and i went for a few years without talking while he was
in highschool i guess u can say he was to cool for his own
sister....him and i never spoke to eachother not even hi and that
really hurt my feelings cuz alls i wanted was to be his friend and it
never happened....my mom worked full time and was never home...she was
an amazing provider no matter how hard times where she always made a
miracle happen....i wish i could have been clooser to her but it just
wasnt there.....i was raped when i was 11 by a 45 year old man which as
fucked up as it is my dad knew him and use to be friends with
him....well i was with my x best friend sheena and the man was her old
babysitter and she had to watch while it happened to me....i wasnt
about to see my friend who was weaker emotionaly and physicly have
something happen to her.....the cops called me a hero but to me it was
instinct to kick him in the nuts to escape him and run away if i hadent
have did what i did when i did it sheena and i wouldnt be here
today....he held us against our own will and demanded so many things or
else it was our life...he said if we ever told we would learn the hard
way....well here i am today living not to far from him its a scary
feeling but i think i have changed sence then and ive had no trouble
for a few years so things are going ok.....then there is the guy i have
no desire to call dad....he put my family and i through such
hell....hes nothing but a loosser a drug attick and cant even remember
my middle name....he did nothing to me but scar me for life....yes my
own godamn father let his friends molest me infront of him as he did
things to himself and watched porno and used a vibrater....his own
blood his own daughter tied up on my grandfathers bed....that night i
wished they would have just killed me...but they didnt....it was also
the last time i ever saw my own dad...i was 9 almost 10 but its been so
much better not having any contact with him....i never wanna see him
and never would he ever see me get married...he knows nothing about me
and i like it that way....but sometimes i wonder why i am still here
why i am still alive....i dont know....but those are only a few things
that stick out but im not writting this as a feel sorry for me thing
cuz as weird and fucked up as it sounds its in some ways made me so
much stronger but my past is full of painful memories....</span></span></span>"

breakdown infront of matt....couldnt help it it was something that just
happened....i learned that u cant burry ur emotions forever and u just
have to let them out of u no matter what the circumstance is....gloria
and i where just talking at the lake and thats what trigured my
emotions to come out....sometimes u just gotta go after what u
want.....its hard but i unno....so he pulled over and we talked well he
talked and i cried and wasnt sure if he could even understand what i
was saying cuz i was all emotional and yea.....i wish it was as easy to
talk to him and let it all come out like i can just let things come out
infront of my friends with no problem....maybe cuz its the feelings i
have for him and im afraid i unno....<br>
so today him and i had alil fight...well i unno if u call it a
fight....but i wrote my cousin who i never really get to see and she
told me we should go get r pics taken alone without matt....so what
could i do well i wanted to say no i did at first then she got all mad
so i said ok i guess it will be better if her and i go alone....he
didnt wanna be in them neways so i unno....so i messaged her back
saying maybe that would be better....then i brought up the word
""boyscoutting"" matt took it the wrong way and i didnt even know that
that word could even hurt someones feelings or make them feel bad....so
then i was all pissed off at myself for writting that word to my cousin
and then i write him a comment on myspace and im looking and there is
this girl named leah and she is saying how matt wants her and wants to
do her and all this bullshit and shes in his wallet and how she hearts
him....oh god i dont even wanna look at her profile cuz i dont know
what to think....i hurt his feelings and made him mad today and im
deeply sorry i didnt mean it the way he took it....but then i read that
comment....what is going on?<br>

feel so bad...ok well today i made a comment without thinking about
what i was gunna say it was just something that rolled out of my mouth
and it was a rasist comment i should have never said....well i offended
matt and i didnt even realize what i said tell he ripped into me about
it then i started thinking about what i said, how i ment it and how it
sounded when i said it....the truth is i am not raisist at all but the
way it came out it was raisist and i didnt mean it....i know to alot of
people this may be a stupid reason for feeling bad or whatever but
everyone is stereotypical some more then others but yes the way it came
out i sounded like a stereotypical bitch and i didnt mean to even say
it it just kinda came out....yea i have had some bad experiances with
people from different ethical backgrounds but matts right not everyone
is the same way....and i know that but god i unno why the hell i even
said what i said....errrrrrrrr oh well its done it was said and im
sorry....<br>
other then that my day could be alot better because of what i said i
feel like i ruined the day for everyone but uhhh i unno how to take it
back sence i cant....but still im sorry....<br>
i often dont think before i say something im one of those people that
thinks out loud without even thinking of what im gunna say it just
kinda comes out....<br>

""i dont know what the fuck a girl could see in a guy like you? how you treat your mother is the way you are going to treat your women"" i see something different in him, i see alot of things that most other guys have neve shown, i look past most of the bad things and look at all the positive things he has.....we all have bad qualities somewhere within us but i am not one that judges a person on there bad qualities. i give everyone a fair chance and i dont like what i see then its time to say ""good-bye"" hes someone i never wanna say good-bye too.....he means so much to me and best of all we really truely understand eachother inside and out......she told matt that ever sence i have been here her water and electric bills have sky rocketed...what the fuck is that shit.....matt told her that she takes more showers then us combined which is really true......and she drinks tea and boils water like 24/7......just cuz she herd what i was saying about how she is never alowed to use the tucks and im never gunna put gas in her car ever again doesnt mean she can blame me for her problems.....so many times i have wanted to step in and speak up for what i think......but NO i have bit my tounge each and every time......i want to save my breath and keep matt.....theres no way in hell i am going to let her ruin me and matt's relationship......he means more then anything to me.....and im not going to let her take that away from me.....i loved her like a mom but not anymore....im not going to stay there like i use to anymore.....ill stay once in awhile but not every night like i use to....and the only reason i will stay there overnight is for matt definately not for her.....i have helped her out so many times same with my own mother....if it wasnt for my mom helping her with her rent she more then likely wouldnt still be in that house....the only reason why my mom did it was cuz i told her i wanted matt to still beable to have a roof over his head and how much he really means to me, and that i couldnt stand to see him have to leave that house and posibly leave the area.... and she did she gave her her damn rent money and my mom still to this day has gone without a single ""THANK YOU"" for julianna.....my mom has taken matt under her wing like her own son which is so nice of her, theres not one thing she wouldnt do for matt.....hes more then just a person to me.....hes someone i have grown with and loved in more then one way......losing him would be losing myself......</FONT></STRONG>"

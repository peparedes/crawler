"event","It doesnt feel like i've gotten over you. But at the same time, i'm making myself believe i'm over you. Its difficult. Putting on a smile for everyone but deep inside, it hurts alot. Damn, i've been going through this situation alot. And i'm kinda getting used to it. HAHA, like deep inside you love her but on the outside, she doesnt mean a thing to you. HAHA, bullshit, but thats exactly what i'm trying to do. Which, i dont think is workling very well. I'm fucking weak and sensitive. Not to forget selfish. I can go and ge together with another girl, but i get all pissy and jealous when she talks about a guy. Or just some random guy. I try, try my best not to feel a thing but, i can never stop myself from feeling what i want to. I cant just stop myself from reacting to whatever i want to. Okay, it sounded better in my head. HAHA, i'm starting to sound like her. Awesome. Right. i can go on and on, and i dont wish too. I love myself, and i know we have something in common HAHA."

And well, i&rsquo;ve always wanted to ask you, Abigail Cera Jacqueline Anthony to be my girlfriend today. Like on this day. Its nothing special but its a very nice date and since i dont get you today, maybe i could wait for 11/11/2011 to come at exactly 11.11pm. HAHAHHA. You know, i dont mind waiting. Like seriously. I really love you. Like i&rsquo;m fucking in love with you. And everyone knows that very well. But you. You just dont see it like, you are not aware of how much you mean to me and how much i&rsquo;m dying to be with you. And you constantly hurt me. I dont understand you seriously. I still remember the first time we met. I was in the train, and my heart was beating faster than the drums and i had butterflies in my stomach, i actually went out of work, just like that to meet you. And you have no idea how nervous i was. But yea we met, and it was really awesome. Like we did get along well and like that was the first time i managed to look in your eyes and tell myself, i am in love with this girl. We were talking alot. Like really alot. And after we went to Poly to get MC, we went under a block, swear to god i dont know what block it is but, i really wanted to kiss you. I just dont have the guts when it comes to all this. Well, firstly, i dont have the guts and secondly, i dont know how to kiss. And thirdly, it was our first meeting, i dont wanna make a fool out of myself. And well, we kissed, well, you made the first move. And i swear to god i love it. I love every moment of it. Then we started meeting often. And till now, everytime i&rsquo;m on my way to meeting you, my heart beats faster than the drums and my stomach will be full of butterflies. And sometimes, i cant even speak. You see, you make me have unexplained feelings everytime it concerns you. Like everytime i think about you, i have this strong feeling in my heart, like seriously. Not the beating but a feeling that will make me smile to myself, like its so ticklish. And everytime i imagine your smile, without even realising, i&rsquo;ll be smiling too. Imagining how your lips will look like and how beautiful your teeths are. Bottom line, you have the most beautiful smile ever. And when i think about your eyes, i wish i could hold your face now, look into your eyes and just make out with you. Arggghhh fuck. Your lips are fucking soft. Like you&rsquo;ll never wanna stop. You&rsquo;ll just keep wanting more. But as i was saying, your eyes, they shine. Like its watery not cause you cry but its just the way it is not that watery just perfect&nbsp;and it really is beautiful. Your hair, its annoying sometimes when its a hot day and i see your hair covering your face, i get annoyed. But naturally, you look hot everytime your hair falls down and cover half your eyes. And i love putting it back neatly behind your ears. And looking in your eyes. Now, i wish i could hold you in my arms and give you a kiss on your forehead. And i&rsquo;ll tell you this, i dont just kiss anyone on their forehead. So, you mean alot to me. What can i say, you are just special. And i mean it. You&rsquo;re amazing, you&rsquo;re awesome, you&rsquo;re beautiful, gorgeous, hot, sweet, sexy, adorable, cute, annoying, noisy, talkative but, i love you alot. No matter what, i&rsquo;ll still love you. I really dont know how to explain to you how much you mean to me. But hey, not to forget, your smell. Gosh, i would love to hug you and not let go man. Seriously, i love you, and your smell. Its just so freaking nice. I love it laaaaa. Okay Rj burger is starting soon. As much as i wanna type more. I wont. HAHAH, its not like i&rsquo;m sending it to you HAH. I&rsquo;ll keep it to myself. For referrence (: Hey babylove, i love you very much. So much that i would sacrifice my life for you. I would never do anything to hurt you i love you so damn much Abby. I miss you.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">I feel so retarded now thanks to you. So here you go ))):</p><br />"

But somehow, whatever she said seem so true. Like the things she said for the rest who were there last night came true. And if mine were to be fake, its nonsense.

I just need to let it out.&nbsp;I miss you, i still love you.I still cant move on, i cant forget you. I need you so badly.<br /><br /><strong>Dear God, the only thing i ask of you is to hold her when i'm not around when i'm much too far away.</strong></p><br />"

So yea i came, and the class was used so i searched for him and he was asleep. So after 15 minutes, i came back and then he told me that class is cancelled. Like WTF? i came all the way to school for nothing. Stupid teacher, so yea. 

Met baby, and b. HAHAHA, Lina and Spade. Send lina to work after lunch then back to woodlands for soccer. Awesome shit. HAHHA. Really like it. So yea, reached home at around 8 and then Victoria was under my block. So talked awhile and i went home. I wanted to sleep awhile. I'm meeting her later so yea. So you should wait HAHHAHA.

Its really fucked up la actually. Everything/everyone keeps reminding me of her. I'm over her, i guess. Just dont push it. I can take it once in a while but all the time? Its been so long. So long since me and Annie have nothing to do with each other. So yes, we are friends, i guess. Just that.&nbsp;So stop asking me about her. It annoys the shit out of me. Not cause i hate her but i hate getting reminded of her. So please, thank you (:

So, went out with Victoria last night. HAHAHA, jose was there. And a few more friends. Surprisingly, we didnt drink. We played lots of games. Like stupid games i must say but yea, i had fun, and i feel young around you people. HAHAHHA. sorry, i just do. And thanks for making me feel better after an annoying, tiring day. Supper was delicious (: Swimming was insane. HAHHA, told you we'll get chased out. HAHHA. So yea, overall, you girls made my day (: Thank you.

Please give me the strength to go through it all over again."

Omg, Fel and Iman, if you guys are gonna read this. i cant believe i didnt ask for her number. Like seriously regret it. She look so damn innocent and she looks so adorable. And her eyes are brown. Hahaha. Thanks to Iman la, shop only! Herh ): Sigh, she's so adorable. Left without me ):

Thats been happening for like 3 days. So, i feel really dead. And the best part is, i have to be forced to eat. So annoying. Anyway, i'm really happy we can be friends. I know, you've been sacrificing too much for me, living a lie everyday, taking so much risk, so if i were to ask you to get back together with me, i'm being selfish. I know you want to cut all ties with me but we've been together for way too long and you are part of me. And when you suddenly vanish, i feel so lost. And the only thing i can do now is, be a friend. I'm glad, at least, you are still gonna be part of me. No matter what it is, i love you so much.<br /><br />So, Shahril's birthday chalet. Saturday to this afternoon. Reached there at 5 yesterday, set up all the things then started eating. The food are all home cook so yea. Then lots of people started coming. We were jamming in the evening. TIll like 7.30, cut cake. Swimming!!! Swimming was awesome. Like sometimes when i'm in thw swimming pool, i feel relief. Idky. Haha, so swimming till 10. Then people start leaving. Left with me, Stacey and Shahril, so we stayed up all night. We had our own gig till 2 then we go to the beach. Drank alot. And yea, i got drunk. Stacey and Shahril&nbsp;didnt drink much. So, they were taking care of me. Haha, the funniest part was, on thw way back to the chalet. A group of mat's were staring at Stacey. And since i was drunk, i swear at them like mad. And there was an arguement till this couple came. Damn funny. Okay, i'm going out for a drink. Will be back by 5. And by then i'll be going to school Awesome.<br /><br />i love you.</p>"

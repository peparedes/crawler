"event","okay yall......the human race in general is a hipocritical race correct....yes....i hate you all...well minus the FEW exceptional beings that i seem to enjoy....humans are liers cheaters and they backstab repeatedly.....within every human is a lifetimes abundance of false promises and most of us choose to flood everyone else in there state of shallowness by dishing out nuthin but lies and hallow promises........if it wasnt for this music and this poetry i have then i honestly dont know how i would deal with all of you bastards...and its weird cause its the ones that agree with you and the ones that back you and the ones that show so much potential for caring that are the ones to hurt you the most....trust in my eyes is dead...the act of good will has been extinguished long ago.......well with that being said heres some poetry.............................................

encased inside this brick building
the mortor molds to freeze the seams
the lights look down upon me
sheading hope on the shadows inside me

in the corner of doubt
it brings on all uncertainty
always nice to know your downward spirals
encased witin victory

tap it out, these feelings held within
taken from me, my inspiration
you've gone too far, as to conjourn up these lies
its great to know that these hollow gestures are representing my life

read between the lines or my eyes
this time my lips are sealed
recognition due to you its true
that your dead to me.

i feel torn up inside my parting words.
truely, deeply, madly in love was
the debt to make me turn

away in shame comeback to me
you were the only thing
that made me ....me"

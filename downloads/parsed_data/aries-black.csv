Today's topic. How Comcast kind of sucks as a internet provider. Ever since the power went out for days in the beginning of July, my net has been acting up. Random disconnects, page freezing etc. Also it seems like my laptop is most likely dying too, and when that happens I will be a sad sad panda.. 

On some better news, my guy is awesome sauce. <3"

"event","<i>This story takes place on the world of Aion. It's a tragic love story that will most likely end in heart break. I'm half debating on changing the names to protect peoples privacy but on the same hand who really cares? It's not like anyone will read this, recognize the people and tell them that they're in my story. But oh well, we'll see how it goes. Now this is true. Every last word I write is the absolute truth. So lets begin...</i>

Four months ago I had returned to Aion looking for a distraction after the horrible relationship I've had with Zach. The game had changed, lot of new goodies so I started working on my Chanter and my Spiritmaster. I reconnected with old friends, made new friends and joined a decent legion where people were nice and helpful. I had vowed not to get involved in another relationship, thinking I needed to recover. I avoided the flirty guys, and stuck close to doing things by myself. Till he came back into my small Aion world. 

He and I had first met roughly around July 14 when my server Ariel was merged with Siel. I had joined a Dredgion group and he said 'Hi' to me. I ignored him because at that time I had a boyfriend and despite how I am I was trying to be good. I had decided to fly around the Abyss on my Chanter and I had gotten killed by an Asmo and he had flown out to raise me even though I said I was just going to release. It turned into Asmo hunting till Dredge popped and we went in. We had talked via whispers through out the run and afterwards when I made my way to Taloc's Hallow to farm and grind.

From there we had started a tentative friendship with a small bit of flirting. Every time I'd log on he'd send me heart emotes and ""ily's' and he'd tell me to get in his van in the global channel after I'd say something in there. We'd butt heads about some people and how he treated one of my best friends. I eventually discovered that he had a girlfriend, and things changed between us, I still had my rule of not flirting with guys that had girlfriends. So I withdrew slowly. And I had decided to quit Aion because of more drama and I think it was around the time I had started dating Zach. And we had stopped talking completely.

Now we move to four months ago on my return to Aion...He was still with that chick and I was single it started the same way as it did before. He was always so happy to see me, the hearts and the 'ily's came and went. And while I tried not to feel anything for him he made me happy. Then it happened...He was single...it started off innocently enough. We had traded phone numbers and would text each other constantly when I was at work. He was my smile in the morning and the last thought I had before I fell asleep and I was sinking fast. If I had known...that how things would have turned out...I don't know....would I have done the same thing...?

One day...I finally told him that I liked him a lot. And I meant liked him liked him. He confessed he felt the same and we were finally together. It was a wonderful feeling. Having someone there for me, I was on cloud 9. Little did I know...that it would have crashed and burned with in the first week of us becoming official. It started with little things, the little white lies we tell people...His were that he lived in Japan, he was a orphan with a horrible past. This is the part where I'm not going to say what he had told me because it might be true, it might not who knows... Anyway I digressed, while talking to him on skype he introduced me to someone he claimed was his brother. Which later turned out to be his best friend of over 10 years give or take. Now his friend confessed that he really lives in Texas. Now that made me curious, why lie about where you live? When I confronted him about it, he brought up something different entirely ""If its about Sarah, there is nothing going on she's just a friend and she's 16."" Now that that should have been a big red flag that I paid attention too. But I stored it in the back of my mind. 

Flash forward to a week later from that conversation, I had a long shift at work and usually he would have texted me by my break and he hadn't yet. And it made me a little nervous and paranoid especially after the whole ""Sarah"" thing. I text some friends, and I find out that he had already been logged into Aion for a while now. And hanging out with ding ding ding ""Sarah"". It wasn't all that hard to figure out who she was in the game. And after talking to him about it, and him stonewalling me that I finally confronted her. To find out that...She is his girlfriend, and has been his girlfriend for a while now. Shocking huh? Now the twisted part...even more twisted...Despite that, I stayed with him...I didn't tell her the truth and just pretended shock and surprise. She to this day still doesn't know about me, or so I think.

The past four months have been...amazing...and yet not so amazing. A roller coaster would best describe it. Or as my best friend says ""I've never seen you so happy and yet so miserable as you are with him."" Which described the relationship perfectly. After a few weeks, Sarah had disappeared from Aion, he got sent to the hospital due to some major/minor injuries and from my understanding he had told her that he was in the hospital recovering. Lies on top of lies....Now that bit bout being in the hospital recovering ended last month right before my birthday. And I had caught him in a lie. And from that day, things have gone downhill pretty fast. I had caught him on vent with Sarah, after he had mysteriously gone afk and muted his mic on skype. Then there would be a period of where he'd get defensive and lie to me. And a period where things seem fine and perfect between us. Every two or three weeks I'd catch him on vent with her and we'd be back to fighting. Now I've told him countless times that lying to me won't do him any good because I always find out the truth. 

And well...one day after catching him on vent I had a heart to heart talk with his best friend which apparently he which he had apparently listened to and had made comments to his friend about everything I said. Most notable was where he compared me to his girlfriend. Mainly how he prefers her over me, because she's a 'sexier virgin'. Ouch huh? Now his friend had shown me the full conversation a few days after that incident and I've pretended not to know about it for a while. I was angry on so many levels and I still am angry. It made me wonder, if he preferred her so much why was he with me? And I still want to know why. It is probably something I'll never know.

Now lately I've caught him flirting majorly with a bunch of other girls on Aion. He'd try to be subtle about it but I always find out in the end. Now with everything else, its just adding on to my already battered heart. And I wonder how much longer can I stay by the person I love when he acts like this, and he treats me like this. 

The story isn't over yet...since we've finally caught up to the present. There are some parts I had removed due to personal and keeping some people safe. And I guess the only name that was exposed was his girlfriends. It's not that hard to figure out who he is. His character and my character have screen shots on a older post. 

Who knows, this story might end soon. Wish me luck..."

Let's seeee....Been doing not a lot to be honest. Udas barely puts out, did Besh once got nothing useful lol. Been trying to do some instances but the timing is usually off on my case. Work sucks, Sammie's been sick and my love life is still er...

The Elyos on Siel have been trying to cap a Asmo fort for the past two nights. We've had little success the PvP is pretty fun when you have a bad ass partner to watch your back. Love you Raiikiri with all my itty bitty heart."

"event","After reactivating my account I decided to; instead of going back to ElectricMayhem I decided to apply to Immortality instead. Better people, and not as stress inducing as being a sack in EM. The event times are different, more varied and the people are generally more to my caliber of my twisted sort of humor. I don't have to watch my tongue that often and worry about offending people for picking on them. The members are all easy going and I get along with them very well. 

I'll still be playing Aion but with the time crunch and how long it takes to do things I'll probably stick to grinding to 50 and making fort events when I can. The only days Immortality doesn't have events are the days I am in school for my night classes. Which works out for me, Unlike with Aion majority of our events happen on nights that I am in class and can't make it. 

Apparently both games are going through a few major changes. With FFXI, they're doing a lot of work...Server Mergers, increasing the level cap to 99, adding 3 more add-on missions and new areas. Aion is increasing the level cap to 55, adding ground abyss new armor etc. I'm looking forward to the changes in both games and maybe I'll be able to pick one that I can stick with."

"event","I'm reactivating my FFXI account in a few days. While I'll still be staying in EM, I probably won't be doing events. I'll mainly be focusing on leveling my alts or farming. And before anyone asks, no I'm not bored with Aion. Aion just requires more time then I'm able to give it. There are a few instances I'm not able to do because of time constraints. I'm only level 44 as my highest and around that level range there is only a limited things to do. Steel rake, which can take upwards to 6 hours for a decent clear, Fort instances, grinding/farming among other things. Grinding can get extremely boring, since I'm used to group dynamics of the party sense like FFXI is. So gaining levels in this game takes more time then hitting a 75 job. 

And another major stumbling block is the prices of stigmas I need haven't gone down or increased on the broker. IE Recovery Spell is so rare, that when it is up people try selling it for 25m to 30m. Money in this game even with two crafts maxed is still hard to make. Food doesn't sell very well and while pots and potions sell good, the market is easily flooded. 

Grinding is one way to make money but it is so boring. And being able to see how much exp you need to the next level is kinda like. ""OMG fuck this."" kinda thing. I'll still be playing Aion for fort raids and what not. But other then that we'll have to see."

"event","She curled up tighter while pulling her hood over her light pink hair. The image burned into her mind as the spasms shook her slender body. 

""Kym...? Kymira? Are you okay?"" Anax asked as he carefully walked towards her.

""He did it again."" Kymira asked in a choked whisper.

""He did what again?"" Anax asked as he gingerly sat on the floor next to her.

""I saw them...together....he..he had his arms around her...."" She choked out as another sob tore out of her chest. 

""Saw who?...Kym? Who did you see?"" He asked her slightly annoyed. 

""Sankou and Lysithea....they...they were kissing..."" She mumbled as she turned over and stared at Anax with tear streaked face. 

Anax stilled and stared at Kymira grasping for words. He had saw small hints of the affair and was surprised Kymira had never noticed. But then again, she has always been oblivous to things around her. 

""So...you knew and you didn't tell me."" She said softly as her brown eyes widen in shock. 


""YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?!"" She screamed out as her small fist struck his plate armor. 

He grabbed her hand and smiled a little as she winced and lightly rubbed her knuckles. 

""Yeah...I knew...I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to see you...well like this..."" He tried to shift away from her a little bit since her body radiated heat.

She bit her lip and stared blankly at the wall while lightly rubbing her knuckles. 

""I was on my way to see him....to bring him some Aether Jelly since he loved the stuff...And I heard her, telling..telling him that she loved him....and that she wanted to be with him...And she reached up, pulled his head down and kissed him."" she paused and took a gulp of air. 

""I should have known, all the times they've been hanging out? Doing things with out me and excluding me from things...He kept telling me he loved me and behind my back he and my best friend are trying to hook up? And her...she was my best friend...all this time, after everything I've done to her....She she stabs me in the back.""

She let out a soft groan as her body spasmed again and again sending tears to her eyes.

""Wha...what is happening to me? I...I feel weird..."" She groaned out as she fell over onto the floor and continued to spasm. 

""You..you're glowing..."" He said as he took a step back and watched in amazement. 

""HE CHEATED ON ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN?! WITH MY OWN BEST FRIEND?!"" She screamed out as the light emiting from her glowed brighter.

""I gave him my heart, my body everything I had I shared with him. And he goes behind my back and fucks my best friend!? He swore to me, nothing happened between them after the first time...The first time?!  This would be the what? second? third time?"" She threw her head back and laughed.


""Kym...are you okay?"" Anax reached out a hand to her only to have her smack it away. 

""I wonder how many people knew, and what they thought. 'There goes poor little Kym...did you know her best friend is fucking her boyfriend behind her back? The poor dear must be blind to what everyone can see...' as Kym tried to stand up and point to herself. ""The countless nights he never came home till early in the morning? And how she refused to let me set her up with someone? This was the reason?!""

""Kym..relax...calm down...please..."" Anax whispered as he slowly tried to wrap his arms around her. 

The light glowed brighter around her as she slowly levitated into the air.

""You've been chosen Kymira...Embrace your anger...embrace your pain and ascend into the light..."" 

Anax watched, transfixed as light emited from Kymira's eyes and mouth and as the voices swirled louder around her. 

""You will soon follow...you will be her shield and protect her...protect her from herself...from her pain...And you will be rewarded..."" The voice lightly whispered into his ear as a cold invisible hand lightly brushed his cheek. 

White feathers danced around Kymira's body as she bent forward as two white wings sprouted from her back and gently wrapped around her slender form. As the light slowly began to fade, Kymira lightly landed on her feet looking at Anax in amazement.

""I...I have wings?"" She whispered."

I got my Sorcerer to 31 over the weekend, been spamming Fire Temple which is a instance for levels 30 and up. I'm still kind of in the low end for Fire Temple but not having that many complaints. I'm slowly working on my other characters and hoping to get em all close to 30 soon...Well not soon since it takes a long time and I get distracted easy. xP 

All in all I'm having fun in AION."

Name: Kymira
Job: Sorcerer
Level: 27
Server: Ariel

Note: Between the levels of 25 to 28(29) AION has an instance called The Nochsana Training Camp. This place is pretty good exp wise, drop wise and money wise. But once you're in and beat everything and exit, you will not be allowed to enter for 18 hours. So what I've been doing is waiting till I'm able to sit down and focus on it before logging into Kymira. Because at level 20, the game activates Rest EXP which is, the longer you've been offline, you will get a EXP bonus when you log on which dwindles down when you kill mobs. I've decided to rack up as much rest exp as I can so when I log on for Nochsana Training Camp, I'll be getting extra EXP. At level 30, I get my new wings and access to other instances. All in all, I'm enjoying Sorcerer.

Name: Erised
Job: Gladiator 
Level: 12
Server: Ariel

Note: AION doesn't allow names based of Mythology, well the main characters that are prominent in Mythology. She was originally suppose to be named Eris based off the Greek Goddess Eris of Discord. I'm actually enjoying a melee job in this game. I can fight 4-5 mobs before I need to rest. She's on the same server as Kymira, so when I'm looking for a Training Camp group I'll be on Erised and when I see one looking for a Sorc I switch characters. Or when I'm building up rest exp I'll be on Erised slowly working on her.

Name: Kymira (Orignal no?)
Job: Spirit Master
Level 14
Server: Triniel (Asmodian)

Note: Apparently you're not allowed to make two different races on the server. So I decided to make her on Triniel since I had a few friends that were also Asmodian on Trin. Spirit Master is akin to Summoner in FFXI but a million times better. For one, having your Spirit out won't cost you any MP. You only get four elements I think. Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth. I do believe there is a 5th one but I'm only level 14 so I'm not to sure about it. So far I'm enjoying Spirit Master as much as I enjoy my other two jobs. The Asmodian side is also pretty interesting in the beginning areas. When I'm waiting on Training Camp timer, I'm more then likely leveling up my Spirit Master or my Glad.


That's a quick run down on my 3 characters in AION. If you see me around feel free to say hi."

As for RL stuff, Sammie and I got hit again with another case of the cold/fever. But as usual she's still bouncing around like a bunny on crack while all I want to do is curl up in my bed and watch TV while drinking a cup of hot tea. 

Anyway don't really have much to update about lol. Maybe later."

"event","Don't really feel like posting FFXI screenshots from last week. Soo I'll just give a quick run down. On Monday we did a 4 zone Limbus which went pretty good. Considering Snax and I weren't informed of the plan, also considering Snax and I are in charge of Limbus. My group handled the Kings Zone and manaburned it. I decided to go BRD since my BLM buffer was suffering really badly. All in all we got the win for all 4 zones which means we have Omega tonight. 

Tuesday night we split up into two groups to do Bv1 and Ouryu for the people that had orbs/needed access to Bv2. Oddly enough, I switched to RDM for Ouryu and no one complained about how my poor little Novio Earring wallowing in my inventory being put to waste. We did two Orbs and both had decent drops but meh. xP I was on refresh and elementals duty not that bad and it did keep me pretty busy.

Wednesday we went back to Dynamis Xarc after doing a round of CoP zones. And instead of clearing the NM's to do Dynamis Lord, we just went for farming mobs. We did net a decent amount of AF and currency but not thay many note worthy things. It makes me sad that my RDM is still sitting at 5/6 AF wise but can't really be helped. At least the one hat that dropped for the LS has stayed in the LS. The upside is that this Wednesday we might do Dyna-Beac which Linaa needs to access Xarc. I'm pretty willing to go BRD and baby sit BLMs just for the win. Which  brings me so much closer to getting THF relic hands for Linaa's THF.

Thursday is our usual Einherjar night and it was a Tier 3 zone. Unfortunately we lost the zone, we just had the worse draws as usual we ended up with Flayers and Eyes on the first wave and then Taurus for the second. And as for the boss? We ended up with the Vampyre one that after a certain amount of damage splits up into different mobs and spreads out. Thuuus we ran out of time. 

My LS is also complimenting a few changes to our event roster. Mainly doubling up Einherjar and Limbus so they go twice a week instead of once a week. I'm on the shelf on this, since our attendance seems to peak during Einherjar and suffer during none boss Limbus runs. Basically, since Einherjar only takes half an hour we will head to Jueno ASAP to get Soap and head to the respective zones. And the plan is to have people change jobs fast. But I doubt some of the members being able to pull this off with out to much drama/problems. 


Now for AION!

I decided to make a Asmodin on Triniel to see that side of the story, and man...I'm loving it. I love this game and the mini stories for each quest is pretty good. The graphics, the customization is out of this world.

I named both my characters Kymira, one is a Sorcerer and the other is a Spirit Master. My Sorcerer is currently at level 17 while my Spirit Master is at 12. They're both Mage jobs which is pretty good since I'm drawn to magic. xP Anyways back to AION for me. Maybe I'll see some of my readers there~"

<i>Don't cry for me, how easy love has gone.
Try to see, how deep my despair is
Come winds of fate and time, take my tearful memories.

Call out to thee, sing your name in sweet harmony
but only the echoes fade away.
Crying breeze to thee every moment with chiming wind
where has the silent tears gone.

Don't sigh for me, your fate rings false to me,
try to see the shards of history.
Darkness fills my heart and I'm laughing loud on all that's passed us by.

Call out to the, sing your name in sweet harmony
the wind blows endlessly.

Roaming around whirly world, rough breath in dark, cruel blades and tears in sorrowful days.
Burning away hollow hopes, wrong pray for God where have the angels gone?
so I need to weep myself out gently, blindly.

Please come to me, come dusk, the past will flee,
try to see the new dawn what brings hope faintly.</i>

Tuesday was Ouryu that we've been putting off since Thunder got hacked. I had originally intented to go BRD since I went and had a Crumhorn +2 made. But Erised started going emo because my Novio Earring was being put to waste sitting in storage. Which I kinda found ironic since they've been trying to keep me off my BLM for a while because people complained that I kept dying to much during some events when I'm on BLM. I don't see why it is any of their problem that I die a lot, its MY EXP.

Lately, we've been trying to figure out what Dynamis Zone we're doing since Erised never posts it or updates the calender. We pretty much see where he AFK's and wait to see if he see's his shadow on a full moon. And if he see's his shadow we end up doing Valk 6 more times. But finally we won Valk so I'm hoping we don't end up going back.

Now for the past couple of weeks, I've been trying to get Dynamis Windy win on Linaa. And a Dyna LS called FundMyRelic was willing to let me tag along for the win. But the run went horribly wrong. Someone had aggroed the Deathhouse and the group got split in two. We didn't get the win which kinda sucked but Ratix said they're redoing Dyna Windy on Tuesday. And said I'm more then welcome to join em. So I'm going to go with them on Tuesday night.


That's it for my update thingy. xP"

"event","I was walking to Sammie's Pre-school yesterday to pick her up and I walked past Wendy's Drive thru and this black car pretty much tried to ran me over and into the busy street. I wasn't able to get a license plate number, or a good look at the driver. I wasn't hurt at all since I was able to kinda jump out of the way a little bit, the only thing that I hurt was my elbow from falling on his car while he tried to push me into the street.

I know it was either a black BMW or a Mercedes, with really dark tinted windows. I know it was a guy because I saw a white long sleeve and the outline of a guy's head. I know I can't really do anything since I didn't get a license plate number. =\ But damn I'm still pretty shaken up by the whole thing. ><


Also Tai and I broke up. We barely talked as much as we used too and I couldn't get over the fact that he would remain friends with someone that actively tried to break us up. With everything I was going through, he wasn't willing to stop talking to her to make things a little bit easier on me. And that made me suspect that there was something going on between them. And things like that do not add up for a healthy relationship. It's kind of ironic, today would have been our 2 year anniversary.

Tuesday we did outside Jailers and I busted out my BLM after having it put away for a bit. It's kinda funny, someone complained to Fur that I wasn't nuking with my partner and resulted in him dying...When uhm...I was the one solo nuking JoJ's babies for a short period of time while the RDM in my party just sat there and let me die. But eh it was fun taking on Jailers again. And from the looks of things we're due for another few rounds of JoL which means I bust out my RDM tanking set. Yeah, I know I retired it, but with fail leaving months ago and Erised selling his RDM tanking set, that leaves Snax to RDM tank. So I figured I'd help him out.

Wednesday was Dynamis Valk but since we didn't have enough people show up that night we hit up Dynamis Tav. I perked up at the thought of Duelist Chap finally dropping but yeah, guess the game still isn't ready to give me my hearts one desire. xP

Me, my brother and Sammiekins~

Thursday night we had Einherjar Tier 3 again. Annnnnd this time we won! So yeah we have Odin this week. And I'm looking forward to it. The last time we did it, we did it with 19 people which is a pretty good deal. It was a busy run so I wasn't able to get any screen shots. I won't be able to bring Linaa to Odin since she needs a Tier 2 win. But she can be a feather mule for the next one. 

Over the weekend though, Sammie and I both caught a cold but she's still running around playing etc while I just want to curl up in my bed and sleep. It got a bit worse for her since my mother took us to Disney on Ice on Saturday. It was pretty good and we got a video but not much pictures. Sammie enjoyed it a lot and I'm glad. 

Saturday I was suppose to do Dynamis Windy with FMR to get clearance on Linaa but they had a zone change because Windy was already taken and there was another group waiting to go in. So I just did Nyzul with my SP and after a few rough starts, we've finally gotten to floor 30. We're not having too much luck with the floor draws but we're making progress and that makes me happy. I'll eventually have floor 100 on both Linaa and Green and it'll make it so much easier getting the WS's for the respective weapons. 

Annnnd my last paragraph for tonight~ Swift belt run in like 2 hours or so. I'm hoping I go 1/1 again like last time. Annnnyways, gonna end this entry now. Much love to you all~

Not my proudest moment but I was sick as a dog and spent majority of the night cuddling the toilet. I spent the majority of the night following Snax and just afk ballading which was bad but eh. Kinda hard to focus on the game when you're sick.

Win~

I'm sleepy so not really gonna add much of anything xP. Only thing I gotta say is that it seems a few more people have complaints that I have Linaa which has BRD and THF leveled to 75. And that while I play both jobs just fine, some people are complaining that I never leveled those jobs. *shrug* I don't see much of a problem with it since I actually know what I'm doing and have geared them both up accordingly. And I ask people on things I don't understand about both jobs. I have very good friends and willing teachers to answer any questions I have on those two jobs. 

I do get easily annoyed when I'm asked to show up on RDM and end up getting tossed in the BLM party as a refresh whore. To me its the bottom of the tier and feels like a punishment. And if that is the case, I've always been designated as the BLM refresh whore. I've never seen the other RDM's in the LS having to do the refresh whoring more then I have. So it does seem kinda unfair. On BRD it is pretty much the same thing since you're just casting ballad x2 and elegy. And stand there.....and stand there....etc. Snax told me I should help cure a little or toss a random erase now and then when I'm /WHM so I'll probably try that. Meriting wise, I enjoy BRD more then RDM since I get to pull and stuff which is fun. =3

As for my THF, I only need a Thunder Ring and a Antares Harness to finish up gear wise. And I want to work on Dagger and Crit merits for THF. And Lullaby recast with maybe Madrigal recast. I'm looking forword to getting em both done merit wise since I can bring Green along and get her merits too while having Snax play her RDM. Sooo its two birds for the price of one. =3"

My girls~

<h1>Now for the weekly recap~</h1>
<h1>Limbus // Monday</h1>
I decided to take Linaa to Limbus to see how I handle events on BRD. It wasn't that hard surprisingly. Wasn't able to take any screen shots since I was doing a lot of running around.

<h1>ZNM's // Tuesday</h1>
We had Tinnin to end our ZNM time. I went on Linaa again because we needed BRD/BLM's for Elemental Seal Elegy.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/0006zt23/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/0006zt23/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""213"" border='0'/></a>

It was a lot harder, since Tinnin does a AoE attack that hit me a lot when I'd run in to Marchx2 the PLD's. Drops were bleh but meh. The fights were all sloppy till the third fight where someone would give a warning when Tinnin would do Bulwark. But it was still a fun fight for BRD.

<h1>Dynamis // Wednesday</h1>
Annnnd back to Xarc, god I hate this zone it puts out like a Sunday school nun. I couldn't take Linaa because Linaa needed 1 more city win and needed Glacier win. I wouldn't have brought her either way because Xarc still needs to drop my Duelist Chap. Yeah no pictures was to tired the majority of the run. And I ended up falling asleep towards the end of the run. And no Duelist Chap dropped. ~le sigh~


<h1>Einherjar // Thursday</h1>
We did a Tier 1 Einherjar to get more people clearance so we have a decent amount of bodies for Odin. My Linaa was needed again because we were down 1 bard. All in all, it is pretty damn fun. I can see where some people would get tired of having to go bard all the time but for me, I've always gone RDM or BLM to all events so being on BRD was something different.

All in all things in the LS have settled down, except we seem to be losing WHM's left and right. One ditched events all week to hang out with his ""GF"" and the other is getting bogged down with RL stuff. So I'm going to start leveling my WHM up a bit more. It's currently sitting at 50 I just need to get SCH to 37 before I can make a push to 75. But I'm not sure I'll be able to fill the role since I already have RDM and BLM and both are needed most of the time. But it is well worth a shot. I'm planning on meriting like crazy on Linaa and having Snax logged into Green for needed merits. I have a lot of work to do~

Also something funny that happened yesterday...

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/00074cy6/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/00074cy6/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""213"" border='0'/></a>
No I didn't go to the website. I'm pretty damn sure it is one of those Phishing sites. The funny thing is that she was the only one in the LS to get the tell. But yeah it was pretty funny nonetheless. </center>"

"event","<center>Well a continuation from something I posted at the beginning of the month ""Anyways, drama is slowly ending so I'm just gonna sit back and keep my mouth shut. I don't want it to explode again and cause me more problems. Short story, someone left the LS didn't go out gracefully and brought up things I've posted in the past here in my own blog saying they were recent and that I was harassing them. Turns out it wasn't me because you know, I have to be logged in to actually do any harassing. Plus my most recent mention of the said person was back in April. Now someone is claiming that it was someone else etc etc you get the idea. So for now, I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut.""

Well anyway, it did die down for a good two weeks and things proceeded as normal for events. Then the persons boyfriend decided to leave the LS too because nothing was done about the harassment which was I was proven innocent of. The BF was a decent guy so him saying all that was kind of random considering it was already proven that I had nothing to do with the whole situation. I feel kinda bad that he had to leave too but oh well. I start to wonder if it was worth it when nothing changed. *shrug*

Thing brings me to something kinda important. If you are being harassed by someone in your LS, the smart thing to do is take a screen shot and send it to a person in charge. A lot of things will change if you have actual proof of the harassment. Journal posts(my journal posts about her were far and few.) while some are made public and people will read it does not count for harassment because it is a matter of opinion by the writer. 

Now if it was posted on public boards that are accessed by thousands of people then sure it can be considered harassment. Because a lot of LS's look down members or other people making the LS look bad. And if you are going to lie about the said harassment, make a more convincing story and for the love of all that is holy, don't constantly change what happened because it will look so fake and that you are just trying to cover up the real reason why you are leaving.

If that reason really was just that I don't like the person, I don't know what to say. In this life you can't expect everyone to like you.  I left them alone as best as I could, and really, what more can you ask?  I guess from what was said some people felt that asking that showing up to our events had some kind of noticeable effect on the rewards you get from our events.  It wasn't supposed to be a personal attack, but if you ask me, saying that kind of thing is a personal attack just sets yourself up. 

The thing is, I don't like a lot of people. But I'm not going to go out of my way to harass them. There are more important things to do then sit around harassing someone on a ""weekly"" basis as I was accused of. I also made a point at being nice to everyone even if I didn't like them. Now I've been asked before, why stay in a LS where you don't really like that many people? My answer is that, while yes, I may not like a lot of people I'm not going to refuse to work with them in any way. And my friends that I do have in the LS out weighs my dislike of some of the people. Yes, I put my friends higher then the people I don't like. My friends and the things we as a collective whole in the LS accomplished makes up for everything.

Right now, I'm glad that the drama is over. And things in the LS can go back to the way it was before all of this started. I'm looking forward to more success that we have accomplished. And surprisingly I'm getting along with a few people that I haven't before. 

And for those that might get pissed about this long collective post I have something just for you.

Yes people, I was DNC to Omega. It was a fun fight on DNC I spent the majority of the time spamming steps and helping cure a little bit. But honestly, I didn't like it as much. I felt kinda bad going DNC when I could have gone RDM or BLM. But eh it wasn't that bad.

Tyger is a pain in if you're not watching his moves carefully. At around 50% HP he starts using Fulmination which is a strong Paralyze and can be the death of the alliance. The first one was a little bit sloppy when Fulm got past the stuns. ^^; (lol oppps)

Riko himself is really squishy. Normal Tier 4 nukes would do upwards to 4k well for me that is since baby's got a Novio~ But what makes him hard is at around 50% he summons henchies and then Riko becomes immune to damage and gets healed to 100% by two WHM henchies. He does that 3 times. The idea is, when he summons the henchies, we have to kill them. Fast. At the third round he summons, you can take him down easily. It took us about 4/5? Times to beat him. 

Extra goodies I got...

One of my LS mates got this from Tyger and he decided to sell it. Annd I bought it for a Peacock Charm. What? I'm a girl I make weird decisions. It's cute! Don't look at me like that. ; ;

Reward for the A Moogle Kupo d'Etat Missions since I don't have BLM Relic Hat this would serve for the time being. I love it so far and it so gosh darn cute.

Major E-Peen item. With the rest of my gear, I'm pretty damn awesome as a BLM now. The only thing I need is a Morg's body but eh. That would take to much time and effort to get plus it costs a lot  to upgrade. Well I still need BLM relic legs but Dynamis doesn't put out as much as we  want. 

All in all it has been an awesome start to the week. Hopefully Dynamis and Einherjar goes pretty good."

Anything noteworthy that dropped was the Haidate that costs 25m give or  take on server which dropped to my friend Mits. 

<h1>Wednesday</h1> we got lucky and got Dynamis Xarc as the zone but drop wise was craptasticular. WAR, BRD, DNC and something else. Didn't take that many SS's of Dyna since they all look pretty much the same.

Yeah I got DNC body so I'm happy bout that but was hopin for at least Duelist Chap. Knowing my LS's luck we're not going to see another one drop for a long time. We only ever got 2, one went to Sae and one went to someone who left shortly after getting it.

<h1>Thursday</h1> Einherjar Wing I as usual only money items dropped and no abj's which kinda sucked. And didn't take any SS's last night since I was kinda upset that I didn't get to go DNC. But I did get a

So I'm really looking forward to that. I'm always RDM or BLM for the big fights like Omega and Ultima. 

With my DNC gear, I'm slowly trying to make more improvements to it. With the help of Meia the other DNC in the LS, she gave me a list of the must have gear things for everything DNC related so I'm gonna be pretty busy. Most of it is R/EX that I should get at some point so it isn't a big deal. For big ticket I have to buy items I need a Black Tathlum which is 7m, a Cuch Belt which is roughly around 2m and a few other pieces. I'm debating if I want to fully upgrade my DNC since I rarely use it. I'm still pushing forward with leveling WHM but also trying to work on the Moogle expansion quests. Right now my WHM is at 48 so I can push for at least 2 more levels as WHM/BLM then get my AF then work on SCH to 37 to finish up WHM to 75. After that is taken care of I'll go back to leveling SMN up or my other melee subs I need for DNC. 

All in all the week turned out alright. >.o"

<h1>Tuesday</h1> we did Dynamis Tav and failed miserably. We wiped so many times it was not funny. And no one was at fault except for that stupid worm popping up in the least expected place and caused us to wipe. We attempted to recover but pulls went horribly so we ended up losing the zone.

<h1>Thursday</h1> ODIN FTW! With 19 people too which is pretty epic considering people kept saying we would NEVER be able to beat it. While yes, I was uncomfortable with that low of attendance we still managed to pull through.

Drops were pretty good. P. Body, H. Body and W. Head. So Odin did put out a little.

Two legs and a body. The last time we saw legs was a year or so ago. Same goes for the body which is pretty awesome.

Slowly coming back to FFXI after my break. I'm still debating if I want to come back full time or just take it slow. The LS lost a WHM so I'm debating on leveling WHM instead of SMN. But that requires me having to log on and level. xP I'm enjoying Monster Hunter a lot and have gotten over 150 hours in it. If anyone plays it'd be cool to do some quests with. I'm currently HR7 with full Narga X armor. =3

This is one of my other armor sets. Yes I know its pretty. Some of the armor in Monster Hunter look pretty good. 


Anyways, drama is slowly ending so I'm just gonna sit back and keep my mouth shut. I don't want it to explode again and cause me more problems. Short story, someone left the LS didn't go out gracefully and brought up things I've posted in the past here in my own blog saying they were recent and that I was harassing them. Turns out it wasn't me because you know, I have to be logged in to actually do any harassing. Plus my most recent mention of the said person was back in April. Now someone is claiming  that it was someone else etc etc you get the idea. So for now, I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut. 


All in all I'm looking forward to doing events again. We're doing Tinnin on Wednesday and Odin on Thursday. Tomorrow is Dynamis...err well technically today is Dynamis but no zone was listed yet. Buuut yeah, no mo drama plz.</center>"

Makin it offical. My LJ is now going to be ""Friend's Only"" since it seems that despite this being my own personal journal people still end up being butt hurt about my opinions. I swear people really need to get thicker skin when it comes to things. But anyways, ""Friend's Only"" journal is now a go. If you want access feel free to ask.

Also: friends only posts should obviously not be shared with people who aren't my friends. Considering something I said in a Friend's Only post which some how got used in something in a weak attempt at making me look bad. I have no respect for snitches since they'll always be bitches."

"event","Due to a lot of back and forth between a few key sacks in EM it looks like we're in for another major change. Members of the LS have gotten out of control and have gone to great lengths to cause grief on sacks during events. A few that come to mind is Thunderhawk going against orders during a Omega run. Arximiro getting all high and mighty about Snax's calling ability and actually posting it in plain view of Fur after Fur was told that Arx was in the process of harassing Snax. Also of Fishfoe who brags that he can get any person kicked from the LS if he bitches enough. It's nice to see what the members think of the actual sacks. Sooo Fur called a summer break for the LS just a week long one and during that time, he'll be re-examining the rules of the LS and then well there will be change. I'm not to worried about it though, I'm pretty sure that this time he'll follow through with the changes. I say this in regards to his attempt to establish LS order sometime during March but nothing was followed through. It just pretty much points out that with out Fur around the members don't give a shit about what the rest of us sacks want to do. And they'll go out of their way to disregard orders.


As for my break? I'm enjoying it so far. I've been playing Monster Hunter Freedom Unite a lot and god I love that game. Tai and I have been doing some duoing in it via PS3 Ad-hoc and he's gotten me some nifty armor and weapons which are pretty fucking awesome since I'm still learning how to play. 


I haven't logged on much other then a random Dynamis and Einherjar which netted us a Tier 3 win so we're making plans on hitting up Odin after the break. I had to clear out Zen's account because it looks like he's being forced to quit due to not having money to pay for it plus he'll be going to his dad's house on Sunday for two weeks then he starts work and school. Thus his play time and online time is going to be reduced to random days. BUT the upside is that he's planning on coming to visit me either during Christmas break or in the spring. Either or, I'm happy. xP


RL wise, Sammie's potty training is going on track she's actually making progress and has used the potty during the day. And the only time she's wearing a diaper is during her nap times and when she goes to bed. Which means she's on track to start pre-school soon. Well after we figure out if we're going to be moving or not. Also I'm still trying to find a job but it's really hard around here. So my mother is submitting my resume around at her office to get any openings. And I'm looking to return to school too and taking night classes. 


While changes are hard, and some don't want to go through with them, they must happen. Change comes from within and change can make a person better then what they are and do things they normally wouldn't be capable of. We adapt, we plow through and just continue to trudge though on a daily basis and look forward to what happens. I found out that one of my best friends that passed away recently...that she might have committed suicide. And it shocked me to the core. Apparently her RL was really...horrible and she decided to...well yeah...she pushed her car to the limit when she found out there was something wrong with it. Resulting in the car fire. When I heard about it, I felt numb. I knew what she was going through because I'm on the same path myself. I've come close to doing the same thing she has done a few times but never seem to do it. I think about what kind of world am I going to leave behind for my daughter, my friends and well my family. Would it have made things easier? Is that what I ultimately want? Sometimes I think that killing myself would be the best thing for me. I wouldn't have to worry about trying to find a job, finishing school, my mother's bitchy attitude which honestly doesn't help much. I've heard my mother on occasion telling me that Sammie is better off with out me because I'm not a good parent. And I sit back and wonder, am I a bad parent? What did I do wrong when it comes to my child. Is it because I let Sammie fall and hurt herself so she learns that her actions can hurt her? (If I know her life is in danger I put a stop to what ever she is doing.) Is it because it is taking her a little bit longer then ""normal"" to learn how to use the potty? Or write and read? Honestly I don't know how to be a parent. I just make sure she is fed, clean and entertained. Of course I love my daughter more then anything in this world and if it wasn't for her, I might have killed myself along time ago. 

Right now, the only thing I can do is keep going. Continue trying to find a job and maybe things will change."

I had fun nuking some of the people that were charmed last night. I nuked Aroth for roughly around 350, GG for 150 (he had Magic Defense gear on) and Yone for 250. All in all last night was kinda fun. Still though had some moments of irritation when I got tossed in the BLM party on my RDM again. Nothing like being a refresh whore for 99% of the time on your RDM. Wish they'd rotate the damn job so people that get special treatment get to do it too. 

Tonight we're having Einherjar T3 and hopefully we win. If we do I might go to Odin next week because its one of my favorite fights. Already kinda plan on going to ZNM's next week too so I'm not sure if my plan of taking a break was a good idea. But oh well. I really do need one and it was highly recommended by Fur. I just don't want it biting me in the ass and when I do come back from my break, I get cock blocked from obtaining things off my drop list."

Tuesday we redid Dynamis Qufim and thankfully this time we had success in beating the boss. Lost track of what AF dropped but had a lot.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/00046q1h/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/00046q1h/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""213"" border='0'/></a>

Being on RDM during Dynamis is a lot different then being on BLM. Unlike some RDM in my LS, I don't waste my MP nuking when I have to keep my party hasted/refreshed and cured. Since GG was the WHM in my party, I didn't have to worry over much about my party. So I spent the majority of the run curing the other parties since the WHM in the other party is kinda lazy. During the boss zerg, I targeted Elt who was on her DRK and yeah...her DRK while it has decent gear, she doesn't put it together to the point where it will be beneficial to her. The WHM in her party kept her at like 200 HP through out the whole zerg so I ended up cure bombing her. 

Wednesday was ZNM night but the main 3 leaders of the LS didn't have net access so we knocked down Anantaboga for a bunch of people. That was the only one we did that night so it was a early night kinda. 


Thursday was Einherjar and Fur wasn't there so the head decided we'll do a T1? I think? I don't remember but that run didn't go so good either. It seems like when Fur takes off, people barely listen or try their best. But oh well. 

All in all, last week was a bust. Hopefully this week looks up. I'm gonna try using my DNC more for things since it is a really fun. I got a new dagger for it too Adder Jambiya ftw. So far it is a pretty damn good dagger off handing with my Azoth."

"event","<h2>Monday</h2>
Monday is usually our boring day since its Limbus. Attendance was around the usual we had enough to farm two zones. I'll just talk about last night, which was Ultima. Which was pretty awesome since it has been a long time since we did Ultima. We had Greatguardian and Mitsukai tanking Ultima which was their first attempt. They both did amazingly good. Fur was on WAR which he rarely gets to go on during Omega/Ultima so he was pretty happy. Drop wise, Hands and Feet which went to Mits and Erised respectively.

<h2>Tuesday</h2>
Tuesday was Dynamis Qufim, which...did alright at the start of the run. AF rained down a little bit but nothing that people wanted. Think we got a 100 piece too but I don't remember that much. But the hiccup was during the boss pull. The idea is to have someone sac pull the goblins away from the boss and someone range attack the MB and pull it to the alliance. But when Meia went to pull the MB off Furby, she got one shotted. Fur kept trying to kite the MB so someone can try pulling it off him but that didn't work out. Thus re-attempting to pull the boss again even though we were really short on time. Volunteer's were called to try pulling the boss and the only person to volunteer was Elt. (Yeah...we already know what is going to happen. I won a nice amount of Gil on this pull.) Elt crept up towards the boss and was trying to hide by a wall. Only to...be spotted by the boss. She ran towards the alliance with the MB on her ass and the goblins followed the boss which caused a nice massive wipe. We didn't have time to recover so we just timed out. Snax and I decided to log out ASAP before our tempers got the better of us. Unfortunately we didn't escape the drama shit storm that followed the next few days. Apparently people were complaining about the last boss pull and how she didn't warn the alliance that she had aggro from the boss and goblins. People were pointing fingers left and right. And since everyone pretty much knows how much I dislike her yeah..we know what usually happens. But I'm not gonna elaborate on it much since its done and over with.

<h2>Wednesday</h2>
Wednesday was another round of ZNM's which I tell you is a bitch and a half all around. We did Dea a few times, followed by Experimental Lamia. There was also a spot of drama over a 30k Dark Grip and people wanting to leave the event in the middle of it. One of the poppers for Dea decided to lot all his drops to sell which is perfectly fine since it is a Tier 3 and it falls under your pop your drop rule. Someone took offense to it and words were said, in tells and in the LS which caused more drama to spill out. When told to stop fighting and focus on the event, the two continued till one decided to leave the run. We proceeded with the rest of the ZNM farming and let's just say, drama plus a trip through Caedarva Mire and Arrapago Reef does not equal to fun AT ALL. Drop wise was pretty good for some of the poppers while bad for some. I had a Experimental Lamia pop to get Enkidu's Sublingar for my DNC but unfortunately it did not drop. I did get one thing I wanted even though I don't have an actual use for it.

Experimental Lamia ready for her close up. She's one weird looking broad. 

<h2>Thursday</h2>
Thursday was Einherjar again we attempted a Tier 3 win only to be burned. Initial mobs were fine and they went down fast. But we ended up with Khim for a boss. And lets just say...
<lj-embed id=""4""/>
We lost the run which sucks and just delays our return to Odin. Luckily Belkin on BG had made a Tier 3 Guide <a href=""http://belkinator.livejournal.com/4558.html"">Belkin's Einherjar Tier 3 Guide</a> so hopefully we'll be doing a lot better from now on.

<h2>Friday</h2>
Friday the air con repair guy showed up to take a look at our unit. Turns out the motor is shot and nothing could be done till Monday. At least the weekend was nice and cool. The guy came back yesterday to pick up the motor so he could try and find a new/used of the same motor but he didn't have any luck trying to find a new motor. It turns out, our unit is outdated and they don't make it anymore. I guess now he is trying to find a used one but I really doubt...it. Which means we won't have air con for the summer which sucks really badly. I'm looking into how much its going to cost to get a new unit but unfortunately I wouldn't be able to afford it at all. And my mom refuses to get a new one because she sucks at saving her money and ends up buying useless crap we don't need. And she's not willing to ask her boyfriend for help. Also, last week, she stayed at her boyfriends house and left Sammie and I to deal with the heat on our own. Isn't that fucking awesome? /sigh

<h2>Saturday</h2>
Saturday we went back to Nyzul Isle with my SP. The idea was to do 2/3 boss floors and one climb for me. First Boss climb we ran out of time due to having Soulflayers as the first objective. And those fuckers just suck so badly. My climb didn't go good either and we ran out of time on the 4th floor. Last boss climb we were running short on time so we decided to zerg the boss. I got this from it.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/0003qhhg/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aries_black/pic/0003qhhg/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""213"" border=""0"" /></a>
So it wasn't all that bad of a run. 

<h2>Sunday</h2>
Sunday was Divine Might with Ziero's Linkshell. We had to revamp a few times since some people from EM didn't make it. But we had enough people.

The idea for this run was to Super Tank it. Which means a awesomely geared PLD will get initial aggro of the NM's and stand in one corner while the rest of the group pulls one mob off him at a time. Unfortunately he died fast because the support group was not positioned to great. I told the alliance to try and kill the Mithra one then wipe. Luckily before we did wipe, they managed to kill her. After RR'ing and recovering we reattempted the rest of the NM's. The BLM's manaburned the Elvaan down while the DD took down the Galka. Elvaan and Galka went down and we had a slight hiccup when the puller died before he could peel the Hume off Furby. But we still managed it just fine. Saved the Taru for last since he never leaves the circle.

Got my Suppa earring for my DNC. Which is pretty awesome. 

OH I finally finished my idle set for RDM and BLM. Had someone in the LS make this for me.

"event","Usual roll of events, Limbus on Monday split zone and a lot of coins and unwanted AF items. Tuesday we had Dynamis Xarc again which was pretty nifty. Nothing all that useful dropped again which was disappointing. I didn't stay up for the whole run since I was running on 4 hours of sleep that night. 

Wednesday was our first return to ZNM's which had a great turn out. We did, Mahjlaef the Paintorn which is a bitch to get too. God I haaate Caedarva Mire with a passion. True sight/sound mobs all the fuckin way. The fight itself wasn't that bad, we had Snax tanking on his RDM with Thunder co-tanking. So damn proud of him for being able to tank and not letting his being Elvaan and lack of MP pool get in the way of being an awesome tank. Mahjlaef was a huge pain in the ass for almost anything. It'll randomly put up shields to prevent DD damage or Magic Damage so it was a hit or miss. Drops were pretty decent can't remember off the top of my head what all dropped but some people got what they wanted. After Mahjlaef we did Gotoh Zha the Redolent, annnd that one was kinda fun fight. But by then I was already on auto pilot mode. Goteh is a interesting fight, he starts off as BLM first with BLM abilities and two-hour. He's a kited fight so the BLMs positioned ourselves in one corner of the tower and nuked him when the DD's weapon skilled to create magic bursts. And if you break his staff he switches to WHM with WHM two hour which itself is a biiiitch. Nothing like getting a NM down to 10% only for it to use Bendiction to cure it self to full. I got out lotted for Enkidu's mitts so many times it made my DNC cry. 

Thursday was Einherjar T3 and we had another crappy draw with mobs. We didn't win it but yeah we had a horrible boss that a lot of people would just drop lamp for. After Einherjar, we attempted to do ACP11 for Yone but Zai kept DC'ing so we decided to do it some other night. Friday was horrible all round. Thunderstorms and flood warning in my area so my power and connection kept going in and out. And since our air conditioning unit is broken, it was hot as hell.

Saturday, I wasn't feeling all that good so I stayed in bed all day mostly. Saturday night we finally did ACP 11 for Yone but lost the first attempt because we tried zerging it. We debated for almost 2 hours while Zen went to drop off his RL friend if we should do a few Nyzul Isle floors or reattempt ACP11. Yone figured she'll climb back up the tower just in case we do. And since it was getting really late and the heat was sapping my energy we decided to redo ACP11 for Yone and call it a night. 


Sunday was another day I spent in my bed except to go to Subway to get lunch. I'm still feeling a bit weak but eh it'll pass. Sunday night we did Bv1 for some LS members and some random friends to help out when they needed it. It took us a while to set up since people didn't show up and we replaced some people. We ended up zerging it instead which was pretty awesome.

"event","Monday was Limbus, since we've established a schedule we don't have to worry about people constantly asking what zone we're doing. We've established a 4 week rotation, which means 4 weeks Appolyon and 4 weeks Temenos. Which means we'll be doing more Omega's then Ultima's but there is no other way to make it too fair.

Tuesday was the first time in weeks that we've been able to get into Dynamis Xarc. We had a slew of AF drops but nothing noteworthy. I managed to get Summoner Horn for my level 20 Summoner though. Since people were expecting to end up in another zone we had a bunch of people that didn't bother showing up. So we just went for a farming run instead of aiming for a win. Fur DC'd sometime during the beginning so we had some issues with calling out drops but Erised and Snax managed to handle it. The only major downside is that I saw BLM Relic Hat go to a WHM main which kinda pissed me off but what can you do when they decide to put it #1 on their list. Sometimes the system sucks. 

Wednesday we did Kirin x2. First one was zerged which went pretty damn good. Almost full drops? I think. Second one was kinda bleh. I'd go into detail but people would think I'm trying to start drama. I felt bad for Snax since he really wanted W.Legs but it went to someone else. That makes it a point to avoid going to events as PLD. But again, it just falls under the way our lotting system is set up. 

Thursday was Einherjar Wing 2 and we're one week away from Odin #2 depending if we get the win in Wing 3 this week. As usual nothing note worthy dropped except for Wootz ore which goes to LS bank I think. We haven't gotten any abj.s to drop since we did Odin. It's kinda depressing but can't really do much about that either. 

Weekend was uneventful, nothing really much to do over the weekend. I fixed my convert set on RDM so I'm close to 1k/1k HP/MP wise. Still need Faerie Hairpin but its hard to come by so Snax and I decided to try doing Bionic Bug for it. Our attempt though got cut off short when we realized we didn't have enough people to get to the BC. So we just warped and headed to Qufim to do a Qufim burn pt. I got my DRK to 37 finally so Fur can stop complaining about the lack of RDM/DRK's in the ls. Although I still don't see a point in it when I'm on BLM 99.9% of the time. But I guess its nice to have for other events. 

I want to tweak all my sets again to get the best out of all of em so I'm not gimp in any way. Which includes making sure my subjobs are all leveled. Which means, I'll be working on THF and SAM sub for DNC soon but I want to focus on my Summoner more.

This morning I took a look at FFXIDats to see if they had anything new and I found the cutest outfit ever!

The ""Mithra"" ears is my Zenith Crown. I couldn't find anything appealing to change it too so I left it as is. I changed how my stave's look and now they look really awesome and bad ass at the same time. I'm on the Airship on my way to Kazham to get a Tuning Fork of Fire and gonna ride to Norg to get the Eye of Nept. I'm currently working on doing some Avatar Battles to get my Evoker's Ring.

All in all, the week wasn't so bad. Just needed a bit more ""happy"" but w/e."

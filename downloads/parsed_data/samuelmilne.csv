"event","I've found in this class that many of the skills being shown so far i already knew to a basic extent. The abilities are being refined though, allowing me to be more efficient in my researching, and more resources for me to use to get my point across. The class is enjoyable, and i'm hoping to learn even more as time goes on. I justhope there aren't any more papers to write. i find them immensely difficult, especially with the existing workload. I just hope i can make it through everything, and keep my marks up."

"event","I have found our instructors do thier job well... they instruct in a way that allows for easy correllation and retention of taught skills. What they do specifically, is TEACH. They explain, they show, and they expand on ideas presented, alowing student to learn in a comfortable environment. I do find the instructors sometimes move too quickly from point to point, and sometimes do not have enough time to truly cover and allow for exploration of learned topics. I wish that classes could be more uniform in timings, and even more so I wish students would not be so rushed to complete tasks, so the environment would be less intensive, and more suited to learning."

"event","Well, Where to start... My name is Samuel Milne, I'm 28 years old, About 6 feet tall, blonde hair, Blue eyes, and i'm scared to death about research and more specifically Citing.

Citing is a Necessary evil... yes i am always afraid i might inadvertantly place something written or donee by nother person... but anyways... back to me... sorta.

I'm a gamer. always will be and have been. I want to get into the design aspects fo game design. and maybe learn some artistic skills in the process, while making new friends, and even more so. The workload is going to be a time management nightmare though, as assignments, without the programs is going to be very very hard.

The entire course is so far pretty easy to understand, yet i have trouble with the amount of interaction, and the speed of the teaching. i feel alot of things are rushed, when it is the work during the class which most benefits me. i hope i can remember and sort all the information."

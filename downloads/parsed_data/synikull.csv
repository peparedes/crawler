"event","So I finally got story 2 done a few days late. I had to do a lot more research on it than I did for the first story.<br />Also: kisses are hard to write. It makes me wonder about sex scenes...those must be horrible.<br /><br />I'm planning to crack down and get all my CIS&nbsp;caught up...I've been lazy. I&nbsp;was kind of confused by last weeks lesson since it was stuff that I&nbsp;had almost no experiance in, but it's stuff that I&nbsp;<em>want </em>to know. I also figured out why I&nbsp;bring up porn so much in that classroom. Someone inevitably says something that reminds me of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEjvCRPrCo"">this video</a> which is not surprising considering what the class is about. And with the way my mind works I&nbsp;just...fasten onto it. If something catches my attention beforehand (like lasers) then I talk about that jokes about it instead.<br /><br />So I&nbsp;was planning to see if Paula wanted to hang out and get some coffee on friday. I&nbsp;had it all planned out. Go to Staples, give Phil his camera back, go to Bi-Mart and ask Paula. Wrong order. I always end up talking to phil about some retarded thing for 45 minutes. So when I finally did make it to Bi-Mart, yes Paula was there doing her cashier thing, but when I&nbsp;found the pumpkin (my excuse for going in there) and made it back up she was gone. I waited and waited and goofed off, hoping she would come back. She didn't. So I fianlly checked out. The nice older lady that was doing it asked me how I&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;told her I&nbsp;was depressed that&nbsp;I missed Paula. She thought it was sweet and then 'lo and behold, Paula walks by. 95% sure she didn't hear us talking about her.&nbsp;She was really nice and tried to hurry but I missed her anyway. <br />Then yesterday I&nbsp;went to Walmart with my mom. We were there for way too long...it was redonkulous in there. I got a haircut and we did some shopping. On our way out I&nbsp;saw Paula walking in with her mom. I&nbsp;said hi and I actually heard her say hi back. I think I'm making a little bit of progress. It might have helped that&nbsp;I spent half the class period at her group on Thursday, though. Ariel and I&nbsp;got lost on a problem that we worked on together.<br /><br />No epic WoW&nbsp;things to talk about.&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest thing I&nbsp;can come up with is doing a full BRD&nbsp;run last night. It sucked...took hours. I didn't have the key and had to go get it in the middle of the instance. I&nbsp;also found if you don't kill everyone in the emperor's room they all agro. That was hillarious. I'm 74 and they're 55 elites, but there were so many of them, plus the boss, that they kicked my ass.&nbsp;I also found I can swim in lava for a very long time.<br /><br />I also think I might be getting sick. Boooooo@sick.<br /><br />"

WHAT&nbsp; IS&nbsp; WRONG&nbsp; WITH&nbsp; MEEEEEE?&nbsp;&nbsp; Insightful and Dave pitched in to help me buy my flying mount so I could run Mechanar with Insightful. It was an awesome group, we had almost no downtime. We only wiped once on the fire boss because we all forgot about the fire elemental adds. After that one of the guys asked if we wanted to run Kara. So all but one of us went.&nbsp; I only went as far as the Curorator, but that plus Mech = a good 4 hours. Anyway, the whole time the mage and I were talking on and off, making jokes and stuff. We scheduled to do Mech again the next day.</p><p><br />She got on an hour early for Mech (while Insightful got on an hour and a half LATE...jackass...)and we did dalies together. Turns out her name is Amber Leigh (sexy, no?) and she's 21 too. I started hitting on her in the most obvious and retarded way possible just for kicks. Actually, I had done that the night before, too. We both had lots of luls over it.&nbsp; She only said Oh&nbsp; Shit once instead of the 10+ times she did the night before, and she sounded a lot better. I guess she was getting sick or something. She has the cutest laugh. &lt;3 So I&nbsp; am, by my own definition, an idiot.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, I'm trying to get caught up in school I&nbsp; got pissed off at blackbored and just stopped doing stuff. It doesn't like firefox, so I have to use IE, and IE&nbsp; doesn't like my computer for some reason. It randomly crashes. Microsoft ftl.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Mike is coming over on Sunday.

Anyway, the whole time I was there was marred by the jackasses on motorcycles. They would rev them up and seemed to be having contests to see who could get it louder. Yeah, it was part of the the fest to have motorcycles there, but there were being jerks.

The muffin top all the ""extra"" that couldn't fit into it. It's rather disgusting. I saw five of them. Muffin top busts are not attractive.

"event","So.
First, seasonal affective disorder is kicking my ass. Hard. I'm down to 2 classes. Acting and Photography. Whoo. You sure are taking a hard load, Ryan.
Second. I am doing sound for Romeo and Juliette. It is eating my time. More than Warcraft. I've been going at 6:30 and not getting home until 11:30 or 12:30. I think I've maybe played Warcraft that much once. It's fun but the director is really...I don't know...I don't like talking to her. She scares me. It shouldn't be too hard though. I wait for the stage manager to say Sound cue X go and I push play. I do have to adjust the volume from clip to clip, but nothing too hard.
Third. I kissed a guy yesterday. On the lips. Joey, to be exact. He and a really cute girl were in a contest to see who could get the most kisses (on the lips) on valentines day. She won. I kissed her, too. Right before I kissed him. He was all triumphant until she told him. I don't think I would have kissed him if there hadn't been so many people around. I think that girls find guys kiss each other as hot as guys find girls kiss each other. Because it was mostly girls egging us on. It was weird, he said ""Come on, Ryan"" and puckered his lips way out and I told him no. If I was going to kiss him it was going to be a real kiss, not some fake ass shit. And he was confused. So I just kissed him. It wasn't that bad. I felt weird afterwards, and I had a weird taste on my lips for a few minutes, but it wasn't&nbsp; as...hard...I suppose. I guess I always thought a guys lips would be harder or coarser. And then Joey was trying to get Michael(?) to kiss him, and he wouldn't, but he kept pressuring him. He was thinking about it and Joey just went in for the kill and he freaked out. I think that was his first kiss, too. Poor guy. He's sort of a homophobe too. It was awesome.
Anyway. I can tell this weekend is going to be horrible. Erin is in the hospital. I'm busy all day tomorrow so I can't go see her. I have to do Sunday School on Sunday because she can't, so I'm going to be late to rehearsal then.and then go until who knows when Sunday night. I'll have no time to rest and I won't be able to go see Erin, and I feel horrible about it. :S"

"event","So I've been working a lot this week. On my feets a lot. They started really hurting about an hour into my shift. I knew the next 6 hours would be hard. Not only did my feet hurt horribly, but I was running on about 4 hours sleep and no substantial meals. I had a coffee at about 9 and a small snack-sized muffin at about 10:30 with a glass of milk, then a small piece of fudge at about 2:45. Then went to work.
So by about 5:00 I was running low on energy big time. I took a break when Terry left, leaving Cody in charge. Yes, there were 3 of us there. Usually times overlap by an hour. This time there were 3 of us there for 2 hours. Crazy. 
hen about 8:15 I had to get off my feet. They were about to a'splode.&nbsp; I talked with a really funny Asian guy on my break. He wouldn't tell me anything about himself. He kept suggesting really weird things too, like that my flu shot was just a saline solution and that they reused needles. He had a mustache that was made of win. So I ate two donuts and drank most of a Monster Khaos energy drink and I was good for a while. So I went back to work. I then proceeded to walk up to someone in a baseball cap and a baggy jacket.
""Can I help you find anything, sir?""
They turned around. The face was rather young looking. I thought, 'Oh, this is just a kid.'
Then with a small smile and a very feminine voice, they replied ""I'm good, thanks.""
Then it hit me. I about died. I knew it was going to happen soon, but I wasn't prepared for it when it did. It was awful. I literally staggered backwards, spilling with apologies. She kept insisting it was ok. I was horrified.
Lessee.
Sometime during my shift I went to show someone something and then got ambushed by a gaggle of women. The one closest to me held up some baby formula and said ""Do you have any more of this? There's only one on the shelf.&nbsp; I have wick and I need 5.""
""Um...ok, let me go get Rich""
She was speaking greek. I'm not going to go into what W.I.C.K. is, but I learned a good deal about it. They eventually got their stuff after about 5-10 minutes. Then in about another 2 minutes one of them backed into a table full of pies.
It was awesome. The look on her face was worth it.
We had people from 4 departments come and see what happened. 
Brenna, the girl I went through orientation with and have since become friends with, saw it and decided she wanted no part of it. She's so funny.
Turns out that she broke the table. We spent a good 15 minutes trying to figure out what to do. We finally decided on duct-taping the leg and putting the pies back on.
I returned to produce about 45 minutes after I left. I realized how much I dislike being there.
So I spent half an hour afterwards shopping. I couldn't remember what I wanted to get. I ended up saying screw it and buying the stuff I had and going home. Just about as soon as I got home I got the foot soaker out and plopped my feet in some hot water and Epsom salts. It was amazing. Some time and about 4 Super Mario Galaxy stars later (I died a lot) I pulled my feet out. Theres a big blister on my big toe. It hurts. And while my feet aren't screaming like they were, they still ache.
And I have work to look forward to tomorrow. Whoop-de-do. Well, at least I'm going to get a warm thanksgiving meal with nearly-family. I'm thankful for that. It almost didn't happen.

Oh, I'm also really liking this new Seal album. It's like the last one in that I didn't like it at first, but the more I listen to it the more I like it. System is a great album. I've been waiting for Seal to come out with a new album!"

"event","So I've been really stressed out lately. Started on at Albertsons and I've had what seems like loads of homework. I had to miss a day of speech so I could get orientatated at Albertson's , and then it seems like it has been moving on without me. This was two mondays ago. He gave out info on the persuasive speech that day, and I missed it. He gave us a week to do it. I was so preoccupied with work that I didn't really start thinking about it until friday, giving me 3 days to write it. I didn't really come up with a topic until mid saturday, and I spent most of sunday writing it, up until about 2:30 am. So I was wiped on monday, and spent a good deal of speech praying that he wouldn't pull my name out of the bucket (that's how he does it). He didn't, so I had until wednesday to practice and get things all set up right. I neglected to do that because I was working on photography instead (I'll post some more photos when I get around to it). So on tuesday I woke up at about 12:15 and spent 30 minutes finishing up my photography homework and then put some clothes on and went to class. I put some stuff in mom's new storage and then went to bi-mart, got home then went to Albertson's with dad. I was pretty worn out by the time we got back and kinda crashed again. So I worked on getting stuff together and I had to re-write my note cards and buy a videotape before speech class. I was the second or third one to go. It was awful. I had some really bad pauses. I lost my place a couple times. I forgot to use two of my overheads. nrrrg.
But then there was Forrest. He gave his speech on building artificial shorelines to protect us against tsunamis. Yeah. Really. He didn't even take it seriously. He cracked up about 3 times during his speech. It was hilarious.
So I went to work a couple hours after that.
My feet ended up killing me again. And the really friendly heavyset guy came in again. I like him. He seemed happy to see me. I helped him find some good deals. I moved a coupon from one bottle of salad dressing to the one he wanted. It made me laugh inside, but it made him happy, which also made me happy.
So when I got home at 8 Phillip was here. Him and Tyler were playing Wii Sports. I got in on the action after a while. It was fun. WE watched the new southpark too. It was about guitar hero. So I got the broken wired guitar out and tried to see if it was fixable. It's FUBAR. But still useable. Which doesn't make sense, but oh well.
So anyway, dad came home while it was still out, and I explained guitar hero to him. We ended up playing it for about an hour. It was really fun.
Then I came in here.
I have more stuff to talk about, like my lightscribe drive. But I'm beat. I think&nbsp; I'm going to sleep for a good 10-12 hours. My body needs the rest from being all stressed.
I've also been listening to a lot of bleach music. It's good. :3"

At least this time I didn't have to actually call them and sit through the &quot;Have you shared your windows key with anyone?&quot; spiel. 

Anyway, got my new CD drive. I actually ordered it for my mom, but then after I ordered it I realized her computer won't have SATA, so I ended up taking it and she's getting my old one. Kinda crappy of me, I know, but the order had already been processed and I didn't want to pay another $50-$60 to get a new one and have it get here on time.

Lets see...did my speech on Wednesday because Mr. Gill is awesome. I was supposed to do it Monday but I didn't feel too well, and I sent him an email and then went to his office after my first class on Wednesday. So at the beginning of class I gave my speech on Edgar Allan Poe and The Raven. I did pretty good. I flubbed up the second stanza (or rather, second to last) not once, but twice. I did get a comment saying &quot;badass gestures&quot; though, and no one gave me really negative feedback like they did last time, so I guess that's good. I think I did alright on it. I'll go get my grade tommarrow and actually see.

The surprise party isn't happening, which makes me sad. Ron and Susan are going to be busy getting ready for the Christmas something or other...before Halloween. David and Penny are in Iowa. So that rained on my parade. 

FINALLY moving forward on my Albertson's job. I filled out paperwork today and I go in on Monday for my orientation. Woot. Monies. 

Oh yea. I think my dad is mad at me. I don't know why. I've done a few idiotic but easily remedied things over the past few days.&nbsp; I started bringing in groceries instead of helping my mom unload stuff from a pickup (which looked easy/light enough) and my dad got on me about it. And then I said I didn't see the difference and he got irritated. Then he brought it up today...kind of like he'd been fuming about it, which is really unlike him. But my mom asked me why he was mad at her, so maybe he's just in a bad mood.

Mom had Jason (the guy that lives downstairs...big, intimidating, works at the prison and shaves his head) &quot;serve&quot; Jim the divorce papers(He got SERVED! ...lol). Apparently he called her and the first thing he said was fuck off. Lol. I almost feel sorry for him sometimes, living so detached from reality like that, but then I think of all the shit he's put my mom through and I don't feel so bad about that, or the fact that my mom is going after half of his retirement. Another lol. Honestly though, I don't think he'll live to see retirement. He basically has cancer in his mouth. Not to mention all his weight and blood pressure problems. I'm going to get the full story about what he said to my mom for almost an hour tonight and his reaction from Jason tommarrow. According to Jim, though, Casey started crying. Which probably means that Casey's eyes got wide. Kinda like that time I handed Jim the phone as he walked out the door and he went on and on and on to Mom (who was on the phone) about how he got &quot;shoved the phone in the car!&quot;

Ok. I'm out. I'm also dizzy and tired.

Next time I post I'm going to rant about people in wal-mart. :3"

"event","I took care of the downstairs neighbors girls this evening. Well, it was supposed to be my dad, but I took over almost immediately. They read as I made dinner. I ate with them and entertained them as we did. Then I took them downstairs and we played go fish with my jumbo cards. The kindergartener won. She cheated, as most kids that age do, but it was fun anyway. After that I told them to get ready for bed, then I went down and read Dr Seuss to them. I had a great time. Amber wants me to go to see her get an award on Wednesday. They both made me pictures for making them dinner. They're so cute. They misspelled my name. Rine. I hope if I have girls that they're that cute and that sweet.

Anyway. I went and took my drug test for Albertson's today. First I had to wait 15 minutes for the book keeper to get back. Then we found out that I wasn't in the system anymore. Applicants are supposed to stay in the system 90 days before being deleted and moved to the deleted folder. I applied late September/Early October...I'm not sure which. The Produce manager had printed my application off 4 days earlier, but I was completely gone. Not even in the deleted folder. So I had to go apply again. Then I went back in and read a bunch of stuff and singed a bunch of stuff. One was kind of creepy. It was basically giving a 3rd party permission to observe me. I have a right to get the results...but still...it's creepy. As I was reading and signing the deli manager had to talk about the deals today over the PA system. It was ""Cheap Chicken Monday"" or something like that...and as she said it she clapped silently. It was funny. She was really embarrassed afterwards. After that they sent me to Fruitland to take the actual test. I had some...performance anxiety. I almost didn't make the required 45ml. After that, I went to Game Stop, and as I was pulling into the parking lot I got a phone call from Bi-Mart. ""You still looking for a job?""

So after lunch I had to go to Social Security Administrations to ask for a new card. I have no idea where mine is and I need it for Albertson's. Then I went to Wal-Mart to get insoles for my Doc Martin's. 

I went to Staples to look for a new case for my Treo. My current one keeps dumping my Treo out on the ground. I saw one I want to try, but it's $40. After Staples I went to look at Radio Shack and talked to Adam. Then I went next door and spent a while with Ron and Susan. I think I might go back tomorrow and get some pictures of flowers for my photography assignment. 

I grabbed a smoothie and then my mom called me. She had her checks and wanted to meet me at my bank. She had borrowed $350 and was using the checks to pay me back. But instead she deposited her entire paycheck and a couple others because hers got closed because of Jim. So now I have her money. I don't know what's going on. I'm kind of alarmed though. Her and I have had money issues before. She doesn't ask to borrow money...she just does. Most of the time she doesn't pay it back. This just feels like a bad idea.

Anyway. I'm out."

"event","Well, if you haven't already heard but <a href=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/sonic.html"">Sonic</a> is in Super Smash Brothers: Brawl. Crazy, eh? Well, not so much when you consider that <a href=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/snake.html"">Snake</a> is in it as well. But still. Sonic?<br /><br />What else?<br /><br />Oh, I started my bleach sound scheme. I have Byakuya saying ""Bankai - Senbonzakura Kageyoshi"", ""Senkai Senbonzakura Kageyoshi"" (second form, scene of the massacre) and whatever ""Final View: White Imperial Sword"" is, along with Cherie (Scatter) and Destructive Art 4: white lightning. All this was from episode 58-59-60. I think I might go find the other times he does bankai and get some sounds from there. Maybe I should get him saying ""Impossible!"" for my shutdown sound? <br /><br />I gave my first speech on J. Robert Oppenheimer earlier in the week, Monday to be exact, and it went pretty well except for the times when I lost my place. Manuscript speeches aren't my cup of tea. Next up is memorization. I'm going to do part of The Raven. I'm excited, but&nbsp; I can't decide what part I'm going to do. I'm leaning towards the last 2 or 3 stanzas, but it's hard to give such an epic poem justice in a minute. <br /><br />Got an interview at Albertsons on Saturday. I was kind of short with the guy when he called me though, so I have to appologize for that first thing. I was in class though. It was working time, so I was able to go out and answer it, but still...<br />Anyway. That's about all I can think of.<br /><br />I'll have a photo dump some time before Monday at 1. Yes, I am using this to post my photography."

        					<div><small>This test measured 4 variables.</small><P>

<font color=""red"">First, this test measured if you place a higher value on <b>words</b> or <b>actions</b>.  Both have their own advantages.  For instance a skilled negotiator and a skilled firefighter both save lives.</font><P>

<font color=""blue"">Second, this test compared your <b>intrapersonal</b> and <b>interpersonal</b> intelligences.  Simply put intrapersonal intelligence means <i>you understand yourself</i>, while interpersonal intelligence means <i>you understand others</i>.</font><P>

<font color=""green"">Third, this test measured if you are more <b>book smart</b> or <b>street smart</b>.  Book smart people may be more interested in a variety of topics, while street smart people focus on the most relevant information.  Smurfette is very street smart, while Poet Smurf is not.</font><P>

<font color=""brown"">Fourth, this test measured if you prefer an <b>artistic</b> or <b>functional</b> approach to life.  Artistic people may concentrate more on details and ambiance, while functional people focus on if it works.  In this case Vanity Smurf would be considered Artistic while Hefty Smurf just wants to lift stuff up.</font><P>

You are <b>more</b> word driven, <b>more</b> interpersonal</b>, <b>more</b> book smart</b>, and <b>more</b> artistic.<p>

Let's find out why you are Poet Smurf!<p>

<font color=""navy"">Poety Smurf is obviously more interested in words than action.  He spends most of his time just writing away.  Like Poet Smurf you understand the value of the pen.  You understand that words can often be more effective than force.  Your high interpersonal intelligence suggests that you know other people well.  Poet Smurf loves sharing his masterpieces with others.<P>

You probably are more comfortable learning about something new instead of jumping right into it.  Poet Smurf is so book smart oriented that his daydreaming often gets him into danger.  Finally he uses his writing to reveal his artistic side.  Like Poet Smurf you appreciate art, creativity and design.</font><p>


The 16 possible smurf categories are...<P>
Lazy Smurf, Slouchy Smurfling, Hefty Smurf, Papa Smurf, Jokey Smurf, Grouchy Smurf, Sassette Smurfling, Grandpa Smurf, Handy Smurf, Dreamy Smurf, Painter Smurf, Poet Smurf, Baker Smurf, Vanity Smurf, Smurfette, Tailor Smurf<P>

      <h1><!--t-->Your Score<!--/t-->: <span>Snuffleupagus</span></h1>
      <h2>You scored 45% Organization, 63% abstract,  and 52% extroverted!</h2>
       <div id=""testResultInfoImg""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/users/168/570/16957172787179881552/mt1135839728.jpg""></div> 
      <p>
      <font size=""-2"">This test measured 3 variables. </font></p><p>
<font color=""red"">First, this test measured how <b>organized</b> you are.  Some muppets like Cookie Monster make big messes, while others like Bert are quite anal about things being clean. </font></p><p>
<font color=""blue"">Second, this test measured if you prefer a <b>concrete</b> or an <b>abstract</b> viewpoint.  For the purposes of this test, concrete people are considered to gravitate more to <i> mathematical and logical approaches</i>, whereas abstract people are more the <i> dreamers and artistic type.</i></font></p><p>
<font color=""green"">Third, this test measured if you are more of an <b>introvert</b> or an <b>extrovert.</b>  By definition, an introvert concentrates more on herself and an extrovert focuses more on others.  In this test an introvert was somebody that either tends to spend more time alone or thinks more about herself. </font></p><p>
You are <b>somewhat</b> organized, <b>both </b>concrete and abstract, and <b>both </b>introverted and extroverted.</p><p>

I bet you didn't think you were Snuffleupagus.  Let's find out why.</p><p>

<font color=""purple"">You are both somewhat organized.  You have a good idea where you put things and you probably keep your place reasonably clean.  You aren't totally obsessed with neatness though.  Alloyius Snuffleupagus (and all Snuffleupagus') is not sloppy by nature, but he moves so incredibly slowly that it is impossible for him to be totally organized.<br><br>
You both are about equally concrete and abstract thinkers.  You have a good balance in your life.  You know when to be logical at times, but you also aren't afraid to explore your dreams and desires... within limits of course.  Snuffy generally has very basic interests, but he explores his abstract sensitive side when he plays his snuffleflute.<br><br>
You both are somewhat introverted.   Originally Snuffleupagus was very shy and was only Big Bird's invisible friend.  However as he has aged he has started to build new friendships with new characters. Like Snuffy, you probably like to have some time to yourself.  However, you do appreciate spending time with your friends, and you aren't scared of social situations.  </font></p><p></p><p>
The other possible characters are<br><b>
<font color=""brown"">Oscar the Grouch<br>
Big Bird<br>
Cookie Monster<br>
Ernie<br>
Elmo<br>
Kermit the Frog<br>
Grover<br>
The Count<br>
Guy Smiley<br>
Bert

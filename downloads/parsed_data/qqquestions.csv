he's obviously too scene for his own good,

"event","i defintely got SERIOUS hate mail
from my last post. don't lie.
i know everytime you see some real attractive scene boy
holding hands with a slutty/preppy looking girl.
(this is from a scene girls point of view)
you probably THINK & WONDER why he's with her,
and why won't someone that scene look at you?
cause you're a little scene girl? what's going on?




stop giving up your virginity so early.
later in life you won't be so happy.
say no to sluts! say no to boys!"

preppy girls, with extremly scene boys?
preppy boys, with extremly scene girls?


let the scene be with the scene.
let the preppy be with the preppy.
it's almost like mixing a species.

This girl is so unbelievably gorgeous. It amazes me. Imagine how attractive her parents are? Or were? Or whatever. 


Me & my friend were discussing this. How do you get that gorgeous? Too much makeup? Or just born that way? Bet she gets all the boys, & bet she gets a lot of kisses. Virgin? No way.




I'm getting personal here.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy."

Ever wonder why Pete Wentz is the most famous one? I mean he's the bassist. Wasn't the bassist usually the most ignored one? [Ex. Good Charolette] So why is he usually in the front for almost all the pictures of the band? Shouldn't that be the lead singer there?


'My P33n Is More Famous Then Me.'
Yes, Pete. Yes it is. 
Lesson learned: Don't send n00dz to a girl,
They'll get all over the internet.






Btw, it's called shaving Pete!"

I find that to be the stupidest question/quote ever.
Don't you? Well, you probably should.




Why do we have boyfriends/girlfriends at a younger age. Like 14 - 18. Because in the end you're just gonna get heartbroken. So what's the point? Why start so early?, You only know you're in for a heartbreak."

I know it comes to mind.

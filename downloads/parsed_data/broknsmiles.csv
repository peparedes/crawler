Trishy says:
i hated hawaii
Micah says:
why?
Trishy says:
because everyone was giving me a hard time about talking 2 manda while i was there.  neil had just dumped her.
Micah says:
well thats just ur dumb class..
Trishy says:
mr borton was all like, ""not only is it annoying but it's rude.""  bs, it's not rude to be there for your best friend
Trishy says:

Micah says:
What?
Micah says:
what was he saying was rude!?
Trishy says:
me talking to manda making sure she was okay cuz she was bawling!
Micah says:
wow..
Trishy says:
mmhmm, i was all crying in the car and he's all, ""what's that lip sticking out for?  don't pout!""  larsen had 2 tell him to back off
Micah says:
well im sure mr borton didnt know the whole story... 
Trishy says:
everyone esle in the car did.  i dunno, to make a long story short i just hated that trip.  lol, but it did have some good points.  i mean c'mon, it WAS hawaii
Micah says:
hahaha see? larson is awsome!
Trishy says:
lol, i love larsen even if he is annoying and thinks i'm irresponsible
Micah says:
yea..
Trishy says:
he makes me laugh with his ""history"" and ""geography"" skills.  i can't believe i never listened 2 him b4.  he's so much fun!
Micah says:
hahah see?
Micah says:
i have found that moast teachers are cool, its just that they have built up a wall because they have so many stupid students,
Trishy says:
lol, hecks yes they do
Micah says:
yea..
Trishy says:
lol, u know nathan's brother?
Trishy says:
have u ever met him b4?
Micah says:
no..
Micah says:
why?
Trishy says:
oh, he's a freshmen and his name is matt.  he's SO funny and he's SO SMART like no joke!  but he's nothing like nathan, he's way cool.  but yeah, he's always arguing with mr larsen and he's like...so right all the time!  so larsen likes matt
Trishy says:
that's my other little freshmen buddy.  ^_^
Micah says:
hahahah
Micah says:
cool
Micah says:
i dont know..
Micah says:
i tried to talk to nathan a few times...
Micah says:
but i dont think he liked me just because the popular crowd didnt like me, and he was trying to gain their approval..
Trishy says:
LOL, never try to talk to nathan!!!  he's so annoying!  we were talking about him and how he's so random that IF he ever got laid he'd prolly yell out something stupid and random like H...2...O!!!!  lol.  2 funny
Trishy says:
the popular crowd LOVED you micah!!!
Micah says:
umm no.
Trishy says:
nathan was/is just a retard
Trishy says:
yes!!!  everybody loved you
Micah says:
HA! no ur wrong.
Trishy says:
lol, nope.  ^_^  
Micah says:
im talking like... in my class. peeps like max, trevor, that one girl i disliked so much i for got her name on purpose....
Micah says:
that whole preppy/ popular crowd.
Trishy says:
who?  katie wright?  i dunno...trevor and max are idiots tho.  lol, i call him magical trevor now.  it's so funny
Micah says:
not katie.. umm
Trishy says:
he has this high pitched squeaky voice that mimics it and he goes, ""magical TREVOR!!!""  lol
Micah says:

Micah says:
no you miss my point.
Trishy says:
lol, jamieson called megan, katie and someone else the three twinkies cuz they were so stupid!
Trishy says:
u need a cell phone u know that?  lol.  then i can randomly text u throughout the day.  
Micah says:
i didnt like her. i tried talking to her once and she made fun of me for talking to her.... my point was that nathan always tried to hang with that whole crowd, and they didnt like me, and thats why i think nathan didnt like me.
Trishy says:
nathan just gave up.  ^_^  he's finally accepted the fact that he's a loser.  ...who never stops TALKING!!!  how can his younger brother be so much cooler than him? lol
Trishy says:
i feel bad about that tho
Micah says:
lol i love mr J, and i dislike cellphones...
Micah says:

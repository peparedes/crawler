"event","yep so... everyone and everything just seems to be getting on my nerves lately.. something weird is going on around here. whatever. i've been having mixed feelings lately... like i just want to get the heck out of here already... i cant take it anymore... i almost am ready to just get summer started already so i can work and save up money for my apartment next year and to have money in general and to take my one class and just be busy... but at the same time, i dont think i'm ready to say goodbye to this freedom away from home yet nor am i ready to say goodbye to certain people... summer is going to be diffcult.. that's all i'm saying.. just three more months and i'll be done... it'll go by fast... the rest of the year did... so nothing exciting has been happening.. i really want to go to the fallout boy concert but i dont have the $30 is costs to go... so that sucks... i will go to warped tour this year.. i dont care what it takes.. i'll be there again! school's too easy... family's alright... i dont know... my mind is really messed up lately and i dont know what's going on... maybe it has to do with the fact i almost died last weekend... who knows. i'm kind of rethinking over a lot of things as well.. like marriage.. i dont think i ever want to get married anymore. the idea almost seems silly... spend your entire life devoted to one person. does it end stand true nowadays? i dont know what to think anymore. lately i have been living in the moment... only looking towards the near future... gah, i change my mood and my mind just as often as some changes their socks... i guess i need to stop looking for answers already and just get on living life.. oh how i wish it was summertime already..."

"event","So I feel like a whole new person today. Last night was a real reality check for me but it sucks how it had to happen. But all in all, everything is perfect. Seriously, what was I even thinking? I was being stupid these last couple of days, trying to be a badass and just screwing everything up for no reason at all. I was driving the person closest to me away.. which I kinda of knew that I was doing it but I wasnt stopping my ways until it was almost too late. I am so happy with him... I love being with him...I love everything we've been through and the stuff I've shared with him. If it was up to me, I wouldnt want things any other way.. maybe school and my decisions concerning it and money I would change, but everything else.. not a chance. When I really think about it, I do trust him. That's the biggest thing... I was so worried and coming up with scenarios in my mind that just wouldnt happen and got myself all worked up. I need to stop assuming and deal with whats in front of me... what happened in the past or the stories I've heard about other people have nothing to deal with my life right now. He's nothing like anyone I've met before. He truly cares about me and he what he says he means and is sincere. He really is one of those nice guys every girl dreams of being with. He does so much for me and I really do appreciate it all and maybe sometimes I dont deserve it but I truly am lucky to have him. Granted its only been two months but I've known him for five months now.. and spent practically every single day with him... so its only natural for things to move at a faster pace but I'm ok with it. I realized a lot of things about myself that needs to change. I'm so lucky to be with him but at the same thing I almost ruined everything by protecting myself from getting hurt.. its not something I expect him to do which is why I dont want it to happen. By doing this I've been hurting him with how I treat him and what not. It's coming to an end. I am letting my guard down completely... I am trusting him with everything in me. He's right.. he has earned my trust and hasnt done anything to make me not trust him. I feel horrible for that. I was so close to losing the person the means most to me. That would have been the dumbest mistake ever. Today is a great day... I'm so happy to still be with him...I love him. 


In the meantime, classes are fine. Seems like this semester will be pretty easy... but at the same time, lots of free time still and still no idea of what to major in. I really want this figured out so I can be at easy. I want a good paying job that way depending on where my life takes me I can be fully indepedent if need be and I wont have to rely on my husband or parents for financial support. Something about not working and spending my husbands money just doesnt sit well with me. As much as sitting around and doing nothing does sound nice, it would drive me nuts. I need something that interests me and will keep me busy. What sucks right now is not having a car for 15 days...forces me to rely on others to take me places... I want to go to the store and I need to go to text book outlet which closes at 7... how do we suppose I'm going to get there???? Hmm... 

For a few days there I was depressed about life. I thought there isnt a point and thought no matter what I'm always going to be bored and unhappy. Sure there isnt a point...but I enjoy the stupid little fun moments I share with people... without those I would go crazy. Right now, I'm happy..."

"event","I'm really bored.. Today was my day off from work and I havent done a damn thing. I went shopping earlier but didn't buy anything.. I dont have the shopping gene anymore, it's long gone. So I still have all my money to go shopping later. Being sick sucks as well.. Work tomorrow shall be interesting when I barely have a voice. Chances are I'll lose it half way through my shift tomorrow too. I dont know what to do for New Years... hopefully I come up with some plans soon seeing as how I have a day to decide. I'm not looking that forward to going back to school. 8am class, busy during the day, need to find a job, etc. Hopefully everything works out and not too many things change. I am not a fan of change at all.. that's all for now..."

"event","Ah so I got to see my man last night.. I took the journey out to Bloomfield.. I was nervous about the drive but I did alright and didn't get lost.. I'm proud of myself! I had fun last night.. I always have fun with him. I just love cuddling up next to him... it doesnt matter whats going on, I just love the feeling! He makes me so happy! And let me say this, I am a kick ass guesser when it comes to pictionary.. lol So I couldve tried harder and actually played but maybe another time. I ventured back home around 5 am... lol I'm lucky there was no one else on the roads because if I dont know where I am and how to get back then I'm a horrible driver.. lol It's kinda funny to see I suppose.. but I didnt get lost at all on the way back..

Then I got four hours of sleep before heading into work... Kinda boring. Nothing was really happening.. I do have to say Andrew and I have never talked this much ever.. its still not much but it's progress. He's a cool guy.. I love my work people.. I missed that place. I'm kinda annoyed working there though but I wont be back til summer time, so it's ok. I'll love the paychecks I'll be getting, so it's cool with me. I got to go home early and I slept all day pretty much...  

I get to party Monday night!!! That night I hope is tons of fun!!!!!! I cant wait... party with my friends oh yeah! lol 



MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!"

"event","SOOOOO... Being in Lapeer sucks! lol I still have two weeks left here.. I honestly dont know if I'll make it out alive or not! We'll see. I have to work for the next ten days without a day off and then when I go back I have to work open to close.. yippie! It'll be a nice paycheck, so its all worth it. I've already ran into some old friends.. ah I miss these people, somewhat. I feel like such an outsider being here at home because I spend all my time cooped up in my house.. probably because no one cared enough to keep in touch with me after all I've done for them and what not.. so now I literally have no one or they are just too busy... I love how people are still fake after all this time but whatever. I go back to OU in two weeks and I am going to make more of an effort when I go back with everyone! That's why I'm there and hopefully when I come home for summer things begin to look up for me.. I can just hope! 

So yeah, I'm blasting music and dancing around the house.. it's fun to just let go! I haven't been able to do this in awhile...  being in the dorms and all.. that'd just be embarrassing! haha... I do have laundry to tend to before going to work later on tonight, but being here makes me lazy.. lol It's not like I have to get on the elevator to take care of it and everything, oh well.. I'll get around to it when I'm done letting loose! haha 


Ever notice how christmas shopping brings out another side to a person? Pay attention, because believe me it does.. And never go shopping when cranky! I don't recommend it.. lol  Someone plz call me over break!!!"

"event","So I'm here at home... for the next two weeks.. I'm going to be so busy at work! I work a combined total of close to 80 hours.. I'm bringing in the dough~ yes! I need it though.. but those open to close shifts are going kill me and drain me out.. I'm so happy that I have New Years Eve off! I get to partay! Mmm.. work was so slow today.. no one came and it was weird with it being me, Melissa, Andrew, and Danielle.. old times. I even got to see Ash and Hannah. Lots of people I havent seen in some time. I did however get three checks... made my day, only the bank was closed because of the weather.. schools are closed for tomorrow.. busy day tomorrow, yay! BUT I get to see my hunny tomorrow night possibly. I cant stand being away from him.. whenever I come home it seems as though Im living two seperate lives.. one here and one at OU. I really like him... I was being such a baby today and tearing up at the thought of coming home.. sure an hour is nothing but still. I told him that we are moving into together at some point... I really hope we last... I believe we could and will. I wont let anything happen or get in the way of him and I. Ah... so I come home today and my room is all re-arranged.. something new.. lol Other than that, theres nothing going on here. Its quite sad if I must say... People need to call me over break... I want to be around my friends and everything..."

"event","Gah.. I'm almost done with this damn rhetoric paper. The last one and I am completely bs-ing my way through it.. I love it! But can you believe this.. it's fricken noon and people are still sleeping which is forcing me to not be able to do anything at all in this room. I hate having to be absolutely quiet for the sake of other people... esp when I dont always get the same treatment, but what can you do? It's been happening to me for years.. I always go out of my way to please people and see them happy and get NOTHING in return and after all that I still do things for others... I've been told MANY times that I am just too nice. Only when I want to be and if I choose to be nice to them.     So this week and next we start finals.. How exciting.. I really need to buckle down and study.. I need to ace all of these to get my GPA up. I have so much shit to do for all of them though... Like for philosophy study for 100 questions and then write 2 300 word essays! Psych we have two exams at once! and I dont even know yet for French. Chances are though I wont be able to study.....   I'm not looking forward to Christmas break either.. Go home and suffer for three weeks of doing nothing at all! Well I will be working but thrown back into the uneeded drama... possibly hang out with some friends that I have been meaning to see... and possibly party!! ... Ah I cannot wait for the party part..Hopefully something exciting happens for New Years as well.. I'm trying to get that night off so I can be with my hunny but we'll see.....  On a side note.. I think my mother is ignoring my emails.. Granted I'm old enough to do whatever I choose I still feel as though I need her permission on certain things. Hmmmm...."

"event","So today was rather stressful...or I kinda made it more than it needed to be. I stayed up til 5 am last night (because thats what OU has trained me to do.. lol) and wanted to get up at 10.. nope.. try noon or so... I had work at 3.. well I decide to try on pants thinking the ones I had in my room would fit... None of the khaki pants in this house would fit me! Not even the old ones.. not like I could wear them anyways cuz they're all dirty but still! So I was freaking out.. I hurried up got ready and headed to the store.. I had to buy new pants and shoes.. and then run off to work!.. Whoo.. I am so hitting up the rec when I get back to OU! 

Work was ok.. not much has changed around there.. The new kids were confused by me.. I came in and owned the place.. lol Carol was glad to have me back.. and Amber came in and hugged me.. Oh how I've missed her! Later on, Meredith came in... my old crew~ Well, only half.. I have yet to see the rest.. That ticket room was so cold.. brr! It was steady and all in all, I came home early.. hahaha!! 

So Amber kept asking me about Chris today.. She thinks its so cute.. She had rhetoric with him last year, so she kinda knows him... but I got asked all the famous questions.. how long have you been together?.. where does he live?? have you met the family??? do you see it lasting??? does he treat you good??? And then .. dun dun dun.. 'He does remind me of Ryan'... Ok yes in some ways he is like him, but once you get to know him as well as I do... the more he isnt like him... Ryan is old news.. I've finally learned to let go of him and the past... so I think everyone else needs to give it a rest.... Besides, thats the last thing I need... a comparision between the two.. Nope... 

So now on to PIE!!! muahahahaha!"

"event","Today was a very weird day.. I dont know what it was, but there was just a weird vibe all around.. I woke up today with my special someone next to me, and things went the way they usually do..went to lunch in the cafe.. complained about the horrible food and the music.. although Santa Baby came on!! haha... another time. then i studied for my french exam, but spent my time watching boy meets world (the daily routine).. chris drove me to class... such a sweetie! of course, had to have our first official snowball fight.. i'm not going to waste the first day of snow w/o one!!!! haha class.. eh.. waste of time! then i got picked up.. had to pack and clean up the room and spend one more hour with my honey before leaving for home... just had a weird vibe! 

The roads and traffic sucked! I hate those idiots that no matter what decide to drive as fast as possible and those who ride your bumper the whole way... I slammed on my brakes.. yeah, they stayed away from me after that one! serves them right... took me over an hour and a half to get home.. 

I'm home now... I just do not miss this place.. It almost depresses me being home because I'm not coming back to see anyone.. I wish I could see my friends but I was never really all that close with most of them.. I was closest with my co-workers, not the kids from high school. So while everyone else I know is out and about catching up with old friends.. I'm here, sitting at home, with nothing to do. Maybe it's my fault though for all this.. Yep, I think it is. Just like I am realizing now that I need to change somethings when I go back to OU.. I need to really break out of my shell and get out there and make the effort to be close with the friends I have there... so far, I havent really done much.. Like I said on myspace, I am jealous of other people and their lives.. For a little while now, I've been living life from the sidelines, watching other people go out there and enjoy life and are happy.. That's what I need to be doing... I really miss my best friend... Nicki and I havent seen each other since my open house.. we dont email each other that much.. she called last weekend... a great surprise! It sucks though that things wont ever be the same... but what can you do? Well, time to watch some TV or possibly catch up on my homework in hopes that I fall asleep to prepare for my big day at work tomorrow!!!!  Happy Turkey Day!"

"event","So last night around here was pretty boring. No one was here.. everyone was up at State or for some unknown reason went home for the weekend. I spent my first weekend here at OU and my gosh, what a waste of days! lol Friday night my crew was here but we couldn't find anything to do. Well a bunch of us went over to the Village to go shopping, then Brit, her sister Erika, Kev, and I all went out to eat at Applebees.. got back and then everyone split up.. my friends were having a party but drank everything wayy quickly.. Not fair. lol Then the girls were gonna go to the Mardi Gras party.. then changed their minds and went over to the apartments.. Eventually the rest of us followed.. then Jordan, Erika, and I made a TBell run.. came back here and watched a movie. How exciting?! Yesterday everyone was gone.. and my parents were in the area so I tagged along with them and went out to lunch with them. It was nice. They are gonna get me a new laptop because this one is a freakin piece.. lol And I told them I'd make them a list so they can send me a care package.. haha Im poor and can't afford anything! Yeah so last night, I stayed in again and watched another movie. Today everyone's gone til later tonight, so I'm stuck here ... I'll prolly clean or study or maybe I'll go somewhere.. who knows...

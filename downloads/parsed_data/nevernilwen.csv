"event","I'm still feeling depressed and there are a lot of reasons for that. A couple of people know it and giving me advice but I don't feel any better. I think I want things that I never can make true. It feels like climbing a ladder and with every step I take up I'll fall 3 down. With other words very depressed again.
Everything works out great for a couple of weeks and then it goes wrong. I don't know why what goes wrong but I have the feeling that I wanna do a lot of things at the same time. And I'm worried about things that doesn't matter that much.
And my body is doing weird things that I don't understand, tired the whole time, shaking hands, weird moods - in 1 day from depressed to happy-. So I'll see the doctor next week and I'll hope he know what's really wrong with me..

bye bye"

"event","bleghh that's all I have to say today. I'm a little sick and that sucks. I'm tired the whole time and even sleeping doesn't help.
And it takes a long time to get better said my doctor so someone please cheer me up.
I'm really depressed right now even my boyfriend doesn't have time for me or doesn't want to make time for me. Am I that horrible to spent time with???? I'm always there for people and now when I need someone nobody is there for me. So I decided to let people down when they need me that's a fair decision

So please make me smile :-) again"

"event","well here a new happy message from me. On my work it's getting worser and worser. I have a good feeling about the work that I do but It's just that it's doesn't click between my and my boss. I can't do anything right and the way it's told to me is not correct - inhuman-.
So I'm getting an new education program and I hope that I'll find what I really want to do.
First I'll start to choose what's the best for me and also look at the costs.
Maybe I'll go into the office business of I'll join the Royal navy of something else
Hmm the navy sounds the best thing that I can do.It always attracted me 

I'll see it later...

"event","I've been thinking a lot lately. Also about things where I shouldn't be thinking of like for example my job. Is this what I really want to do? Am I happy on the moment? Can I handle more things? It's driving me crazy. I'm feeling like I'm in the wrong places in the wrong times. Sometimes I wish I could take a plain an leave everything for what it is and forgot everything.
My boyfriend is one of the thing that I appreciate and I'm really happy when he is around cause I can be myself. Then I don't have to 'act' and pretend that I'm someone else.
But my mom doesn't like him - I don't care- she can only talk bad things  about him.. Maybe she needs to know him better - idea- or maybe ....
I'm out of good ideas. Like I said I'll take a plane to far far away and then is everyone happy..

Till the next time
 Lots of love"

"event","This week was a hell. It all started on my work, something dissapeared and they blamed me for it. I can't help it when someone else under my supervision can't watch one simple thing. But when things doesn't work out the way you wanted it then you get stronger and more motivated to make it go your way.
So from this moment I'll grow a little bit and I'm gonna be a tough one (also know as a bitch). I think I'll scare people but I don't care about all the others anymore. Cause when I need help nobody will be there or me..
So I have no idea what to do with all the things right know but I'll fall into the right place after a while..
Thk God that I have a boyfriend who is supercute and that fixes everything...

My boyfriend sends me really sweet text messages and that makes me feel better.
Some people blaming me for being sick, I didn't ask for it. And they think that it isn't that bad but it is really bad. I hate it when people traet me like this but my time will come..

Over 2 months I'm going on vacation to Mallorca with my best friend and I'm really looking forward to it. Finaly some rest and be far away of everyone - parents-.
Maybe I'll meet a very rich man there and.. oops I'm already taken by someone hehehe.

My week started f*cked but it all turned out great.. I went out with a boy who likes me - It was fun but that's it. 
He is not my kind of guy and I don't wanna give him false hope. But that's really my problem with men, they like me but I don't like them :-S and I have to let them know that I don't like them.. Hmm I'm attracting the wrong men to me - I should do something about that :-)

Let's talk about the weather, we have snow. When the first snowflakes fell I wanted to run outside and make a snowman but I realized that there wasn't that much snow.. I want SNOW a lot of SNOW that we can't get out of our houses and that we don't have to work. That would be wonderfull.
Well, I need to clean up my messy room so I'm off now..

So I think that the world hates me and that nobody notices me. I did ( and doing) a lot of good things but everyone is always trying to only look at the bad things- some people always try to cut your legs away...
Well, they say: you fall to get up again and you make mistakes to learn so I'll try to look at a bright site. Wich is sometimes really hard when nobody supports you. I have a lot of friends but sometimes you just need someone who you can cry with and who supports you when needed..
So I'm gonna to take a shower- wash the bad thing away....

I'm feeling much better than last week, the doctor gave me something and that is working. The only not fun thing is that I had a date tonight and I can't go.I'm feeling terrible about that so I sended the boy an e-mail and he wrote back that it isn't bad that we can't go tonight and that I have to get better.
Soo sweet...
Tomorrow I'll have to fix some x-mas cards together and make a candle for my nail-stylist. Maybe for my boss but this year I only give cards to people I really care about, last year I gave everyone a card and let's say 50% of that people didn't gave me a card back.(^$$#^@&*#^&@({=*&)!&&@%^#><) So that feels better. 
So remember If you would like to recieve a card from me you have to send me one back = )

I got my new car last week, very happy now and I can drive alone YAY.. 
Really weird to be alone, you have to find your own way. But I love my car 
and it looks so cute. 

On my work it's going the normal way. Today it was very (&&^%&*&#%^&$#*)all the people were complaining to me about things that aren't my department. Blegghh. 
But after a while you know to ignore that - if you take those things personal you're gonna get nuts.

And the boy who is in love with me stopped bothering me

Further, nothing happened here.. Kinda boring. 
Anyways.On my work was it funny . My boss is really cool the only weird thing is that he always talks about sex. The conversations starting with normal subjects and somehow he always know how to change the subject.. This is most of the time funny but sometimes you just don't wanna hear it..
Tonight I finally can watch desperate housewifes, I always tried to watch but I forgot and now I'm gonna try it again..

Today I went shopping. I think that shopping is really a women thing. You can entertain yourself for a superlong time and you always have fun even when you went alone.
I just did a happy dance becuase next week I'm getting my nails back.. yippie and I'm still dancing.
And I have next week my drivers license exam, I'm a little nervous but I trust myself that I can control everything. even the nervs...

Today it wasn't a great day at work but everyone has these days. I went shopping - the best way to entertain yourself - and I bought some usefull stuff.. No shoes (I'm addictive to shoes) so I think I'm sick. My mom always asks : Did you bought anything? And when  say no she asks: No shoes? You're sick  Funny thing...
But what to day with the guy who is in love with me? I think that I'm gonna be not so nice for him - I don't like him that way. Well he should get over it, there are worser things in life. 
So, I'm going now have to clean my room (messy right now)..

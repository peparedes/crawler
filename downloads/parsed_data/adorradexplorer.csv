"event","<br /><br />Oh hai, looks like I am back in this space but no no, I guess before LJ or anyother LJ communities kick me out in their community because of the long no-updates-this-livejournal-is-pronounced-dead... I should just type something.<br /><br />I had migraine this afternoon like after eons of not having one, it came back with vengeance. Thankfully, it wasn't a bad one.<br /><br />I took the meds, oh, Doc gave me anarex - same old medicine which till now hasn't brought any cure to the incessant major epicbitch headache I have been having for the last 100 years. Yes, if you still don't know, I am past a century years old. He also gave me some lozenges for my sore throat which have seemed to numb my tastebuds. How nice.<br /><br />Anyways, my point of writing in here is for the other half to read this message I am leaving for her.<br /><br />Here it goes,<br /><br />Hey you,<br /><br />After you called, life seems so much better. Like I have always said, you are the cure to all my heartaches and I was so glad to hear your voice even in my most sodding sedated tired state. Though I was in pain and it was raining the whole time and I wished you were by my side, I think I am still very thankful for your call. So thank you. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Ickle asked me today what I am thankful for, I am thankful for a heart that is still beating, loving you and forgiving people who did wrong to me and a heart that still holds you inside.<br /><br />I was listening to my iTunes and this song came - If It Kills Me by Jason Mraz. Pretty much sums up what really is inside this heart.<br /><div style=""text-align: center; "">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ljembed"" style=""text-align: center; ""><lj-embed id=""43""/></div><br /><br />Hello, tell me you know <br />That you've figured me out <br />Something gave it away <br />And it would be such a beautiful moment <br />To see the look on your face <br />To know that I know that you know now <br /><br />And baby that's a case of my wishful thinking <br />You know nothing <br />'Cause you and I, we go carrying on for hours on and <br />We get along much better than you and your boyfriend <br /><br />Well all I really want to do is love you <br />A kind much closer than friends use <br />But I still cant say it after all we've been through <br />And all I really want from you is to feel me <br />As the feeling inside keeps building <br />And I will find a way to you if it kills me, <br />If it kills me <br /><br />How long can I go on like this <br />Wishing to kiss you <br />Before I rightly explode <br />And this double life I lead isn't healthy for me <br />In fact it makes me nervous <br />If I get caught I could be risking it all <br />Maybe theres a lot that I miss <br />In case I'm wrong <br /><br />All I really want to do is love you <br />A kind much closer than friends use <br />But I still cant say it after all we've been through <br />And all I really want from you is to feel me <br />As the feeling inside keeps building <br />And I will find a way to you if it kills me, <br />If it kills me <br /><br />If I should be so bold <br />I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand <br />Tell you from the start how I've longed to be your man <br />But I never said a word I guess I'm gonna miss my chance again <br /><br /><strong><em>Well all I really want to do is love you <br />A kind much closer than friends use <br />But I still can't say it after all we've been through <br />And all I really want from you is to feel me <br />As the feeling inside keeps building <br />And I will find a way to you if it kills me, <br />If it kills me </em></strong><br /><br />I think it might kill me <br /><br />And all I really want from you is to feel me <br />As the feeling inside keeps building <br />And I will find a way to you if it kills me, <br />If it kills me <br /><br />It might kill me."

Now, let's see this poster. Oh, by the way, this was taken from the movie poster which stars Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and Other Drugs. I bet by now, you do realise that I took only a portion of the poster and focused on the quote which was plastered on it right?&nbsp;<br /><br />Heh.<br /><br />Those words there, they strike some chord in me although I must admit that when I first saw it, I couldn't help but to snigger and thought to myself - how cheesy can this get? Hahaha! But, as I mull over it and thought it through, I kinda concluded that it is one of the many cheesy truths about life and love too.<br /><br />It is such a familiar quote yes? Many couples would have probably came across this like at least once in their life - falling in love with someone they least expect to and then realise that they need the other party rather than just wanting them.<br /><br />If you ask me, I sure have my fair share of it. And looking at me and my half's love story, it is definitely the epitome of our love story.<br /><br />Never thought I would have given her my heart or even fell so deeply in love with such an amazing person and eventually, became the one person I need the most. It is amusing yet to me it is heartwarming - to be in love with someone I least expected to and then realising, she is the one I need in my life, the same person who completes me and my life.<br /><br />In other news, I am looking forward to watch the movie when it opens at the box office next year which is also in a few days time which then leads me to the next somewhat related news...<br /><br />I am in deep trouble aren't I?&nbsp;<br /><br />I should be bracing up for the worst as 2011 approaches and yet, I am falling deep... so into deep.<br /><br />So yes, the above quotes are horribly mad cheesy but let's face it, it is also one of the many corny truths about life and love. ;)<br /><br />What say you?</div>"

"event","<br />It was a crazy Christmas, believe me.<br /><br />Lots of running and eating, being merry, joymaking, gifts exchanging and a whole lot of getting together.<br /><br />It was a mad decision but all worth it, to fly back home and spend Christmas together with my other half - this was a 50-50 plan which may or may not work out. Hell, I take risks in life and this was one of the risk I took which I will never regret.<br /><br />Got back home at 4 in the afternoon and my oh my, the weather was so fine (yes, this was before the whole storm that reigned the dark night skies which obviously then illuminated the usual black skies).<br /><br />Decided to ring the other half to check where she was and only to find out she already had plans for the evening. Oh, what a bummer, there goes my Santarina surprise.<br /><br />Well, Santarina still have to deliver the presents right on time right even if the weather was horribly crazy with the pouring rain and lightning storm everywhere like as if the mighty powers above were having some war and fighting it all out using their awesomeshit light sabers. Yes, so in the end, with the help of the efficient MRT, Santarina decided to not risk her reindeers from being struck down by lightnings and took the train instead.<br /><br /><p>She arrived at her half's place thankfully dry and rather flustered and irritated by the stupid humid Singapore's rain bring along without fail like every Goddarn time it pours. Half was very surprised to see Santarina it seems. Perhaps, she was amused by the fact that I still look good or bothered to dress up and equipped with my Santarina hat despite the crazy weather and how late it was.<br /><br />Well, I was greeted with a pleasant surprise. Smooth jazzy tunes was playing in the background, lights were dimmed only with candles illuminating my half's madly gorgeous place and ahhh, what is Christmas without the Christmas tree right? There it was, standing colourfully with the red, blue, green, golden lights wrapping its delicate leaves.<br /><br />My oh my, I was obviously slowly floating up, up and away by what was in front of me.<br /><br />A sweet candle lit dinner. /heaven<br /><br />We settled down, placed my coat aside and sat down. We ate, we drank to our heart's content, we reminisced, we enjoyed each other's company and totally basked in each other's presence.<br /><br />Came gift exchanging time for the both of us and I surprised her with the diary she has been wishing for and coupled with a sweet Christmas card, written a heartfelt note too plus a box of Royce' delish Champagne flavoured chocolate. She was bemused because she got me the same thing too - the chocolate from Royce part that is. Heee. :p Inside the bag of gift she had for me was a pair of earrings and necklace which she told me to choose. I decided on the earrings because they were just so dainty and elegant. :)<br /><br />We retreated to another space of her house where the real surprise began. I was looking around and she pointed to a parcel wrapped in a candy like in pink and white. Cute, I must say. I was instructed to take it and have a look. Lol. It didn't make sense cos' obviously, it was hers since it was in her space but she 'forced' me to open it for her. Weird, I know. So, I took the honour of unwrapping 'her' present and only to find out that the parcel was FROM her and addressed TO her. Fishy. Very, weird and fishy.<br /><br />So, I unwrapped the present and unboxed what was inside. My heart stopped when I saw the packaging. I gulped and paused for a second to carefully inspect the white packaging. OMG. IT&nbsp;WAS&nbsp;AN&nbsp;APPLE&nbsp;BOX&nbsp;AND&nbsp;IT&nbsp;SCREAMED&nbsp;ITOUCH AT&nbsp;MEEEEE. Omg. This is going to sound stupid but I honestly thought she got an iTouch 4 for Christmas and I was so dead envious. HAHAHAHAH. (well, it was on my wishlist :P)<br /><br />So, I unboxed it and to my pleasant horror suprise, there was an engraving at the back and it had my name on it! <br /><br />Now, that was when it all hit me... the iTouch WAS FOR ME.<br /><br />OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG. MY HALF GOT ME THE ITOUCH4 WHICH I HAVE BEEN EYEING ON FOR SOOO LIKE 45678906545MILLIONYEARS LONG. /runs around the house.<br /><br />I was so elated no no, the right word should be euphoric. It was like all the good chemicals in my body just increased like a million fold. I was so happy. Yeah, mad endorphins reproduction on Christmas.<br /><br />Gahhh, I love my dear half. &lt;3<br /><br />Heee. Yes, I am incredibly happy that my wish came true and it was my half who granted it but honestly, what made my Christmas was the fact that the&nbsp;both of us got to be near each other for Christmas this year even though it was a short one. Truth to be told, nothing beats spending Christmas with your dearly beloved ones right?<br /><br />So, thank you, my half, my heart. :)<br /><br />p/s: We named it Stefan, yes... because I loveeee Stefan Salvatore from Vampire Diaries. :p</p><br />"

It is the 'nua' period where the holiday mood sinks in and yours truly is just too downright lazy to do anything. I mean, really anything. <br /><br />Well, spreading some good love is excluded. *winks<br /><br />Just the other night, my half asked me what do I want for Christmas? I think she has been asking me the same question like a million times now and I still could not give a definitive answer. Partly because I have tonnes of tech gadgets which honestly cost a bomb like in total or even just one and and what I really want for Christmas... well... I think it is just impossible and unattainable even if I have been really good this year. *Santa, please take cue from me to nod with that statement.*<br /><br />Yes, truth to be told is that I just want my other half to be with me for as long as this life takes me or rather, us.<br /><br />Is that too much to ask for?<br /><br />I guess it is because the odds are against us (me) and such wish is just too hard to be granted. *sobs<br /><br />Well, since I have not posted my Christmas list for this year and if any of you are still cracking your brains on what to get me... here are some of the things you can get me. Pardon the price (well, just ignore some for they are just a part of my VERY wishful thinking).<br /><br />1. iTouch 4 8GB<br />2.&nbsp;Moleskine (red) Daily planner /Sheila, you got it all covered for this right?

"event","While battling with unsettled and raging emotions from tolerating a bunch of annoying youths acting stupid in the train, disturbing my for-once-peaceful train ride home and and on top of that, figuring out why the heart was aching so badly - both physically and metaphorically well, having said that, let's just take it as literally... I was spacing out, drfiting in and out of reality with 1001 things running in my head.<br /><br />And while all of that was happening, little did I know that my face began to turn red and so did my eyes. Then came the tears welling up, filling up the red eyes of mine. Initially, I&nbsp;attributed it to dust or lack of sleep I have been getting these days but obviously, it was a result of something else. Perhaps, something more deeper than that.<br /><br />I was freaking out inside knowing that I was still outside, still in the view of public, strangers I have never met or spoke to before and there I was heading for some breakdown. I kept looking up to make the tears run back inside to where it was supposed to be until I reach home. I was greeted with white almost blinding lights which hurt my eyes even more after minutes of staring at it. My head seemed to have its own conversation going on inside. It was weird when I could hear myself talking (or rather, the head) with the music blasting away from my phone.<br /><br /><p>The word control popped too many a times. It made me ponder for a while if I am actually losing control of my life or was there even a time that I was totally in full control of my life. And if I was, why does it feel that I am beginning to lose control of my life at even the slightest things like my emotions and in this case, tears. Have I totally gone soft from growing up after being hit by countless and not to mention endless of heartbreaks and shit life brings? Why did the tears kept clogging my eyes and made me feel like I was on the right path to a massive breakdown?<br /><br />So many questions yet it was always replied with a painful uncertain silence.<br /><br />The heart still hurts like it was pierced through with a knife and then got ripped apart. I guess, at the end of the day, nothing kills more than just words.<br /><br /><br />But, on a hindsight, I should be thankful or feel relieved that perhaps in this life, we are just meant to be friends&nbsp;(and with that, we are not putting each other in a state where we are comitting a sin)&nbsp;and nothing more than that and you are accepting it&nbsp; well. And, it is about time that I should come to terms with it.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />Another night, another battle to sleep, another lonely aching heart, another night of crying to sleep.</p>Guten nacht."

I will reiterate this to you.

Answering to your question in the bus earlier before you left,

you: heh, you still care?

Of course I do and I&nbsp;will always do.

Even at my worst or best, pms or normal day, or you drive me nuts or even my early grave or break my heart into million pieces (with mentions of goodbyes and those things you very well know that I hate to hear), I still care for you and will still care for you. This is because I love you and nothing will change that. Take heart in that and remember this well.

I had the longest sleep ever for the week and woke up tragically not feeling like P.Diddy but with a sodding bad backache and mixed haywired emotions. Let me see what caused such occurence especially on a hot and fine Sunday late morning. Jeez.&nbsp;I shall not even point out the obvious.

I had a museum date for the longest time also yesterday. I went to National Museum to catch Pompeii exhibition courtesy of V who shared with me some invites and then off to Peranakan Museum for the Nth time to go back to my roots and relish in the fact that I have an awesome kickass culture. Hahaha. Yea, I am proud of my origins like that. It was a good date in all. 

Started with a drink from Starbucks (cues you to say HELLO DARK CHERRY MOCHA WOOHWEEHH!) then in between was all time favourite Marigold's Neapolitan ice cream in a cup. You know like the good ol' young and innocent days where Neapolitan ice cream in a cup was a hit amongst parents because it is worth every penny in the pocket. Three awesome flavours in a cup and for a dollar or was it lesser? What more can you ask for? Then followed by dinner at Bakerzin at Suntec. I think I haven't dine at the outlet for like many many moons already because they had a change in their menu and I was caught clueless not knowing what to order or do next. Well, thank God for the awesome manager then. Ha! We ended the date with a trip to Haagen Dazs and had a try at their Christmas menu. Good time, goot Saturday in all. Not counting how it ended but shit happens so let's just shut it.

Head is telling me to give up completely. 
Heart is telling me to just shut down completely.
I think it is one of those days where I wished my life is simple and not complicated as fuck and I don't have like 999 shit to think about and the other bitches ain't got one.

I shall go seek some refuge and solace in Death Cab For Cutie and remind myself how the heart is an empty room and someday I will be loved and then I will follow you into dark.

Till then my babies, stay gold and let sparks fly."

I feel damn lethargic now after crashing at some ungodly hour looking for hotels/inns/villas for 2 night stay at Bali under $100per night AND waiting for her to call me which eventually led me to falling asleep on my bed with two techtocks - bb's lapster and Aury, my Samsung phone right beside my ear. Thus, when the alarm rang this morning at 6am, I got the supriseshock of my life - my soul might have got jolted out of my body for a second or two.

But for now, since Suria is showing some annoying show and the peepos are not here, I might just go catch another 40 winks before the long long night arrives.

The experience of living through the darkest yet sodding sad period of my life and emerged from&nbsp;it beaming with happiness&nbsp;was something I could very well identify with this song. Ah, it was love, unintended love.<br /><br />Now, when I listen to this song, I feel a wave of helplessness. Ironic. It was this song that pulled me away and out from sinking deeper into the abyss of sadness. However, at this very moment, I feel like I am being reeled in deeper and further inside this dark and depressing hole to nowhere by an unseen force. Or, there are moments where I feel like I am in a trance like mode and I am floating aimlessly towwards it.&nbsp;Scary? You tell me. <br /><br />But, I guess this is happening because &quot;you could be my unintended&quot; is not happening this time round which is also probably explains why the once &quot;trick&quot; backfired<br /><br />Right, so when it backfires, I have to scurry around and find a new way to get out or at least try to not suddenly go into trance like mode and without realising float into the hole. So, I try my usual hair therapy in hopes of feeling better, well if not slightly should suffice, for the night. Hahaha!<br /><br />Steven wasn't around thus Adam took over my hair today. Adam was perplexed and I must say rather amused when he found out why I was back in Twister this evening. Well, he did try to give me some words of comfort in the most blatant-deal-with-it way whilst he painstakingly showered my hair with love and patience. In his words, &quot;shit happens right? life goes on.&quot; <br /><br />Indeed so and so did a few inches of my hair. I got him to trim the ends of my utterly damaged poor hair which I believe hot only has accumulated all the disappointment and heartache for the past months (especially past one month) but also all the rubbish chemicals I have been lathering my hair with.<br /><br />I look like this now...</p><p style=""text-align: center""><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v74/azyma/snapshot-1.jpg"" /></p><p style=""text-align: center"">Pardon moi.

Don't I look decently awesome with my right-after-saloon-hair? I bet tomorrow it will look horribly ugly again. <br /><br />With that, I end this entry with a liner from the song in this post.<br /><br /><em>&quot;You could be the one who listens to my deepest inquisitions.&quot;<br /></em><br />Guten nacht babies!"

"event","<p>Despite being down with a tummy upset which later escalated to fever yesterday, I managed to feel better overnight and proceeded on with my breakfast date with Adele at Dempsey. We went to Jones the Grocer. :D Hahaha, like finally. <br /><br />We were supposed to meet for Mambo Night I know but we have decided to be normal people for once and not meet over dancing to glorified old hits. HAHAHAHA. But, I am sure we will do it soon. :p<br /><br />Breakfast was good, so good in fact. I love Jones the Grocer, I really adore the place. The food is a little pricey but well, once in a while shouldn't hurt the pocket so much. All good things after all should have them moderately. Seesh. Totally dig the environment there and being surrounded with fresh grocery while enjoying my breakfast. I could totally make use of the&nbsp;items there and go for my unusual floating down the isles of fresh groceries.<br /><br />So anyways, it was a good catch up and fill me in with your life time for the both of us since we have been away from each other for years, months, weeks and days. We obviously had tonnes to talk about and we could jolly well write a biography of our lives for each other to read. Adele let me into her school life, juicy bits of her personal life which&nbsp;I ain't gonna say about it here but I think I should just fly to overseas to like get away from it all and restart my life - all aspect of my life there. Gosh, the escapist in me sure like the thought of it.<br /><br />We had our all time heart to heart talk and I really missed that. Adele is prolly one of the few people who I know I can have a truly honest heart to heart talk to the point that I usually shed a tear or two either in frustration or disappointment or anger in between or at the end. I think this time round it was like all 3 of the above. I was telling her how frustrated and pressurised I am lately because someone been telling/asking me to find a boyfriend? Like &quot;when are you going to get a boyfriend?&quot; I was like telling Adele...<br /><br /><em>&quot;babe, if only finding a boyfriend is like taking&nbsp;a stroll down these isles of fresh groceries and I pick one that looks good, tastes good and well, good overall. But, what the hell? Life don't work out that way and so is my heart. Urgh. /bangs the table in frustration.&quot;<br /></em><br />I think Adele got a shock when I banged the table and then I started tearing up. Emotional basket queen to the max lah but you know I think with yesterday's fever and diarhhea and then talking about matters of the heart, my emotions do get haywire a bit.<br /><br />And with Adele being Adele, she totally made things right with her wise words and reassurance that things will turn better eventually. Oh, it also helps that we shared a delish cup of tea. Hahaha!<br /><br />Well, Adele said almost the same thing what someone told me over the phone yesterday. She said no point rushing to find a boyfriend or a replacement to fill in the sudden hole/gap in the heart more so when the heart is not ready yet. It is because I will end up with tonnes and tonnes of rebound relationships and more shit and heartache will follow suit. I honestly think I was just being plain lucky that the supposed rebound relationship I had with J turned out pretty well but I can't say the same for the rest. Hur. Oh, Adele told me not to feel pressurised already because it is pointless. There is nothing much I can do if the heart is not ready for a new one. Yeah sure, options are kept open but when the time and the next one comes and the heart is ready, of course... the hole/gap is ready to be filled in but till then, such things shouldn't be rushed. Like they say, matters of the hearts should never be rushed even if sometimes, my head often tries to tell me... if only, your heart can move onto someone new in 24 hours time or I sooo cannot wait to get over this failed relationship and start anew.<br /><br />I had a really good breakfast and I think my heart doesn't feel that heavy now. My heart feels free in fact, totally unchained from the frustration and pressure it has been going through lately to move on and find someone new. Yippeee yay!&nbsp;:)<br /><br />Alright, enjoy the rest of the weekend babies! stay gold and awesome!<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","I have always loved walking with you even at the darkest alleys and at the latest hour of the night. You make me feel safe. Whenever I start fearing for my life, for some reason, I know where I can find your hands for me to hold onto. Thanks for holding on. Thanks for not letting go.

Last two evenings was just great. Thanks for being there. (:"

"event","Day 5.

I was walking home from work earlier and I looked up to the sky and I was greeted with a crescent moon shining so brightly at me. I felt warm yet a sudden rush of emptiness appeared. Something was definitely missing. 

It wasn't something, it was someone.

It was you.

My moon, my he(a)rt, when I saw the crescent moon shining at me, I remember the times when we walked home together, you beside me. It felt so complete. I miss those times, I miss those nights, I miss being close to you, I miss walking side by side with you, I miss you.

My moon, my one and only moon."

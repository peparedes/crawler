"event","I'm in Gander right now at the Comfort Inn. Woo for free wireless internet. We had a game against Bonavista last night and we beat them 6-0! Another shutout for me.. and I got player of the game. Which is so cool because I've never been the best player in a game. I so got free fries and a puck. We've got two more games today against Fogo and Botwood and we should be able to beat them. Then championships tomorrow.. hopefully another gold medal. hopefullyyyy."

"event","So much for getting back into the habit of posting regularly.... One month later. I generally never bother with livejournal anymore, except to read the posts of a select few.. make sure people haven't vanished off the face of the earth. I really just don't have time to waste anymore.<br /><br />Well, on the off-chance that anyone is interested in whats going on in my life, then perhaps this post will fulfill those interests. Or perhaps not. It goes like this: always busy.. cadets, brownies, work, school, girl, and more hockey that I could ever dream of (although, still not enough!) and never enough 'sit-on-ass-and-do-nothing' time.<br /><br />""Hey simplicity! Where'd you go?!""<br /><br />I sent my MUN application off last week. That scares the shit out of me. Really. It's almost Christmas already. My last year of high school&nbsp;is almost&nbsp;half finished. In 6 months I'll be looking for an apartment... for good this time. It's the rest of my life and lately I don't feel too great about it. I'm going to be such a party animal next year. Oh well, Robyn and I will had a grand ol' time.<br /><br />I think I have icicles hanging from my nose."

"event","<p>Wow. It's been almost three months. Time sure does go fast when you're having fun. Perhaps I'll get back into the groove and start writing about my oh so interesting life again. I can only suspect that Erin would be&nbsp;all I'd ever want to write about.. and that's really not cool. It's very homo of me.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm dressing up as gum under a shoe.

We'd all be so much better off without the drama.<br /><br />Tegan and Sara makes me think of all the lying in bed and crying I did last summer. I can't even listen to them anymore without getting that heavy feeling in my stomach. I forget what its like to be estatic. I've forgotten what it feels like to be in love. I want it back.

"event","I change journals too often.

St. John's for 5 days. It was a nice change. I got away from work, and met a few really neat, insanely smart&nbsp;people. The math seminar was absolutely amazing. The problems were so effing hard, but the atmosphere will make for good motivation in the future. We had a really formal banquet on the second day there. I'm talking about 4 course meal, fancy napkin in your lap kind of deal. I expected to feel out of place, considering that I was sitting between Dr. Radford (head of math department at MUN) and the Parliamentary Secretary of Education, but I felt really comfortable. I felt like that was exactly where I wanted to be. I think I'm going to start studying harder.

I met a&nbsp;really hot, amazing&nbsp;Greek guy named Jason at the seminar. I spent most of my free time with him, and he was in my group for all the problem sessions, so technically we spent most of our time together. I haven't been able to stop thinking about him. Maybe my problem isn't with guys, its with the guys that are around here. Well, its a new first... first time I've ever had the urge to kiss a guy instead of doing it out of obligation. I feel stupid for not doing it."

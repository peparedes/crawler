"event","Another idea from Jess - I don't know if anyone else has read the Narnia books that have the original illustrations, but I noticed, with extreme excitement, an incredibly awesome drawing of the White Witch. In this picture, which unfortunately I cannot scan in at this moment, she's wearing her nice long cloak/tunic thing and hanging down from the bell sleeves are icicles. (Not real icicles, of course, but fabric.) I figure that cutting and sowing some of these ""icicles"" would be simple and inexpensive, as they could easily be made from scraps of fabric. Let me know what you think..."

"event","Please inform me as to whether or not you believe that the coming idea is incredibly corny, or just plain strange - or if, by some miracle of chance, you find the idea to be brilliant and a work of shear genius...

I believe I may have found a wand that the White Witch could use in our beloved play. I have found these acrylic icicles (I actually bought them for Christmas decorating). They are about two feet long, are quite sturdy, and are clear, but have a wonderful, luminescant/iridescent glow. I don't know what is involved in the Witch's wand, so strike me down if you feel that this idea will not do. But I was jousting with my mum when I was struck with such artistic creativity that I fashioned this idea. 

P.S. This is Jess"

For now, let's <lj-cut text=""cut to the chase!"">

Ok, we're working on a ""Murder Mystery"" ider.

We need:

A story line

A setting

Structure

What do we serve?

I understand that we want to do the ""lights out, dum dum dum"" thing, but this will probably be held in the cafeteria, and we need to think practically.

Not saying we can't do it!  Just need you to vocalize and tell me what your ideas are.

Here we go!"

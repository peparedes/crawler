It was way too late to call Nintendo customer service so I waited until today. Got a hold of Greg at Nintendo customer service today who, to make a long story short, told me I'm out of luck with the VC games and will have to buy them all again. They can send me a new Wii since this one is freezing. I also forgot to add that I got mine on launch day and that one was broken (it wouldn't perform a system update). I told him no for now. I'll call back. I'm going to have a girl call because somehow they're better at getting what they want than dudes are.

- stabbed someone and tried to wash his hands at my house
- tried to stab my friend
- made me give him rides so he could buy crack
- made me give him money (15- 35 cents at a time) so he could buy hits of crack
- brought a hooker over to my house as a favor because we were all such great friends (we obviously made them leave)
- told me that his cousin stole my 200 some dollar package of clothes off my front porch
- after yingling said ""what the fuck!?!"" to the aforementioned event he freaked out and we thought he was gonna shoot us but eventually just challenged us all to a push-up contest

man did i have a valentine's day.  my valentine (which wasn't mark as i previously thought it would be) and i ate at EL AZTECA and at the end of the meal some dude came over and gave us each a TRIPLE shot of Don Julio.  we drank them but it was rough.  then we went to the fly and i tried to call my good pal Davey J. Kiley because he had no idea that i was in his hood.  I had to borrow Corrine's phone because mine doesn't work in that bomb shelter of a bar.  I forgot that she still has a 414 number and not a 920 so i called his number without an area code.  some girl answered and i thought it was someone at Dave's answering and messing with me because he didn't recognize the number.  after 5 minutes of arguing with ""karen"" about this i finally realized my mistake and apologized.  actually i said, ""FINE. Sorry."" and hung up.  then i proceeded to spend 60 dollars (american) and carry Corrine back upstairs (i carried her downstairs, too).  then later i had to break up a fight because the bouncer at the fly is small.  they ask me to break up fights at a lot of bars that i go to.  it mostly ends up with me knowing the bouncers are on my side so i talk tons and tons of shit.  that's how this one ended, too.

and i was thinking of parties at ashleys like this night when me and stacey became friends. and when everyone at ashleys was wasted and i was sitting on the patio the night before easter having a really hard time thinking of how in the hell the easter bunny got in. then i decided that it was because he was like a janitor and had a huge set of keys to get into everyones house. and then i told spud he was gonna have the bestest easter basket ever. everrrrr. haha he as it on tape it was amazing. i miss those times so much. when everyone was home. we just wanted to have a good time. 

thats why im writing this. everything is going really smooth and im afraid of running into a rut. i havent worked in months. ive been down here where its 80 and breezy everyday and i wake up whenever i want. ride my horse and go to the gym. thats my everyday and i love it. and in a week im leaving it. back to work and cold. but at the same time its all worth it because i get to see joey again :-) and all of my friends that i miss so much. and i get to be with the stephs rockin waldorf. so its cool. i think ill be fine. im just getting used to being spoiled!! back to reality, i miss working tho. i miss my MAC ladies and the salon. it will be fineeee. so im leaving friday the 24th and we have to make some stops hopefully ill be home early on sunday!! yay!! i cant wait to see everyone. :-)"

"event","i have a lot of time to think and look around and realize things about the world.  think about how would things be different if i did something different at one time. would i be where i am now? i can read people really well. i want to know more about why people work the way they do and why one thing can make someone furious and someone else could care less. no i may not be making perfect sense. buts thats me i like to be confusing. 

my life is progressingly getting more difficult. i think its maybe because i have too much time to think and analyse ive always been bad when this happens. i guess im just worried certain things arent gonna be the same anymore. people moving, and stuff. it really sucks. and i still dont get the people who love conflict with others. im not gonna call it drama because 95% of people who say they hate drama are usually the worst people when it comes to drama. i would really love to travel the country with someone. it would basically be tour with no music. but ofcoarse im involved in a sport which i have to practice every single day. sometimes i hate that. but i love it too much if u know what i mean. im in the mood to just babble and write what comes to my head. speaking of writing... the famous author Tami Hoag rides horses with me. shes a wonderful lady and i didnt know she was so popular until certain places that i go and im with her people are like oh!! tami hoag!! and get her autograph. i cant imagine what it would be like to be so good at what u love to do people all over know u and admire u. thats so amazing. jerry just called and now im talking to stacey and jerry at the same time on speaker phone. 

i got a pretty bad sunburn today. it hurts and makes me feel gross. it reminds me of ocean city. :-) happy times.

"event","wow what an insane past 9 days or so. dec 26 i got in a car and drove down here to west palm beach, fl. we stayed here for a day and then we drove down to key west. which i might add is my most favorite place in the world.... and ive been to a lot of places. i went and layed on the beach then went swimming and then went out and got drunk. i drank everynight they never even thought about carding me!! that was exciting. and by the time new years eve got around i wasnt in the mood to get wasted but i did anyways. new years eve there was like nothing ive ever seen before. it was just the funnest thing ive ever experienced and if i had the money to take all my fiends down there with me next year to make it even better id do it! buttt i dont think i got the $$$ to do that. oh well. 

anyways... i rode today and it was hot as crap and i felt like i was going to pass out. i hate that feeling. bleheug. but it was awesome. im going to learn so much. 

the horsey stuff is all good and everything. but not much time goes by when im not thinking about my friends. i miss them sooo much. i miss everyone a lot more than i thought i would. i knew it was going to be hard but i didnt think it was going to be this hard. i also hate missing out on stuff... so that makes it kinda stinky. and i would love nothing more right now then to grab joeys face and kiss it 10000 times. i miss him. i miss everyone. 

i hope stacey jerry josh and erin are having fun being a cute little family in towson. lucky bitches. i hope everything works out good for them. im gonna be 19 in 10 days!!! and im gonna be here.... with no friends... :-( oh well. i'll live it up and maybe momma will take me shopping or something.  

anyways...i love u all. PLEASE call me whenever u ever feel like it!! <3<3"

im going to key west for new years that should be amazing. steph is coming because shes awesome and she loves me! 

i have a lot on my mind right now. i really wanna see people and hang out with people i used to everyday and never ever get to see anymore or really talk to even. ive been crying a lot more than usual. for a whole bunch of little different reasons. i guess one of the cool parts of moving far away is that the little things u want to throw away in life you can do much easier if you are far from it... i hope i change some when im gone. i hope a lot changes here. although 4 months can't do all that much. we'll see. 

well im gonna miss everyone. i love you all. im sure ill be on here lots soon. bye bye <3<3"

getting to a positive note.... me and erin cooked up probably the next most exciting thing in my life :-) a Christmas/ Thanksgiving party which is formal dresswear and the ladies are doin the cooking! and its at my house in my fancy never used dining room!! yay! im soo excited and we're gonna cook a turkey and take fancy cute pictures and we're all gonna be one big happy family. thats whats so wonderful about all of us. we arent a group of friends. we are a family. we yell at eachother, we cry, we laugh so hard we cant breath, we do pretty much everything together, and we all love eachother so much. im very greatful for the people i have in my life right now. and the thanksgiving/ christmas party is gonna be just wonderful.

"event","Im at work right now (Halo) and its boring but thats nice sometimes.
I realized today that I actually am addicted to something.... crack.

sike. im addicted to coffee. i love it and everything about it. 

Wow. I really am bored. sorry.

So I talked to Ashley today and she told me she will probably be coming home soon, that is so exciting! I cant wait to have her living here again. It's gona be fun. 

Thursday night Sam and Steph are coming with me while I house sit. We get to be with the dogs which are the cutest things ever. and we get to play karaoke revolution and drink wine all night. which is my new favorite drink.. besides coffee... and yes. its gonna be fun. i'll post pictures 

speaking of pictures ive been lacking on my picture taking... i think i used to post pictures like once a week. maybe i dont anymore cuz my camera is in joeys car and he stole the batteries from me. poohead.

the weather is more than perfect and that means i get to ride everyday. i need to get all ready and in shape for this winter. 

yayy.

"event","Im at a time where im waiting for something bad to happen because everything in my life right now is perfect. Im so happy with everyone and everything i just couldnt ask for any better. Maybe im havng good Karma :-) 

anywaysss. i am dissapointed in the lack of parties tho lately. I miss staceys parties at her house they were fun and ashleys were pretty sweet too. but none of that. i guess ill have a party soon. my sister is moving to california again and my parents are going with her for a bit. yayy. so ill have a party here that'll be nice. i just miss BIG parties with a ton of people there like friends who i would rarely see and only see at a party. like Larrys house. which is no longer larrys house, that makes me kinda sad i have a lot of wonderful memories there. 

my sister got married this weekend. that was a fun drunken big party i guess. i got joey to dance and secretly he loved every second of it. he thinks straight white boys dont dance, unless they are gay. or extremly drunk. 

i really want more friends. florida is sneeking up on me and i will make friends there. thats so exciting. 4 months. and a bunch will change. luckily i will be able to fly home everynow and then i hope. im going to miss people and it might drive me crazy. so i better get some visits as well. <3

love."

"event","ive never gone through so many changes in my life as i have this summer. its crazy. i feel like a new person right now, im not sure how much i really like it. we'll see.

i think about all whats happened since new years and its just crazy to me how much has happened. im not the type of person to sit around and wait for things. so i move from thing to thing very fast. i've become very strong too, well no, maybe its just more independent. im just going through weird changes. i miss some people a lot. amie came up to me and i just freaked out its been so long since ive seeh her. and pete and brent i was with them like 24/7 for a while and havent seen them in forever. its just weird to have people gone. like ashley. i miss her so bad man. i wish i could have gone to see her with stacey. but no... i had to work.

i have a bad gut feeling about things lately. like i should be doing something that im not. although. this summer has been adventurous and very unlike any other summer. 

sams b-day is this week. i want to get her something glorious. like a pony. or a bike. it is afterall her 18th.... yaaay!!

last night was fun. like 75% of my friends were at mbp which was crazy. i cant explain how much i freakin love my friends. everyone is just awesome. i love you. then everyone came here. i didnt get drunk, thats dissapointing but its ok cuz i did on sunday and thursday. 

overall im pretty content with my life right now. it could be better. but it could also be a lot worse. so im happy :-)"

things have gotten better for me. basically relationships for me are done for a while. maybe... hehe

last night was carazy. i got drunk before anyone was here. i was like o i'll just make a drink and theyll show up any minute. like 20 minutes go by and im gone it was so much fun. the group of people here last night was awesome. i think thats what i liked about it so much. besides the amount of crops on my back porch. if my parents woke up last night. i seriously dont know what i would have done. i did everything bad i have ever done that i dont like my parents knowing last night. bad bad bad. and then tonight my mom was like i love you cate ur a good kid. i just wanted to die. i felt bad all day. hungover and stuff. but o well it was fun. and i really didnt do anything bad. im rambling and making so sense.

"event","ive never had so much to say about just 2 days in my life before. ocean city was amazing. besides the perverted nasty guys and then the ones with their ""cool"" cars. sunday night got crazy. it was a vodka night and at like 1 in the morning me and pete wanted to get in the hottub/ bath thingy and my friend nikky and ryan joined us, it was weird and we put shampoo in it and shampoo is better than any other bubble bath soap ive ever used. the bathtub experience was pretty awesome. then we had to go sleep on the hardass floor with one blanket it was nice... the next day the crazy bitches who wake up at 9 woke everyone else up too. and we layed out on the beach until like 330. im burnt like hell and it hurts. i put this tanning oil on all over me so im retarted i deserve it. hahaha but pete was laying next to me and i put some on his right leg and later on he was in so much pain cuz his one leg was so burnt. i felt so bad. but it was really funny. so after thattt as soon as we got in the condo i started drinking and it took a bit to hit me. this guy next door got naked and was running around in the bay knocking on peoples doors. it was really funny and like an hour later i was sitting out on the deck and he was like COME HERE!! and i made him come upstairs and i guess someone told him pete was my boyfriend.. thank god so he just said i was hott or something to him it doesnt sound that funny but he was so drunk it made it funnier. i saw so many people who i havent seen in so long. it was awesome people who i went to pre k to 8th grade with drinking with me. last night was just a play night. we went to the boardwalk and then got unlimited tickets to go go-carting for an hour with caleb steph and brooks. that was fun besides the bruises on my back. and then we ate mcdonalds that made us sick. and we couldnt fall asleep so me and pete took a big blanket out to the beach and layed, laying in the beach is just one of those things that you only get to do every now and then and the fact that pete was with me made it even better. haha he tried to make it look like our silhouette was doing it to these guys who were smoking weed on the lifeguard chair. we decided to just come home then instead of waiting till 7 with like no sleep. so we came home at 430 this morning and i kept having to wake him up cuz he was falling asleep.. and he was driving. so neither of us could sleep. that last hour was hard. this whole trip was awesome. im so happy right now. but i need to go sleep. &lt;3&lt;3 pictures coming soon"

im really thinking about not working today. im so tired of being there its turned into where i am everyday all day it feels like. and that sucks. 

saturday night me and stacey and everyone else went to this party in deer woods. it was fun i saw a whole bunch of people i havent seen in forever. mike and scott are so different now its weird. we got crazy with them tho. thats the night i realized explosions in the sky did weird things to my head and thats why i love them so much. ... that sounded cracked out but really im not.

hanging out a lot with everyone. back to old times with spud. yay!

its so weird how when relationships end sometimes. u and that person just stop talking.

my horsey is coming home tomorrow and im very excited. hes getting so big. i love it. 

mac is pretty awesome. the longer im there the more into it i get. which is normally opposite. im getting better and better at it, its definitly one of those things that the more u practice no matter how good u are u always get better. britt harlan might be working with me in the summer and that would be amazing. i hope she gets the job!

ashley is gone. so no more tripod. its me and s dawg. and we're gonna have a re-do of summer '04. except she has a job now. haha. there will be lots of lounging by the pool.

"event","First before i even get to the cop thing, my day was shit at work. Just cuz the sun was out everyone and there whole god damn family had to come to jamba juice today because it was so hot. It was REALLY alot hotter in Jamba than it was outside. FUCK blah and shit; Tomorrow is Friday the busy-ist day of the week. ::sigh:: i might just die tomorrow. fuck fuck shit fuck. anyways on to tonight...

What the fuck is wrong with the cops in Foster City. I mean they are the only ones with really nothing to do. Tonight i got a ticket for not stopping at a stop sign when i know i saw the cop and i did stop. I just rolled a little forward and i suposedly followed the car behind me. Whatever. DAMMMMMIT!!! Arg. Fuck i really didnt need this right now. FUCK. I think what pissed me off even more was the face that when he pulled me over he told me he was near the intersection and was watching me. Then after he was done writting out the ticket he comes back and said i was sitting over in the parking lot next to pizza hut and i was kinda confused so i just said no. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. I really wish it was something for my car. Like the first time i EVER got pulled over was in FC and it was by the cool cop that stopped us in the Taco Bell parking lot and was just really chill about us being underage and stuff. He pulled me over for my lights being out cuz my fuse box was being stupid. So he just let me off with a warning. Then this asshole just had to write me a ticket even when he said it wasnt a big deal. What a fuck face. arg. I hope lindsay could find that web site for me bout fighting the ticket and stuff. I called my mom and my grandma about it and the both think i should fight it. On the up hand of things there was only one cop and 2 of me (vinita and i) so maybe that will help my case. blah. venting feels good. I think im going to go to bed now cuz I have work tomorrow and i just need to cool off. 

goodnite."

"event","Randomly this morning at 7:15ish i had some weird fever that was 102.6 degree's. All last night i was shivering and saying i had the chills. I had a feeling somthing was wrong. I dont know where it came from. My mom said it was from running around all the time my body just kinda gave up for a second. I took two Tylonol (sp?? i really dont care) and By like 10:25 this morning it was gone. So now i am back to 98.0 degree's i guess almost normal. Im not to sure how hot the body usually is...

I got scared when i felt inflamed cuz when i was little i almost died from a fever. Im still a little dizzy and i think im going to go take some more tylonol to see if my temp goes down any more. :( poor me oh well theres my random story."

"event","wow its been a while since i have up dated. 

Really just here saying hi and wanted to talk about two things since i am here. yesterday which was such a LONG day and today with my evil experience with a evil porto-potty!

1) <b> DAMN JAMBA JUICE PAT!!!</b> 

So yesterday I worked at Jamba Juice. But the day before i asked the guy that opened if he wanted me to open and he said sure, so i was happy because i was going to be getting my hours in because i didn't work too much last week. Then i get a call from him saying that he wants to open instead, so i said fine. Then at ass o'clock in the morning (3AM) he calls and tells me he doesn't want to go in because he is tired!! ass hole but of course i said yes because again i needed the hours. So i tired to go back to sleep and see if i can get a lil more sleep, but of course my body being the way it is.... it doesn't want to sleep!!!#^@&!!!!! So i get to work and tell Ginelle (the coolest person to work with) about what happened. Then i was supposed to leave work at 1:30PM but i ended up leaving at FUCKING 2:10PM I was so tired. I didn't sleep till.................8:45 - 9:00PM that night. Im still trying to recover. I had the worst cough because i felt my immune system failing, and i had the worst headache ever!

2) <b>The Porto-Potty Experience</b> 

okie so Vinita and i decided to take a nap in my car before she had to go to work because we had nothing to do. So my bladder decides to be full all of a sudden and there were three other cars in the parking lot with us, mind you we were in the look out point/ jog point behind the golf course on Third Ave, and i was just thinking about popping a squat but i couldn't because people were around. So i HAD to use the porto-potty. OMG there were spiders and spider webs EVERYWHERE, the floor was obviously wet and the mans urinal thingy that is usually on the side wall when you walk in was like pasty with man piss paste in it and the only good thing was it really honesty didn't smell that bad. But when i went to go and pee i swear to god i didn't touch the seat with my ass!!!!! I like practically stood above the seat thing and tried my damnedest to piss in the toilet. then when i got out of there i had the jitters! it felt like something crawled up my ass or something. anyways. yea there is the evils of the porto-potty.


the end.





Vinita has a job now yay! I am hoping to get new hours and my mom said okay on a tattoo for me, she just wants to see it first before i do it ( i know she wants me to do something hawaiian.). mom finally got a opening on a child support case YAY for her. AAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDD yes............. okie.

HONOR IS BESTOWED BY MODERN ROCK PROGRAMMERS AND MUSIC INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY; 

THE NEW YORK TIMES CALLS A PERFECT CIRCLE'S NEW ALBUM ""A SOUNDTRACK FOR BLUE-STATE MALAISE""</b>

Maynard James Keenan, front man and vocalist for Virgin Records' critically-acclaimed recording group A Perfect Circle, has been voted Best Male Artist in Modern Rock in FMQB's prestigious 2004 Leaders Poll. In a field packed with a host of stellar candidates including Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong and Velvet Revolver's Scott Weiland. Keenan's passion and artistry vaulted him to the top of the online poll, which was tabulated from votes by Modern Rock radio programmers, label executives, and music industry professionals all across the country. This illustrious accolade marks the second year in a row that Keenan has been honored by the FMQB Leader Poll in 2003, the APC vocalist was named Best Rock Artist.

Keenan and A Perfect Circle are ending 2004 with one triumph after another. The band's latest album, eMOTIVe, made a stunning #2 with-a-bullet debut on the Billboard 200 when it was released on November 2. The collection, which sees APC reimagining radical rock classics for a new generation, was the top-selling record on three SoundScan sales charts: Top Album Retailers, Top Hard Music Albums, and Digital Albums (marking the first-ever Virgin Records release to top the Digital Albums listing).

A Perfect Circle's second consecutive #2 entry, eMOTIVe is also the band's third consecutive top 5 debut.

Along with the commercial success of eMOTIVe, the album has reaped a wide range of critical acclaim in a variety of national publications, including Rolling Stone, Revolver, Entertainment Weekly, and the New York Daily News.

Described by Keenan as a collection of songs about war, peace, love and greed, eMOTIVe finds APC bridging three decades of protest songs, spanning an array of genres hardcore punk and heavy metal, new wave and Delta blues, folk rock and rhythm & blues.

Jon Pareles spotlighted the album in the Sunday New York Times Playlist section recently, praising new arrangements of old songs [that] switch familiar tunes like ""Imagine"" and ""What's Going On"" into minor keys behind Maynard James Keenan's desolate, androgynous croon. Noting the album's themes of war and annihilation, Pareles writes that the album's ominous tone and bleak pessimism make it a soundtrack for blue-state malaise.

In addition to classic protest songs by John Lennon and Marvin Gaye, eMOTIVe also includes such insurgent classics as Memphis Minnie's blues stomper, ""When The Levee Breaks"" (made famous by Led Zeppelin), Fear's ""Let's Have A War"", and Depeche Mode's ""People Are People."" The album also features a pair of thought-provoking APC originals, ""Counting Bodies Like Sheep To The Rhythm Of the War Drums"" and ""Passive.""

And just two short weeks after eMOTIVe made its mark on the charts, the band released their first-ever DVD, aMOTION, a collection of APC's classic videos along with an assortment of imaginative remixes. aMOTION also hit the charts with a bang, coming in at #4 on SoundScan's Top Music Video chart.

eMOTIVe is A Perfect Circle's third full-length release, following 2000's RIAA platinum-certified Mer De Noms, and 2003's platinum-selling Thirteenth Step."

Person #4: WOW what can i say bout her. She blows me away bout everything she does and says. I dont think i could have a better friend. She has not only helped me when i decided to make dumb decisions she introduced me to hookah and got me shit faced on GRID night. hahah We might get into our little arguments and i might make her feel like i am integregating (sp? i dont care) her but i hope she knows i love her!

"event","It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then. That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too. When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this. You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this. You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. ""If God is our Father,"" you thought, ""then Satan must be our cousin."" Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too.

The Patient

A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful.
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on.
Draining patience, drain vitality.
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here.

Wait it out,
Gonna wait it out,
Be patient (wait it out).

If there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
Gonna wait it out.

If there were no desire to heal
The damaged and broken met along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now.

And I still may ... (sigh) ... I still may.

Be patient.
I must keep reminding myself of this.

"event","I just wanted to say that i am sorry to everyone that is close to me. I though that i would be able to control the way that i have been feeling but i guess i really cant. I was just listing all the things that have been giving me stress lately and they have nothing to do with any of you. Im sorry if i take or have taken out my anger on any of you. I dno how much longer all this stuff is going to be going on for.
<b>1.</b> Jamba Juice calls me last minute, but I need to go in cuz of money.
<b>2.</b> RoundTable is being really bitchy with people. I need a raise...
<b>3.</b> I dont have my weekends completely off anymore. Less time with friends and vinita... all which is my escape and relaxation.
<b>4.</b> My dad doesn't care if my brother and I dont have a house/clothes/food/transportation/school and money. FUCKING ASS givin my mom all this greif. arg! i want to... just... arg. I just have to realize that my dad is never EVER going to be there for us. I never got to have a childhood cuz of him. I have been working since i was in the 5th grade and i was never ever able to go out and play with my friends cuz my dad didnt let us out (my mom worked full time (early morning to late afternoon) and my dad worked graveyard) He has scared me with so much grief. FUCKING ASSHOLE!@ arg.
<b>5.</b> Mom on disability (no direct income, no child support, just my income. I really want to help but my mom and everyone else doesnt think it is my problem. well you know what it is my problem when i am living in the house. It is my problem when my mom is not functioning the way she used to. It is my problem when 
<b>6.</b> I am really sore; i am in pain all the time now, trying to deal with emotional problems, coping with vinita being gone (even though i see her on the weekends its still hard with all this shit) and trying really hard to help her too. 
<b>7.</b> School is really giving me a headache. If im not a full time student my health insurance goes up $500 dollars but i cant juggle that and working. right now i need all the income i can get. But i cant do too much school cuz i cant afford it. so its a total loose loose situation. FUCK!

"event","<u><b>The break adventure of Alex and I</b></u>

OKIE so it all started with the computer lab and looking at jonny deep and orlando bloom making out on this gay mans myspace page :) sexy yes. Since we were hungry we decided to go over to the cafeteria. Fun stuff. When we walked it this loud crashing sound of waves of some sort and yoga music was blasting. Scared the shit out of me. The first thing i thought was What The Fuck is this Shit! So after passing the annoying music we went to go get drinks to complement the sandwich that Alex picked up. To get to the cold drinks there is a coffee machine that you have to pass. Some chick was getting coffee and just started to moan ""mmmm oooo coffee"" We looked at eachother and walked away quickly. We sit down to eat near windows and across from the stairs that go down to the bookstore. I pick up FASA, BOG, and the spring semester booklet and we eat. As we are eating we, well mainly Alex, was watching this couple just plain flat out were fucking around in the court yard. 

Alex - ""Oh shit look look look, dammit""
Courtney - ""what?!""
Alex - ""this couple is like having LOOOOK, dammit, sex over there, Its like watching demented cartoon porn""
Courtney - ""can't they see you?""
Alex - (ghetto alex) therrs a paper rite front my FACE!""
Courtney - ""what the fuck?!, your ghetto now?""
Alex - *laughs*

After we were done eating we went outside so i could call Vinita to see if she was finally awake. Alex bought a Pepsi when we were in the cafeteria and as we were walking her bottle, i guessed at the time, was making noises. She was like do you hear my soda. I was thinking ""hear your soda?"" So she was making songs with her soda. It was amusing. 

After the whole soda thing we walked alittle more and talked about gay and lesbian stuff. We then officaly named Alex a lesbian since she is now in college.

Then we talked about group theray and individual therapy.
Alex - ""Yea Vinita knows Sarah from group""
Courtney - ""did you do group?""
Alex - *does little twirly thing with her finger against her head* ""They basically said 'Im too stupid for group'""

Then last but not least I had some xtra candy and i forgot bout it and Alex was trying to call me a bitch and a bastard at the same time so it came out like this...
Courtney - ""oh candy""
Alex - ""oh man you had candy and you didnt tell me you batchard!""
Courntey - ""what!!!!?""
Alex - ""hahah batchard i was trying to call you a bastard and a bitch at the same time and that came out.""

and now i am going to get going cuz i have to get to work. goodie go smoothies...
bye bye i will reuturn at 6ish i hope."

"event","So i am in the puter lab again. Not doing anything. i skipped english just cuz i really didnt want to go. ::sigh:: so anywho. last night was alright i guess. I dno why i had to work.. blah oh well money right?! anywho. ummm this weekend was really good. 
<b>fri 10/29</b> 
Vinita came home at 6:10 or something like that. Then we went over to Kallee's to meet up with her and Lindsay. Then we went to Subway (:)) and then went to expressions to eat. Then went to the little puter lab so i could check something in my email, then took a tour of expressions for Vinita. Bout 8ish 9ish we Vinita and i went back to my house and watched a little bit of tv and messed on the puter then went to sleep. 

<b>sat 10/30</b> 
I woke up at like 8 thinking it was 11 i dno how i did that but i did. Im sorry babe. Then we got up for breakfast and got ready to go out with my mom. We went to Hillsdale and Tower. Then we went home and Vinita and I helped my mom out with the buisness that my mom and i have going. My mom and I put together the photo albums and vinita ironed the material we are going to be making the key chains with. Then we went to Teri's to say hi and drop off some candy and coffee things and i gave her a free small photo album. fun times, then Vinita and i had to meet my family at Fuji's. After dinner Vinita and i went to blockbuster to go get some movies, they didnt have what she wanted to i picked up Saved (haha NO.. some parts were funny but i am so sick of JESUS that i could fucking ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh) and Twisted (my aunt is in that. If you get the DVD it is chapter 4 she is teaching Ashley Judd how to defend herself.) Then we went to bed. 

<b>sun 10/31</b> 
I woke up around 10ish but since it was daylight savings it was really 9ish. Ate breakfast and Vinita and i went out with my mom and grams to Cosco, Michaels and joann fabrics. then after that we went home and helped my mom a bit on her projects. Then chilled with vinita for a bit then my radiator blew up all over the side of my grandma's house. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK now im out a car and ride to work and school cuz my grandma needs her car back cuz she got into a car accident last week and there car needs to go into the shop. I then went back to my house to go get pissed off in my room while vinita calmed me down. Then i took her to Teri's at 15 to 5 (Teri was taking her to the Emeryville train station since she was pickin up Meghan (7:50pm)) and i went to work from 5- 10ish. It was halloween and it was my first halloween to work and deal with idiots. I made $17.00 in tips though so its all good. Lindsay, Kallee, Dan, Anthony said hi to me when they came in to see me. I was going to go drink with Nadia and Bobby but i was really beat. So I went home and showered called my baby to make sure she got home okay and went to bed.

<b>mon 11/01</b> 
Well today... I have school till 12 then i have work at 1-6pm then i am just going to come home, help my mom out some more and chill. im so beat. ::sigh:: i really hope my paychecks look nice! I need them bad. Since im not going to take a full time student day my health insurance is going to go up. FUCK! I really just need to work. ::sigh:: Im trying really hard to make everyone happy and still have time for myself. 

I hope everyone else had a good weekend too. It was amazing to me that my mom let vinita stay the whole weekend. It was really nice. It kinda reminded us of summer. I wish i could get that back. I love you babe."

<b>+thursday 21, 2004</b>
Went to Sacramento after class. yay. class... then just stayed in vinita's dorm room with her. it was really nice. Rest is good! i never ever sleep as well as i do than when i am with her. oh she had just one class that day. We also went to go get some food from McDonalds and then came back and didnt do too much. we had a really good conversation that night! but we had to hear choquette and her boy toy make sex noises. Its okay babe! do what lindsay said.
<b>+friday 22, 2004</b>
Woke up and vinita had class, she came back in between her classes. I got to know her dorm mate melissa some more. i guess she is alright. then vinita and i then since the DC wasnt open we went to KFC and then some place called pizza guys to get pizza to take home for later.  Got that night alone!!! it was nice.
<b>+saturday 23, 2004</b>
Vinita and i got up and didnt do to much, watched the sixth sence and stuff. fun fun. then randomly that night we went with lindsay and kallee (cuz they called me) to go up to tahoe since it was snowing. haha it was so random but really fun. My toes were so cold when we got back to vinitas room. but then it got really hot that night. not bad but it was warm.
<b>+sunday 24, 2004</b>
Kallee and Lindsay came to get me from richmond with a ""CHUN party of one"" sign and some newspaper flowers. It was really sad leaving sac. it was such a good weekend. then we went to Subway to get lunch back to kallee's and now im here at expressions. i think vinita is working right now for some play thingy as a usher... i think she should be done at like 5ish.

 I had a nice conversation with a boy last night. It's kinda funny how all of my conversations with him somehow become long and meaningful out of nowhere. I try not to think much of it. I now know that he dreams about me... in <i>that</i> way... I'm almost happy about myself now. I never thought that a boy would have those kinds of dreams about someone like myself. Horay for me. 
 I shall be going over to his house with another boy to have a Halo contest today. Then it'll be time to kick ass. I'm the best at the game, especially at the Warthog.

 Yesterday was so boring... I didn't do much except maybe walk to the A & P to get my dad a late father's day present. I couldn't go on father's day because I had Ram over for the first time in a year. I really hate the fact that I moved here, I want to go back to brooklyn so I can see Ram more. It's just so boring and quiet in New Jersey...
 
 Um... yeah... I think that's the end of my rantings for today. Peace."

"event","<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow. I mean holy shit. I actually made a halfway decent journal layout. I didn't think I could do that. Horay for me. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why I started this thing. I don't expect many people to read this let alone even know it's there. I can pretend I care. I've got nothing better to do with my time anyway.&nbsp;I won't be doing anything this summer other then maybe sitting in front of the computer and going to summer school... Christ. Of all people, I never thought I'd have to go to summer school. Being seen with those people as we were led away from graduation practice was horrible. I am ashamed.&nbsp;This just leads to another lesson in life. I'll learn from it and try harder next year. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Um... I have nothing to do today.&nbsp;Maybe I'll go for a walk... damn, it's hot out... or is it just me? ... </FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>"

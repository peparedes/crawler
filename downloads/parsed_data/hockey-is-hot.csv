"event","So yesterday i had another little ""party"" thing. Bill, Krista, Cristina, Hogan, Nathan, Steven, Angie, Nikki and Dillon came. It was one of my better ones. We didnt swim much tho. It was mostly indoors, other then cigarettes and trampoline. Bill brought his DDR so we played that. Me and Krista played pool against Hogan and Dillon. That was quite interesting, especially neigher one of them can play pool. We played 3 games, they won 2 of them just because we scratched on the 8 ball. So later, Bill and Cristina made out in the spare bedroom while the rest of us were chilling on the trampoline. They came out and them me and angie went in there. Haha, then Nikki and Hogan decided to join us. So then of course my mom walks in. She just kinda said something to me then shut the lights back off then closed the door. Wow i love my mom. That was wicked fun. Earlier in the pool, it was only me, nikki, angie, krista, dillon and hogan. To we all decided to gang up on nikki and pull her top off hen hide it from her. THAT was fun. :D then me and angie decided to take ours off too. haha were losers. I cooked on the grill later and they were all calling me butch. *pouts* But whatever.
Anywho, i had fun. Defiantely doing it again, soon. <3"

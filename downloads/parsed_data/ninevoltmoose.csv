"event","<P>I've always been somewhat of a systemic malcontent, I've never met a way of doing things that I couldn't find some&nbsp;way to improve.&nbsp; It used to be that these were little gripes about the minutia of how this aspect or that aspect could be marginally improved, but over the past few years I've become a little bit more radical.&nbsp; Now by radical, I don't mean I want to go destroying things.&nbsp; I mean radical in the sense that I'm sick of systems which are blatantly behind the times, even dangerously so.&nbsp; These are systems which had serious problems in the beginning and which haven't really evolved into something better as time has progressed.&nbsp; Some have even evolved into things which are actually worse.&nbsp; Now it's important here to define what I mean when I say good, because it is slanted heavily:

<STRONG>Sustainable:</STRONG>&nbsp;A system must be designed and built in such a fashion that it may exist and perform without causing environmental damage.&nbsp; When possible, a system should actually contribute to overall environmental health as a byproduct of its existance/operation.&nbsp; Additionally, materials used in the construction/operation of said system should be ""<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_to_Cradle"">Cradle to Cradle</A>"" materials.&nbsp; It doesn't take much introspection to see that the way we're doing things now is woefully destructive to the environment and by direct extension to us.&nbsp; We need to be building systems which are part of the solution, not the problem.

<STRONG>Empowering:</STRONG>&nbsp; When possible/applicable a system should empower those who use it to become better individuals.&nbsp; We aren't used to thinking about systems this way but its about damn time. By not thinking about it, we've created an entire world full of systems which isolate, belittle, frustrate, and generally do nothing more than the bare ""utility"" we've proscribed to them.&nbsp; By building systems which encourage those who use them to become happier, healthier, and&nbsp;more aware of the world, the more favors we will be doing ourselves in the long run.&nbsp; No one product or system will ever grant us sainthood, but at the very least we can start building systems which aren't fighting us.&nbsp; I'm reading a book on this very topic right now called <A href=""http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300137491"">Sustainability By Design</A>.&nbsp; It's a chewy read as the author takes you through a very thorough case for his ideas, but definitely worth a read if you like this kind of stuff.

<STRONG>Practical/Pragmatic:</STRONG>&nbsp; Sometimes I see proposals for systems floating around on the Net and I just have to laugh.&nbsp; The ideas are inventive and the intentions are admirable, but the systems as described just couldn't be made to exist without seriously changing the way the population at large is used to using technology.&nbsp; A system must be practical to build, practical to operate, require only minimal adjustment by those who use it, and must be useful and effective from day one.

<STRONG>Incremental Deployment:</STRONG>&nbsp; Any system which cannot be built/deployed in a incremental fashion is doomed to forever remain a drawing on a designers' desk.&nbsp; New systems, like internet memes, need to start small and spread virally based on their success.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons its taken the US so damned long to get high speed rail; nobody wants to pay for a half-built network of rail lines.

<STRONG>Low Upkeep Costs:</STRONG>&nbsp; Systems by their nature do require investment over time to keep them effective and up to date, however a system which gobbles money continuously is a bad system at best.

<STRONG>Flexibility:</STRONG> A system must be able to adapt/be adapted to fit a wide range of operating conditions and do so with minimal additional cost.

There's a whole constellation of other assorted factors that I feel are crucial to a good system, and I'm sure I will remember all of them precisely two minutes after I post this entry.&nbsp; It is worth noting that what I call&nbsp;""systems"" includes a wide variety of things including but not limited to products, infrastructure, and&nbsp;services.

So with all of this in mind, I am starting a series of posts which I'm entitling Build It Better.&nbsp; In these, I will be singling bad&nbsp;systems out, holding them down, and mercilessly beat them to a bloody pulp.&nbsp; I will then proceed to suggest my own brands of systemic villany, because I'm an egotistical tool who likes hearing himself talk (at least I'm honest about it).&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to follow along as I decend further into my caffiene induced hallucinations of a world filled with systems which don't suck.

"event","<P>Okay, so about two years ago I started working on a webcomic called the Scorch Sisters.&nbsp; It was going to be freaking sweet.&nbsp; It had spaceships, big guns, explosions, and&nbsp;badass&nbsp;dinosaur chick heroines.&nbsp; What it did not have, as I discovered rather quickly, was a writer who had any fucking clue what he was doing. 

<lj-cut>&nbsp; At the time, I was looking for some way to&nbsp;Make My Mark, the most troublesome and pitfall-prone three word ambition to my knowledge.&nbsp; In my pursuit of this lofty goal I got impatient, as I often do,&nbsp; and decided to hell with actually figuring out my story and just jumped straight into it head first.&nbsp; This would have been folly enough, but not only am I impatient and ambitious, I am also a masochist.&nbsp; I decided that the only ""real"" way to do the comic was to do it in watercolor, a medium I had little to no actual experience in. This&nbsp;required the use of watercolor paper, a paper so hostile to my scratchy sketching style that half the time I was fighting the paper instead of focusing on telling the story with effecive images.&nbsp; Between my lack of a story beyond a very general notion of some elements I wanted&nbsp; to include and the difficulty of the medium, I ran into trouble fast.&nbsp; Ideas which I thought were cool in the beginning quickly lost their luster upon implementation and my awesome story idea quickly swung into the ""lol wtf were you thinking bro"" category.&nbsp; So after about 7 pages of all of this, I terminated the project, disgusted with myself and general project idea.&nbsp; This began a long period for me where I didn't really do any art on my offtime, which was due partially to getting an art job at a (in name only) game company and partially due to me feeling like a failure who must hide his shame from the world.&nbsp;

So with all of that in mind where does this leave the project?&nbsp; Well, I got fired from said job (long story, I'll tell you later), so there's no more need to worry about it interfering timewise.&nbsp; Secondly, I'm now far more interested in actually taking the time to think through my stories (yes its grown beyond just one now) which means that I'll actually have something concrete to work against once I do start producing it.&nbsp; Thirdly, I've given up on the pretense of being a natural at watercolor and have vowed to do as much of the production as possible digitally where I know my tools and I'm not fighting the medium.&nbsp; Ultimately, it leaves the project back a square one, but now with some important lessons learned.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, I will discover a whole new batch of things to do wrong as I reboot the series, but that's why these things are considered hard.</lj-cut></P>"

"event","Ok, for fucks sake I need to settle down and actually start writing. 

It's not like I have a shortage of things to write about, and endlessly piddling around between platforms, looking for ""just the right one"" is just procrastination. It's the kind of like an evolved form of that behavior you get in middle school when you know you have to write a paper, but you can't bring yourself to get past choosing just the right font. Enough of this, I say. 
<lj-cut>
This time I hope I mean it too, because I've said it before and ended up right back here, frustrated at my lack of writing when I know I have shit to say. I tried starting up a seperate livejournal account <lj user=""ideastogo"">, thinking that maybe if I seperated it out from my ""normal postings"" (which I don't do) that it would somehow encourage me to write more. At that point I was on a real attention whorage bent, so when my moderate levels of posting there failed to attract enough precious attention, I migrated to Blogspot, thinking that <I>surely</I> I would recieve validating feedback there. Wrong. I even created a Tumblr account, which I rapidly abandoned for reasons unkown. Actually, scratch that, I do know the reason. The reason I choke when I intend to post things is I have some glorious self-diagnosed form of performance fear. I am absolutely terrified of other people seeing me exposed and judging me. This is, of course, hillarious given the fact that I am posting all this on the Internet, where the very concept of private is wishful thinking at best. So after all of this, it's time to face the dragons. Let's start by stating the obvious problems: I am horrible at communicating to other people, and I have the attention span of a caffienated jack-russel terrier. Now that we have the mea culpa over and done with, lets talk about what I want to do. Be sure to grab some asprin, because this shit may make your head hurt:

<UL>
<LI>I want to write a series of webcomics, specifically rebooting the aborted Scorch Sisters series I almost never actual did a issue of. More analysis on how to correct my missteps there later. </LI>
<LI>I have ideas (granted half-baked ones), about systems and inventions that I want to try and explain. I also want people to tell me why I am wrong, so I can make them better or get into pissy internet arguments over it. </LI>
<LI>I want to start a goddamn nation. A real one, just virtual. I need to explain my thinking behind this system, and describe the systems (see above) that I feel would be needed to institute it. I want to create a global liberal digital democracy which will make every black-helicopter NWO conspiracy-theorist shit their pants. Fuck, why not? So many things in this world are changing too fast for the old dinosaur governments, we need to start experimenting with newer methods of governance</LI>
<LI>I want to actually start writing down my thoughts on random ass shit, becuase as much as I love my wife, I know I torture her with all of my insane ramblings about topics when I know she wants me to be enjoying the here and now. </LI>
<LI>I'm actually a half decent artist, although I know I can be better. I want to share what I know, or at least what I think I know, with the lot of you.</LI>
<LI>I want to talk about my life, something I've never really done. I want to talk about my feelings, and make friends with people who don't think I'm a whiny bitch. Tall order, I know. </LI>
</UL>

But what I definitely do know is that I'm tired of being quiet, I'm tired of second guessing myself over what people will say. I think I've already driven away several friends and relations because of this, and enough is enough. To those of you who have had the decency of watching this account through its long drought of non-postage, thank you. I promise that I'm fairly sure I'm still the same goofball I always was, and I will try to keep the rageyness to a minimum. 

Let's do this fucking thing

Let me begin by saying that I am not one of your constituents.  I am a recent college graduate from the state of Maine living and working in Georgia.  Despite this, I feel it is necessary and prudent to write to you because of the unique position you hold in relation to the current financial crisis we face.  I write to you not only because you are a Senator of New York State, but because you are respected as a leader, looked to as a role model for millions.  You have also shown that you are not afraid of advocating big ideas, and fighting for them even in the face of the harshest opposition.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In this historic financial crisis, simply purchasing the debt of the failed financial institutions won't do.  Neither will the granting of unprecedented and unchecked power to the Secretary of the Treasury.  We are reaping some of the most bitter fruits of supply-side economics, a policy which was flawed in its very concept and poisonous in its application.  To write a blank check to those who have lost their gamble for excessive amounts of wealth on the backs of the American people who are already struggling would be immoral and irresponsible.  It would signal to those who would take similar gambles that as long as they act as though the sky will fall should they go bankrupt, the American public will always subsidize their losses.  It would turn Americas partnership with free enterprise into a twisted systematic version of a abusive marriage. Much like where  one spouse threatens the other that if they do not pay for their racetrack losses, the other would be thrown out of the house or worse.  You and I both know that not only is this situation avoidable, it must be avoided.  Not just to prevent further abuses, but for the future of the American people.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Being as informed as you are,I understand that you know all of this. I am not writing to you under the pretense of a lecture in market regulation.  I write to posit to you a idea which you may have already considered some variation of.  If that is the case, consider this letter one of support for such a measure.  While I am greatly opposed to the concept of simply forgiving the debt of the failed institutions as many Americans are, I think there is great opportunity to be found in treating it as a investment.  Given the depleted state of the Treasury and our current lamentable commitments to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, you and I are both aware that we are desperately short for funding in a time where major investments in America's infrastructure are needed.  Our power grid is proving woefully inadequate for the challenges posed by alternative energy production, which will be a lynch pin in our efforts to secure lasting energy independence.  Our nation lags far behind others in terms of broadband internet availability, which is already beginning to impact our economic and academic competitiveness in the world.  As we face once again the specter of fuel shortages, our public transportation systems, especially rail, languish in neglect.   As I write to you, many of my compatriots in the Southeast are in the impossible situation of being unable to go to work because the gas stations are out of gas, and the public transportation options are inadequate or non-existent.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">As much as some of your compatriots across the aisle would love to deny it, the truth is that all of these problems will require the guiding hand of federal policy to be resolved.  Additionally, all of these will require serious investments of money, over a period of several years.  This is where the bailout of the financial institutions can be turned into a positive and proactive investment in our nations infrastructure.  I propose that those institutions planning to participate in the bailout, agree to repay the American people by submitting to a &ldquo;bailout tax&rdquo;, payable until at least 100% of their bailout credit has been compensated.   This tax would be for the express purpose of modernizing our infrastructure.  The exact projects pursued and the amount of the tax are of course subject to debate.  The advantages of this bill are several, the least of which is that these failed institutions can redeem themselves to the American people who they will owe so much. They will do this not only by repaying their debt in full, but by providing the investment for the infrastructure that will make America's economy strong in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  In the height of the Great Depression, this country offered its citizens a New Deal.  Now at the dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we can avoid another great economic recession by striking a new deal with Wall Street.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Americans, actions such as your proposed moratorium on foreclosures would be of great benefit to those left adrift in the midst of this crisis.  To prevent further abuses of wealth by corporate executives, a statute limiting a CEOs' total salary to a small percentage of the corporations' earnings for that year.  It is time to say goodbye to annual executive salaries ranging in the tens of millions of dollars while employees are forced to search for second jobs.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I thank you for your attention and your time.  I hope you will take what I have said into consideration, and that you will stand for what is right and fair for the American people.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Sincerely,</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">A.C. Tupper</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Atlanta, GA</p> </meta></meta></lj-cut><br /></meta></meta>"

Now that you've graduated from art school hell, do you think it was worth the money, the time and the energy?</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, yes i think it was. Perhaps not due much to the actual curriculum material I was exposed to, but instead to the culture itself. The fact that we knew we weren't being given a fair shake led me to believe firmly that we could do better, which led me to aggressively push myself outside of the curriculum. Before I went to AIA, my approach and attitude to art was at best hazy. Ironically, being at a shitty school crystallized my drive to be better than I think going to a top-flight art school would have.<br /><br /><b>2. You're far more political than I knew you to be. Which is cool. What are your ideologies and beliefs. Straight Democrat or a little something else?</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittedly I'm registered as a Democrat, but I'd like to think I'm thinking a few steps ahead of the party bloc. To that effect, I would say I tend to be more of a progressive than a progressive-leaning centrist. In all honesty I think I've calmed down a bit. I don't fantasize about doing violent things to conservative figureheads anymore, and try to focus on solutions which are fundamentally progressive, but aimed at helping anyone and everyone. I'm very concerned about our future, and while I'm not planning on having any offspring anytime soon, I worry greatly about the world we'll be giving the next generation, and to some extent, the world that they will give their kids.<br /><b><br />3. Have you found steady work in the field since graduating?</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, yes. There was a period there of around three months where I hadn't found anything, and I felt quite useless. However, in December last year I got snatched up by GoodEgg Studios, a small startup trying to make it big in the kid's virtual world market. Apparently, six months later, I'm considered one of their ""superstars."" I have my doubts as to my celestial place in the work environment, but the work is fairly rewarding and I don't have too many nervous breakdowns on the whole. Right now I'm officially a freelancer, although they have been making the noises that they want me permanently on the team for some time now. We'll see.<br /><b><br />4. Ever plan to move out of Atlanta?</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the grand scheme of things, yes. I am still at my core a harbor boy, and living in a city like Atlanta just doesn't cure that itch. In addition, I don't think I can really pursue my ambitions in the animation industry from here. The mass exodus of animation jobs from the West Coast might be coming, but I'm not sure I want to wait around for it. This isn't to say I'm chomping at the bit to move to LA, quite the contrary. I would be open to moving to the West Coast, but it would have to be in a less hectic locale, perhaps Portland, or San Diego. At this point I'm biding my time until after my current job launches their product.<br /><br /><b>5. You're originally from Maine. Was it a culture shock relocating below the Mason Dixon line?</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very much so. Before moving down South for college, I had traveled a bit and spent a few days in large cities (New York, Boston, Tokyo), but actually trying to accept Atlanta as my new home was quite a shock. Just the traffic itself was a shock. In Maine, traffic considered to be ""heavy"" is what the traffic we look forward to around midnight or later. There's simply just not that many people driving. Adjusting to the ""urban mindset"" was also a fairly big challenge, and I think still is a big challenge for me. As far as the shift in political mindsets, that was also a big hit, but admittedly one I had been preparing myself for. Ironically I think I managed to find one of the most radically different mindsets in Carrie's family, which has been a huge struggle for both of us, given our views."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my way to lunch today I saw something which honestly freaked me out.&nbsp; I work near a set of train tracks used regularly to move cargo.&nbsp; To get to lunch I have to drive over these tracks.&nbsp; Generally there's some generic-looking freight train parked or crawling along its merry way.&nbsp; Not today.&nbsp; There was a train parked beneath (at least as well as a quarter-mile long train can) the bridge with I kid you not, around 20 MA-1 Abrahms battle tanks, another 20 or so APC's and other assorted military hardware.&nbsp; I went back and took a look at it.&nbsp; I grew up next to a Navy base, so I'm used to seeing military hardware, but this was different somehow.&nbsp; Seeing all those tanks lined up was freaky, it felt...like a deadly calm.&nbsp; Its one thing when you see a video of a tank plowing through the countryside, I can't imagine seeing all of these in action at once.&nbsp; It would be terrifying, which I assume is the point, but holy fuck.&nbsp; From the markings I think they were part of the 68th.&nbsp; It makes me wonder, how many millions of tax payer's money was on that train?&nbsp; Probably enough to fund Atlanta's city budget for a year. &nbsp;

In retrospect I realize there wasn't even anyone around the train.&nbsp; It was just...left there.&nbsp; Which is a whole new level of freaky.&nbsp;&nbsp; It reminded me of some of the shots in Howl's Moving Castle with all the military hardware on trains."

"event","<p>I promised I'd fill in what I've been up to, and while the overall readership on this journal is somewhere in the single digits, I think it's probably a good idea to get in the habit of posting regularly.<br />
</p>
<p>First and foremost, I've graduated, which has been one of the more surreal experiences of my life.  I pretty much went straight from high school to college and plowed through a bachelor's degree in three years.  Now that I'm graduated, I feel sort of like an abandoned puppy. An abandoned puppy with a BFA.  It's odd, when I was finishing up the last quarter, I couldn't wait to get out so that I could focus on all the personal projects I've been toying with over the past few years.  Now that I am out, its shocking how fast listlessness can set in.  Now, there's a definite possibility that much of this perceived  inaction has been due to the fact that within a week of graduating, Carrie and I had packed up all of our stuff from the old townhouse apartment and had relocated it all to a one-bedroom loft just down the street.  Granted it wasn't a world shaking change, but it certainly has put a damper on things.  Things are looking up, however.  We've finally got the new apartment to the point where you can actually sit on the couch in something that is beginning to resemble a living room.  I'm looking forward to the ConceptArt Atlanta Ultimate Sketchbook Challenge this Saturday.  100 pages in under 24 hours. Rawk.  I've been dedicating a considerable amount of sketchbook time to developing the Scorch Sisters, and I'm hoping to jump back on the horse and finish the Kamikaze animation.  It'll look ten shades of badass if I can just see it through.  As for the Scorch Sisters, I'm split between making a promotional mini-story to get my feet wet, or to jump right into the storyline.</p>
<p>Carrie and I are also toying with doing a annual DVD animation collection of shorts to sell at cons.  They would consist of a variety of animated anthro shorts, from drama and action to comedy.  The DVD's would contain making-of material and other goodies.   I've bounced the idea off a couple other fellow animators, and most seem like they would be eager to help for a cut in the profits. At the moment we're thinking of having five pieces per release, each with a central genre or theme:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Comedy       Luls all around<br />
</li>
	<li>Drama        A chance to sink our teeth into some hardcore storytelling<br />
</li>
	<li>Action         Shinyness pretty much for shinyness's sake<br />
</li>
	<li>Romance        cute WTFery</li>
	<li>Music            An animated music video, preferably using fresh and original music</li>
</ol>
<p>While selling the DVD's will be the primary source of income, we're also considering auctioning off the opportunity to have one's character included in the cast.  Overall, this wll be a metric assload of work, that may indeed break my very soul, but on the other hand, the potential experience to be gained seems too tempting to pass up.</p>"

<p>It's a lecture at the Australian Film Television and Radio School by Mark Pesce back in 2005, before the debut of YouTube and Google Video.  It focuses primarily on BitTorrent, and how it represents the beginning of the end for the traditional network television model.  If you've got an eye towards future broadcast production, it's definitely worth an hour of your time.</p>"

"event","<p>I haven't updated in a while, I know.  I'll actually let people know what I'm up to in a while, but until then, here's a random segway.</p><br /><p>This might be old news, but I just stumbled across the <a href=""http://www.aptera.com"">Aptera</a> electric/hybrid car.  The website is frilly to the point of being ludicrous, but after doing some additional <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptera_hybrid_car"">research,</a> I'm rather impressed.  If the car can indeed attain anywhere near the claimed energy efficiency(fuel efficiency seems a bit outdated, now that we're taking about electric propulsion) for anywhere near the $20K price tag they're suggesting, they may have something on their hands.  I've always been a fanboy of the<a href=""http://www.xprize.org/""> X Prizes</a>, and I'm tickled pink to see people taking the initiative towards the Automotive  competition.   However, I have some observations to make that might make me sound a bit on the side of pretentious.</p><br /><p>First, the design reminds me very much of a much older design by <a href=""http://rqriley.com/"">R.Q. Riley</a>, the <a href=""http://rqriley.com/tri-mag.html"">Tri-Magnum.</a> I was quite taken with the design several years ago, and upon renewed inspection, Riley hasn't been <a href=""http://rqriley.com/xr3.htm"">resting on his laurels</a> in the <a href=""javascript:open_MediaPlayer('http://www.azcentral.com/phpAPP/multimedia/flash.php?path=rtmp://azcentral.com/news/0330altfuel5pm','mediaplayer','toolbar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,width=300,height=300')"">meantime.</a> I have to admit, I find it rather hypocritical for a man who has dedicated such a large portion of his life to building fuel-sippers to have a gas-hog like that Suburban parked out in front of his house.  Oh, and his website design is in desperate need of a renovation too.</p><br /><p>Secondly, While I love the streamlined look of these three-wheelers, there are certain pragmatic elements I feel that keep being overlooked.  The biggest issue is the fact that like the Honda insight, the two passenger design will severely limit the widespread appeal of the vehicle.  For those truly passionate about their impact, or about exotic car designs, it wont matter too much.  But many people, especially here in the good ol' USA, feel the need to be able to carry at least another two passengers worth of stuff, whether they be passengers or not.  Another element which may harm its widespread success is the fact that it looks so different from every other car.  This can be a good thing, yes, but again the herd mentality will naturally drive many people to buy cars which look just like everyone else's, despite the fact that they yearn to be different in some new and bold way. Shallow? Yes. Hypocritical? Most certainly.  Capable of being mitigated? With the right advertising, <a href=""http://www.glamourdog.com/hummer.html"">yes</a>.</p>"

"event","We finally have a stable internet connection.  After about two hours of struggling I got the new wireless router to make nice with the DSL modem.  It's yet to be determined whether this is going to be a good thing or just another distraction.


We came back from a late showing of Shrek 3 around 2am, which despite my misgivings actually may signify a slight improvement in Dreamwork's game plan.  The stars were out as we walked back into the house, and I couldn't help noting the poetic irony of the urban night sky.  Being from Maine I know there are stars beyond counting on a clear night, but down here I could have counted them with my shoes off.  The irony is this, as a society/people/civilization, we know there is so much more to be and to know, but because of where we are physically/geographically/socially/mentally we are kept from the truth.
  Am I advocating religious feverence?  No, I don't think so.  By that analogy, blind faith in religion would be like having but a handful of stars.  And for those who would skewer me for being a godless son-of-a-pig, I point out that a life with only science would be comprable.

Anyway enough musings."

"event","I've decided that it might actually be a good idea to start committing some of the more articulate ideas I've been gnawing on in my mind to this journal, so in the future expect to start seeing some actual journalistic quality.  But for now, we'll have some good ol' blogtastic rantyness.

   As many of you may be aware, I am an active follower and fan-boy of the open source software cause.  Those who know me personally have no doubt heard me ranting on one piece of open source or another.  The most common response I get is a roll of the eyes and a response that generally boils down to ""yeah, yeah, that's nice and all, but I'm only interested in <i>useful</i> software.""  I can say, with a fair deal of confidence, that there is very little reason to resist anymore.  Need Graphic design layout software but don't want to pay for Quark or InDesign? Try <a href="" http://www.scribus.net/"">Scribus</a>.  Love Microsoft Office (hey, someone has to) but hate the price tag every time the boys in Redmond add a new shiny?  Then get off your arse and get <a href=""www.openoffice.org/"">Open Office</a>.  You don't even have to migrate to Linux, even though the reasons not to are shrinking rapidly.  Many open source software projects are on Windows, although there's good reason to suspect they work better in their native Linux environment.  And as for Linux, come on people.  Yes, in the late 90's it <i>was</i> hard to install, and it <i>was</i> different from Windows, but with such easy and enjoyable linux distributions such as <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com"">Ubuntu</a>, the I-can't-use-Linux-'cause-I'm-not-a-nerd argument is getting old.  Even Second Life runs on it for pete's sake.  I could rattle off a good open source project for every conceivable need.  Have problems with color theory? There's a <a href=""http://home.gna.org/colorscheme/"">program</a> to help you with that.  Need a good calendar program that isn't dependent on Google? Mozilla (the friendly people who brought you Firefox) has <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/"">Sunbird</a> all warmed up just for you.

And for those of you too lazy to make the switch to Linux then download all the programs, Ubuntu just released <a href=""http://www.ubuntustudio.org/"">Ubuntu Studio</a> with everything <i>already there</i>.  Granted, because its so popular, it might be weeks before anyone can get back to the website.  

Now onto the Corporate Asshattery bit of this post.

Linden Labs, our friendly neighborhood developers of Second Life (a.k.a. Second Wife, MetaCrack, etc.) have gotten in their heads to commit sepukku.  They've decided that the only way to fight the ever-rising tide of pre-pubescent teeny-bopper-free-loader-griefers is, of course, to make everyone give up juicy slabs of personal information.  Like SSN's. And Driver Licences.  Apparently they've forgotten how to read their own Terms of Service, which in order to agree to, you must state that you are at least 18 years of age.  There has been much ""save the children!"" hullabaloo, to which I say screw the children.  To articulate, Second Life is meant for adults, period.  Kids are not supposed to be there.  If a kid agrees to that TOS agreement, he/she has waived their right to be considered an innocent.  Having gone through the same period myself, I can say that when a minor clicks through a 'must be this old to enter' page, they aren't doing it by accident.  They get, as I did, a good ol' dirty thrill out of it.  Linden Labs themselves are responsible for this mess. It was they who decided that the increased membership rush just felt too good to stop, so like any addict, they removed barriers in the way of their obtaining it.  By removing the credit card validation step, Linden Labs tied the cow to the railroad tracks.  Yes, teeny boppers can get credit cards, but they are <i>supposed to be</i> used under the watchful eyes of their parent/guardian/mushroom lord from Mars. That credit card validation was enough as history has shown to stem the flow of ickle innocent babylings onto the worlds biggest 3D smutroom.  
   Beyond the already twisted concept of the whole thing, Linden Labs have decided to add fuel to their pyre by using Integrity, an brand-new ID-verification subsidiary of Aristotle.  Aristotle's entire business plan revolves around collecting personal information about voters, and selling it to political groups.  A good deal of people find this rather alarming, it is one thing to give up one's personal information to a trusted source.  Giving personal information to a company who's big daddy <i>sells</i> that same kind of information, is a completely different matter!  Linden Labs has done little to none to shed any light on this and other concerns, merely repeating the same mantra in slightly different wording over and over and over... They have apparently turned a blind eye to many very large petition movements that have sprung up in opposition to the whole mess.

I could rant on this for another page or two but I'll leave that for a more calm and reasoned post later.


On a more personal note, I've begun a initiative to get Kamikaze done.  I mean done-done.  This week I will be finishing all of the remaining pencil tests, and next Saturday, the 26th, I will be holding what Carrie and I have lovingly dubbed C-Day.  Any veterans in the audience who remember our last push through cleanup effort may run away in terror, but fear not!  Unlike that little slice of animation hell, C-Day is all about having fun while we slave away at cleaning up our scratch-tastic pencil tests.  I'm planning on making it an all day thing with refreshments and entertainment (BRING ON ZE CLOWNEZ!!!   j/k).  I'll post more info when I make it up.

Anyhow, enough for now, I have a digital painting to finish.

"event","Alright, I know I haven't posted here in close to a month and nobody shy of Carrie and you read this.  Perhaps I'm just venting into cyberspace.  Who gives a shit.

What I logged on to say is that my patience for certain ex-roommates has worn slightly thin.  They move away without so much as a look back, clean out a good deal of our DVD collection (B-movie vampirotica DVD set does not equal special edition DVD's, 'kay?).  Carrie and I are still struggling with rent, if they thought it was bad BEFORE they moved out...Hooboy.

 I'm a huge fan of turning the other cheek but damn... Okay my childish inner gremlin is done.  He's going back in the cage with the pointy things. I swear.

In all honesty I hold nothing against them deciding to leave. I can even pass off the whole not staying in touch thing with bad communication skills (which I too am afflicted with, hence 2 journal entries).  It's just frustrating when you find out certain things you thought you had aren't actually there. That's all. 

In other news.

I've been an utter slacktard these past few weeks, it's sad really.  I was HOPING that without the menacing presence of such characters as Master Baker that I'd be able to pursue Kamikaze to the full extent of my hopes.  So far I've modeled at most 20% of what needs to be modeled and haven't even started on the cleanup. Instead of putting my money where my mouth is, I've wasted over three weeks on Katamari, Burnout, Killzone, and Guild Wars.  

Brilliant.

Maybe I write this shit as a verbal attack on myself. Maybe once I know that this shit's on the web it'll motivate me somehow.  Sorta like Opus Dei with a LJ account.  Fuck, I'm messed up.  

I've picked up NIN's new album, I like it for the most part, although I do tend to skip back to tracks 4 and 7.  

So I guess we can boil this article down to three major themes: Boohoo no more shiny DVD's, I suck at doing time management on my own (insert emo music here), and I'm just like every other anti-culture wannabe consumer sellout.

weee."

"event","Greetings all!&nbsp; This is the first post in this journal, Carrie finally seduced me over to the dark side of LJness.&nbsp; So now I, like many, many before me, shall proceed to flood the internets with the mediocre drivel which in some shape or form represents my life until such a time that I either forget my own password or die due to an overdose of caffeine.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

So, where to start. 

Spring break is whizzing by faster than a meth-powered freight train, but in spite of it's hasty pace I'm pleased to say I'm thoroughly enjoying sitting on my ass doing diddly-squat for once.&nbsp; Last quarter was one helluva ride, between Senior Project 2, Interactive Production, Independent Study, and Art History 3 with Kessenich, the sweetest sadist I have ever met.&nbsp; Towards the end getting two square meals (in this context meaning it comes from a square box delivered to our front door by some poor shmuck)&nbsp; and 3 hours a sleep in a 24 hour period was the equivalent of winning the jackpot.&nbsp; But now that it's over, I've turned my attentions to other things, like eating things which quite frankly probably truncate my lifespan considerably, sleeping until 2 in the afternoon, surfing the bowels of the internets with Carrie as my co-pilot, revitalizing my FurAffinity account, and waiting for the two guys I did a medical animation for to get around to paying me.

I've decided to take a sabbatical from the Kamikaze project during this break to focus on developing another series I've been toying with for a while.&nbsp; I've had an idea for a pulp-scifi Mike Mignola-meets-David Weber style graphic novel (read web comic)&nbsp; featuring two anthro dragons in space.&nbsp; Another way to look at it would be to take the movie Domino, give it a plot transplant, and then change the&nbsp; setting, the characters, and then make it a comic that for all intents-and-purposes is one huge fucking speed-painting.&nbsp; Needles to say there is still a lot of concept work to be done, but I'm hoping to have a prototype story printed and ready for test sales at RCFM.&nbsp; Given that this year's theme is sci-fi, I'm hoping it will do well.&nbsp; I'll be posting concept art on FA, and possible dA as well as things progress.&nbsp; 

Hmmm, I guess that's enough damage for a first post.&nbsp; I'll leave it at that for now."

I think i'm missing someone else though.

I might not move into the dorm till after my meeting with Josh monday afternoon because of the storm."

Work was amazing tonight, I found out that guy's name.&nbsp; His name is Brian, and all those people who he comes in with is his father and brothers and uncle.&nbsp; Yay, he's a family guy.&nbsp; So after I introduced myself when he came in, I asked the bartender Dee about him.&nbsp; Later on in the evening, she tells him the host was asking about him.&nbsp; He was taken aback I guess from what Dee had told me, but he said I was cute and that he would take me out, if he knew how old I was.&nbsp; Frick.&nbsp; He's 29, and I'm turning 21, so I don't know how he feels about it, but he did one of the servers who was 21.&nbsp; Umm, I didn't know a person could go to the bathroom 5 times in one hour.&nbsp; Dee asked him where he kept running off to, and he was like ""just checking some things off"".&nbsp; Yeah, I was sitting at the booth next to the bathroom each time.&nbsp; OK, i'm done now.&nbsp; Nothing's probably gonna happen, but it was just a nice night.&nbsp; Gonna go to bed, cause I have to get up early to go to training with Stef."

<P>A lot has happened over the few days, but nothing like the phone call i got tonight.&nbsp; As soon as i signed off the internet (which&nbsp;uses our 1 phone line) we got a call from my grandfather's&nbsp;hospital.&nbsp; my dad had a look of terror on his face when he saw the caller id.&nbsp; he answered the phone, and it was my grandfather, talking.&nbsp; He basically lost all of his speech, and has gone blind&nbsp;along with his other medical problems, but it was... i don't know... it was great to be able to talk to him for a few minutes, even though all he talked about was how he wants to&nbsp;go home, meaning heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's probably the calm before the storm, and he knows he's going soon and wanted to talk to us one last time.&nbsp; forgive me if i'm in a weird state of mind when school starts up, my mind's gonna be on him.</P>
<P>i can't express things through words, so i did a lot of choreographing tonight after that phone call.&nbsp; </P>

<P>It started last night when I met up with Colin, Michelle, Chelsea, Stef and Chris at Wooster St. in the Chester of Man.&nbsp; I'm not a fan of brick oven pizza, but Wooster St. has some kick ass pizza.&nbsp; Went back to New Britain and hung out&nbsp;with the boys of A12 and everyone else.&nbsp; Colin made another brilliant masterpiece which I think we should re-create in Maloney&nbsp;.&nbsp; After countless of hours laughing and watching anime cartoons and Newsies, I finally crashed on the couch at like 6 am.&nbsp; Jeff and I woke up at the same time around 9 30 cause we had to be at work this morning.&nbsp; Let me tell you, working 11 hours on little sleep knocks you right off your feet, but it was so worth it to spend one more night with Colin.</P>
<P>Gonna go to bed so I can get up early and make more money.&nbsp; YAY!!!</P>

"event","<P>So my insomnia has kicked in yet again, but it brought me to a new realization about my neighbor across the street. SHE'S INSANE!!!</P>
<P>Around 1 30 am I decided to just go inot the living room since I couldn't sleep.&nbsp; I just sat on the couch and took in the snow at night. It was actually really beautiful, I just stared out the window for half an hour, until something broke my concentration.&nbsp; I figure started making their way out of their driveway and started jogging at a slow speed, at 2 am.&nbsp; I thought to myself, ok well, she can't sleep either.&nbsp; She returned around 3 am from her jog, and was glad that she didn't get attacked by any animals. (We have a lot of coyotes in the winter)&nbsp; So I put in a movie around 3, Princess Diaries 2 to be exact.&nbsp; Then an hour into the movie, I see the same shadowy figure making their way down their driveway.&nbsp; It's 4 am and she's going jogging again.&nbsp; She returns around 5 am, at which point my mother is up and getting ready for work.&nbsp; So I told her about my observations, and she informed me that my neighbor does this EVERY single morning.&nbsp; Does she sleep? I'm convinced that she's not human, cause that's just not healthy, especially when you see her jogging at 9 pm every night too.</P>
<P>We had the Uno's holiday party at All-Stars in Manchester tuesday night.&nbsp; Not too much to tell except that the weather was horrible, and I was coasting on the highway and I was still sliding everywhere.</P>
<P>Wondering if that guy's gonna come in tonight?</P>

<P>Because they called me out of work yesterday, I watched some movies.&nbsp; Stepford Wives - it was so so, but I loved Roger Bart and Matthew Broderick.&nbsp; Raising Helen - heartwarming, but nothing really else.&nbsp; Saved - awesome movie cause I actually know kids and adults like the characters from the movie.&nbsp; It was just funny cause of all the personal parallels to it.&nbsp; I'm gonna watch Angels in America tonight cause I don't have HBO so I haven't seen it yet, read the play though. Oh yeah, and we rented The Day After Tomorrow, but i'm not in a hurry to see it.</P>

"event","<P>Found out Thursday that Mrs. Wallace died.&nbsp; She was only 49.&nbsp; I knew her first from her daughter Kelli in elementary school.&nbsp; Like all kids do, Kelli and I drifted apart, but I saw Mrs. Wallace everyday since she worked at school.&nbsp; She was awesome when it came to helping me with production stuff for the drama dept. and she would always come into the Red Onion to visit.&nbsp; I can't go to the wake or funeral cause I have to work since I didnt thursday due to my illness.&nbsp; This is certainly not the way their family should be spending the holidays.&nbsp; I will truly miss Lynn.</P>
<P>Went to Mike's last night to ring in the New Year.&nbsp; It was nice seeing Shelly, Mike, Matt, Tony, Jess, Bui, Drew, Kevin, Val,&nbsp;Brandon, Zaugg, Julie and then 15 other people that I had no clue who they were.&nbsp; Took some great pictures, I'll post some when I get back to school.&nbsp; We watched some Curb Your Enthusiasm for about an hour, had a little Spectrum reunion and sang ""Wassail"", got a nice little surprise from a friend, rang in the new year, and then I came home around 2 since I'm still in a lot of pain.&nbsp; Dina and Graham went away, so I'll see them later.</P>
<P>I don't really make resolutions, but after the tsunami and Lynn passing away, the only thing I'm gonna make a resolution for is to live each day to its fullest and always stay positive and optomistic.</P>
<P>Happy 2005 everyone.</P>"

"event","<P>So it was a spider that bit me.&nbsp; Don't know what kind, but because we have woods behind our house, we get quite a few in the basement during the winter months.&nbsp; Seeing as how I was downstairs barefoot Tuesday night, I think that's when it happened.</P>
<P>The ER doc put me on prednisone.&nbsp; It's helped quite a lot, but my legs and feet are still in so much pain, I can barely walk.&nbsp; Because of all my downtime today and Colin's party next week, it gave me an added incentive to do some reading.&nbsp; I think i'm gonna go as Jaime from A Walk to Remember.&nbsp; Not only is that my favorite character, but I've always felt that I resembled her the most, as far as personality goes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If I don't talk to or see any of you before 2005, Have a Happy New Year.</P>"

"event","<P>So now that I'm not under the movie's spell anymore, I can properly critique it.&nbsp; If you haven't seen it yet, you might not want to read this.</P>
<P>First off: The actors...</P>
<P>Minnie Driver plays a really good annoying diva.&nbsp; Even though Ms. Driver can sing in real life, it wasn't her singing in the movie.&nbsp; Her facial expressions alone made me laugh, she made it really easy to hate carlotta.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Emmy Rossum remember is only 18.&nbsp; I thought she did a fairly decent job playing Christine.&nbsp; She's definitly not the normal type to play that role, voice wise.&nbsp; It did seem though that she didn't change the look on her face much throughout the movie.&nbsp; For the most part, she played vulnerable very well.</P>
<P>Gerard Butler is by far the most seductive Phantom I have ever seen.&nbsp; I was impressed by his performance given the fact that he has never really sang before in his life.&nbsp; His performance was both hypnotizing and mesmerizing and any other adjective that describes one being under a trance.</P>
<P>I forget the actors name, but the guy who played Raoul was excellent.&nbsp; His voice was so smooth and clear.&nbsp; He played the part well, even if he seemed a little young.</P>
<P>Meg and Madame Giry were fairly good, though I think they could have sang better.&nbsp; But their characters are ballet dancers, not singers, so I guess that makes sense.</P>
<P>The costumes were AMAZING!&nbsp; I loved them so much.&nbsp; I think it also must be the time period because I love the fashion from the late 1800's.&nbsp; The Paris Opera house set was gorgeous, just because of the intricate detail of everything.&nbsp; The feel of the movie reminded me of Moulin Rouge a bit.</P>
<P>My only grip was that at certain points, the music didnt match the actors singing, especially in the masquerade scene, oh and I wish the phantom wore the Red Death mask.</P>
<P>The music was fantastic as always, but I didn't really listen to that original song in the end credits.</P>
<P>I liked how they explained how Erik (the phantom) came to live at the opera house and how they moved the chandelier scene from the end of the first act to right after Point of No Return.</P>
<P>Hope you all enjoyed the movie as much as I did.&nbsp; Time for work.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>"

"event","<P>I have been waiting for this day since I was 8.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I first saw Phantom at the Bushnell when I was 8, and have always had this odd obsession with the show.&nbsp; I so wanted it to be reality, and I wanted to grow up to be Christine in the worst way.&nbsp; I guess the 8 yr old that's still inside of me wants it to be true.</P>
<P>I've seen Phantom on stage 4 times, and each time hoped that it would be made into a movie so I can view it whenever I wanted.&nbsp; I'm gonna have to wait a few months before I can watch it as many times I want, but I got my wish.</P>
<P>I went to Plainville and met up with Kim, Andrea and Scott and saw the movie.&nbsp; OH MY GOD.&nbsp; </P>
<P>First off, to critique the actors, I think Emmy could have had a stronger voice, but Gerard Butler.&nbsp; That man has never really sang, and I was so impressed.&nbsp; He exuded so much sexuality and was just so seductive.&nbsp; I've told people time and time again, that if I was Christine, I would have stayed with the Phantom, but that's just me.</P>
<P>Sarah, after you see the Point of No Return scene, you'll understand exactly why I've said all of the things i've told you. </P>
<P>Ahh, I can almost die happy.</P>"

"event","<P>Thursday worked at Uno's.&nbsp; Hated it like usual.&nbsp; Then Leanne the manager scheduled me for thurs, fri, sat. nights and all day and all night sunday. shoot me now.&nbsp; Went to see Finding Neverland with the crew.&nbsp; Sean and Rob mooned people on the highway as we were stuck in traffic, kristin and sarah in manchester, and then rob mooned my car in the garage.&nbsp; good times.</P>
<P>Went home yesterday and made all the chocolate lolli-pops for EVERYONE!&nbsp; Came back here and chilled with the crew minus one.&nbsp; Went to Wendy's, then Barnes and Noble where I bought that America book, a new journal and theatre quote book.&nbsp; Then we went to D&amp;D and kept Sarah and Matt company.&nbsp; Went to bed at 4:30.</P>
<P>Woke up today @ 12 15.&nbsp; But I got a lot done.&nbsp; Went and saw Ocean's 12 with Colin and Rob.&nbsp; Colin invited John and Jojo, but I guess we're not good enough for them, so it was just the 3 of us.&nbsp; The movie was awesome.&nbsp; It's definitly one i'd go see again.&nbsp; Going to bed now, cause I have to get up at 7am to work all day and all night in hell.</P>"

"event","<P>So auditions were monday.&nbsp; I wasn't planning on auditioning for Quills, but after talking to Peter in the student center that morning, he convinced me to, so I did.&nbsp; I thought it went okay, I wasn't happy with it.&nbsp; Sat with Rochelle and John C in between things, and just the little chats that we had calmed my nerves significantly.&nbsp; Went in and had my musical audition.&nbsp; The musical director played my ballad way to fast and I couldn't keep up, but my up-tempo went well.&nbsp; Sue had me waltz around the room while singing.&nbsp; She told me to come back tuesday night.</P>
<P>Went to look at the callboard teus. and didn't get any other callbacks.&nbsp; I'd have at least liked to get one from Suessical, but I get a vibe from Jillian that she doesn't care for me much, so that may have been a factor.&nbsp; Went to the callbacks&nbsp;and did the dance routine.&nbsp; I&nbsp;proved to myself that it shows i've been out of practice for a while.&nbsp; Didn't get cut, so I stayed to sing.&nbsp; All the other groups sang songs from the show, and our group did scales, I was still hopeful though cause I really wanted to be in the show.&nbsp; Came back here and talked to John for a bit.&nbsp; He sat in on my Quills audition, so I just asked his opinion on what I could have done better.&nbsp; He just said to know the general atmosphere and an awareness of what was going on.&nbsp; So true, because I really didn't have a clue.</P>
<P>Wednesday - doom's day.&nbsp; I did my monologue and I felt really present with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was hoping it was a good sign.&nbsp; After class, went to look at the cast list and got my heart broken.&nbsp; I went back here and just broke down.&nbsp; I just felt so rejected.&nbsp; I feel like i'm not good at anything or good enough for anyone.&nbsp;Next semester I'm not going to be in ANY show, and it's just going to be so depressing sitting back and watch everyone else have fun.&nbsp;Then I was stressing out because the project I was up all night working on wasn't saving to a disk and I needed that powerpoint for my final speech that night.&nbsp; Went to take my religions test and failed it, partly because I didn't know anything, and partly because of the events that took place a few hours before.&nbsp; Did my speech and got an A.&nbsp; Ran to schlockdogs.&nbsp; I needed to laugh so bad after the day I had, it allowed me an hour to just forget about everything.&nbsp; Rehearsed my open scene with Kyle, but I feel like I'm sabotaging his chance to shine because I don't feel comfortable doing a certain scenario that Jeff and come up with.&nbsp; Got pizza and then wrote this huge entry that got deleted.</P>
<P>Today I have my last class with Moemeka before the final, then run home and do laundry, errands and work.&nbsp; Tomorrow i'm starting to bring some stuff back home and bake all day, but i'll be back fri. nite and sat. if anyone wants to do anything.&nbsp; Thanks to all of you who attempted to cheer me up yesterday.&nbsp; I truly am happy for all of you that got casted in a show, even though I may not show it right now. Oh, remind me that I need to get my container back from John and Evan's.</P>
<P>My cell phone doesn't work at home and I'm not online 24hrs, but I can't go a whole month without seeing all of you.&nbsp; If you want to reach me, my home # is (860)644-4433.</P>

"event","reading meghan's entry from yesterday, where she mentioned that yesterday had made 6 months since she'd been clean, i realized that also meant it had been 6 months [& a week] since pop pop died. half a fucking year. & it still seems like if i were to go to camden right now, he'd be there fishing or putting another model airplane in nana's house or just bullshitting around. & maybe it's because i've been drinking, but i miss him a whole fucking lot. & i still dont understand why it had to be him. why the fuck did he have to go trhough all that shit & all that fucdking pain & now hes gone? hes fucking gone & tanner doesnt get to have the awesome grandpa i had growing up. yeah maybe he was 24/7 drunk & smoking weed, but shit.. he was a shitload of a better tgrandpa than a lot of other people could ask for. i mean he wasnt constricted to a wheelchair, he took us fishing, & took so many cool ass pictures... plus he loved music too. idk. it just seems like god could've been a little more fucking considerate in choosing who the fuck had to get fucking cancer & die & leave 5 grandchildren who admired him behind, not to mention 2 daughters & a son, & a loving wife too. idk.

aloso i am tired of my fucking mom. & i hardcore wanna punch her in the face. she gets on my fuuuuuuckn ner ves & i cant deal with it for much longer, hence i am drunk at 4:30. i was gonna wait until tonight but she stressed me out so fuckin bad i had to start early. & well today is memorial day ?ithink or maybe its tomorrow. but we're cookin out& all that bullshit, which means ill be chillin in my room fucking drinking all day because well.. i dont wanna deal with my mom & her gay ass friends. plus she could be a little more considerate & give me a god damn ride to ayden so i dont have to be stuck in this hellhole all day. i just wnanna see my fuckin boyfriend & shit man.

PS yesterday i went to the beach & it wasnt as fun  asi i had planed on it being but it was ok
1. we left late due to some personal interaction w/kmart & the law
2. when we were finally about to leave, my fucking pothead friends were so insistent (real word? i dont think so.) on gettin fucking weed that we had to wait like another hour to leave
3. we didnt get to drink our fucking 36 beers we had;
4. they were in the trunk the whole time
5. & we didnt get to drink them on the bach either
6. which is why i have 12 beers in my bathroom right now.

bye."

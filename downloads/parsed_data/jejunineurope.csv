I've decided to make a travel blog. I'm not sure how much time I'll have on the internet, so this will be easier to keep in touch with everyone rather than sending out individual emails. Please email and comment excessively since it'll be nice to be reminded of home. :) fluffernutter44@hotmail.com or andrea.lee84@gmail.com

For non-LJ users, just click on the blue pencil and you can leave an anonymous comment. No need to sign up for Livejournal. But please leave your name in the anonymous comments. 

And since I'm writing this before I actually go, I should make this entry somewhat entertaining. 

Does anyone want me to take pictures of anything? Me with anyone? In some place? Doing something? Previous suggestions have been hot foreigners, me getting a piggy back ride, and me with my arm around the ugliest hooker in the Red Light District."

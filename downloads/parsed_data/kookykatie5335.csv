"event","Even though its a half day, im in a bad mood. IDK y, i just wanna rip somebody's head off! Not literally of course! I need some Orli, a phone call w/ a good friend, or a nice dinner. But I cant! Nobody's home so i cant use the phone, and theres no one here to make me a nice dinner. Oh well. I guess I'll just go express my feelings in a real diary becuz this one's public! See ya later.

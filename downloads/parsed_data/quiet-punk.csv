"event","I have pictures for this post, but since I used David's fancy-pants camera I can't upload them yet.

I finished getting the plants in today, 4 cucumbers, 3 jalapenos, 3 habanero, and 2 strawberries.&nbsp; 
When I was putting the strawberries in I thought, ""I should throw in those dead strawberry roots I bought earlier this month, let them fertilize the healthy ones.""&nbsp;&nbsp; See, I had planted the root bundles in old seedling containers, and they never grew any&nbsp; plants so I thought they were dead.&nbsp; When I dumped them out, I found 2 with growing roots and 5 with little plants than never made it through the soil.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got them in larger pots now, with little plants poking out.&nbsp; If they all come through I may need to get another strawberry pot!

The cucumbers finish out the line of vegetable, behind tomatoes and next to eggplants.&nbsp; The peppers have their container, as they are technically David's.&nbsp; I was through with peppers after the surprising yield last year that we are still working through.&nbsp; Yet when I asked him if he wanted me to plant anything for him he said he wanted his own container of jalapenos and habaneros.&nbsp; Perhaps keeping them next to the strawberries will keep the birds away.&nbsp; 

I also threw in some garlic, 4 cloves from the fridge that already had a little over an inch of green growing.&nbsp; Garlic is suppose to be planted in the fall, just before the first frost so it can incubate underground for a couple of months.&nbsp; I don't really expect to get any bulbs from this, but like many vegetables, there is more than one edible part of the plant.&nbsp; The flower and green parts of garlic are suppose have a very delicate flavor, and if the potatoes are any indicator, this store bought garlic will at least yield green parts.

"event","I'm not very good at keeping track of log books, and it looks like I'll need a reliable log for my garden this year.&nbsp; Hence, this journal.<br />It's at a new house, and as far as I know the soil has never been gardened before.&nbsp; I'm sending the soil in for testing tomorrow, but I've already planted a few things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though, I think I should start the story of my garden at the beginning, on the first weekend of May.&nbsp; <br />To start, here is the land: <br /><img width=""498"" height=""373"" alt="""" src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y3/quietpunk/IMG_0053.jpg"" /><br /><br />Not much, but I'm making the most of it.&nbsp; I'm also adding a lot of containers.&nbsp; The first of which is the herbs, which are growing on the front porch:<br /><img width=""554"" height=""415"" alt="""" src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y3/quietpunk/IMG_0059.jpg"" /><br />(That's basil, parsely, oregano, and cilantro.)  <br /><br />The next being the potatoes:<br /><img width=""495"" height=""371"" alt="""" src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y3/quietpunk/IMG_0060.jpg"" /><br /><br />The one on the left is a seed potato, the one on the right is an old potato that started growing so I just threw it in some dirt.&nbsp; From what I've been told, they make nice leaves but not many potatoes.<br /><br />I also tried to grow strawberries from a small box of roots that I bought at Home Depot.&nbsp; It didn't work.&nbsp; I didn't really expect it to, it just that since they are more of an early spring crop, I didn't think the nursery would have any.&nbsp; Turns out they do.&nbsp; Dirt cheap, a dollar for two plants.<br /><br />The following weekend, May 10, our landlord showed up to check the lock.&nbsp; When I mentioned the garden, he went back to his house and brought over 10 tomato seedlings and about as many swiss chard.&nbsp; The tomatoes are Rutgers, Big Boys, Ox Hearts, and something he called Grape Strawberry.&nbsp; They're suppose to be grape tomatoes that taste like strawberries.&nbsp; It should make for an interesting jam.&nbsp; <br /><br />After two weeks of heavy rain, the tomatoes are looking a little week, and some of the chard is dying.&nbsp; Part of that is my fault for planting them so close together.&nbsp; In that time though, I also managed to get another window box just for peppermint and a container for two onion sets.&nbsp; I have no clue how onions grow, and since I thought the price of one set was $1.25, I figured they must grow off of them like potatoes.&nbsp; As I watch them grow, I'm beginning to see the error of my ways.&nbsp; It was probably 5 for $1.25, and it looks like I'm only going to have two onions.<br /><br />A few days ago (20th) I was home sick and decided to walk to the nursery to pick up some more plants.&nbsp; I'm paranoid that if I don't get everything in by the end of may it won't grow, and it doesn't help any that the nursery is, litterally, two blocks from my house.&nbsp; I came back with some strawberries, eggplant and zucchini.<br /><br />Today I planted some sugar snap peas that I had grown from seed.&nbsp; I was very proud of myself for making a trellis out of an old piece of Dougie's cage.&nbsp; The english peas haven't grown tall enough, but when they do, they will join their sweeter cousins.&nbsp; This weekend should be the end of it, with me getting a container ready for those strawberries, planting a few cucumbers, and setting up a container of hot peppers for David.<br /><br />Updated pictures coming soon! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"

"event","It's a late night with no Dave, so naturally I can't sleep.  

I was browsing wikipedia when I found out that Semester at Sea has left Pitt, I gather at some point last year.  Okay so it's no big surprise that it took me this long to find that out, but it still feels weird when stuff here changes.  The parklet was okay, the American Apperal store I'm lukewarm about, I guess I still hoped that it would be a theatre again.

I'm trying to grow my hair out because I had bangs and hated them.  A few days ago Dave told me to go to a sylist and that he would pay.  Of course, he repharsed it as an option later, but I never know what to say in those situations.  I know my hair is a mess I just don't really care about it; but if  I say that to him he'll try to make me care and just leave me feeling insecure.  And he's one of those type, say one bad and it always comes up later: 
""We don't have to go out tonight""  
""No, you say we never go out, so we're going out""  
""I said that last year!""  
""So are you saying you're a liar?""
*sigh* I still miss him.

I started another cross stich.  Any bets on how long it will take me?  

I have to move the skulls in the dental school tomorrow.  Orginally they were going to go in the computer lab/study lounge, but I guess there wasn't enough room, because now they're going to the empty office across the hall.  Ideally, they're for public viewing, so students can look at all the cavities, overbite, and probably not notice at all that most of the skulls are from african americans with such interesting tags as ""hottontot"" and ""executed negro"".  For the record, the skulls were either donated by anthropologist or bought at curiosity shops, certainly not harvested or recruted from patients.  Or at least all evidence seems to point to that, all offcial records and personal information pertaining to the skulls has been long since lost or destroyed save the occasional tag.  One skull is green, I don't know what's up with that.  I'd be happy to give a tour if you're in the area.  Any way, I've have strayed from my first point of ""scientific racism"" and how looking at these skulls led me to look up human zoos.  I was surprised to see that there were numerous instances, and a bit of popularity, in the late 1800's of putting people kidnapped from colonies in zoo side by side with wild animals.  It's disturbing to think about.  

But again, I am rather late in learning of these things."

On the way to lunch I over heard two women complaining about transsexuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not because&nbsp;of their lifestyle choice, but&nbsp;because they thought the way some&nbsp;transsexuals&nbsp;dressed showed an unrealistic image&nbsp;of femininity.&nbsp; ""All that teased up&nbsp;Dolly Parton hair""&nbsp;

When conducting a research study involving young children, it is considered more favorable to compensate the child with something that will give them direct enjoyment (like a gift certificate to a toy store) than with money, since that will probably end&nbsp;up&nbsp;at the parents discretion."

Through the live journal ""candyisawesome"", I got a shipment of south american candy.  Combined with easter candy, hard candy i can never get rid of, and chocolate bars i buy and forget about, I have too much candy.  The south american stuff is kind of neat, one of the items was a piece of guava paste, which looked a lot like a squishy bit of hash.  It also wasn't labeled, there was just a note in the package.  David thinks it's all contaminated.  
On Sunday, I get to go to David's graduation.  Not really looking forward to it, as I didn't enjoy my graduation which he refused to go to.  It is different, they'll actually call his name and give him his diploma on stage.  It will also be a chance to see his whole family, watch them fight, and quickly run away.  
I don't know why, but part of me wants to see the scene his mother will inevitable make.  I know i'll hate it at the time and that I'll probably be too scared to really leave.  Like watching a car wreck, maybe?"

I got a new job at Pitt, in the Dental School, which has been cool and laid back so far.
everything else has relatively nifty, though I don't enjoy it much because I am often very tired.  
while walking by a church of science the other day, I began wondering if religion wasn't just a way for humans to justify their difference from animals.  Humans are here for pretty much the same reasons ferrets are here, chance evolution.  Humans reached a point, though, where they dramatically started altering their environment negating evolution and adaptation to a degree.  why not the ferrets?  Why did humans get this self descrutive bend while ferrets still hop around and eat prairie dogs?  Then again, even when one rejects religion, they don't go completely feral.  To be an animal would mean rejecting all of history and art and most people seem unwilling to do so.  My mind wanders too much.
For the price of 20 new bunnies, I got my rabbit spayed.  She's been pretty good since then, not attaching me or growling at me.

When I got back to the lab I started looking up books on how to teach a kid good manner.  There are so many of them!  Only a few directed at the kids, most are for the parents.  There's potential to reach a conclusion about a growing ruder society, but Emily Post has been around a while.  I still think guilt and hellfire is a good way to get kids to straighten up, but with antheists, I don't know.

It's not even a good Norton's one, just Barnes and Nobles.  I would have traded, but most of the class had already said they hated poetry.  And come on, you really can't trade up with that."

Then it got into this poorly played happy second part, then it got to the third part and I realized this is the Beethoven song.  You know, when ever shows talk about classic music they all play the same tune by the person because everyone already knows it.  Beethoven's is the third movement of Moonlight Sonata.  Ode to Joy stands alone.

He's small, soft, grey and scared to death of me!
Dave it got for me, partly for valentines, partly because he thinks I'm lonely too much.  It's a hard critter to warm up to.  It doesn't bit or scratch so much, but every time I leave it out of the cage it leaves pellets all over the floor.  I haven't much choice in though, it's not healthy to leave it in a cage all day.  Different websites say they get over that as they learn the limits of their territory.  He's also addicted to his water bottle.  I added this vitamin C supplement to it, so maybe that makes it taste sweet or something.  He just gnaws at all day.  And he's box trained.  I had no idea that bunnies used litter boxes, but apparently they do; to a extent though.  
I named him Douglas, because I like the name and because it's Dave's middle name.
If I figure out how to post pictures, I'll be sure to put his up."

I turned in my first paper for fiction yesterday, after a week of much ""what the hell am I doing in this class?""  It still wasn't a good paper, but ofter reviewing some other ones in the class, I know it wasn't hte worst.  We had to review one by the adult student in the class, a 60 year old polish woman.  Her essay was a static, simplistic presentation of living through Warsaw during Nazi occupation, with syntax that would make a 8th grader cringe.  At first I wrote this off to her not knowing english too well.  But by the end of the essay I find out she has been living in America for 40 years and she has a master's degree.  So annoying.  Downright painful essay.  But I know, next class when I have to criticize her to her face she's going to give everybody that ""I'm old and she's hurting me, why?"" look and I'll look evil because that's not going to stop me from saying ""you waste my time! half of this essay is completely useless information!""

It always goes the same way, she's yelling about something so loud people I'm talking to on the phone can hear her, and if he responds it's not audible.  I think it's in chinese, but I've never been good with languages.  Last night was a peak though, she just started screaming.  Not ""stop hitting me"" screams, long loud ""I'm fucking sick of this"" screams.  I wondered if I should call the police and report a domestic disturbance, like they alway do in sitcoms during abuse awareness week.  But as far as I can tell she wasn't being physically hurt.  And I don't know these people.  Of all the ways to meet your neighbor, calling the police on them is probable one of the worst.  Though, in college town probable fairly common.  Of course, if it is just her being sick of him but not wanting to leave for some reason, police intervention won't help   
Seems like whenever I try to live alone, someone is always screaming at my doorstep."

I've been surprisingly productive in the past few days.  Productive, in my definition, are actions that contribute to self-improvement.  So while I have nothing tangible to show for my nights of reading/exercising, I am a little stretchy-er.
WQED had been playing christmas carols and classical renditions of christmas carols which is only sort of annoying.

"event","The other day I was sipping a cup of coffee as NPR rattled off the headline for the day: ""a plague of locusts is devouring crops in Senegal and West Africa.  This is Morning Edition"".  My initial reaction was ""what, just one headline?"" quickly followed by ""a plague of locusts? Like in the biblical sense?"".  
I assumed these sorts of things happen all the time, and that it wasn't that serious.  Today I find out I was half right, these plagues are regular enough to be predicted and prevented, however, most nations were not willing to give aid to pre-empt the onslaught, resulting in 90% crop destruction (the number probably a mistake on my part).  The UN is currently deploying food aid and insecticide.
Someone has to say it: So we'll make a pre-emptive strike against possible military threats but not againt actual humanitarian threats.
So I got a hair cut recently.  An actual haircut too,  chopped off to the shoulders and bangs hanging down in the front.  I wasn't too pleased, but nothing I can do about it now.  I had just assumed that when I walked into a salon and said ""I want it short, what do you suggest?"" the stylist would be excited, take advantage of a 'blank canvas', and rattle off many suggestions.  Instead she was confused and kept saying, ""so what do you want? do you want layers?""  It had been Dave's idea that I go to a salon and pay a lot of money to get it professionally styled.  A week or two before he talked his sister into taking me shopping for more feminine clothes.  He seems convinced that if he can make me look like a beautiful women in the conventional sense I'll be happier with myself and more inclined to take some initiative in my life.  A noble effort, but I still say fuck that, I just feel like a phony.  And of course, I can say that without reply as he is morally oppose to livejournals(""they're too self-indulgent"") and doesn't read mine.
Got an interview with PittMed, went, bombed it, but it dosen't really matter since they were looking for someone with more experience anyway.
I've been working at the Three Rivers Review this semester, and dispite the fact that it has made the glaring fact that I can't write all the more clear, I'm planning on reading at the release party.  It's something I've always wanted to do but have been a little afraid to.  Dave had given me the impression that he would read, so I thought I'd have a solidarity/support base this time.  When asked, he declined (""my stuff is too personal for this crowd""), and I immediately wanted to get out of it.  I suppose I should, I really can't that well and I haven't anything really prepared.  Grrr.  Regardless and certainly, everyone on the list is invited: Monday the 22 at 9o'clock, at Hemingway's, free food (vegetarian provided) but you have to pay for the drinks.
I feel like I've bad mouthed Dave too much in this e-mail, but I think that's more a reflection of how much he's become a part of my life than any sort of dislike.  We had a lovely time this weekend, just hanging out an cuddling.  Early on he had given me a plain chain that had some meaning to him for me to wear as a reminder.  I thought that was cute and did until I lost it about three weeks ago.  I havn't stopped looking for it since, despite him saying it's not important.  Saturday he gave me a necklace with a heart shaped pendant, pink sapphires set in white gold, to replace the function of the plain chain: a daily reminder that he loves me.  
Still, a freaking plague of locusts!  Is it even on the news?"

"event","So after much prodding by others and a little by myself I finally made some motions towards career searching in writing.  My discoveries: 1)most schools do not offer degrees in technical writing, but rather join it with business writing under the title ""professional communications"", except this little school in Philadelphia that seem quite proud of its biomedical writing program.  2)It is still possible to get an internship with PittMed, though too late to use my ""well I was talking with your boss..."" line.  I'm not sure what kind of writing samples they want, but I know a few good people I can ask.  3) Pitt offers no classes in 'technical' writing, tempting me to look into classes on how to write art reviews.  Though, perhaps the advisors can fill me in if professional writing would be better.  Man, I should totally call Post-Gazette or the like and see if they accept free-lance theatre reviews.  Good thinking live journal!
Been a bland day besides that.  I'm fixing to go vote after work, which entails going out to the Municipal building in Hankey Farms over in Imperial.  And, like many who will be reading this, I will chose the lesser of two evils.  Voting just gets more demoralizing every 4 year.  Perhaps I should start giving a damn about local politics.  We all found it kind of funny, the representative for Fayette Township, Mr. Pippy, was called into training for military service just as he began his campaign.  His wife and friends ran the campaign for him, and he won.  Served his time in Iraq to.  The idea of not be present for your own rallies and the like strikes me as amusing.
But I don'd know about Kerry.  Certainly, anybody would do a better job than Bush, but Kerry is going to be a mouthpiece for the modern democratic party, which has eroding into the old republican party.  Though considering the modern republican party has degraded into a ""movement toward regression"" perhaps I shouldn't complain.  Ah well, sayeth the cynic, Kerry/Edwards in '04, Bush/Cheney in the lower circles of hell."

"event","when i walked out of my building today, i looked up and saw a black stripe of birds.  For a good 2 to 3 seconds there were enough birds to form a band in the patch of sky between my building and the one next to it.  I'm truly curious as to what prompted it, and whether it happens often or not."

"event","so who all has heard about the voter fraud carried out by some creative republicans?  A few people posing as marijuana advocates were asking people to sign a rather detailed petition for legalization.  Actually, they were voter registation change of address forms.  They then filled in a random district, changed the affiliation to republican, and turned in the forms.  So now, if said signer goes to vote at his usual location, he will be denied.  As clever/stupid as this sounds, I actually know somebody who got taken in by it, one of the staff members at three rivers review.  I can't remember his real name, so lets call him Rick.  
Now Lauren, one of the editors, pointed out to Rick, how stupid it was to give that much information for a legalize it petition.  Pleading a general weakness to weed, he related another story to reinforce this.  One day, he decided to take the stairs to his apartment rather than the elevator.  In the stairwell, he came upon a small bag of marijuana.  Thinking it a bit of providence for having made a healthy choice, he decided to smoke it, and ended up in the emergency room.  Seems it was laced with some sort of amphetamine.    
He thinks it's a conspiracy.  
We all thought he needs to lay off the pipe."

"event","I got to work early with the intention of finishing a story that's due today.  Didn't happen, I perpetuated an old search instead.  
When I was really young I can remember my mother singing a song to me about penny candy and an irish family falling into poverty, but there's still hope cause the mother has a penny for the kid.  A vague recollection of the tune and one verse is all I had, but through a recent series of events (are details really neccesay?) I deduced some new leads and finally found the song: Coulter's Candy.  Apparently an old irish folk song.  The lyrics aren't quite what I remember, I can tell there are places where she must have changed the words.  
It's weird to think how distant the past is.  Or maybe it's just me.  Maybe I push the past away too much, focus so much on living now that I forget how I lived then.  It's like other people can go at length about their favorite Christmas, family gatherings, their first kiss, or other classic memorabe events, and I can bearly recally what I did last year.  Would this help explain my feeling of lack of self, that feeling like there are no unique charachters that define me as an individual?  Am I reading too much into this?  Will I get another comment about this being too sad?
ah well.
Poor wee soul, you're lookin' very thin
A puckle of bones covered over with skin
Now you're gettin' a wee double chin
From eatin' Coulter's candy"

"event","so Melissa suggested I started a live journal, and since all my creative efforts of current are going towards writing bad poetry, I figure why not?
I went to a poetry reading last night at Kiva Han.  It was pretty clicky in that ""were all english majors and we rule"" sort of way.  They called Dave ""neuroscience boy"".  They ignored me, as I pretty much did the same to them.  They had some pretty good stuff, much better than I expected.  Part of me wanted to go home and fill a blank book, but the majority of me realized that wouldn't be worth it.  Dave was certianly inspired, which is good since he was bitching a few days ago about not being able to write.
I tried to write some poems about my outlook on live, but they were all pretty grim.  I don't know what's wrong with me lately, i've felt okay, but I keep haveing really sad thought.  I think it's just me returning to a normative state of slightly higher depression than optimism.  You know, normal.
Damn, I should go write in my real journal.  Or at least leave work.  Do homework.  Have some candy.  All that good stuff."

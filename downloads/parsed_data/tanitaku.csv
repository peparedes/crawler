A guy walked past me today with the same smell and I turned around thinking it was you. It wasn't. I ended up just standing there watching that guy walk away because I didn't know what to do with myself. 

I hate that I miss that smell and I hate how I remember it still.

OKay well I hope everything goes well and I don't get utterly humiliated becasue I'm afraid of those hieght things they make you do. Also, it will be pretty embarrasing because a lot of my sister's friends are camp helper people and I bet they heard a bunch of UGH stories from her about me. Yuck. 

Also, I must know everyone's classes to see if we are together. Well, I think that will be too long so instead just tell me when you have PE, I don't have anyone in my PE class so far and I need a buddy or else my second semester will suck. I have it like first class everyday second semester. It's really horrible, getting gross and sticky in the begining of the day.

In practice he makes these faces if we don't do it correctly in which turn makes me laugh and then I squeak, which then makes him put on a even more messed up face and about then I jut crack up....I'm screwed...I'm right in the front too, well not really, but to the side on the right, but you can see my whole body! UGH!

Also, we are like playing 5 fucking pieces and I don't have enough air in me to sustain that fucking long. 

Another thing, the low people (me, bassoon, tuba, bari-sax) can't count because we ""Don't think, god, people, practice is for getting better, not screwing up everything!"" as said by Graser. 

Tomorrow I also have to present my math lesson which is going to be bitch.

Ew. I am going to be such a dork entering 9th grade. Braces + Glasses + No-sense of style= Horrible 9th grade year. 

2. Gotta do my band test thingy today because I am getting braces tomorrow. 
FUCK! It is so fucking fast, the time signature is 6/8 and we have to play it at 100. FUCK!!!! FUCK!! FUCK!!!

3. Got a french test tomorrow
You all know test are meanies. ><

4. Lost my house keys
Now I have to hang out with my dad downstairs until my sisters come. He's not bad, but he can't watch 1 channel on TV, he filps them every second, which is really distracting. 

5. I have to go to the french contest test on saturday. I'm gonna fail. 
GOD! To get a medal you can only get 9 wrong, that's how much I get wrong on the listening alone. These are the categories, Listening/Passage, Listening, Writing, Best choice, I get at least 2 wrong in every section. EW. 

Also! Go on youtube and watch ""Lovely Complex"" it's a Jmovie with Teppie, he is so cute! Really funny cute movie."

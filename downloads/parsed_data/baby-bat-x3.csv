I had fun there

Amanda doesn't talk to me anymore and I just want things to be like they used to be.

And I looked at pictures of when we were babies and we had so much fun.

And I think that it's my fault and im being dumb because I just keep asking her to talk to me.

And if she doesn't want to I shouldnt force her right?

But I dont know what to do.

Then I fed him 15 calcium coated crickets.

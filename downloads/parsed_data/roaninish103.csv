Her Green plastic watering can
 For her fake chinese rubber plant
 In fake plastic earth.
 That she bought from a rubber man
 In a town full of rubber plans.
 Just to get rid of itself.
 And It Wears Her Out, it wears her out
 It wears her out, it wears her out.
 
 She lives with a broken man
 A cracked polystyrene man
 Who just crumbles and burns.
 He used to do surgery
 For girls in the eighties
 But gravity always wins.
 And It Wears Him Out, it wears him out
 It wears him out, it wears him out.
 
 She looks like the real thing
 She tastes like the real thing
 My Fake Plastic Love.
 But I can't help the feeling
 I could blow through the ceiling
 If I just turn and run
 And It Wears Me Out, it wears me out
 It wears me out, it wears me out.
 
 And if I could BE who you wanted
 If I could BE who you wanted,
 All the time, all the time, ohhh... ohh."

"event","Such a terrible day...I need someone to come and cheer me up... I don't feel like talking so I am putting up song lyrics..

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven
  And when she gets there she knows if the stores are closed
  With a word she can get what she came for
  

 Woe oh oh oh oh oh
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven  

 There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
  And you know sometimes words have two meanings
  In the tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven  

 Woe oh oh oh oh oh
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven  

 There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
  And my spirit is crying for leaving
  In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
  And the voices of those who stand looking  

 Woe oh oh oh oh oh
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven  

 And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
  Then the piper will lead us to reason
  And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
  And the forest will echo with laughter  

 And it makes me wonder  

 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
  Don't be alarmed now
  It's just a spring clean for the May Queen  

 Yes there are two paths you can go by
  but in the long run
  There's still time to change the road you're on  

 Your head is humming and it won't go because you don't know
  The piper's calling you to join him
  Dear lady can't you hear the wind blow and did you know
  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind  

 And as we wind on down the road
  Our shadows taller than our souls
  There walks a lady we all know
  Who shines white light and wants to show
  How everything still turns to gold
  And if you listen very hard
  The tune will come to you at last
  When all are one and one is all
  To be a rock and not to roll
  Woe oh oh oh oh oh
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven  

 There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven
  And when she gets there she knows if the stores are closed
  With a word she can get what she came for
  

 And she's buying a stairway to heaven, uh uh uh."

"event","Well, I don't know why I got this journal. It will probably be boring, and I doubt anyone will read it. I will fill out some surveys to make it a little more interesting..Anyways, my day went well. I had to deal with my grandparents, which is never fun. I have been on the computer for about 6 hours talking to people. I'll post something more interesting later tonight."

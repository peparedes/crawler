"event","hey there.... well, i am finally back from point for the weekend only to return on monday. but luckily, tis my last week there. NO MORE LIVING OUT OF A SUITCASE ALL FRICKEN WEEK!!! well, its been a pretty not-to-good week. my mom needs surgery again this monday, and my clinical instructor is pissing me off. i think our auras just clash (nice detail becky). anyways, im hungry now. i had a pack of crackers i took from the front all day. and a candy cane. the rest i smoked (cigs). im just sitting here being bored in the computer lab at school thinking i should probably get to doing my paper that was due last week. oh well. i went shopping in point yesterday and found some cute care bear flip flops. i am terribly addicted to flip flops... i have like ten pairs. i hate shoes so i wear the least amount of shoe possible... even in this five inches of snow. crazy, no? anyways, i found a really cool store to that sold like astrology stuff and wiccan stuff, and buddhist, and all this cool imported stuff. i got a quartz crystal and a rose quartz crystal. i like believing in all that. they help you with life and all the crap you get living it. so that was good... well, back to being bored.

"event","well, g'day there to the maybe one person out there that might actually read this. its finally the weekend!!! hoorah!!! had a pretty crappy day. a test i never actually studied for, pretty good week at clinicals considering the place, and YAHOO RADIO WILL NOT STOP SKIPPING!!!! GRRRAAHH!!!!! oh well, ill live. since no one on here knows anything about me, ill start of with that. im nineteen and have about a quarter left of my college. im training to be a surgical technologist. fun stuff!! im still thinking about nursing though. but the waiting list for that really sucks here... im not sure about the other states, but i really dont feel like paying out of state tuition either. im female (incase none of you have noticed by my writing style). im also hugely addicted to anime. YAY!!!! im going to my first ever anime convention in wisconsin in about thirteen days. going as kagome from inuyasha. we have a kagome, an inu, a kikyo, and a miroku in our group so far. the costume turned out excellent!! you guys should see the bow and arrows i made from scratch!! im so proud of myself for them!!! but if anyone reads these and gets sick of me counting down the days, then TOUGH!!! KAH!! i think i look like a major dork now... im in our computer lab at school now and talking to myself and being a nutcase while i type... so i dont think they think im all there. do any of you watch one tree hill out there? i just got addicted to that one... and angel... and charmed. i love all that supernatural stuff... was/am a huge x-files fan in the day before they left. 
lemme see, what else do i have to say... red vines are good... i like them... i should get some... oh! i also write some fanfics, they're all inuyasha based so far, so if youre a fan and need something to do to kill some time, here is the address... fanfiction.net  my username is kyokukou_gackt... so come and visit sometime. i love gackt to if you didnt notice. okay okay.. more like a mild obsession.  
well, i havent got much to say right now... tis been the average boring day. so ja ne and have a good weekend. enjoy your youth and high school years while you all can!!!!"

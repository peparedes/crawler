You wonder how I'm doing, how I'm holding up since you did me wrong

Well, how am I doing since you did, what you've done to me
I can't lie, I sometimes cry, when I think of how it used to be 
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy, and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm since you did, what you done to me

Well, now wait one minute, I failed to mention, those tears I cried were tears of joy
Because, it was no fun, there under your thumb, and now that we're done
I'm getting right, every night, with every single, every lovin girl in sight 

So, how am I doing since you did, what you've done to me
I can't lie, I sometimes cry, when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy, and I don't get much sleep 
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did, what you done to me

Well, when all friends heard, what a you know what you were
They took me out on the town
But then I heard our song, and I danced along, but it felt all wrong
Cause she was sweet, she let me lead, she never took her ever lovin eyes off me

So, how am I doing since you did, what you've done to me
I can't lie, I somtimes cry, when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy, and I don't get much sleep 
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did, what you done to me

Well, I don't know what you were thinking, running round on me
Now you say your sorry.....well honey I agree

So, how are you doing since you did, what you've done to me
Girl don't lie, I know you cried, cause you know how good it used to be
Yeah tell me does the thought, of loosing my true love, make it hard to sleep
Baby, how are you doing since you did, what you done to me.

Now how are you doing, now that you know, how I'm doing, 
since you did what you done to me"

I'm gonna drive on out to the river tonight 
Find a quiet spot, turn on my parking lights 
I'm gonna drink some beers, try to catch a buzz 
Turn my radio up and forget about us 

I'm gonna lay me down on the hood of this car 
Make another wish upon a falling star 
I'm gonna think again about the way it was 
I'm gonna close my eyes and forget about us 

I know it won't be easy but I've got a plan 
To just let my memory let go of your hand 
I'm gonna miss your touch 
But I know I must forget about us 

And when the morning sun burns across my face 
I'll put my shirt back on, get up and walk away 
I'm gonna climb my frame onto a Greyhound bus 
Take a little blue pill and forget about us 

I know it won't be easy but I've got a plan 
To just let my memory let go of your hand 
I'm gonna miss your touch 
But I know I must forget about us 

(Spoken): 
By the time I get to Phoenix, I won't know your name 
Those soft green eyes, your warm skin 
And the way you say ""Good morning"" 
I'll be alright"

he said that he doesnt want to su her but he is only takin her to court if she tries takin austin and caitlin with her cause my dad doesnt want to lose custody of his kids. 

my dad said that he wont take her to court but if she tries takin him to court then he will spend every penny he has to fight for custody.

this is turned into a bunch of crap.

sister and brother make things sound twice as worse than they really are because they are mad at my dad for not lettin them move

they hate katy carter and evelyn for stupid reasons.

i personally think that they hate them because they feel like my dad loves evelyn and katy and carter more then them.

they feel like just because my dad doesnt love my mom any more they feel like he doesnt love them any more and doesnt care about them.

omg i hate this so much!"

if you have never walked a step in my shoes
you dont know me or what ive been though
so just listen to me before you judge me like you do
my parents are divorced and i hate my life
and you will probably say im not the only one
well my life has changed in just the past few months
it all started as my life was going good
my summer was goin great until that night of fear and tears
the one i loved called me that night
and didnt even care to live his life
he was so far away and there was nothing i could do
except sit there and pray 
that his life would not go away
i konw many of you has lost a mom dad or friend
and some of them you didnt even know it was gonna happen 
so there wasnt anything you couldve done
but its different when you know
and theres nothing you can do
i got lucky that night that the gun didnt get fired
and i thank god that hes still here
ive had friends that have tried to O.D.
and their very lucky they didnt end up with a sign that said R.I.P
im scared of death
and im scared of pain
i fell heart broken 
and i feel so ashamed
some night i cry because of what people say
but i act as if it doesnt bother me the next day
i fell like everyone hates me 
and that i dont belong
everyone is two faced rude and wrong
why cant like fe simple and dreams come true
why cant everyone be honest and sincere
people talk about me and then they act as my friend 
they say things about me that shouldnt be said
im just a part of their amusement and enjoyment
please just tell me why you judgne me like you do
has this ever happened to you?
i cry at night because of things i did
i mean yeah it was great i aint gonna lie
but now that i think about it maybe it shouldve waited
ive made mistakes and other people have payed the price
its not their fault 
im the one to blame
i alwyas seem to say the wrong things at all the right times
and it probably gets people wonderin about me
you are to blame for some of this pain 
and i hope one day you'll think twice before judging one day
because soon yourself will be judged too
and it will be too late to say "" have you ever walked in my shoes?""

"event","well we started packin some things .... i guess im movin soon. 
i dunno what im gonna do bout school.. its either move to houstin with my mom or go to mansfield for a year and then go back to homeschoolin, which is what i wanna do. 
i dont want to go to houston. 
and maybe it would be a good thing if i went to mansfield schools for a year that way i woudl be away from midlothian and all the ppl that hate me wouldnt have to see me roudn school or nuthin...and then when i go back so homeschoolin i will be completly outa their lifes. 
they might actually like it: like the fact that stupid ol april aint around....and maybe they wont want me gone since im just their huge fun of entertainment! 
its really nice to know that everyone has a huge blast laughin at me and sayin crap bout me.
more than half the ppl that say stuff bout me dont even have the right to be sayin stuff bout me cause they dont even know me. yeah they probably know who i am but they dont know me and havent gotten the chance to get to know the real me. 

so maybe i should just leave...
this is all a bunch of crap. really it is. my life is so screwed up right now and i hate it. my life has changed from very recent events...not that anyone cares... but if anyone has noticed
1. im not the same person since a certain someone tried to kill himself. 
that person didnt realize how much he would totally ruin someones life by callin that person and tellin her that he is gonna kill himself. its very scary when your boyfriend calls you night and tells you that he has drinkin a whole bottle of whiskey and that he has a pistol in his hand and is wantin to shoot himself.
he says things like "" but im gonna be with my dad""
""im so sorry....im so sorry...im sooo sorry""
its a scary feeling when you know that that is about to happen any moment and there is nothin in the whole world that you can do about it. knowing that he is thousands of miles away and you cant stop it. knowing that your about to lose someone you really care about.
i mean its different not knowing that that person is about to die and not knowing that there is something you can do to prevent it. thats different
i know that im not teh same person since that happened and even my friends have told me (the ones who know about that).

im tired of always gettin people in trouble and gettin myself into troubel because of stupid mistakes that i make. 
and actually its mostly other ppl that are gettin in trouble and not me. i hate it and i really dont mean to get other ppl in trouble... i really really dont mean it. and im sorry to everyone that i have gotten in trouble."

you cant chose when it rains or snows

you cant make someone trust you
but you can do your best to make yourself a trustworthy person
you cant stop rumors from being spread

you cnat make someone go to church or to believe in God
but you can tell others about God and invite them to church
God is the only one who can do anything and everything but because he chose the nails for you, you can chose...
he doesnt make you love him or others
but he could
he wants you to make your own decisions and he wants you to know right from wrong
even though there are things in life that you cant always do
there are so many things you can do that makes a diference in your life and other.

the only thing is that it is a game never won or lost
during a lifetime so many dreams are dreamt
and so many are lost
people get so caught in their dreams and fantasies
that they get heartbroken with reality
as life goes on many hearts are broken
and many are mended by someone new.

then you would see
how much i miss you
and how long ive cried
i dont what your thinkin now
and the past three months have seemed so fake
were the just pretend,
or were we really there?

i need you more now than ever before
i wish i could have said goodbye
and i really need you here with me
i wish you could see how much i miss you baby

why are we so far apart?
we dont hardly talk anymore
i thought we knew what we were
i cant see clear anymore
you dont seem to care right now
but then im not sure

i need you more now then ever before
i wish i could have said goodbye
and i really need you here with me
i wish you could see how much i miss you baby

i see you in my dreams
but i wake knowing you arent there
i cry at the thought of you
and i hear you voice in the back of my head
i just want you here so bad
to come back and never leave again

i need you more now than ever before
i wish i could have said goodbye
and i really need you here with me
i wish you could see how much i need you baby

and now i dont know 
what to think or how to feel
the only thing i know is that i love you still
i pray at night that soon you'll near
and that you dont spend forever away form me

i need you more now than ever before
even thought it hurts to think of you anymore...

You're always crazy like that.
And I watched from my window,
Always felt I was outside looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather.

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well in case you failed to notice,
In case you failed to see,
This is my heart bleeding before you,
This is me down on my knees, and...

[Chorus]
These foolish games are tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart.
You're always brilliant in the morning,
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee.
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you.
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar.

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else,
Somebody who gave a d**n,
Somebody more like myself.

[Chorus]
You took your coat off,
Stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that."

la la la la lala la la la la la la la 

The rumors flew but nobody know how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away is memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

"event","Sometimes no matter how much you want to or feel like you need to forget people that you have been with it is very hard. Right now it actualy is impossible to do. I talked on the phone to Josh for like and hour in a half last night and we were talkin bout austin and kayla. He was just askin me questions about austin and i told him that i didnt know. Then we were talkin bout kayla and he was tellin me how much he really liked her and that he was tired of her dad not likin him cause her dad didnt even know him. so i dunno. Its just a big crazy mess. 
And the whole thing with kayla and josh is perfect betwen them. Its funny... how im so happy for kayla and josh and i have almost everything that i could want and im still not happy. I dont feel happy about anything, i mean sure im really glad for josh and kayla and how well they have gotten along and managed to stay together through everything...its great... but i think that im not happy because im missing too much. I need to just forget about everything amd move on. but its too hard."

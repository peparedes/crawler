school is a huge pain and work and tennis just make it worse. 
all this junk makes me just really stressed out and people are starting to really annoy me. 
yay for junior year?

thank god for livejournal so i can rant and no one cares.

"event","so the past few weeks have been kinda weirdly sucking and i don't know why. but this weekend was better

friday, me jen and pema made the best cupcakes like ever. they were the shit. literally. prettttty cool. and it snowed like a beast, not fun.

saturday, i shoveled with jamjam in the wee morning hours. and we made fiddy bucks. not too shabby. and thennn steph nitopi's sweet sixteen! shixa and jen came over and we took 70 bagillion hours to do our makeup. we partied it up with the gross dj. and jamjams guid moves, my moonwalk, and jen stepping on my feet kinda owned the dancefloor i must admit. it was totally like 8th grade all over again and it was pretty damn fun. 

today was jamjam's birthday. lodi buffet was yummy. i love being fat. &lt;3 i don't feel good though. my eyes really hurt and i don't know why. and it sucks. heres to another sucky week of school. gooodbye."

"event","so basically, this weekend was pretty alrighttttt. i had stomach virus friday so i missed school. that made me sad. that's kinda not sarcasm. throwing up is never fun. except josh brought me soup and chocolate and stuff and i was happy. and i saw snakes on a plane! goood movie. 

mallinggg on saturday with jen, pema, mirna and jamjam was fun. especially running throughout the whole mall to try and get to the right place at the right time. of course me jen and mirna are speds and run outside the mall and back inside to get to our destination. what coolkids we are.

cool and today was probably the good end to my weekend. i woke up early and went snowboarding with mirna and jen. and the plakalovic family, of course. first of all the name of my snowboard was wingnut. yes, wingnut. could it get any better. so wingnut, ponyboy, and hannah basically owned the slopes. we have some skills let me tell you. after two times down the bunny slope we were on the big hill, best believe. and me and mirna snuck onto the tubing line, while jen got left behind because she took too long to pick out a pretty colored tube. silly jen. so yeah, that was fun :]

and i just watched a really good movie. i almost shed a tear, srsly. 

my ass is sore, for show.

this week went uber slow but whatever. tomorrow's friday and saturday is pema's birthday. happy early birthday pema! :] 

i think mirna might come to florida wif me. so rob can't sleep in his undies. rofl. i can't wait to get a tan and look guid. even though i already look guid

"event","school kinda sucks right about now. shitloads of work is never fun. and our new history teacher is pretty much a big ol bitch. but at least she's gone for 4 days. and i passed my driver's test today. woooh
yesterday at bowling, me and pema almost mastered the curve. well not mastered, but we learned it. finallllly. today was really really fucking cold. well not that cold but colder than it's been lately.  it's sorta a good thing i guess; i don't wanna die of global warming.

i rode a ghetto ass bike to mirna's, that was embarrasing but fun at the same time. then we rode bikes some more to jen's wearing some hardcore bandanas and glasses. b1k3rz! 
meredith's party was the shit. all four of us basically owned and everyone thought we were drunk. i love not caring what people think. :]]]

so, friday and saturday were really really good days. probably some of the best.
christmas is kinda sucking so far. my brother woke me up at 7am to open stufff. everything my mom bought me doesn't fit. to top it off she just told me that she bought me a camera a lot nicer than the one my grandma bought me, but she returned it. i probably sound like a brat but come on? like way to make me feel bad. 

huge family thing in a few hours, and i really am not looking forward to it.

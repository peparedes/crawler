"event","Dawlish finishes giving his brief, and I look around at my colleagues.  We've just received word that a group of Death Eaters have amassed in Somerset.  I'm working with Henry McFarland on this case.  Others have moved off into smaller groups to discuss their assignments, and Henry turns to me.

""Ready to go, Longbottom?""

I nod, and together, we walk from the room.  We're to watch the safe house from a place next door.  After Apparating, Henry and I get settled in the watch house, taking over from Tavish and Lordes.  They've listed the names of those inside the house, but beyond that, we know little.  With the Death Eaters marks having disappeared, it is going to be harder to find evidence against them that is indisputable. It will be tedious work, but if we can gather enough evidence to bring formal charges against them, it will be a strike against them.  While the general public may believe that things will calm down now that my grandfather is gone, the Aurors know better.

Sighing, I sit down and wait for something to happen."

"event","As it has been since the attack, the Auror division is quite busy.  Owls come in daily with people reporting their neighbors for suspected Death Eater activities.  It seems now that the rumors of Voldemort's demise are spreading about, people aren't as scared to turn in their near and dear.  Of course, ninety nine percent of the 'Death Eaters' are nothing of the sort -- most have been caused by people who are irritated with their neighbors for one thing or the other.  The other one percent are really those we suspect anyhow, so we're learning little new information.

But we must look into each and every tip, even if we're being run ragged with false leads.  Part of me wonders if this is the product of whomever is trying to fill the vacuum left by my grandfather.  Perhaps it's part of some grand, evil scheme to keep us too tied up to do anything productive.

My mind goes to the portal and how it's changed.  After the attack, I worked with Dawlish on wards and setting them, and have started to check on the portal every few days.  Fleur is doing a superb job, but I don't trust my grandfather, even if it appears he's gone forever. It seems best to keep my ear to the ground on that score at least.

Which brings me to Tori.  Her revelation about the portal was startling, and it disturbs me that she knows something she shouldn't.  I need to speak with her, to find out what else she knows.  Of the six of us who were there, only Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer with us.  I saw their bodies with my own eyes, but I'll be the first to admit that sometimes what I see isn't the truth.  Of course, perhaps she's really a Death Eater in disguise - she has got that tattoo, but I find it difficult to believe that my grandfather would accept a Muggle.  But she did perform magic ... so perhaps it's all a ruse.  But the Death Eaters weren't with us when we saw the doors, so I don't see how she'd know that particular bit about what we saw.  Yes, she's quite the conundrum.  I make a mental note to owl her a bit later so we can get together.  I should look into it at the very least.

Rubbing my face, I turn to the Floo which has just lit up with the face of an elderly woman.  I nod and pick up my quill as she begins talking about how her third cousin once removed *must* be a Death Eater because he scowls far too often and seems to have a fondness for large black cloaks.  I dutifully take down the information, listening with only half an ear as I nod in the appropriate places."

I flip through the book that is now quite dog-eared.  Glancing at the calendar and counting the weeks, I turn to the appropriate chapter so I can be prepared for any eventuality.  

""Longbottom, what is it that you keep reading while on break?  I swear you've gone through that book ten times so far!""

I look up and blush a bit guiltily as I meet Jonathan Taylor's eyes.  My fellow recruit grins and reaches for the book, but I close it quickly.  

""None of your business, Taylor.  And I've only read it entirely three times.""  I shove the book back in my bag and stand up.  ""Come on, we've got the meeting in ten minutes.""

Together, we head down to the conference room and sit down, exchanging grins as Moody's voice booms over everyone else.

""It's too quiet.  I'm worried.  We must have constant vigilance!  Riddle won't keep quiet for long, mark my words and we must be prepared for any eventuality!""

Sighing, I silently acknowledge the truth of his words.  It's a waiting game now to see what he'll do.  Moody is right, he has been too quiet.  There were no reprecussions from the raid, and that isn't logical at all.  Perhaps I'll speak to Remus when I get home and see if the Order has heard anything."

Of course, I do a bit of shopping while I'm there.  The display in one window caught my eye, and I stare at it for several minutes until I get up the nerve to go inside.

The tinkling of the bell makes me jump, and I feel a flush come to my cheeks as the saleswoman looks at me in amusement.

""I ... uh ... just looking.""

She nods. ""Let me know if I can get anything for you.""

I nod, blushing again as I go to the front of the store, staring at the item.  In a snap decision, I turn to the woman. ""I'd like that one, please.""

She looks at me with a smile.  ""Lovely choice, sir,"" she says as she retrieves it and brings it to the register to tally up.  While there, I spot a book on the counter.  I pick it up and leaf through it quickly before adding it to the purchases.  

Taking the bag with me back to work, I charm it so it looks like something innocuous.  Wouldn't want to start any rumors, after all."

After waking me in the most delightful of manners, we went for a walk around the grounds, enjoying being with each other.  I haven't had a lot of time at home since training began, and it was very nice to be with her.

We shagged behind the castle in the hedge maze, then picnicked by the lake at lunch, shagged in a secluded inlet (I swear the Squid was watching - pervy beast), had a lovely dinner on the balcony of the Astronomy Tower, and shagged under the stars.

I turn over to her and see her blinking tiredly at me.  ""This is the best birthday I've ever had, love.  Thank you,"" I say leaning over to kiss her. ""I love you.""

""Love you too,"" she says, snuggling into me.

I shower and dress quickly and make my way to the small garden that is on the terrace.  After choosing three brilliantly colored blooms, I return to the bedroom and place one on my pillow.  The second I place in the bathroom, for that's her first stop when she awakens.  Finding a piece of parchment, I rip it into third.

On the first, I write <i>I love you.</i> and lay it on my pillow.  On the second, I write <i>I love you.  Now go back to bed.  I've a surprise.</i>  I lay that next to the flower on the sink and retreat to the kitchens.

If all goes well, she'll just be getting back into bed when I bring her the third - with breakfast.  

I retreat to the kitchens, smiling when I find a 'Kiss the Cook' apron.  Soon, I've managed to scramble up some eggs, make some toast and find a jar of strawberry preserves.  Smirking, I leave my clothes on the floor of the kitchen, wrap the apron around myself and, carrying the tray, return to our bedroom.

She laughs in delight when I enter, and reaches for her wand, casting a warming charm on the food.  As she pulls me to the bed, I grin.

I walk into our rooms and give Pansy a grin.  ""Hello, baby.  Kingsley's given me official permission to go to Italy - I had to tell him otherwise he would have had a fit - and wishes us well.  He's also promised not to breathe a word of it to anyone, though I don't know if that includes Tonks,"" I tell her.

I'm so exhausted.  But more importantly, I'm tired.  I'm tired of the charred remains of buildings I've seen for years, I'm tired of the lifeless bodies we keep finding, I'm tired of the broken dreams of the townspeople spilled out for all to see.  I'm tired of death and destruction and the pain they bring.  

Today, I was assigned to helping remove some of the buildings that are too far gone to save.  Pieces of people's lives were banished with my wand as I sent the remains to a field outside of town for investigation.  <i>""We need to look at things away from the gawkers.""</i>  

But they gawked anyway as their homes, their livelihoods disappeared.  Of course, they were only the remnants, the shells of those things, but they were also all they had left.  I ended up sending several families up to the castle for hot meals and baths.  We've plenty of room, after all.  I hope the kitchen staff wasn't overwhelmed, but it seemed best.  They trudged along, quite willing to do as they were told.  They'll return to their borrowed rooms, their borrowed clothing soon enough.  

As I walk back to the castle, I feel the need to *do* something for them.  Oh yes, they'll rebuild, but who will help them?  Who will loan them the money to do all this now that Gringott's is in Voldemort's hands?

I walk wearily into my room, shrugging off my soot-stained clothing and dropping it in the hamper.  I notice that the pile of clothes is becoming larger than normal.  I've got to do some Cleansing charms, and perhaps get out the washtub this weekend, but I'm too tired to think of it now.

I take a quick shower, thankful to wash off the soot and grime.  Although it's quite early, I need sleep, so I crawl into bed, sending a thought out to Pansy as my head hits the pillow.

<i>I'm home, baby.  I'm going to take a nap - I'm wiped.  Love you.</i>

I have refused to leave her side - going so far as to even move the cot I awoke on until it was right next to her.  Lavender can't truly complain since I'm technically still in bed.  

I reach out a hand and smooth back her hair.  <i>I won't let you go, Pansy. I won't. I know that you do love me. You're mine.</i>

The look Kingsley sent me last night boded no good, but right now I don't care.  Between using the Unforgivables during Pansy's rescue and the fiasco of last night, I'm beginning to think that I am not cut out to be an Auror. Though, if they want blind obedience, Harry wouldn't have been one either.  He broke more rules than any other person I know.  He would have done just as I did.  

Odd, how Harry's become somewhat of my role model, even though I chafed at the thought I was taking over his life.  I haven't, I've made my own, but he was right about so many things.  I recall his letter, the one my grandmother gave me, and I sigh. I wish we could go back to being kids too.  It would be so much easier.

I don't know what to believe and the one I would ask, Pansy, is too caught up in her own pain for me to question.  I wouldn't want to burden her with this anyhow.  This is my problem and she's got too much to deal with already.

I should probably go to Tonks, but he said he'd kill her if he saw anyone else.  I should go to the Aurors, but I find that I want to see her myself first.  I want to be able to wreak pain on her flesh, like she did on Pansy, like she did on my heart.

I open my eyes and from the faint light given off by the lone candle, I see Pansy sleeping, one arm thrown over her head with a smile on her face.

I smile and gently trace her lips with my finger.  <i>She's mine, all mine.</i> I think in satisfaction. <i>Well, if I can protect her from Voldemort.</I>

I slip from the bed, keeping an eye on Pansy to make sure I don't wake her.  It's late enough that if she saw me getting up, she probably wouldn't think twice, but it's still very early for me.  I write her a quick note.

You're absolutely breathtakingly beautiful when you're asleep - did you know that?  (And you're even more stunning when you're awake, but I expect you know that.) It's hard to believe that you're going to be my wife.  Speaking of that, we do need to McGonagall sometime.  I'll owl her and tell her we'll see her soon.  She's probably got her knickers in a twist about not hearing from us (and ugh, what a mental image- sorry!)

Whistling, I decide that now is as good a time as any to do those pesky charms that allow us all to bathe in hot water and not be swamped by the lake in the Slytherin Common Room.  Whoever thought of putting it under the lake anyhow?"

She's my everything and there isn't anything I wouldn't do to protect her.  I can't lose someone else I love.  I can't.  I don't know if I'll be able to survive it.  I won't let that happen.  I'll use the Unforgivables before I let anything hurt Pansy or the baby.

The thought stops me cold. I mean it. I never thought I'd be willing to use them, but for Pansy, for the baby, there's no doubt in my mind that I'd kill to protect them.  I think to Tonks' practice later and know that while the lessons are useful, they aren't what I'll need to really protect Pansy.  Kingsley said something about teaching the Unforgiveables, I'll have to talk to him.  I won't let anything happen to Pansy.

I look up as she comes out and we walk hand and hand to the Great Hall.  It's fairly deserted and we eat quickly, chatting about unconsequential things.  I give her a kiss before she goes to the greenhouse and I go to Tonks' lessons.  I'm slightly out of breath when I reach the workout area and I sigh.  Tonks is right, I do need to get in better shape if I want to survive this war."

But it was nice, relaxing and almost ... homey.  I haven't felt that way in years, since before I came to Hogwarts as a First Year.  It worries me.  I'm afraid I'm getting too far into this ... whatever it is with Pansy.  I don't want to get in over my head, but it just feels so right.  It's all happened so quickly that I feel as if my world is spinning out of control, except that she's the one constant thing.  The way she looked after me this past weekend was ... it made me feel so cared for.  I smile, thinking of the other ways in which she proved she cares for me.  Yes, it was a very rejuvenating weekend.

Her house was about what I had expected, though truthfully until we arrived.  It was a rich man's palace, with numerous dark objects around.  She could tell I disapproved and so didn't mention them.  I do hope she disposes of them presently.  They certainly can't be any good to us.  It would make us no better than them to use that type of magic.

I look around my room and see Dean's bed has been slept in.  At least I know he's still alive, for all that I see him.  I really should go down to the greenhouse to look over the plants.  With both Pansy and myself having been gone, Merlin only knows what state they're in now.

Before I go, I see the prophet on my bed and flip it open.  I gasp as I see the front page.  Padma and Justin!  I rush as fast as I can to my desk and write a quick letter to Justin.  He is the only one who'll be able to receive it, according the article.

The Hufflepuffs will do better in the kitchen anyhow.

I retrieve my clothes and use Pansy's shower quickly.  All that she has are somewhat girlish shampoos and soap.  I wrinkle my nose, but not wanting to smell horribly, I use the florally scented stuff.

"event","I indeed made it back to my room last night without seeing anyone else who disliked me, much to my relief.  But the morning light shines into the room on Harry's empty bed and I stare at it, lost in the memories.

One month ago all was right in the world.  We were winning the war, had hopes for the future.  Harry and Ginny seemed like the perfect couple, and Ron had proposed to Hermione at Christmas.  They had been preparing for a June wedding.  She even had her dress picked out.  I remember when she and the other girls had poured over the catalogs in the common room around New Year's, oohing and ahhhing over different styles.  I had never seen Hermione act so girly.  We blokes had rolled our eyes and played Exploding Snap, making snarky comments when the squeals became particularly shrill.

I'd give anything to hear the shrill shrieks of girlish happiness again.  It's so quiet now.  There's little laughter, and I can't remember the last time we all hung around in the common room together.  It's like the ties that had once held us together are frayed and broken.  We seek each other out rarely.  The holes in our ranks are too noticeable when we're all together.

After the battle, someone had cleaned up their belongings.  I don't know who did Harry's, but Bill came for Ron's and Dean packed up Seamus' things.  And now their beds are empty.  A room that once held all the mischief, gaiety and richness of life that five growing boys could produce was now only an empty shell.  Three beds are empty, and Dean might as well have fallen off the face of the earth for all I see him.

I feel tears prick my eyes and I wipe them away quickly.  Not because I'm afraid anyone will see, who's around to after all?  But I'm afraid I won't be able to hold it all in if I let go.  

My eyes catch on the bedside table.  I reach over and open the drawer, extracting the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/neville_bldrmn/1760.html#cutid1"">letters</a> Dumbledore and Harry wrote me.  I carefully open them, re-reading them.  

They stir my anger again.  Anger that all this has been placed upon me when I didn't want it; that I'm now in a position of leadership, that I'm the one everyone goes to when there's a problem.  I don't want to be this person!  I want to go back to being plain old Neville Longbottom!

I stuff them quickly back in the drawer and stand up, my face fixed in a scowl.  I get dressed quickly and make my way to the Great Hall, grabbing a few slices of bread and jam for breakfast.  I don't much feel like talking to anyone at the moment.  My eyes flicker across the announcement hanging by the doors and I frown.  I've removed most of the Longbottom fortune weeks ago, on Gran's orders.  The key to the new vault in the dungeons below the lake is in my desk drawer.  At least that's something I don't have to worry about.

I head to the greenhouse to do the gardening I had planned to do yesterday before Parkinson ruined that for me."

I still didn't find anything, so I decided to go to the greenhouse.  I'm now up to my elbows in soil and am quite happy.  Parkinson did a nice job on expanding the beds.  I will owl her when I get back to my room.

One thing after another is going wrong, and just when I begin to have time to think on things, on all that's happened, something comes along and my thoughts are taken up once again.  I haven't had any time at all to really think about that blasted prophecy, or my new role in the castle.  

Up until now, I let my mind wander from topic to topic, but avoiding the ones I know will be painful.  But I can't help but think of things now, when the only sound is the falling dirt.

I poke through the lettuce, and coming upon an odd looking leaf, scowl.  ""Dennis!"" I yell, pulling the boy over by the sleeve of his robe.  I dangle the leaf between my fingers right in front of his nose.  ""Do you have any idea what this is?  Where did you get it?""

He looks at me blankly. ""I ... I picked it from outside.  Hagrid always had lettuce growing there,"" he says, his eyes wide and frightened.

I throw it down angrily, knowing I've got the attention of the kitchen but not really caring.  ""It's not lettuce, you bloody idiot!  It's scurvy grass and you nearly poisoned us all!"" I snap, grabbing my bowl and heading to the garbage pail.  I dump it out and turn to him, thrusting the bowl at him.  ""Here, wash this out.  You're on dish duty for the rest of the meal.""

There's silence in the makeshift kitchen and I raise an eyebrow. ""Dinner won't cook itself, people!"" I say, scowling.

Half an hour later, dinner is being floated to the Great Hall, and with a sigh of relief, I oversee the staff cleaning up.  It's a job soon completed, and they disperse quickly.  I make my way back to my room, vaguely aware of not having eaten too much, despite being in the kitchen.  Or perhaps that's 'because of'.  I rumamge around in my trunk and pull out my last Chocolate Frog.  This should hold me over until morning.

As I bit off its head, smiling to myself as it stops wriggling immediately, I let my mind wander.  I'm grateful to Pansy for pointing out Dennis' mistake but ... she didn't need to be such a ruddy bitch about it.  I grin and pull a parchment from my desk.  

With a flourish, I sign my name and hurry to the owlery.  I watch the owl fly off with a sense of satisfaction.  Walking back to Gryffindor Tower, I realize I should owl McGonagall about Charlie, but I'm too tired to make another trip.  I'll ask her tomorrow.  I hope we get the kitchens back tomorrow.  If Lavender wasn't so caught up with caring for Justin, I'd have to sanitize Hagrid's entire hut.  Merlin only knows what people will catch if too many more meals are cooked out there.

Where in the name of Merlin will I be able to cook breakfast for fifty people?  I frown, realizing that Hagrid's old hut is the only place with a cook fire, if one discounts the potions classroom, which I do.

Once we get there, I put Susan to scrubbing the table and removing the old jugs of Firewhiskey to the back.  

The group quickly begins preparing the meal.  It's different cooking over one fire than the four in the main kitchens, and I'm afraid it shows in our food.  The eggs are either too runny or too firm and the toast is a bit charred too, but they shouldn't complain - at least they're getting fed.  In fact, if I send along some jam, they'll be able to cover it up.  No one will notice if it's covered up, right?  I wince.  Yes, they will, but I don't pay any mind to it.  I've enough to deal with.

I'm relieved that I'm all alone in the greenhouse.  My gaze is caught by the cabinet that had been Professor Sprout's private stores.  I hadn't dared to do that while Dumbledore and Harry were alive, afraid I'd be overstepping my bounds, but now I have as much right to as Sprout herself, if she were here.

I'm pleased to find that there are dozens of packets of seeds waiting to be sown, and most of them are foodstuffs.  Carrots, broccoli, beans, a few varieties of lettuce.

I'll have to research it a bit later, but first, I'll plant them.  After all, it can't hurt.

I put down my quill and tie up the letters, and hurry off to the owlery.  I'm vaguely surprised not to see anyone on my trip, but am actually glad for it.  I really don't want to hear any more expressions of sympathy, even if they're well-meant."

"event","It's still hard to believe they're gone.  I watched their bodies be lowered into the ground, McGonagall at my side, and I didn't quite believe it.  I made all the arrangements, notified the proper authorities and family members, did everything I was supposed to, except grieve.  I had thought before I left Hogwarts that I'd grieve at the funeral, but I still haven't been able to have a moment's peace to think about what really happened.  Before leaving I was busy through my own doing, and while at the manor, I had a list as long as my arm of tasks to accomplish.  I wasn't able to sleep much either.  It was too eerie being in the house without them, with the freshly painted walls and the new front door.  

It seems like I've just pushed all my feelings down and locked them away.  I feel them, but I'm distanced.  If I could bottle this, I'm sure it would fly off the shelves, especially now.  Though I know it isn't healthy, I can't make myself care -- there's too much to do before I can rest.

McGonagall and I Apparate to the gates of Hogwarts and walk up to the doors together.  We go our separate ways at the door, and she nods a goodbye at me, bidding me good night.

""Good night, professor,"" I say to her retreating back.  ""Thank you.""  I make my way to Gryffindor Tower, noting that somebody had scrubbed the floors.  I nod my head.  Padma was a good choice after all.

I walk through the portrait and sigh in relief to see no one there.  I just want to sleep.  I hurry up the stairs and put my bag down.  I lay down on my bed, ignoring Gran's voice in my head telling me to get my shoes off my bed spread.  I'm too tired to care right now.

The last thought that goes through my head before I fall asleep is that I really must talk to Ginny tomorrow to thank her for her kind owl."

"event","One thought reverberates through my head as I hurry back to Gryffindor Tower.  <i>This isn't fair!</i>  It doesn't change anything, but it makes me feel a bit better.  I fortunately see no one, I couldn't handle an actual conversation right now I don't think, and by the time I reach my room, I am feeling a bit more collected, though that is probably because it hasn't really sunk in yet.  

My mind ticks over the things I have to do.

One, owl Justin and inform him that Ginny and whomever McGonagall was referring to will be our main chefs until further notice

Two, owl Ginny and tell her that.  

Three, owl Padma and Oliver and let them know I'll be gone for a few days. 

With those tasks in mind, I sit calmly at my desk and begin to write.  Dean doesn't even notice anything's amiss when he stumbles to the bathroom.  I scribble the notes hastily and then I'm off to the owlery.  <i>Keeping busy is good,</i> I decide. <i>It doesn't allow as much time to think.</i>"

The stone is familiarly cool on my feet as I go to the window, wondering why an owl would come to me now rather than at breakfast.  My eyes widen upon seeing McGonagall's familiar handwriting on the parchment I take from the owl.  I unroll it, and upon reading it, a nervousness begins in my stomach.

I dress quickly, noting that for once, Dean is asleep in bed.  Or at least I assume so since his bed curtains are drawn.

"event","I lay back in my bed and close my eyes, trying to forget the day.  Even spending the rest of the afternoon and evening in the Greenhouse didn't help too much.  I just kept replaying the past few days over in my head and been overwhelmed. I even had to re-plant a few seeds because I overwatered them.  I haven't done that since my first year!

Too much has happened for me to really comprehend it at the moment and right now, sleep sounds very very nice.  A crinkle from my pocket makes my eyes fly open as I remember the envelope McGonagall gave me earlier.  <i>How on earth did I forget about it?</i>

I pull it out eagerly and break the seal.  Two letters fall out and I swallow as I recognize Harry's handwriting on the front of one.  I unroll the other first, saving Harry's for last for some reason I can't name.

<lj-cut text=""Read the letters"">
<i>Dear Neville,

You don't mind that I call you Neville, do you?  I don't know if I ever did so in your presence before, but alas, an old man's mind can wander from time to time.  As it is now, apparently.  

If you're reading this, it means that both Harry and myself are no more.  I wish I could foresee the circumstances, but alas, I failed Divination when I attended Hogwarts.  But back to the matter at hand.  You have been inducted in the Inner Council of the Order of the Phoenix by this point, I assume, and so know a little about your duties as the leader of the younger members.  

Your first and foremost (and most obvious) task is ensuring that the daily routine of Hogwarts continues.  Regardless of who is lost, those who fight still need to eat, sleep in clean beds and have a place to call home.  If there is one lesson I have learned in my many years of fighting, it's that one will fight harder than anything to make sure they still have a home to go to.  I have often wondered if, had Tom Riddle had a caring home, if he would have turned out as he did.  But that is in the past, and we mustn't dwell on it overly much.  I know you will do an admirable job as you were always a very conscientious young man.

Your second task is less pleasant, I'm afraid.  It is up to you to find witches and wizards who can go out and fight for our cause.  It is your duty to select the ones that best fit the mission, and you must do so knowing that they might not return.  It is not an easy task, and I regret that it must be asked of you, but it is necessary for what we fight for.  

By this point, I imagine you are wondering why you accepted the position when it was offered to you -- and perhaps wondering why it was offered in the first place.  That is a long tale and it involves Harry as much as it does you.  

As I'm sure you recollect from the battle at the Department of Mysteries at the end of your fifth year, Tom Riddle was clearly after something.  Only a select few know what it was, however.  He wished to hear of a prophecy - a prophecy that concerned himself and a young child - a baby even.  If you're curious about the exact wording of the prophecy, I suggest you speak with Professor McGonagall, as I hesitate to even put the words down here.  To sum it up, it was foretold that a boy with the power to vanquish him would be born at the end of July.  Clearly, he believed this to be Harry, for he marked him on his forehead, albeit unintentionally.  However, it is entirely possible that, with Harry gone, the prophecy is still in effect through you.  You too have been marked by Tom's actions - although your scars are internal, rather than external.  

Forgive me if I bring up painful memories of your parents for you, but it is necessary for you to understand what Tom is after.  The prophecy stated that both Tom and the boy could not live at the same time.  If Harry is no longer, then the task falls to you.  Prophecies are unclear things, and while Harry was the obvious target, it might be that Tom will believe that you are also part of it.  Whether that is true, I do not know, but do not forget this to your peril.

I shall end here.  I wish I could answer the hundreds of questions I'm sure you have.  Professor McGonagall should be able to answer them, as I cannot.

Be well, Neville and never forget that the Sorting Hat put you in Gryffindor for a reason.  You're a bright lad and I have the utmost confidence in you.  Best of luck!

~Albus Dumbledore
</i>

I reread the letter.  This ... this is insane!  He can't be serious!   With shaking hands, I open Harry's letter.

<i>
Neville,

Well, looks like the worst has happened and I'm dead.  I hoped it wouldn't turn out this way, but what can a bloke do?  If you haven't read Dumbledore's letter, go read it now.  He can explain things better than I can.

I guess you've read it then.  For what it's worth, I'm sorry.  I never wanted to have a 'destiny' and I don't think you wanted one either, but it doesn't seem like anyone asked us.  Of course, it could be that both Dumbledore and I are wrong and the prophecy ends with me.  It wouldn't be the worst thing, I suppose.  After all, I guess I'm dead, so it could be over.  Then again, Voldemort's absolutely barmy so I don't think he'd let a little detail like that matter to him.  

Be careful, okay?

As for the rest of this leader thing, try not to let it get you down.  Find someone reliable (maybe a Hufflepuff?) to help you with the castle.  Justin Finch-Fletchley is a good bloke and should be able to lend you a hand.  The other half of the responsibility is the part that is the hardest.  But know that I, at least, understand what you're going to have to do.  It's bloody difficult to decide who should go and who shouldn't on missions, but it needs to be done.  Get to know a little bit about everyone.  It doesn't help when they don't come back, but it will make it a little easier in figuring out who can handle a particular mission or not.

If you can, find a couple people to help you.  Learn to delegate.  That's been a lifesaver for me.  (Yes, I see the irony of writing that in a letter that will only be delivered if I die.)  Ron and Hermione have kept me together and on track for years now and I don't know what I'd do without them.  

Fuck, I wish I didn't have to write this.  Can't we go back to being kids again?  I'd give anything to be eleven on the Express again.  We were so bloody innocent.  Can I tell you something?  I'm so scared sometimes I just want to run away.  I haven't told anyone that, except you just now.  I don't know why I did, except as a last will and testament kind of thing.  I guess I had hoped it'd make me feel better, admitting it, but it hasn't.  

Anyway, apart from the official duties, I have one more for you. Take care of everyone for me, especially Ginny.  She looks so lost sometimes, I just don't know what to do.  I can't imagine life without her and I like to think she'd be just as lost with me, except I hope she isn't.  Make sure she knows it's okay to live and be happy again, all right?  

Anyway, I hear Ron and Hermione calling so I should go.  Take care, Neville, and good luck.

Kick his arse for me!

~Harry

I think I'm going to be sick.  I bolt for the bathroom and vomit up my dinner.  I lean against the toilet and try to catch my breath. 

""This is fucking insane.""  My voice reverberates off the tile and I shake my head.  This can't be happening.  I never asked for this, I don't want this!

I ignore the little part of me that whispers that Harry didn't either.  After all, I'm not Harry Potter.  I haven't defeated He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named every year since I was eleven and once when I was a baby just for kicks!  I'm just plain, clumsy, stupid Neville Longbottom.  I don't have a chance in hell of succeeding.  They're mad.  They must be, to think I can do this.  And this is all because of a *prophecy*?  This only reaffirms that nothing good has ever come from Divination.  

I stand up and rinse my mouth out, trying to push back the panic that threatens to overwhelm me.  I'll worry about this in the morning.  It's too much to deal with right now.

I walk unsteadily back to my bed and see the letters, lying innocently on the coverlet. I resist the urge to tear them to pieces and simply shut them in my trunk.  I lay on the bed and try not to think about it too much."

"event","I walk quickly from the Great Hall and soon find myself back in the Gryffindor common room.  In relief, I see Oliver on the couch, flipping through a battered copy of <i>Quidditch Through the Ages</i>.  I plop in the seat next to him and clear my throat awkward.

""Something you need, Neville?"" he asks, not taking his eyes from the book.

""I'd like your help,"" I blurt out.  At least I've got his full attention.  ""I figured that ... Harry had Ron and Hermione and I need help too if I'm to do this properly.  So I've asked Padma and she said yes, and now I'm asking you.""

He blinks and his lips turn upward in a small smile. ""I'd be happy to, Neville,"" he says.  ""I'm flattered that you asked.""

I sigh in relief.  ""Thanks loads, Oliver,"" I say.  ""There's a meeting today after lunch that I'm supposed to go to, if you don't have anything else to do?""

He quickly agrees and I leave him to his reading, though I can feel his thoughtful gaze on me as I run to my room. 

I take out my quill and begin writing a note of apology to Ginny.  It takes several tries before I have a version I'm happy with.  I only hope that she's not going to be too upset with me.

Now I just have to go post it."

The past twenty-four hours have turned my life upside down and I don't know if I could deal with his sly, knowing glance when I hurried in at a quarter past seven in the morning.  Though maybe he wouldn't say a word.  He hasn't spoken much since Seamus died.

I shake myself and peel the clothes from my body, heading to the shower.  As the warm water begins to fall I close my eyes.  It all seems unreal.  First, McGonagall with her announcement, and did I really accept?  Then I take advantage of Padma's grief, and leave without saying a word.  But what makes it even worse is the fact that I can't get the image of Ginny's pale, slight body, flushed with passion from my mind.  I'm a right prat.  

As my hand slips down and begins to touch my erection, I change my mind.  I'm not a prat - I'm a complete and utter wanker."

I gently disentangle myself and reach for my clothes.  I get dressed quickly, keeping one eye on Padma to see if she wakes up.  When she doesn't, I smile softly at her and quietly leave the room.  

No one's in the Ravenclaw common room to see me leave, which I'm grateful for.  I hadn't intended that to happen, not at all.  I'll apologize to her later.  It's the right thing to do.

On my way back to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Lupin asks me to look in on Ginny to make sure she's awake for her shift in the kitchens.  He gives me an odd grin as he takes his leave, and I know he knows where I was.  Or has suspicions.  So now I've ruined Padma's reputation.

I hang my head in guilt as I make my way up the stairs to Ginny's room.  The only good thing about this morning so far is the fact that it's Ginny's turn to cook. She's a better cook than Charlie is."

"event","I blindly make my way to the headmistress' office, still dazed from what had just happened with Padma.  Did I just agree to meet her in her room?  

The thought is pushed from me as I stop by the gargoyle, which promptly opens the door for me. Things have changed a bit since our days in school -- the ability to find and get to the Headmaster, and now the Headmistress, was too important to have to know a password.  The gargoyle now allows anyone to go up, provided the Headmistress is in her office. 

As I walk up the stairs, I contemplate another change since school-- the removal of the wards on the girls' dormitories.  At least that will make getting to Padma's room easier.  

I clear my throat when I reach the top of the stairs and Professor McGonagall looks up with a sad smile. ""Hello, Mr. Longbottom,"" she greets me.

""Hello, Professor,"" I reply a bit nervously, taking the seat in front of her desk.

""There's no need to look as if I'm about to eat you.  I just wanted to discuss a few things before the meeting tomorrow,"" she informs me.  Meeting?  There's a meeting?  I say as much and she nods.  ""Yes, between the de facto leaders of the Order, as well as several Aurors.  It's when we decide our plans and movements for the next few weeks.""

I nod, unsure of what else to say.  I don't see how I'll be able to give any useful input, but I wisely keep my mouth shut.  Who am I to tell her that Professor Dumbledore and Harry were wrong?  

""Who else will be here?"" I ask, finally finding my voice.

She nods in approval.  Or at least I think it's approval.  ""Other than the two of us, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Nymphadora Tonks, Arthur Weasley, Bill, Charlie and George Weasley, Severus Snape and Remus Lupin.  Of course, if there's anyone else you feel you'd like to have attend, please just let me know.""

I nod.  Me, with all of them?  Are they mad?  What can I do that they couldn't?  Realizing that she's waiting for an answer, I clear my throat. ""Um ... Oliver Wood, if you think he'd agree?  And perhaps Padma Patil?""

She looks at me in surprise for a moment before nodding.  ""I shall speak to Wood, if you'll talk with Miss Patil.  And for what it's worth, I do think your choices are smart ones,"" she says.

I smile, relaxing minutely.  There, my first major decision is made and McGonagall thinks it's a good one.  I only wish the rest of them would be this simple.  

""I will see you directly after lunch, Mr. Longbottom,"" she says.

Knowing a dismissal when I hear one, I nod and quickly retreat down the steps.  That didn't take nearly as long as I had thought it would.  My stomach drops as I realize that now I have to decide whether to go to Padma or not."

As I watch Padma walk away, immersed in her grief, I suddenly can't bear it any more either.  I need to be away, someplace safe, someplace where death and destruction isn't pressing down on me like the earth is on my friends.  I Apparate back to the gates of Hogwarts and step through.  

A sense of relief overwhelms me and I fight the urge to collapse right where I am and cry.  I do close my eyes though, and I can almost imagine that it's last year and everything's all right again.  That I'll open my eyes and see Harry and Ron and Hermione waving to me from the front steps.  But the silence that assaults my ears tears that fleeting hope away.  

Hogwarts has been closed all year.  It is no longer the school I remember.  It's our lone fort.  #12 Grimmauld Place is where the Order meets but we don't all fit there any more.  Hogwarts is were we plan, fight and live.  

I walk up to the doors and slip inside.  I'm soon sitting in front of the Gryffindor fire, where it burns away merrily, as if all is right in the world.  But it isn't, and even now the common room seems different.  It's empty, as if the heart and soul of Gryffindor has died along with my friends.  Maybe it has."

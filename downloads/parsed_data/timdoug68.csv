"event","So anyway, besides the day went like super slow for me, it was not bad I guess, after work I ran to my pub to get some lunch/dinner and hang out and relax for a while.  The place is not what it used to be for me though.  I mean the food is great and such, but most of the regular people that used to work that have moved on so there are all these new people, and they do not talk to me the way that Lindsey did or anything, she always gave the impression she cared about what I had to say, and would come sit down with me and talk.. 

I am still considered a regular there, they know what I drink and bring it right over without me having to ask or anything, they always know I like the soups and let me know what the special soup of the day, but there is not that old feeling there anymore.  I kinda miss it.  I guess for me it kinda replaced the going home and getting asked how my day was and talking to me in general...

So anyway after the pub I went home on a mission, to watch all the damn dvd's I have laying around and try to get though my netflix so i can return those this week and get a new load.  Well mission failed big time.  I started watching Serenity, a moive I bought and about half way through it probably around 5:45/6pm, I was out cold... lol  Did not wake up till around 2am and then went to bed cause that couch is not all that comfortable, and got up around 5:30am

Lets see if I can get through the rest of the movie today... lol"

"event","I think they should make the holiday weekend about 12 days long... Fully paid of course it was too short.... lol

Anyway, not much going on here, at work right now, kinda wait for a chance to get home, but got in kinda late and will have to be here till about 5:30pm.

Wed - Fri, I will be at training in bellevue all day, so will not be in seattle, not sure if I am going to have network connections so might not be able to chat or email, which kinda sucks, helps pass the day and all..  So we will see..

Hmmm, what else is going on....  Well heard from someone I was dating way way back in the begining, and have been talking to them off and on, got back in to playing my space game and talking to friends on there..

Monday, I went for a ride on my motorcycle after going out to dinner cause i did not want to cook at all, it was nice, kinda boring eating alone but it was ok.  

After dinner, I went for a ride around northeast lake washington area checking out all the houses on the water and the ones with views looking at the ones that are for sale...  Dreaming of the day when I win the lottery and will move in to one of those places.  If I did win the lottery I probably would stay in the bothell area somewhat....  Get a vacation house somewhere else....  as for the house i am in now not sure what i would do with that....  pay it off, probably demolish it and build something better...  Total investment, weather I keep or sell it who knows.

Anyway dreams right.....   But who knows, maybe luck will catch me and I can start making some dreams come true."

"event","Well it has been a fun Monday that is for sure got handed about 3 new projects so work is piling up like normal, and can not get most of them done...  All require tons of research and what not...  Feel like it was a mistake to get out of bed... lol

Got up late this morning cause I needed to go down to the city to pay my water bill and such...  Have to get my bills in order and on my board again so I know aht is coming up and such..

Last night, had the blues.....  Bunch of remembering going on and such, of what I was missing, what I have lost and then proceded to watch movies that I shouldn't have.  Seems when I start going down, that for some damn reason, I try to fuel it by watching movies, or listening to music that only drives it down further..

Friday went to a baseball game with Amanda, first time I have done that in a long time, did not go to a game all last year....  So this was my first ball game with out the other, it was a good game, could have used some heat though, froze my ears off... lol  we left early cause it was getting way to cold, came home and finished watching the game..

Amanda is great, I really like her, and am wondering where this is going, but at the same time my brain is sitting here yelling DUCK and COVER at me, trying to protect myself, to not get hurt by another loss in my life...  I have found myself building walls again, and quieting up some, kinda hard to break that habbit cause it is me trying to protect myself.  Then it makes me question myself asking wether this is going to far or something...  But I know one thing I do not want to be alone in my life that is for sure...  kinda like the old adtige, if you fall off the horse get right back on....

I have suffered so many loss's in my life, my therapist said it is going to take time to allow someone in and close to me, that my mind has a need to protect itself, and rightfully so....  But at the same time it is not fair to her either....  That here I am protecting myself, by putting a shield up to guard my inner feelings and not have to have more pain in mylife.

I do not miss Tess, I miss what we had, I miss my best friend, I miss that connection where you could complete each others sentenances, where looking at someone and know exactly what they are thinking...  I miss the feeling of family, I miss not being alone...

It is just me in the dog, and for some reason the dog will not talk back to me...  lol

Who knows.....  There used to be that 1 thing in life that i would give everything up for, and there still kinda is my sons... I would sacrafice everything for them, but there has to be more in life then your legacy or your children... there has to be something important to you that you would sacrafice everything for....  ""The juice has to be worth the squeeze"" a line for a movie I watched last night....

If i had some vacation time, I might jump on my bike sometime and go in search of life....  Cuase somewhere over the last few months, I have lost it...  Nothing seems to bring me pleasure latly, it all seems kinda like a job...  something that is just there...  I used to have a smile, where that went I have no idea..  I think about my mom sometimes....  miss her...  She left to early in my life...

Enough for now....  do not want to drain my day from me..."

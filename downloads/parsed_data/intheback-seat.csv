-Sylvia Plath

I agree.
For me, feer and humiliation feel honest.
They ensure devotion more than reverence, more than love. 
The damned loves the hand of the executioner. 
And compassion holds more weight when it follows ruthlessness.
Frankly speaking,
you've got to be cruel to be kind.
I've been thinking so much clearer lately.
And I've been being used so much more.
It's a thousand wonders my cousin and I aren't dead.
I've been ruthless.
And people have done bad things to us.
But we love it.
I need to stop getting drunk.
But I feel more comfortable when I'm drinking.
It feels nice to know the anonymity.
A boy is not kissing me; he is kissing my shit-face.
I've always wanted to hide.
I've wanted a mask like Dylan Thomas described:
""to shield the glistening brain and the blunt examiners""
I want to get shit-faced.
A term which itself connotes camoflauge.
I imagine that without it,
I would feel more vulnerable.
More afraid.
And I can never go back to that."

"event","I don't want to make friends with people that attempt to catch my attention by staring or glancing. I don't want to make friends with people that follow me for a few minutes and walk away. I don't want to make friends with people that sit next to me or near me and wait for me to say something. I don't want to make friends with people that keep showing up at my job in hopes some connecting moment with make miracle of itself. I don't want to make friends with people that say ""I like your style/hair/makeup/jacket/eyebrows"" and then don't have anything else lined up. I don't want to make friends with people that talk to me out of the blue. 

I want someone to walk up next to me and keep walking as if we know one another and we started together from point [a] and plan to continue to point [b]. I want someone who keeps going no matter how far I go, keeping up and not questioning or asking ""where"". I want someone who just says ""hey"" and that ends it. I want someone who understands that silence in verbality can be golden because smalltalk is filler and shit and neither of us cared anyway. 

because I don't care about the abbreviations or crushedtotwowords sentences, like your GED or your STD or your job as a prostitute. That you live near a celebrity or me. That you did or didn't make mommy and daddy proud. That you're a rebel that you conform that you're a dem or a rep or an indy or who you voted for and your OH AND FUCK BUSH 5secondsoundbyte statement. Your political views and your social economical middleclassvsupperclass bullshit. Your five thousand patches of bands names too fucking obscure or too easy to come up with like ""Global Threat"" and ""Indy 5"" and ""No Kid's Underground"" and ""Antiamerican Presidancy"" and blahblahblahblah. The words here are never and ever. Not yet. 

I want someone who can just walk. Because before you speak you know nothing of a person more than their physicalities. How they carry themself, the look on their face, the way they stepskipstumbleand [stop]. How they cross a street with traffic near and how they get through a crowd. If they look both ways. If they breathe through their mouth or their nose. The things you always learn later when the friend or person mattered, because by then we were past all your mememe I'll listen just so I can talk. Because by then you cared. Because you were comfortable without talking. 

I want that first and all the rest after. Because I don't want to know your life and it's little details until I am comfortable, not the other way around. It should always be that way. 

Too bad no one does that."

Using and abusing.

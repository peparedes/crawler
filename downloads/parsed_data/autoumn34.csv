I just want to finish school and be out of florida... they are calling it 102 degrees today...uhm, its october.. no one should be sweating on halloween! On another note, apparently I have a bunch of cists (I cant figure out the correct spelling... yea... still suck) on the right and left lobe of my thyroid... the doc told me to get an ultra sound again in 6 months and just hope they dont turn cancerous.. yea, thanks for the vode of confidence lol. eh, we shall see what happens. She also put me on sleeping pills and wants to put me on prosac... I am not sure how I feel about that... I'll see what I think in a couple of weeks."

"event","<p>So every hundred years or so I make a post on this thing.... again never knowing who even still reads it. I am kinda bored... Eating linner I suppose you can say (lunch and dinner for those of you that should be wearing a helmet ;) ) I am so stressed.. Working 2 jobs and taking 2 summer classes... I mean they arent hard classes, just time consuming... I have had my first exam already in death and dying and didnt even get the chance to open the book... and as for the online class... well, I have been even more pathetic with that. But wokring at the lab is going pretty well... I am now entering data and auditing it for the Phds to create the statistics and what not... I dont know when it will all be published but hopefully within the next 5 years. Ford amp is going shitty socially but good for money... it sucks to work with your friends... Not becauseI dont like being around them, I do. But most people dont know how to seperate work from friends... and I am ready to explode and kill most of them.... so it goes right? But yea... other then that I am suppose to go and see 28 weeks later today... heard mixed reviews... wonder how it will go... </p>"

"event","yea.. been forever since I have last updated. Does anyone even read this shit anymore> I dont really think so... possibly? school has been insane, so many new people and places and work that has to be done. It has been said that classes get in the way of college... it is all so too true. I would write a 1000 page entry and it couldnt even describe every event and thought that one week creates, or even one weekend if it is one of the more busy ones. even if i could, it wouldnt matter, this is all just a means to an end anyhow."

Smeared black ink... your palms are sweaty 
And I'm barely listening to last demands 
I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath 
Where I am 

I'll wear my badge... a vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest 
That tells your new friends I am a visitor here... 
I am not permanent 
And the only thing keeping me dry is 
Where I am 

You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex 
A stranger with your door key explaining that I am just visiting 
And I am finally seeing

"event","wow...
ok, so thur night, we didnt leave for orlando as planned, cos me and Kara had other things to do, so Jordan had her mom come and pick her up that afternoon? I just dont even know. Friday morning, which turned into friday afternoon Kara and I drove to orlando and met up with jordan at her house. He hung out for a bit, and then went to see Our Lady Peace. It was a good show, however the crowd sucked so bad, i felt like I was at an uneventful christia concert filled with 50 yr olds... but thats ok, it wasnt hard to just get to the front <3
Friday night we went to Sonic and just fucking had a great time.
Saturday we went to Magic Kingdom!!!!!!!! I had never been to like anthing disney so this was exciting lol. We had a lot of fun, and I had to put pure zinc all over my body, cos I wasnt wearing the hoodie dun dun dun. and then i put 50 over that... man oh man was it gross. then we went to epcot around 6:30 walked around, and watched the fire works show at night. It was so awsome, Kara and I were blown away. Later that night we went to Jordans friends house for a bit... interesting kids... that all im going to say
passed out around 2 or so.
Next day we decideed not to do any disney cos I was so tired, and so was Kara, so since Kara had never seen Fantasia! what?!??!?!?! me and her watched it while Jordan got to see patrick? (some guy she needed to see)she introduced him to us, and then left. well, when they got back, he asked to come in. SO, he did, and he joined me on the back porch and we talked for like an ahour or so, while people were comming in and out of the room. Hes an in interesting guy, i can see why Jordan likes him <33 ha he looks like johnny depp... almost too much, he has the same hair as in secret window, same nose, eyes... its crazyy. but yea... i dont know, things got odd cosshe was worried that he had a thing for me, but people can just talk and not be like hinting at more..right? *looks around* He said hes comming to tampa to visit and such. whatever we will see
Bit, i dont care about any of that, cos Paul and I are probably going to hlloween horror nights next monday night! <333 man oh man.. that is going ot be fucking crazy. I miss you guys, give me a call. xox"

went to the alkaline trio/ my chem concert latst night... I think matt was sick, his singing wasnt as awsome as the last time, but its ok <3 
I went with Matt, his g/f amanda and Steve. It was great to see them again. At the beginning i grabbed steves hand and dragged him and my sister up to the front with me, stopped and ran into ashley! <33 I miss her so much, she is doing well, then i kost my sister, but yaned them through the pit, and got about 3 people from the rail, and called it quits... hah close enough. It was so fucking hot as usual, i just want in the modd for that shit, steve was trying to blow on the back of my neck to give me air and such. tall bastard <3 it was great, then i hand people pull me out, cos i had had enough... Went and saw matt and amanda, then tried to pull them up to the front, got held up about 3'4 of the way... This random girl, Falon, fame up to me and gave me her number, she was sweet and pretty, but really drunk. Next thing I knew she tapped me on thr shoulder and proceeded to suck my face. I have a fucking hickey on my lip. crazy kids at concerts. 
Paul and I went to see Waiting friday night, we enjoyed it very much so. Sat I went to visit home, and kara and jordan came... I was going to kid nap lizzy, but at the last minuet I decided that she should come over ona time when they arent there, cos i know i would ignore them for her, and since they had never been to my house before, id idnt want to do that (hahah lizzy your my favorite <333) then i came back and crashed
but i wasnt really sleeping, my mind was dreaming, and i couldnt move my body, but i was awake, and my eyes were open... odd... then paul called at like 12:30 he had just gotten off work.. so i pretended that i was kinda alseep, and got dressed we went to the hookah bar. it was cool and such, but these fucking bimbo bitches where like grinding on these ugly guys in the corner... we looked at them and agreed in a statement of :what the fuck: 
blah.. i need a nap

I didnt get to see lizzy, i saw everyone else, even nicole whom i hadnt seen in like 3 years... but no lizzzzzzyyy :( what a sad sad day.

"event","Amazing. So, went to breakfast at 2 this afternoon with a massive head ache, and didnt feel well at all. slept till about 6, and jordan came back. At 8 we watched cartoons, and drank wine. Then, we went to eat at about 10:30 11:00. Then we met in the cancer hut, where i called down paul, and he suggested that since jordan would finally be 18 at 12 that we went to Todds and bought porn. so,the three of us went back to our appt and dranka bottle of champagne at 12:00 in celebration, then went to get porn. It was so funny, we found the most disgusting one for like 10$... the worst part is, we announced it to the cancer hut, and there was 9 of us crowded around our tv at 2am watching porn, and when it started i realized that i had already seen it! and it was the worst porn ever, it was something the boys had bought steve-o years ago. oh god the memories. The odd part was something strange was in the air this night, and even before the porn everyone was hitting on eachother or staring or something out of the ordinary... odd. After the we traveled back down to the hut and sat around for a long time. Then at about 5:30 or so Paul and I ran to CVS for ciggs for everyone at the hut. It was a nice car ride, listening to me first atgg. then we came back and al contemplated sleep.. jordan left sometime around then, and me and paul went to his room to make coffeeeeee ( well, he made it, i watched)when we went bck out jeff had this great idea to watch the sun rise on the top of the parking garage, with drinks in hand we all went up there. it was so beautiful. I will never forget the site. The sky was a rainbow in its self, breathtaking and all because of the moments that were shared with whom i was with. I will never forget tonight. I dont think I am going to sleep either. I dont want to waste this feeling on sleep. I have never been so wide awake in my life, I feel like i could fall for hours and never hit the ground. what is this? How is this? I feel like if someone doesnt hold me down ill float away. I just have to remember to breath...

And I will try, to fix you."

I have been waiting for a long long time... and i think i have found what I'm looking for... however, that sucks too because, now that i have my mind set on something to look forward too, it also gives me something that will eventually let me down... I hate this so much. Peter is comming back from the military next week, or so i have heard... what then> whats going to happen then. He called me on and off for the hole time he was away, and he doesnt know that i have a clel phone now, so i dont know how he is going to get ahold of me... he doesnt even know that i go to USF. He was always the thorn in my side the size of a cadillac. Will he still have that power? and will everything i worked for to get away come fludding back, burrying me in the past?

I'm no longer fine, I'm no longer running smooth
I though that I found myself under something new
Just one more line I repeat over and over again
'Till I'm blue in the face with a choking regret
Because I talk in circles 'round you on my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

It's about time that you got sick of me
No longer fun, and so far from interesting
I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold
In disgrace with a shameful regret
As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time
And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time

And I don't dream since I quit sleeping
And I haven't slept since I met you
And you can't breathe without coughing at daytime
And neither can I
So what do you say?
Your coffin, or mine?"

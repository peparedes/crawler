Wow, it's been a really long time since I was last on here. I had to go update/change my profile and everything. But I missed being on here and reading all the awesome fanfics and updating my journal and stuff. I hope to be on here pretty often, although I'm usually so busy with school that I don't get to do stuff like this very often. But yeah, I will try to come on here as often as I can. I'm also on facebook and fanfiction.net, in case you wanted to know.

Like I said, I missed being on here. I'll try to post entries and maybe even some fics of mine on here more often.

Later!

"event","OK, the last entry wasn't really an entry. I was just testing that to see if it would work, and it did. I'm so stupid when it comes to computers. Oh well, maybe I'll take a crash course or something over the summer before college next spring.

I wanted to be in college by fall, but my mother actually suggested that I wait until spring 2005! So yeah, I'm actually gonna do that. I need to get motivated to do my work. I'm getting so lazy in school and shit that it's not even funny. I'm so behind in Word Processing and if I don't get caught up I may not graduate! And I HAVE to graduate!! I've waited too long to get out of here.

I think I may have an internet addiction?

Lee called me last night and we talked for almost 2 hours. We've only been friends for about 2 1/2 weeks now but we're finally starting to open up to each other. He told me a lot of personal things last night that I know were hard for him to tell me. But he must trust me, or he wouldn't tell me. Aw, now I feel special!

Mom told me that Joel called, but I didn't get to talk to him. Waah. Oh well, I'll call him tonight. Maybe we can meet up at the mall tomorrow or something.

I need to get my journal hooked up. The style really sucks right now. Catch ya later, I'm gonna go and *groan* do my work!"

So, prom. It wasn't too bad but I had more fun at my cousin's prom, last week. For one thing, I didn't have a date, and that sucked. I thought, well, it might be fun to go by myself. Yeah, was I wrong. My friend Amanda was there with her bf, Ben, who's a sophomore. They were kissing and fooling around the entire night, so you can guess how much fun I had. I danced on the fast dances, but when the slow ones came on I kinda just sat in the corner. I wish that I could have brought Joel but he never showed up. That pissed me off. Anyway, prom was from 8:00-12:00 but I thought it was over at 11:00. Our theme was ""When The Sun Goes Down"", that stupid country song (sorry!) by Kenny Chesney. The song wasn't too bad at first, but now I can't stand it. The prom was kinda Hawaiian, I thought it would look bad but it actually wasn't too bad. When I left, I got a champagne glass. Ben and Amanda left at 10:30, telling me they'd be back but they never came back, so I left. I danced with Jamie (this guy who's a Metallica freak) on the Creed song ""Six Feet Under"" (I think that's the title)?. Another thing that sucked is the live band we had playing kept blowing the breaker. I summoned up the courage to ask Jamie to dance with me, and when he did, the power went out in the middle of the song! That sucked. I was really tired when I got home, I didn't go to After-Prom. In my opinion, prom wasn't all that great but I went anyway. Well, talk more later."

Back to school. Joy. The weekend was OK, I guess. I went to that Senior vs. Faculty basketball game, and played in it. They started me out and I played pretty consistently throughout the game. We (the seniors) lost. I haven't played a really good b-ball game since 7th grade, so yeah, I sucked. I know I did, but oh well. I don't care. I don't plan on playing any sports for a long time. I'm not that sporty. Then after the game I went to the Senior Appreciation Dance. I didn't want to, but Hannah, who's trying to worm her way back into my good graces, wanted me to, so I did. I don't know why. I went to the same dance last year, and to the game, but I didn't pay attention because I was all caught up in Paul. Of course the music at the dance (this year's) sucked. They played mostly rap and country. I went up and requested a bunch of GC songs and the 3 Days Grace song ""I Hate Everything About You"" but the only song of mine that they played was ""Girls And Boys"". I've gotta work 2morrow, Wed, and Thurs. I hate my job! Telemarketing sucks! But I've only gotta do it until June 30. Next week is my bf's prom, I guess I'm going with him. Although my bff (my cousin) wants me to dance with her friend Joel. She said that his date's gonna ditch him once they get there. I tried to get on fandomination.net this morning, but it appears to be shut down. Waaah! That means no more GC fan fics for a while, unless I find some other site. (I know, I'm a weirdo) Well, I gots ta go, but I'll update again laterz!

"event","Well, let me just say that Easter break was definitely interesting. That's all I will say. I bought my prom dress, even though I have no date or anything like that. Oh well, I don't care. I'll have more fun by myself, even though this IS my senior prom. I bought my dress at DEB's though, and then I popped in FYE. I love going there, they have the BEST music! I bought Mest's Wasting Time, Punk-O-Rama 7, and Warped Tour 2002 Compilation. There were two girls next to me buying Good Charlotte, so I asked them which CD they were buying and what song they liked best. They gave me a blank look and said, ""Um, the song about the rich people?"" I almost busted out  laughing, but luckily they left. One of them said, ""OMG, this store like, totally sucks. Let's go to American Eagle!"" It was funny, especially the look that the cashier gave them. They didn't even buy the CD, they just put it down. 

*sigh* I've got work today. I'm so overjoyed. *rolls eyes* I have to do this, though, it's the only way I can make money. So I guess I'll just have to deal with it.

"event","So as usual, I'm sitting here with nothing to do. I thought that maybe I'd surf the 'Net and read a few fics or something like that, but the truth is that I haven't really been up to anything lately. I've been feeling really down and low, and I don't know why. I feel like I've changed somewhat...I can't pinpoint the exact time that I started feeling this way, I just know that I've been feeling different lately. I guess I could talk to Mom, but I know that she probably wouldn't understand. She says she would, but I don't think so. There's so much shit going on inside me that I don't think I could explain it to her anyway. But if I don't get it out, I'm going to end up going insane.

I also think that Hannah and I are growing apart. Sure, we spend time together and talk and laugh like always, but for some reason it feels empty to me. I feel like I'm just going through the motions. She's spending more time with her other friends, like Tina. I'm not jealous (well, okay, maybe just a touch), I'm sad. It hurts me that she went and asked Tina's advice before she asked mine. It hurt even more when she said, ""I need to talk to Tina about something"" and wouldn't tell me what it was. I wasn't trying to be nosy...I thought best friends shared everything. Apparently I was wrong. Maybe it's the age difference. Maybe I can't be friends with someone 3 years younger than me...or maybe it's just her. It's a fact that she isn't very mature sometimes. And she's bitchy a lot. We didn't argue like this last year....but then again, I had just met her. Now I'm beginning to think that I've seen her true colors. And I don't like what I'm seeing. I don't know if I should break off our friendship or not...I don't want to, but maybe that's what I need. Because I can't keep doing this. It's crippling me.

Melissa (26) and Lexi died but Gracie, her daughter didn't. I knew Lori, Melissa's sister, better than I knew Melissa, but it's still sad because that is such a young age to die. And the funeral (burial) was on Friday, Lexi's 7th birthday. I cried so hard, it was so sad. Little children shouldn't die  young. What did they ever do? They don't deserve it. And the rest of my weekend was shitty because there's never anything to do in this crappy town. It sucks. I think I am failing one of my classes because of surfing on the Net all the time. It's an addiction. And I just started posting my fics on fandomination.net, so that's mainly what is taking up my time. Anyway, gotta go now, before Mrs. Christle (librarian) catches me."

""Lie To Me""

Pairing: Benji/Joel (Benji's POV)
Disclaimer: I do not own them, this is not real.

""Lie To Me""

Lie to me.
Tell me that you still love me, that you'll always love me.
Hold me.
Wrap your arms around me and hold me like you'll never let go.
Kiss me. 
Kiss me the way you used to, before all of this happened.
Your kisses used to be so passionate, so full of love.
What happened? You're never home anymore. I never get to see you...it's as if you're avoiding me. Why?
Lie to me, Joel.
Tell me you didn't sleep with Billy.
Tell me that all you did was talk.
I'll believe you, because after all, we've never had to lie to each other. We promised we'd never hurt each other.
Tell me that you want to be with me and only me.
Lie to me, Joel,
Tell me that you still love me...even though we both know it's not true.
I need to hear you tell me all of these things, because I can't face the truth.
I can't face reality without you here with me.
Tell me why you stopped loving me, Joel. What did I do?
Tell me, Joel, so I can make it up to you.
Tell me how to get you back.
Lie to me, Joel.
Tell me you'll come back.
Tell me you're not gone for good.
Lie to me, Joel.
Tell me you still love me.

I know that sucked, but I wrote it when I was bored. 1st semester of school just ended and the big winter formal is comin' up this weekend. More later!

 ""Watching Over You""

If I could turn back time
I'd hold you in my arms for as long as I could
If I had known it was going to be my last day on Earth
I would have told you how much I loved you
And how much you meant to me.
I don't think you really understood
The depth of my love for you.
I'm so sorry that I took you for granted when we were together
And I'm sorry I was so possessive.
I only did it because I didn't wanna lose you.
You were my only reason for living;
Your love is what kept me going, kept me sane.
I didn't mean for this to happen, I swear,
I didn't want to leave you.
But sometimes things that are beyond our control happen;
That's just the way life is.
I think about you every day, babe, as I watch you from up above.
I can see how much pain you're in, and how you mourn for me.
I need you to know that I don't blame you for my death
And that I want you to move on and live a normal life again.
I can hear you crying every night, all alone in the room we used to share,
And it breaks my heart to see you like this.
So let me go, Benji, let me go so you can move on.
I know you want to be with me, but you were meant for someone else.
I still love you, and I always will, but I can't be with you right now.
There's someone out there for you, Benj, someone who will love you until we can be together again, and one day you'll find that person.
It will take a while, but eventually you'll learn to love again.
And until we can be together again, I'll be watching you.

I know that probably sucked major, but I was in a crappy mood when I wrote it. Any advice on how to improve would be appreciated!"

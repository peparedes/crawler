<b>I hope you choke on every word you spoke when you were screaming at me.
And realize how many times I've tried, but that's wishful thinking.
All I want is an apology for what you did and how you treated me.
Get me far away, or at least as far as this car will take me.
Tell all your friends about me.</b>

GOOD. thats all."

hm but anyways.
I'm still trying to decide if today ended up being a good day or a bad one. Well not so much bad, just like ah.. mediocre.

But i did ""hang out"" -if thats what you want to call it-with chrissy after practice. We didnt really do much just sit on the corner of fletcher street and call every person known to man with a car. Almost got like i dont even know. FINALLY GOT A RIDE. Chrissy tripped on the curb ahah and a drunk laughed at her aha but i miss hanging out with her so so much so its good, regardless of what we do and stuff."

"event","mmkay, well I give 99.9% of the credit to chrissy for helping me with this - all i did was pick the lay out i liked, she did everything else. [thanks again pal!] I guess im just dumber than i thought with computers, but im excited ive wanted one of these for the longest time :-D!!


aha, but anyways. I'm going to take <b>complete</b> advantage of this thing hah...
I woke up kind of late for me [1030ish] and went online like usual, went running and then had softball practice which was goood, i ran around a lot and chrissy couldnt throw because of her pinky and i laughed so much because she threw kind of crooked. i think the sun kind of got to me though cuz i feel kind of tired but whatever. 
then i went home quick and planned on taking a shower, but didnt. ugh, and didnt go to tommy's show :( but hey i guess theres always next time [still sorry!!]
but yeah so 
chrissy came and got me and we ate food and straight chilled and then around 7ish kell came over and we bonded a little. and then rich called around 730? and he picked us up and sorry rich but you kind of scare me with your driving. met up with kevin, and mike and ashley and went to this weird place and me and chrissy stayed in the car.. aha. and then went to dunkins then i came home and took a shower and attempted homework but had more important things to be doing :)

i took so many pictures this weekend :)

ah but i will for sure talk more tomorrow, paayce."

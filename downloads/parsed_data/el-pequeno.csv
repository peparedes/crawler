"event","why hello... it has been a while since i have written in here but my life has been incredibly hectic lately. It is just go go go and it seems like i have absoulutely no time to myself. I have a lot fo stuff to do for school lately.. it just seems never ending and i have three mid-terms this week as well *sighs*, then as some of u may know i got a job at campus crew so i am balancing work with school and then on top of that we are trying to sell my house and a lot of things are going wrong and i have been helping a lot with that...plus everyone was worried crappless about my cousin's and his girlfriend's baby ... seeing as though they lost their first baby one week before it was due... from the heart just stopping and they could never find out why... but that worry is over! COOPER JOSEPH TEBBUTT was born on Febuary 21, 2005 at 3:40pm and weighed 7lbs and 12 ounces. So that is a relief...finally postive. But needless to say any little time i do get to myself i am soo exsausted that all i want to do is sleep.

I have been neglecting my friends in a sense because of how busy i have been but it is not like i have been doing it on purpose. there has been conflicts but we talked about them and the majority understand because they heard me out... i am hanging out with some of them this week and i cannot wait... it will be awesome to just chill and be with friends...for they never fail to make my smile and laugh. but i got to get going... i need to go and finish an assignment before i get to go out YAY! lol... he he yeah i know i am a geek but u all love me for it :oP"

"event","hey i know it has been a while... but i have been really busy... not that i actually have a job and am balancing it with school. yes i got a job.. tis at campus crew and i am loving it so far.

in the last one i said how i had a lot of things to talk about... well now i have came to the conclusion that the majority of those things i do not want the whole world to know.

tonight was a very eventful drama filled night that held a lot of surprises and frusterations causing a lot of pain and anger. unfortunately this had to happen on marta's birthday.

i have been thinking and i have found that the bars and clubs... welll going to them all of the time causing a lot of pain and stress on friendships ...welll.... any realtionship in particular. I am thinking of cutting down on going to the bars because i think it would make life just that much easier. now dont get me wrong... i love the club and stuff but it is honestly not worth all the pain and sorrow and conflicts. i am not going to cut it out entirely but i think cutting down is only for the better.

yes i have had a lot of things going on that have been bringing me down into the dumps... but onw things is for sure... i can thank my baby for helping me through this. you help more than u know. u make everything seem like it is okay and make things just that much more easier to deal with. my friends are great too... but with him is a different bond...one where he always seems to understand no matter what... a soul bond..."

"event","this week has been a week from hell. i have been sick out of my mind and hardly able to get out of bed each day ... including losing my voice entirely for the week and having to do presentations was hell. but that i can get over... i have received so much bad news this week that has just left my family and i in a week full of tears. there are two people that i care for soo deeply that are hurting so horribly right now... and then there is my grandmother out west ... and then i found out some bad news about a good friend of mine...wishing i could have been there but being buried so deeply in sorrow myself.. for the first time in my life i didn't know what to do or say. this person also tried to reach out to me during a time when i was a total mess but in a sense i guess i could say i regected it because i was such a mess and i didn't know what to do or how to express myself... but i guess they just took it in a wrong way.

last night just added to everything. my boyfriend and i got tricked into going to this kickboxing tournament. with one of his friends lying to us about when it would end because he knew that if it ended later we wouldn't have gone. with this event ending at 11:15 and having to drive from the other end of cambridge and having to drop off one of the guys that came with us(at this point wishing i could have driven) i didn't arrive home until 11:45... at which point i was glad to see my parents home so  could take my car. but i arrived home only to find that a horrible fight had broken out between my parents and things were scattered everywhere. i did end up getting my car keys after getting into a huge fight with my dad. I drove like a friggin crazy person with my boyfriend holding on for his dear life, to get to wax because i wanted to see my girls so incredibly badly in which i hadn't been able to see because of the hectic week i have had. I arrive at 12 and luckily when we arrived they started letting more people into the club... we got in and looked around to find that they had just left...oh how i had a feeling that this was going to happen.

well anyways i must be going to do some homework..."

""Crash and Burn"" by Savage Garden

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned it's back on you
Give me a moment please 
To tame your wild, wild heart


I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't 
Take anymore


Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone


When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one-way street
With the monsters in your head


When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like you can't face the day


Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone


Because there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again


When you feel all alone
And the world has turned it's back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild, wild heart


Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone"

"event","Today was the start of classes for my second semester at college. It was rough enough having to get up to go to an 8:30am class when i have been used to sleeping in for the past two weeks ... let alone the fact that i absoulutely could not sleep last night ... that last time i looked at the clock i do believe it was 5:00am and i had to be up at 6:30 to shower and be ready by 7:30 in order to leave and make my usual timmy's stop and get to class on time. I just have so many things on my mind and no matter hjow hard i try to relax myself i just cannot get these things off of my mind. My professors so far are seem to be really cool but are more hardcore than last semesters teachers. Like I already have homework coming out of my butt in accounting and computers. YES COMPUTERS.. the second half of the class in which i did like practically nothing in and still got a 90 in. Well this time we have a different prof and he is like hardcore into it and assigns a lot of assignments and such. But in a sense it is a good thing that this one is not as laid back because people will take it more seriously and have more respect for this prof. The other one got walked all over.

Also i just wish this lingering cold will go AWAY. The bad part is that when i work up this morning my cough was worse ewww... but anyways i should be off to go and do some homework and to make a tea because i still need to wake up...lol.. yes i do realize that it is 3:30pm but oh well...lol"

"event","The fact that i have found someone that I actually don't mind spending my time with, want to be with, and have been with for a while is amazing. I have actually found someone I love being with and I definetly do not want to leave. By this time in a relationship i am ready to pack my stuff up and leave... and now i have actually found someone i want to stay with. I never thought this was going to happen. And the weird thing is ... he is one that i kept leaving all the time in the past. We were constantly on and off and now... now i can honestly say i know what love is. I thought i knew before from a previous relationship but it all changes once you actually experience it. It is one amazing emotion but it makes you feel so vulnerable.

I love the fact i can talk to him about anything and not be judged, I love how his hugs and his kiss seem to make everything seem okay, I love the way he loves me for me...

The other night when we were sitting at a Tim Hortons... we talked for hours... and I mean hours... we showed up there at 11 and then next thing we knew it was 4 am... we lost ourselves in eachothers presence. We talked about anything and everything and not once did we feel uncomfortable.

Some people may say I shouldn't post entries like this... but i say WHY NOT?! I am not afraid to let others know how I feel."

"event","Well yesterday I had a job interview for Vector Marketing. They told me over the phone that there is a first interview and then if i make past that and then there is a small presentation that i have to go to and then there is a second interview. Well i had to sit thourgh everything and i never thought that my interview would go from 5:45 to 8:30. Agh it was hell ... lol. But during the second interview i had to answer some more questions and then at the end of it I got the job and they said that they feel that i would really succeed and that I am more advanced in the aspects of talking and relating to customers WHEN I HAVE NEVER WORKED SALES IN MY LIFE ... lol ... okay then.

Now for a description of the actualy job ... which is nothing like I thought it would be. I am selling products from CUTCO. It is the world's finest cutlery. They also sell sporting knifes as well. Now at first I have to find three people to go INTO their houses and present these knifes, show how they work ... let them see how it works and try them. Then I hope they decide to buy them and then I have to try and get them to reference me to their freinds and family and that is how i get other customers. They say that from the 3 people i should naturally have 6 others customers because naturally you will gain two more customers from each customer. Not only is that kind of retarded but I am going into strangers homes ... people i do not even know and sell knifes and present them and let them try them ...  like that is really safe like common. It is not really for me and plus i am not nieve enough to do it.

LOL ... so hence forth i am still looking for a job ... LOL"

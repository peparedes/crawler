A typical Monday. Nothing to brag about. More bad dreams and sleep headaches. &nbsp;I have a 5am on site time tomorrow that means 4am up and rush out with no last minute laydown or 3:30 rise with my usual morning&nbsp;routine. Hmmmmm.

Hills:
A&nbsp;very, very ,very busy day at work. We were fully booked out with fit-ins squeezed in here and there. Julie and I were a buzzing&nbsp; and our feet never touched the floor.&nbsp; It ran quite smoothly though. 
Got some praise from John the big wig at Head Office this morning as well as Kylie , my immediate boss. Seems both liked my monthly report from September. It was my first and according to John it was &quot;just what I was after.&quot;&nbsp; I&nbsp;also got high praise from one of the patients I helped this morning. The patient had an appointment with the senior doctor and told him I&nbsp;had a beautiful personality and wonderful telephone manner. Okay! So who's head is getting big? Hmmmm, any guesses? .Yeah , I know . Tomorrow will probably be a shit of a day and knock me back to earth. I&nbsp;am pulling a 10.5 hr day tomorrow...... BUT, it was nice to get some positive feedback and feel appreciated.
Got my hair cut on the way home and then dropped into Cooroy Medical Centre to show Jacqui&nbsp;the ropes and give her the passwords for the computers. They are now opening next Monday. I&nbsp;had no heart tugs while there. In fact it made me realise what a big job it is going to be to get the place up and running again. I&nbsp;do NOT&nbsp;envy them.
Back home to a very tired Debs and dinner.

G'nite."

A good but quiet day at the office which was great as I was able to catch up on some paperwork. I needed to update office protocols and get a disaster recovery pack organised. Today I got a good start on it all.
No word from Head Office on the other matter. 
I kept getting updates from Debs who was spending a day off from paid work and decided to spend it working herself to a lather around Ravensnest. I think she knows how much she is appreciated. Right darling?
Home to BBQ pork chops and a salad.

A very good day. I got a lot of paperwork done this morning and this afternoon Trish (Centre Operations Manager)and Carolyn (Human Resources Manager) from Head office phoned to see if they could meet with me this afternoon. Oooookay, come on down, I nervously said. 
About 3.30 they arrived and asked if they could speak to me in a separate room. By now my mind was spinning.
They offered me a promotion. They want me to be Northern Area Manager. I would still be manager of Cooroy Medical Centre but I would also be asked to visit and take care of 4 other centres in my area and help the other Centre supervisors manage their centres. They would answer to me and I would answer to Trish. There would be a weekly meeting at Head Office and, to get me off the desk to allow me time to travel and such,  I would be able to get more casual staff at Cooroy. It is a very nice salary package with a car provided but I have asked to see a detailed written proposal before I make up my mind. One thing they did say was that I was the one and only choice for this area. The other supervisors did not have the experience. If I refuse they will advertise externally. It left me feeling really really good but I am still not committing just yet although I did tell them I was interested.
Got home early tonight to a wonderful T-bone steak dinner Debs had cooked on the barbie.

Debs:
Same as every other day this week. With a couple of exceptions ........ Out of the blue I got a cuddle from Ross Homer, the roller guy. No reason. I was just standing beside the road and he came up and put his arms around me. AND, a stallion came up to the fence-line where I was standing and tried to hit on me. Banging his belly with his extended penis and baring his teeth. When I walked away he started banging the gate with his hoof, wanting to get out. He definitely wanted some action!  I definitely did not want to be in the same paddock as him.
Came back home and tidied up the dog's corner in the yard. Levelled off the dirt, cleaned out the kennels and placed them against the house. I also shovelled a few loads of soil onto the trailer. 
Seems like I may have a day off tomorrow as the guys have a meeting in the morning."

Very quiet Monday. Coped fine by myself. No problems. The locum doctor we had forced upon us by head office saw a whole 4 patients today. I am so annoyed. Meanwhile Doc David wasn't even fully booked. His pay to sit around twiddling his thumbs is coming out of our profits. Grrrrrrrrrr. Don't get me started.

We took Syd to see his nana and grandad and he was a big hit.Mum spoiled him rotten and yes, he had his own serve of beef wellington which was on the main course today. Entree was a blended scallops and cream wrapped in salmon and topped with caviar. Dessert was cheese cake topped with blueberries. Of course it was all washed down with a nice drop or two.
Syd had free roam of the fenced back garden while we were eating and it took us by surprise to find him peering at us through the front dining room window. He had escaped and had come looking for us. Turns out their back yard is not 100% dog fenced at all! After that he stayed inside with us and got spoiled by his nana.
Home by 4.30 for a few chores, play with the pups and to simply relax.

Back to work tomorrow, Debs is back on the  Kin Kin ranges while I start at 7.30 tomorrow morning and fly solo till 6pm. Not looking forward to it.

"event","Chatted with Dina and Dave this morning on the telephone. Actually Debs had been on the phone to them for quite a while before she came through to the bedroom, woke me up and shoved the phone in my face. Have you ever tried to hold an intelligent conversation when you are half asleep and your brain refuses to work? Try it sometime, it's ...... interesting.
Bacon and eggs for breakfast before setting out to do a bit of shopping. Took Debs' truck and popped into Cooroy for a few items and also bought a large piece of plywood to go under Debs' side of the bed as she finds the mattress too soft and wakes up with a back ache.
Back home and it was straight into chores. Debs started the washing while I cleaned the mouse cages. She then had to cut the plywood to the right size as I cleaned Baby's cages. More loads of washing and a newly made up bed with plywood base for Debs.
We are going to mum and dad's tomorrow for mum's birthday and want to take Syd so Debs gave him a bath as well. He is now all shiny and glossy and ""smells purdy'.
Late in the afternoon we sat outside at the back of the house with a couple of beers and turned on the fishpond fountain and our bamboo water feature. The fountain needed a clean out to get it working properly but soon behaved itself and sprayed like it was supposed to. It was nice and peaceful. We couldn't sit still long though as we remembered we had a Raphis palm to plant in an empty pot. Poor Debs buggered her back again bringing me some soil and placing the pot.
Debs is cooking a pot of beans tonight and the corn bread has just come out the oven. We are going to sit in the ""posh"" room tonight and watch a couple of DVDs. Not sure which ones yet. So many to choose from!

The day started very early with a lovely cuddle with my huney at 2.30am this morning. Fell asleep that way too.
A busy Friday. A fun day though. I enjoy working with Kerry, the Nurse, as she really works well with Doc Graeme, her husband. The result is an enjoyable day. 
Phoned my mum this morning to wish her a happy 75th birthday. We are going to lunch on Sunday.
We got a complimentary email today. We were actually complimented by head office, who had just had a meeting with the contract cleaners, on having a wonderful clean and tidy centre and of always being polite and kind to the cleaners.  We were one of only three AMC centres, out of 22, who got one. Think about it. We, as all centres do, run around every evening making sure the place is tidy and clean before the cleaners get in. Hmmmmmm. What is wrong here?
Anyhow..... TGIF.

I was woken up the right way this morning. TY. 
Another fun day at work. The only downer, if you could call it that , was a stupid 16 year old girl who came in for her meningicoccal immunisation and freaked out when the nurse came toward her with the needle. I mean a real panic attack of gigantic proportions, The ridiculous thing was, she had a nose ring and a belly button ring which must have caused significant discomfort to get. Stupid silly girl wasted a $50 vaccination as she refused to have it  after it was drawn up. What the hell is wrong with stupid blond anorexic teenagers these days ?....or any teenager.   Nope, I am not a fan of today's teenagers. Grrrrrrrrrrr, I feel like I should send an account to her mother for the $50!!! Calling her a stupid girl is being too kind to her....... AND yes, I have compassion when compassion is due. Comes with the job.

Early finish. Home by 6pm.

Nothing major went wrong and the work went smoothly. Still toting a back ache. Was attacked by jumping ants today and itchy grubs. Wind played hell with us picking up signs this afternoon.

Caution Big Head posting.  I sorted out our old Genie software problem simply by backdating the Server running the software to before the license ran out. Hey presto it all works! so simple it was silly! The doctors are very happy. Then Noosa Medical Centre, an Australian Medical Centre sister centre, wants me to become their supervisor. I declined and Anna, Cooroy's Nurse, told them to butt out, ""she's ours"". I feel sooooooo loved. Yes it was a good day. It was one of those days that happen once in 5 years. You finally get to know you are appreciated. Add to some funny one on one emails with Trish, the Centre Operations Manager at Head office, and it has been a very good day.

A very busy day. Also a frustrating day butting heads with Head Office. In a nutshell, H.O. want us to NOT use the previous medical software. The license has expired and we have no access to the old records. The doctors need these records for patient care and safety. Legal correspondence and workers compensation documents are also included. It's a stalemate! H.O. do not want to pay a license fee for our doctors to use the old software. The doctors are demanding access to their old records. Fun, fun , fun.
A late finish. I didn't get home till 7pm.

"event","Sunday sleep in. The dogs went outside at 6.30 this morning. I also took the opportunity to uncover Baby in his cage. I was going to let the cats out but I saw a flock of King Parrots at our bird feeding area so left them in. A quick pee then it was back to bed. An hour later Debs was up for a pee, the coast was clear so she let the cats out. We slept in till 11.00ish.
On rising the plan was for me to go get the papers and the week's fruit supply while Debs cooked brunch slowly. It worked a charm and I was back at 12.30 to a spread of bacon, eggs and sausages, not forgetting the hot coffee.
After lunch Debs decided to wash the dogs...... and cats. Poor Damian and Maggie are still moping around the house. Then it was a dump run. At the dump we found a somewhat dishevelled looking bird cage which with a bit of cleaning up will be a great carry cage for Baby.
Back home I went to feed the fish in the dam a loaf of bread but once again there was no movement in the water so it looks more definite now that we lost them during the drought when the water level was so low.
Inside the house Debs was pottering around with her work folder, adding new stuff such as the work directives and code numbers of all the roads and work orders for the council. She loves being organised.
Later on we put the first of the Lara Croft DVDs on while surfing and reading the papers.

Dinner tonight was roast beef. Debs cooked it on the barbie, sprinkled with garlic. Delicious. Over dinner we put the second Lara Croft in. Geez, we could watch that woman 24/7 !

"event","Debs was up earlier as per normal now on a Saturday morning when she calls the folks back in the US.
Our first task of the day was to take lil' Piglet to the Vet to get his nails cut. Normally we cut our dogs nails but Piglet has a reputation for being ""quick"".  It was quick and easy and he didn't put up any fight at all with the Vet which makes us feel that we could do it ourselves next time. Stay tuned. Picked up a few things at Officeworks and did the lotto before popping into the Medical Centre to do some photocopying for Debs' work. Then it was off home to leave Piglet with the other dogs and swap vehicles. We took Debs' truck back to the Ag place and bought some Dog food, wild bird seed, kitty litter and giant round bale of mulch hay. The guy put it on the back of our truck with a forklift. Back home we were able to lever it off the truck and place it beside the chook house. Next week it is going to be rolled out over the pile of soil that the bobcat operator is going to spread for us. That should keep the soil safe from any torrential rain and help it vegetate.
This afternoon I did the usual pet stuff like cleaning out the mice cages and Baby's cage and stand. Meanwhile Debs was outside giving the John Deere a make over. She had the ride-on on the ramps and she was under that thing cleaning the cutting deck and blades. She took the belt cover off and cleaned out months of dead grass and dirt. Then she got underneath it with the pressure washer. Finally after it was cleaned, she spray painted some of the scratches on the frame that were just wear and tear from two good years on the job. It looks like new now and it took her most of the afternoon.
I stripped the bed and started the washing while Debs was still at the JD. In was when she finished JD that Debs decided to semi drain the fishpond again. Siphon out half of the water and refill with fresh water. So while this was going on we hung out the washing, started a second load and then sat on the front porch with the dogs and Debs put her photocopies into two separate folder. One for her and one for Ross, her partner.
This afternoon we also decided to move the clothes line and we marked out a spot behind the garages where the bobcat man can dig us a hole when he comes Monday. With the fishpond refilled, Debs did the week's filing (the filing cabinet is in the garage) while I wandered around trying to be helpful.
Finally at 5.30 we ventured indoors for the day.
Roast chicken in the oven , sandwiches made for the week and laminating of another copy of Debs' photocopied paper plus an updated CD list and the day was done.
We sat down with our chicken and watched two light movies tonight just for the fun factor.  ""Finding Nemo""   and ""The Incredibles"".
It is now close to midnight and we are heading off to bed. 
A good day.

Stopped in at the council depot to bid farewell to Les Andreasson ( Hoss ). 'Bout time that old fart retired. Him and I have a love affair going. He gets me in front of a crowd of men and asks when I'll have dinner ready. I give him a time and when he asks what's for dessert I play the shy...don't tell anybody but it's me for dessert hunny....

"event","We were up early as we had the pump repair man and the bobcat man coming first thing this morning. I handled (not physically) the pump man. Our house water pump is leaking and as it's 12 years old it is probably on it's last legs. Got a quote coming on repair of old and supply of new. Should hear something tomorrow.
Meanwhile Debs handled the bobcat man. We wanted a quote of moving the 10 cubic metre pile of soil and the humongous 20 cubic metre pile of wood chip we still have behind the house. Both piles have been sitting there for about a year. $100 quote accepted. He'll be back next week.
Both guys were gone by 9am so Debs then decided to jump on the ride-on and cut the house paddock. An hour later not satisfied with that she then got the weed eater out and cut around the dam. 
I was having a lovely time chatting to my sis, Dina, and watching the storms on the radar. 
Debs was finished by 11.00 and we both got ready for our ""first date"" lunch at the restaurant beside the Noosa River. 
It was extremely busy at Harbour Town so we had to park illegally (fingers crossed) and we made it to our table only 10 minutes late. Lunch was superb. We opened with a superb serve of garlic bread. It was served up on one of those cooking stones and on the stone was also a handful of pistachio nuts, roasted in the oven. We gobbled those down as much as the beautiful bread. 
For main course Debs had rib eye fillet, cooked rare, with mushroom and red wine sauce. She was in heaven. The meat was so tender and juicy. She also had a side dish of organic mixed lettuce salad.
I had a tossed chicken and prawn curry served on a bed of noodles. Delish! My side salad was rocket with roma tomatoes and parmesan cheese. Hubba hubba. All the above were washed down with a very nice sauvignon blanc. We had no room for dessert or coffee and waddled back to the car after a most scrumptious 90 minutes.
On the way home we got some cheeses and crackers for supper this evening, a carton of my fav red wine and a carton of Debs' fav beer, a few items from Officeworks and some more petrol for the ride-on. Why? Because when we got home, Debs jumped on the ride-on again and cut the top paddock and the outside verge. Meanwhile I unpacked the car and took a load of rubbish (old chicken wire Debs uncovered Hills' hill with yesterday)  to the dump. Debs was on an absolute high all day. It was great and she did a wonderful job on the grass today. It saves us from a busy weekend. Love that woman!
Early bed tonight. We both have work tomorrow.

Another busy day. I found out today that Claire, our newbie, married an American 12 years ago, from Pennsylvania even!. They lived over there for a few years till he got fed up with the cold so they moved to Australia. I forgot what area she said they were from but it was somewhere between Lake Eerie and Pittsburgh. She knew Spartansburg though. Aint it a small world? 
It was a very hot and stormy day. All the patients were coming in and REALLY enjoying the airconditioning. For once they were glad the doctors were running late. LOL.
Mad rush at the end of the day as I had to do the fortnightly reports and get to the mechanics before they closed to pick up my car after its service. I also got a CD player installed too. Yeah.
RDO tomorrow but have a couple of tradesmen coming early morning so no sleep in. Debs and I are also having lunch at Trios on the Noosa River. Must leave home by 12 Noon. More storms predicted.

Debs:
Its always easier knowing the next day is a day off. i helped Mugsey haul limbs and rubbish he had cleared up the bank of the road, I didn't have any traffic from my end (dead end) of the road road. It was hot and muggy to the point of misery. I pulled up at work and first thing I did was accidentally run over a King Brown snake (Australia's most venomous!). The ""pop"" made me think I lost a tire. I like snakes. They have a purpose in the circle of life BUT had I not run over him I would have put my foot down on him.
Home to clean the bathroom, cut some grass and clear away the barrier on Hill's hill ( the one she broke her ankle on) . She has been fair warned. One step up and I'll fix it so even the next owners can't use it to walk on.
A nice sleep i tomorrow........

Wowser, what a busy Monday. I was squeezing patients in all day. The doctors left exhausted and glaring at me. Yeah boys. You had a hard day for a change.
It was hard with Debs being out of phone range today on her birthday but it made the homecoming damn sweet this evening.
Tired. Early bed.

Debs:
I woke up feeling nice and cool. Thank god for air-cons. The minute I stepped out of the bedroom I felt the humidity. I knew then it was going to be a hot one and boy, was it ever.
I was out of range all day, so I missed my Hills and our texting habits. Like teenagers sometimes. As soon as I got home I got a birthday call from my boss. Naughty Hilary for telling him 
( grins wide ). Then I got a message on the home line. A lovely song all the way from the USA. I love you Dina and Dave. Thank you. I'm going to keep it on our answering machine.
THEN I checked my email !!!....1 card from the kitties, 1 card from the pups, 1 card from the Baby the bird, 2 cards from America and 1 card from Hills. It brought tears to my eyes.
The cards from the babies where soooo cute.
 So here I sit with the air-con on thinking how lucky I am to have people like ya'll around me....and Hilary as a soul mate is the iceing on the cake.
I get chinese tonight for my birthday dinner. Oh and I got a card from her mom and dad, a $100.00 check and a reservation for 2 (fully paid) at the restaurant ""Trios On The River"". This will be Hills' and my birthday dinner on Wednesday because Hills and her father were too sick to go on her birthday.

"event","Sunday.........a day to potter around the place.
Debs was up at 8.30 and she woke me up at 9.30 to let me know that coffee and breakfast was ready. Fresh coffee and butter milk pancakes, which we enjoyed on the front patio.
Then for a while we went our separate ways. Debs went outside to potter around with the pots,filling them with the potting mix we bought yesterday. She also manufactured chicken wire covers for the pots so the cats and chickens can't dig in them. Then she dug up the trunks and roots of the bushes we cut down in the bathroom garden. Meanwhile I was in the house first washing up and cleaning the kitchen then cleaning the mice cages and Baby's cage and stand.
When I did manage to get outside Debs had saved the sowing of the seeds in each pot for me. Isn't she sweet.
We shared a beer out in the back patio and Debs had a wonderful idea of setting up our bamboo water feature. It is comprised of about 5 bamboo poles of various lengths running into each other with the aid of a pump. We put it beside the fishpond and it looked good. We then got the old fountain and pump and set it up in the fishpond itself. Ahhhh, the sound of running water in our garden.
We did a green waste dump run with all the pruned bushes and such from last weekend. On the way out Debs pruned the grevilleas that were encroaching across the driveway. We ended up taking quite a full truck load to the dump. I thought were finished for the day seeing as it was going on 4.30 but oh no.........I remembered I had to clean out the deep fryer. Love that job...not. Debs also rearranged some furniture. One of the recliners was put out in the sunroom as a reading chair while the recumbent bike/rowing machine was brought into the family room in it's place. There is no excuse for not doing our exercises now! Baby's cage was moved over to the front windows beside the recliner in the sunroom while the treadmill was set up in the cage's original position. It all sounds complicated but it works.
A cool/cold shower was welcomed by both of us after we had finished.
Steakette sandwiches/burgers for tea followed by an evening of computer time and the sci fi channel for entertainment. An early bed tonight. An exhausting but very pleasing weekend."

"event","What a brilliant day. I woke up to find Debs already up and talking to her maw and pop.
We headed off to Maroochydore after that, leaving home at about 9.30. On the way out we got petrol for the car and breakfast for us before driving down to Noosaville to drop off two packs of double coated chocolate Tim Tams to the guy that replaced the shattered screen on Debs' phone on Thursday.
We hit the Sunshine Motorway and arrived at Maroochydore where we first went to Bunnings Hardware for a compost bin and a curtain rail plus a few incidentals like potting mix and pots. Then we drove a kilometre down the road and visited Sunshine Plaza and enjoyed a browse through the mall. Bought Debs a new mobile phone (I get the old one as mine is over two years old). Her new phone is on the Next G network which means increased coverage especially in the more remote places she visits for work. 
While at the Plaza we also picked up the DVD of ""The Lake House"", some clip on shades for Debs' glasses, white bed sheets  and a cute lil' antique looking red small counter top bin for the kitchen for our food wastes (for our new compost bin) and a couple of 2007 Christmas tree ornaments/keepsakes.
We were not finished there. Off to Wises Road and our monthly visit to ""Meat World"" to fully re-stock the freezer again. I kid you not when I say we whizzed around that place like a whirlwind. Before we knew it we had $235 of meat packed in the back of the car, which by now was getting over full. On the way out we saw """"Pet World"" so of course we had to pop in there and spend up on the fur and feathered children. Uhuh.
One last stop before getting home and that was at Cooroy , nearly home. Popped in to the grocery shop and bought the weeks fruit and a few other incidentals we needed. Home by 4.30pm. What a big day out!
Once the meat and groceries were put away we sat outside with a couple of cold beers and played with the dogs. They each had a bone too.
Not too tired, Debs decided she would put the compost bin together while I got the washing in from the day before. She wasn't satisfied with that. Oh no! Then she decided to mount the curtain rod and in true Southern fashion, we hung the bed sheets we bought and made curtains to close off parts of the house we didn't need wide open when the air cons are on. They look pretty good too.
Dinner tonight was steak, cooked on the barbecue, and salad. It was delicious. We sat down and watched ""Norbit"" and ""The Lake House' again. A very good evening.
It is now 1.15am Sunday and we are pooped. Time for bed. A big day.

A absolute terrific day. It was quiet and we had a doctor away sick making it even quieter. I managed to get a few household chores done finally. The Reception area got a massive clean-out and tidy up. I was a woman on a mission. Everything not used recently was tossed out and I labelled every nook and cranny to state what was where. Not finished yet as the lower shelf is next on my agenda. Maybe tomorrow. Early finish, home by 6pm.

Debs:
We where on Lenehans Lane, a major short cut from Noosa to Cooroy. We where doing shoulders ....I HATE SHOULDERS. I don't know if Ross was feeling off or what today, but I handled most of the signs. When we pulled up to pick up or put out a sign he had something to do and asked me to grab it. I didn't do them all but i did do most. Aww well...
First up this morning we had Energex (local Electricity company) on our end of the road with 8 trucks and using another company as traffic controllers. We managed to stay out of each others way till my crew shifted up the road a bit. The ute driver of the other company came to me with hands on hips questioning me about signs and speed limits. I think he was just playing big shot with the competition's lil' guy ( me ). So when I interrupted him mid-sentence and told him to ""follow the rules mate and speak to my ute driver about it"", he had nothing more to say. Why do we have to show our ass to get respect from people?
Okay bad morning over and I was looking forward to a busy but less eventful afternoon......NOT! At 1:30ish Ross came over the radio with "" that lexus just ran my stop sign"".   As per usual I turned my stop sign to him and he stopped about 40 paces from me. Leaving my sign on stop I motioned for him to come closer. He just sat there. So I headed for him. Thinking I would keep it on a light note, I planned to crack a joke about needing to lose weight anyway before asking him if he saw the stop sign.
When I got to the car he sat with window up for 5 minutes finishing a phone call b4 talking to me. I simply asked if he knew he ran a stop sign ? All Hell broke loose. He began screaming at me .......saying the sign was on Slow. From there I tried to calm him with ""Sir, im not screaming at you so please don't scream at me"" and "" Lets be kind here"".  Nope, more screaming and pointing. As he screeched away I mumbled ""Dumb ass"". He heard it. He slammed on his brakes and got out of the car. A 7 ft 2"" football player type in his 60s.
Game on then...........
I told him that the sign no longer mattered and that it was now between him and me for his treatment of me and he's the reason people die on the roads . Cell phones in their ears and can't see stop signs. When he was 2 inches from me and getting angrier I called for help. ""I need someone up here gentlemen"".  HA!  Johnny pulled up in the grader, Ross rolled up in the ute and behind me came a council ute from another job. Mugsey was hoofing it over and Mal was climbing out of his roller. A moment later the asshole was gone. We all went back to work and I was just fine. Unlike other crews where it upset me for the whole day this time it was okay. In this job you have to stop people and confront them.  Then you have to stand up to them or you never make it.  In fact it's Evolution's rule - correct them when they're wrong and give back what you get.
It wasn't till later that Ross told me Les ( site supervisor ) agreed his sign was on Slow, not Stop. Okay, so the guy didn't run a stop sign but he was still on the phone and abusing me. I tried to be nice. I would have just said "" Then I'm sorry sir.  Have a nice day"". We're not perfect out there but were not dogs either.
Very tired tonight. Early bed."

Not enough sleep. Started out doing road shoulder work and finished off in the bush. Truck making a clunk clunk noise in the front. Dropped in to the Mechanic on the way home and he tightened up the belts. Still making the noise when I got home. Not much else to write home about.

"event","Debs got me up this morning in a devious way.  She stripped the bed, sheet by sheet, pillow by pillow......... with me still in it!  I got up.
We fed the dogs their weekly treat and put Baby in his outdoor cage for the morning. Got a few pics of Piglet playing that we are going to give to his ""auntie Janet"". Good action happy pics.  Then we decided to head straight out to fill up Debs' truck (my car was filled up yesterday) and head for the rubbish dump.  Upon leaving the dump Debs was looking through her rear view mirror and spotted a bag of rubbish. Don't ask me how but somehow we left one of the bags in the truck.  Too embarrassed to go straight back, the bag enjoyed a free trip to Pomona as we got the fuel and popped into the grocery store for the week's fruit.
Back home for lunch. A had a couple of classic Cary Grant movies on the TV, House Boat and Mother Goose, during and after lunch. I haven't seen them in years and I got a good chuckle as I cleaned Baby's cage and play stand. Debs had already made the week's lunches and was now outside in the heat hanging out a the bed sheets and then getting her truck ready for the working week. Then she put the week's coffee grounds around the pot plants and sprayed the tomatoes with epsom salts (magnesium sulphate) to give their leaves a boost. To keep busy I watered the chooks and filled up the 4 wild bird feeders for the week. Charlie and Danny , our two roosters, love it when we do this because the old seed is emptied on the ground and they have good pickins'. 
Debs was very industrious today as I wilted in the heat. She re-pruned the bougainvilleas again. They are shooting thank goodness but from the base only so she cut off all the old limbs. I thought she was finished after finishing this task as I bought two ice cold beers out. Oh no. Off to the garage she went and got the bow saw out and sawed off at ground level the short bushes around the bathroom garden and got the blower out and tidied away the leftover leaf matter. Now we sat down and finished our beer. A storm had been brewing but unfortunately it skirted us and all we got was a few drop drops of rain.
Back inside for a shower for me and a salt bath for Debs before we both shared the cooking duties. Cajun Fish. 
Sat down to watch the Australian Rugby League Grand Final but it appeared to be heading for a one sided slaughter so flicked stations after half time.

Another weekend gone. Debs is working in Cooroy tomorrow, probably within coo-ee of each other. It's going to be hot and humid. The new girl , Claire is on tomorrow, so I may go in early just in case.
Early bed tonight.

"event","One of the most beautiful sounds in the world is distant thunder , gradually getting closer, early in the morning on a sleep-in. The eerie sky as you walk outside, let the chickens out and look up at the darkening sky. The absolute joy of literally jumping back into bed and snoozing with three dogs and two cats, all in our bed. Remember that Syd is a 95 pound dog!  I think we each had a square foot of bed. No alarms, no schedules. Then the loud clap of thunder that wakes you up again and the heavy rain on the roof that makes you get up again to close the windows that we left open on a very hot night. Ah yes. Love it! We love thunderstorms but there is nothing like an early morning storm.
I was up first and Debs slept in till later. It was my turn to cook breakfast of bacon and eggs which we had in the sun room. Then it was shower x 2 and off on our lil' drive to a couple of places only and then no where in particular. Itemised for ease..... LOL.
1. Saturday papers at Cooran.
2. Take drive down Lake MacDonald Drive at Cooroy to ascertain Debs' job for Monday. Found the heavy equipment so she has a starting point.
3.Stopped in at mum and dads to deliver the newspaper and some info garnered on-line regarding fish pond vacuums. Very funny chat for 30 minutes. Yup, mum called Debs ""Ms Lumpy Labia"". 
4. Stopped in at Noosa Electronics to get a refund on a dud battery pack.
5. Visited the Dollar store for a few things.
6. Stopped in at ""Pets 'r us"" and bought Baby an outside cage/aviary for days we are home. He screeches the house down when we are on the outside porch with the dogs. He wants to be with us so he now can be. Soooooo, he now has a $300 ""holiday house"". Met ""family"" at the pet shop and exchanged email addresses. Also bought an exercise wheel for Screw the mouse.
7. Took the country drive home and tried to find Lake Cooroibah. Took a wrong turn and never found lake but ended up driving along Doc Graeme's road and tried to have a ""sticky-beak"" at his house but couldn't find it.
8. Headed home and arrived by 3.30pm.
9. Set up aviary on porch.
10. Tidied up dog run. Picked up what seemed like a whole skeleton of bones and old chewed toys and cleared yard ready for mower. Got on ride-on and cut dog run. 
11. Debs used chain saw to level off wooden step that stopped me getting ride-on out of dog run. My hero. Thank you Les and Mugsey on the Grading Crew that serviced her chain saw at work one day. It worked beautifully.
12. Sat out on porch with dogs AND BIRD , having a couple of beers each, while Debs applied more clear varnish to Mugsey's boomerangs he has made for us. We have real boomerangs made for us by a real aborigine. None of this fake looking tourist crap.
13.At sun down we headed off in the truck and did a bit of pruning on the fig trees that were hit pretty badly during the frosts of last month. Then we hauled a young tree onto the back of the truck that finally, despite all our efforts for the last two years, fell over, literally. 
14. Put the chickens away. G'nite boys.
15. Both had a hot bath.

................settled down for the evening in front of the TV. 

Another thunderstorm moved through this evening. Poor Katie is so scared of thunder. Debs made her a make shift ""bunker"" with a towel wrapped around the base of Baby's play stand. She spent the night in her shelter. 
Watched a most wonderful movie on Movie One tonight, ""The Lake House"". I must have it on DVD.  I bawled my eyes out and was desperate for a happy ending.  We followed this with our video of ""When Harry met Sally"". A very good nights entertainment.
An excellent day. We enjoyed ourselves and  ....... we enjoyed each other even more. 

Sunday tomorrow. What can we do together.

G'nite all."

TGIF. Left Debs sleeping this morning and went off to work, satisfied she would get some help today.
The day went well although the morning was spent worrying about Debs. 
The new girl, Claire , was doing orientation at Cooroy this morning and she did well. She starts Monday morning at 7.30, solo till I get in at 9.30.
The rest of the day went quite quickly. Once Debs told me Doc Ann' diagnosis and treatment AND that she was home safely, I started to relax and enjoy that Friday feel. I did manage to get a 30 minute lunch today and whizzed off the the Pharmacy and got Debs some strong pain medication. I also got her a bottle of whiskey while I was out. LOL.
Things were going nicely until about 4pm when the last few patients of the day took forever to go through and all of a sudden it was 6.10 and we were locking the back door.
Home to my favourite Potato and bacon soup and a bowl of salad.

Meanwhile Debs spent the afternoon trying to take her mind off the downstairs pain by doing a load of washing, cleaning the cat room and mice cages!!! Hummpphhhh, so much for telling her to take it easy.

Silence from Head Office today. Makes me think something is brewing. All in all, a good day.

Debs: I really want Ross to get back to work. The stress level with this guy standing in for him is out of reach. We did nothing but handle signs today because he didn't get it right the first 10 times. Then to top it off, the crew decided to stop communicating with us... after lunch the grader driver came up to me...."" btw debs, we're back-tracking and filling this drain"". So the 30 minutes of sign hauling and shifting before lunch was useless. Not wanting to go through involving J and more confusion I just walked our signs back.

"event","Sunday.... up at 9.50am.
We fed the dogs their chicken and rice first  thing this morning. They took turns, littlest to biggest and all got full tummies. Then I headed off to the dump with the rubbish and on to Cooran to buy the Sunday papers. On the way out I noticed we had a stray cow in our top paddock.  Interesting.  In the meantime, Debs cooked breakfast, steak and eggs, and  we enjoyed the meal in the sunroom watching an episode of Voyager.
Then it was today's chores ..........
We tried multiple times to herd the cow out our gate but the stubborn beast refused to leave the grassy paddock. So we decided to leave her there until the owner came looking.
I jumped on the ride-on and cut certain areas only on Ravensnest that were starting to look overgrown. Debs was 
busy washing my car and starting the laundry. She did a wonderful job on the car, even blackening the tyres. I was just after a quick hosepipe.
I noticed Alan was next door feeding hos cattle so Debs went down to speak with him. No it wasn't his cow. probably Kevin's, two properties up from us. Turns out it was Kevin's ""mongrel"" of a cow that is always escaping and no fence can hold her. ""She'll come home at feeding time this evening""
I cleaned out the ""grease trap"" or the deep fryer and the pressure washer came in handy with that as well. Lol. 
Debs decided that we also needed to clean out the fishpond. It was green and she noticed a couple of goldfish at the surface this morning ""gasping"". So Debs siphoned out the water and caught the fish. During this time I was cleaning our poor neglected barbecue that had not been cleaned in weeks. Pooo-weee, what a greasy job! Debs pressure washed the grill plates to get the excess shit off before I used hot soapy water for the rest. 
The pressure washer was coming in handy today.  We even pressure washed the fish pond, blasting the algae to oblivion. The water plants were cleaned up , nice fresh water added and the fish put back, all within an hour. Not bad. We sat down watching the pond fill, enjoying a couple of beers. Debs had a brain fart and decided to move a few pot plants from the back pergola to the bird feeding area to give it more of a bushy garden look. Looks good too.
Next came the chicken's feed and water for the day and finally the dogs pool and water. We took more drink and nibbles to the front pergola and played with the dogs. Oh, we also planted out a hanging basket while l out front. By this time the sun was going down and our day of relative rest was drawing to a close. The stray cow even went home!
We ate our nibbles too late in the day to think about the pork roast we were planning tonight so, after a lovely hot bath, we sat down in front of the TV with more nibbles and leftovers to suffice any niggling appetite. 

It's now 8.50pm and we are both yawning our heads off. Looks like an early night to get us ready for the working week.

We haven't done a big grocery shop in a while so we headed off to Gympie. Hilarious trip up the highway reminiscing about our lives. We got the giggles talking about how our sex has changed over the years.
Bought way too much at Big W variety store, including a lot of treats and toys for the fur and feather children. Loaded up the car and then up the escalators again to Woolworths and our grocery shop. Strolled up and down the aisles and had the trolley/buggy packed full. Annoyed that we couldn't find guacamole sauce. (I call it guacamala, LOL). Spent way too much again.
We didn't get home till 4pm, probably because when we realised we had forgotten the week's sandwich meat , instead of running back into the store we drove 30 minutes down the highway to the next grocery store just for the heck of it. But hey, we also found the guacamole sauce there too. Yep, one of those stupid days.
We had a small storm this afternoon when we got home so there went by grass cutting. Instead, while Debs unpacked the groceries I cleaned the bird cages and mice cages and helped out wherever I could.
Then we both went outside and planted our tomato bushes with the pots and soil we bought today.
As I type this, Debs is in the kitchen. She has made the lunches, cut up the fresh fish for the cats, is cooking the two chickens to put with a bowl of rice for the dogs treat tomorrow and soon she is to start on tonights dinner for us , tacos.  Yup, she's at home in the kitchen.
Hopefully a few more storms will blow through this evening. We love a good storm when we are both safe at home. We will watch a couple of movies tonight, eat and drink way too much and generally veg out.

Extremely infuriating day with Head Office today. I wrote an angry email to the HR department at head Office and spoke my mind. That email got a swift response from them on the phone trying to pacify me. Other emails I have written all week about other issues have been totally ignored. The communication between the different departments at Head Office and the relevant medical centres really, really suck. I am really getting fed up AND so is everybody else at Cooroy Medical Centre. We are all hatching a plan to move to a new medical centre in a neighbouring town. It's fun dreaming. I am looking forward to the day we all put in our resignations to Head Office at the same time.  ***sighhhhhhhh**** 
TGIF

Debs:
Rode hard and put up wet! Going  to bed with my front out of alignment. Yada yada yada ..........

TGIF.

A good day altho I was worried not hearing from Debs all day. The usual 3.45 to 4.00pm text to say ""I'm Home"" didn't arrive till 4.20pm so I was worried.
Staff meeting today at lunch time. We sorted out a lot of shit today.
We also had fun today. There was a lot of joking around with both doctors and patients. A good atmosphere.
Buffalo wings tonight. yummmmmmy

Debs:
J is a full on character. He takes a lot of work to train. He's a good fella but jeez, I'll be glad when Ross is back.
Saw a record size red bellied black today ( snake ), very close to 3 metres long. Not a happy chappy either.
Another day of hard at it work with double everything, men and equipment wise.
I'm glad tomorrow is Friday.
Also another day of being out of reach from my Hills via phone."

Extremely quiet day. No problemos.


Debs: It seems I must have said something right to my boss about J as they're issuing him his own ute tonight. Its been a busy, busy day. We were working between 2 other sites. We also had twice the equipment, 2 graders, 2 water trucks, 2 loaders , 2 tippers. We had a ton of workers and council traffic ALL over the place. Out of service range for mobile service so I missed Hills today. Seems we did nothing but run all day. Tired doesn't describe it tonight."

Helluva busy day. We ran out of chairs in the waiting room.
It was non stop all morning and we even had patients waiting their turn outside sitting in their cars. Amazingly we survived and the back log was cleared by lunch and the afternoon was a lot quieter. That's another day down.

Debs:
 I worked with J. Jackson today as my ute driver. Ross ( my every day partner) has the flu from hell. "" Jacko"" is from Mississippi with most of his family in South Carolina. What a talker he is. Needless to say by the end of the day him and I both had our old accents back. Funny how being around each other did that.
Today was also his first day as a ute driver, so i did my best to show him the ropes. I'll have him back tomorrow so I think I'll stand back and let him work it out. I gave him a glowing report to my boss on the phone today. Pray he continues to do well.
Work finished early, so i popped in to the local grocery shop to get salads and side items for the next few meals.
Home, and I sat down ...... early bed. I want to get in some reading but I find 5 minutes after opening the book I'm out like a light."

Busy but steady day at work. No major problems and we had fun. Two of our regular doctors were back from study leave today and the place was jumping.
Home to find Debs cooking our dinner of T-bones on the BBQ. Yummmmmm.

Debs:
We had 4 cars go through our site today. The stand in grader driver for the day was so slow it was like watching paint dry. Makes for a very long hospital waiting room style day. Got word today that Les will store his bus at our place. Ummmmmmm. Boy , this is exciting shit aint it.................................."

"event","A WONDERFUL DAY !!!
A combination of early morning distant thunder and doggie's upset tummies meant that sleep ins were going to be a hit and miss. Debs...was a miss. Once she's awake , that's it. No more sleeping. Me? I can sleep for HOURS longer. The result? Debs was up at 6.30am to play on the 'puter, sleep on the couch, watch TV and well, whatever. Later she phoned Dina after hearing of Davo's latest. Me? I snoozed on.......oblivious. Debs woke me at 10.00 to tell me the latest news.
After a huge Sunday brunch of bacon and eggs with biscuits/scones, we headed off for our promised Sunday drive. We went to get the Sunday papers first at Cooran , then filled up with fuel at Pomona, before heading off to ""Debs' office"" for a look-see.
We drove up Tablelands Road to the Look Out before four-wheeling it along the forest drive. We spent the next 90 minutes driving, stopping, taking pics, driving, stopping, taking pics, etc, etc , etc.......... we even managed to negotiate a tree blocking the road........eventually coming to the main road.
Quick re-route back to Pomona to get some beer before heading home via Cooran Trading Post where we bought 
a mounted whale print , a set of sherry glasses for our bar and a Stephen King book.
Back home we shared a cold beer and a play with the dogs before I watered the plants and Debs put the pork fillet on the barbecue to cook.
Tonight as we watch Star Trek Voyager : Season 7 on DVD, Debs has had an unsuccessful time trying to load pics of today's drive. She will try again tomorrow. You will just have to wait patiently Dina  **wink wink**.
Pork fillet and corn on the cob tonight. Yuhummm. Delicious.

Back to work tomorrow. A quick but good weekend
G'nite all."

"event","Saturday.......slept in, cuddling and snogging till 10am upon which we realised we had far too much to do today to sleep in,
Chores today...
Go and get Saturday papers, change bed, clean mice cages, clean bird cages, clean cat room, start washing laundry, straighten up young tree flatten by high winds, clean and give fresh food and water to chicken run, empty recyclable glass and paper containers to outside bins, sweep floor, put in a border between lawn and gravel in the dog run, sort out our pills for the next 4 weeks, set up new bird feeding area, fill up bird feed bin with corn and seed, paint the star picket driver that Debs bought off Mugsey last week, bath the dogs, fill up their swimming pool and bowls with fresh water, made the lunches for next week, and finally, have some time with the pups.
It has been a good day, with enough done to ensure a more relaxing day tomorrow. We are sore and tired but feel good.  Medic!!"

First up I discovered blood and bedlam in the mouse cage. Cork(ey) was being attacked by his son Screw. So badly that he may lose half his tail and his flank has a nasty deep sore. I brought in the second cage from the garage and separated the two boys. 
Then I took Debs UHF radio she left behind this morning to her at ""her best office in the world"" location up on the tablelands at Cooran. It was a beautiful drive and I envied her that morning.
Work was okay. It went well and on schedule until the last 30 minutes. Then a lady came in who could speak no English. She was accompanied be her husband who spoke broken English. From what I gathered at reception she has a tick on her bottom. Okay I thought, no problem. Doc Robin will pull it out quickly with a pair of tweezers. 
Yeah right. An hour later and the deeply engorged tick had been cut from the lady's bum. It had apparently been there a few days and, with the lady being on the large side, it had been pushed and shoved further under the skin, embedding itself deeper everytime she sat down. Poor Doc Robin went through so many vials of local anaesthetic to get that cheek numb!
Late closing the centre and getting home, but hey, it Friday!! Yee haaaaaa

Debs: Not much to report on today. I'm still achey but thankful it's friday. We had wonderful views from Tablelands Road this week. I think a drive with Hills will be in order on Saturday. Tired as usual but content with a near full weeks pay to come in.

Spring is here and I had the spring cleaning bug today. I totally reorganised the front desk reception area today. It has been looking too cluttered lately. I am only half way through but it is looking much better. 
Head Office has finally taken down the humongous signs at the front of the building that has blocked our view from the front door and looked so tacky, AND......... we are getting a new exterior coat of paint soon.  My oh my, aint we spoiled.
Good day at work. Friday tomorrow.   :)


Debs:
HOT! Some of the boys are suffering from the sun too. Poor Mugsey could not eat his lunch due to being over heated. It wasn't a very pleasant day. Dead sheep made the valley smell pretty bad. We are thinking they have suffered from the recent floods. My joints hurt. Maybe time for Ross River Fever testing OR.....I'm sore from recent work done around the house STILL.
The sun is draining me, so I'm off to bed early these days. Its good to know its not just me...."

so even though i gave my 
two weeks notice about a month ago
i've still been working at my job
they've been understaffed and i
wanted to help out because i respect
my manager and a few of my coworkers.

until today when i finally just walked out

there was a line of people throughout
the whole cafe, all bitching about
their lattes not being hot enough
or how their whipped cream melted

and my coworker was freaking out
shaking and messing everything up
i offered to help and he cursed me out
i called the manager over to help
and he treated me like a child
i dont like being patronized.

i finally got tired of being treated like a tool
and dealing with <b>incompetence.</b>"

i dont understand how people perceive me at all, 
i guess it's the lack of ""brain to mouth"" filter,
 because i say what i mean, and i tell people 
the truth about what i see, it seems like if im
 not pushing someone away, they are leaving me 
behind for someone else, and i'll probably just
 end up deleteing this in a few days, because for
 the love of god who wants to be vulnerable on 
the internet.. i guess its the last attempt at 
letting myself know that i tried, and that im not 
good enough, at least i can say i want to be a good 
friend, shannans car broke down today, and i drove 
to howell, used my triple A card, waited for her to
 get her car towed, called the mechanics and got 
her car set up with someone who will fix it right,
 and then waited with her until she felt like
leaving, then drove her back to her house.
 i mean.. if thats not showing someone that
 i care. i dont fucking know, i guess in this 
world actions don't speak louder than words. 
maybe i should stop being so expressive,
 maybe i should fucking look straight
 ahead of me and keep my mouth fucking shut.

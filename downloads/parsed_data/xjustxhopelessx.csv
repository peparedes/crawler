I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOOD GUYS ANYMORE!!!!!!  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!

As if i needed this bullshit right now.... Haven't talked to him today, don't care, don't want to know, FUCK HIM!!!!!

Dad didn't get his pace maker put in today after all... Blood thinners they're giving him are working WAY TOO WELL, his blood was too thin, couldn't risk it.... They also tested him for the new defibrillator/pace maker.... Weird ass test... It took it's toll on him, almost killed him... Had to actually use the paddles twice.... That's some messed up test.... Dad was scared shitless.... Looked like a little boy wanting reassurance that things are cool... That's pretty sad..... What kind of position I am in to tell him things will be fine, if i don't even know.... Dr said MAYBE he'd put in the pace maker Thursday, so that's another 2 days atleast that Dad will be there.... Will be a week on Wednesday.... I'm going crazy from going to and from hospital... I can only imagine how he feels being stuck there.....

TODAY SUCKED BIG TIME!!!!! 

I need new friends, i need people to escape with, i need a new life!!!!!

HELP!!!!!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!"

"event","Well Dad is still in the hospital.... I've been spending most of my waking moments over there.. Turns out Dad needs a pacemaker... He'll be having it put in tomorrow... Dr says Dad's heart paused for THREE ENTIRE SECONDS....Dr says that's not good... Doc says if he was standing, that's enough time to cause him to pass out... Dad says he's lying in bed and feels like he's falling asleep as if he's really sleepy and can't keep his eyes open, then all of a sudden snaps out of it.... That's when his heart starts beating again....Doesn't look too good...Dad's not feeling all that great but dr's say the pace maker should change that... I hope so... Dad goes crazy when he's alone, especially in a hospital room, has been there almost a full week... Wednesday will mark the week, looks like he's going to be there until then... So of course, Mom and I go and keep him company and greet other family members/visitors... Mom is tired... She's not getting enough rest, gets there early and leaves pretty late, doesn't want to leave Dad alone anymore than she has to and of course I'm usually right behind her, can't let her go nuts along with Dad, need to keep her company.... And that's because I get that uneasy, queasy feeling when I walk into hospitals... Too many bad memories/experiences there... It all comes back to me everytime I walk in there.... IT SUCKS!!!! But I can't be selfish.... Been killing time while in Dad's room studying for finals... Not like i'm retaining anything.. :-(  And have a final tomorrow.... I wonder if i can postpone it... I know i'm not ready for it... ""Studying"" takes my mind off me being at the hospital, yet so many things are racing thru my mind.... Can't really concentrate.... 

Grandfather (Dad's Dad) had heart attack, quadruple bypass surgery then a stroke, paralyzed from right side, then had several strokes after that.... He passed away in '88.  RIP Abuelito!!!!  

Grandmother (Dad's Mom) also had heart problems and ended up with a pace maker.... She lived about a year after the pace maker was put in... Passed away in '01... RIP Abuelita!!!!

So you can imagine how he's feeling.... Talking about how he'll be lucky if he can even last 5 yrs longer and then says IF I EVEN MAKE IT OFF THE TABLE.... He's stressing too much and making me stress.... I don't like to think about things like that... I've had to deal with death too many times in my life.... I'm not ready for another.... So i'll be back in the hospital in a few hours.... Dr said procedure to put in pace maker will be tomorrow morning... Mom wants to be there early.... They might even have to put in a new type of pace maker / defibrillator where he actually would get zapped as if they were using paddles and trying to revive him... First time i've heard of that... Pretty freaky and scary at the same time.... Dr says it feels like a straight  punch to the gut...  

Well, i know it's been long... needed to vent i guess.... Gonna do a bit of homework, say my prayers and catch a few Zzzzz's.... 

PS More prayers are very welcome ;-)"

"event",""" 'De Nile' is not just a river in Egypt""  LOL  Happy Birthday to meeeeeeee!!!!!!!

Well not a great start for my birthday... Just got home from hospital... Dad was admitted, was pretty close to having a stroke/heart attack... He's been sick, but lately been getting worse... He's changed his ways for the better but I guess it's been too little too late... His heart as the dr's are saying is in ""BAD SHAPE"" and weaker than ever... They believe he has a clot in the artery (arteries)... Will find out tomorrow morning, he's having a procedure done, i think it's called a balloon angioplasty... Hopefully they can take care of it that way, plus he's heart  is beating WAYYYY faster than normal, he's actually hit 140, when any normal person's heart rate hovers around 100 when stationery... And his HIGH HIGH blood pressure doesn't help... So if anyone is reading this, say a prayer, keep him in your thoughts... He and I have had our differences but I wouldn't wish anything bad on anyone... Hope everything comes out ok...."

LOL  We too picnic stuff to the beach but of course the kids are having too much fun to take the time to eat, so we got together and friend's place and fed the kids, ham & cheese sandwiches and pizza and then had banana splits and sundae's for dessert.... The kids loved it... .I dropped off the munchkins at home around 11pm and they were still wide awake, probably wired on all the sugar they had.... What I like is that I get to send/take them home and I don't have to deal with that.... I'm just the Aunt.... LOL  I'm tired... Not ready for bed, just wanna relax.... Hung out with some friends on Saturday... Had dinner and just hung out and talked... Alot of catching up we did... Friday worked on a friend's computer and other friends showed up, so it turned into a blockbuster night... Saw the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre... YES!!!! The one released not too long ago... I finally saw it... Freaked me out.... Made me anxiou the whole time, the suspense was killing me and I still felt anxious afterwards.... Where was everyone when I needed some company???? I forced myself to get it out of my head and decided to just try and go to bed.... No help sitting here online messaging people and getting no replies.... Not just one buddy, not just TWO buddies, not just... ..... .... ... well u get the point.... So yeah, I had to deal on my own....

Saturday, I went to my best friend's place and had a front row seat for the De La Joya fight on the big screen... I didn't win any money :-(   but I felt like drinking, had some Michelob Ultra's, actually lost count... (I guess i'll call that a cheat day... went over on the carbs... LOL) But was well worth it, hadn't had fun in awhile.... Was headed home and got a call from Jaime.... he had just got out of work asked if i wanted to hang out, was in such a good mood, i headed over.... So we played on computer, talked and watched some MMA competition dvd's..... pretty interesting.... Said he could show me some positions if i wanted... (MMA= Mixed Martial Arts, in case u're mind is in the gutter) LOL Hung out... Came home late...... or early morning should i say... LOL  I was pulling into driveway as sis-in-law was driving up to drop off the munchkins... So needless to say I was going to be getting NO sleep... LOL Went to church and took the kids.... I knew I was in for it before I even walked into the church.. Had my hands full the whole time... Did I even pray??? LOL  I also registered for Confirmation classes.... So yeah.... I'll be going to church now regularly... Something i've been meaning to do and finally decided to just do instead of procrastinating... Took the kids to a birthday party in the afternoon, was there alllll afternoon....Was fun but was winding down fast.... Drove the kids home, I came home, showered and passed out.... Busy weekend.... Those are usually the good ones... ;-)   This morning I went to gyno with best friends... I heard her baby's heartbeat.... I wanted to cry... So exciting.... So happy for her.... Can't help but wonder if i'll ever experience that..... :-(  So yeah, was happy but bummed after that..... But things got better :-D.... On the way home, Jerry called.... Wanted to do something on his day off, invited me to a movie and lunch....Saw Raising Helen.... Was good... NOT great, but not a bad ""rainy day"" movie....Made me feel better... It was cool.... He picked the movie.... Sweeeeeet, something he thought i'd like to watch... Good choice... (I wanted to see the Day After Tomorrow, but he had already seen it the other day when he couldn't get a hold of me.... UFFALE!!!!!) LOL  But atleast I was able to make it this time... Was cool to hang out... We talked computer geek BS, he's wanting to build a gaming computer from scratch.... Was telling me all about it but couldn't believe i knew what he was talking about... I knew more than he did... He was only telling me what someone else had recommended... LOL  Was funny.... So then we were surfing for parts online... and talking, and .... we talked about some deep stuff that was and has been going on with him.... I swear, I should study to be a counselor.... :-P  I love hearing what's going on with others... It's interesting how everyone's lives are so different, yet in many ways, their the same....Got home around 7pm..... Now just taking it easy before the kids are back tomorrow.... Should be reading for school.... But, NAH!!!!!!  Maybe later.... LOL  Life is good, things are looking up.... New car, more interaction with some  friends, good times.... Wonder if it's my outlook, my weightloss or the new car.... Or a combination.... Hmmmm, i'm not complaining.... And I now can watch ""Talk Sex with Sue""... Could things get any better????? LOL"

---Keith Urban 


I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate

I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you 
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah

And you're gonna think of me
Oh someday baby, someday"

I'd Rather
----Luther Vandross

I thought sometime alone
was what we really needed
you said this time would hurt more than it helps
but I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
of a beautiful story
and so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (alone)
and I tried to find 
out if this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
and thought she could replace you
we got a long just fine
we wasted time because she was not you
we had a lot of fun
though we knew we were faking
love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
so I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you, 
I can only prove the things I say with time,
please be mine,

I'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you,
than good times with someone else (I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime),
than safe and warm by myself (so sure baby)
I'd rather have hard times to gether,

"event","well, it was a nice day after all, but kids never showed up... and noone called to tell me they weren't coming... so yeah.... i was awake waiting  for them.... at 7am, i realized they weren't coming.... went to bed.... slept thru most of the day... now i'm bored, bored bored.... and brain hurts.... bro's gf wants to get rid of her car so she can get a new one, but doesn't want to trade it in, she won't get what it's worth.... bro asked if i would be interested in taking over payments.... hmmmmm..... i want to... but the question is.... CAN I AFFORD IT?  he said to think about it and let him know, or he'll have to maybe offer it to someone else... it's a 2001 Nissan Sentra, Gold, great condition, one owner.... only bad thing is, it's standard/manual drive... which i'd have to learn.... great gas mileage, which is what i need right now... and would be more reliable than my old piece of junk.... Been thinking of all kinds of things to get this done.... and it's great cause she's not asking for anything down, just wants me to start taking over, so she won't have to pay it or lose money on a trade in.... My ass needs a job... I'm not going to get a decent car like that with my credit and without a down payment... and i'll be transferring schools probably within the year so i'll need a reliable car.... Perfect opportunity... But ya, just not my luck... Gotta think positive and figure something out.... I want it.... Plus maybe i can figure something out, dad's friend wanted to buy my old heap... Maybe i can sell it and use that for a few months payments ... Hmmmmm... We shall see....Other than that... just here at home with time to kill.... I should be reading or studying or something... Summer session already started at school.... Gotta be a nerd.... LOL"

"event","very interesting weekend... friday went to nephew's tee ball game.... ran into an old friend... we talked, exchanged numbers...yeah... :-)  went and hung out with best friend, her family and some other friends we know... had dinner watched movies.... friend i ran into at the game called... i met up with him after i left friend's place.... we hung out... we drank, we talked, yadda yadda yadda, got home at 5:30am... had fun... 

Saturday, nephew had another game at 10am, so yeah.... having taken a nap, i was ready for it... (ya right) LOL  so i watched my nephew's last game of the season... they lost :-(  they're only 4 and 5 yrs old... doesn't phase them, they're having fun... it's so cute...came home hung out for awhile, figured i'd take a nap.... friend called, her daughter wanted to talk to me... she wanted to know if i wanted to go to her softball game... couldn't say no... so there i go... two games in a row... 4pm-7:30ish....good games, just ass was tired... LOL  came home, hung out for awhile....was invited to have dinner with some friends... hung out there, had dinner, watched a movie... came home kind early... i was falling asleep on the couch... but i get home and i'm wide awake... i get a phone call from EX bf......wierd.... says he saw me the other day...Said i looked good... LOL hmmm, i wonder why he's calling.... LOL what's up with the ex's calling???? LOL  he was very civil, had a decent conversation and he said he'd like to keep in touch.... in the past 2 wks, guys i used to talk to have come out of the woodwork... am i in heat??? LOL they want to ""hang out"", the want to  ""get together""... but i'm not so forgiving, i'm not so forgetful... i think about why we stopped talking, why it ended.... and i don't want to deal with them ... but i don't want to be bitter and i don't want to be a bitch about things... should i go out? have fun? should i just see where it goes? should i atleast give things a chance??? not that i nor them is expecting a relationship or anything like that... but should i just see where things go??? i have nothing to lose... and it would give me a chance to get out of the house... maybe make or be friends again... we shall see...

Sunday.... my plans....
hope the weather is nice like it was yesterday.... i bought the boys a kite each... i got the Justice League one for oldest nephew, he loves Superman and i got the Ninja Turtles kite for the youngest....nothing extravagant... beginner's kite flying... now that i think of it, i should've got one for me... LOL  so i hope to take the boys out and play with the kites and want to make hot dogs on the grill and make them a picnic, they love that.... and as per the little one's request last time, i will get them marshmallows so we can roast..... and make s'mores too... :-)  God, i hope the weather is nice... i'm looking forward to it.... they're so fun, they make me forget all the stupid shit that  i have to deal with...  So that's my weekend... Wish i had more things to do like that  on most weekends... Maybe things are looking up... I need fun and friends on weekends... LOL  That's my only escape... Might have to start making my own fun and making some new friends....."

"event","am i that shitty of a friend that i can be so easily ignored, blown off and completely avoided??? or is it that i'm not needed until noone else is around???? the one on the back burner and/or at the bottom of the list...  funny how noone remembers me until they have problems or need someone to talk to... How I wish they all could read this... I sit here and worry about them, listen to them, no matter how late or how long they want to talk... And some have the nerve to say ""but why would u care""???? or NOBODY cares.... If nobody fucking cared NOBODY would be sleeping instead of listening to them pour their hearts out about every bad thing that could possibly happen in this world, NOBODY wouldn't take the calls when they want to vent and complain about others, NOBODY would not give a damn and just say FUCK IT and FUCK YOU for bothering me with it.... But yet, here i am... Maybe I should become a counselor/psychologist and get paid to listen to this... Lord knows noone appreciates it... I need a drink........BADDDDDDD!!!!!"

friend is bored, i'm bored, u'd think that 2 friends could hang out and do something fun.... not likely.... i guess it's more fun to be bored at home....So another weekend with nothing to do and even if i had something to do, noone to do it with....i should be used to it or GET used to it.... Everyone has a life but me..... So sounds like a perfect evening for a drive..... A looooooooong drive....."

It's been awhile again... But I should have more time to play online now that most of my finals are over... Actually all I have left to worry about is my online course...Sucks that it doesn't finish at the same time as my regular classes... Still have an exam and an final to get thru... And i'm registered for summer classes, so i'll have a short break before hitting the books again... Nothing really new going on with me...

Well, I did make a new friend... Went out, had fun... Had several phone conversations... Now he's gone :-(   Don't know what happened or what's going on...  One minute he's calling every chance he gets... Now 2 days without a call.... Oh well... I called and left a message and no call returned YET... LOL  Probably wishful thinking on my part... He was cool, we had fun, thought i'd have someone to hang with.... Guess not... Same old routine for me.... What should I expect at age 29?????

And ex called.... Mr ""Cocky, too good to deal with anykind of bullshit, don't need a gf but yet sends flowers"" called... And said he's been thinking about me and has been worried.... What the hell that means, i don't know... He wants to get together... I'm so bored, i might take him up on it next week.... Butttttttttttttttttttttttt............. i think he's expecting something... LOL  We shall see.. He was being WAY TOO NICE.... Didn't seem like his usual self....Hmmmmm......"

since you've been gone
I'm doin' fine now -- I've finally moved on
It's not so bad -- I'm not that sad 
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain -- I'm free again 

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath -- to forget 

Don't think I'm lyin' 'round cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really all right
I've never looked back -- as a matter of fact

This product is indeed called the classic chic vibrator.

The name classic chic means nothing but the term vibrator is important. This does indeed vibrate, which is nice. It has a variable speed knob on the bottom that allows slow or fast vibration.

Although viibrators are used most often on the clitoris (outside the vagina), this particular type of vibrator allows penetration and vaginal stimulation as well. Sizes vary from just larger than a finger to very large. The most common sizes are approximately the size of an average man's penis. Actually they are usually a little longer but you don't usually put them all the way in.

Many such products use 2 ""C"" cell batteries prompting the following joke:

A woman walks in to a hardware store and asks.

""Where can I find two ""C"" cell batteries?""

""Come this way"" the clerk says motioning with his finger.

""If I could come that way I wouldn't need two ""C"" cell batteries"".

Too too funny... ""friend"" and i were laughing our asses off... LOL  I'm addicted to the site now... LOL"

great...
now i know one more place/person where my opinion isn't worth crap...

maybe it's time i just keep my mouth shut and listen...there's a first time for everything and i think it's time for this...

would be nice to occassionally have someone listen to me though... or sincerely ask and want to know what's going on in my life... most ask but don't seem sincerely interested, more like a common courtesy to ask...

night before last, i needed to talk... to someone, anyone... noone was around... :-( or just too busy... i don't like to call attention to myself, i don't like to take up people's time or should i say ""friend's"" time... so i sat here frustrated... quiet... watching people in the chat rooms, trying to distract myself by checking out sites, trying to ignore this new eye twitch that has developed (stress-related, no doubt), wanting to just pass out and have time pass me by... the more i tried to sleep, the more awake i was...6am comes around and it's time to keep an eye on the rugrats...(neice and nephews) watching the kids on no sleep, mind u...4pm comes around, bro calls to let me know the nephew needs to be at game by 5pm... fair warning would've been nice... get kids ready, get myself ready, i need to get to my night class at 5:30pm... bro will meet me at the game then i can proceed to my class... get kids packed in car...ALL 3 and their ""luggage""... halfway to game field (teeball) and i realize i didn't grab my books... so forget the idea of coming back home for books... can't turn back around cause nephew will be late... can't come back after dropping him off cause then i'll be late anyway... i give up... i skip class and stay for the teeball game... i needed that... was fun... come home... decide i'm gonna have some time for myself and then finally get some sleep... when low and behold... ""friends"" are calling left and right... ALL thru the night...how convenient is that??? the shit story of my life... these one-sided ""friendships"" just aren't cutting it for me anymore..."

"event","I found this poem and was so appropriate... 

Alone
I know this place from time of old,
Dark, scary and very cold.
To be left alone to stand and stare,
Out of the shadows of despair,
To be left to feel so tired and stranded,
The doubt of a liar branded?

With no-one there to understand,
Who's with me to hold my hand?
Left to cry myself asleep,
I alone will secrets keep,
For I must learn how to cope,
From this dark place with little hope.

Heavy baggage forever to be carrying,
Will it prevent me from marrying?
Can I ever again feel whole?
At least this has to be my goal.
All I long for is a hug and a cuddle,
But that's what started this awful muddle.

I tell you one thing that's a definite must,
A dependable man to love and trust,
One that's patient and tolerant of baggage,
To sweep me off in a golden carriage,
To a new life, uninhibited and free,
But most of all to love me for me.

But that sort of thing only happens in books,
And besides, I know I don't have the looks,
Someone please strike a match or a light,
Just so I know an end is in sight,
I know I won't feel like this forever,
I would like to think I'm just that little bit clever.

But please will someone share my path?
To chat to drink and have a laugh,
To say everything will be all right,
To share my load and make it light,
Now it's time for this to end,
Guess what I need is a very close friend.

"event","Hmmm, what am i supposed to think??? 3 times now that i get flowers... I'm flattered, i love them, but why don't i feel as special as i should?? I don't know the purpose of the flowers... With today's roses, there was a card ""Thinking of you"". Wish they were from someone i care for and knows i care for them, but this is weird... Another lonely weekend... Staying home, don't feel right going anywhere with the home situation the way it is... Hope things get done and resolved soon... 

...dump away, i know u need to, i'm glad i can help or not so much help, but just be there... i know i need that now and again... :-)  thank u too, i know how u felt with the ""quiet""... it sucks... too much time to think..."

  Where I invite myself 
     To dine on ""implication,""
       To drink ""significance."" 

 Thus I fill my separate need 
  And I must confess...
     There could not be a better host 
        Nor a more intriguing guest."

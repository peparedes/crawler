My boy is very very close to moving in. This is moving too fast right? Fuck you. That's to everyone who said ""yes"". I look at it this way. Life's short, if you can find someone who makes you happy and you know its going to last only for a minute... why skip it? I'm not gonna. He could dump me in 6 months and I'd be happy I moved him in and played house.. fun while it lasted right. Right.

I so have nothing else to talk about in here anymore do i? didnt think so. Peace out."

And yes, that's usually the down fall with the guys I want to be with right? Not this time. Here's why, the old way I lived went like this...
1) find a boy
2) screw him
3) cling to something about him that was never there
4) get shot down
5) become slut for a few months
       RINSE AND REPEAT

I've done that 3 times now. for 3 years I've chased guys that werent interested in my in the least.  Last week I made a desicion to restart the cycle, but was held up by a guy who literally made me halt and evaluate what was going to happen. Now I have a this new found look on life and I know that no matter what happens with B. I'm gonna be ok, and I'm not starting that cycle over again. It's problematic. It forces me into a dark place that I wont go back to. Right now dark is just a concept I dont understand.

Work is hell. Other things could be so much better, but who cares. He's here. I know, this is a little too lovey dovey gross right, but oh well. HEAD OVER HEELS BABY! I'm talking ob-fucking-sessed right now. It's ok to admit it.. you're jealous.

Losing weight again. I'll prolly gain it back next week eh? I dont care anymore. Since my birthday just happened I'm old and unwanted anyways hahaha. 

Speaking of being unwanted, is it sad that Ashlee's new album is prolly the only thing I listen too? Yeah I thought so, damnit I hate annoying chicks with bad voices, they rule.

christopher lydon

clutching the phone till my hands were sore
i never understood pain before, christopher
you cannot know what it does to me
hearing you speak with this frequency 

i never knew what one voice could do
i was in heaven the moment i heard you
my friends go out drinking and having fun -
i stay in bed with my headphones on 

shot down with arrows from waves above
christopher lydon renounced my love

it took so long to get through to you
i never understood sorrow, and now i do
i finally got past your moniter,
and you broke my heart in two, chrisopher

christopher, i am your listener, christopher,
i've never felt love like this before, christopher,
christopher, now and forevermore, chrisopher
i'll never stop saying christopher, christopher

finally i knew what i had to do
christopher i had to make the connection with you
i dont care that you could be my father, dear chistopher
i will be yours til the bitter end........

so during a show about joan of arc
i got through - i said:
""christopher lydon, you've stolen my heart""
when i asked if you felt the same way for me
you cut me off like a guillotine

drawn like a bull to a matador-
i just see visions of chrisopher
shot down by arrows from waves above
christopher lydon renounced my love

christopher, i was your prisoner, christopher,
i hope you're happy now chistopher
thank you for everything but i'm not listening anymore nor do i plan to contribute to NPR
christopher what do you take me for i'm not just any old talk show host groupie....

Now the song of the day is the one I sang that one day I decided... I want more.

Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has ev'rything?
Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
(Sure) she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
(You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty)
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin'
Walkin' around on those
(Whad'ya call 'em?) oh - feet
Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strollin' along down a
(What's that word again?) street

Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free
Wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give
If I could live
Outta these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick o' swimmin'
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
(What's the word?) burn?

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world"

Well 21 isnt all that its cracked up to be, slower than 20 it seems. I dont think its all that great, my I.D. picture sucks.

We are young 
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield

We are strong, no on can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're beggin' me to go, you're makin' me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side

We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demads
Love is a battlefield

We are strong, no once can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefiled

We're losing control
Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield

We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long

I am nothing but honest, respectable, and kind to those people and they walk on me... its 'bout time I said something about that. Too bad its right before the vacation.. hopefully I'll have employees when I return.

So i got this present this morning. I loved it. Adored it. Adored who left it. However I will say this... it scared the SHIT outta me. I was having a panic attack all the way to work cuz of the initial shock. Even though I knew who left it.. i went outside and heard this like scream/howl... jumped in my van, saw something moving behind me, slammed the gas and got outta there. Seriously thought I was being set up.

I shall return, maybe tomorrow, maybe on my b-day to write that inevitable entry I dont want to.

I'm becoming less defined as days go by
Fading away
And well you might say
I'm losing focus
Kinda drifting into the abstract in terms of how I see myself

Sometimes I think I can see right through myself 
Sometimes I can see right through myself

Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world that is
Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(no it doesn't really matter anymore)
No it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes I am alone but then again I always was
As far back as I can tell
I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real to begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself


I just made you up to hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up to hurt myself

And it worked.
Yes it did!

Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a scab 
And I had this funny feeling like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone, I kept picking at the scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be, and I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why, now, now, now I know why

So the haunted house was fun, got a couple of people shitting their pants, well one actually. Good day today, hired someone, got ALOT of work done, gotta get prepared for the suits coming soon. It's gonna rock. I'm very work oriented right now, I complain alot but the bottom line is that I love my job to death and not many people can say that about much. It prolly disgusts people but the thing is that, this is my career, at least for now. I have a future here and its very fuckin' bright. 2 years, then I'm planning another promotion. 5 years, another one. By the time I'm 28 I will be making more than the majority of my graduating class that went to college. Maybe I'm jumping the gun, but if there is one thing I'm good at its jumping the gun.

Gah, new subject, thats all I talk about. So the Rivermen, thank god they are back on track cuz if I have to watch one more game like the last I'm gonna have to beat some boys up... and i have a friend with the tits to do it!

To prove I'm right

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Travel south crossland
Put out the fire
Don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older

And I did it again, sang kareoke.. yup, i swore never again, yet I did.. i apologize. And speaking of which, today's song of the day is the song I sang, b/c right now I DO. \

P.S. I hate Jesse lol

""Jessie is a friend, yeah, 
I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
Yeah 'n' he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl, 
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that

I play along with the charade, 
there doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, 
but the point is probably mute

'Cos she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

Like Jessie's girl, I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman, 
where can I find a woman like that
And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time, 
wondering what she don't see in me
I've been funny, I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love supposed to be

Tell me, where can I find a woman like that

You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl, 
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie's girl, 
where can I find a woman like that, 
like Jessie's girl, 
I wish that I had Jessie's girl, 
I want, I want Jessie's girl"""

"event","I know the consequence of putting something like a journal online, and perhaps I take this thing to seriously, but I do feel that it's unfair to become angry over something I put in this. I'm an extremely emotional person, not too mention bipolar. This is my outlet. When I feel something I write it down, I do this at home on a pad of paper, the only difference is with this I have to drive 20min to post anything. I've hurt the feelings of people I care for and that sucks, however, it was all over ONE thing I was feeling at ONE time. That's the point of my journal, I feel something, I write it down, its done, I move on. I dont write out of hate and to hurt people or because I'm genuinely mad, I write to let things out so they don't get bottled up.. i've done too much of that in the past. We ALL get annoyed with friends from time to time, its a fact of life and just because I'm honest enough to admit that for ONE hour I was annoyed doesnt mean I should be persecuted. Yes, I get annoyed with my friends, I do and I'm sorry for that... they cant say they dont get annoyed with me, they do... the point is that we are still friends, I'm not gonna let one thing on my mind change that and dont think they should do that to me. 

I didnt erase my entry, I made it private. I would never erase something I felt at a time in my life. I shouldnt have to do that but I'm being forced into believing that my private thoughts arent fair to have. I have to edit what I write in my journal... does anyone understand how wrong that sounds? Let's face it, I've had some ""interesting"" livejournal moments, but I've not once deleted an entry because I was sorry... that's just not me. 

I'm not writing any of this out of anger 'cuz there is no reason to be angry. Just getting out my thoughts on journals."

Went to Atlanta's bars, very scared I was gonna run into my boss, but I didnt :). The best.. Stanford bar, omg. Everyone was a customer of mine, and one grabbed my penis, I showed I dont know how many people. Oh jeez. I'm gonna have to see everyone of them tomorrow at work ! Really I enjoyed the night with Amber, Mandy, and Jesse. I hope all the bridges are rebuilt, understandable if they arent though.

Are you aware that both Ashlee and Fefe have new singles and both include the word boyfriend. SO, since I'm feeling pop-a-licious today I'll use both as my song of the moments...

Fefe Dobson - Bye Bye Boyfriend

""I've been lying, 
to keep you from this pain 
Now your crying, 
and to know that I'm to blame 
And I'll miss you 
But its over now 

I'm so sorry, 
that it had to be this way 
Please don't hate me, 
but there's nothing you can say 
To change my mind 
I've got to go away 

The guy that I fell for 
He wanted more and more 

It's time that I'd be on my way 
I used to like the way you said 
Baby back it up, 
Lay down what

It was fun but it couldn't last forever 
Bye Bye pretty boyfriend, 
It's time to, It's time to pack it up 
Baby 'cause its over now 

Let me tell you how it was when we started off 
The tattoos and the lip pierce and raggedy style you used to rock
Lately everything you do and say is messed up
Things have changed, down is up we're outta luck 

And Baby I'm sorry 
That it had to be this way 
Please don't hate me, but there's nothing you can say 
To Change my mind 

The guy that I fell for 
He wanted more and more 

You never put the effort in to the things that really counted 
A word here, and a kiss there 
Could change the way its turning out 
You work so hard at all the things I never cared about 
How hands work & fingers moving, Eyes wide Shut 
And baby I'm lonely 
Though your right in front of me 
You controlled me 
That was the girl I used to be 
Gave up myself
Well its over now 

It's time that I'd be on my way 
I used to like the way you said 
Baby back it up, 
Lay down what

It was fun but it couldn't last forever 
Bye Bye pretty boy, 
It's time to, It's time to pack it up 
Baby 'cause its over now ""

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>... how bout this hurricane? As a very important person (and yes I am) I feel it's my civil duty to report my thoughts on everything going on in the world right now. Hurricanes, they rule. I know people lost homes and shit but common.. who's idea was it to build a city below sea level? Or to build on over a swamp, which would make things sink... below sea level. This is a very simple theory and I'm just not sure why the fuckhead didnt see this coming. The thing about America is this, we're greedy pricks. When the tsunami hit, it was horrible, and of course we have to come to the rescue, now Katrina and prolly Rita are being compared to that... what? Right, well I guess a couple hundred/thousand American lives equal the same as 200,000 lives over seas. Gas prices... get the fuck over it already. No one is making much money off of it except in taxes but statistically speaking, we shoulda been paying these prices last year. It's actually the same price compared to what we were paying in the seventies as to what we were making. So ha. You need it, grow up, quit bitching and buy your gas.. and not like its the apocolypse.. if one more person tells me to stock up because its running low I will simply shoot them. Right between the eyes.. recognize fools. The president, hahahaha, 39% approval rating.. good job re-electing him assholes. Is it Hilary's turn yet? Not really, I'm not too sure I'd vote for her, she'd be a killer president, but she'd be labeled the first, it would be deemed a stunt, she deserves better.</P>

<P>I've paid my dues <BR>Time after time <BR>I've done my sentence<BR>But committed no crime <BR>And bad mistakes<BR>I've made a few<BR>I've had my share of sand kicked in my face <BR>But I've come through<BR><BR>We are the champions - my friends<BR>And we'll keep on fighting - till the end <BR>We are the champions <BR>We are the champions<BR>No time for losers<BR>'Cause we are the champions - of the world <BR><BR>I've taken my bows<BR>And my curtain calls <BR>You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it <BR>I thank you all <BR><BR>But it's been no bed of roses<BR>No pleasure cruise <BR>I consider it a challenge before the whole human race <BR>And I ain't gonna lose <BR><BR>We are the champions - my friends<BR>And we'll keep on fighting - till the end <BR>We are the champions -<BR>We are the champions<BR>No time for losers<BR>'Cause we are the champions - of the world </P>

So what's new? Staying at mom's for a few days while she's off to New York, so its just me, a big screen plasma, and her crazy animals for the weekend.. fun eh? I'll save on gas though, that's always nice. I'll have the internet which means my PIF and I can communicate with out waiting for a comment days later :).

And now, a classic love song for the feel of the day...

""If you ever
Change your mind
About leaving
Leaving me behind

Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You know I laughed
When you left
But now I only
I only hurt myself

Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I gave you jewelry
And money too
But that ain't all
That ain't all I do for you

Oh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You know I'll always
Be your slave
Until i'm buried

Well I'm working 21 days in a row right now, hopefully I can hire someone soon cuz this whole 12 hour days everyday of the week... getting old. I'll probably hire Mandi, that would be fun! But I dont wanna talk about work cuz it's so lame, its my life. I dont wanna talk about the boy or any boys for that matter cuz my head cant handle another migraine. 

I wanna talk about my PIF. Lately I worry she feels we left on bad terms. I dont feel so, at least not from my side. And if there were problems with me I hope she can forgive. I began painting the old bedroom, I'm gonna move in once they move out of there. I just miss her, I hope she comes to visit soon, we can watch Grey's Anatomy! MUAHAHAHAHA.

Can ya feel it? Can ya feel it tonight? Are you high love? Tell me are you fucking high??

Amber's b-day is Monday, got some great presents. Can't really wait for mine, yet I can. I wanna be able to hang out w/ my friends, but I dont wanna get older. Fucking crosses to bear right? Well.. that's all I would like to say as of now, I will leave you with my ""mood song"" for the day.

Imagine - John Lennon

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one"

I really had so much planned for this entry, but its all left me! OH NO IT'S A FAKE! I've been obsessively watching my Lost Season 1 dvd's... it's a little insane lol since i'd never seen the show really till i just up and bought it at 5am after getting into a fight at walmart. Wow, i lead a great life.
So from now on I'll be including the song that bests describes my mood at the moment or the day... here is the state of mind I'm in now...

Start Me Up - Rolling Stones

If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
I've been running hot
You got me ticking gonna blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop 

You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up 

If you start it up
Kick on the starter give it all you got, you got, you got
I can't compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slide it up, slide it up 

Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy
She's a mean, mean machine
Start it up 

If start me up
Give it all you got
You got to never, never, never stop
Never, never
Slide it up 

You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen
Start it up
Love the day when we will never stop, never stop
Never stop, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop, never stop 

You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man cum
You, you make a dead man cum"

<P>I just dont know what to say to start this. How about, ok, I give up. Well not completely. But if you want me to stop the pressure its done. It's been a very long sleepless 48 hours and I realized quite a bit. <STRONG>One</STRONG> - <EM>you aren't ready</EM>. I could've sworn you were looking for what I was. I was wrong. Even if you were, you weren't looking for it with me.&nbsp; <STRONG>Two</STRONG> - <EM>you didn't mean it</EM>. That night, you said.. and I quote ""It's not too late"" several times. It was. You knew that all along. This hurts the most. The things I did without the thing that shoulda been there... wouldn't have happened if I didn't think it was real. Which brings me to my next realization. <STRONG>Three</STRONG> - <EM>I really meant it</EM>. I don't like admitting to my feelings but damnit I have them. It took me doing something beyond deceptive to realize this. I got hurt and I did it by losing your trust. I apologize for that. I'm aware that I get a little nuts when it comes to guys. I set things up for disaster. I dont want you to be the next Kyle. I want to continue this friendship. So I leave everything right here. This is the last time I mention it should&nbsp; you not bring it up. Dont get me wrong... <STRONG>I'm still gonna hope</STRONG>. But I wont let that interfer with my life any longer.

"event","Well Sunday is here. Work day is here as my good friend Jason Wade of Lifehouse would say lol. As you can tell I'm in a much better mood. I got away for the weekend and jesus its like my uterus exploded. I had alot of breakdowns this weekend but I'm better for it in the end. Worked some stuff out with myself so now I can work it out with others. It's gonna be a good day and I'm gonna go home and spend it with good people. 

To paragraph one of last entry: Don't misread that, I love you, and I love B. If it meant you two leaving to change things, I'd ask that they stay the same."

"event","I'm at my mom's for the weekend so i figured I should use this chance to update. Not too mention that urge I have to let my thoughts explode all over this keyboard. So much going on right now. The roomate appears to be either pissed at me or avoiding me, i have no idea for sure. Could have something to do with my previous entry but I had no choice but to write it just as I have no choice but as to write this. My frustrations with home seem to have become too apparent considering they make fun of my anger anymore.. it's a game and apparently I'm the loser.  He's just very rude to me, very ungrateful. He makes you rude and ungrateful. I'm not a baby, dont give me a baby voice... I dont need to be rocked into calmness. 2/3... two fuckin' thirds of his life.. he's here. Probably more. He lives with us without the title of living with us. It's safe for him, he doesnt have to commit to anything particularly you, and rent. All I know is that I work very fuckin' hard so we have a place to live, I do that for him to, the least he could do is show me a little fucking respect for it. He needs to decide what he's doing. He needs to do it VERY quickly before he finds the locks on the door are suddenly different. I'm about to drown financially and he can't even pay $10 bucks a month to abuse my place. I shouldnt post this, its just going to upset people. I can't worry about that anymore though. I'm slipping back into old relaxation habits and I can't do that anymore. There's more to say but I have company coming over.. need to finish this.

Speaking of that company, that situation is just fucked. Here's how that one works.. let's BOTH confess everything we've been feeling and then you can ignore me and brag to my face about your latest conquest. Take it.. crush it... spit on it. Why not, I did it to you, why should you have class when I dont. It was my last chance. Thank you for destroying that. I mean I can do it alone, I always have. I just figured why, when we have something so great, why not share it with each other. I'm not gonna lie, I would kill for something more with you... Of course I'd kill for one of us to have the balls to just call or show up and say ""hey, snap outta it, let's do this."", but I just dont think that's gonna happen. You hate alot of things about me, i get that.. i dislike alot about you. I guess we're a little to immature to really discuss this so I'll leave it here. It's in your hands now though. I've made my feelings clear and if you want more from that just let me know but just dont lead me on.

And yeah, now some lyrics for my current mood...

Dresden Dolls - The Time has Come

the time has come

the time has come to speak of many things
of jacks and queens and kings

i bared my wrists and promised to begin
but you cut the blade straight in

the time has come: let's play find the missing song
there is something very wrong

try hard my love do you hear the distant strings
please remember what this means

did i come back for all of this?
it seems absurd somehow...
with one well-placed flick of the wrist
you've really done it now...

(all of my blind ambition left me deaf with perfect vision)

the time has come
for things to come undone
that we should not have begun

at last i felt a numbness overcome
and now you turn and run...

the time has come
to take me in your arms and touch these fragile scars

you have the choice now so decide
if you want in or out
there is too much left for us to try
you cant just give up now

the time has come
to speak of many things
of jacks and queens and kings

it took that cut to bring me back to life
theyre bleeding and theyre frightened still i hold out both my hands:
no one in the world will ever touch me there again.




... please dont assume that makes me suicidal, so help me god if one person asks if I'm ok... I'm gonna blow my brains out in front of them. lol. Suicide.. how lame."

"event","Very rough week for me. Up and down. Something needs to change before I snap out completely. And for once my complaints aren't about work. I just dont understand anyone anymore. The disrespect toward me has more than doubled to the point to where I don't feel human anymore. I'm just this drone that works his ass off and then comes home to be barraded with phone calls and finally fall asleep  and do it all over again. And sleep is no longer a relief, the dreams are so vivid and so true to what is going on. It depresses me cuz I know it's how things are, and how things will end. I'm so happy and yet so emotionally detached... yeah, I've got one hand in my pocket blah blah blah. The answer is No. I'm not. I won't be. You can't make me. The other answer is Completely. Of course. You can't stop me. They aren't the answers either of you wanted, but there they are. I apologize. Explosions are definetly coming. I cant drink around people because secrets are revealed and I look like an ass. But that's just it. I'm always gonna be the ass. I don't even care. I like the Killers new video, it's pretty, harder than shit to find somewhere to download it though. Colored cigarettes are so stupid, why does mom smoke them. Why does she smoke them around the baby who is allergic to them? I guess that explains so much as to who I am. I am her son. Ew. I'm so sick of whining. I really am. But damnit, if things could just be right I wouldn't have to. Fuck you livejournal, I love you."

I hope you get the help you so desperately need, filling the holes in your life with penis is no way to live. 

Just dont forget... I had him long before you and this didn't hurt me, not to mention like most guys.. he thinks your loose."

I'm enjoying this alot, not getting much sleep but never have so no big loss there. It's pretty lonely though, that's the only thing I didn't expect. I dont have time for my closest friends and everyone at work is now at war with me. In a sick way, I'm liking it that way though. I'm spending alot of time to myself getting to know myself. I had no idea I was so disconnected with my own personality and thoughts. 

Hmm, lame thoughts today. I'm bored. Maybe I'll go home. Maybe.."

But honestly I dont want to talk about that right now, I'd like to discuss people.  People in general are drawn to chaos, to supposed drama. Yet when the slightest bit happens near me, I'm an attention whore. Everyone, do me a really big favor and take a look in the mirror, could be the things you hate me for are what lie just below your skin."

However, as stupid as it sounds I really started believing in... love at first sight lol. In fact I believe it happened to me yesterday, but then again it happens to me all the time according to some people
 Yeah, I dont know, it was great though.

Work is making me insane. I have been doing excellent lately but this week is killing me. It sucks. Pretty certain my promotion is down the shitter. Oh well.

I just need to cry lol. Lame right? Well it's true. I can't do it at home, cant at work, so i've found myself just breaking down in my car driving places, not the best thing if ya ask me. It'll do. I'm all about settling."

"event","Wow, how to describe this weekend. Unbelievable? Yup, that sounds right. So Kiley and I leave late for the Bright Eyes show, thinking we're gonna be so far back, we get there and we are FIRST. I kid you not. So we sat against the wall thinking they wouldnt let us sit by the door... WRONG. A big group came up and squatted there. So we didnt get in first, still front row so fuck it. Ok and Conor.. he walked by us outside the theatre. It was so surreal. Like a few ppl freaked out and he just kinda looked away, but he smiled and looked at those of us who kept our cool! Gah, like just the thought of him actually seeing me even for a moment.. i was in his head lol. So that was all good. The Faint were amazing. I was so very impressed. We left the rail after them, Didnt really feel the need to be that close to hear Bright Eyes, I know that sounds shitty, but he doesnt even really respect his fans so I prefer to take him in from a distance, keeps it less personal. 

Tired. I'll write about father's wedding tomorrow. Later."

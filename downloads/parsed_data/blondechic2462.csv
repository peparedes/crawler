this was on someones away message:
Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, a guy who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep. wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, the boy who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without any makeup on. The one who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you..

thats you baby and i love you more than anything in the world.. you're honestly way too good to me.. im sorry for all the times i get upset with you over stupid things.. =(  i love you and thanks for putting up with all my shit.. i love youuuuuuuuuuu =*"

You'll fight with your best friend, you'll blame a new love for things an old one did, you'll always have that one guy from your past thats going to miss you forever...its ok to miss him too. And you'll eventually lose someone you love, so take too many pictures, laugh too much, make too many memories, and love like you have never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend being upset is a minute of happiness youll never get back..

"event","what a shitty way to spend a saturday night... i had a meet at 6 in princeton and had to be there for warm up at 5.. and before that i went to eat lunch with my parents so i left my house at 3.. then the meet started late and there was technical problems or whatnot so it took forever.. i finally got to swim at like 830 and i swam the 50 free and im so pissed off cuz i definitely think i couldve gotten a 27 cuz i was ahead by soo much the first lap but then i completely missed my turn because it was like one of those floating wall things and i couldnt see where it was.. and then the last lap i caught up a lot and did well for not pushing off the wall and i got a 29 which is amazing for missing my wall.. but im soo pissed off cuz that means i definitely couldve gotten a 27.. arghhhhhh sooo angry.. and then the relay got all messed up and we couldnt find every1 that was supposta be in our relay and then we got in the wrong lane and andrea screamedd at all of us but it was all just a big misunderstanding.. so then i swam horribly cuz i was all stressed out about it and our relay lost by a lot =( so i didnt get out of the meet till 9 and then my parents and i went out for dinner so i didnt get home until 1130.. suckss.. okay i have nothing else to say.."

"event","I wish we could
I wish we could
I wish we 
I wish we

You know it's so unfair
This life sometimes
When it never lets me fulfill
The deepest desire I have inside
If we could disappear
And fly away to a paradise
A place where only you and I 
To unleash this fantasy

Then I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
The way it has to be
Wish I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
Oh how I wish, I wish we could be free

I'm living through this heart of mine
But I would let you come inside
Cuz I was told it would be a crime
For us to share this love
But love is not a selfish thing
Why if I take it must I bleed?
Or is that how it's meant to be
If only we could live inside my dreams

Then I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
The way it has to be
Wish I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
Oh how I wish, I wish we could be free

Every night I wanna be with you
Doing all the things we wanna do
(Oh baby) A place for only you and me
To unleash fantasies
Oh how I wish I could be free with you
To do all the things I've dreamed to do baby
I would give you all the love you could need
Oh how I wish we could be free 

Then I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light (My love)
No one to say what's wrong or right (what's wrong or right)
The way it has to be
Wish I could love you every night (love you every night)
Hold you until the morning light (the morning light)
No one to say what's wrong or right (what's wrong or right)
Oh how I wish, I wish we could be free (The way it has to be)

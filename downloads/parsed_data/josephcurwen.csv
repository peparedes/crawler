"event","i am updating a journal!  so maybe they won't somehow delete it or use it to advertise real estate.  okay, updates in general, starting from the furthest in the past

read a ton of books
wrote one comic, and a half!
wrote some short comics
watched a lot of dvds (simpsons, family guy)
ate taco bell pretty much everyday
played mario golf
at various points spent time with my lady love sarah
drank
smoked
played games (of course)
downloaded a copy of radiant silvergun that i am obsessed with!  
oh, and i worked fabulous fireworks!  it wasn't as bad this year because i'm afraid that i am used to going to work everday by now.  crap.

i might start updating this more often, but i just said the other day that i hated journals and i'll probably get guff for this.  oh well."

"event","i can't face up to yin and yang and it's the first time in a long time.  proabably about a year.  I don't understand what fuels anyone unless they are the same things that fuel me.  I always have to look at things in terms of facts and figures.  I have to ask questions and get to the root of things but when feelings are invovled I have a hard time understanding.  

I can't help by remain objective.  

I can ijagine wars and feuds leading back generations.  

Everyone who has ever lived has gotten what they deserved and when i tell myself that I am almost sure of it.  

I hate it when my heart beats hard, it does it sometimes without any provoking and i can see my shirt move with the give and take but other times I know why and I hate it.  I wish tehre wasn't anything inside of me that let me know it was there.  

My mind isn't even seething now.  I bet this hardly sounds like me.  I gave up the simpsons for this.  I see love in the words of other men and it has never seemed so simple and 
peole are addicted to tv and I think it emulates life and then life imititates it because there is never a need for anything so base to be so complicated.  

an object at rest stays at rest

"event","i just finished connecting with a new book.  it is the book that inspired the song killing an arab by the cure.  i liked it a lot.  i finished it at work.  work has become the most taxing chore of all time.  I do nothing all day and i have to be on my feet and I can't read all that much.  I deal with it though.  It just means I have to start writing more.  I still have everyone, don't worry it probably includes you.  Somtimes I hate this city and I don't know anyone who has made really good friends here (my own opinion i assure you, there are plenty of people out there willing to fool themselves).  I hate the way peope look at each other and walk around.  They have no idea what they are.  I have been reading books about what the difference between humans and computers are.  

A list of required reading

Battle Angel Alita
Ghost in the Shell
Brave New World
The Stranger
The Rules of Attraction (don't call anyone a townie you fuck!)
Demonic Males
Lolita

Maybe these will help you, and I don't even think that most people realize they are that anymore.  

I have a will, I can stop and think, and I can question myself.  I thnk that's what makes us human.

and I'd laugh if you told me that most people were human.  

I love a robot once so hard and I feel for it and it looked and felt real like i could hold it we all saw how that worked out

i have a tattoonow tha has to represent everything that i think means anything and people lose sight.  People forget what epicurus said 

2 millenium ago

you figure people would learn more quickly

i smoke becaue i'm sure my grandfather did.  and it did him well.  I figure people have been smoking and drinking and snorting cocain for thousands of years and we haven't died out yet.  you can't fight eventuality.

"event","it consumes me and it's hard not to laugh at it.  what more could i ever want than to be filled with rage froever.  I am never more at pleasure gesticulating and screaming, in my own little world of fervor.  I am sick of bleeding hearts and wrought emotions.  I thikn it's what holds us back and we are returning to it.  Nobody knows what romance really is, and we swallow it like so many spoonfulls of sugar to make it go down.  

I do have it burning in me to hate all music when i have never seen anything worthwhile in my eyes.  it's a ballon ready too pop.  and for god's sake i don't want to be the needle i just want to be so far away when someone finally gets up the nerve to do it.  I can't stand to be nothing more than a screamer, and if i thought the world was ready for a new philosophy i would bring it to them but i know that things aren't near ready for anyone to take control yet.  Everyone is really content the way they are, even if they are unhappy it is a contentness as well.  Even if you hate Bush, you are content in knowing that you are fighting him right?  

This town holds nothing for me?  What has chicago ever had that i couldn't give myself, i came here for experience and got that, all inside my mind.  I am sick of all that is midwestern sometimes, like chicago, how bland and how it trys so hard to be something it isn't.  I have to be on the more, next summer is it.  If that doesn't work that i'm pretty srue the only option is to kill myself or others, unless i deide to go on some ""meds"" like the rest of the blind world ready to cut out the problems like an unwanted friend from a picture.  

I think that if our society had been building towards something I would be okay.  

Sometimes this thought croses my mind, but not often because I don't think that people even know any other way to be.  It's hard for me to be able to see the box but to have no way out of it, otehrwise I'll die.  

I also think that the only way out of the box is to die.
to break through that last thick wall of that damn box, and see what is beyond that.  

but all i can believe in is electricity and it's so violent and so am I and anyone who thinks they are gentle or should be, should die.  Everyone I see and consider close to me has that fire and wants to get rid of it and spit it in someone else's face.  well except one person...but that is but shadows and puppets.

more complacent morons.  i do believe things could work if the people who seemeed politically involved also cared about fashion...if they cared about anything.  i want to get out there and make a difference just to show people that it could be done.  i have always wanted to be a leader...people just can't stopo...they think they have done something, that they have done their best but it's enver enough they have to keep pushing themselves until their bloodi is a tidal wave that can stop anything.  

the government doesn't need to fool us, we have sex and television to distract us, books written by people just like us distract us.  don't blame it on big business, we participate as much as anyone else, as much as any ceo.  there is still too much quarreling among ourselves, too much talk of what did who to whom and all that jazz.  who wants any of that, people wouldn't do it if they didn't enjoy it on some bizarre level, like anal xsex.

my mind has just been working oddly today.

had to drop off my brother at University Park Train Station, which is near my old house, so I drove past.  It's all boarded up now, along with the camp that was a few hundred feet away where I would go to the thursday night fires there.  Sit there listening to Seven Spanish Angels.  Across the street is the Nature Center that used to be a church that I made christmas ornaments in.  It sits next to some nature trails that I walked with my parents.  Across the little strip of forest isanother house where my friend lived, the one who did something unjust to me.

Drove past that, but it made me think that I want to take someone that I care about out there, take them to camp pompei show them my house and history.  Walk the nature trails, go to the converted church and tell her that it's where i learned my grandpa died on the fourth of july years ago.

Next is the rode where i went to preschool, then a church, then the old ace hardware that i went to sometimes.  i don't pass my elementary school, but i know it's to my left and I finally make it to where it's very familiar by a power station where I have odd memories.

Now this whole time I have this sick feeling in my stomach.  the butterflies before i get on stage except it last for way to long for my desires.

Okay I did show it to one person, I got as good as I gave to her about her past.  I would like it if someone were excited.  

My writing is sort of on the back burner right now but i can't do anything about that.

Also, the third part of the maldonado triforce is back home, my sister is back but under bizarre circumstances that most don't deserve to know.  

Hanging out with a new crowd and there is not nearly the same level of comfort and peace as before.  I don't think it's going to get better, I liked how things went last time i made new friends.  Not so much now.

I learn new ways to use my muscles a lot now, able to use them in new ways.  It's really fun, it' s a metaphor for other things in my life.

okay, my writing is still around it's just taken diffeent forms.  bizarre drawings and hate filled phrases, things that remind me.  I'm putting my brain onto paper letting it leak out of my ears  so that way I can really look at it.  organize it lik so many etris blocks.  then maybe i can get something done.  I need a day where i feel powerful, able to ask the questions that I want to, say the things that need to be said.  

Monday has to be that day.  If I don't get a job I am selling everytying I own to get money to move, everything and everygame that isn't for nintendo.  how weird of a system is that.  

I am listening to this song on repeat because I don't have death cab for cutie anywhere to listen to.  

I still hate music in case you are wondering.  

My stomach has constantly been feeling empty although it's full and full of indigestion and bile and acid of other sorts.
watch out tonight folks, I'm full of hate and I'm going to spew it everywhere whenever i get the chance.  

I'd rather be hhiding around the corner fro you, running when you cannot see.  stepping lightly so that my footsteps cannot be heard.  roll out of the way when you turn and wonder what you see.  i'd rather be a ghost but only in a metaphorical sense not really dead.  who would want to be that.  I just don't want to be noticed by people.  they don't really understand me and if you don't see me then you won't have the urge to ask questions of me so i can save my breath and use it for better activities like smoking and taking deep breaths before i go underwater

i just wrote that at about 100 miles per hour.  my fingers blurred as i slammed wdown on the keys and i'm suprised that i spelled anything right but i remembered that i did quite well at typing in school.  maybe i should be a secretary or maybe i should use it to write.   i need a new damn ink ribbon I hate you brother ink ribbons!"

stupid fucking windows, why can't i have 98 2nd versiion, i'm all fuckin pissed off and i feel like puking all over myself

i feel the warmth run through me and maybe it's what i have been missing that thing that was gone from all my writing and I can't even figure out why things are the way they are.  I remember everything.  How you pushed me in the fist time

the people on the crosswalk who almost saw us

I miss it, i miss experiments and openness and i haven't had it in years, I'm starving.  

I'm tired of fightinng everything, people seem to think that i have to be around, if they don't like me let me reap what i sew for being a shitty  person.  fuck it  now it's time for some old memories

I need her so much, i want to break it, but I can't let myself. I have no idea what will happen. I am really scared. Don't leave me alone, if she hadn't told me not to leave then I don't know that I would be here, I'd be riding the train to wherever it would take me. I am going to get into bed, see if she wants me. There is nothing more sexy than a 20 year old sobbing like a goddamn kid with a skinned knee.


interesting huh?  when i spent the night with ginny a long time ago.  fun stuff, yippy yippy

a long time ago i hosted a show at my house that i wanted to post about, i was very happy with that

have had a couple of crazy relationships and made some new friends

still not understood as to why there is any sort of drama with other people because everything seems so insignificant in the big pictures

still miss everyone i have ever been with...you know who you are

visited by my past while working at fireworks, by jill, someone who brings about so many feelings that my brain freaked out and all i could think was ""guh"" for about 2 hours

bought way to many gameboy advance games, now i have to finish advance wars 2, golden sun, and Dragon Warrior III

oh plus, metroid prime

big plans in the future moving away have some money saved up to get going, all in good fun.  

girl girls girls are all i can think about, moreso than usual.  I love it though.  

Might go see terminator 3 tonight, alone, the best way to see a movie.

I love a lot of people right now.  

I also hate a couple.  

goodnight everyone.  sorry i haven't felt very creatively inclined lately, haven't had quite enough anger lately to write, just sorry, sadness, I miss what i have had before this."

1.  rape a girl

2.  become girls friend by explaining the need for the rape
    and this on top of the level of physical intimacy you've 
    experienced together will cause friendship.

3.  repeat

written last night:

He wasn't a bad man for a rapist.  Once megan came to know himi she competely understood why he had put his penis inside her when she didn't want it there.  It was for her own good.

After after finally he tired himsout with her petite asshole.  this is after her pussy.  After she passed out.  After she did.  He carved a new hole for himself in her side.  She didn't complain.

I had grabbed her by the shoulders.  I had slammed her into the wall.  If you, avid reader, can imagine how my fists left imprints in the wall behind her.  Why didn't she make me stop?  Did she enjoy it as much as I did?

Could I break your fingers to tell you a secret?

She didn't trust me at the beginning.  Not a word I said.  My hands weren't allowed near her.  A kiss on the hand, far too much.  yet, by the bye, my tongue could probe her every crevicicle.  She found it soothing.  

Looking out the window, can I feel what I wanted before.  Remember what the dew felt like or the bastard itchiness of the grasses.  you only enjoyed it once I was around.  Who have you turned on to it's pleasing lovely pleasures now?  When and were are my emotional sloppy seconds given.  

and now, and now for some poetry.  I hate almost all others.  

Maybe I did

How you could as well
is beyond me
found stuck in a trash can
after you left
my erection making 
it impossible for
me      to

get    out



I won't put up the other one.  I am far too embarrassed already.  

I didn't ask to fight you, he just came up to me in the arcade.  His ego made him spend all his money.  He couldn't stand to lose, just like me, but that's why I became good.  That's why I worked my ass off, because I knew I had to bust my ass so I wouldn't be a chump like him.  Why did I bother with this game anyway?  I was better than most, not better than some.  

I live in a lot.  

I drink mixed drinks.

I smoke light cigarettes

I have never been in a fight.  

Am I ignorant enough to remain happy, or teetering on the edge?

Am I half a man, or half a woman?

I know I'll take what I can get though, man or woman, love or hate fucking or making love."

"event","cruise control is the greatest thing in the world, for so many reasons.  

namely last night i was able to completely express myself while listening to my favorite song in the world without accidently crushing the gas petal to the floor

10-15, i have a hobby i can set goals for.  

you can't do it fast enough, yo ucan't cause enough fpain for me


why do i keep yo uaround?  if you can't fulfill my needs, if you can be my wife or children......

where is that picture?  where is the revenge picture?  

can i drive over the speed limit with you?  can i pass those semi's as fasyt as i can?  what about that truck,....how close can i get to it before you scream?

i had tokill you once i had you back again....it just wasn't the same....wasn't what I wanted

sorry for my spelling....i don't go back and hit the little key in the corner


i hate the cold, it makes my soreness that much more prominent.....

so full of life.  

i still can't cum......why am i only concerned with other people.  where are my social skills?  

where are the scars....the chafe marks?  

i'm sick of this body and I want out....it won't let me so i have to change it sto suit my needs.  i have to be able to ddo with it what I please but i need someone there to change jit for me. 

could it have been a subconscious day????  what would make me dpo that?  was it becvause of therapy?  because i talked about her so much that it filled my brain.  that i wore the clothes i hardly remember that were related to her?  


my fingernails are long now...i need to cut them but dont' hasve the will.  I don't want to hurt anyone though, I don't want to draw blood...not with my nails.

my god is dead, mr. rogers died to day.  

johnny cash did a voice on the simpsons and i just found out.  I'm ashamed of myself.

i would hate to think that someone was with me just because i was a good lover, or because i was nicer than anyone had been to them before.  

by that I mean, the other people treated them like shit.

i wuldn't dare say that i treated anyone all that well.  

my favorite position in the world is to sit and have my hands covering my face....to bad that it's not more socially acceptable.  that's whay i have to wear my glasses, because they give me the same feeling.  it's almost as good.  

i have never hated any oof you as much as I hate you right now.  you don't dare touch me....you don't dare try to mess with my alignment

we're fucking opposites!  nothing you can do is acceptable1   I'll destroy all of you if i could!  

it would be so easy

she could be taken so eeeassssssiiiiillllllyyyyyyyyyyyy

we're all sinners but you're so much worse than me.  

my flesshh.....sh...is covered with the dirt of sin....i can't cut it off...it won't scratch away.  

have i even given it a good go?  

mr rogers was from canada, yet another reason
canada 
rules

who will you hold tonight?  i mean all of you?  what is the point of holding your loved one or pillow or dog or cat?

I think my new theory is great. the theory that the person you are with tell syou when you are in love with them.  not the other way round.  what good is telling someone that you love them if they don't believe it?  so when it gets to the point where that they believe you are in love that's when they can say that you are.  brilliant huh?

so fuck your love!  i can't believe anyone when they talk about love!  I don't trust anything but the things in my head and that is only sometimes.   

my chest cracks when i lean back, i want something to pop out of my chest.  I want to be hurt again.  maybe that's why i care about her

cowgirl 
cowgirl

cowgirl


where's your lassoo?

where is your noose?

your helmet?  dont' you want to hide our face?  isnt that imporatnaatn that noone finds out who you are?  

i want you to hide your face, keep it away from me   I don't want it anympore   i ythreeww all of the pictures away a long time ago b ut you didnt"" know that did you?   i never wanted you to know.  please stay away...please burn yourself wiht a lighter
\
get addicted to it, keep a mirror in your purse so you can do it wherever you want.....destroy your nose

sleep with me tongith....

we'lll use your car as a bed  while you're asleep i'll starrt it and drive it into a tree.  It will be wrapped around it...the ttree will lgrow with pielces of you in it.  wyhen they chop it down your hair wil,l be in it somewhere.....burned somewhere for heat...

Fighters can only truly communicate through their fists

i need to do some comminicatin'!!!  yeehhhaawww!!!!

i'm still about fuck marriage, i'm still about fuck love

i'm still about peroxide

i'm still about taking risks with my life and not truly caring

i'm still about trying to fuck you over, and over and over again"

"event","but not to your level

i guess it would be a good policy to make a chick suck you off after you fuck them in the ass

i still do wonder how well you can fake it

i might have figured out why i smoke, part of it is the smells on my fingertips

cowgirl

cowgirl
cowgirl


you make me sick

did he make you suck it too?





so he has a really hairy ass?

you're deep in love, but deeper in the woods

and if you don't shut up, I'm not afraid to kill someone.  

tomorrow, at therapy, it will be an hour talking about you, an hour crying, an hour of hating myself.

which will hopefully be replaced by eating and merriment.

my stomach still does flips, my leg twitches, and if weren't so damn cold outside i'd go there and smoke.  

that anathema song will be mine.  

i lost my ring, fell off my tv and i don't care to ever look for it.  

damnit, letting loose air tanks, maximum depth.  

damn you, have you cum yet?  damn you for ever having let me know you.  

why can't I cum?  what's wrong with me now?  

I do enjoy my defects!  don't sit there reading this and think oh what a baby, complaining, this is all a list of things that I love!  these are my greatest achievements in fake pain and psychotic reactions.  the diary of someone who wishes they were crazy.  

my love for the stage has returned, i had to go up on stage at rocky horror and lose my virginity, in my underwear and aviators......people there told me i looked like Lou Reed.........

because of my amazing performance I was given the prize of free admission next week.  good chance I'll try and go.....not sure about the other show at the congress theatre on saturday.....damnit.  

i'll keep my mouth shut, but my body shudders with the memories.  i haven't talked to jez in a while, I hope she is doing okay.  maybe i'll give her a call.  I promise I won't bitch at you jez, this will be all that you hear of my problems.  i hope it doesn't bother you, I will remain tactful.  

don't tell me it's not my business!  of course it is!  I might go on medication again soon!  only temporary though, myabe it will stop these extremem reactions.......but that's why i have my glasses now, to try to hide my face.    

will she want to see me saturday?  alright, i am making my life into silent hill, that will be more fun.  

it's so sad that i identify with James Sunderland.......

but goddamn do I want to be pyramid head for halloween, I can't forget.  well unless there is something way fucking scarier in Silent Hill 3.  fuck that game.  

she actually watched sleepaway camp because i recommneded it

oh yeah

guess what the P stands for!   PENIS!!!!  

damn, have to check my recording, maybe more later"

I am gonig to get use of my father's machete', I""m going to enjoy all the fantasiez that I have ever had and let the law be damned.  who would stop me?  how fast would it end?  could i put the blunt end through someone's head?  i would be happy for someone else if they deserved it!  what's going on?  if anyone slightly does anything to set me over the edge they will get the brunt of it.....they will get the worst.  just be careful, I don't really want to hurt certain people i know so I hope it's not them......

"event","okay, so who is the psycho sympathizer?  just wondering!

i won't go into how great my valentine's day was because it's noone's goddamn business.  I had a bad couple of days there, except for valentines day.  I'm still sort of pissed off at a couple of people and there is usually only a couple things that keep me calm.  

Why should i help anyone out?  i believe in the golden rule right?  people give me shit, so that is what I'm going to give them, because no matter how many things I put into that relationship/friendship I don't get anything back.  nothing but grief, nothing but jealousy.  

I'm sick of that jealous throwing up feeling in my stomach.  I'm going to quit doing a lot of things, because I am trying to not care so much anymore.  I drank a little last night, doesn't bother me that I did, I still hate people who drink and I already hate myself so what is the point in doing the right thing for myself?  I have been smoking recently, I actually enjoy it, and I was really attempting to ""get high""  yesterday, but I was sort of uncomfortable with it.  maybe next time.....
maybe a friends only post is next."

by the way, anal sex doesn't feel any different than vaginal.  it's a different mental feeling for a guy, subjugating a woman, but it's okay as long as it's  a game.  As long as the girl isn't being tricked.  which i hear, is the most often case why."

And i know i'm not the only one. Like lauryn said. It's funny how money changes the situation. I guess it only counts if it's yours on the line. I saw alot in these last past couple weeks. And it's turning right back into speed of the sun type shit. although one good thing came to light from it, and maybe that was the whole reason. well whatever the reason is, there's gonna be some serious thought put into what needs to be done and how i can get it there..."

"event","how ghetto am i??? well it's a bit before two, i just got back from the show, and i'm eating macarroni and cheese. God damn, how much things have changed since speed of the sun ....yeah right. i feel like i'm right back there again. I should ruffly get about 4 hours of sleep till i gotta get up and goto goddamn work...ugh..and the hustle continues. On a lighter note, my show went well, not very many people there to see me and tony, but the ones that where there where rocking out lol. You should have seen the faces when i started off with my weezer juggle lol..it was priceless....And we got paid. Which is always nice. Honestly i did'nt care about getting paid, and i know that it came right out of kerem's pocket, since the door was so slow. so i got nothing but respect for that kid. Now to address something else. So i get home from the show and B wrote me a letter about why she did'nt go. I mean i know she loves me and i know that she worked all day, so it was'nt a big surprise when she said she was'nt going. It just kinda made me feel a bit bad, but i understood. I mean yeah i probably was a bit short with her, unintentionally, i was just running around with a chicken with my head cut off trying to get ready, and i really needed her then. But she's sick and i can't be mad at her for that. It's just that she's my bonny to my clyde, my cleopatra to my anthony, and i feel alone when she's not with me. I don't know what i'd do without that girl. oh well, like i said, i can't be mad at her, and i'm not mad at her. I want her to realize that....!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU B!!!!!!!!!...so once again in history news, CRAIG showed up again at another one of my shows. I mean i really can't stand that kid, but he really shows up to damn near every show i play on the southside. I can't knock him cause he likes the tunes i spin and my tabalism, it's just that he grates on my nerves whenever he talks...ugh...whatever fuck it, a fan is a fan..that's enough i guess...well i'm gonna finnish my mac and cheese, smoke a square and try to get some sleep before i gotta get up and goto work......"

Seriously i don't think that i ever have to worry about torture cause i'm pretty sure i endured the worst kind today. The doc just kept looking at me and calling me crazy for sitting there and taking it like a champ and not complaining. I mean shit, 12 fillings in one sitting!! the worst part is you could maybe see two of the cavities. all the rest where in between my teeth and not even noticable. hence why i did'nt realize i had them and put off going to the dentist for too damn long...here's a lesson kids, FLOSS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER lol. on the good side i got mad 7.5 ers for the pain...lol i love my dentist for hooking a brother up with the pain relief. But shit after that display of crazy fucking guts to sit there and have them all done i'm pretty sure that he would have perscribed me herion if he could have lol. I wish i could have got a picture of me with all that shit in my mouth, i felt like marilyn manson in that beautiful people video. retractors, bite plates, cotton, triangles, drills, water,and suction...jesus christ, i got a big ass mouth but shit that was a bit much. And it just figures that i'd see mad people i knew right after wards. I mean i probably saw 15 people i knew on the way home and each one of them wanted to stop and chat, mean while i'm drooling like a fucking vegatable in a coma. The novacain is almost all worn off by now but i still cant feel my right side of my lower lip, shit i should have gone and got my shit pierced while i was numb hahahahaha..oh well, at least i know that i could sit through any tat i want to get.

Snake

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Snakes have always been the seducers of human beings. If you know the story of ""The White Snake"", you will understand what I mean. In reality, Snake people are born charming and popular. Snakes are spotlight magnets, and they will not be ignored. Peer group attention and public recognition are the least of what he expects. Yet Snakes are never noisy or deliberately outspoken, and they have have excellent manners. 
Unlike the Snake who seduced Eve in to sin. the astrological Snake, is not a devil, not even a little demon. The Snake is a nice oversexed normal human being. Determined to follow through anything he undertakes to the bitter end, the Snake detests being left in the air. He makes his decisions quickly and firmly.
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Most people are secretly or hopelessly in love with Snakes. Gather those frustrated folk you know and most likely, they are probably in love with a Snake. Irresistible as they seem, the Snake never wastes time in idle gossip. He thinks often and deeply. He is an intellectual, a philosophers, a cerebral person. Snake people rely heavily on first impressions, on their own feelings, on their sympathies, rather than on facts, on the advice and opinions on others. He seems to have a kind of sixth sense in this way.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Snakes are a bit tight when it comes to lending money, though his sympathy for others often leads him to offer help. The fatal flaw in his character is, in fact, a tendency to exaggerate - in helping friends as with everything else. If he does somebody a favor, he becomes possessive towards them in an odd way. 
Another big flaw in a Snake's character is that, they are capable of biggie lies. White lies, true lies, whatever they call them, though they don't lie often, they do lie when they feel they can get away from it.
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In money matters, the Snake has good luck: he doesn't have to worry - he'll always be able to lay his hand on money when he needs it. Generally, Snakes are careful but generous with friends and family. The Snake should stick to careers that won't involve him in any risk - even the risk of working too hard, for to tell the truth, the Snake is a bit lazy. 
In love, the Snake male is romantic and charming. He has a sense of humor and the female is usually beautiful and successful. but if a Snake chooses a partner, he'll be jealous and possessive - even if he no longer loves her. Rejection is the worst blow his delicate ego can suffer. The Snake must be received, welcomed, accepted and approved by those with whom he comes in contact. They need a lot of security.

The Beatdown (the rematch)...What can i say, but that shit was off the fucking hook...i was kinda worried that we might not draw the same size crowd as we did last time...i could'nt have been anymore wrong...the crowd was big as fuck, we made the bar more money than they made in the last fucking month and went through 2+ weeks worth of beer, and then some.!!! We had a couple of dj's drop at the last min, which sucked, one was a bitch, one never got back in touch and the other had a family issue....But alas it would'nt have mattered if J would have come, i think i would have whooped up on him....those body tricks and my fucking juggling where sick...I know that tony was shocked as a mother fucker when i started to bust my first routine!!! the middle finger to him when we battled in the second round was fucking classic...i normally don't pay attention to anything but the records when i'm battling, but when i got through my first set of body tricks and shot tony the double guns, i clearly saw him just start busting out laughing and cheering and shit...I definately put to rest any question about my abilities that night...Not to mention that tony and I are definately putting 2x4 together soon...we allready have a show booked for april so i guess we better get on that shit with the quickness!!! hahahaha...our shit is gonna be so fucking tight it's gonna be disgusting....Over all the weekend was definately phatty as hell...i got mad props for hosting and putting the second sucessful battle togher, and running that shit much smoother this time...well except for the mc battle, but to be honest i was having so much fun with the dj part( which was the only solid thing we where doing when we started the beatdown series) that i did'nt really care about it that much this time...I was super happy with the dj's that came out and battled, everyone threw down and i'm really getting people hyped about this shit@!!! i always talked about starting a battle scene and *blad dow* i got off my ass and made it happen...And now it's time to just kick back for a min, and relax enjoy the sucess of another great beatdown and start working on my jamz to roller skate to remix album..hahah that shit's gonna be so damn tight...i mean how can you front on old school roller skating jams with some seriously ill break remixes!???? Last but not least, i'm so happy all of my crew and betsy are so much behind what i'm doing and they come out and support like fucking crazy!!!  Watching them get hype and have a good time just makes me that more happy and hyped to get up there and do my thing...hopefully schmitty will progress nicely and be able to rock the mpc or some tables with me and tony at some point....i mean he's gonna learn fast, shit scratching with me and tony's gonna be like turntablism boot camp for the boy ahahahahahahah...And Betsy is the shit...that girl puts up with so much scratching and me making noise, i'm surprised she has'nt killed me yet hahahaha...Being able to do this and with my peoples is what makes this shit so much more than just doing a club night or show...RESPECT"

So the show was really interesting for sure...Eric hooked me up with it, for another promoter who saw me at the warsaw and liked my shit.  He told me i'd be spinning in between bands sets and what not...and i'm always down for a show and it being christmas the extra money helps out.  But when i got to the venue i felt like i was gonna get fucking jumped hahahaha...nothing but wall to wall hardcore kids and metal fans??? and the only thing i had in my record case was hiphop and old school break beats!!! hahahahaha...but actually when i started my set the kids where eating that shit up...people where dancing and watching me do my thing and i was having a good ass time...not to mention that i'm gonna be doing a cd release party for one of the bands that where playing there last night. and i ended up scratching for two songs with another one of the bands. So all and all it was a good show.. i got paid, i got some free beers and i got more shows out of it...and most def some new fans. the funny shit is that some of the kids that where there recognized me from the battle and where asking if i was gonna be mc'ing and shit to hahahahaha....I guess my reputation is preceeding me now muhahahahaha....I'm just a multi tasking mother fucker when it comes to hiphop hahahahah, and that's just the way i like to keep it...real, down to earth, and positive as hell!!! the way hiphop should be...."

I put my first mc/dj battle together and shit went really well...aside from a mixer problem in the beginning, but that wasn'nt my fault...I was more or less the tech consultant, but now i got full control over the next one..And with this one, I'm going to control every aspect of how it's going to be run...From who the un biased judges are for the dj compition to how the mc battle will be run!!! No bullshit this time, and i swear if that fucking little raver bitch thinks he's any part of it this time, i'll cut his fucking fingers off...and actually he was'nt a part of it this time, aside from me serving his ass on the microphone like it was my job...but i'll get to that later..So for my first dj battle i was pleased with my overall set, talk about pressure...I was the first dj on the decks that night, and as i was getting ready to start i look up, and there where at least 10 video cameras on my ass...and you know what, it did'nt faze me one damn bit, when i got into my juggles and i heard the crowd getting crazy i was running on pure adreniline and was loving every minuet of that shit...but alas i got bumped by the kid who ened up going on to win the battle, which in my personal opinion, he should'nt have...i mean he had skills but tony blew his ass away...like i said new judges next time.  After the dj battle was over the mc battle was on... And once again i popped my cherry for the mc battle that night too..i've always rhymed, but it was usually on a stoop or with my boys just chilling.  It felt damn good to be able to grab a mic and go for broke on some sucka mc's and that's exactly what i did...NO ONE in that room ever heard me rhyme except for nate, and i shocked the shit out of everyone...I was vicious and extremely smooth on that microphone, i destroyed both of the kids i was battling, i made a mother fucker cry and quit, and the other one i punked out so bad he could'nt even finnish his fucking rhymes...I was happy as fuck with my performance on the microphone, i got props from every bboy in that room both black and white, not to mention i got props from every single person in the crowd that night...i mean regular bar patrons where walking up saying that i was dope and asking me when we where gonna do this shit again..!!!!!! I LOVE IT...so it's on again for fucking jan 18th...I put so much bullshit to rest about my skills it's not even funny, no body can front on my shit ever!!! they know that i'm dope on the tables and on the mic, and i'll be more than happy to serve any of them if they wanna talk some more bullshit!!!!!...hahahah you just can't fuck with an old school bboy from back in the day!!!!!!!!!!!"

I'm not sure words can even discribe how good it was...the vibe(ugh i hate that word) was fucking disgusting...Nothing but hiphop heads going fucking nutz and representing to the fullest.  A small venue with big names and it was off the fucking hook..I got to see a bunch of bad ass mc's(DEL, P.U.T.S., Planet Asia) who i've never had the chance to and it was fucking great!!! I never thought i'd say it, but this show was way better than the last J5 show i went to. I mean the crowd was going nutz for the entire four hours of the show and they just did'nt quit.  All of us that went where getting buck as hell and loving it. Every time i looked around i just saw schmitty, Luke, and Julie just glowing and feeling just as good as i was about seeing some real dope ass hiphop in a drama free enviornment. Not to mention we where damn near on the stage for the entire show!!!  I so needed that little road trip with my peoples..It was just so necessary to clear my head.  And every time i see a good ass show it just makes me that much more hype on putting my shit down like a mother fucker.  I just see how much fun they're having on stage and think how much fun i have when i perform and realize that i could live on that adrenelin forever and the sick ass feeling you get when you got the crowd in the palm of your hand!!! And i could tell by the look on schmitty's face that he was thinking the same thing...and that shit really made me smile, cause i think he's really starting to get what he should be doing..It took me a while to get where i'm at right now with my choice of what i want to do in life, and it was agonizing time in my life, but now that my choice is made i'm a much happier person..Yeah the whole money situation sux for me right now and i'm gonna try to rememdy that in the very near future (god damn upmc needs to get off their ass and let me know what the fuck is up).  I think that once rick gets a taste of what it's like to be on stage and wreck shit, he'll never be able to let that go..I sure as fuck know that i could'nt give that up..It's better than the most powerful drug and on ocassion it's better than sex! and that's no exageration. Shit i've done shows and stepped off stage and just sat down glowing and smoked a square and was just euphoric!!!  Without a doubt Music is the most important thing in my life aside from my girl, but to be honest i could'nt live without either of them and would'nt be where i am if one of the two where'nt there!!!  I'm stil grinning from ear to ear thinking about how dope that shit was and all the funky hiphop goodness that it produced! The only sad part of the night was having to drive to the middle of no where in ohio to have the illest hiphop show and then realizing that we had to come back to pittsburgh where the hiphop scene sux ass and it's nothing but bullshit bling rappers, and wack ass dj's..It just confounds me that a little hick town could be that live and i live in a metropolitan area and the version of ill hiphop here is fucking ja rule and other bullshit RAP!!!...Well soon enought that will change or me and the rest of my crew will move somewhere more conducive to illmatic hiphop and the truest form of what it means to be a bboy or bgirl!!!!!"

"event","So I got off my ass and did my ""patriotic"" duty and it feels good.  I now have every right to bitch about how much this fucking state sucks ass. And on that note, fuck these morons that drive like assholes around here, i went to get coffee this mourning and what do i see?, my fucking side mirror laying on the ground!!!!!! damn, it's like i can't catch a fucking break to save my fucking life.  But i digress, at least i'm hitting up oberlin tomorrow to see fucking DEL THE FUNKY HOMOSAPIEN, and P.U.T.S!!! Finally some good ass hiphop, and i only have to drive three hours to see it hahahah...fucking pittsburgh, maybe someday this city will actually jump into the 21st century and realize that diversity and cultural events consist of more than football on sundays and hockey on mondays....aight, enough bitching I've got a large coffee sitting here and Stern's on the radio.."

"event","How the fuck do i fuck up my pinky scratching records?????  Please tell me cause i have no fucking idea of how i did it, but it's fucked up for sure!!!! It must have been two or three nights ago when i was practicing juggling for the battle and i noticed my pinky really starting to hurt for some unknown reason, so i gave it a rest for a min and went back to practicing and never gave it another thought. Then i wake up the next mourning and i can't even bend the motherfucker and it's black and blue and swollen....ahhhhh i must have torn a ligament or i have a stress fracture or some shit, but it's definetly not right..I'm not gonna waste my time going to the doctor cause i know that he'll just tell me to imobilize it and take advil, and there's no way i'm paying out of fucking pocket cost just for some asshole in a lab coat to tell me what i allready know.  Not to mention some smart ass comment about fucking my finger up just juggling records...blah...i hate pretencious assholes like that!!!!  But i digress, i'm still practicing and i know that it'll probably be fucked up until after the battle and i give it time to heal and what not..I just can't afford to take time off now when i gotta practice and put together at least 3 different battle sets....I'm not really worried about the battle, cause the only dj that's gonna give me compition is tony and that motherfucker is just sick so whatever...And on the upside i'm gonna get to wax all these motherfuckers talking shit about being tabalists when they're not even close hahahaha, these kids around here are a fucking joke, and it's gonna be fun to go in there with tony and just clean house!!!! I must be a glutton for pain because after this journal entry i'm jumping right back on my decks for some more torture!! i guess that old saying that nothing good comes easy is true as fuck, but dedication is a bitch, and i'm not stopping till i'm standing at the top of the pile looking down!!!!!!"

"event","I need a fucking mpc like a motherfucker....I hate programming beats on my 303, it's such a pain in the ass.  I need something with easy editing functions and on the fly changes, the 303 just gets on my nerves having to go back and edit every little fucking thing and using like three different buttons just to get to the edit function.  Not to mention i can't import anything as far as samples and shit...ugh i can't wait till i get some loot and can just go nutz buying new equiptment and what not. The shopping list is growing everyday. New 1200's, mpc-03, new comp with pentium four with pro tools.  That's all i'll really need to be able to start pressing my own shit. I just need to find a place where i'm not gonna have to press like 500 copies to get a real plate cut.  But i suppose i can worry about that when i need to.  It's sick how many differnt beats i allready have worked out not to mention basslines for them. I figure with in the next six months i'll have enough for at least 3 break beat/battle records.  I would'nt mind working on some dub again like the old days..I miss playing with a full band, although i don't miss the bullshit drama of working with 4 other people. or riding in a shitty conversion van for weeks on end touring.  It's so much easier now only having to worry about myself and at the very most me and tony. Damn once i get shit situated and what not i'm out of pittsburgh no fucking doubt..this city is like a giant nursing home for white trash.  I need somewhere where i can goto the beach everyday and look at the ocean. This city sucks the creativity out of you like a starving vampire.  I never really noticed how much i hated this city until i came back from south carolina. My mind works much better in warm weather and some palm trees to look at.  Now i just need to convince B to move down south with me hahaha....I'll just have to get her lots of sun block..haha...Oh well hopefully it'll be soon enough...i have the right people around me now as far as music and production, i just gotta convince them to go with me hahaha...that should'nt be to hard. hahahah...My prediction: in a year and a half i will be looking at the ocean playing my guitar to a little dub beat that i produced sipping on a nice little drink...."

"event","This weekend was off the fucking hook...I have'nt had that much fun at a costume party since i was probably in grade school...hahaha...everyone looked so pimp, and put mad time into looking good and shit...no half ass attempts by anyone of the crew there...and of course yours truely looked dope as hell, lesiur suit gold chains and a big ass fro....And B looked damn good with her cute little elf ears and what not....We got there a little early and chilled with tony, d nice, ryan,nate, and amy....helped set up and get shit ready.  Did a couple of shots and then got loose on the tables for a min. After a few more shots and a couple of beers i jumped up on the tables to start wrecking shop, and that's exactly what i did hahahah...the classics where in full effect and every one was grooving like a mother fucker...I just kept throwing down records and downing beers in between about every third record. I was having so much fun just keeping everyone dancing that i did'nt even notice that i was on for a good two hours.  Finally ryan stepped up with his crate and started getting down with the dnb style, that was just fine for me cause about that time i was a. about to run out of records, or b. piss my self..hahahaha...After i got off the decks i got mad props from the kids dancing to my shit and even the kids just getting drunk and what not...I can't tell you how many times i heard holy shit i have'nt heard that shit in fucking forever...hahahah i love making the crowd move and keeping shit live for real. After i got my shit back together i grabbed a couple more beers for the walk around the party and did about 6 more jello shots just for good measure. and talked to some heads and chilled to some of ryan and erics dnb. Which i found kinda odd cause i usually can't stand that shit, but they where keeping that shit funky and breaky as hell.  After i chilled for a min i ventured up onto the roof to see what was cracking up there and i talked to nate and tony for a couple of mins until this drunk ass hoochie bitch stumbles up the stairs, spills her drink on my shoes and looks at me and says ""jesus, how skinny can you be"".  Nate, Tony and Betsy all just kinda recoil in horror cause they think i'm about to unload on this bitch and roast her until she's crying and ends up in therapy for the next ten years....hahahaha...it's great to be feared hahaha...but i was nice and buzzed and i let it go, i just looked at her and said hun, you're lucky i'm in a good mood, consider this your get out of jail free card..after the drunk girl leaves, everyone just kinda looked at me and said ""oh shit man i figured you where gonna destroy that bitch"" hahahaha...so after the mini drama ends Nate tells me that he wants to go downstairs get tony on the tables and start ripping the mic for a min...It had been a while since i've graced the mic and i was more than down for it.  Me, Tony, and nate venture downstairs, wade through the crowd and proceed to take over the tables and hook up the mic.  I figured that mc's would'nt draw a crowd but i could'nt have been more wrong, cats came out of the wood work and just crowded around the tables and myself and nate..Nate ripped the first verse on a beat tony was cutting and passed the mic off to me, i grabbed that shit and started to bust, there was about half a second of silence and cats started going nutz, i guess they where'nt expecting a little white boy to rip shit like i did...I heard a couple of the black girls behind me be like ""oh shit white boy was'nt bullshitting about wrecking the mic"" that made me smile like a mother fucker!!!! Me and Nate passed that shit back and forth for a good half hour to forty five mins...we had the crowd on lock down and heads where feeling it for real...We both got crazy respect from everyone in the place, talk about an ego boost for me, i have'nt busted in public for probably two years at least, and i wrecked that shit..I think i surprised everyone in my little crew and i know that i surprised B cause she's never really heard me freestyle. B told me that D nice and ryan ran over and where like holy shit how long has he been practicing for this shit...she was like practicing, shit he was'nt practicing at all, he just stepped up and killed that shit!! B told me that everyone she talked to was really impressed, and i got a couple of offers to guest mc and Tony was talking about putting a little hiphop project together. So needless to say i put shit down and was really happy about wrecking shit on both ends...after a combined 2:45 mins of performance time and countless beers and shots, i was nice and buzzed and really beat...I sat down smoked a few sqaures talked to tony and nate about seriously putting some shit together and gathered my records and mic...after i got all my shit together, i said my goodbyes and found B...Right as we where about to leave, nate comes running over and was like yo kid, i'm gonna holla tomorrow and give you my schedule and when ever we get some free time you gotta come over and start busting shit with me.  I told him i was down no doubt, told that bitch ass tony to give me a hollar about scratching some records in the near future and stumbled out the door with my lovely lady guiding the way....We made it home safe and sound, with big smiles on our face both talking about how much fun we had....so all in all shit was off the hook and me and my little crew most def kept that shit live and direct!!!!"

"event","Today is starting out much better than i thought it would....I took betsy to work and ran to my bank to cash a check from nora, and decided i needed to go to jerry's.....my spidey sense was tingling and i knew there was a reason i needed to go..aside from my addiction to vinyl in general and the fact that i have'nt been there in a while....so after about 30 mins of digging and about 3 pounds of fucking dust in my lungs i was about to call it a day, due to the poor selection of what i was looking for(records for the battle), when something caught my eye....i bent down and dug a little further and low and behold what do i find?  The fucking Fresh prince track that i've been looking for,forever...and yeah yeah will smith is booty, but i'm only gonna use one break and half a verse....and really you can't fuck with a bad ass old school beat and a verse that starts out ""this is a story that should not be forgot, about the day my dj turned into an auto bot, he got struck by lightening in an electrical storm,he got molded with steal, and began to transform!!!!!"" hahaha hot shit...i'm gonna transform cut the shit out of that goddamn line!!!!hahah i love it...i'm soooo geeked i've been looking for this record for probably like two years, and shit 3 bux for a 12 inch that's been out of print probably since 89 is the dopeness....."

"event","aight... so this will be the first of many entries into my online journal.  First off thanks to schmitty for hooking this little journal thang up for me and what not. There's really not that much going on today, just the same old shit..sending out resumes and playing the waiting game. Who ever started that old myth that all you needed was a college degree for a good job is obviously full of shit..I spent mad loot, time and effort only to come out of college to find out that i just should have saved my money and opened a studio right out of highschool...I'm glad that i have an education and i know i'm a better person for it, but damn i have a degree and there's motherfuckers working at a fast food joints making what i made at my last job...aint that some shit..Mental health workers are seriously underpaid, underappriciated, and over worked..this to me seems to be a injustice considering we're doing what everyone else does'nt want to deal with or even be bothered with...there's something seriously wrong when the people that do the best work for society, get the least amount of pay and the least amount of respect.  I never expected to get rich off of doing social work, but damn what most companies try to pay won't even cover bills let alone give you enough money to eat on....Not to mention the serious risk to your person when you're doing your job...but i digress, at least i know that going back for my masters in social work is completely out of the question...this time i know what i want to do and that's my first love...MUSIC...i don't need to be famous, i don't need to be rich, just to work with music everyday and make enough money to pay all my bills....It feels good to know that i'm on my way though, i've been busting my ass and things are starting to pay off (ie bookings and respect from those who appriciate what i do).  Not to mention i got the right crew around me now who are down for doing this music thing too....they're motivated and ready to make moves, the time is right and things are falling into place..soon enough i'm not gonna have to worry about this day job bullshit...I'll end it on this, a quote from my old band ""been knowing from the start i can't work no 9 to 5, i'd rather sit around play guitar, and get high, cause with every step i take, makes me wanna say, bring it all my way....."""

so when I finally move somewhere with t-movile or cingular I can get one. Until I reason myself into getting a crapier phone and then a week later realize that i made a mistake. i'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

I've discovered a website called dailymotion.com. yesterday I wathed hours and hours of southpark and the newest season of the American office. i literally sat on my couch all freakin day. but I'm up to speed with their crazy antics.
right now in Bozeman it is -15 degrees. last night I parked in front of my building because I would have had to park three blocks away and walk back in the arctic weather. I figured that if those bastards wanted that goddamned ticket that bad they would have to work for it. apparently they wanted it that bad. There is an inch layer of ice I had to scrape through on my window but I did and I can see that little pink slip waving at me from my windshield. 
well I'm going to go to the gym."

I only remember one thing. and if you've read the book you know exactly what i'm talking about. it's one of those life altering what the hell just happend kind of things that i think fucked me up a little bit. it's like in watership down. i read that damn 600 page monstrosity only to have all the goddamned rabbits die. sorry to ruin it. 
i also saw the new harry potter trailer. i had to go back and read the last book because I didn't really digest most of it because I knew someone died and i wanted to find out who. if you haven't read it it's Ron. He gets attacked by bees when he goes back to get his mood ring in the forest."

"event","My friends were returning from a shoot in Portland driving through missoula when their car rolled three times sending two of them to the hospital and killing one. Andrew was only 21 and one of the most promisingly talented cinematographers I'd ever met. He also had the enviable quality of raising one eyebrow a good two inches. In film school there are plenty of kids that you would say, yeah I like Jim but he's kind of annoying... but andrew was a great guy, he was one of those genuinely nice people that are  so fucking rare anymore. 
It still feels like they're on their way back and they're just taking a long time to get here. Andrew was supposed to be on the set I'm working on this weekend. This isn't supposed to happen. He didn't even graduate. 
when Justin killed himself a few years ago I could be angy at him, when my uncle died of cancer last summer we had known it was going to happen, but this is crap. There wasn't alcohol involved, it was just one of those things that leaves you going ""What the fuck?"" 
I wish it made sense. but i don't think it ever will."

I don't even know who spoke at ours, there was a lighting mishap and a large crashing booming sound during our senior song which caused me to crack up and not finish the song, which was okay, i don't remember what the song was.
I remember that Sean didn't want to go, he being the typical 8th grader claiming he could watch it on TV, but I threw a huge fit and made him go, so Eileen shall be attending this years Senior High Graduation. That's how I roll."

Dear Eileen,
Congratulations! You've managed to once again leave Billings and are in great spirits. Possibly the most confident you've ever been in your entire life, and financially secure for once. You like yourself, you work out on a regular basis, and you are extremely secure in your single status.
Please bend over.
Life has something to give you. 
Please direct your attention to the exits located to the front and side of your future decisions, though they are clearly marked you will completely ignore them. 
But hey, at least you're not on crack.
Good luck and may god have mercy on your soul.

"event","Dear Last Thursday,

While you are an oft overlooked day of the week I've always held a sort of fondness for you. Stood up for you when others would complain of your day-of-the-week-ness was lacking for them, I was always there saying,  Hey, it's better than Monday. But apparently that wasn't enough. Thursday you had to go and completely drain me for the rest of my weekend. 

Thursday, you are having a time out. For at least another five days. You sit and think about what you did.

Eileen

Hurry the fuck up Brian and Andy.

ps. All parties involved with Thursday sucking can go to hell too."

"event","An open letter to the spider currently inhabiting the upper corner of my bedroom:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am pleased to see that out of all the rooms in this home you could have chosen to inhabit that you indeed chose mine. I quite like it, though it is a bit cold right now and I have the leisure of putting on a sweatshirt and you do not, but you appear to be quite comfortable sandwiched between two walls and the ceiling. I would request that you avoid any sort of contact with my Guiness poster as I quite like it and any sort of motion from you right now would be met with a sharp swat with the Glamour magazine I have laying by my side. 
I do respect that you are quite a large spider and it is the middle of January. You most likely have become this by eating smaller spiders and then wearing their skin for warmth. I can only venture to guess what sort of spider you are but I would not want to insult you by suggesting smaller weaker spiders, so we will just not worry about that.
While your company has been greatly appreciated I do regret to say that I will have to smoosh you before I go to sleep because I don't feel I can trust you with the lights out. 
Yours sincerely,
Eileen"

"event","So, those of us who live in Billings are aware of the fun that is the Rabbit Lady. 
She has a giant lop-eared bunny that she dresses like an infant and ports around town in a baby carriage. It frequents plays, the circus, the museum like any normal child would. She was somewhat of a legend when I was a kid but she does exist and attends my friend Ashley's church. Now one may ask how a rabbit can manage to live so long. Well it doesn't, apparently Rocky, which is it's name by the by, has died many times and is just reincarnated through the purchase of a new rabbit. In case you were wondering the current rabbit is number five or Rocky V if you will. Anyway, Ashley's mom works at the church and oftentimes vollunteers Ashley to help parsishoners with moving, house painting etc. Well this weekend Ashley had the pleasure of moving boxes for the rabbit lady. I have no idea what her name is but I do know what number rabbit she's on.
Anyway, so Ashley drags her boyfriend along with her and the fun begins right away. As she pulls up the lady is digging around in her car, she apologized saying that she had to get her kids car seat. Yes, the rabbit is her ""kid"". She dropped a toy sail boat and Ashley was helpful and picked it up for her, ""Oh,"" said the Rabbit Lady, ""That's not mine, it's my kids."" Just to clear up any confusions apparently. As they entered the house Ashley observed the vast amount of dolphin paraphernalia (sp?) and the lady said, ""oh, that's my  kids too, he loves dolphins, whenever we're out and he sees something dolphin he has to have it. Isn't that right Rocky?"" She looked at the elaborate house she erected for the rabbit in the living room and nodded as the rabbit replied to her. ""Oh I will. This is his Christmas present,"" she said proudly displaying a dolphin shaped nightlight. Apparently the rabbit also attends prayer readings at the church and must always have it's own pamphlets to refer to. When they are going over the pamphlets his mother will lean over and whisper helpful things like, ""No we're on the yellow one, page five. That's right."" Sometimes she'll raise her hand and say, ""Oh rocky has a point,"" she'll stop, listen and nod, ""uh huh, uh huh, well Rocky thinks...."" 
Though the rabbit has it's own house with heated floors that sits in the living room. At the time he was in his carrier watching TV. ""He just loves to watch TV."" Ashley's boyfriend Trevor was curious so he peeked in the carrier. ""Hey, where's the Rabbit?"" The lady flipped out and started running all over the house searching. Apparently it had been potty time for the rabbit and he was safely in the bathroom at the back of the house and was quickly rescued.
""So the strange part is,"" Ashley said to me. 
""The strange part?"" I ask.
""Ya, the strange part, is that she was talking to the rabbit and it was responding that entire time we were in the living room. But it was in the bathroom the entire damn time.""
So there you are, happy new year."

"event","I first became really into the Beatles when the anthology came out in 96'. Much to my sister and my surprise my dad was actually cool enough to own a bunch of Beatles vinyl that he was kind (or stupid) enough to let us play on his ancient turntable. All the good ones were there, Abbey Road, Sergeant Pepper (which my mom also had, and may be the only album my parents had in common) etc which we played to death everyday after school. The only problem was the white album which only had the first disk in it. We sat frustrated playing the first over and over again finally approaching our father with an impatient, ""What gives?"" Well it seems in the early seventies my father borrowed my uncle's rather nice speakers and in return had to hand over the second album.  so you basically don't know where it is? we asked. ""Oh no,"" replied dad  ""your uncle still has it."" We rolled our eyes in frustration suspecting that a two decade long spurt of laziness was keeping us from the album, ""so get it back.""
""What? And give him back the speakers?""

When my grandmother died we found the missing White Album Ringo headshot in one of her drawers, no one could really figure out what it was doing there until it dawned on someone that she probably thought it had been appicture of my dad and had held onto it all these years. Or she had a thing for the goofy beatle."

"event","I'm PA-ing one of my good friends senior films. A PA is just a nice way of saying ""Producers Minion Bitch) but it's always nice to get some experience so I was happy to help. The first day was a shoot in Billings in the alley behind the Brew Pub. For everyone who was not in Billings on Sunday the weather was miserable cold and rainy in the morning but warmed up as the day went on. This may sound nice but keep in mind that we were soggy, cold, crabby, and within feet of an equally soggy restaurant dumpster that was beginning to warm in the sun. At the end of the day I was pretty much dead to the world and hit the hay around 8 pm, I was just drifting off when I got a call from James the producer.""
""Hey Eileen, before we go shoot tommorow could you stop by Thompson rental and pick us up some top hats?""
Excited to redeem myself for my earlier crabbiness and excited to have a pivotal role in the costumes of the following day I happily agreed.
The following day I got up early, ready to perform my intricate PA task and cruised on over to Thompson rental to get my top hats. It turns out there is quite a selection of top hats, ranging in color, to size and fanciness. I chose a medium height black top hat of lesser fanciness because we were shooting in the rain that day. So I purchased my top hats and returned to my car. Suddenly the director called, ""Eileen, we need some badges to."" So I said okay turned around and went back inside. There was also quite a decision on police badges there so I called the director back just to make sure I was doing the right thing. It never occurred to question why he would need some top hats and police badges in a field in Belgrade, I just purchased my badges hopped in my car, got my top hats got my police badges and cruised 20 miles out of town to a remote field, the directions to it included a left at the dead skunk, making pretty good time as far as shooting went. I pulled up and hurried over to the director happily presenting my police badges and top hats. He took the bag looked inside, shook his head and quietly said, ""cop hats Eileen.""
 
Th The production team spent the rest of the day trying to think of fun ways to add the top hats into the movie. The moral of the story is never have me PA a film. Or enunciate if I do."

1. Grabbing the ciggerette out of a girls mouth, shouting rubble rubble and running away.
2. Leaning closely to a fellow computer labber sniffing and murmuring, ""hmmm. orange juice.""
3. Throwing an overpriced day planner onto the floor of the book store and yelling ""who do you think you are?!""
4. fiercely kicking a booth set up in the middle of campus and just pointing aggressively at the person who sat there.
5. Politely refusing the mini scripture offered to me by the gentleman in the nice suit saying, no I have many bibles, all much larger than yours."

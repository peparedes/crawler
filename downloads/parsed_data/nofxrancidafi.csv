"event","I've nothing mean, nasty, or rotten to say about Rick. Well, I do, but I'm not GOING to. All I want to say is why would anyone go out of their way to hurt someone for no reason unless they were insecure about themselves? Not only that, but why spread rumors about something that never happened? The only thing I can think of to say to my friends(?) back home who don't know what to believe is: Are you really going to put all your faith into someone sying they don't have control issues who punched a hole in the wall because I wasn't home when he got back from work? Now, THERE'S intelligence for ya. Break part of your house because you can't pin someone down and control them. ""oh no, where's nicole? she might be having.....FUN!"" *SMASH!* Just think about it, folks..."

"event","Yesterday, I decided I was going to drive everywhere, and that Rick was just going to have to sit in the passenger's seat and look pretty. He told he how to get to this one pond where all the ducks, geese, and seagulls hang out. So, on the way there, I decided to buy some bread....for the birds. We got there, we fed them, we ran out of bread and decided to leave. As I turned away from the water's edge, and faced the grass above me, I saw this little figure almost hidden in the rocks at my feet. It was a Canadian Goose, and it was lying perfectly still. The minute I saw it, I knew it was dead, but I didn't expect that, when I touched it, it would still be soft and warm. I fell in love with this bird immediately. The neck was still intact and not broken, there were no injuries, and there was no apparant reason for death. So, I laid the goose on the brick wall by the rocks, and looked at it. The feathers, the wings, the feet, the body, the stomach, the back, the head, the neck, the eyes, which were still half-open, the tail...everything about this bird, I looked at, and pet softly. Then, I picked up the lifeless shell, and carried it to a trash can where I found a grocery bag. I put the bird into it. I found another and put it over the top. Then, I carried the bundle under my arm to the car, where I strapped it into the back seat with the seatbelt. After this, I drove it up to Joe's house. ( http://www.livejournal.com/users/tetra ) I told him: ""I brought something for you...you're going to love it...do you have a towel i can lay this on?"" He put down a towel for it on the bed and I took it out of the bag. We all three looked at it extensively, but only I was in such love with the carcass to pet it and love the way I did. I cut off three feathers. One for me, one for Rick, and one...for Joe. I had hoped he would have appreciated the whole matter in exactly the same way that I did, but he didn't seem to. I don't really understand why, but it doesn't matter. Even if no one ever sees it the way I did, atleast I did. After a while, we decided that the smell was starting to take affect, and before rigamortis set in, that I should take it back to the pond, which is what I did. It was so beautiful, I almost want to go back out there today just to see what it looks like after a day of decay."

"event","The Idealist Portrait 
All Idealists (NFs) share the following core characteristics:

Idealists are enthusiastic, they trust their intuition, yearn for romance, seek their true self, prize meaningful relationships, and dream of attaining wisdom. 
Idealists pride themselves on being loving, kindhearted, and authentic. 
Idealists tend to be giving, trusting, spiritual, and they are focused on personal journeys and human potentials. Idealists make intense mates, nurturing parents, and inspirational leaders. Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self--always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials. Idealists are rare, making up no more than 8 to 10 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers. 

The four types of Idealists are:
Healers (INFP) | Counselors (INFJ) | Champions (ENFP) | Teachers (ENFJ)"

"event","Well, I figured enough time had passed that I could call Aaron again. And Brian had assured me I could. So I did. I tried to explain everything. For the first half of the conversation, everything was fine. He seemed to understand.....and then he put on that fucking song and i KNEW he was going to do it. He totally fucking made me feel guilty for what I have done by moving out here. And he even managed to work in an unfounded accusation while he was at it. I have more respect for him than that. Anyway, the point is, at the begining of the conversation, I asked him if he was going to hang up on me and he said no. And by the end of the conversation, I couldn't do anything except hang up because he had done it first. ........I don't even know what to say about how I feel about that. It just hurt so much, I don't even know why the fuck everyone is taking this so hard. It's not like I moved out here to say a big, giant fuck you to all of them, you know? But hey, it's like I said to Aaron, those of you who were really my friends to start out with will be there to welcome my visit back in June. Those of you who never were, won't. We'll see in June."

"event","well, first, when I got home, she was laying on the pillow we put for her in the bathroom. We put her in there to avoid all the mess, ya know. The pillow beneath her was soaking wet, as if she had been laying there for quite some time and couldn't move just to piss. Maybe it was saliva i don't know... but her whole body was limp ....no it was piss. I freaked out at first. I loved this cat a lot. First instinct i had was to feed it. I wanted to save it at first, but she wouldn't voluntarily eat. Her eyes were full of pain and suffering. I should have drowned her right there to save her from herself but like i said before i wanted to save her...to save her life, so I rushed her downstairs to the kitchen. I started puting cooked egg down her throat, warm kittie formula, water, anything I thought would take effect quickly. You see, we were gone all day, and I thought she was just starving. But when she started vomiting everything I had given her, and long skinny worms came out with it, i knew better. Maggots? no.....maggots are short ....small...these were atleast 4 inches long. Maybe 3. So I held her, and after about 3 bouts with this vomiting, i stopped trying to feed her. I just accepted that she was going to die. I figgured all i can do is hold her bc no one wants to die alone. Her breathing slowed first. She was itterally GASPING for any kind of breath. And i had her facing me, on her back sortof...like, I was holding her up. She would go for long seconds at first without breathing and then take one really huge breath which she would reach out with her arms for to get more room.  It kind of hurt to see her reaching out to me like that, even though I know it was just for her breathing. when she would gasp for breath, she would take in a lot all at once and then let it out slowly...and she made a sound.....she wheezed.....it sounded like a cry. it was...torturously beautiful. Well anyways, seconds would turn into minutes and after a while, she just didn't breathe anymore, but she was still alive for a long time after that. Or maybe the breathing was just really shallow and i didn't notice. Her body started turning cold and i knew then that she was in her last minute or so. So, i put her on the bed in the spare bedroom downstairs so she could be most comfortable and watched her lay there. When i had her on the bed, laying wrapped in the towel I had used to clean up the vomit and the worms, (I folded the soiled part inside so it wasn't touching her) I saw her whole body just lose everything...that last little bit of life that was holding onto that body just let go. Her eyes went blank and she lost total control of her body....and soiled the towel again. I held her. I kissed her. I pet her. I cried. it was a long painful experience for the both of us. She took 4 whole hours to die...or atleast what I was there for. Like i said, she was already laying limp when i walked in."

"event","Last night, Rick and I went over to Joe's house. Joe is this guy I used to talk to online about depression and such. So we go to the house, and the BOY has GOT some KNIVES! There were the two butterfly ones, not matching, but fitting to one another none the less, there was the little seraded one that he used to cut himSELF, and then....there was Isis. Isis is beautiful. Big, sharp barbs coming off the sides, double pronged tip, decorative cutaways in the blade....I just couldn't get enough of this one. So, I was playing with it, and I pushed one of the barbs against my skin. I closed my eyes. Wow, it just felt so good to me. I remember keeping my eyes closed, just playing with how much pain I could stand, and eventually, the pain turned into pleasure! I was actually getting off on this pain. It was hot, and intense, all up and down the left side of my body. I felt the sensation in my face... hot... burning... it was JUST like an orgasm, and I can't be sure I didn't really get off completely. It was the closest I've ever gotten to feeling that pleasured besides sex. When I opened my eyes, I noticed that the entire barb had disapeared from sight. This is how wide this barb is from one edge to the other: ----- and this is how long it was: -------- it was only a BIT longer than it was wide. Anyway, the point is, when I looked down and saw it the way I had it, pushed into my skin, I really saw the entire barb enveloped by my flesh. Then when I took it out, slowly, I noticed that all that had really happened was that my skin had folded around it and covered it that way. The only mark I have is a tiny hole made by the tip of it...as opposed to the deep gash I thought there would have been."

I don't really like the Amarillos but the green ones are good. Liliana, have you ever had them? Just wondering. If anyone else knows what I'm talking about, let me know.

"event","Porphyria's Lover

The rain set early in tonight, 
The sullen wind was soon awake, 
It tore the elm-tops down for spite, 
and did its worst to vex the lake: 
I listened with heart fit to break. 
When glided in Porphyria; straight 
She shut the cold out and the storm, 
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate 
Blaze up, and all the cottage warm; 
Which done, she rose, and from her form 
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl, 
And laid her soiled gloves by, untied 
Her hat and let the damp hair fall, 
And, last, she sat down by my side 
And called me. When no voice replied, 
She put my arm about her waist, 
And made her smooth white shoulder bare, 
And all her yellow hair displaced, 
And, stooping, made my cheek lie there, 
And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair, 
Murmuring how she loved me--she 
Too weak, for all her heart's endeavor, 
To set its struggling passion free 
From pride, and vainer ties dissever, 
And give herself to me forever. 
But passion sometimes would prevail, 
Nor could tonight's gay feast restrain 
A sudden thought of one so pale 
For love of her, and all in vain: 
So, she was come through wind and rain. 
Be sure I looked up at her eyes 
Happy and proud; at last I knew 
Porphyria worshiped me: surprise 
Made my heart swell, and still it grew 
While I debated what to do. 
That moment she was mine, mine, fair, 
Perfectly pure and good: I found 
A thing to do, and all her hair 
In one long yellow string I wound 
Three times her little throat around, 
And strangled her. No pain felt she; 
I am quite sure she felt no pain. 
As a shut bud that holds a bee, 
I warily oped her lids: again 
Laughed the blue eyes without a stain. 
And I untightened next the tress 
About her neck; her cheek once more 
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss: 
I propped her head up as before 
Only, this time my shoulder bore 
Her head, which droops upon it still: 
The smiling rosy little head, 
So glad it has its utmost will, 
That all it scorned at once is fled, 
And I, its love, am gained instead! 
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how 
Her darling one wish would be heard. 
And thus we sit together now, 
And all night long we have not stirred, 
And yet God has not said a word! 

-Robert Browning (1812-1889)"

But, um, now I happen to be locked in a cage, and some guy wants me to put on some freakin lotion. ""It does what it's told!"" I told him, if you want me to put on this lotion, give me a computer. So, after this, I'm pretty sure that I will be made into a new dress. I took a shower with Tiff....OMG, that was amazing. I fukken love her. Aaron, get ready. This one is amazing. One of the reasons she was so sic was that she took this shower in pants and a bra. I got to wash her hair for her,and the soap got on her face, so I washed it off for her. and it made me feel really good. I felt the same way when I was keeping her safe at the show. There were so many people crowding her, and I somehow managed to keep everyone off her with just my arms. It made me feel so good. I love Tiff, so there. Um, then, we took pictures and I'll have them up here whenever Eric gets them online. Rick will have to help me since I don't know what I'm doing. dammit. After we all woke up, and got ready, and left, the drive home almost killed Rick. He will never drive on a turnpike or parkway ever again. What the hell is this ""turnpike"" shit anyways? We just simply don't have this shit in IB, mkay?  After we got to the house, which I am calling ""home"" until I leave, he took me to his family's restaurant and I....had......PLANFUKKINGTAINS!!!!!!!! I don't like the yellow ones much, but I'm bringing some of the green ones home for you, Mom. (somebody please call her right now (or at the next most appropriate hour)and tell her I wrote that....Brian....not past 9.) Then, we came home again and slept. I had to make up for 4 days of 2-4 hour naps. I have no idea how long we slept for, but I fukken needed it, that's for sure. Since then, I've just been online off and on, but me and Rick are having fun. I'll update more when more happens. Shit....The fukken lotion. :( *cries*"

He stands in the dark shadow.
Off into the distance, he sees her.
She is so beautiful, beyond all words.
He longs to hold her.....
Just to merely touch her.
Just beyond his reach, she's incomplete.

With tears, so frozen with lonliness, 
Which burn her face with thier darkest kiss, 
Tracks from the frozen 
Tears on her soft skin
Burn her and leave her in bliss. 

He walks out from his shadow. 
Slowly, he reaches out and takes her in his arms. 
She is so beautiful, beyond all words.
He loves to hold her....
Just to merely touch her. 
Now, he holds her close, and is complete.

With love so warm in their sweet embrace,
He wipes the tears and scars from her face.
Where there were tears and crying, before,
He has given her a smile in it's place."

Anyway, your sense of style and originality are your strengths, and people will respect your judgment once they get to know you.

"event","I've had a lot of issues with God lately. For some reason, it's hard for me to throw myslef into his hands to do with me what he will, though I feel very strongly that this is what I SHOULD be doing. When I walk down the street and I find little pamhlets about religion, I always read them (especially if they're in spanish, but that's another story.) and I pick apart what I believe in and what I don't. I also don't want God to see inside me, although I know he does, and he sees everything. There are things inside me that I know God is not proud of, but still forgives me for. I heard somewhere that inorder to be forgiven and clensed of your sins, you have to pray and ASK god to forgive you, but then, I remember John 3:16 and that doesn't make sense. Still, sometimes, I just want to fall to my knees in the middle of where ever I am, even if it's in a crowd, and just tell God everything. I know he knows it all anyway, but it's been a while since we've spoken, and I'm sure he'd like to hear from me. Even now, he knows I'm typing this, and that I want to fall to my knees right now and just speak with him. (he does talk back, if you listen hard enough...) However, he also knows my reluctance to do it, even though I know I should. Now, why should I be so defiant? I'm not doing it to hate God, but as I mentioned before, I'm finding it really hard to let God into my life right now. And why is it that I want to cry right now? I feel like I want God to just pick me up and cradle me, assuring me that everything will end up right in the end, but I know he already is. I think I'm just blind to it. Maybe I want to cry because I don't know whether I see him there for me at this moment, or if I don't believe he hears me at all. I'm sorry for writing that, but as you can see, I'm quite conflicted! I am pushing God out of my life, and begging for him all at once. And for what good? It's getting me nowhere. I can't even bring myself to read the entire Bible...it just seems like too much work. How do I possibly stand before God after I die and tell him that 80 years was not enough time to read his only bestseller? Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."

"event","The Idealist Portrait 
All Idealists (NFs) share the following core characteristics:

Idealists are enthusiastic, they trust their intuition, yearn for romance, seek their true self, prize meaningful relationships, and dream of attaining wisdom.  
Idealists  pride themselves on being loving, kindhearted, and authentic.  
Idealists tend to be giving, trusting, spiritual, and they are focused on personal journeys and human potentials. Idealists make intense mates, nurturing parents, and inspirational leaders. Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self--always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials. Idealists are rare, making up no more than 8 to 10 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers.  

The four types of Idealists are:
Healers (INFP) | Counselors (INFJ) | Champions (ENFP) | Teachers (ENFJ)"

"event","The existing situation is disagreeable. Feels lonely and uncertain as she has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and wants to stand out from the rank and file. This sense of isolation magnifies the need into a compelling urge, all the more upsetting to her self-sufficiency because of the restraint she normally imposes on herself. Since she wants to demonstrate the unique quality of her own character, she tries to suppress this need for others and affects an attitude of unconcerned self-reliance to conceal her fear of inadequacy, treating those who criticize her behavior with contempt. However, beneath this assumption of indifference she really longs for the approval and esteem of others. 

Your Restrained Characteristics: Willing to become emotionally involved and able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity. Believes that she is not receiving her share--that she is neither properly understood nor adequately appreciated. Feels that she is being compelled to conform, and close relationships leave her without any sense of emotional involvement. An unadmitted lack of confidence makes her careful to avoid open conflict and she feels she must make the best of things as they are. Feels cut off and unhappy because of the difficulty in achieving the essential degree of cooperation and harmony which she desires. Your Desired Objective: Has an imperative need for some bond or fusion with another which will prove sensually fulfilling, but which will not conflict with her convictions or sense of fitness. Your Actual Problem: 
Disappointment and the fear that there is no point in formulating fresh goals have led to anxiety, and she is distressed by the lack of any close and understanding relationship. She attempts to escape into a substitute world in which things are more nearly as she desires them to be. Your Actual Problem #2: Greatly impressed by the unique, by originality, and by individuals of outstanding characteristics. Tries to emulate the characteristics she admires and to display originality in her own personality.

"event","the only truly good thing I ever had....the one best friendship I've ever known, the one thing I knew would be with me forever, is gone. Not leaving next month, but gone. i don't even know where the fuck it went wrong or when exactly it happened. all I know is that now, it's too fucking late. I want to fucking cry when I think about it and dammit, I have. It made me feel like I failed. My mom told me that normally, most people will not stay friends for very long. People come into eachothers lives to teach them something, stay for a while, and then go, never to be heard from again because it's easier to live your life without them after that point. .....maybe I'm just done learning...maybe he taught me all he could and has to move on with his life while I move on with mine. But, it still fucking hurts. I just want to know if it really wasn't my fault like my mom said, or if i like, did something to piss him off that badly to where he never trusted me or wanted to speak with me after that. He doesn't even look at this thing anyway, so it doesn't matter what i want. Before, when I would feel this happening, I could play with his hair and just hold him, laying against me....that is so impossible now and not just because he cut his hair. I want to call him and tell him i'm sorry....that i fucked up....that it's not his fault and that I support his decision...but I wouldn't know what to say if I did. All my words leave me, out of shame, when I see him. It's impossible for me to stand infront of such a beautiful person and know what happened. To know it died. To know that he knows it. To know that he knows *I* know it....and for either of us to still do nothing about it. Not because we don't want to (because I know that it's been on BOTH our minds a lot) but because at this point, it really is unfixable. I wish I could just talk to him about it. Maybe ask him...""when did it happen?"" ""do you hate me?"" ""was it really my fault or not?"" But I'd be too afraid he wouldn't answer me anyway. It's well over time to end this. I'm tired and I want to go to bed. goodnight, friend(s)."

"event","Sometimes, I just wish I had more options. The life I lead is not out of preference. Nor is it out of need for abuse, or any other sick thing that would cause me to fucking WANT it. However, let us call it the inability to avoid fucked up circumstances. Sometimes, you are dealt a hand that just doesn't constitute to you winning the game. For example: you love someone with all your heart, and you know they love you, but for some reason, wheather it be conflicting values and beliefs or failure to understand eachother, that love just isn't enough to overpower the great divide between you. This is applicable for lovers, friends, AND family. So far, in the last 3-4 months, this has happened between me and 5 other people. That's more than one each month. Antoher thing that I've had the pleasure of being faced with is having responsibility thrust upon me at a time when I can not even take care of myself. What makes this worse is that the person who did this to me was...ME. I chose to go out and pick up my dog from Mexico in an attempt to ""save her life."" Consequently, I will probably have to give her up because I can't take care of her. This will be ""Alex"" all over again. There really are a lot more, but I just took a typing break to read what I already have, and I just realized that you are probably really bored with this by now anyway. Sorry to take up your time, but lately, that's all I've been good at. I feel like a burden on the world."

There are basically three things that could....no, that are GOING to happen....

Possibility One: Rick is giong to come back to SD to see me again. This will probably result in me not being able to spend very much time with him because, as demonstrated by #49 on da list, what little friends I have won't be able to give me one fucking week out of my life to enjoy it, and he will have to leave after that. I won't even be able to find that side of him that I've been prying at lately. BTW. dammit, Rick, just talk about how you feel, you'll feel much better.

Possibility Two: I could go up there to see HIM. This is nearly impossible b/c of my dog and the fact that I have no goddamnfucking money.
